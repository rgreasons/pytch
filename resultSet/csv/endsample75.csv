Fifteen years and some 80 million albums sold later, the British quartet haven’t elaborated on that philosophy—they’ve just amplified it. Where massive success has a tendency to make bands more jaded and aloof, Coldplay only seem more gobsmacked and in awe of life itself. Their songs aren’t just designed to uplift, they’re often about the very sensation of being uplifted. But on the band’s seventh album, </span><i>A Head Full of Dreams</i><span>, the band’s relentless campaign to raise our spirits is liable to induce altitude sickness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Of course, there’s a perfectly logical reason for the album’s oversold optimism—</span><i>A Head Full of Dreams</i><span> is a reactionary retort to 2014’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19344-coldplay-ghost-stories/""><i>Ghost Stories</i></a><span>, a low-key response to </span><a href=""http://ca.eonline.com/news/536111/chris-martin-sheds-insight-into-gwyneth-paltrow-breakup-i-didn-t-want-to-be-scared-of-love"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>a high-profile split</span></a><span> that literally </span><a href=""http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/20559/homepage_large.38e1b6ab.jpg""><span>wore its (broken) heart on its sleeve</span></a><span>. The new album,</span><span> by contrast, is Martin’s unconscious recoupling record, the sound of a freshly single man stepping out onto the dancefloor to lose his mind and find new love. ""You make me feel like I’m alive again,"" he sings atop the slinky disco of lead single ""Adventure of a Lifetime"", a lyric that succinctly sums up the spirit of the record like a movie poster tagline.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>A Head Full of Dreams</i> is Coldplay’s chance to reassert the eager-to-please exuberance that <i>Ghost Stories</i> deliberately downplayed, and prove that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"">Adele</a> isn’t the only artist who can mobilize a monoculture in 2015. Though written off by detractors as <a href=""https://www.google.ca/search?q=coldplay+%22middle+of+the+road%22&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=657&amp;ei=VsJfVs6aBsPNePW3s8AJ&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>middle of the road</span></a>, Coldplay’s centrist position is what ultimately makes them so singular—they’re the only rock band that could (and would want to) wrangle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>, Noel Gallagher, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31247-to-love/"">Tove Lo</a>, Norwegian Top 40 architects Stargate, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a> producer Daniel Green, alt-rock lifer Nik Simpson, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJDnJ0vXUgw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m43s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>“Gimme Shelter” scene-stealer</span></a> Merry Clayton on the same record. <i>A Head Full of Dreams</i> is emblematic of Coldplay’s burning desire to be all things to all people, rolling up symphonic Britpop bluster, club-thumping bangers, dentist-office soft rock, finger-snapping R&amp;B, and even some trippy touches that remind you of a time when this band just wanted to be as popular as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev/"">Mercury Rev</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But the album </span><span>has bigger ambitions. By weaving a spoken-word reading of </span><a href=""http://allpoetry.com/poem/8534703-The-Guest-House-by-Mewlana-Jalaluddin-Rumi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>an inspirational 13th-century Persian poem</span></a><span> and a sample of Barack Obama reciting ""Amazing Grace"" into the mix, the album essentially conflates Martin’s post-rebound optimism with an all-encompassing, heal-the-world mission. His </span>relentless need to take us higher feels most genuine when we get a sense of what got him so low in the first place. ""Everglow"" and the Tove Lo collab ""Fun"" bring ultimate closure to the Gwyneth saga with a pledge to enduring friendship (and, to prove it, the former track features Martin’s ex on backing vocals). And despite bearing a title that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co6WMzDOh1o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">isn’t going to dispel</a> their poor-man’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"">U2</a> rep, ""Amazing Day"" is a sweet ode to blossoming, post-divorce romance that channels the winsome charm of early singles like ""Shiver"". Best of all is ""Birds"", a shot of taut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"">Phoenix</a>-styled motorik pop that provides a rare moment of intensity on an album that’s all about arm-swaying, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62376-coldplay-to-headline-super-bowl-halftime-show-beyonce-in-talks-for-guest-appearance/"">Super Bowl-crashing</a> bombast.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Even when </span><i>A Head Full of Dreams</i><span> hints at experimentation, it inevitably drifts back onto predictable paths. The title track eases us into the album on a glistening groove </span><span>but halts its momentum for a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/484-arcade-fires-funeral-and-the-legacy-of-the-whoa-oh/""><span>now-obligatory ""woah oh oh oh"" breakdown</span></a><span> that sounds like it was focus-grouped into the song. When Martin sings ""I feel my heart beating"" on ""Adventure of a Lifetime"", the arrangement drops out, save for a throbbing bassline that mimics the sound of, well, take a guess. And the readymade, gospelized charidee-anthem-in-waiting ""Up&amp;Up"" sees many of the aforementioned guests get together to sing, ""we’re gonna get it together,"" before Gallagher delivers a send-off guitar solo that essentially turns the track into Coldplay’s Perrier Supernova. At one point in the song, Martin asks, ""How can people suffer/ How can people part/ How can people struggle/ How can people break your heart?"" He doesn’t profess to understand the root of all our problems, but he’ll do his damnedest to provide a cure anyway.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For all the record's eclecticism, Coldplay remain a band that put the ""us"" in ""obvious,"" blowing up the simplest sentiments for maximum appeal. Nearly every song is about ascension and transcendence, be it through intoxicants (the Beyoncé-assisted ""Hymn for the Weekend""), rocket ships (the unlisted, listless slow jam ""X Marks the Spot""), out-of-body experiences (bonus track ""Miracles""), large ocean waves (""Fun""), rooftop stargazing (""Amazing Day""), winged creatures (""Birds""), or just sheer force of will (""Up&amp;Up""—and this from a band that’s already written a song called </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhLJfw3t5hE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Up With the Birds""</span></a><span>). But Martin has a tendency to sing of extraordinary, mind-expanding experiences in muddled metaphors (""My army of one is going to fight for you … my heart is my gun"") and rote ""high""/""sky"" rhymes. And with his many wide-eyed ruminations on stars and moons and hearts and diamonds, it can sound like he gets his lyrical inspiration from a spoonful of Lucky Charms. Martin </span><a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/coldplay-and-chris-martin-open-up-for-new-album-1447868383"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>recently told the </span><span>Wall Street Journal</span></a><span> that he wanted ""Hymn for the Weekend"" to be the sort of single that would soundtrack a bottle-service bender at a nightclub and, essentially, that spirit of bonhomie permeates the entirety of </span><i>A Head Full of Dreams</i><span>. Except too often, the album’s pat platitudes place us on the other side of the velvet rope, left to ponder the sight of some self-satisfied people having the time of their lives.</span></p></div>"|21321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21321-a-head-full-of-dreams/|4.8|Stuart Berman

These guys wouldn't be successful entertainers without that instinct.</p>
<p>iLoveMakonnen is one of a few genuinely engaging artists on Snapchat. When he Snaps himself covered in blankets in a cold hotel room, or of himself confronting pre-show jitters, his personality comes through so clearly it's hard to not feel moved. He's always seemed like a genuinely unique and humble guy, maybe somewhat performatively so. But what social media isn't in some way performative?<i><br/></i></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This matters in perceiving Makonnen's art because his relatability has always worked in his favor, even when some of his songs threaten to go off-the-rails, since his limited voice can only take him so far. He seems like a guy you know. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17041-ilovemakonnen-club-goin-up-on-a-tuesday-ft-drake/"">""Tuesday""</a> was a giant hit because it nailed something about the melancholy one feels when out on a weekday—it feels liberating, because so few people are out, but it can also be a stark reminder of the aimlessness that comes when you're unemployed, or depressed, or, in the conceit of the song, dealing drugs on the weekend. But those details didn't matter. We've all had a Tuesday (or Wednesday, or Thursday) night end far later than it should have. And it struck the kind of relatable chord that <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> does well, which naturally led to his golden co-sign.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Fast-forward a year and after this spring's experimental but quietly compelling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20473-drink-more-water-5/""><i>Drink More Water 5</i></a> mixtape, and Makonnen has released the official follow-up to his first EP on OVO Sound. Some of these songs have floated around for a year or so and are staples of his live performances. But more than even the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19774-ilovemakonnen-ilovemakonnen-ep/"">first EP</a>, which delivered a handful of great hip-hop-indebted pop songs, this sequel EP bursts with a confidence that's earned after you go through the hit-song-now-what? grinder. Compared to his last mixtape, the hooks are sharp enough to cut glass, and the sequencing ensures that every facet of Makonnen<span>—</span>from Heartbroken Makonnen to Riotous Makonnen to Warble Makonnen to Onomatopoeia Sex Jam Makonnen<span>—</span>alternates every song.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On the lights-down, open-curtain starter ""Forever"", Makonnen hits the ground running: ""I remember when you said you needed a love that lasted forever,"" before the ominous beat finally drops. The open-throated ballad kicks off his second EP as ably as Tom Cruise scaling a mountain during the first moments of <i>Mission: Impossible 2</i>. By the time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"">Santigold</a> shows up to memorably rap a few bars, the hooks (literal and figurative) have sunken in—Makonnen is aiming for the fences with his pop instincts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">However, the record is at its best in the contemplative heartfelt-loner love songs, like ""Second Chance"" and ""Being Alone With U"", in which Makonnen embodies his hip-hop-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a> role. Closer ""I Loved You"" perfects this formula with a stark piano on a trap beat. Makonnen offers formulaic Drake-isms like ""I know you think about me when I'm not around,"" but they feel fresh in context because we feel like WeKnowMakonnen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Trust Me Danny"" is the EP's signature moment, a windows-down banger that pays homage both to Makonnen's producer Danny Wolf and <a href=""https://vine.co/v/OwYMv2u6vIa"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a viral Vine</a>. It encapsulates Makonnen's aesthetic as well as his target audience—fans and students of hip-hop who recognize that hooks need to sail for maximum effect for a track to land as a rap anthem. Makonnen isn't another ""weird"" rapper cashing in, making disposable jokes and internet references for a Twitter-ready crowd before everyone wakes up and goes, ""Where are the hits? Where are the hooks?"" On this EP, he's angling to be a real pop star, to step out of the OVO shadow (which hasn't produced a major pop crossover artist since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>) and onto the radio. It's hard to know if that'll happen, but coming with a likable persona, real pop-songwriting chops, and an established audience never hurt anybody.</p></div>"|21292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21292-ilovemakonnen-2/|7.6|Matthew Ramirez

There's nothing really harmful about this interpretation, but acting like a rock band—a euphemism for ""had a frontman""—isn't really what separated Underworld from their peers. After all, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3402-the-prodigy/"">Prodigy</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">Chemical Brothers</a> both worked in the album format to great effect, and, like Underworld, their live shows and general demeanor had more in common with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"">Oasis</a> than with, say, Spiral Tribe. In fact, what truly makes Underworld unique, and what coincidentally most closely aligns them with rock bands, is that they took themselves <i>really</i> seriously; their ambitions leaned to the serious and important. Unlike most people—lots of ravers included—they thought these things could be achieved using the rave template.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Second Toughest in the Infants</i> is the band's second, spectacular attempt at making big, important rave music, and their second with young fusionist DJ Darren Emerson helping steer the ship (frontman Karl Hyde and Rick Smith had been making music, in one style or another, since the early '80s). It was reissued for its 20th anniversary this November, in both two- and four-CD editions, remastered and bundled with exclusive and/or unreleased extras. You can see the band posing in the album title, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Toughest_in_the_Infants"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">funny little comment made by Smith's nephew</a> that conveniently reads like poetic word soup. You see this, probably, before you realize the album opens with a 16-minute, three-part suite entitled ""Juanita : Kiteless : To Dream of Love"" and follows that with a 15-minute, two-part suite entitled ""Banstyle/Sappys Curry"". There it is, comrades: a heaping helping of Big, Important Music. If you want funny voices and funny haircuts, the Prodigy are in the tent to the left.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The great thing about mid-'90s Underworld is they made this beat-poetry-cum-rave-anthem splice work against the odds. Their secret was to act as if Hyde was not a vocalist at all but rather a particularly charismatic sampler: spitting out short, repetitive phrases that were afforded little more purchase on a track's mix than any other melodic curlicue. As an album, and as disc one of this reissue, <i>Second Toughest</i> holds up marvelously, dominated by the shapeshifting opening tracks but also featuring fan-favorite ""Confusion the Waitress"" and the stupefying ""Pearl's Girl"", perhaps the fist-pumping-est epic in a discography chockablock with them. ""Stagger"", the tormented kosmische saga that closes the affair, betrays the band's album-centric aspirations and beats <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"">Thom Yorke</a> to the meandering electro-ballad by a decade.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The band's profile raised considerably<i> </i>with<i> Second Toughest, </i>which<i> </i>roughly coincided with the release of <i>Trainspotting</i>, the film making prominent use of non-album track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7852-the-top-200-tracks-of-the-1990s-50-21/2/"">""Born Slippy.NUXX""</a>. The track's popularity, and its association with the movie, perhaps unfairly tethers the band's sound to the '90s, though there's some comfort in remembering a time when music this loopy and progressive could dominate (European) airwaves.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Disc two reproduces all of the exclusive material from the absurdly good <i>Pearl's Girl </i>EP—five long pieces over 35 minutes that would stand as most band's best work even before adding the worthy reworks of the title track—and adds ""Born Slippy (Instrumental Version)"", which functionally has almost nothing to do with the more famous NUXX version, as well as ""Born Slippy.Nuxx (Deep Pan)"", an intriguing but ultimately boring remix.</p>
<p>Disc three offers a full slate of unreleased material, some of which (""D+B Thing"", ""Techno Thang"", ""D'Arbly St"") gives away its throwaway nature by its title. ""D'Arbly"", meanwhile is seven minutes of downtempo lounge noodling. Only an extra version of ""Pearl's"" and ""Bloody 1"", yet another loopy 16-minute epic (Underworld could do no wrong in this format in the mid '90s), rescue this disc. Disc four offers seven (!) different versions of ""Born Slippy.NUXX"" (often simply titled ""Nuxx""), several of them live. The main takeaway here is that you do not, in fact, want Hyde's scintillating vocal melody to continue for the entire runtime, no matter how much you think you love the opening minutes. But the disc also illustrates how much Underworld has in common with a jam band, iterating over long passages, massaging a track into form.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Second Toughest</i> marks the last time Underworld's blend of ferocity, earnestness, and expanse felt transcendent. By the time they returned with <i>Beaucoup Fish</i> in 1998 they seemed more like an institution than a contender. But there's an absolute trove of potent material associated with <i>Second Toughest</i>; lesser bands might've mined this period for two or even three albums. The remasters sound great, and the two-disc version makes exploration reasonable for the unfamiliar, though both the original album and the essential <i>Pearl's Girl </i>EP can be had for a song in your local used bin. For the fanatic, the four-disc version offers a couple of gems and a thorough examination of the genesis of the band's most famous track, i.e. exactly the type of thing you might hope for from a not-explicitly-necessary reissue. Underworld made a point of going deeper, and carrying on for longer, than most bands would dare; they're worthy of a reissue that does the same.</span></p></div>"|21265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21265-second-toughest-in-the-infants/|8.8|Andrew Gaerig

She saw <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a> spin for the first time at a party in Montreal, where it was pretty much everyone's first encounter with footwork in a club setting. She and her friends ended up spending a week with the Chicago DJ, and he gave them a batch of tracks he'd produced with his Ghettoteknitianz crew. It opened up a whole new world for her. ""That folder is still one of the main folders I go to for inspiration,"" she told <i><a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/11/13/zora-jones-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Fader</a></i>. ""Those tracks are so crisp to me and so influential. 2010 was the year for me.""</p>
<p>You can hear the late Rashad's influence on Jones' debut EP, <i>100 Ladies</i>—or at least, you can deduce it. Many of her tracks move at 160 BPM, smack in the middle of footwork's sweet spot. But in the past five years, Jones has also established her own sound, one that's indebted to footwork (and also to grime), but irreducible to either of those genres. It's several steps removed—and that's a direct result of the work that she's put in.</p>
<p>The title of the Austria-born, Barcelona-based producer's EP is a reference to a pact that she made with herself: to make 100 tracks before she released anything. This isn't the first thing she has unveiled; there have been collaborations with Sinjin Hawke and DJ Taye on <a href=""http://fractalfantasy.net"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FractalFantasy</a> (the imprint she runs with Hawke, which began life as an online outlet for audiovisual productions), and she's posted the odd solo track to her <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/zora-jones"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SoundCloud</a> account. But this is her first extended statement, and the singularity of her vision is immediately apparent.</p>
<p>Aside from the occasional anchoring 808 kick, she favors thin, silvery sounds: brittle rimshots, tinny hi-hats, and 808 toms tuned toward their upper limits. Her main instrument is the voice—resampled, stacked in dizzying fifths, pitched up near dog-whistle frequency, and painted on in bright, loopy brushstrokes. Put together, these elements combine to suggest club music injected with helium and sent bobbing high overhead.</p>
<p>Of the album's seven tracks, only two come anywhere close to resembling established forms. ""Zui"", with its shuddering 808 patterns and stuttering monosyllables, wears its footwork influences proudly on its sleeve, and the lurching cadence of ""Too Many Tears"" sounds like an outgrowth of the ""weightless"" style of grime favored by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29215-mumdance/"">Mumdance</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/32640-rabit/"">Rabit</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32732-murlo/"">Murlo</a>. Again, though, her wordless vocal melodies stand proudly apart; they're eerie, shapeshifting things, part violin and part warbling bird, and their effect is spellbinding.</p>
<p>The EP is bookended by its best tracks. The footwork-tempo closer ""First Light"" pumps away like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a> rearranged for tin whistle, Gameboy, and chipmunk, while the opening ""Oh Boy"" forsakes drums entirely; it's just wordless vocal trills pitched up into icy configurations accompanied by the hollow hum of whirly tubes. Despite their novelty, both songs remain unusually moving; for all the flyaway nature of her sounds, her compositions carry real emotional weight. They offer the equivalent of a solid musical form being melted down and channeled into tiny, sidewinding rivulets; it will be fascinating to see where these streams carry her next.</p></div>"|21318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21318-100-ladies-ep/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

In pieces that stretch anywhere from 10 minutes to nearly an hour in length, Melnyk delivers a sustained flurry of high-speed arpeggiated notes. By holding down the sustain pedal, he allows tones to ring out indefinitely, creating droning ambience and phantom melodies.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The pursuit of continuous music has brought Melnyk impressive chops—his website boasts that he is the fastest pianist in the world—but little in the way of critical recognition or financial reward. In interviews, he has<a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Resident+Advisor+Lubomyr"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> expressed some disappointment</a> at falling through the music industry's cracks, his playing too unorthodox for the classical establishment and too traditional for the experimental music community. However, in the last several years, Melnyk has begun to connect with a larger audience through releases on small labels like <a href=""http://www.unseenworlds.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unseen Worlds</a> and <a href=""http://www.erasedtapes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erased Tapes</a>, which concentrate on modern classical and electronic music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Rivers and Streams</i><span> is Melnyk's third release for Erased Tapes. In execution, it's not too different from his previous works for the label. The music is busy and technique-intensive, but tuneful and meditative. As Melnyk plays, his melodies meld together, shifting in tone and volume. Because he allows the piano to resonate, the sound blurs, turning concise and complex patterns into aural fog. According to the composer, the album is a meditation on water—not a huge stretch given the steady, trickling, ambient nature of Melnyk's style. The performances are enhanced via co-production from label founder Robert Raths and London-based composer, Jamie Perera, who modestly augment Melnyk's arrangements with guitar.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Informed by the work of American minimalists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>, Melnyk's music draws on repetition and also a certain degree of impromptu inspiration. However, those composers—Riley in particular—often employed alternate tunings and distinctive harmonies that helped to distance their compositions from Western classical music. Melnyk's music is just as expansive, but more conservative in its approach to harmony. He's more overtly romantic. Listening to the plaintive minor key melodies on ""Parasol"", you can understand how, for some, the pianist's sensibility might have crossed the sometimes-thin line that divides minimalist classical and new age.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">However, this is less of a liability than it might have been in the past. New age is no longer the reviled genre it once was. And there are other, more appropriate modern parallels. Melnyk's shifting chords and rising crescendos will click easily for those who follow post-rock bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions in the Sky</a>. And in continuous playing, sustained repetition, and simple harmony you can also hear him as a more organic cousin to the burbling synthesizer music of '70s groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashra_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ashra</a>. This is not machine music, though. It's very human—serenity delivered through sustained concentration and ecstatic energy, via a lifetime of practice and perfection rather than the twist of a knob.</p></div>"|21322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21322-rivers-and-streams/|7.2|Aaron Leitko

Sunn O))) began as a tribute of sorts to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>, the influential duo whose low, slow riffs and steadfast amplifier worship established the doom-metal mold that Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley were trying to fill anew. And for the first few years, that was the limit of the pair's output—lumbering riffs, played at a near-tectonic pace and deliriously high volumes.</p>
<p>During the next half-decade, however, Anderson and O'Malley evolved. They incorporated a constellation of metal, noise and experimental guests into a series of high-concept records—<i>White1</i>, <i>White2</i>, and <i>Black One</i>, each of which expanded the pair's personnel and possibilities.They staged high-profile, full-length collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18861-sunn-o-ulver-terrestrials/"">counterparts</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19946-sunn-o-scott-walker-soused/"">heroes</a>. They turned concerts in clubs and cathedrals alike into frame-shattering, wall-shaking temporary installations, where robes, fogs, and <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sunno-stageplot.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a shrine of their namesake amplifiers</a> shaped a sort of heavy-metal happening. More than a 10-year anniversary, those 2008 shows represented chances to jettison the excess and prove that the anchoring idea—chords played so long and loud the listener heard every overtone and felt every subtle change—remained potent. The new art-metal masters wanted to show they could still get back to basics.</p>
<p><span>A year after those concerts, Sunn O))) issued <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i>, </span><span>an aptly named colossus that folded a horn section, a choir, a string </span><span>section, a blown conch shell and black metal legend Attila Csihar </span><span>speaking slowly into four pieces that were just ridiculous and </span><span>divergent enough to work. In the years since, collaborations with </span><span>Ulver and Scott Walker have also pushed Anderson and O’Malley farther </span><span>beyond the early, atavistic comforts of Earth. </span><i>Kannon</i> is the first complete Sunn O))) since <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i>, and it likewise documents a return to the elements for Anderson and O'Malley. Cut with a cast of familiar collaborators playing mere support roles to Anderson, O'Malley, and their amplifiers, <i>Kannon </i>reneges on that progression with a triptych of elegant yet underwhelming arcs and drones. It is typically loud. It is often pretty. It is, cumulatively, the first minor full-length studio album of Sunn O)))'s career.</p>
<p>There are, no doubt, many beautiful and bracing passages throughout <i>Kannon</i>. Few musicians can summon the same mix of patience, intensity, roar, and meticulousness as Anderson and O'Malley; it's wonderful to hear them interact in the pristine, refined acoustic setting offered by producer Randall Dunn. Near the midsection of ""Kannon 1"", the bass, guitar, Csihar's obscured voice, and a capillary of feedback lock into a perfect unison. Even delivered through headphones, the sound is somehow paralyzing and exhilarating, as though a team of masseurs has just found all the right pressure points. The playing is so careful and the recording so crisp that, during ""Kannon 3"", you can listen to chords and notes arrive one by one and track their slow disappearance into the din around them. It's like watching time-lapse footage of solitary raindrops forming a deep puddle.</p>
<p>But where <i>Kannon</i> exceeds as a collection of moments, it fails as both an album and an experience, especially given the general Sunn O))) scale. Brevity may be the only truly <i>new</i> idea the band incorporates here, as these three tracks just break the 33-minute mark. But Anderson and O'Malley don't seem to have squeezed the normal complications and layers into a tighter space so much as omitted them altogether. ""Kannon 1"" slowly gathers its riffs, pulling back the stage curtains for the subterranean rattle of an oddly subdued Csihar. ""Kannon 2"" begins with a wrestling match with a guitar that resolves in feedback and, again, introduces a familiar choir of incantatory voices, all surrounded by a wispy veil of electronic oscillations. The album's most unexpected instant actually comes at that song's end, when one massive, static bass note hangs still in the air. Percussion jostles beneath it, as though the enormous tone were rattling a household cupboard. Rather than explore the strange sound, Sunn O))) simply shut down the amps and discard it. And that's the problem, really: <i>Kannon </i>feels underdeveloped and rushed, like the start of a project that's been delivered prematurely. </p>
<p>Since the release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13195-monoliths-dimensions/""><i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i></a>, Anderson and O'Malley have taken very separate paths. Anderson has <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2015/09/goatsnake_touri.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">re-launched</a> the blues'n'doom outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24732-goatsnake/"">Goatsnake</a> and <a href=""http://southernlord.com/releases/index/page:2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">retooled his label, Southern Lord</a>, for old-school hardcore, crusty metal, and crossover fare. O'Malley, on the other hand, <a href=""http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/nazoranai/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">started </a>an improvisational band with Keiji Haino and Oren Ambarchi, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19349-oren-ambarchi-stephen-omalley-randall-dunn-shade-themes-from-kairos/"" target=""_blank"">scored</a> a film, <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2015/07/16/sunn-os-stephen-omalley-releases-new-lp-gruides-on-demdike-stares-dds-label/http://www.factmag.com/2015/07/16/sunn-os-stephen-omalley-releases-new-lp-gruides-on-demdike-stares-dds-label/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">composed </a>for an orchestra, <a href=""http://issueprojectroom.org/event/tectonics-luciers-omalley-ambarchi-kang-dumitrescu-more"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performed</a> a new Alvin Lucier work, and <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/releases/ideologic-organ/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">launched</a> a label devoted to such interests. That tension has long been an animating, thrilling force for Sunn O))). On <i>Kannon</i>, though, Anderson and O'Malley have opted to avoid rather than embrace it, to find a middle ground of compromise that steers safely away from the frisson of conflict. At least they sound good doing it.</p></div>"|21286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21286-kannon/|6.5|Grayson Haver Currin

<p dir=""ltr"">Pope John Paul II, for context, released <i>three</i> albums during his papacy. They consisted of classical sacred music, and none inspired fond remembrances by the executives who released them (the Pope's records ""shipped gold and returned platinum"", one industry insider<a href=""shipped%20gold%20and%20returned%20platinum,%22""> recently quipped to Billboard</a>). Pope Francis might be different: He is our meme Pope, the Pope of <a href=""https://twitter.com/kimkardashian/status/647070628659380225"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kim Kardashian tweets </a>and <a href=""https://vine.co/v/exr9rxlzM0x"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">re-Vines</a>. <span>Just this week, he found himself the subject of a </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=news&amp;q=%23popebars&amp;src=typd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">#Popebars</a><span> hashtag that imagined him spitting raps by </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/Chef_Lu_Bu/status/671407128939241473"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eminem</a><span> and </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/JamesLedwaba_/status/671300647992602624"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a><span>.</span> <span> The Holy See's populace is growing increasingly unruly, and </span>it's a trip to hear this confusion worked out musically in the age of Spotify.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With collaborators that include a folk-swami, a theatrical lyricist, and a former member of Italian prog-rock band Le Orme,<i> Wake Up!</i> exists at a tremendously strange midpoint between a two-hour mass and a corporate recruitment video. It’s like you drank a bunch of cough syrup and went to <i>Live Aid: The Vatican.</i> Every track features a Barnes &amp; Noble-CD-section pop instrumental, sometimes with additional choral or solo vocals, building momentum that halts when Pope Francis starts speaking. The opening track is ""<span id=""docs-internal-guid-d081c32d-6392-03ef-7643-e6c7c5b40a33""><span>Annuntio Vobis Gaudium Magnum</span></span>!"", the Latin for ""we announce with great joy."" Following that phrase is an assumed ""habemus papem,"" or ""we have a new pope,"" and the excerpted speech is Pope Francis’s first one after being appointed. It’s a powerful moment to commemorate, only slightly compromised by the fact that the instrumental sounds like a holiday-themed IMAX.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The song titles in <i>Wake Up!</i>, exclamation-point-loaded and decidedly outré, are in many ways better than the songs themselves. There’s a climate change track (""Cuidar El Planeta""); another track whose title translates to ""The Church Cannot Be an NGO!"", and one in Spanish that translates to ""Faith is whole, does not liquefy!"" There’s a track in Italian whose title translates to ""Do not steal the hope!"", and a closing track in Portuguese whose title translates to ""Do what he tells you!"" Only the title track (in full, ""Wake Up! Go! Go! Forward!"") bears a name in English.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On it, Pope Francis speaks to a crowd after wheeling streaks of electric guitar, a cinematic horn section, the track gridded loosely by a high-hat. ""It is a duty to be vigilant,"" he intones, to a crowd in South Korea, as a light revue piano tinkles in the background. ""To not allow the pressures, the temptations and the sins to dull our sensibility of the beauty of holiness."" But, if this album is the indication, beauty isn't exactly holiness's sound.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But there is something beautiful about this album; it <i>exists</i>. Pope Francis, already a more human papal figure than any in recent history, is humanized even further by this album's total musical awkwardness, its bewildering genre, its pluralistic good heart. The album's producer Don Giulio Neroni—who produced Pope John Paul II's 1999 choral album; the Vatican is on a relaxed release schedule, but a release schedule all the same—told <i>Rolling Stone </i>that he ""tried to be strongly faithful to the pastoral and personality of Pope Francis: the Pope of dialogue, open doors, hospitality."" He succeeded. Chill Pope, the leader of 1.2 billion people, urges you to accept this weird-ass album as your spiritual Genesis, your graceless way of saying Yes.   </p></div>"|21235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21235-wake-up/|5.0|Jia Tolentino

Reid, developed a form of pop soul that's as geometrically precise as it is weightless. Songs like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRFEz2MjZgg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toni Braxton’s ""Breathe Again""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMqIQhiJdvs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Madonna’s ""Take a Bow""</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N9opF-PK5k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boyz II Men’s ""Water Runs Dry""</a> occur in a seamless universe, all undisturbed surfaces that relentlessly shimmer. In 1995, ""Water Runs Dry"" itself seemed the most formally perfect incarnation of one of Babyface's primary pop expressions, the vaporous ballad; it’s gently animated by a brushed snare and an acoustic guitar, over which the members of Boyz II Men weave their voices together in fluid braids.</p>
<p>Babyface’s aesthetic is a distant refinement and elaboration of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> and, beyond that, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a>, both of whom condensed pop and soul into irreducible collage. He’s capable of elastic funk and vast balladry but both are organized by an unusual pop sensitivity. <i>Return of the Tender Lover</i>, his first solo album of originals in 10 years, is part a period of renewed productivity for Babyface. Last year he released an album with Toni Braxton called <i>Love, Marriage &amp; Divorce</i>, which described the length of a relationship through both gliding surfaces and reduced, raw circumstances; this year he contributed minimal blossoms of acoustic guitar to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> single <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/tydollasign/solid"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Solid""</a>. But his new album is a kind of retreat—Babyface reduced to plush textures. Though <i>Return of the Tender Lover</i> deliberately references his sophomore album, 1989’s <i>Tender Lover</i>, nothing here is as dry and muscular as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lECDTb2G1hY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It’s No Crime""</a>, or generously expansive as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRx-BY1Z9sk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Whip Appeal""</a>. In their place is buoyant, effortless pop soul.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It sometimes feels like a conscious inversion of </span><i>Love, Marriage &amp; Divorce</i><span>; where that record was often capable of a fluorescent hostility, </span><i>Return of the Tender Lover</i><span> almost exclusively communicates security and support. ""We've Got Love"" and ""Love and Devotion"" convey an inflexible confidence, and the songs also seem supportive in their structure, as if engineered for maximum uplift. Babyface’s voice is as smooth as it's ever been, but it’s also always been somewhat granular in design; it sounds like a bloom of smoke.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">El DeBarge appears on ""Walking on Air"", his first duet with Babyface since 1994’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDzeRnToMhM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Where Is My Love""</a>; like Babyface, DeBarge has been minimally present in the music industry over the past ten years, except for a solo album, <i>Second Chance</i>, in 2010, and in brief flourishes on DJ Quik records. His presence here is satisfying both texturally and textually, and ""Walking on Air"" is as rich and vivid as their previous collaborations. DeBarge’s voice is miraculously preserved, an incandescent peal capable of infinite ascent; in ""Walking on Air"", it seems to land somewhere in the troposphere. The only other collaboration on the record is with After 7, an R&amp;B group from the '90s that contains two of Babyface’s brothers. On ""I Want You"", they supply harmonies, adding considerable weight to Babyface’s nimble vocal, and repeating the title until it melts into a kind of plural exhalation.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The collaborations on <i>Return of the Tender Lover</i> and the design of its production feel traditional, in the sense that they don't attempt to update Babyface's sound and instead lean comfortably on a long, established career. This dedication to tradition and honoring of his craft is less a throwback than a micro-adjustment of an enduring formula.</p></div>"|21228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21228-return-of-the-tender-lover/|7.2|Brad Nelson

Punk tempo supplies the adrenaline injection that metal's compositional superiority clearly needs. Massachusetts' Magic Circle are a variation on this principle: its members come from a variety of hardcore and punk bands, such as Mind Eraser, the Rival Mob, Innumerable Forms, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22515-doomriders/"">Doomriders</a>, and they make traditional metal with a deceptively youthful spunk. Even as most of its members were known figures in their home state, Magic Circle's debut still came out of nowhere in a sense: who knew they were capable of <i>this</i>? Their second record, <i>Journey Blind</i>, doesn't have the mystique of the first, but it makes up by being more assertive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With its faster rhythms paying homage to that nook when NWOBHM was picking up but thrash hadn't quite emerged, the lead-off title track shows the influence of Stone Dagger, which features bassist Justin DeTore, vocalist Brendan Radigan, and guitarist Chris Corry, bleeding into Magic Circle. Don't get fooled by the Mellotron intro and think this will be a prog effort. Corry, along with Dan Ducas, turn every melody and lead into a hesher motivational speech. ""The Damned Man"" takes the majesty of the title track and gives it a more proto-thrash, biker-like thrust. Radigan is the ideal vocalist for this material, going in for maximum horn-raising wailing while maintaining a tough edge in most of the verses.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Another spirit that Magic Circle absorb, albeit not as obvious, is that of early Pentagram. Radigan's vocal range is greater than that of Bobby Liebling's, but he is able to convey darkness with a light of hope shining through, like Liebling before he descended into the path that's been covered to death elsewhere already. ""Ghost of the Southern Front"" is where the Pentagram influence really emerges, with Corry and Ducas adding a macabre boogie to their riffing. Their ending solos have that purgatorial feeling of Pentagram's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XicyJnv_8Ds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Death Row""</a>, perfect for looping. Closer ""Antedivullan"" begins with a softer passage not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcmKTNhPk8U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""After Forever""</a>, and when they rage into their standard battle charge, the song's placements gives it a do-or-die urgency. Much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"">Metallica</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTZsCCxx17w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Damage Inc.""</a>, it's a choice anthem for going down swinging.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Magic Circle belong to a special group of new traditionalist bands alongside High Spirits, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32784-crypt-sermon/"">Crypt Sermon</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32768-ranger/"">Ranger</a>, Iron Age, and (on the more progressive, much weirder end) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31121-vhol/"">VHÖL</a>. All of these bands wear their influences on their battle jackets while bringing a real hunger to the table. <i>Journey</i> isn't just a great heavy metal record, it also dismantles the narrative that punk was put on earth to rid rock of its excesses. Hardcore kids can do something with more complicated structures too, and can draw the same sense of purpose that metal has been excellent in instilling for decades.</p></div>"|21263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21263-journey-blind/|7.6|Andy O'Connor

In 2012, he caught the attention of British DJ and tastemaker Gilles Peterson, who included the musician’s <a href=""https://brownswoodrecordings.bandcamp.com/track/nine-winning-wives"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nine Winning Wives""</a> on <i>Brownswood Bubblers</i> <i>Nine </i>and signed Duke to his Brownswood imprint in 2013. Duke released long player <a href=""https://diggsduke.bandcamp.com/album/offering-for-anxious"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Offering for Anxious</i></a> on the label that year, and made what I thought was a nice splash on 2014’s <a href=""https://diggsduke.bandcamp.com/album/the-upper-hand-other-grand-illusions"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Upper Hand &amp; Other Grand Illusions</i></a>, a quick EP that dissected the power struggles in romantic relationships. </p>
<p>On <i>Civil Circus</i>, Duke reverts to the soulful sound he employed on <i>Anxious</i>, yet the vibe here is firmly rooted in jazz. Album opener ""Busker"", with its mix of saxophones and live drums, works well in intimate spaces and carries a strong hip-hop knock. While some of the tracks are traditional in scope, others have an alternative slant that fit alongside artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Flying Lotus</a>, both of whom put esoteric spins on funk, EDM, and rap.</p>
<p><i>Civil Circus </i>is full of shape-shifting compositions that make the album feel longer than its 26-minute runtime in a good way. The music feels remarkably spacious, and Duke’s songwriting is equally abstract and observational: <i>Civil Circus </i>conveys Duke’s innermost thoughts, no matter how vast or disconnected they might be. There’s a voyeuristic aspect to the album, and <i>Civil Circus</i> feels like a deep chat with a close friend. It’s almost gospel-like, and ""Compensation""—a poem by Paul Laurence Dunbar—hits the theme head-on: ""God, in his great compassion/ Gave me the gift of song."" ""Stoplight Lessons"" speaks to the newness of life and uncertainty of growing older. ""Old enough to crawl,"" Duke hums atop an acoustic guitar, ""but speech evades your grasp.""</p>
<p>The album's structure gives way to a loose instrumental procession toward the end: ""Street Preacher"" and ""Bumper to Bumper"" stamp the LP’s panoramic view; ""Damn Near Home"", with its light horns and scenic moans, sets the scene for album closer ""We Don’t Need Love"", which chides superficiality. It’s a fitting end for the album and the impressive career Diggs has built so far. <i>Civil Circus</i> is about being honest and vulnerable. It's about looking up to observe the small things that make life so fruitful, and taking the time to appreciate what's normally taken for granted.</p></div>"|20996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20996-civil-circus/|7.4|Marcus J.

Such mystery had long <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">become</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"">a</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">cliché</a> by this point, but uncertain authorship suited these bulbous, sparkly audio objects, which seemed to float down out of the sky like a cluster of neon-colored balloons ready to pop. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15625-sophie-bipp/"">""Bipp""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15607-elle/"">""Elle""</a>—the former impossibly buoyant with an earworm vocal line, the latter featuring deep bass and chasms of space, a bright and twinkly counterpoint to the grim tone common to dubstep—promised that future music was going to be weirder and more disorienting than we imagined but that it would also function as a bent version of popular song.</p>
<p>Two years and several singles later, SOPHIE—long known to be the work of London-based producer Samuel Long—is now understood mostly in the context of <a href=""http://pcmusic.info/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PC Music</a>, a loose UK collective centered on producer <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/32520-a-g-cook/"">A. G. Cook</a> that recasts brazen commercialism as a kind of winking postmodern art project. <i>PRODUCT</i>, which collects the SOPHIE singles to date and adds some new songs, was released in limited-edition versions that packaged it with a jacket, sunglasses, and platform shoes, as well as a version sold with an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61411-sophie-releasing-singles-collection-with-silicon-product-that-sure-looks-like-a-sex-toy/"">object</a> that looked like a sex toy. When you take into account that bounty of merch, and add the fact that SOPHIE’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17009-sophie-lemonade/"">""Lemonade""</a> has in the last year been used to soundtrack <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60268-sophies-lemonade-featured-in-mcdonalds-ad/"">a McDonald’s commercial</a>, of all things, it’s clear that the act of buying and selling is deeply embedded within this project.</p>
<p>You might look at all this as a Warholian transformation of commerce into art or you might just see a run-of-the-mill cash-in, but neither of these perspectives adds much to the enduring brilliance of SOPHIE’s first pair of singles. Following on ""Bipp"" and ""Elle"", ""Lemonade"" intensifies the sound, like switching from a freshly squeezed glass of the titular drink to drinking Minute Maid concentrate right out of the cardboard can. Befitting music constructed at least in part as a critique of consumerism, SOPHIE’s tracks are gleaming and immaculate on the surface and hollow to the core beneath it. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17023-sophie-hard/"">""Hard""</a>’s chiming synths and rippling bass are again set against wide spaces of unnerving silence, a void where a deeper sense of meaning might be.</p>
<p>These tracks argue, often convincingly, that the surface is everything. It’s Turing Test pop: if its exterior catches your ear and makes you feel things, that communication is proof enough that some kind of soul resides inside the machine. The closing track here, ""Just Like We Never Said Goodbye"", shows this contrast in widescreen. It’s a melodic construction worthy of Max Martin, but the pitched-up voice, drum-free production, and generally half-finished feel highlight all the immediate pleasures of pop music while completely erasing the idea of a point of view. It’s so ""almost there"" you can’t help but play it over and over.</p>
<p>But SOPHIE is not, alas, an album-length proposition. Even at 26 minutes, the record drags, and the three song stretch of ""MSMSMSM"", ""Vyzee"", and ""L.O.V.E.""—that’s 38 cents of your album dollar—is depressingly skippable. These tracks either recycle bits from the earlier singles (chirpy vocals, squeaky percussion) or fold in new elements that sound mundane (trap percussion, doomy synths), leading to tracks that sound like they could have come from anybody. That these are the newer songs doesn’t help matters or bode particularly well for what might come next. And then there’s the fact that music this compressed and this syrupy is best heard in small doses, before your ear gets tired listening to it.</p>
<p>So the main problem with <i>PRODUCT</i>, ironically enough, is one of format. Every industrialist wanting to get his or her goods to the world knows that you have to package them properly. Heard individually and spaced many months apart, the best tracks here were diamond-hard realizations of very specific sonic ideas; placed on an album alongside songs that use similar ingredients but are markedly inferior, they rattle around in the can, perfect objects in search of the right container.</p></div>"|21212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21212-product/|6.6|Mark Richardson

In the broad array of vocal and synth samples, off-beat time signatures that varied from song to song, and even within the song itself, the conjunction of tens of ideas competing for dominance, you could hear a singular aesthetic being forged. One can imagine Jlin (Jerrilynn Patton) spent hours crafting the music in a way that spoke to her.</p>
<p>On her new EP, <i>Free Fall</i>, this same excitement is still at work, though not in a manner as excitingly weird as <i>Dark Energy</i>. <i>Dark Energy</i> was a record for the individual, feeling more at home for solo listening than in a club setting<i>. Free Fall</i> feels like a tribute to the sounds that brought her to where she is. It is critical that these tracks are gathered on a single EP; it's not that they don't have a place in her larger oeuvre, but they also feel distinctly familiar in a way that <i>Dark Energy</i> did not. But because Patton is still smarter than almost any of her peers, it means that <i>Free Fall</i> creates the kind of thrills that only she can provide. The EP builds to peaks that grip the heart in a joyful vice; the listener will feel both excited and overwhelmed and unsure which emotion to embrace over the other.</p>
<p>Certain songs elicit this feeling more than others. ""Eu4ria"", like the aptly named <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQcJEHKHRc0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Guantanamo""</a> from her debut, layers piercing screams and yells to create a horror-laden universe in three minutes. The track also sounds connected to <i>Dark Energy</i> closer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi-S54fuGyM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Abnormal Restriction""</a>, as definitive a statement about Patton's musical identity as you'll get. Populated with samples of Faye Dunaway's turn as Joan Crawford in <i>Mommie Dearest</i>, ""Abnormal Restriction"" added a blood-freezing exclamation point to the end of the album. ""Eu4ria"" is lighter; Patton sampled an iconic phrase from the original film version of Stephen King's <i>Carrie</i>. ""They're all gonna laugh at you,"" Carrie's mother yelled to her daughter in the film. Here, the phrase is interspersed in a frenetic beat that transforms it from a cry of anger and desperation to one of defiance.</p>
<p>""I Am the Queen"" and ""BuZilla"" are two biting pieces of footwork that don't let up and shouldn't. It's not the sometimes lovely structural sonics of classic Chicago South Side footwork. Instead, like the EP itself, the tracks push things into weirder realms of aural storytelling in a matter of minutes. ""BuZilla"" reuses the phrase ""live and let die."" The longer one listens to the track, the more it feels like a call that refuses to wait for a response. Whatever happens will happen. Patton will continue to create regardless. It's an aggressive and focused answer to her ""genre."" Whereas <i>Dark Energy</i> was fueled by a personal, cinematic vision of doom, <i>Free Fall</i> is an invigorating wash of sounds, a collection of ideas that meld together the past with Patton's present to form another hard-won and potent artistic statement.  </p></div>"|21302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21302-free-fall-ep/|7.6|Britt Julious

The three albums they've released since Michael Gira resurrected the project—2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14651-my-father-will-guide-me-up-a-rope-to-the-sky/""><i><span id=""docs-internal-guid-41e4b49f-5ebb-4c5d-fd0a-50b3f8e4875b"">My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky</span></i></a>, 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/""><i>The Seer</i></a>, and 2014's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19326-swans-to-be-kind/""><i>To Be Kind</i></a>—taken together with contemporaneous tours and live albums, all feel like variations upon a single theme, expressions of an essential Swans-ness.</p>
<p>For a while, though, they were the most mutable of bands. In a half-decade span beginning in the mid '80s, they swiftly transformed from bone-crushing no wave brutalists to God-fearing gothic rockers, and then to featherweight neo-folkies. <i>White Light from the Mouth of Infinity </i>and <i>Love of Life</i>, originally released in 1991 and 1992, respectively, marked the end of that metamorphosis, as the band settled into a sound at once songful and vast, luminous as a glass menagerie and forceful as a falling anvil.</p>
<p>The two albums have long been treated as minor works in Swans' discography: out of print for years, they were cherry-picked (alongside selections from 1989's major-label fiasco <i>The Burning World</i> and the Gira/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2168-jarboe/"">Jarboe</a> side project the World of Skin) for 1999's inauspiciously titled <i>Various Failures 1988-1992</i>. ""I'm ambivalent about much of it, but then what do I know????"" Gira <a href=""http://younggodrecords.com/collections/swans/products/various-failures"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has written</a> of the music on that anthology. ""Some of it is genuinely good I think. Anyway, I was learning (how to write a song) as I went.""</p>
<p>It's true that the period marked a shift from pummeling mantras to something more ""musical,"" with singing instead of shouting and cascading chords instead of just drop-tuned gut-punches. That said, even here, Gira's concept of ""songwriting"" remains idiosyncratic: there's little in the way of verse/chorus structures, mainly just mantra-like incantations and chords wreathed around gleaming pedal tones surrounded by wide-open expanse. Drummers Anton Fier (<i>White Light</i>) and Vincent Signorelli and Ted Parson (<i>Love of Life</i>) lay into their snares with military gusto, driving the music forward in surging tattoos, and their nonstop rattle contributes to a sensation of overwhelming excess. Close your eyes, and you can practically see the sounds exploding like fireworks against the darkness of your lids.</p>
<p>The textures and tone colors are well suited to Gira's favorite themes, like love, death, and the sublime. Where early Swans lyrics were notable largely for their grueling power dynamics and limitless abjection—see ""Raping a Slave"", ""Filth"", ""Cop"", etc.—here Gira explores a more nuanced perspective. It's hardly all kittens and rainbows; both albums are littered with ugliness, from the dirge-like ""Better Than You"" (""So glad I'm better than you,"" he sings, in the world's most dead-eyed Dear John letter) to the claustrophobic ""Amnesia"", where he tells us ""sex is a void filled with plastic"" and ""everything human's necessarily wrong."" Gira has rarely wallowed as beautifully as he does on ""Failure"", one of the great nadirs—in the best way possible—of the band's catalog. Over bluesy acoustic guitar and frigid digital synthesizers, his preacher's drawl drips like blood from a stone; it would be hard to imagine a voice with more gravitas. </p>
<p>But Gira has never met a dichotomy he could resist—he eats love and hate, sprinkled with a bit of good and evil, for breakfast—and here we can see the pendulum beginning to tip from darkness back to daylight. ""Her"" wraps clanging, <i>Children of God</i>-style thunderbolts around one of the tenderest love songs Gira has ever written, and ""Song for the Sun"", ""Love of Life"", and ""The Sound of Freedom"" all stretch their arms wide to embrace the limitless possibility of the universe, anticipating the way that love and spiritual ecstasy will return to the fore in the group's post-reunion work, particularly on 2014's <i>To Be Kind</i>.</p>
<p>A bonus disc accompanying the reissues is mostly anticlimax. It features a handful of alternate takes and mixes from both albums, along with a <i>Burning World</i>-era B-side, selections from the World of Skin's <i>Ten Songs for Another World</i>, and a few live songs from <i>Omniscience</i> and <i>Anonymous Bodies in an Empty Room</i>, plus another live cut, ""The Unknown"", that doesn't seem to have been released before but probably could have stayed that way. There's a fair amount of overlap with <i>Various Failures</i>, and the sequencing is haphazard, zigzagging from release to release without much rhyme or reason.</p>
<p>But it's never a bad thing to be reacquainted with Jarboe's harrowing rendition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSC25Ue8Gg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black Eyed Dog""</a>, and her a cappella rendering of ""Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes"", a centuries-old popular English song, is a welcome addition. (Both are from the World of Skin's 1990 album <i>Ten Songs for Another World</i>.) That the bonus disc leaves off ""God Damn the Sun"", <i>The Burning World</i>'s heartbroken highlight, seems like a missed opportunity. In fact, at this point, a full <i>Burning World </i>reissue (along, perhaps, with both the band's 1988 ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" covers) is long overdue, no matter how much Gira professes to regret making that album. Who knows, maybe he'll eventually come around. But for now, for anyone who wants to understand Swans' path from atonal self-flagellators to beatific supplicants of the sublime, these two reissues light the way, blindingly.</p></div>"|21259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21259-white-light-from-the-mouth-of-infinity-love-of-life/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Jeezy</a> occupies a similar ""veteran hardhead"" ground as Jadakiss at this point, ""Critical"" doesn't try to find common ground; instead, it's the kind of hyperactive hi-hat beat that predates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8916-lets-get-it-thug-motivation-101/""><i>Thug Motivation 101</i></a> with Jada on a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoMhU91MdzQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">double-time</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frIA7tuBqqY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dirty South</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XhzXB3oY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">flow</a> that interrupted <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJKx8oIySEs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""who's the best MC?""</a> discussions during the late 90s in New York.</p>
<p>Despite its street-level money, power and respect rhymes, almost all of it feels divorced from reality, free of any kind of narrative grounding or personal disclosure: ""you can call me Paul/ long as Peter pay,"" ""If you ain't in the circle, for a square I'll get you lined"" are typical punchlines that generate a smirk and disappear completely, mildly impressive feats of wordplay that only have meaning within the format's strictures. You might as well be watching Jadakiss solve crossword puzzles. </p>
<p>There are brief indications that <i>Top 5 Dead or Alive</i> was workshopped within the past three years. There's a track about smoking weed and, wouldn't you know, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a> is on it instead of Redman. The chorus of ""Jason"" gives brief mentions to Eric Garner and Ferguson. Otherwise, Jadakiss has to remind you of a time when ""top 5 dead or alive"" was something fans of mainstream rap actually discussed: ""Synergy"" is the requisite give-n-go tandem rap with Styles P and it's flagrantly modeled after ""We Gonna Make It"", right down to the cadence of the hook. Even if there isn't the requisite track here in the style of ""Why,"" Jada can't help but invoke its most infamous line (the one about Bush knocking down the towers). In the most desperate recall of his glory days, Jadakiss spits, ""you heard my name on the last verse of 'Ether,'"" which is technically true but feels like the equivalent of a boxing judge taking credit for Ali/Frazier.</p>
<p>Beyond muddled aims, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui4qYnVHjZ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">extremely confusing</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l0yxrrc-e0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tone-deaf skits</a> also seem to be a constant on Jadakiss projects. ""Ahaa Interview"" is a Madd Rapper-style Q&amp;A where a salty veteran claims he's going solo over his resentments towards Jadakiss. You'd swear this was a scorched-earth attack on Sheek Louch, except the guy shows up two tracks later. I mean, Puff Daddy is here too, so I guess he didn't take <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpZ7zuBzbIo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rape'n U Records""</a> skit to heart either. More importantly, a patron who sure sounds a lot like Busta Rhymes starts complaining about how heads don't check for ""bars"" anymore and now it's all about dancing and wearing blouses. You'd swear this was a diss against <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug"">Young Thug</a>, who's frankly been packing more inventive wordplay into a single verse these days than Jada does on the entirety of this ""rapper's rapper"" album. </p></div>"|21281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21281-top-5-dead-or-alive/|5.5|Ian Cohen

In terms of sharp-witted artists who led to the increasingly rare seismic belly laughs on the subway this year, she's up there with novelist Paul Beatty, whose 2015 book <i>The Sellout</i> sent up American politics and culture in a way that proves good satire can change your truth. Junglepussy's <i>Pregnant With Succes</i>s is another reminder of how humor can bring the audience closer and form an emotional connection. It's as bright as Beatty's novel is dark, but they're both charmingly demented, sharp-witted, and necessary social critiques. They remind me how humor can transform literature and music, forms that often aren't as empirically funny as film and television, bringing the audience closer and forming an emotional connection.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>She has a rare confidence that's rooted in playfulness: ""This pussy don't pop for you,"" she gloats on ""Pop For You"", a song with watery snares and a glitchy melody. The hook feels like she'</span><span>s playing a character, a parody of contemporary male rappers, </span><span>but it's more of a roast that has its roots on the surreal experience of being a woman in 2015. </span><span>It also riffs on the language of the oppressor, so to speak. </span><span>Junglepussy spits: ""You look up to these dudes to tell you who to screw/ What she'll look like if she your type/ Compliment her if she's light/ If she's black don't get her hype."" The joke comes at the end, when she compares a guy who takes her to the zoo versus one who buys her leopard print lingerie: ""I got niggas taking me to see live animals and you're pulling up with </span><i>animal prints</i><span>?""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's her perspective as a black woman, a regular woman, from New York City that makes this album transgressive. She raps as much about her voracious appetite as she does about fashion and sex. She references <i>Money and Violence</i> and haute Japanese eatery <a href=""http://www.noburestaurants.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nobu</a> over a series of glossy melodies and booming bass courtesy of producer <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/shybeats"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shy Guy</a>. She swiftly cycles through cadences that approximate the balloon-lunged bellowing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4944-ludacris/"">Ludacris</a> and a spiky <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10609-da-brat/"">Da Brat</a> flow. On ""Country Boy"", a song that feels like a nod to her Trinidadian and Jamaican roots, she channels Lady Saw's squawk and the grim commands of Buju Banton before issuing a whimsical sign-off: ""I be dutty winin' down the Yellow Brick Road!"" The beat on ""Get to Steppin'"" is the album's most aggressive: a synthetic Orientalist synth loop fights with battering bass and Junglepussy is in your face, exhorting you to step off whilst bigging herself up (""I was fuckin' with me when you wasn't""). It ends with a hilarious outro, a dorky jingle about online shopping and a rush of true swagger: ""When your Fendi boots come in the mail, time to front on everyone in here.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But mostly Junglepussy is pure idiosyncratic id; she is unapologetically crass (""If your face ain't a sitting place, fuck up out my face"") and freewheeling. </span><i>Pregnant With Success</i><span><i>'</i> appeal lies largely in hearing Junglepussy talk shit like one of the girls, with the aim of pulling apart the patriarchy as she experiences it. She uses humor, the voice curling with every joke, to replicate the situations and street corners of her own life. And when you're listening and laughing out loud on the subway, that's Junglepussy's smart truth-telling finding its way into yours.</span></p></div>"|21293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21293-pregnant-with-success/|7.5|Anupa Mistry

The producer was just 32, felled by a rare blood disease that clogged his body with clots and a case of lupus that caused his immune system to go haywire. Badu thought of a story Dilla's mother told her about her son's dying days, when she would find him having conversations with an unseen companion. One time, when she asked him who he was talking to, he said it was Ol' Dirty Bastard, who had died in 2004. As Badu <a href=""http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2013/02/when-erykah-met-dilla"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">recounted years later</span></a>, Dilla explained to his mom: “He was telling me what bus to get on when I cross over. He said, ‘Don’t get on the red bus, get on the white bus. The red bus looks fun, but that’s not the one.’” That memory inspired Badu to write a song called <a href=""https://youtu.be/Kht818X9wC0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Telephone""</a>, which starts: ""Telephone, it's Ol' Dirty/ He wants to give you directions home/ Said it won't be too long.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""Telephone"" originally appeared on Badu's 2008 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11562-new-amerykah-part-one-4th-world-war/""><i>New Amerykah Part One (4th World War)</i></a> and it's reprised in chopped-and-screwed form as a tribute to another late rap producer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/hall-of-game/9069-dj-screw/"">DJ Screw</a>, on the singer's new mixtape, <i>But You Caint Use My Phone</i>. For the 44-year-old ankh-worshipping R&amp;B iconoclast, phones aren't just emoji factories or Candy Crush receptacles—they're mystic devices that can span time and space, heaven and Earth. According to Badu, phones can enhance our ability to communicate deep desires across oceans, but they can also jumble our meaning with static or frustrate with busy signals and voicemail. As an extension of ourselves, phones can be heartbreaking, lustful, smart, dumb, noisy, distracting, powerful.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>But You Caint Use My Phone</i> is a mixtape in the true hip-hop sense, as it largely finds Badu putting her spin on other artists' songs. Created alongside a young producer and fellow Dallas denizen named <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/zachwitness"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zach Witness</a> in just 12 days, the tape feels off-the-cuff, yet also steeped in history and wisdom. This paradoxical quality can be found in much of Badu's work over the last two decades as well as on her initial inspiration for this tape, Drake's ""Hotline Bling"", the SoundCloud loosie-turned-smash about late-night buzzes with a beat taken from </span><span class=""s3"">Timmy Thomas' 1972 anti-war plea <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFU-FJzPE80"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Why Can't We Live Together""</a>. ""Hotline Bling"" is old and new, R&amp;B and hip-hop, serious and fun—it's a song that might not exist without the pioneering work of Erykah Badu, so it only makes sense for her to reclaim it.</span> </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">But rather than putting her stamp on a slew of 2015 hits, Badu reaches back across the last 40 years of phone-related pop, patching the Isley Brothers, Usher, Egyptian Lover, and New Edition through her own frequency. As a kid who grew up listening to her family's Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Chaka Khan records before falling in love with hip-hop in the '80s—her first concert was Run-D.M.C. and she began her musical career as a rapper known as MC Apples—Badu has always been ideally positioned between the reverence of classic soul and the irreverence of hip-hop. And on </span><span class=""s4""><i>But You Caint Use My Phone</i> she taps into her own language and influence along with everyone else's. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The title of the tape and its blaring opening suite reference her 1997 kiss-off <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjXWmuZ3ayc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tyrone""</a>, and the playful ""Dial’Afreaq"", a remake of the early electro-rap hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8ExpagNmg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dial-A-Freak""</a> by Uncle Jamm's Army and the Egyptian Lover, offers a brief history of Baduizm: ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CPCs7vVz6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'On &amp; On'</a> and <a href=""https://youtu.be/KUOZtKvqRmc?list=PLorbxqHG7IW5R24axOWEIst13YYmjiIg_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mama's Gun</i></a>/ Underwater ill motherfucker from the other sun."" Further referential depth comes courtesy of producer Witness, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGNQ7Ban6yo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a one-time child turntable prodigy</a> who was a toddler when Badu started her career. He first came to the singer's attention through his remix of ""On &amp; On"", and he melds his star's offbeat spontaneity and cosmic funk with a sleek SoundCloud-ready sheen. Another relatively unknown new artist Badu brought on for the project, rapper <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/sonusreps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ItsRoutine</a>, doesn't come off as well. His two Drake-impersonating verses (""Erykah on my hotline,"" he misdirects) are bizarrely, well, phoney—annoying prank calls on what should be a highly protected line.</span></p>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">Badu, a self-described ""analog girl in a digital world,"" has a clear fondness for old-school, pre-cell models with buttons that pushed and dials that turned. It's a nostalgic stance from someone who became famous a decade before the introduction of the iPhone, but it can also be convincing. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17816-erykah-badu-phone-down/"">""Phone Down""</a> has Badu pleading for someone to disconnect from the grid and plug into real life, but the track's sinister synths and her melancholy delivery suggest that she knows it's probably too late. </span></p>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">And yet. The mixtape's final track, a revamp of the Todd Rundgren/Isley Brothers '70s hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsezr0qiFIc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hello It's Me""</a>, features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/"">André 3000</a>—aka the father of Badu's only son, Seven—leaving his phone on the table in an effort to find some clarity, and it works. In the late '90s, Badu and Dre were a much-celebrated hip-hop couple, a model of black enlightenment and creativity. They broke up after a few years but remained close, and André famously apologized to Badu's mother on OutKast's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxAiK6VnXw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ms. Jackson""</a>, promising his commitment to fatherhood: ""Know that everything's cool/ And yes, I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation."" And as Seven turned 18 last month, his parents are still talking, still figuring things out, still collaborating on art. As their duet fades out here, both voices come together, and the conversation keeps going.</span></p></div>"|21319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21319-but-you-caint-use-my-phone/|8.1|Ryan Dombal

The music<span>—</span>an uptempo mixture of house music and hip-hop signifiers (GoldLink coined the term ""future bounce"" for it)<span>—</span>offset lyrics full of hypermasculine, purposefully exaggerated sexual boasts and street-savvy narratives. There was something indescribable about hearing the high-voiced rapper spit something like ""Dick to the face, might choke"" 0ver bubbly champagne synths, and the tape caught on, along with its signature hit ""Ay Ay"". The Washington, D.C. rapper toured alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30111-mac-miller/"">Mac Miller</a>, as well as electronic producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28873-sbtrkt/"">SBTRKT</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31672-kaytranada/"">Kaytranada</a>. He even caught the attention of Def Jam founder/music visionary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6945-rick-rubin/"">Rick Rubin</a>, who has served as a mentor for his debut album, <i>And After That, We Didn't Talk</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>And After That, We Didn't Talk</i> is not a significant sonic departure from Link's previous work, but it carries more thematic weight. The album concerns a relationship and subsequent breakup he had when he was 16, but telling a six-year-old story also leaves the door open for very selective memory. The woman in question remains nameless throughout the album, and though he freely talks about a ""Que"" (with whom she was cheating on Link), an ""Allan"" (a likely previous boyfriend), and sprinkles other biographical notes, the bigger picture of <i>why</i> this moment and this person matter so much to Link that he dedicated his first studio album to her is often missing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Instead, <i>And After That</i> communicates GoldLink's state of mind. He is reflective on the opening track, ""After You Left"", hopeful on ""Zipporah"", with its gospel chant bridge, ""Lord, Lord, I need your help, Lord."" The following three songs (""Dark Skin Women"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17753-goldlink-spectrum/"">""Spectrum""</a>, and ""Dance on Me"") best encapsulate his hip-hop/dance hybrid sound, and find Link returning to the sexual braggadocio of <i>The God Complex</i>, which is often where he finds the most joy as a writer (listen to his <i>very</i> vivid description of cunnilingus on ""Dance on Me"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Toward the album's end, Link ventures into R&amp;B and, at times, completely abandons rapping. He sings about his obsessive love on ""Palm Trees"", and while it's still unclear </span><span>why</span><span> he's obsessed, his pained vocals make you believe. The same emotion comes through on ""Polarized"" when he sings, ""Go down South to Atlanta with your sister and/ I'll fly you myself, if I have to."" In that song, all we learn about the subject is that she's a 5'7"" model, but Link is convincing enough as a communicator to make up for the lyrical gaps.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>And </i><i>After That, We Didn't Talk</i></span><span> is not quite as immediately exciting as its predecessor, which was a burst of aphrodisiac energy. GoldLink feels tugged down occasionally by the story he is trying to tell. As he said in an </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9735-a-matter-of-mentors-in-the-studio-with-goldlink-and-rick-rubin/""><span>interview with Pitchfork</span></a><span>, ""I feel like 99% of niggas lie in they raps; I don't."" The literal truths, however, distract from <i>how</i> he expresses them. GoldLink is a total-package artist, someone who does not have to rely entirely on facts to succeed as a rapper. His music works when every element blends together, and <i>And After That, We Didn't Talk</i> is most interesting when he shares only the most vital details from a moment. It's then that he can wring his experiences for their emotions and convey feelings with more than just words.</span></p></div>"|21209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21209-and-after-that-we-didnt-talk/|7.3|Matthew Strauss

We do know that he's a childhood friend of label head <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32520-a-g-cook/"">A. G. Cook</a> (with whom he performs in Dux Content), a classically trained composer, and seems to have played a foundational role in defining the PC Music aesthetic. And yet, he's only released a few solo tracks since the label's emergence—he might be the least prolific SoundCloud phenom this side of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28714-jai-paul/"">Jai Paul</a>.</p>
<p>Anticipation for new music from Harle is understandably high, a fact that clearly hasn't been lost on PC Music. The <i>Broken Flowers </i>EP marks PC Music's inaugural joint release with Columbia Records, the first shot fired in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pcmus/photos/a.599675716720842.1073741828.596179120403835/1036179919737084/?type=3&amp;permPage=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">what the label has described as</a>, ""[a] multi-tier attack exposing the radical DNA of chart music, and the heart and soul behind every lab creation."" Clocking in at 4 songs and just under 15 minutes, the <i>Broken Flowers </i>EP is a focused, purposeful release, clearly meant to introduce the PC Music sound to new listeners and commercial heights.</p>
<p>The EP is bookended by the titular single—closing track ""Awake for Hours"" is really just a remix of ""Broken Flowers"" that speeds up the original to a breakneck pace. Luckily, ""Broken Flowers"" is still a thrilling listen two years on. This is the closest thing the label has to a deep-house cut, a song that would feel at home on almost any dancefloor despite its winkingly maudlin lyrics. The track builds with impressive precision, with sinuous arpeggios, marimba notes, and reverberating vocal samples clicking into place atop a driving 4/4 beat. What's more, it sounds as if Harle has rebuilt the song from scratch for this release; where the original reveled in cliché house sounds, every element in this mix, including the vocals, feels cleaned up and refined.</p>
<p>The two new songs, ""Forever"" and ""Without You"", don't disappoint, even as they diverge from the template Harle sketched out on ""Broken Flowers"". Both tracks hew much closer to the PC Music playbook, with chirpy, pitched up vocals sitting atop glistening, Technicolor synths. ""Without You"" is a clear standout, surfacing the melancholic undercurrent that gave ""Broken Flowers"" its depth. Vocalist Emily Verlander pines for a lover over an airy track that heaves and sighs, exploring the tension between helium-inhaling vocals and confessional lyrics. The implication here is unclear—we're either being invited to dismiss the heartbroken pop song as naive or confront the infantilization of female narrators in pop. Harle's role as the male auteur behind the curtain further complicates our understanding, lending the song the sort of discomfiting air that's become a PC Music trademark.</p>
<p>As compelling as the music on the <i>Broken Flowers </i>EP is, calling it an EP feels like a bit of stretch—it's really just a single, one that's anchored by a remake of a track that's been out for two years. Then again, it's hard to blame Harle and PC Music for playing it safe given the stakes here. At the core of PC Music's agenda lies a desire to simultaneously critique and embrace chart pop by mimicking its form; what better way to signal the fulfillment of the label's ambitions than with an <i>actual charting pop single</i>? ""Sometimes I feel, maybe/ This could be real,"" Verlander admits on ""Without You"".

For most listeners, it was a song about the emotional breakthrough of a woman finally confronting her unfaithful partner. But its production, with looped strings, piano, and hand drum, was startling to deep soul fans. ""Window Shades"" incorporated a licensed sample of Gloria Ann Taylor's 1973 single, ""Love Is a Hurting Thing"", a song found on a privately-pressed 12"" called <i>Deep Inside You</i> featured one of the more <a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/user/poppa_shig/media/DSCF2666.jpg.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">anonymous spirograph sleeves from that era</a>. Seen in the racks, the 12"" might have looked like any number of local gospel or marching band albums from the mid-'70s, but this one came with a twist: a copy of the release, credited to Gloria Ann Taylor and Walt Whisenhunt's Orchestra, routinely tops <a href=""http://www.popsike.com/php/quicksearch.php?searchtext=gloria+ann+taylor&amp;thumbs=&amp;currsel=&amp;sortord=&amp;endfrom=&amp;endthru=&amp;ipp=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">four figures in online auctions</a>, making it one of the most coveted soul/disco albums of its ilk.</p>
<p><i>Deep Inside You</i> is the centerpiece of <i>Love Is a Hurtin' Thing</i>, <a href=""http://www.ubiquityrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ubiquity</a>'s long-gestating compilation of highlights from Gloria Taylor's brief career, gathering five singles recorded between 1971 and 1977. For those of more modest means who've relied on mp3s culled from long-deleted music blogs, <i>Hurtin' Thing</i> fills in her discography as well as her biography. The mystery inherent in her music has led to some strange speculations online. Even her Discogs page puts her birthplace as Alabama, saying that she formed gospel group Sweet Honey in the Rock and passed away 10 years ago (no doubt conflating her with one Gloria Ann Taylor-James). As these liner notes clarify, though, Taylor was actually born in a coal-mining town in West Virginia and is still very much with us.</p>
<p>That Gloria Ann Taylor didn't become a household name isn't of much concern now. It's difficult to become a star, much easier to be star-crossed, to find your music lost to time. So the fact that she never made it is not cosmic injustice so much as the actual indifference of the universe. It was in fact at the start of Taylor's career as a soul singer based in Toledo that she had her best shot at stardom. Compared favorably to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"">Aretha Franklin</a>, she had a powerful, church-bred voice that caught the attention of one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a>'s arrangers and associates, Walt Whisenhunt, fresh off of working on Doris Troy's ""Just One Look"". They became both musical partners and a couple.</p>
<p>The number of forgotten, obscure, or lost soul singers revived in the 21st century runs long and deep, the ""personal sacrifice, failed relationships, and missed opportunity"" that these notes describe are all attendant of this peculiar genre. But before allowing hard-knock biography to color the reception of <i>Love Is a Hurtin' Thing</i>, just listen to the opening seconds of the title track. A blistering psychedelic guitar solo, like something left off of <i>Nuggets</i>, flares across the opening 10 seconds, but 20 seconds in, we're awash in opulent strings, piano, and Taylor's voice, a powerful instrument that seem to be echoing from a subterranean tunnel.</p>
<p>As production choices for a potential hit single in the early 1970s go, it's baffling, one part psych-rock, one part Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra, all competing with the fresh wound of Taylor's voice. There's a raw pain and cavernous hurt in Taylor's every exhalation, the lyrics questioning how love could bring such joy and pain. And the music itself is bent on evoking all of the ecstasy and agony, the crazed jags of adoration and confusion that stems from a dysfunctional relationship.</p>
<p>""How Can You Say It"" has Taylor talk about giving her lover her last dime, then finding tears on his pillow. That wrenching whiplash of emotions are scored by lush orchestration and percussion swaddled in so much echo so as to suggest the sound <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"">Lee Perry</a> would get out of the Black Ark in a few years' time. Same goes for ""Deep Inside of You"", where the strings, vibraphone, and Taylor's voice are all doused in heavy reverb, and for an instant, everything becomes disorienting and indistinct.</p>
<p>No other soul producer in that era would smother their vocalist in so many effects or arrange backing harmonies at such cross purposes to the main melody. So while Taylor voices heartbreak and anguish, Whisenhunt's idiosyncratic productions suggest something close to madness. But his choices—which no doubt made mainstream success impossible—are staggering 40 years on. On the haunting dirge of ""Burning Eyes"", Taylor's voice frays before our ears, shadowed by a muted trumpet and a horn section that seems to have lurched up from a graveyard. ""World That's Not Real"" is ominous yet ephemeral, buoyed by xylophone and Taylor's desolate voice. Almost a minute in, the piano hits a chord that Oliver Wang at Soul-Sides once deemed ""Death's ringtone,"" yet at that, the song briefly brightens, only to sidle back into darkness, perching at the edge of the void.</p>
<p>Harrowing and feverish as these sides are, the most uncanny song remains the seven-minute version of ""Love Is a Hurtin' Thing"", a befuddling megamix comprised of the original version of the track as well as chunks of previous singles ""How Can You Say It"" and ""Music"", all cobbled together in the studio by Whisenhunt. To the mix he adds more stinging wah-wah guitar, silken orchestration, and a re-recorded drum track not quite in sync with the original that trainwrecks the whole thing (no doubt an attempt to cash in on disco fever). With funds low, it had a minuscule press run and was soon forgotten. Yet somehow, it all works. It's glorious and bewildering, magnificent and forlorn, defiant and defeated, an emotional speedball. Heard in 2015, the music is as indelible and inscrutable as ever. Or, as Taylor once sang about love: ""It's a mystery no one can explain.""</p></div>"|21269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21269-love-is-a-hurtin-thing/|8.7|Andy Beta

She <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9664-jenny-hvals-soft-dick-rock/"">explained</a> to Pitchfork that part of this idea—an inverse of hyper-masculine cock rock—stemmed from her watching the two-part, three-hour <i>History of the Eagles</i> documentary.</p>
<p>Like Hval, ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni Bill Hader and Fred Armisen found something to ponder with <i>History of the Eagles</i>. On a two-episode chunk of their new parody series ""Documentary Now!""<i>,</i> they paid tribute to the same expansive documentary that inspired Hval. But instead of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22835-eagles/"">the Eagles</a>, Armisen and Hader focused on the fictitious Blue Jean Committee. What started out as fake has become fact with the Blue Jean Committee’s new EP, <i>Catalina Breeze</i>. The duo don't just lend their faces to the band: they wrote and recorded all these songs themselves, too—Armisen has a long history as a drummer, and is currently the bandleader on ""The Late Show with Seth Myers"",<i> </i>his ""Documentary Now!""<i> </i>co-creator and ""SNL"" cohort.</p>
<p><i>Catalina Breeze</i> barely passes the 10-minute mark through seven songs, but even in its brevity, Hader and Armisen manage to hit every hallmark of the California band they sought to be in ""Documentary Now!"". The opening title track offers the most complete portrait of the Blue Jean Committee: keys mix with bongos and a swishy percussion section, while the repeating chorus of ""Catalina breeze, Catalina"" is just as breezy as you’d hope. It feels so comfortable and familiar that, for a minute, it feels like it’s not just funny business after all. Later, ""Gentle and Soft"" arrives as a harmony-heavy acoustic ballad adorned with an occasional twinkling chime.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on <i>Catalina Breeze</i>, it feels like the Blue Jean Committee is trying to hit as many '70s songwriting themes as they can in as little time as possible. ""Going Out to Hollywood"" follows the trope of a narrative of a small-town diner waitress who’s got bigger dreams than her home can accommodate, while ""Mr. Fix It"" directly recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1427-electric-light-orchestra/"">ELO</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjPqsDU0j2I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mr. Blue Sky""</a> in its jumpy, earnest appeal to a powerful cosmic figure. The band throws the slightest bit of funk into the mix with ""Mama You’re a Dancer"", and ""Walking Shoes"" mimics the not-so-Southern rock peddled by the likes of the Doobie Brothers with a banjo hiding under peppy guitar licks.</p>
<p>All of this is enjoyable for music nerds, who get to pick out the embedded inspirations and influences. But ultimately<i> Catalina Breeze </i>is an impressive, if perhaps not entirely necessary, follow-through on a joke. It wasn’t enough for these songs to exist on TV; they had to get cut to vinyl and put out through <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a>, as well. <i>Catalina Breeze </i>makes for a fun exercise, but as a standalone release, it’s a little, well, soft. </p></div>"|21304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21304-catalina-breeze/|6.7|Allison Hussey

Sure, a select number of unearthed B-sides and overdue reissues reward the effort, but there's a whole swath of mediocre cover records destined to linger in the leftovers bin. So many of them read as easy cash grabs—not at all essential unless you're a superfan (because really, those are the only people clamoring to own the Foo Fighters' version of ""Kids in America""). In 2011, Ty Segall offered an exception to that rule, releasing a covers EP that was worth buying <i>and</i> quietly stood as one of the best entries in his lengthy discography. Just that name alone, <i>Ty Rex</i>, was exciting—the promise that Segall at the top of his game would record a series of Marc Bolan covers. Now, the entire <i>Ty Rex</i> oeuvre is being issued in full (the original EP, its 2013 follow-up 7"", and an unreleased bonus track). It's a good thing, too, because these covers demand a bigger audience.</p>
<p><i>Ty Rex </i>arrived two months before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/""><i>Goodbye Bread</i></a>, his most paced and subdued statement up to that point. He'd been touring behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14347-melted/""><i>Melted</i></a>'s giant-hook singles (""Girlfriend"", ""Imaginary Person"", etc.), and he'd become <i>very good</i> at performing covers. His live sets usually featured his wide-eyed versions of hard rock staples (by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m_WKK5YlWY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sabbath</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh2eMU5oR_Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AC/DC</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjGThj7JePU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Motörhead</a>, to name a few). His 2010 Daytrotter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12071-dont-talk-to-me-gg-allin-cover/"">recording of G.G. Allin's ""Don't Talk to Me""</a> was an unhinged star turn. The expected move was for him to bring that same chaos to <i>Ty Rex</i>. But this time around, lizard-brained Segall took a step back. Instead, he showed restraint, recording an aesthetic stepping stone between the fuzz pop fury of <i>Melted</i> and the comparative lethargy of <i>Goodbye Bread</i>.</p>
<p>He didn't just run through the hits, either. It opens with ""Fist Heart Mighty Dawn Dart"", which appeared on the 1970 Tyrannosaurus Rex album <i>Beard of Stars.</i> Segall slows and steadies the pace, subbing out Micky Finn's Moroccan clay drums for the traditional rock'n'roll kit, and the vocal melody is smoothed out from Bolan's stilted chorus. Segall's groove is even more gradual on his reading of the 1968 track ""Salamanda Palaganda"", and the restraint gives every whimsical image—the old crones, the night eagles—the opportunity to fully sink in.</p>
<p>There's a posthumously released T. Rex record called <i>Rabbit Fighter: The Alternate Slider</i>, which features demos and acoustic versions of <i>Slider </i>songs. It's Bolan at his most restrained and pared back—proof that his songs were already gold before he slathered on the extra gilding (string sections, layered electric guitar solos, and so on). <i>Ty Rex </i>is also an album-length acknowledgment of Bolan's core strengths. Throughout, Segall plays it straight—the solos are never excessively flashy (sticking close to the originals) and the recording quality is slightly muffled. He never attempts a Bolan impression, either, and he largely forgoes any untethered <i>Slaughterhouse </i>wildness to play up Bolan's melodies, chord progressions, and absurd lyrics. He knows that you don't rewrite Shakespeare, and you don't attempt to outswagger one of rock'n'roll history's most confident heartthrobs.</p>
<p>Of course, it's a Ty Segall record, so he still brings some of that fire. His previously unreleased version of ""20th Century Boy"" is <i>Ty Rex</i> at its most fuzzy and abrasive, packing the record's most impressive, sky-high guitar solo. But every pound of rock'n'roll aggression is tempered by more withdrawn performances, like the slow burn of ""The Motivator"", ""Cat Black"", and ""The Slider"". That's what the best T. Rex records are like, too—for every ""Rip Off"", there a ""Girl"". </p>
<p>Clearly, Segall could do more than one installment of <i>Ty Rex</i>. During his Ty Rex set at Gonerfest 12, people went nuts at just the <i>suggestion</i> of ""Bang a Gong"". There are several reasons why Segall is well-suited to this material—he's a guitar hero and his voice is in exactly the right register. He's an excellent showman and a rock'n'roll screamer, but he can also emote behind his acoustic guitar. With his thoughtful, deft, and exciting performances, Segall also clearly has a reverence for these songs. As Segall works through Bolan's discography—from the early acoustic stuff to the big tent T. Rex singles—he's offering a convincing invitation to deep dive into Bolan's discography. </p></div>"|21295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21295-ty-rex/|8.1|Evan Minsker

While the star-studded travelogue <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19864-foo-fighters-sonic-highways/""><i>Sonic Highways</i></a> promised <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-z8A9P5ziA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""a musical map of America""</a>, it could've passed for a longform Hard Rock Café commercial, ignoring basically every genre outside of the blues-rock lineage. The featherweight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17810-dave-grohl-sound-city-ost/""><i>Sound City: Reel to Reel</i></a> documentary and soundtrack was similarly amicable, but it happened to conflate rock 'n roll's ""human element"" with the Neve console, a machine costing somewhere between <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2013/03/08/173823162/dave-grohl-finds-musics-human-element-in-a-machine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">$78,000 and $1 million</a>. </p>
<p>The same unintended gap in perspective between Grohl's aw-shucks persona and his output defines <i>Saint Cecilia</i>, a free EP dropped right before Thanksgiving. In the <a href=""http://www.saintceciliaep.com/#"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">virtual liner notes</a>, Grohl gushes over its recording process, telling of good friends digging through old riffs and creating new jams, wasted away in Margaritaville. The results still sound as slickly produced and hedge-betting as any actual <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"">Foo Fighters</a> album.</p>
<p>As well they should<span>—</span>when Dave Grohl and his friends want to record over a lost week(end), this means having Austin's St. Cecilia Hotel turned into a recording studio within the matter of hours, while Gary Clark Jr., Jack Black and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band jam in the periphery. There are expensive microphones and professional recording engineers and famous photographers namedropped like high school buddies. If you really want to hear Foo Fighters songs in chrysalis, by all means, find a bootlegged copy of<a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Late-Pocketwatch/release/1542262"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> Pocketwatch</i></a>.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <i>St. Cecilia</i>'s title track arrives already sounding like it's made the rounds on whatever's left of your local rock radio station. It's the most immediately pleasing thing they've done this decade and also the most instantly familiar, with a robust chorus built on a progression of straight-strummed barre chords, stacked harmonies and broad lyrics that express a general sense of yearning, but nothing that puts Grohl's personal life on the spot. In other words, it's not terribly different than ""Learn to Fly"" or ""Times Like These"" or ""Next Year"", proof that Foo Fighters are modern day, power-pop workhorses in their natural state rather than a <i>rawk</i> band.</p>
<p>Whenever that reputation threatens to stick, Grohl always draws on a Northern Virginia upbringing that put him within driving distance of DC's hardcore scene. ""Sean"" and ""Savior Breath"" are punk Foo Fighters, or as punk as they can sound in 2015<span>—</span>infinitely more energetic than anything on <i>Sonic Highways</i>, but only incrementally edgier, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15328-wasting-light/""><i>Wasting Light</i></a> without Butch Vig's glossy overlay.</p>
<p>Foo Fighters couldn't make a truly sloppy, abrasive or hookless song if they tried, and they're certainly not going to. With every album prepping the inevitable <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits"">Foo Fighters' Greatest Hits</a>, Vol. 2</i>, Grohl gets closer to actualizing his unstated goal of being this generation's Tom Petty, a real deal, aw-shucks everydude churning out one centrist and likeable rock song after another. Just look at Grohl's personal trajectory: After <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6161-kurt-cobain/"">Kurt Cobain</a>'s suicide, he made the painful decision to turn down his hero's offer to play drums on tour with the Heartbreakers (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhYOdsqK5Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Saturday Night Live</i> had to do</a>) and Foo Fighters have recently added ""Breakdown"" as a staple in their live sets. </p>
<p>But even if Grohl's vocals are as immediately identifiable as Petty's by now, he is further than ever from having a distinct <i>voice;</i> Foo Fighters remain our most unknowable and emotionally blank rock stars. Grohl's hooks are wide enough to catch any feeling,<span>—</span>""Things are gonna go, no matter what I say/Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say""; ""Who you runnin' from?""; ""No one lets everyone in."" Foo Fighters <i>are</i> a power-pop band in this sense. But amidst the plodding alt-roots of ""Iron Rooster"", Grohl's genial recriminations (""Have you ever been young enough to feel what you wanted to feel/ Take back those years for something real"") are best pointed back at him; as well as being their most diverse, hooky and unpredictable records, <i>Foo Fighters</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10473-the-colour-and-the-shape-10th-anniversary-special-edition""><i>The Colour and the Shape</i></a> were the only ones where you could trace Grohl's lyrics to some kind of source and there was still some question as to what he wanted this band to be.</p>
<p>Even at their exalted status, Foo Fighters are not an institution like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"">U2</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>; unlike those bands, there's never any debate or even <i>discussion</i> surrounding their next artistic move. If you consider Grohl in a rock 'n' roll CEO role, like Dan Auerbach or Jack White, it only draws attention to how perverse and prickly Auerbach and White  seem in comparison. But for as much effort as it takes to love Foo Fighters, it's nearly impossible to dislike them. Read Grohl's letter again and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32223-beach-slang"">Beach Slang</a> can seem kinda wishy-washy about rock music, leaving no doubt that making <i>Saint Cecilia </i>was clearly a rejuvenating experience for Foo Fighters. The EP itself is less convincing as evidence.</p></div>"|21315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21315-foo-fighters-saint-cecilia-ep/|6.0|Ian Cohen

Johnson's presence carried weight.<b> </b>Beat Happening toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a> and were covered by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seaweed</a>. <span>Kurt Cobain got a tattoo of the K Records logo.</span> There was an edge to this music, and it’s still there. </p>
<p>Beat Happening's lyrics, which included images of hand-holding and hot chocolate, scan as innocent, but the guy in ""Hot Chocolate Boy"" got his name because he’s ""deep sweet and bitter,"" watching TV alone and wishing he had a girlfriend. The songs are populated with zombies, witches, blood sucking. Even on their most famous song, ""Indian Summer"", with its idyllic sense of longing, they are eating their breakfast of apples and cherry blossoms in a cemetery. </p>
<p>History is never complete, which is why compilations like <i>Look Around</i> are helpful. Easy downloads and streaming can definitely bring into question the need for compilations—why buy a collection of previously released songs when you can find most of them online? But what you’re paying for—or at least scanning the track list for—is the curation. The 23-song <i>Look Around</i> is perfect in that regard. There will always be favorites missing—it’s the nature of compilations—but there are no major oversights or head-scratching inclusions here. It’s a great primer for new Beat Happening fans, and as it turns out, an excellent reminder for those of us who’d kind of forgotten about them. The songs are presented in chronological order, so it feels like a distilled time capsule, and it offers a chance to watch patterns emerge and themes continue in time-lapse.</p>
<p>It’s not the first compilation to focus on the band. There was the now out-of-print 7xCD <i>Crashing Through</i> box set contained all their albums, plus some rarities. The 15-song <i>Music to </i><i>Climb the Apple Tree By</i>, which focused on <i>just</i> B-sides, felt a bit thin. Here we get a taste of each era. The selections are pretty evenly distributed, with a few songs from 1985’s self-titled debut (the one with the cartoon cat driving a rocket ship on the cover), 1988’s <i>Jamboree</i> (featuring a drawing of a heart-shaped strawberry), 1989’s <i>Black Candy</i> (a simple drawing of black candy), 1991’s <i>Dreamy</i> (the only album featuring the band on the cover), and 1992’s <i>You Turn Me On</i> (which featured a tasteful artistic nude). They’ve also appended 2000’s ""Angel Gone"", from a single produced by Phil Elverum (the B-side, ""Zombie Limbo Time"", appeared on <i>Music to Climb the Apple Tree By</i>). These songs still sound fresh. Maybe because the arrangements are so basic and stripped down, without any overzealous studio tricks or instrumentation that ties it to a particular year, they feel timeless. Or, more accurately, out of time. I think the emotion is important, too, because these lyrics focus on simple human situations most of us have probably experienced.</p>
<p>For a lot of people, 1991’s International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia, a six-day festival organized by Johnson and his K co-founder Candice Pedersen that featured performances from Fugazi, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"">Bikini Kill</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"">Built to Spill</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4427-unwound/"">Unwound</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2399-l7/"">L7</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/459-bratmobile/"">Bratmobile</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2726-mecca-normal/"">Mecca Normal</a>, and others, made more sense, and had more of a mythology to it, than <i>Nevermind</i>, which first hit later that same year. Beat Happening and their cohorts represented a part of the Pacific Northwest scene that was less interested in playing bigger venues or making it on MTV.</p>
<p>And this still matters now, in part, because 30 years after the release of their debut, there’s a lot of music that hearkens to the band and the K scene they helped spearhead. You can hear them in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32493-girlpool/"">Girlpool</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31974-frankie-cosmos/"">Frankie Cosmos</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32659-quarterbacks/"">Quarterbacks</a>, and in other bands who release a couple of songs and then disappear. You’ll hear them name-dropped in interviews by artists like Carrie Brownstein. This collection contains many of their best and most memorable songs, but their real legacy is found in basement venues and DIY spaces and groups just learning how to play but not being afraid to do so in public.</p></div>"|21245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21245-look-around/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

The record’s title and some of its window dressings gesture at Jupiter’s movements, but the artists find themselves planted firmly in the Twin Cities streets they’ve defined and documented over the past two decades.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Muja made a name for himself in the early 2000s with a string of show-stealing guest verses, before his solo LPs—like last year’s <i>God Kissed It, the Devil Missed It</i>—solidified him as the Cities’ sneering id. (He’s also written verses for several of your favorite yacht-owning rappers.) I Self Devine’s legacy stretches back even further: together with DJ Kool Akiem as the Micranots, he was one of the first genuine Minneapolis stars, to the point where his nod helped solidify Rhymesayers in its infancy.</p>
<p>Rapping together for the first time at length, it’s quickly apparent that Muja and Chaka invert the old duo dynamics. The two MCs still present the point and counter-point on a single theme, but where the variance in many a group setting has come from each rapper’s writing, it’s evident on <i>9th House</i> mostly in the tone of the vocals. Self is gruff, guttural, and earnest, and Muja’s voice is the audio equivalent of that .gif where Birdman rubs his hands together in front of doves and an explosion.</p>
<p>That’s seen most clearly on ""Arrow Dynamics"": Muja’s ""Diagnosed: ADHD/ For white folks, that’s a disability"" and Self’s ""Well-dressed niggas get hit, like, ‘Where the product at?’/ White trash pulling dime sacks out their Prada bags"" complement each other, while in more similar hands they might combine to be too on-the-nose. The song’s hook, though, converges at the group’s de facto mission statement: ""Gun up on my hip, I won’t bust it at my nigs/ But I guarantee I’m shooting at the cops, though."" It’s clear, and it’s potent.</p>
<p>And it’s morbidly prescient: On November 15th, a Minneapolis police officer shot and killed a 24-year-old black man named Jamar Clark. Multiple eyewitnesses say Clark was handcuffed when the fatal shot was fired; police deny that he had been handcuffed, but have yet to release video of the incident. Protesters reacted swiftly, shutting down the I-94 freeway and, more recently, occupying the 4th Precinct in North Minneapolis. It was there that five protesters were shot, apparently by a small group of white supremacists. (No one was critically injured.) The following night, more shots were fired at those assembled. At the time of this writing, hundreds of people remain in the blocks surrounding the precinct, and thousands have marched through downtown Minneapolis demonstrating against Clark’s killing, the absence of video evidence, and the police response to the subsequent shootings.</p>
<p>Muja has even inserted himself into the protests, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZl-Y0x2acM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">demanding answers</a> in Mayor Betsy Hodges’ foyer and <a href=""https://twitter.com/mujamessiah/status/667460567293104128"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clarifying</a> that he’s a “concerned citizen” unaffiliated with any political movement. That sounds about right: <i>9th House</i> is mostly an act of collage, with pro-black, anti-police sentiments dominating its most lucid moments. There’s malt liquor, gold slippers, and promises to ""suplex label reps,"" but when the MCs cut through, they do it with a knife that’s carefully pointed. On ""IOFWUCUC"" (an acronym for ""I Only Fuck With You ‘Cause You Crazy""), Self raps, ""Dreaming of peace and violence/ Don’t wanna be a martyr/ Defiance in my blood running as clear as water."" For two men who would seemingly expect their closest confidants to read between the lines, some anxieties are made refreshingly clear.</p>
<p>The most striking part of <i>9th House</i>, perhaps even more than its politics, is how it's equal parts loose and specific to its environment. The former quality is thanks to beats from J.Hard, M¥K, and Orko Eloheim, the latter to the Holiday Inn on Eleventh Street and Rashad McCants. In an unsettling time for Minneapolis-St. Paul, <i>9th House</i> is the record the Cities have created for themselves.</p></div>"|21320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21320-9th-house/|7.3|Paul A.

The UK top 100 for 1989 boasts the likes of Inner City's ""Good Life"", Lil Louis's ""French Kiss"", and British early adopter A Guy Called Gerald's ""Voodoo Ray"" while the U.S. charts bear out that we all but ignored our homegrown sound (though we charted Marshall Jefferson's “Move Your Body” as blanched by the Belgian act Technotronic as ""Pump up the Jam""). No historian or music critic would ever categorize 1989 as Chicago's ""second summer of love"".</p>
<p>Beginning in 2007, singles began emanating from a British label and act known as Paranoid London. The duo of Gerardo Delgado and Quinn Whalley, flashed an unfettered enthusiasm for<span>—</span>and emulation of<span>—</span>the mad whinnying frequencies of the 303, but coupled it to an ethos that in the 21st century might more closely align with punk. They didn't do any press, didn't promo their music, didn't upload mixes to Soundcloud to build buzz, and when they released their debut album at the end of December 2014, there was no digital version. While the group were much discussed in Europe and the UK, there was nary a ripple nor mention made stateside.</p>
<p>A year on, the ten track album is now readily available digitally and on CD. For an electronic music culture increasingly bloated, glitzy, and insufferable, Paranoid London is a refreshing punch to the nuts. The tracks that Delgado and Whalley craft are simple as a prison shiv, not adding layers of gloss or paint to its acid-house, but stripping it back to its basics. Almost every track is erected from the same blocks: handclaps bright as tin foil, dry snares, sharp hi-hats, concussive kicks, all of it buoyed by queasy undulations of bass. They emulate <a href=""%5Bhttp://www.globaldarkness.com/articles/trax_records_chicago_acid.htm"">Trax</a> and those shoddy, shady days of Chicago pressings to the point that you expect a chunk of rubber to be embedded in the records themselves. </p>
<p>There are spot-on acid house bangers like ""Headtrack"" and ""Paris Dub 3"" that evoke peak Junior Boy's Own releases as well as late-'80s Chicago. On the latter, the duo collaborate with Paris Brightledge, a vocalist on early tracks by Sterling Void and Joe Smooth. The coup de grace is the deadpan intonation of Mutato Pintado; on the wet cardboard thud of ""Transmission 5"", he switches out words that range from the inane to the lurid: ""skin on my shoes...feeling good...lipstick...hair in my hand...late night..."" and at one point, he croons about ""playing by the rules"" then suppresses a small chuckle. </p>
<p>Playing by the rules of making classic acid house while also laughing at them, setting up expectations and then undercutting them: It's what Paranoid London does best. “Lovin U (Ahh Shit)” is a love song but the title sends mixed signals, approximating the cross purposes of hook-up culture. ""You've got the green light/ right past the stop sign"" DJ Genesis sings in her monotone, juxtaposing ""forever loving you/ just a little bit."" Its sentimental in a way that works with the group’s decidedly cheeky unsentimental manner.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer I got to see Paranoid London play live as part of Amsterdam’s Dekmantel festival. They were sandwiched between two legends: DJ Harvey and Derrick May. But after a weekend of DJs coolly manipulating laptops, turntables and drum machines, there was something visceral about PL's live set, less clinical, more chaotic. The crowd churned like a mosh pit rather than a dance floor and rather than throw cake into the crowd, Mutato Pintado brandished a bottle of vodka lifted from backstage and began to pour full cups of it, passing it out to the crowd.</p></div>"|21288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21288-paranoid-london/|8.2|Andy Beta

Born in 1926, the same year as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a>, he spent his twenties in and out of small-time bands, a promising journeyman moving between playing jazz and the more bar-friendly music that was starting to be called R&amp;B. During these early years he had problems with narcotics and alcohol, alternating stretches of heroin use with periods of binge drinking. Charlie Parker—every sax player's hero when Coltrane was coming up in the 1940s and '50s—had given the junkie life a romantic aura for some naive souls, connecting drug use with creativity. But the underachieving Coltrane was a run-of-the-mill addict, someone broke and in ill health whose habit clearly kept him stuck in place. He was fired from Miles Davis' band in 1957 for showing up on the bandstand dressed in shabby clothes and visibly drunk—by some accounts he took a punch from the trumpeter before being given his walking papers. And if Coltrane had spiraled and his career had ended there, he'd be remembered now as a musician who flamed out just as he was discovering his voice.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But that's not what happened. Everything changed for Coltrane in 1957 when, as he wrote in the liner notes to his defining album, </span><i>A Love Supreme</i><span>, he ""experienced, by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life."" During that year, Coltrane stopped drinking and kicked heroin, and from that point forward, his career would unfold with an almost frightening amount of focus and intensity. These final 10 years are when Coltrane made his mark on the world of jazz as a leader, and he was then seemingly always on the move, in transition, each moment glimpsed as a blur on a continuum rather than a fixed point in space. He wasn't just covering ground, he was </span><span>accelerating</span><span>, and every phase of his later career has the attendant feeling of stomach-dropping free-fall, of being pushed forcefully into new places.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>A Love Supreme</i><span>, recorded with what was later called his classic quartet, is Coltrane's musical expression of his 1957 epiphany. It's the sound of a man laying his soul bare. Structured as a suite and delivered in praise of God, everything about the record is designed for maximum emotional impact, from Elvin Jones' opening gong crash to the soft rain of McCoy Tyner's piano clusters to Coltrane's stately fanfare to Jimmy Garrison's iconic four-note bassline to the spoken chant by Coltrane—""a-LOVE-su-PREME, a-LOVE-su-PREME""—that carries out the opening movement, ""Acknowledgement"". By the time the record gets to the closing ""Psalm"", which finds Coltrane interpreting on his saxophone the syllables of a poem he'd written to the Creator, </span><i>A Love Supreme</i><span> has wrung its concept dry, extracting every drop of feeling from Coltrane's initial vision. </span>It's as complete a statement as exists in recorded jazz. Hearing it now as part of this exhaustive 3xCD set, which gathers every scrap of material recorded during the sessions as well as a live performance of the suite from later the same year, you get a clearer sense than ever before of the different forms <i>A Love Supreme</i> might have taken, and how Coltrane's desire to communicate something specific and profound led to its final shape.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>A Love Supreme</i> is also one of the most popular albums in the last 60 years of jazz, selling the kind of numbers usually reserved for pop (it quickly sold more than 100,000 copies, and has almost certainly sold more than a million since). If Miles Davis' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12283-kind-of-blue-50th-anniversary-edition/""><i>Kind of Blue</i></a> is the most frequently bought first jazz album for those curious about the genre, <i>A Love Supreme</i> is easily number two. But though they were released just seven years apart, there's a world of difference between the two records, and the success of <i>A Love Supreme</i> is trickier to explain. For all its structural daring, <i>Kind of Blue</i> also functions as an ambient record, with slower tempos and late-night ambiance. <i>A Love Supreme</i> is harder to get a handle on. If you can think of Coltrane's work on a continuum, from the gorgeous melodicism of ""My Favorite Things"" or <i>Ballads</i> or his album with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14299-duke-ellington/"">Duke Ellington</a> on one end and the brutal noise assault of the 1966 concerts collected on <i>Concert in Japan</i> on the other, <i>A Love Supreme</i> sits perfectly at the fulcrum, challenging enough to continually reveal new aspects but accessible enough to inspire newcomers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Coltrane may have structured the record for just this effect. He had already been further ""out"" than the music heard on <i>A Love Supreme</i>, including some of the knotty extended jams like ""Chasin' the Trane"" recorded at his 1961 sessions at the Village Vanguard. He was fascinated with the innovations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"">Ornette Coleman</a> from the minute he heard them in the late '50s, and though he never completely abandoned chord changes, he regularly flirted with atonality, improvising outside of a fixed key. With <i>A Love Supreme</i>, it was almost as though Coltrane knew he had to dial things back a little in order to share his message of spiritual rebirth with a wider audience. Though conventionally beautiful in many ways, <i>A Love Supreme</i> is, for many, the exact point beyond which jazz becomes <i>too</i> experimental.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's possible to hear on this set how the album might have gone even further. At a time when a single track might have a dozen collaborators working on it over the course of weeks, it's a little mind-boggling to consider that the music on </span><i>A Love Supreme</i><span> was recorded on a single day, December 9, 1964. This wasn't uncommon for jazz records of the time. </span><span>But though they had the music in the can from that first day, Coltrane wanted to try something else. So on December 10, he called the young tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp, and a second bassist, Art Davis to play with his quartet. The six musicians then ran through two versions of </span><i>A Love Supreme</i><span>'s opening ""Acknowledgment"", so that Coltrane could explore what the music might sound like with another horn and additional low-end rhythm. Shepp was an up-and-comer deeply influenced by Coltrane; the two takes of ""Acknowledgment"" featuring Shepp find him serving as a kind of textural counterpoint, his more brittle and biting tone commenting on the melody from an oblique angle and hinting at possibilities existing outside of the version recorded the day before. You sense a more abrasive road not taken, one that almost certainly would have found a smaller audience.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We hear a different perspective on the fantastic live version of the suite recorded in France five months after the album's release. Five months in '60s Coltrane time was like a decade in the career of other jazz musicians, and he was already imbuing the <i>A Love Supreme</i> material with an extra intensity. Tyner's clanging chords on ""Resolution"" have a harsher edge, and Coltrane's attendant soloing is much rougher and more pointed, his notes seeming to attack the structure of the composition from several directions rather than floating along above it. This is the hard-blowing sound that Coltrane would show on <i>Meditations</i>, another spiritually focused album-length suite recorded later in 1965 that never had a chance at <i>A Love Supreme's </i>level of mainstream acceptance.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the same year, Coltrane would also record </span><i>Om</i><span> and </span><i>Ascension</i><span>, two harsh and challenging pieces of music that strain against the boundaries of what most people would even consider music. Given what surrounds it, and how sweet and gentle it so often is, </span><i>A Love Supreme</i><span> was an expression of a very specific time and place, a conscious attempt by Coltrane to communicate something to his audience that was broad enough to be understood but rich and complex enough to honor both where he was as a musician and the depth of the subject matter. </span><i>A Love Supreme</i><span> sounds like nothing else in John Coltrane's discography, and indeed like little else in recorded jazz, sitting at the nexus of so many competing musical ideas.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The final piece of the </span><i>A Love Supreme</i><span> equation concerns the civil rights movement and black liberation, and how those swirling ideas were inextricably tangled up with the jazz avant-garde.  </span><span>Coltrane was never overtly political</span><span>, </span><span>but he did allow his thoughts and feelings to bleed into his music. Coltrane met Malcolm X, wrote a piece for Martin Luther King Jr., and his 1963 dirge ""Alabama"", a piece with a close tonal connection to </span><i>A Love Supreme</i><span>'s ""Psalm"", was written to commemorate the four girls killed in the Birmingham church bombing that year. As the '60s wore on, politically conscious ""fire jazz"" grew in currency, much of it directly inspired by Coltrane's music, but during his life he never quite felt the need to connect his music to specific social currents, even as others drew inspiration from it in that context. Coltrane was seeking something broader, communing with God as he understood it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For Coltrane, that spiritual journey led him to <i>A Love Supreme, </i>which became the base he'd explore from during his short time left on Earth. Coltrane occupies a unique position in jazz history. He was famous, especially in the jazz world, but he wasn't really a personality. He was not inclined toward interviews and he wasn't very good at them, preferring to let the music speak for itself. He didn't have the mystery of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2813-thelonious-monk/"">Thelonious Monk</a>, the tragic genius of a Charlie Parker, the cool comfort with celebrity or flamboyance of a Miles Davis, the combative verbal dexterity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13106-charles-mingus/"">Charles Mingus</a>, the theoretical underpinnings of Ornette Coleman, the comfort with the mainstream of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/132-louis-armstrong/"">Louis Armstrong</a>, or the symbolic stature of Duke Ellington. He led a quiet life, putting everything into his music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>His chaotic years mostly came when he was an unknown; by the time he was a major jazz figure, almost his entire life was music. If he wasn't on stage or in a recording studio, he was practicing or studying records. Seemingly every other story of an encounter with Coltrane in the 1960s involved him in a room with a saxophone in his hand, playing scales. In his mind, God had saved him, and he was going to give back. </span><i>A Love Supreme</i><span> was his expression of gratitude, a hopeful prayer for a better world.</span></p></div>"|21158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21158-a-love-supreme-the-complete-masters/|10.0|Mark Richardson

From a band who've typically resisted disenchantment against the odds, it’s an alarming statement of rejection. On 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17405-light-up-gold/""><i>Light Up Gold</i></a>, Savage and co-songwriter Austin Brown blazed through mundane minutiae–<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq1LtxdpQEo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""train death paintings, anti-meth murals""</a>–yet saw beauty in the banality; on last year’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajjQ8qp3D0c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Content Nausea""</a>, released as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32587-parkay-quarts/"">Parkay Quarts</a>, Savage yelled denunciations of the digital era in excited bursts, like a smalltown newsreader reporting alien landings. Pitched between stoner gags and urgent instructions, their sizzling one-liners felt like a bulwark against capitalist dread, the battle between righteousness and resignation. <i>Monastic Living</i>, their debut EP for <a href=""http://www.roughtrade.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rough Trade</a> presumably ahead<b> </b>of a full-length in the new year, is them saying, ""We’re tired, that’s enough.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""No No No!"" is unique to the record, in that it has words, a hook, a rhythm you could tap, a sonic and philosophical destination, and replay value. In the liner notes, the track’s expanded lyric sheet blends cliché (""We’re just a band,"" ""retreat into solitude"") and aphorism—""Perhaps silence </span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span class=""s2"">is</span></span><span class=""s1""> purity of spirit""—into a grave mission statement. The remaining eight tracks aren't just wordless but tuneless; they're sometimes baffling, often boring, and always deliberately so.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Part of what makes ""No No No!"" work is that its litany of targets—""open letters, long reads""—is broad enough to appeal to everyone’s digital unease. Parquet Courts are resolutely unchill (""Life’s lived best when scrolling least,"" Savage sang on ""Content Nausea""), bewildered by the hot takes and the jostling think-pieces, as are we all. But these are popular targets, and without the counterweight of wit, Parquet Courts' grand disavowal feels reactionary. On <i>Monastic Living</i>, they make a personal decision to reject a web culture constantly renegotiating what it means to be socially conscious (""I don't want to be an essayist!"" begins Savage's salvo), and in doing so they reclaim art’s right to political neutrality. As statements go, it’s fine but hardly revolutionary—a passionate shrug. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Redeeming moments in the music are scarce. One is ""Vow of Silence"", with its clattering drums, pleading, squealing guitars, and haywire arpeggios, which resemble the misfiring pistons of a manic brain. ""Alms for the Poor"", comprising several seconds of a postpunk riff that dies suddenly, sounds like the husk of a practice session; a chugging number called ""Monastic Living I."" is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"">Battles</a> without the epiphanies.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Unlike that paragon of artistic rejection, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>’s <i>Metal Machine Music</i>, which actually coheres rather nicely, the EP has little textural detail; the music is not immersive, much less transcendent.<i> </i>It isn’t just a score to modern ennui but a work that itself feels indifferent. Yet it’s presented with a straight face: The band are touring the EP and we can buy it, though I’m unsure why anyone would—perhaps its existence as a paid-for product is part of the statement. What it means for the band’s future is, for now, a mystery, though not the kind it is fun to unravel.</span></p></div>"|21301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21301-monastic-living-ep/|4.9|Jazz Monroe

I’m not the only one besotted by Hream Blunt, as Ariel Pink is a champion, while former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29386-hype-williams/"">Hype Williams</a> member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30837-dean-blunt/"">Dean Blunt</a> posits himself as the progeny of the man.</p>
<p>Once hovering in obscurity and mystery, <i>My Name Is</i> makes Doug Hream Blunt readily accessible thanks to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a>’s <a href=""http://luakabop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luaka Bop</a> imprint, no stranger to tracking down itchy, quirky folks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31843-william-onyeabor/"">William Onyeabor</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4741-tom-ze/"">Tom Zé</a>. Even as the comp clarifies some of the Frisco fog that enshrouded that self-released CD and its bootlegged 12"", there remains a slippery, eel-like quality to these 10 songs. We learn in the liner notes that in the mid '80s as a 35-year-old prone to taking odd jobs, Blunt answered a flyer for a workshop called 'How to Form a Band.' Nevermind it was intended for Bay Area teens, Blunt approached the classes with a similar sense of the naïf, imparting that spirit onto the other adult students, four of them women who comprise his band.</p>
<p>There's the spirit of the Troggs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3751-shaggs/"">the Shaggs</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1874-half-japanese/"">Half Japanese</a> to the grooves, something stupid yet undeniable, unlearned yet impossible to replicate. The whinnying, cyclical keyboard figure that Jeannie Killmer repeats ad nauseam on ""Fly Guy"" brings to mind '90s Ethiopian pop as well as what you might come up with at Guitar Center on a synth using the flute patch and your thumb. Even more charming and baffling are the lyrics, where Blunt makes a streetwise observation about capitalism: ""The rich use paper then they charge you more,"" talks about teaching the youth and then adds: ""Girl, I just wanna chill.""</p>
<p>A similarly simple yet inveigling melody and needling guitar sidewinds through the wobbly boogie of said hit, ""Gentle Persuasion"". For all the speculation as to what it means ""to do the ninety-nine"", the notes just equivocate it to the mystery dance itself. Still, it takes a certain kind of Romeo to make a panty-dropping non sequitur of ""like ice, your butt is like dice now, daaaamn.""</p>
<p>Charming as those two tracks are, they both run past six minutes and verge on exhausting. But as ""Big Top"", ""Caribbean Queen"", and ""Break Free"" reveal, Blunt sets about recycling both melodies onto other songs to where their appeal becomes threadbare. Perhaps in keeping with the Haight-Ashbury spirit of his home, each song also contains extended, aimless guitar soloing. And while he might have a two-track mind musically, it's solely one track when it comes to his primary theme. Outside of the last song (an instrumental version of ""Fly Guy""), the other nine share a similar beat and subject, the word ""girl"" uttered in every song. So even as <i>My Name Is</i> pulls back the curtain on Doug Hream Blunt’s mystery music, it also makes clear that the opposite sex will always remain one to him.</p></div>"|21270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21270-my-name-is/|6.8|Andy Beta

As the frontman and principal songwriter of the progressive bluegrass trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6633-nickel-creek/"">Nickel Creek</a>, the California-born musician spent the early '00s pushing an invigorating, risk-taking acoustic melange he dubbed ""newgrass"", imbuing an art form commonly thought of as static with modernist quirks. Since then—Nickel Creek's 2014 reunion notwithstanding—Thile has shifted focus to Punch Brothers, a quintet who churn out the same dexterous roots music with a little more <i>oomph. (</i>Meanwhile, Thile’s Nickel Creek comrades Sean and Sara Watkins issued <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20821-watkins-family-hour/""><i>Watkins Family Hour</i></a>, an LP birthed from the siblings’ monthly residency at Los Angeles’ Largo). Along the way, he’s won a Genius Grant and released several successful solo albums. Next year, he’ll host <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Recorded during the same sessions that beget their last album, last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16802-t-bone-burnett/"">T-Bone Burnett</a>-produced <i>The Phosphorescent Blues</i>, Punch Brothers' latest,<i> The Wireless </i>EP<i>, </i>combines three cuts previously included on that record's deluxe vinyl edition with two never-before-heard tracks, bridging their most recent musical statement with their next avant-American LP. The collection’s diverse blend of pensive instrumentals, rousing singsongs, and stylistic experiments—namely, a roots-y interpretation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdvK9TDnf-Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Clementine""</a>—makes it a great introduction to the Punch Brothers’ quirky, clever bluegrass, as well as a satisfying (if modest) addition to the quintet’s catalog.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Guitar, mandolin, fiddle/violin, banjo, bass, and whiskey-smooth vocals: six sounds—no more and no less—comprise the bulk of Punch Brothers’ deceptively full sound, a paradigm familiar to anyone who’s heard put on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18625-alison-krauss/"">Alison Krauss</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23452-doc-watson/"">Doc Watson</a> LP. The biggest challenge for the group is molding this simplistic sonic recipe into a multitude of forms without falling victim to redundancy (or even worse, directionless noodling)—and Thile and company make it look like nothing. Where slow-churning opening track ""In Wonder"" pits soaring harmonies against a relentless, defiant fiddle, slinky instrumental ""The Hops of Guldenberg"" offers a country-fried take on jazz improvisation. There’s even room for existential banter: centerpiece ""Sleek White Baby"" stars Ed Helms of ""The Office"" fame as an old-timey announcer hawking the answer to all life’s problems against a serendipitous shuffle.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If Punch Brothers' barbershop-quartet harmonies and old-school instruments are the roots tethering the group to bluegrass convention, then their covers are the shoots reaching onwards and upwards, transgressive in origin but puzzlingly traditional-sounding in practice. Thile and company regularly toss tunes fashioned outside of their rusted wheelhouse onto their setlists, as well as on their studio releases; past interpretations include spindly, creaky takes on <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>'s ""Kid A"" and ""Packt Like Sardines In a Crush’d Tin Box"", as well as a prickly spin on ""Icarus Smicarus"", from post-hardcore heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2720-mclusky/"">Mclusky</a>. Like the rest of the band’s covers, ""Clementine"" is not so much a playful dalliance as it is another 20th century addition to the Punch Brothers’ envelope-pushing interpretation of the bluegrass canon. What’s more, by seamlessly integrating Smith’s booze-soaked hymn into the Appalachian-indebted mix, Thile and company don't just solidify the song’s latent transcendency: they propose a challenge to modern conceptions of bluegrass.</p></div>"|21250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21250-sarcosuchus-the-wireless-ep/|6.8|Zoe Camp

As listeners, we both <a href=""http://wamc.org/post/dr-valorie-salimpoor-brain-and-new-music#stream/0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">expect music to adhere to familiar formulae while also teasing our ears with traces of the unexpected</a>. And, as with foreplay, certain artists are just more skilled at extending climaxes into exquisite torture.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>Night of Your Ascension</i>, it takes a full 15 minutes of guest vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a>'s chanting within a funereal 16th-century/Renaissance-styled organ/string/choral arrangement before elephantine guitar chords and drums come crashing through the mist. Even if you listened to this album without any context, you would get a sense that it was building up to <i>something</i>. And if you're aware of the backstory or personnel going into it, you'll no doubt wonder when the metallic element is going to rear its head. Either way, <i>Ascension</i> tests your patience in the best possible sense.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like Wrekmeister Harmonies' two previous albums, <i>Night of Your Ascension</i> consists of madrigal/sacred choral music, experimental ambient music, and doom. This time around (thanks to help from arrangers Eric Chaleff, Cooper Crain, and Sanford Parker), J.R. Robinson takes a developmental leap forward in all three arenas, but it isn't until the beginning motif of the second track ""Run Priest Run"" where all these disparate elements actually blend together, in a passage that lasts in excess of 8 minutes and could easily have appeared on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30274-hundred-waters/"">Hundred Waters</a>' last album. Before being gradually overtaken by electric guitars à la the title track, ""Run Priest Run"" initially fulfills the potential that Wrekmeister Harmonies show on paper as a 30-plus member ensemble drawing on musicians from metal, rock, and new music circles.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Alongside Nadler, harpist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31281-mary-lattimore/"">Mary Lattimore</a>, electro-acoustic sound artist-composer Olivia Block, and Alexander Hacke of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"">Einstürzende Neubauten</a>, the album features members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10726-the-body/"">the Body</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27151-cave/"">Cave</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30075-indian/"">Indian</a>, Bloodiest, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32584-anatomy-of-habit/"">Anatomy of Habit</a>, Come, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32153-twilight/"">Twilight</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30896-mind-over-mirrors/"">Mind Over Mirrors</a>. Robinson leans heavily on these musicians to flesh out his compositions and give <i>Ascension</i> its shape and character. For the title track, Robinson nods to 16-century Neopolitan composer Don Carlo Gesualdo, whose experimental approach to madrigals pre-dated widespread use by a good 300 years.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Gesualdo is also infamous for <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/12/19/prince-of-darkness"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">murdering his wife and her lover</a>. Robinson bases the first half of the title track on Gesualdo's techniques which, incidentally, influenced Igor Stravinsky and inspired author Aldous Huxley to describe Gesualdo's work as ""a kind of musical no-man's land."" The juxtaposition between the tune's classical and doom modes is clearly meant to invoke a sense of the friction between Gesualdo's towering creative presence and the internal torment that drove him to commit murder. Likewise, for ""Run Priest Run"" Robinson looked to the case of Boston Catholic priest Father John Geoghan, who was accused of sexually abusing over 130 boys, convicted, and murdered in prison in 2003 while serving a life sentence.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Once aware of these narrative backdrops, the atmosphere on <i>Night of Your Ascension</i> (and in particular the black metal-styled vocal screeching on ""Run Priest Run"") becomes charged with a dread that elevates this music above the ho-hum gestural negativity of other doom outfits who sound like they're reaching for something to frown over. Robinson draws from real-life tragedy and sexual pathology and does his earnest best to honor the nuances of each case. At the same time, this album's obvious equation of heaviness to violence and psychological despair comes off as heavy-handed.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-fa0d6526-f27d-02f3-073d-f961abafab98"">Nevertheless, <i>Night of Your Ascension</i> faces rote themes like killing, death, and despair from a fresh perspective that aspires to be illuminating. It's also, strangely enough, an album listeners can use to make new friends. Given the way Robinson disposed of musical boundaries to put this music together, it spurs the audience to do the same practically by default. If you're into experimental rock or metal, <i>Night of Your Ascension</i> naturally incites curiosity about madrigals and Renaissance composition. The same applies in reverse. If your tastes fall in any of those areas, you can use this album as a bridge to another world by walking up to someone across the aisle and asking ""Have you heard this? What's your take?"" It's bound to be a lengthy, engaging conversation, not unlike the album itself.</span></p></div>"|21208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21208-night-of-your-ascension/|7.8|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

<p>For a moment there, the Flaming Lips seemed destined to join the also-rans. Released in the fall of 1995, <i>Clouds Taste Metallic</i> was the band’s seventh album, but the first to arrive with any commercial expectations. After a decade on the fringes, the Lips struck paydirt with 1993's <i>Transmissions From the Satellite Heart</i>, whose fluke hit single—""She Don’t Use Jelly""—drove album sales into the low six figures and earned <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9_lBvKMlTI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMiSfUoD3j0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">triple</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJC6GWZGswY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crown</a> of '90s TV appearances. Understandably trying to capitalize on this momentum, the Lips loaded <i>Clouds</i> with more cheery and catchy songs about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n62w20H5foM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">girls doing strange things with foodstuffs</a>. But album sales floundered and, by the fall of 1996, reclusive guitarist Ronald Jones—whose swirling screech was so crucial to the two aforementioned records—had left the band, reportedly out of frustration with drummer Steven Drozd’s worsening heroin addiction.</p>
<p><i>Clouds Taste Metallic </i>is the last album where the Flaming Lips just sounded like some oddballs from Oklahoma, before Wayne Coyne, Drozd, and bassist Michael Ivins refashioned themselves as studio scientists and transformed into the <a href=""http://www.straight.com/files/v3/2012/10/waynecoyneblood.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blood-splattered</a>, <a href=""http://nme.assets.ipccdn.co.uk/images/FlamingLipsTM130910.article_x4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">laser-shooting</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21023-miley-cyrus-and-her-dead-petz/"">Miley-collaborating</a> freak show that’s topped festival bills since the dawn of the millennium. But the record stands as the peak moment in a fantastic four-album run that began with 1990’s <i>In a Priest Driven</i> <i>Ambulance</i>. It's a sturdy wood-paneled shrine to the band’s teenage rec-room touchstones, channeling the shortwave frequencies of <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i>, the fuzz-toned boogie of <i>The Slide</i><i>r</i>, the rustic splendor of <i>After the Gold Rush</i>, the thundering thrust of <i>Houses of the Holy</i>, and a <i>Revolver</i>-like balance of kid-friendly frivolity and strobe-lit freakery. <i>Clouds</i>' sad-eyed opener, ""The Abandoned Hospital Ship"", charts the Flaming Lips’ early '90s evolution in miniature: A creaky Coyne serenade (click-tracked by a wheezing film projector) gives way to a volcanic sludge-rock eruption, but the maelstrom is eventually smoothed over by merry church-bell chimes and swooning choral harmonies. It’s the musical manifestation of what would later become a common Lips lyrical motif—even in the midst of chaos, everything’s going to be okay.</p>
<p>Here, the Lips use distortion to exhilarate rather than annihilate: ""Psychiatric Exploration of the Fetus With Needles"" may rumble like a rocket launching out of your floor, but its perma-grin melody invites you along for the ride. Coyne and Jones’ guitar noise is infused with character and humor, like the spasmodic riffs that personify a patently absurd song like ""Guy Who Got a Headache and Accidentally Saves the World"" or the buzzing surges that power ""Lightning Strikes the Postman"". And there’s also something reassuringly earthbound about their sound—amid the high-octane blast of ""Kim’s Watermelon Gun"", Jones drops in countrified fills like he’s plucking an electric banjo, while the cuteness of ""Christmas at the Zoo"" is kept in check by a George Harrison-style refrain that emulates the weepy tone of a pedal steel.</p>
<p>But if <i>Clouds Taste Metallic</i> pushes Coyne’s lyrical whimsy into overdrive, it also provides the first inklings of the more emotionally charged songwriting that would flourish on 1999’s orchestro-rock opus <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>. Rather than merely <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yydRJDWQa-Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">invoke outer-space imagery for trippy effect</a>, stargazing songs like ""Placebo Headwound"" and ""When You Smile"" find Coyne simultaneously awed and humbled by his infinitesimal place in the cosmos. And the alternately rousing and defeatist ""Evil Will Prevail"" resonated all the more deeply in the aftermath of the April 1995 domestic-terrorist bombing in their native Oklahoma. </p>
<p>The songs that fill out this expanded three-disc 20th-anniversary edition—part of the band’s Heady Nuggs reissue series—likewise capture the Lips at their most down-to-earth, evincing an intimate charm that’s since been vanquished from the band’s increasingly futurist, high-concept music. Even though, post-<i>Transmissions</i>, the Lips were an MTV-approved major-label rock band touring with the likes of Tool, Stone Temple Pilots, and Candlebox, they were more spiritually in tune with the lo-fi pop and skewed, tape-manipulated psychedelia bubbling up from the American indie underground in the early '90s.</p>
<p>The wonderful 1994 EP<i> Due to High Expectations… The Flaming Lips Are Providing Needles for Your Balloons</i> (included here in its entirety) is anchored by an early, slightly scruffier version of future <i>Clouds</i> closer ""Bad Days"", but mostly imagines a parallel '90s where the Lips were signed to Drag City instead of Warner Bros. Woofer-blowing sing-alongs (""Jets Pt. 2"") collide with honky-tonked Alan Vega revamps (""Ice Drummer""), shout-outs to a then-unknown <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"">Bill Callahan</a> (via the live in-store performance of Smog’s ""Chosen One"") and impromptu Christmas carols (""Little Drummer Boy""). The <i>Needles </i>EP is supplemented here by corrosive covers of Bowie (""Life on Mars?""), Bolan (""Ballrooms of Mars""), Sinatra (""It Was a Very Good Year"") and other ephemera, but collectively the bonus material reinforces the lo-fi maxim that a great song can withstand the most unforgiving production.</p>
<p>No song makes that case more persuasively than ""Put the Waterbug in the Policeman’s Ear"", a piano ballad that sounds like it was recorded into a dictaphone that is nonetheless one of the prettiest, most poignant songs in the Lips canon. It also serves as a reminder of a time when Flaming Lips songs required two-minute preambles from Coyne to explain their meaning (in this case, a half-true story about his stoned brother’s paranoid freak-out at a grocery store, and his imagined superhuman ability to telepathically summon insects to attack meddlesome cops). But where the post-<i>Bulletin</i> Lips thrived by translating <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc1syUFmGwU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">serious songs into circus-sized spectacle</a>, back in the mid-’90s, Coyne had a special gift for making the most outlandish concepts seem logical and oddly relatable.</p>
<p><i>Heady Nuggs</i>’ third disc—a bootleg-quality document of a May 1996 show in Seattle—is hardly lacking for expository banter, though the real novelty is hearing the Lips rip through a set untethered to the ceremony and choreography that defines their shows today. It’s a grainy-but-radiant snapshot of the mid-'90s Lips live experience, and the performances—particularly the awesomely interstellar version of <i>In a Priest Driven Ambulance</i>’s ""Take Meta Mars""—capture this version of the band at the peak of their brain-scrambling powers. (You may not be able to see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZxibmeGmo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m35s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the twinkling pinwheel Christmas lights</a> that smothered their stages at the time, but you can more or less hear them.)</p>
<p>But a telling moment emerges from the epic distention of ""Psychiatric Explorations"" that closes the set proper. After stretching what was originally a three-minute song past the nine-minute mark (and seriously straining Coyne’s voice in the process), the Lips sputter out, and within months, their entire guitar-powered aesthetic would follow suit. Ronald Jones was gone just a few months later, and before year’s end, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caRHpkvoDr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the band had turned into something else entirely</a>. Compared to what followed, the Flaming Lips that made <i>Clouds Taste Metallic</i> were just a rock'n'roll band. But this reissue reminds us of what a uniquely wondrous and marvelous rock'n'roll band they were.</p></div>"|21279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21279-heady-nuggs-20-years-after-clouds-taste-metallic/|9.1|Stuart Berman

From his trollish stage name to the plainly ironic bite of <a href=""http://penandpixel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pen and Pixel</a>'s distinctive, lens-flare-heavy aesthetic on the cover of his new mini-LP <i>Sold Out</i>, he reads on first glance like just another node on Internet Art's massive recombination engine, which endlessly churns out kitschy (and occasionally brilliant) assemblages of random late-capitalist pop-cultural detritus.There's also the matter of the style he's working in: footwork is a particularly holistic musical form that until very recently has been virtually inseparable not only from the dance style that it soundtracks, but also from the brutally segregated, impoverished black neighborhoods on Chicago's South and West Sides where it was born.</p>
<p>It's a minor revelation to find out that Paypal's far more sincere than his image would suggest. The way that the drums on<i> Sold Out</i>'s titular opening track pulse in and out of focus is an expert move well out of reach of the average SoundCloud dilettante, and throughout the album he displays the kind of rule-bending that only comes from closely studying the rules first. ""A lot of kids hear like five tracks and start making footwork, and that’s not respectful,"" he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9752-dj-paypals-footwork-of-the-absurd/"">told</a> Pitchfork recently. It's clear from his music that he has listened to thousands and absorbed them into his DNA. And not only does he make incredibly <i>good</i> footwork, he's also helping to clear a path for its future evolution.</p>
<p>Paypal's a member of the L.A.-born <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> coalition of artists representing a certain organic, jazz-indebted segment of bass music experimentalists, and like most of the best material to come out of the Brainfeeder camp, it reconnects beat-based music with styles of pre-digital black music whose more radical avant-garde aspects have been forgotten over the years, or dulled by overfamiliarity—bebop, free jazz, and especially the synthesizer-crazed soul and fusion artists of the '70s.</p>
<p>""Ahhhhhhh"" combines blissed-out piano riffs, pitched up vocal harmonies, and a burbling bassline. ""With Uuuuuuu"" and ""On a Cloud"" teasingly reference early synth-funk (the latter with a vocoder part that Paypal and coproducers Nangdo and DJ Taye blend into a crisp solo trumpet). Other parts of the record reach even further out—""Slim Trak"" folds in Brazilian samba drumming, while ""Say Goodbye"" (featuring Keiska and Tielsie), drifts into a stoned-genius hybrid of dream pop and J-pop that's easily compelling enough to sustain an entire LP.</p>
<p>At the same time, Paypal's also a member of Chicago's venerable footwork music crew <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9642-from-teklife-to-the-next-life/"">Teklife</a>, and his tracks never lose sight of the style's more utilitarian roots scoring YouTube footworking videos and high school hallway dance battles. The old slogan that ""music wants to be free"" is a truer fit for remix culture than the music piracy advocates that coined it. There's a point in the life cycle of every musical style where it has to expand its worldview and open itself up to new participants and new influences, or else it stagnates and withers away. No artist needs to ask permission to borrow an influence, and with so much music available and making it becoming so cheap, it's not even a requirement that you dive more than surface deep into a style before you borrow it. But <i>Sold Out</i> shows what a difference it can make when you hold yourself to a higher standard. </p></div>"|21169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21169-sold-out/|7.9|Miles Raymer

This can't be said for 28-year-old producer André Bratten. Although he records in the same Oslo studio as Terje, Thomas, and Lindstrøm, Bratten's new album <i>Gode</i> is insular and experimental, from conception to execution. <i>Gode</i> is Bratten's second proper full-length record, following 2013's inventively titled <i>Be a Man You Ant</i> and this past summer's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20634-math-ilium-ion-ep/""><i>Math Ilium Ion</i> EP</a>. It's also the most ambitious work of his career, tackling social and historical injustices of the past—namely the serf-like arrangement between farmers and landowners in early 20th-century Norway.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Now, if you're thinking that a double LP about the pre-industrialized Norwegian agrarian economy isn't going to get club kids on the floor, you're right. But this time around that's not Bratten's goal. He wants to tell a story with specific historical context within electronic music, which is an inherently difficult task: A synth stab, field recording, or a programmed drum pattern, however well-conceived, doesn't translate to ""meditation on the darker days of Norway’s past, before the country discovered its oil wealth,"" as Bratten <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2015/10/02/andre-bratten-gode-lp-smalltown-supersound/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has said</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But even if you'd never guess the album's larger themes without reading about it, it's clear from the music that he's attempting something more evocative and wide-ranging. Bratten's production can recall everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s<i> Selected Ambient Works</i> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"">Andy Stott</a>'s murky experimentalism. He's cited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> as an influence, as well as 20th century classical musicians like Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, and Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi—known for creating music that plays off a single pitch that generates almost imperceptible microtonal oscillations. Bratten is resourceful at assembling whatever sounds or styles needed to fit the need of the moment: ""Primordial Pit"" uses mostly live instruments to create a sweeping, post-rock-like grandeur, while ""Ins."", the album's shortest track, is a dissonant string arrangement that is as beautiful as it is unnerving.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For all this wandering, the most overtly pleasing songs on <i>Gode</i> are the ones that call back to Bratten's roots. ""Space Between Left &amp; Right"" has a techno pitter-patter that a patient nightclub crowd could easily appreciate, while the album's title track evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> at their prettiest. Another clear highlight is ""Cascade of Events"", which features the Norwegian pop singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30750-susanne-sundfr/"">Susanne Sundfør</a>, who Bratten had <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzZ1OHj2VJY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previously remixed</a>, her voice shrouded in an analog haze. Having a voice like Sundfør, who has had multiple number one albums in her home country, gives Bratten an anchor to chain his more experimental inclinations to; it'd be fascinating to hear Bratten paired with Sundfør for more than one track.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Given the intentions that </span><i>Gode </i><span>comes packed with, it's tempting to view its success in terms of that story. Does </span><i>Gode </i><span>accomplish Bratten's goal of creating a tribute to the farmers who never had the opportunity to make art because of their circumstances? Quite possibly! But like a museum plaque explaining abstract art to a layperson, background is only a tiny piece of a mostly visceral experience. What's easier to glean, and more universal, is that Bratten has made an expertly produced, emotionally honest record that defies genre and expectation. To understand that requires no homework. </span></p></div>"|21299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21299-gode/|7.4|Nathan Reese

On their studio albums, they are rare arbiters of outside collaboration: They've brought in the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-haxan-cloak/"">the Haxan Cloak</a>, the Assembly of Light Choir, Robert Lowe of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2610-lichens/"">Lichens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3222-om/"">Om</a>, Braveyoung, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30076-thou/"">Thou</a> to expand metal’s capacity for exploring terror and inflicting self-prescribed misery. As a live band, the Body forego experimentation and focus on how far amplification can raise them and test you. Chip King sands you down with both multiplying walls of low end and his voice, a hybrid of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4941-xasthur/"">Xasthur</a>'s Scott Conner's ghostly wails and the bleeding highs of Silencer's Nattramn; drummer Lee Buford is the only drummer with enough force to give aim to King’s projectiles. Choirs, religious speaking in tongues samples, and other details get smothered in the pursuit of absolutely demolishing the audience.</p>
<p>The Body's latest collaboration is with USBM stalwarts Krieg, specifically their mastermind and sole consistent member Neill Jameson. For the Body, it's the closest meeting of their two sides. It's still not quite close to the heaviness of their live shows—when a medium that can capture that emerges, it'll be huge news—but it’s still a convincing document about how both groups see rawness beyond a production style or anti-aesthetic.</p>
<p>Jameson's main contribution to the project is his vocals, which complement and counter King's shrill howl. Where King’s voice can seep into the music like a poisoned wind, Jameson comes through assertively, providing a hardcore edge that is usually more apparent in the Body's live show. He also coaxes rawer work out of them, acting as a pivotal spiritual influence. ""Fracture"" is a house with some of King’s densest noise walls; the suffocation that comes with them playing a narrow dive bar-cum-morgue or DIY house with feeble breakers has never been so effectively bottled. King and Jameson act as an interrogation unit, switching off each other.</p>
<p>Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19180-the-body-i-shall-die-here/""><i>I Shall Die Here</i></a>, the Body, along with Jameson, explore the relationship between metal and dark electronic music. Their cover of Nine Inch Nails' ""Terrible Lie"" on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19970-you-whom-i-have-always-hated/"">You, Whom I Have Always </a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19970-you-whom-i-have-always-hated/""><i>Hated</i></a> has become one of their more heralded tracks, and here, they take on more perverted interpretations of the great electronic and metal clash of the '90s. They warp goth-metal on ""Never Worth Your Name"", taking what would be a gorgeous synth backbone for Anathema or Type O Negative and strips any and all lust. There’s some form of longing left, the only thing left to trace it back to its source material. There's also a deceptive warmth, something also present on their cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3135-sinead-oconnor/"">Sinéad O'Connor</a>'s ""Boys in Black Mopeds"" from the Body’s 2008 tour CD-R. The closest thing to the Haxan Cloak’s touch on <i>Die Here</i> is ""Carved Out and Caved In"", where distant bells work to loosen the guitar into a noise morass. While this collaboration lacks some of the unity of <i>D</i><i>ie Here,</i> it still has enthralling experiments with electronics rarely seen in metal. And for both groups, there’s always the drive for unorthodox aggression.</p></div>"|21201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21201-the-body-krieg/|7.5|Andy O'Connor

On <i>A</i><i>nareta</i>, a record captured during one obsessive, month-long session spent sequestered in bandleader Damian Herring's home studio, Horrendous' playbook feels truly open. It's as if, bona fides well established, the band set out to form a link between the past they once embraced and a future they imagine.</p>
<p>This shift is as clear during opener ""The Nihilist"", where seething whispers curl around a complex math-metal figure, as it is during closer ""The Solipsist"", where a kaleidoscopic melody spins like a spotlight inside a thrash metal bulwark. There are references to antecedents throughout<i>:</i> ""Stillborn Gods"" invokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"">Slayer</a>, while moments of ""Ozymandias"" sound like a Big Four mixtape. The legacy of Swedish death metal looms large, too. But these are the foundations from which Horrendous now sprawl—with bright solos that whip in the wind, with rubber-band basslines that run counterclockwise to the leads, with whiplash rhythms that suggest a short-circuiting carnival ride.</p>
<p>Through all of these twists and churns, the band never seems to be showing off its dexterity, or attempting transitions for their own sake. Horrendous have become masters of pacing and dynamics, instinctively knowing when to let the album and audience breathe. ""Polaris"" progresses from doom metal to black metal to death metal and back to doom seamlessly, as though a DJ had spent hours perfecting the cuts between it all. On the first five minutes of ""Acolytes"", they plow through a grindcore sprint and settle into a dense and demanding death-metal section, with a squealing little riff tucked carefully into a rhythm section that refuses to sit still. These additions lend the momentum of mystery to these songs, which surprise every time you hear them.</p>
<p>One of the most glorious moments on the album, and in metal this year, arrives as a revelation at the end of ""Acolytes"". Unexpectedly, the guitar stalls, locking into one glowing note as the drums retreat into a low-tempo tap. Then, a new arching riff radiates outward, as though the guitar has suddenly emerged from a mountain's shadow and into the midday sun. The drums double and triple their pace, while Herring musters one final, fade-away scream, like a hero taking his leave of a scene. It's a beautiful passage, as redemptive as anything on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather/""><i>Sunbather</i></a> and as cathartic as the closing moments of a symphony.</p>
<p>Though they sound quite different, <i>Anareta</i> has a lot in common with my other favorite metal album of the year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31931-tribulation/"">Tribulation</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20329-the-children-of-the-night/""><i>The Children of the Night</i></a>. On their earliest albums, both bands wrestled with the past, rendering death metal anew as competent revivalists. But in 2015, they have both stretched those traditions, filling accepted frameworks with unlikely elements. The influences are still recognizable, but the results are no longer obvious. This quest even comes written into <i>Anareta</i>'s wonderfully narrative lyrics, where the aim for mortal meaning serves as the <i>cri de cœur</i>. ""Forging a new reality/ Embrace the burning dawn in me,"" goes the end of ""Acolytes"". Indeed, metal can value faithful, enthusiastic recreations more than heretical ingenuity, and vice versa. But like Tribulation, Horrendous show the value of compromise within a record that creates its own middle ground—and stands right there for eight tracks, stunning.</p></div>"|21134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21134-anareta/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

It’s as if she knows intimately the nauseating experience of waking up one morning, surveying a half-lived life, and thinking, ""Oops."" She never adopts a schoolmarm’s consternation (and she is entitled to some authority, having sold a boggling 30 million copies of her last record, 2011’s <i>21</i>), but she is nevertheless cautionary,<b> </b>encouraging her listeners to do better, act faster, stop being such a bunch of clowns. Get up and get over, friend, she seems to be saying—you are a grown person now.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Or: ""We both know we ain’t kids no more,"" which is how she puts it on ""Send My Love (To Your New Lover)"", a song co-written by Max Martin, the 44-year-old Swedish super-producer who has now penned almost as many number one singles as Lennon and McCartney. Stack ‘em up, and all of Martin’s songs follow a particular formula: they’re prickly, quick-moving affairs that braid the precision of Swedish pop like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6-abba/"">ABBA</a> with the more groove-oriented rhythms of American R&amp;B. To that end, Martin is as exacting of a songwriter as I’ve ever heard: like he did with the tracks he made for Taylor Swift (""Shake It Off"", ""Blank Space"", ""Style"") and Katy Perry (""I Kissed a Girl"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Roar""), he relies on some enigmatic internal cadence, clipping syllables like a hiccuping poet, taking a tiny scalpel to his melodies. He keeps his lines pointy and balanced. ""Send-my-love/ To-your-new/ Luh-uh-ver."" The results are like encountering a person with perfectly symmetrical features—both instantly appealing and deeply, existentially unsettling. The song opens with carefully plucked acoustic guitar, and when the chorus comes in it’s as if someone yanked the curtains up on a dark room.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lyrically, Adele leans on a familiar kind of outrage, reckoning with a lover who broke every promise he ever made to her. There's unrequited love, but then there’s love that changes shape; if you’re unlucky enough to be on the receiving end of that transaction—made unwilling witness to the mysterious, alchemical shift in which devotion suddenly thins, sours—true understanding is impossible, a fool’s errand. This is the love that Adele sings of, the kind where there’s nothing left to do but resign: ""I’m giving you up, I’m forgiving it all."" Nurturing grudges is a young woman’s game.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Almost every song on <i>25</i> addresses heartache in one form or another. ""Send My Love"" is anomalous in its confidence; more often, Adele sounds excruciatingly aware of her own blunders and bereavements, and the ways in which time has made them indelible. </span>Sometimes, Adele herself is the agent of grief, like on ""Hello"", in which she attempts to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reach an ex-lover on her flip-phone</a>. Surely, on some level, Adele knows the message she’s so hungry to deliver—""I’m sorry/ For breaking your heart""—is not the kind of sentiment that’s going to yield her much more than a slowly raised middle finger (the indignation of the recently forsaken is vast, merciless). She is arguably more desperate to reach an earlier iteration of herself, to correct something, quiet some panic.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Other times she is a victim of loss. In the piano ballad ""When We Were Young"", which was co-written with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32424-tobias-jesso-jr/"">Tobias Jesso Jr.</a>, she sings: ""Let me photograph you in this light/ In case it is the last time/ That we might be exactly like we were/ Before we realized."" The instrumentation swells, quiets. The precise nature of that realization is not named, but of course it doesn’t need to be, or not explicitly (as Joan Didion wrote, in 1967, ""It is easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends.""). The song itself is a kind of homage to the booming, soft-focus singer-songwriters who dominated AM radio in the 1970s (Barbra Streisand, Shirley Bassey), and Adele’s vocal performance is astonishing, full of vigor and beauty.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Still: the cumulative effect is sometimes as treacly as the heavily frosted sheet cake being slid onto the buffet table in the carpeted banquet hall where this song will be blasting, on a loop, for all of eternity. Even your most adorable aunt—the one who loves a Yankee Candle—will eventually drain her flute of sparkling wine, lean forward, and be like, ""Dog, this shit is corny.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Taken as a whole document, it is truly staggering how many of these songs—all of them, as far as I can tell—address the foibles of romantic love. It’s not so much that Adele’s lyrics are platitudinous (although they often are), it’s that the album’s prevailing sentiment eventually becomes wearying. In his book </span><i>The Song Machine</i><span>, John Seabrook interviews Bonnie McKee, the 31-year-old songwriter behind some of Katy Perry’s bigger hits and a frequent collaborator of Martin’s; McKee offers a pat, sorry-dude response to the question of lyrical uniformity in contemporary pop. ""Most people still just want to hear about love and partying,"" is what she tells Seabrook. A shrug—a ""Hey, it’s not us, it’s you! You dummies are the ones who want that!""—is implied.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-105ced74-25ac-0bbc-5e0f-93777f0102b8""><span><span><span>Perhaps that <i>is</i> what people want: Adele is presently on track to break N*Sync's record, held since 2000, of 2.24 million copies sold in the first week of release (<span class=""aBn"" data-term=""goog_1672064110""><span class=""aQJ"">on Friday</span></span>, more than 900,000 people downloaded <i>25</i> from the iTunes store alone). And perhaps these songs are trifles, foregone conclusions that, instead of facilitating or inviting a deepening, allow for just one outcome: a peaceable head-bob, a wistful smile. They are one-way, dead-end roads, emotional shortcuts to wells of loss and contrition. But regardless of how one might feel about the spiritual utility of pop music, Adele’s instincts as a singer remain unmatched; she is, inarguably, the greatest vocalist of her generation, an artist who instinctively understands timbre and pitch, when to let some air in. It does not seem unfair to ask that dynamism of her songs, too.</span></span></span></span></p></div>"|21246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21246-25/|7.3|Amanda Petrusich

This writer was in attendance for a show where she took a moment to defend herself from the claim, which was followed by a not-sober fellow yelling out an unprintable word and the name of this website, a moment that made at least one person in the vicinity feel very uncomfortable. You can understand how she would take it as a backhanded compliment: There's something unavoidably infantilizing about the suggestion that your voice resembles a fictional cartoon monarch's, even if Snow White could really sing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It makes her sound so… formal, too, and while Prass makes music inspired by classic artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5038-dusty-springfield/"">Dusty Springfield</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22032-dionne-warwick/"">Dionne Warwick</a>, she's no traditionalist. Covers of modern musicians like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10541-janet-jackson/"">Janet Jackson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18-ryan-adams/"">Ryan Adams</a> have snuck their way into her sets, and she even popped up on the AV Club last month to turn the gory chug of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"">Slayer</a>'s ""Raining Blood"" into an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61619-natalie-prass-covers-slayers-raining-blood/"">inside-voice delight</a>.<i> Side by Side</i> shows that playful side, comprising two live cuts of songs from her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20088-natalie-prass/"">self-titled solo debut</a>, as well as covers of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a>, Anita Baker, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel, artists whose only obvious connection is ""singers that Natalie Prass decided to cover on her new EP.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Her take on Baker's ""Caught Up in the Rapture"" does away with those awesomely '80s gated drums and sparkling filter sweeps, instead pushing the tempo and adding guitar for something a little more lively. On the original, Baker welcomes the listener with open arms through some magical doorway, where the evening of a lifetime awaits. Prass sings from a more present place, like she's three beers into a muggy summer night at a Nashville bar. She makes the gentle folk-rock of ""Sound of Silence"" a little more lively, nailing those melodies with her graceful, nimble voice. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17367-grimes-realiti/"">""REALiTi""</a> is done as a straight up ragtime jaunt, and if her press release commentary on the cover (""[Grimes is] probably going to say 'what is this jazz shit' and hate it"") is maybe a little too accurately self-deprecating, she at least commits. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The live versions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17281-natalie-prass-my-baby-dont-understand-me/"">""My Baby Don't Understand Me""</a> and ""Christy"" strip away the dense orchestral instrumentation and let a Wurlitzer piano do the driving. The arrangements are cleaner, and show her mastery over negative space. One knock on the self-titled record was that Prass sometimes sounded secondary to the orchestra, but here the same can't be said. My favorite moment on the original LP was at the end of ""My Baby Don't Understand Me"", where the repeated refrain of ""our love is a long goodbye"" built to a grand climax. On the live take, she lets the groove ride a few seconds longer, transforming the swelling romance into something steamier.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Similarly, the nighttime vibe of the unadorned ""Christy"" precludes all future Disney princess comparisons, as she lets the lonesomeness of the lyrics (""Why does it have to be that she can take the hand of anyone she meets?/ Still, the only one she sees belongs to me"") really sink in. In this, </span><i>Side by Side </i><span>does what a good EP should—it reminds us of what she's skilled at, while showing off some other strengths. There's even something like a mission statement to her music in the title, and the song it's taken from: ""When I feel the magic of you/ The feeling's always new."" It's an old sentiment, and the lyric belongs to another artist, but Prass makes it hers.</span></p></div>"|21275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21275-natalie-prass-side-by-side-ep/|7.2|Jeremy Gordon

The relationship between exploratory, Grammy-nominated funk-jazz outfit Kneebody and pioneering Cali beat scientist Daedelus (born Alfred Darlington) goes back almost a decade, evidenced by <a href=""https://kneebody.bandcamp.com/album/daedelus-remixes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remixes</a> on Bandcamp and a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOvaxYl1h08"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stage collaboration</a> at the Jazz à Vienne Festival in 2009. Kneebody saxophonist Ben Wendel and Darlington are high school friends, while Darlington and Flying Lotus go back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9740-1983/""><i>1983</i></a>, Ellison's debut, and Darlington's indelible <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZSTxFuxBq4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of the title track.</p>
<p>What all of this six-degrees business adds up to is this supernova of a record, rounded out by Adam Benjamin on keyboard, Shane Endsley on treated trumpet, bassist Kaveh Rastegar, and drummer Nate Wood. As a collaborative unit, the friendship between the parties undoubtedly lends itself to the fluidity of these 10 original compositions. In some cases, as on tracks like the rugged ""The Hole"" and the hypnotic ""Move"", you can't really even tell where Kneebody ends and Daedelus begins. Darlington's deft rhythmic impulses come to the fore on ""Drum Battle"", but in other moments, the invincible horn section of Kneebody runs the show. On ""Loops"", Endsley's trumpet is cat-like and cool, as the group takes the scrambled-signal breakbeat Daedelus delivers to the snapping point around the horn's calm center like a hurricane eye. On ""Platforming"", meanwhile, Wendel's fantastic Art Pepper-esque tenor work is transformed into a wild, distorted-violin sound. Elsewhere, its Benjamin who is leading the charge on the seven-minute <i>Mwandishi-</i>flavored space-out ""Thought Not"", and the haunting processed upright piano he plays on ""Not Love"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Yet its when Kneebody and Daedelus fuse that <i>Kneedelus</i> achieves its potential. And perhaps no other track really embodies that idea more than ""Home"", the album's deep modal center that simmers together Tubby dub, <i>TNT</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>, and Lalo Schifrin. It's no matter of happenstance the cover of <i>Kneedelus</i> is a shameless emulation of the design format of another game-changing jazz record label, ECM. This album exists in a very similar atmosphere to some of Manfred Eicher's bolder production moves throughout the last 40-odd years (dig that <a href=""http://www.jackdejohnette.com/?audio=special-edition"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jack DeJohnette box set</a> for proof). And above all, it's a vision offering one last reminder before the year is out that Brainfeeder is very serious about its place in the jazz world. </p></div>"|21240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21240-kneedelus/|8.0|Ron Hart

You can hear that influence in the sparse, wiry productions that he has been recording since the beginning of this decade. They're not made for fist-pumping, and they don't follow neat verse/chorus structures. They ripple and writhe unpredictably, marked by an improvisational sense of movement. They seem to move of their own accord.</p>
<p>Anderson comes from the same corner of the house and techno universe that has given us artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32771-levon-vincent/"">Levon Vincent</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31936-anthony-parasole/"">Anthony Parasole</a>, and <a href=""http://strengthmusicrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DJ Qu</a>, a fellow dancer. Like them, he favors analog drum machines, hardware synthesizers, and what sounds, above all, like a lot of playing of keys and twisting of knobs in real time. Much contemporary electronic music is composed visually, assembled brick by brick on a computer screen, but Anderson's snake-in-the-grass meanderings suggest live takes stacked one on top of another, thanks to the magic of multi-tracking.</p>
<p>""18 Arms"" goes straight to the heart of his approach. True to its name (leave it to a dancer to come up with a title like that), it opens with a synthesizer pattern that squirms like an octopus' tentacles, and as the track accrues its fistfuls of counterpoints and layers, it becomes easy to imagine the producer as a one-man band. At any given point on the album, three or more synthesizer parts are being woven together; drum hits are flaring up and being muted again; a hi-hat's pitch seesaws up and down. The cumulative effect of all these techniques is at once chaotic and elegant, and fluid above all.</p>
<p>But how the music is put together is ultimately less important than how it feels, and Anderson's music is all about feel. It's hard to put your finger on the emotions they evoke, but you're moved all the same. (""'Deep' to me is like the human condition that you don't talk about, that you hold in forever until you are in front of that right person"" Anderson <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?2048"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Resident Advisor, which might go some way towards explaining the slipperiness of his music's emotional register.) A song might be calm and meditative: the spacious ""Organ to Dust"" is a study in stillness in which quietly accelerating figures move like quarters spinning to a halt on the floor. ""Nabta Playa"", named for a drained basin in the Egyptian desert, is fleet and mysterious; in both sound and mood, it's reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1149-drexciya/"">Drexciya</a>'s Afro-futurist fantasies, and the Detroit icons' fizzy textures and frantic movements also inform ""Amarna"", whose title refers to the tomb of the Pharaoh Akhenaten. It's the album's most unhinged track, with wildly filtered drums that thrash desperately about. It sounds like music for punching mirrors; it moves like someone trying to escape his own shadow. True to the corporeal bent of Anderson's album, it locates emotion not in the mind but in the muscles.</p></div>"|21258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21258-invisible-switch/|7.4|Philip Sherburne

<p dir=""ltr"">As if his presence weren't unpleasant enough, the sample delves into the various techniques Ross used to murder his victims. Presumably, the team of artists who made<i> N.V.</i> would argue that real-life horror is <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">fair game for evoking a reaction</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">(namely: disgust)</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> with art</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">.</span></span> In fact, judging from two recent interviews, it seems likely that Dragged Into Sunlight even managed to disturb <i>themselves</i> with this record, and that de Jong draws from headline-news violence in his work because it genuinely frightens him. Not to mention that the sound clips are lifted from TV documentaries that sensationalize these acts while purporting to condemn them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Still, the inclusion of these samples is flat-out despicable and speaks volumes about how decades of desensitization have blurred not only the lines of good taste but of common decency as well. If </span><i>N.V.</i><span> is any indication, actual murder has become indistinguishable from any other image we passively ingest from the safe, numb remove of our computer monitors. Once artists adopt ""extremity"" as the cowardly affectation that it is, they leave themselves little choice but to keep pushing the envelope. The musicians on </span><i>N.V.</i><span> would probably insist that they went this far precisely </span><span>because</span><span> they wanted to make the audience feel something. <span class=""im""><span style=""border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">But to indulge them in a rewardless thought-loop by debating their intentions is to allow them to manipulate you and waste your time.</span></span></span><br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's a shame,<span> because <i>N.V.</i>'s lurid first-person homicide monologues overshadow</span> <span>its wealth of sonic character</span>. Both of these acts are defined by their (arguably unparalleled) ability to create atmosphere, which makes their yin-yang pairing a natural fit that, on paper, overflows with possibilities. Judging from their respective bodies of work, there's no doubt that Dragged Into Sunlight and Gnaw Their Tongues could have rendered tunes like ""Visceral Repulsion"" scary—and taken the audience into a truly murderous, sexually depraved headspace—through other, more imaginative means. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5311-pig-destroyer/"">Pig Destroyer</a> frontman-lyricist J.R. Hayes, for example, scares the daylights out of you and dives even further into the same thematic terrain but manages to get there without trampling on anyone's grave.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Billed as a joint effort, <i>N.V.</i> actually bears the stamp of two other significant contributors, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"">Godflesh</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu/"">Jesu</a> founder Justin Broadrick and Corrupt Moral Altar drummer-producer Tom Dring. Having produced the first two DIS albums, Dring once again had a hand in shaping the sounds throughout the making of <i>N.V.</i>, while Broadrick stepped in as co-producer and sonic overseer later, during the mixing stages. By that point, the initial collaboration had yielded three hours' worth of raw material spanning five years' worth of on-again, off-again back and forth with DIS and de Jong working out of their respective homebases in England and the Netherlands.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Stretched as it was over time, distance, and multiple perspectives, </span><i>N.V.</i><span> sounds surprisingly focused and, musically speaking, rather non-indulgent (perhaps because Broadrick, Dring, DIS, and de Jong boiled the final product down to a 32-minute runtime). Broadrick's input is somewhat difficult to discern, but de Jong's touch saturates this music. Even in the spots where Dragged Into Sunlight blasts away and it seems like there's no room to cram in any more sonic information, de Jong is there, hovering like a toxic, mind-altering haze that burns your eyes, chokes your throat, and soaks into your skin -- sensations that are not without their appeal.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Dragged Into Sunlight had already created a sense of psych-ward hysteria with the black-grind hybrid they established as far back as 2008's </span><i>Terminal Aggressor</i><span>, and their ability to use raw ingredients like cymbal wash, inhuman-sounding vocal shrieks, reverbs, and delays gave their music a queasy hall-of-mirrors feel that set the band apart from other likeminded peers. </span><span><span class=""im""><span style=""border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><span>On </span><i>N.V</i><span><i>.</i>, they turn to Mories as a kind of set designer <span style=""color: #000000;"">who fleshes out and brings spacial and tactile dimension to the Liverpool quartet's caustic exorcisms. <br/></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Naturally, as an almost supergroup-like meeting of the minds between three highly production-conscious acts, <i>N.V.</i> is crammed with details that don't initially reveal themselves. But even if de Jong and Dragged Into Sunlight grasp the scale of the tragedies they've chosen to rub the audience's nose in, the fact is they're contributing to trivializing the victims in these cases. <span>Will listeners respond to <i>N.V.</i> the way we might once have tittered at</span> the gross-out slasher fantasies on early Cannibal Corpse records, or will they recognize the distinction?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At this stage in the game, metal bands should consider it their creative if not human responsibility to view these well-worn subjects through new lenses. Being ""more extreme"" for its own sake is not only lame but creatively and ethically bankrupt. That said, there is undeniably an art to <i>N.V.</i>'s execution. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Together, its participants combine layers of abrasion that can be rewarding if you can, well, get past the visceral repulsion.</span></p></div>"|21242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21242-nv/|5.5|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

He dropped the ‘Young’ out of his name when he realized he wasn't young. The hooks to his biggest songs are so blunt they skirt deadpan humor—""my president is black, my Lambo is blue"" works in a shockingly efficient manner, a mission statement that unpacked a hell of a lot at the right time in history in just two lines. He’s envisioned himself (on album covers at least) as a mafia don, Malcolm X, a patriot draped in the flag. His trademark grimacing snowman logo is as identifiable as a corporate brand.</p>
<p>Fresh off the release of last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19786-young-jeezy-seen-it-all-the-autobiography/"">Seen It All: The Autobiography</a></i>, he's releasin<i>g</i> <i>Church in These Streets</i>, and they are both as literal as their album titles. In his latest venture, Jeezy is a preacher, the wise, older veteran of an Atlanta rap scene that is currently worlds away from his grim motivational seminars. <i>Church in These Streets</i> doesn’t completely deliver on its compelling premise—a ""reborn"" Jeezy, half-conscious but still the self-proclaimed ""God in these streets."" There are some moments that strike this note, especially the spoken-word interludes that broadly touch on social issues like privatized prisons, police brutality, and even the toll of drug dealing on the lives of the hustlers and the buyers (especially striking on a record with a song called ""Hustlaz Holiday""). But they do just feel like <i>moments</i>, a snapshot of a project Jeezy is unable to make.</p>
<p>After a few years of toiling in major-label purgatory, Jeezy’s new persona (and it is a ""persona,"" not a guiding aesthetic principle) is good for a few effective, if perhaps obvious, metaphors and symbols. The song titles, just like the album title, give it all away: ""Lost Souls"", ""Holy Water"", ""God"", ""Forgive Me"". He deserves credit for turning a new album around in just a year that’s influenced by his feelings and thoughts on the current political climate, but it feels workmanlike and too deliberate to hold weight. It is conspicuously light on guests, probably by design, but Jeezy’s voice can wear during sustained listens, and when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/"">Janelle Monáe</a> shows up on the light, totally un-Jeezy-like single ""Sweet Life"", she’s anonymous. </p>
<p>The vibe of the music seems to suggest that Jeezy wants to bring the dank and spacey stuff that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a> work with into his playground, but grounded in his declarative, raspy voice. It's minimal, exciting stuff, the kind of creative pivot he executed so well just a few years ago overseeing CTE. ""Gold Bottles"" has a weak hook but features typically baroque production from London on da Track. ""God"" works that same apocalyptic tone of so many 808 Mafia productions: It’s a good song until you realize it’s essentially a redux of Future’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4_Luckf5bE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sh!t""</a> from a few years ago.</p>
<p>""Just Win"" is another highlight, riding a mournful horn sample that recalls socially aware blaxploitation movies and their rich scores, specifically Willie Hutch and the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqspHHI-a10"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soundtrack</a> for <i>The Mack</i>. It also samples Les Brown, a motivational speaker, and the song's dynamic nails the highs and the lows of this record—it clearly wants to be a meaningful, contemplative record, but it mostly reduces his action-hero slogans to blander political ones. The best Jeezy music often exploited how far he could go with memorable ad libs and punchlines, a triumphant kind of simplicity. Here that gets muted to muddied results.</p></div>"|21164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21164-church-in-these-streets/|6.0|Matthew Ramirez

After dropping last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18930-freddie-gibbs-and-madlib-pinata/""><i>Piñata</i></a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> at the helm — the rapper’s most commercially and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9558-the-50-best-albums-of-2014/"">critically</a> successful project to date — he could have taken some well-deserved time off. Instead, he toured non-stop and played <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/49-pitchfork-music-festival-2015/1462-freddie-gibbs-madlib-perform-scarface-pitchfork-music-festival-2015/"">festivals</a>, put out two EPs <i>The Tonite Show </i>with the Worlds Freshest and <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/gangstagibbs/sets/pronto/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Pronto</i></a>, and last but not least, became a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/9wWXi5hmNP/?taken-by=freddiegibbs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">father</a>.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Now with little advance notice, and a raised middle finger to Q4 release schedules and anyone foolish enough to be making their best-of year-end lists early, the pride of Gary, Ind. is back with his third full-length studio album. A quick scan of the credits reveals the biggest difference between <i>Shadow of a Doubt</i> and his last LP—instead of one singular producer, there’s over a dozen wide-ranging names contributing beats here from Canadian hitmaker Boi-1da to 808 Mafia’s Tarentino. While the final result is less cohesive, and could benefit from trimming two or three songs, there’s no denying Gibbs’ versatility. </p>
<p class=""p2""> If there’s any question as to whether or not acclaim has mellowed the man who frequently refers to himself as both ""Gangsta Gibbs"" and ""Freddie Corleone"", look no further than the two tracks that bookend the record. The sparse, atmospheric ""Rearview"", which opens with a ""Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport"" P.A., sees the rapper offer up a bullet point summary of his career to date before dismissing would-be copycats with trademark precision. In contrast, ""Cold Ass Nigga"" sees Gibbs with two feet on the gas, with frequent <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a> collaborator Mike Dean providing a suitably urgent, glitchy trap beat. It’s nothing like anything else in Gibbs’ vast catalogue (its closest spiritual companion might be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16975-freddie-gibbs-young-thug-aap-ferg-old-english/"">""Old English""</a>, his 2014 track with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30648-aap-ferg/"">A$AP Ferg</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>) and it’s proof that the 33 year old is still more than willing to push himself out of his sonic comfort zone.</p>
<p class=""p2"">His lyrics capture the pursuit of the American dream like a Scorsese screenplay (drugs, sex, and all-too-frequent bloodshed included). He’s hardly the first artist to incorporate a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1mmePD549o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sample</a> from ""The Wire"" into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17788-freddie-gibbs-fuckin-up-the-count/"">song</a>, but he’s one of few able to do so without it coming off cliché or rote (Boi-1da and Frank Dukes’ sinister piano loops greatly help). Another highlight is the understated, introspective ""Insecurities"" produced by Dukes and Montreal’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31672-kaytranada/"">Kaytranada</a> (who teamed up with the rapper this year for the menacing one-off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59171-freddie-gibbs-kaytranada-team-up-on-my-dope-house/"">""My Dope House""</a>). </p>
<p class=""p2"">As for the record’s handful of guest spots, Gibbs has picked a mix of newcomers and veterans who complement but never overshadow him. Rising Miami-via-Toronto emcee Tory Lanez contributes a bleary-eyed hook to dealers’ anthem ""Mexico""; elsewhere, L.A. R&amp;B singer-songwriter Dana Williams propels ""McDuck"". On ""Extradite"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"">the Roots</a>’ Black Thought’s politically charged verse is sharply juxtaposed with Mikhail’s bright, jazz-influenced production, which eventually gives way to dialogue taken from a fiery <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIyl-AqSUU8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">speech</a> on Ferguson by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Then there’s ""10 Times"", featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/%20"">Gucci Mane</a> floating over the beat like plumes of blunt smoke (perhaps Gibbs’ own <a href=""http://nugs.com/article/freddie-kane-og.html%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Freddie Kane OG""</a> strain), before West Coast veteran <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"">E-40</a> swoops in to gleefully extol the virtues of a woman ""thicker than a buttermilk biscuit.""</p>
<p class=""p2"">On the outro of ""McDuck"", we hear an excerpt from an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsWfusHadPI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> he did with Snoop Dogg this past summer discussing Gibbs’ background. ""You just sound like you not from nowhere,"" says Snoop to which the rapper replies, ""I created that sound."" The cover artwork of <i>Shadow of a Doubt </i>might depict Gibbs’ face half-cloaked in darkness, but his roots and aspirations have never been clearer.</p></div>"|21274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21274-shadow-of-a-doubt/|7.8|Max Mertens

The band's guitarist, singer, and songwriter Cosima Jaala has said that she would struggle to identify any tempo—with the exception of 4/4, which, <a href=""http://www.yenmag.net/music/track-premiere-jaala-hard-hold/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in her words</a>, can ""go fuck a dead donkey."" Instead, the record's rushing, halting feel is her attempt to reflect life's complex rhythms. It's complemented by an unusual but brilliant pop palette that splutters with the chaotic energy of a Jackson Pollock.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">The interplay between guitarists Jaala and Nic Lam, bassist Loretta Wilde, and drummer Maria Moles recalls Thrill Jockey's '90s Chicago set, splashy as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> and richly mellow as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"">the Sea and Cake</a>. ""Lowlands"" ambles around a crooked bass line; ""Order"" has a splayed ska-punk lilt that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"">Clash</a> ballads. Jaala sings with a jazzy, muscular intonation and a chalky squeak in her throat that recalls a punkier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/"">Amy Winehouse</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/494-jeff-buckley/"">Jeff Buckley</a>, and also owes a debt to the skittish incantations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5402-life-without-buildings/"">Life Without Buildings</a>' Sue Tompkins. When she screams, as she often does, it's not with rage, but roller coaster joy. Considering how rampant the pace is—and Jaala's predilection for ""brain-melting shit""—<i>Hard Hold</i> is often remarkably soothing, yet always surprising.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">Jaala's lyrics are just as playful as her delivery, full of twists and wonderful imagery. They often deal with the ties that bind humans—love, obsession, violence—and she's just as interested in stretching the bonds of language. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17703-jaala-hard-hold/"">""Hard Hold""</a>, she wrings the endless potential of a single syllable. ""It's hard, a heart to a heart/ Too hard to unfold this hold with you,"" she sings, as if massaging out her own heartbreak, working agility back into her ticker's knotted muscle. ""If sharing is a bowl of soup, then you drunk it dry,"" she tells her ex before she proclaims her newly discovered strength, a moment heralded by the song's buoyant lope bursting into a frenzied thrash.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">Swaying between downbeat and more anxious passages, ""Salt Shaker"" captures Jaala's relief and guilt at leaving her humdrum seaside hometown. She licks salt off her hand to remind herself of the waves, and observes: ""Those happy-holy-heinous houses/ They spread out and out for mileses."" She's a distinct voice, and a versatile one, too: ""Ticket"" is a serrated tirade against an ex who used her, full of ugly screams and jagged riffs. But then comes closer ""Hymn"", a tender devotional where the band's edges soften to glimmer like sea ripples reflected on a cave wall.</span></p>
<p><span><i>H</i></span><i>ard Hold</i> is a clever record that rarely foregrounds that fact—perhaps because it was recorded in a week, it hangs onto a scampering, impromptu quality that only adds to its appeal. While they sound nothing alike, Jaala's debut has a similar sense of fluid, approachable experimentation to a record like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13159-bitte-orca/""><i>Bitte Orca</i></a>: the kind of bright weirdness that seems to illuminate a whole new set of colors.</p></div>"|21300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21300-hard-hold/|7.8|Laura Snapes

Her early work still feels only slightly displaced from <a href=""http://www.4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a> and ambient music; though Enya has never been comfortable identifying her music as ""new age,"" it shares new age's fixations on geology and infinity, which also appear in the music of contemporary acts, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"">Mark McGuire</a>. But as her career advanced her songwriting and the architecture of her albums solidified into a kind of extreme aesthetic discipline, and her songs began to melt inextricably into each other. <i>Dark Sky Island</i> is her first album in five years, since 2008's Christmas-themed collection <i>...And Winter Came</i>. I can say with some confidence that it's her best record since 1995's <i>The Memory of Trees</i>, but I'm not certain if that means anything to anyone, including myself. Her albums generate a very specific environment, one which envelops the listener regardless of the quality of her individual songs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Enya's music is primarily about distance: between minutes, between people, between stars. Her songs stretch accordingly, synthesizers advancing and receding within them like shadows. Sometimes her music seems to move with the velocity of a glacier. Drums are employed sparingly. Either her vocal is the rhythmic engine of the songs (as in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTrk4X9ACtw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Orinoco Flow""</a>, or on this album, ""Echoes in Rain"") or the rhythm is organized into arpeggios that sound like crystal, and which are often generated from a Roland Juno 60 synthesizer. There are also sudden clusters of sampled timpani in her music, but they provide shape to her songs more than they provide any animation. The way she constructs her music out of samples gives her otherwise warm and amniotic compositions a kind of Arctic and alien dimension.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Her songs feel sharper on </span><i>Dark Sky Island</i><span> than they have in years. Its textures are glassier; the individual sampled string hits on ""Echoes in Rain"" sound like arthritic branches sprouting from a frozen earth. The ballads are heartbreaking. ""I Could Never Say Goodbye"" and ""So I Could Find My Way"" describe an incredible distance that can't be collapsed; in the case of ""So I Could Find My Way"", that distance is the vastness between life and death. (She wrote it about her producer Nicky Ryan's mother.) Elsewhere she (somewhat invisibly) experiments; in ""Sancta Maria"" a synthesizer collides gently against more classical instruments in a way that seems to clarify each. She sings several interstellar ballads in Loxian, a language her lyricist Roma Ryan invented, though the language is mainly experienced on record as a blur of vowels. (These ""experiments"" of course merge seamlessly with the rest of her work; they're composed of the same glossy surfaces and drift through identical rhythms.)</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-33e543d9-2080-bcc1-ce7a-30e715661099"">Her first two albums, <i>Enya</i> and <i>Watermark</i>, are much more digressive and rhythmically diverse than her later work, including <i>Dark Sky Island</i>; for every gentle, shapeless ballad, there would be exercises in more precise, classical forms, or a song would unfold into a more distracted rhythm. Most of her songs since have been subject to a merciless symmetry. She drifts somewhat out of her aesthetic on <i>Dark Sky Island</i>'s ""Even in the Shadows"", which pulses like an artery from the double bass playing of Eddie Lee; as a result, it's one of the best songs on the record. But it matters little. Though her approach has calcified, the environments generated by her records are still singular, a gentle, untroubled, indefinite ambience that is very soothing to inhabit. It's like being embraced by the air.</span></p></div>"|21237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21237-dark-sky-island/|7.1|Brad Nelson

A co-president of the beloved, minimalist-focused <a href=""http://rootstrata.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Root Strata</a> label, Croy devotes much of his time to building a sophisticated, wonderfully weird roster of artists (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29506-the-alps/"">the Alps</a>, and Driphouse have all issued LPs on the label): but he's also earned a reputation as a gifted electroacoustic auteur. Devane, meanwhile, comes from a guitar background, tempered by a love for the digital greats (as his <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/astrangelyisolatedplace/aphex-twin-rhubarb-james-devane-acoustic-version"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">acoustic cover of Aphex Twin's ""Rhubarb""</a> attests). The duo’s latest, <i>City of Brides</i>, is their most cohesive—and perhaps paradoxically, sonically varied—statement to date. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Establishing a sense of momentum when nothing moves is one of the biggest challenges in drone music. On <i>City of Brides</i>, Croy and Devane supply propulsion through juxtaposition: not just between the organic and the artificial, but also between the serious and the playful. For every period of restraint—the two-part, vaguely erotic shadow play of ""Songs for Diminished Lovemaking"", for instance—there’s a burst of playfulness to balance it. On the buoyant ""Mendocino Nature Rave"", the duo ventriloquize their motherboards to reproduce the sounds of dolphins, bats, and other wildlife, while<i> </i>""Hall of Mirrors"" sounds like a thrilling, grim game of Peek-A-Boo, constantly threatened by melodramatic synth swoops. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There are no samples to speak of on <i>City of Brides;</i> every sound we hear is built from scratch. Each song is a crystalline Russian doll, a stylistic experiment in layering sounds both comforting and caustic. ""Blonde Is Back"" is the most magnificent, its warm swathes of synths simultaneously soothing and suffocating. The experience of listening to it isn’t that far off from being smothered by a fleece blanket.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The diversity of the instruments here helps distinguish <i>City of Brides </i>from peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30088-pete-swanson/"">Pete Swanson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/73-oren-ambarchi/"">Oren Ambarchi</a>, or influencers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"">La Monte Young</a>.<i> </i>On ""Mark of the Slav"", En use a koto to create a foggy soundscape before drifting out into the horizon. In addition to honoring its reputation for graceful precision, En challenge the koto’s inherent solemnity by way of energetic arrangements that render it assertive, even abrasive; its shattered-glass-strums break the reverent murmur of ""Secret Samba"". Indeed, one could make a strong case for Croy’s playing as <i>City of Brides</i>’ secret weapon: a valuable source of energy on an extensive, occasionally exhausting album.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If you’re not a fan of drone, <i>City of Brides </i>probably won’t turn you into an acolyte. The LP gets off to a sluggish, vaguely narcotic start with ""Blades"" and ""Dead Ringer"", two relatively straightforward ambient pieces that lack the standout quirks of later tracks. Those looking for a more leaden approach may walk away disappointed as well; Devane’s guitars never reach the intensity of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>. Nevertheless, there are plenty of secrets refracted through <i>City of Brides</i>' glassine spaces—and peering through such a globally-inspired prism is arguably as compelling as any seismic axe riff.</p></div>"|21233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21233-city-of-brides/|7.4|Zoe Camp

Receiving top billing is the Israeli singer and composer, Shye Ben Tzur, who wrote the songs. Then there's his backing band: the 19 performers, hailing from distinct Indian-music traditions, who form the Rajasthan Express. And you've also got <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>'s Jonny Greenwood contributing rhythm guitar, bass, keyboards, and drum-programming to the arrangements. </p>
<p><span>Still, aside from the album's complex backstory and multilingual lyrics (written, variously, in Hebrew, Hindi, and Urdu), </span><i>Junun</i><span> is readily approachable on its own. </span>When Aamir Bhiyani’s rhythmically crisp trumpet peals out over programmed and acoustic percussion during the first minute of the album's opener and title track, <i>Junun</i> establishes its celebratory side. (Instrumental virtuosity and rhythmic drive: check and check, respectively.) Then the singer comes in, delivering an attractive setting of Sufi mystic poetry. (Warmly humanistic vibe: check.) The song could easily coast from this point. But once a tempo downshift hits, midway through, the assembled performers sound even more exultant. (Are you dancing yet? I was.)</p>
<p>It's the wealth of smart musical touches that make Ben Tzur's songs feel so emotionally legible. The bowed strings of ""Hu"" have a vulnerable quality that contrasts winningly with the song’s more full-throated vocal exclamations, while Ben Tzur’s breathy flute playing complements Greenwood’s tinny digital programming on the opening of ""Kalandar"". And the gradual acceleration of a vocal-driven number like ""Eloah"" also contributes to the album’s impressive range of textures.</p>
<p>""Chala Vahi Des"" starts out with melancholic vocals delivered by Afshana Khan and Razia Sultan, before throttling into a harmonium-and-drums groove. In the song’s final section, Greenwood’s surprisingly funky bass playing enters into a dialog with the vocalists and drums. Also making an appearance, during the chorus of the triple-meter tune ""Allah Elohim"", are the ghostly, sliding tones of the <i>ondes Martenot</i>—an early electronic-keyboard instrument that is one of Greenwood’s favorites. (He's used it on <i>Kid A</i>, <i>Hail to the Thief</i>, as well as in his score for <i>There Will Be Blood</i>.) Given the prominence of his guitar on the same track, ""Allah Elohim"" is one of the rare moments on <i>Junun</i> that sounds directly influenced by Greenwood's other work.</p>
<p>Concerning Greenwood's mostly background role: the sight of a famous British pop musician collaborating with lesser-known artists from another hemisphere can easily prompt charges of exploitative appropriation. But since Greenwood’s latest releases on <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nonesuch</a> have all focused on his work as a composer of <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/inherent-vice-soundtrack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">film scores</a> and <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/threnody-for-the-victims-of-hiroshima-popcorn-superhet-receiver-polymorphia-48-responses-to-p"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">classical music</a>, the pop-world conversation about cultural tourism doesn’t seem all that helpful here.</p>
<p>A better reference point<i> </i>would be the tradition of modern composers looking to escape the ""Eastern"" and ""Western"" category trap.<b> </b>In his 2015 memoir <i>Words Without Music</i>, American composer Philip Glass <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=OpPXBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT376&amp;dq=words%20without%20music&amp;pg=PT109#v=snippet&amp;q=%22world%20music%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recalled how</a> ""it was very common in the 1960s for Western musicians, even composers, to be completely ignorant of global, or world, music."" Glass, for his part, famously followed up his studies of the Western canon (at Juilliard and in Paris) by traveling to India, where he eventually worked for Ravi Shankar. Other composers associated with the minimalist movement, such as La Monte Young and Terry Riley, spent decades investigating Hindustani raga with Pandit Pran Nath.</p>
<p>As a post-minimalist himself, Greenwood is a natural heir to that history. And so after happening upon a composer like Ben Tzur, he’s <a href=""http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/radioheads-jonny-greenwood-on-performing-with-shye-ben-tzur-at-the-alchemy-festival-9382301.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>apt to decide</span></a> to ""discover more about him."" <span>What Greenwood found was a composer splitting his time between the </span><span>Middle East and India, who has</span> managed to develop a unique fusion form that is <a href=""https://newrepublic.com/article/123123/junun-wants-you-figure-out-indian-music-yourself"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>constructed from several traditions</span></a>—including Bollywood-style brass exuberance, the devotional Qawwali music of Sufi Islam, and bowed-string instruments associated with the Manganiar community.</p>
<p><span>The result is a mix that includes folk feel </span><i>and</i><span> studied arrangements.</span><span> </span>Naturally, with Greenwood's participation comes that of longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, who succeeds in presenting this detailed music with precision. While Greenwood's presence guarantees a certain level of interest, the newsiest takeaways from this album involve the skill of Ben Tzur and the musicians of the Rajasthan Express. The ensemble’s playing and the leader's compositions make <i>Junun</i> an easy stretch—though, crucially, not a condescending one—for listeners otherwise unfamiliar with the great variety of methods often obscured by ""world music"" market-speak.</p></div>"|21213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21213-junun/|8.0|Seth Colter Walls

The relative positions of the cards gave Chasny a ""tonal field"" in which to operate, as well as a set of notes from which to pick, some indication of time and tempo, and lyrical rules for the songs themselves.</p>
<p>Though Chasny describes it as a ""caveman"" appropriation of similar constructs by Anthony Braxton and John Cage, it is involved and elaborate enough <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/products/the-hexadic-system"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to prompt a book, <i>The Hexadic System</i>, published by Drag City this year</a>. And February's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20074-hexadic/""><i>Hexadic</i></a>, his public debut with the system, felt like an attempt to declare its formidable nature. Showcasing the scope of the system felt as important as the songs. Unapologetically loud and aggressive, with more than a whiff of hardline Japanese psych, it was an extreme indoctrination into a new approach. Recorded with a fully loaded quartet, the largely instrumental <i>Hexadic </i>was not for the faint of heart or those accustomed to Chasny’s softer side.</p>
<p>For <i>Hexadic II</i>, though, Chasny used the same results of the system to create new solo versions of the songs. He swapped the electric for the acoustic, added soft murmurs of harmonium and electronics and strings, and sang on almost all of the songs. The output gives the Hexadic System a new patina of accessibility. On the penultimate track ""Vile Hell"", Chasny jumps between notes at unexpected angles, sounding like Derek Bailey in a windstorm, before he stops playing altogether. He lets a faint, luminous drone linger until it spills over into ""Poor Guild"", the record’s gorgeous finale. Violinist Jen Gelineau matches the drone’s tone, and Chasny picks his way through it. In a keening falsetto, he offers a series of elliptical, evocative phrases—""tiny excess/ eye maligned/ depict, transfix."" It is the most purely pretty moment in Chasny’s enormous catalogue, the sight of an early bloom, opening slowly after an arduous winter.</p>
<p>The nine tracks on <i>Hexadic II</i> follow the same order as their <i>Hexadic</i> counterparts, and careful, comparative listening does reveal analogous aspects. It’s more rewarding, though, to consider the differences, or to take the sets as entirely separate products of the same process. The disparity shows just how far Chasny may be able to take an idea still in its early stages of execution. Where ""Wax Chance"" was a diabolical, noise-soaked dirge, ""Exultation Wave"" is an exquisite gallop, with multiple guitar lines and multi-tracked vocals suggesting the density of the earlier work without trying to match it. Likewise, the two-minutes of no-wave roar from ""Maximum Hexadic"" unfurl here into eight minutes of circular picking and ghastly vocals for ""Anyone’s Dawn"". Chasny’s playing invokes the same Middle Eastern influences that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/577-sir-richard-bishop/"">Sir Richard Bishop</a> has often conjured, while his singing recalls the fragile coo of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4689-richard-youngs/"">Richard Youngs</a>. What was shocking is now sublime.</p>
<p>In that way, the Hexadic System feels like a prism for Chasny, able to draw different elements of his influences and approach based on the input and circumstances. The results are novel <i>and</i> approachable, a combination that enables Chasny to transcend the examples of Cage and Braxton, at least in execution. Despite the complexity of the system that produced <i>Hexadic II</i>, the songs and sounds measure up to the setup itself.    </p></div>"|21189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21189-hexadic-ii/|7.8|Grayson Haver Currin

Accordingly, the music distances itself from the cyclical payoffs and rhythmic underpinnings of the dance floor. This is miles away from anything that could be considered ""club culture."" There’s something acutely alien about the tracks Morgan constructs, as if the producer is dealing in a musical language that's yet to fully emerge.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Agitations</i>, Lotic's signature spidery sound design is subjected to further mangling via a series of violent jump-cuts and jarring bursts of noise. The arrangements treat sounds and themes like raw materials in need of repurposing: Each unit is contorted, smashed, and remade, either splintering into abstraction or writhing in glitchy tumult. Yet, for all the mixtape’s disorienting ruptures and serrated edges, <i>Agitations</i>, much like 2014's <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/janusberlin/lotics-damsel-in-distress"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Damsel in Distress</i></a> and this year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20319-lotic-heterocetera-ep/""><i>Heterocetera </i>EP</a>, again reveals Lotic as a sly, playful producer. On <i>Heterocetera,</i> Lotic sampled the ballroom standard ""The Ha Dance"" by Masters at Work, reshaping it radically, and he alludes to this same sample again here in the opening moments of <i>""</i>Carried"". This version sounds pared-down and pixelated, a mutation of a mutation, and it's a microcosm of <i>Agitations</i>' tendency to tease out strange turns in familiar currencies.</p>
<p><i>Agitations</i> might not be conventional dance music, but it remains both fiercely visceral and highly visual. It lacks <i>Damsel in Distress</i>' <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/gesamtkunstwerkk/lotic-faded-how-the-hell-feat-the-queen-barking-stans-and-cbs-censors"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mastery of cultural memory</a>, and <i>Heterocetera</i>'s propulsive push-and-pull, but more than makes up for it in raw dynamism; a dogged, thrilling futurism hinged on brute energy, angularity, and unremitting disquiet. Moving in dense, unstable clusters, the mixtape can be taken as a celebration of frustration, liberation, and chaos, a means for Morgan to work through the restlessness and anxiety he's faced of late. For an artist who's consistently latched onto and forged a style as imaginative as any in the electronic underground, <i>Agitations</i> shows Lotic pushing still further ahead.</p></div>"|21277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21277-agitations/|8.2|Jonathan Patrick

<p dir=""ltr""><span>The second installment of his debut solo venture, </span><i>Rave Cave 2</i><span> interweaves themes from the original but stands strong on its own, and is in fact denser and richer overall. ""Ashill"" </span>forgoes the syncopated swing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20405-rave-cave-ep/""><i>Rave Cave</i></a>’s opener, ""Fables"", but still embodies that cheeriness. Though the choppy and sharp melody initially seems out of joint with the accompanying smooth, heady synth bass, the more repetitive it becomes, the more it settles in.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Throughout this EP, Hung emulates the juxtaposing elements found in the nature of youth, a time in life when everything is confusing and you have to navigate a path through conflicting options. ""Repetition vs Time"" summons a childlike wonder and calm, with an intentionally cheesy chorus and boom-bap beats invoking nostalgia for playing keyboards in high school music class. Towards the latter end, the song is more reminiscent of video game menu music than anything else, but perhaps this is intentional. Hung’s littering of 8-bit grace notes is ultimately refreshing, and an apt ode to his work as one half of Fuck Buttons.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""That thing you want won’t make you happy"" is distinctly melancholic in comparison to the rest of the record. It carries the melody of a more somber '90s boy band ballad, and closes with finger-picked acoustic guitar tinged with subtle reverb. ""Star Ferry Dub"" immediately starts off as a pounding antithesis to the previous song. It’s heavy on the ears and on the heart, flashing a raw hedonism seldom found in the <i>Rave Cave</i> series. The song rings in the musical themes evident throughout the EP—we are reintroduced to the 8-bit ornamentation of ""Repetition vs Time"" and that thumping arpeggiated bass echoing ""Ashill"", but this time the ghosts of these tracks are more lingering and intense. There’s so much going on at once that it’s hard to pin down, but the complexities and wide sonic scape don’t sound excessive or sloppily piled on top of one another.

Both were interested in doing nervy hip-hop that rendered personal neuroses into allusive, bittersweet comedy (and vice-versa). They know each other now as transplanted Angelenos with deep mutual respect, a faithful cult fanbase, and a creativity-stoking environment of collective support—but those neuroses can still be hard to shake. They keep finding successful ways to exorcise those frustrations, cracking jokes and facades at the same time. Naturally, they'd have a lot to ricochet off each other, something that sporadic teamups only hinted at.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Time &amp; Materials</i> gives that dynamic a shot over the course of 26 short minutes, proving more than anything that there's more depth still left unexplored. The album's recorded under the name Cavanaugh, and the setting of this brief-but-deep album is intriguing, in a J.G. Ballard-via-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/840-the-coup/"">The Coup</a> kind of way: the inhabitants and social structures of a Florida mixed-income project featuring units for both luxury condos and subsidized housing tenants. ""Mike and Dave"" are resident handymen who schlep from residence to residence, glimpsing other people's lives while doing what they can to keep the same systems functioning for the rich and the broke alike. And in the process, they channel the residents' class-war conflicts into their own combative moods, fueling their own stress over money, relationships, and an uncertain future that keeps them from being the assertive successes they want to be.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Time &amp; Materials</i> tackles sociological themes that would be sledgehammer-obvious in less-nuanced hands. But the duo draws you in by skimping on or misdirecting details. Serengeti disappears deeper into his lyrical role than Mike does—understandable from an MC who's been known to do half a live set in the guise of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=kenny+dennis""><span>a cranky, bellowing 50-year-old</span></a>. But for his first full-length production job, Mike sets a tone as raw-nerved and abrasively contemplative as the concept demands. A soupy drone on ""Typecast"" evokes the stress and sweat of the escape-seeking protagonists, including guest turns by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3484-pos/"">P.O.S.</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/512-busdriver/"">Busdriver</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands/"">Future Islands</a>' Sam Herring in his purposefully-awkward rap alter ego Hemlock Ernst. The creaking sludge of opening track ""Zorak"" underscores the TV-casualty free association of the lyrics.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The big drawback of the production's distorted, synthwave-on-codeine atmosphere is that it threatens to muffle the rewind-demanding intricacies of both MCs—Serengeti's motormouthed turns of run-on worldbuilding in particular get trickier to grasp. It's also not always clear whether the characters Mike and Serengeti inhabit are the maintenance guys or the people they cross paths with and intrude on by necessity. Of course, the larger question is whether they're really inhabiting or observing outside characters at all—""I"" heavily outnumbers ""you"" and ""they"" in the whole narrative pronoun department, and the fraying seams of their own mind states stand out no matter who's being profiled.</span></p></div>"|21239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21239-time-materials/|7.2|Nate Patrin

You can hear conventional musicality inside of his tracks—melodies, chord changes—but rather than being fixed on paper, they are always in flux. Individual notes twitch and vibrate, refusing to stay with a single pitch; rapidly shifting clusters hint at proper chords without ever quite committing to them; tempos speed up and slow down according to whims rather than the grid of a timeline. Arca’s deeply organic machine music is defined by Ghersi’s ability to find grace in imperfection.</p>
<p>Ghersi has come a long way in a short time, his career the sort of underground/mainstream hybrid that could only happen in the digital era, when producers rapidly move from sharing home-recorded beats online to working with stars. Though his music has varied greatly, you’ve always been able to hear his voice inside of it. The first music heard from Ghersi was a series of three low-profile releases in 2012 that made small waves among electronic music heads but were little heard outside of that circle. But among that group was someone working on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>’s 2013 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a>, and Arca wound up contributing to four tracks, including ""Blood on the Leaves"" and ""I’m in It"". That same year, he also produced for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>, helping to create a futuristic pop that was simultaneously dense and spare and defined by its elusiveness. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19836-arca-xen/""><i>Xen</i></a>, Arca’s 2014 full-length debut, expanded Ghersi’s range further, sounding like a bent version of modern classical music crumpled into a ball with a post-dubstep beat tape. Music created for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58076-arca-releases-sheep-musical-score-from-hood-by-air-fashion-show/"">a fashion show </a> in Italy earlier this year spoke further to Ghersi’s ability to move between genres, scenes, and high/low art boundaries, and his continued collaboration with artist Jesse Kanda on the visual aspects of his work make Arca a project with a rare thematic integrity. He’s developing quickly but building on a clear foundation.</p>
<p>If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> took the playful communal energy of early-'90s rave and turned it to highly personal art, and producers of the early '00s like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"">Fennesz</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a> showed how emerging software could be used to create new worlds, Arca is making the abstract electronic music of our current moment, music for an idea of humanity that exists outside of binaries. ""Xen is a genderless being,"" he told <i><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/31/arca-bjork-kanye-west"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Guardian</a></i> last year. ""It’s about resisting labels and integrating different sides of ourselves."" Accordingly, Arca tracks are never one fixed thing: Conventional beauty is swirled together with ugliness, aggressiveness exists alongside serenity, chaos and form fail to cancel each other out. <i>Mutant</i> is an album of contrasts, and Ghersi has an uncanny ability to let extremes interact with each other to create something new.</p>
<p>The 20 tracks here stretch for over an hour, but lines between them are unclear, and when heard at once the record can seem like one long suite, treating us to an array of sounds and moods. You can imagine ""Vanity"" as a piano solo, so pretty and memorable are the central melodic motifs, but Ghersi’s production on the track is essentially a series of controlled explosions, the sound of a song breaking into a million pieces and re-assembling itself. ""Alive""’s drones are positively cavernous, sounding like a memory of an ancient civilization bubbling up through a hole in the earth, and he breaks up the static drift with splattering breaks that jolt the song at irregular intervals. The repeated vocal loop on ""Umbilical"" is one of the few sounds on the record connected to life on planet Earth, but it’s mixed in with some of the album’s harshest and coldest electronics. As the tracks tick off and you lose track of how far into the album you actually are, the clarity of Ghersi’s vision comes into focus. The broken-ness of the music takes on an empowering energy, as oblong fragments bind together into gorgeously weird shapes and dynamic shifts that shouldn’t make sense feel perfectly logical.</p>
<p>Compared to <i>Xen</i>, <i>Mutant</i> feels less composed and less indebted to classical music. With many tracks on the former album you could squint a little bit and imagine them being performed by a daring new music ensemble, à la Aphex Twin with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/244-alarm-will-sound/"">Alarm Will Sound</a>. But <i>Mutant</i> leans toward soundscape, avoiding proper songs. There are moments in the back half, particularly on ""Enveloped"", where beats crop up and you can imagine them being used to back a pop production of some kind, but even here the warped instrumental patch used for the melody is too strange and otherworldly for an artist that has ever been on the radio. It’s not an easy listen; this is glorious music that sounds like a living thing, and it can be hard to connect the album to anything outside of itself. Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí said that the straight line belongs to man and the curved to God; on <i>Mutant</i>, Ghersi turns a fixation on porousness and instability into a kind of spiritual pursuit.</p></div>"|21231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21231-arca-mutant/|8.4|Mark Richardson

From his work driving the early dubstep scene to the formidable rise and influence of Hyperdub, Goodman’s vision is one that is singular in its devotion to the connective tissues of electronic and dance music genres. In Kode9’s music (and littered throughout the Hyperdub roster) is a harmonious bridge between styles. His music is not without history and ideas, and Goodman openly embraces it.</p>
<p>The most complicated forms of techno and footwork are built simply, from the ground up, and on <i>Nothing</i>, we hear the simplicity of each component and how it all comes together to make the music that we love. ""I’ve always tried to be open to the idea of music as transversal, as impersonal – like a cloud, or a virus that passes through populations,"" Goodman <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/16/kode9-nothing-album-steve-goodman-hyperdub-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> <i>The Guardian</i>. ""It might start with an individual producer, but once it’s out in the world – as an entity that’s inhabiting, parasiting, using human bodies as hosts – somehow it attains a collective intelligence all of its own.""</p>
<p>Consider the unnerving pull of a synth that sounds like a dying insect working in tandem with piano on ""Vacuum Packed"". The track builds into footwork-light with hyper-paced rhythms and a cutting beat that is maybe the record’s most danceable moment. ""Void"" is a slow-burning and dubby wonder that contains empty moments where his former musical partner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19705-spaceape/"">Spaceape</a>, who died in 2014, was originally intended to vocalize. ""Holo"" is the record's brightest and most enjoyable moment, built on airy samples and a spastic beat that is difficult to forget. <i>Nothing</i> leaves you awash in the sounds of the everyday: The static of the television not turned entirely turned off, the lull of old appliances stumbling to stay on after years of wear and tear.</p>
<p>There is a precision and effort laced in his two previous albums, 2006’s <i>Memories of the Future</i> and 2011’s <i>Black Sun</i>, that clearly mark a singular producer’s craftsmanship. But on his latest work, this point feels more eloquent from start to finish. Goodman described this record as one about zeroes and about ""nothing."" In that same interview with the <i>Guardian</i>, Goodman said, “If replication and distribution costs are tending towards zero, this is one of the most important engines in the transformation of the music industry. We don’t know where it’s heading. ‘Nothing’ was like a little encryption key that enabled me to finish the album.""</p>
<p>A quick glance at song titles confirms this trend, at least stylistically. There is ""Zero Point Energy"" and ""Notel"". There is ""Void"" and ""Zero Work"". And there is the album closer, ""Nothing Lasts Forever"", a nearly 11-minute journey through the noise of silence, a kind of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"">John Cage</a> tribute for the new millennium. Awash in static and the sporadic, indescribable clanging of the day-to-day, the track helps define the work as a whole in a clearer way than the songs before it. If, as Goodman notes, things are tending toward ""zero,"" then this track is the literal manifestation of this idea. Still, there is value in the zero and value in ""Nothing Lasts Forever"". In the absence of music, in the zero, there is still presence, still sound, still something to hear (and even enjoy).</p></div>"|21221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21221-nothing/|7.6|Britt Julious

For starters, creating a debut that not only sees the light of day, but is successful enough to warrant a follow-up. In certain cases, that first album is everything they’ve been waiting to say for years, but the second album is the bigger test, as it proves that the artist has something to say beyond the cathartic release of emotions heard on their debut effort. For instance, Logic’s 2014 debut, <i>Under Pressure</i><span>, was a detailed account of his chaotic Gaithersburg, Md. origin layered with his method of coping with stress while trying to escape the situation before it consumed him. It was honest and, on occasion, </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/uak-SaRqr3I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>impressive</span></a><span>. The announcement of his second collection, </span><i>The Incredible True Story</i><span>, generated questions about how Logic could follow something as intricate and personal as </span><span><i>Under Pressure</i>.</span><span> Where could he go? The answer: outer space. </span></p>
<p><i>Under Pressure</i> was evidence of Logic’s attention to specifics, which he remains committed to on <i>The Incredible True Story</i>. You may have noticed him <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=bIInvYbY9XA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">often wearing a NASA flight jacket</a> leading up the album’s release, similar to a movie director wearing a t-shirt or hat emblazoned with the name of his latest film. On <i>The Incredible True Story</i>, he assumes the role of screenwriter and director, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-9006vZiEM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claiming to have written a script</a> for the album. It’s set 100 years in the future, as the two narrators, Thomas and Kai, search for a planet named Paradise following Earth’s destruction. (Thalia, who served as the <i>Midnight Marauders</i>-inspired virtual guide on <i>Under Pressure</i>, returns as the computer for the ship driven by the narrators. Thankfully, she’s still more Siri than <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HAL 9000</a>.) During their journey, the duo revisit the past through Logic’s music.</p>
<p>Because Logic’s catalog serves as an artifact in the album’s narrative, the early placement of ""Fade Away"" is calculated. Over a dreamy sample reminiscent of a doo-wop song, Logic reflects on death’s inevitability: everyone dies eventually, so strive to create something that lives on after you. ""Upgrade"" maintains the futuristic theme (<i>The Fifth Element</i> allusions and all) as Logic explains how success has altered both his day-to-day existence and his perspective.</p>
<p>Despite being set in the future, the album takes time to dip into the past. On ""Young Jesus"", Logic and guest Big Lenbo trade verses over producer 6ix’s recreation of '90s hip-hop ambiance. Its highest points come on the second and third verses, where Logic hands the song off to Big Lenbo like they’re performing live and sharing a mic. Logic’s introspective thoughts match the mellow calm of ""Innermission"", as he longs for the ability to revisit certain moments just to dwell in them again. It’s a moment of clarity most folks arrive at as they get older: you’ll never be present in your memories again.</p>
<p>This is another constant theme on <i>The Incredible True Story</i>—Logic’s evolution under the spotlight. ""City of Stars"" finds him at his most sincere. Once Logic’s harmonizing breaks, his and 6ix's production becomes more aggressive as Logic unloads his frustrations with hip-hop, including the fixation on the biracial MC’s appearance. ""I didn’t talk about my race on the whole first album/ But black versus white bullshit was still the outcome,"" he rhymes, clearly exasperated. He then takes aim at critics, amateur and professional, who chide <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> for harping on ""money and bitches"" yet praise <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"">2Pac</a> for doing the same. Logic is at his best when getting shit off his chest, but even in the midst of these brazen admissions, there are still missteps.</p>
<p>From its off-kilter drag to his deployment of boast-riddled yells in the place of bars, ""I Am the Greatest"" reeks of Drake’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20271-if-youre-reading-this-its-too-late/""><i>If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late</i></a>. Recycled flows and rhyme schemes are common in this era of hip-hop, but there’s a fine line between homage and imitation. Furthermore, while Logic has proven himself to be a talented MC who respects hip-hop culture and puts obvious effort into his work, there’s very little on <i>The Incredible True Story</i> that's worth constant replays. The music is enjoyable and Logic’s ambition is evident, but the final product just doesn’t attach itself to the memory.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-532741cf-11ea-cb67-46d5-e30f58bdee24""><i>The Incredible True Story</i><span> is a pleasant voyage to Paradise orchestrated by an artist who’s earned the approval of legends from Rick Rubin to </span><a href=""http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.31719/title.logic-big-daddy-kane-set-to-collaborate-on-record"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Big Daddy Kane</span></a><span>. Logic has the tools to create music that has longevity, but has yet to unlock the characteristics that truly set him apart. If he’s able to tap into that, his subsequent releases will have the impact he aspires for. </span></span></p></div>"|21216.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21216-the-incredible-true-story/|6.1|Julian Kimble

The group's sophomore album, 2013’s <i>Pink Tape</i>, was a pop collage of ambitious sounds and ideas that tinkered with K-pop formulas, and it still stands as one of the best records the genre has ever produced. Last year’s <i>Red Light</i> offered a decidedly edgier synthpop sound that leaned more toward the club, though it didn’t quite meet the standard set by its predecessor. And during the promo for <i>Red Light</i>, group member Sulli, an actress and star for the conglomerate S.M. Entertainment, was noticeably absent from scheduled media events. After talk of mental exhaustion and a temporary f(x) hiatus, Sulli officially withdrew from the group in August, leaving K-pop’s most consistent act in a state of flux.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><i>4 Walls</i> is f(x)'s fourth album and first with four members—hence the name—and it lands right where <i>Pink Tape</i> and <i>Red Light</i> intersect, creating a sleek electropop fun-house filled with an eclectic group of generation-spanning pop singles that fit together as a long-playing piece. It’s also the first K-pop comeback to fully acknowledge a lineup change—going as far as incorporating it into the album's marketing and lyrics—but it doesn't change much about the group’s sound. This is a superficial rebirth; though the album’s lead single and title track has veiled references to changing and becoming new, f(x)’s synthpop bounce remains steadfast and uncompromised. And though Sulli was undoubtedly a standout among the group, her departure allows others to grab the spotlight: Now, not only does rapper Amber have the opportunity to rap more, she also gets the chance to use her alto range to flesh out harmonies and bring greater balance to records like ""Rude Love"", an ambitious, hook-heavy tune that rivals the group's most infectious songs.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Many tracks on <i>4 Walls</i> are sourced through Jam Factory, a music publisher that uses American musicians to create lyrics and melodies for Asian markets. The company’s strength lies in penning sounds without borders, and some of <i>4 Walls</i>’ strongest collaborations involve producer LDN Noise, who creates pop songs with bridges that function as hooks and transitions that overlap to keep songs stimulating. Album closer ""When I’m Alone"", meanwhile, was originally co-written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen/"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a> for her recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/""><i>E•MO•TION</i></a> album. But the real X-factor is longtime f(x) collaborator, writer, and K-pop superproducer Kenzie, who wrote two of the album's most curious songs: ""Papi"" and ""Cash Me Out"". A Berklee School of Music grad, Kenzie navigates the cultural divide better than anyone.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Listening to any K-pop record (or any foreign language record, really) can prove to be a challenging experience for casual listeners simply due to the added communication barrier. You can also lose some key information in translation—even when you know what's being said, there's a layer of context missing. Still, just like any other type of music, a listener has the opportunity to fill in some of that context on their own; stripping Korean of its code is no different than reinterpreting a really dense English lyric. <i>4 Walls</i> is even more accessible because f(x) songs tend to have a lot of Western cues: Many of the melodies recall songs from the American pop canon and, as with many K-pop songs, there are English lyrics spliced in throughout (at one point, Amber raps, ""I was low key/ That’s the old me/ Now there’s Top 10 honeys tryna phone me"").</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Western pop fans don’t need to be heavily invested in the K-pop world to <i>get</i> the appeal of f(x)’s music, and <i>4 Walls</i> is an enjoyable listen even for those not looking to broach the language gap. Korean is a beautiful language with long multi-syllabic words that unspool in clumps and it carries American-stylized pop melodies fluently, breaking up long vowel sounds to fit into sonic phrases. There are few better introductions to K-pop than f(x), and <i>4 Walls</i> is a strong introduction to f(x) 2.0.</p></div>"|21285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21285-4-walls/|7.3|Sheldon Pearce

The film was set to star David Carradine, Gloria Swanson, Mick Jagger, Orson Welles, Salvador Dalí, and Amanda Lear. Meanwhile, after the producers considered none other than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> was slated to compose along with contributions from the French prog-rock outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2939-magma/"">Magma</a>. Jodorowsky was given a lavish budget but the film didn't make it past its intensive pre-production stage.</p>
<p>As Frank Pavich's 2013 documentary <a href=""http://jodorowskysdune.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Jodorowsky's Dune</i></a> illustrates, Jodorowsky and his production team put a great deal of effort into storyboarding and design, with an eye for detail that would've made Stanley Kubrick blush. As it turns out, the great irony of Jodorowsky's career is that he made his most widely-felt impact with a film he never even began shooting. To this day, his work on <i>Dune</i> continues to reflect in popular cinema and culture. In a sense, his version of <i>Dune</i> died giving birth to the genre-defining films that emerged in its wake. <i>Alien</i>, for example, was written by Dan O'Bannon and of course bore the unmistakable design aesthetic of Swiss painter H.R. Giger—both of whom had been brought in for Jodorowsky's production. This backstory, of course, frames Kurt Stenzel's score to Pavich's documentary and vice-versa.</p>
<p>So many things could have gone wrong here had Stenzel attempted to encompass the pretense and grandeur of the subject at hand. ""We need to try,"" he writes in the liner notes—the implication being that we as the audience should put forth our best effort both to imagine the film Jodorowsky envisioned and to honor the scale of what he was aiming to accomplish. But Stenzel's score—which consists mainly of a bunch of analog synths that he sequenced and mixed in real time (with no additional digital sequencing)—actually requires little effort from listeners.</p>
<p>Given the psychedelic quality of Jodorowsky's most well-known films, <i>El Topo</i> and <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, it's no surprise that in the documentary the maverick Chilean director talks about wanting to mimic the effects of LSD with <i>Dune</i>. But his goals didn't stop there. Jodorowsky breathlessly <a href=""http://youtu.be/Q-oBEGF7uwE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">describes</a> how his film was to serve as a ""prophet""—not as a prophecy, but as a living, breathing entity with a consciousness of its own. ""For me,"" he declares on camera, ""<i>Dune</i> will be the coming of a God. An artistic and cinematographic God.""</p>
<p>To Stenzel's credit, although he does fall prey to a bit of reverence—most notably in passages that feature audio samples of Jodorowsky waxing poetic on what moviemaking means to him—the music doesn't strive to be anywhere near as lofty as that. Stenzel is wise to go for a more discreet, at times even whimsical, tone that supports the documentary's easygoing, storytelling structure. It's too bad that Stenzel, when he does opt to use Jodorowsky monologues, doesn't get more creative with them by chopping them up or subjecting them to effects, but the samples occur rarely and end up being incidental to the score's overall flavor anyway.</p>
<p>Charmingly, the liner notes include a list of all the synth gear Stenzel used, just in case you're interested in geeking-out. But that would be missing the point. Stenzel's score doesn't stand out so much for the tools he used to create it as much as for the choices he made while using those tools. Pavich instructed Stenzel to go for a ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>-type feel,"" and as such the predictable path would have been to mimic the wheezing, primitive synthesizer sounds that define sci-fi cinema of the '60s and '70s—sounds that now feel quaint at best and moldy at worst. Had Stenzel emulated the audacious bleeting style of, say, early Moog pioneer Richard Teitelbaum, Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer, or any number of artists from the period, he would have artificially encased this music in a temporal ambience it doesn't actually require in order to engage your attention. Ultimately, not unlike the French electronic duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"">Air</a>, Stenzel has too much creative inspiration to settle for being a stylist, and though he openly references the past, he lands with both feet firmly anchored in the present.</p>
<p>Pavich's documentary more or less consists of a string of interviews undercut with shots of old photos and storyboard drawings. Clearly then, Stenzel's job was to keep the music moving along to match whatever pace Pavich set as appropriate for the audience's patience threshold. Stenzel shifts quickly but gracefully from one motif to the next, weaving sounds in and out like a choreographer who prefers to stay offstage while guiding each ""dancer""—each new instrument, melody, textural element, or structural change—into the fray on cue. By turns dramatic, spaced-out, otherworldly, entrancing, stately, ominous, hopeful, playful, and chatty, most of the tracks on <i>Jodorowsky's Dune</i> run about a minute long and manage to cover more than one mood before they run that course. Taken as a whole, they stream by yet never feel rushed, and Stenzel establishes his dual knack for patience and economy very early on.</p>
<p>In what is perhaps this album's defining moment, a high-pitched synth line wails and echoes in a vast empty space. Stenzel gives it a character and shape not unlike those celestial bodies that appear to us via deep-space photography as giant, colorful plumes. The lone synth line segues into a live drumset, the first appearance of organic instruments and room ambience on the whole album. The drums don't last long, and soon they too meld into vaguely Middle Eastern-sounding chants before the voices grow more distressed. Then, a snarling, heavily filtered electric guitar riff that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4262-tool/"">Tool</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tja6_h4lT6A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Forty-Six &amp; 2""</a> makes its entrance before flaring out as quickly as it came. One might expect these elements to step on each other's toes. But, as with just about every other sound that leads up to this passage, Stenzel creates a sensation of smooth sailing, even as he radically alters the scenery every few minutes. On <i>Jodorowsky’s Dune</i>, Stenzel takes you across <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_Topographic_Oceans"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">topographic oceans</a> that never rock the boat.</p></div>"|21241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21241-jodorowskys-dune-ost/|8.0|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

They're designed much in the spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17361-jack-u-where-are-u-now-ft-justin-bieber/"">""Where Are Ü Now""</a>, his single with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a> from earlier this year, where Bieber's voice fluctuated through animated throbs. Produced, respectively, by MdL and Skrillex (who contributes six productions to the record), ""What Do You Mean?"" and ""Sorry"" are vivid tropical house tracks that sound like sunlight drifting down through palm fronds. Bieber's voice often resembles a breath contorted inexpressively through notes; here, he lets it weightlessly fall through textures. They are his best performances to date, allowing him to flex a rhythmic playfulness without communicating an iota of legible emotion.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Purpose</i> doesn't particularly follow up on the advances suggested by his previous release, the 2013 R&amp;B experiment <i>Journals.</i> That record was Bieber's first attempt at casting himself as an adult, but its efforts, alternately curious and anonymous, went largely unnoticed. For its part, <i>Purpose</i> mostly suggests that Bieber's idea of ""adulthood"" is the ability to convey pettiness without emotional intelligence. On new single ""Love Yourself"", an Ed Sheeran co-write that also functions as a gentle kiss-off, Bieber sings ""If you like the way you look that much/ Baby, you should go and love yourself."" Lyrically it's needlessly mean, neither funny nor clever, and it doesn't do much to justify the severity of its perspective.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The songs on </span><i>Purpose </i><span>have a similarly inanimate feeling; they seem to radiate more than they move. ""</span>No Sense"" feels oddly hookless and almost willfully ugly, and when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32825-travi-scott/"">Travis Scott</a> surfaces toward the end of the track, he registers as just another cold texture. Nothing here has the captivating, lopsided construction of <i>Journals</i>' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47YClVMlthI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Confident""</a>. ""No Pressure"", featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a>, comes close with its shimmering, processed acoustic guitars—though the song might have appeared lighter and more nimble in the hands of someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In general, vagueness, indecision, and faint befuddlement suit Bieber best. ""The Feeling"", produced by Skrillex, describes a liminal, unstable state (""Am I in love or am I in love with the feeling?""), and the track fittingly seems to slip in and out of focus. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33119-halsey/"">Halsey</a>, who released one of the worst<b> </b>singles of the year with ""New Americana"", proves an ideal counterweight to Bieber, and together the two effortlessly convey the gentle intensity of a crush. At these moments, when Bieber is allowed to remain a lithe and fluttery element zippering in and out of a canvas, he sounds most comfortable.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But when Bieber is required to slow down and emote, he sounds adenoidal and aggressively blank. ""Life Is Worth Living"", a piano ballad in which every chord seems indifferently faxed in, is one of the many songs on which Bieber struggles to justify himself to the public. ""My reputation's on the line, so I'm working on a better me,"" he sings. As much as this record is part of his long campaign of rehabilitation, he struggles to convey a remotely sympathetic perspective. His similes tend to get terrestrial when he's talking about himself: ""It's like you're stuck on a treadmill/ Running in the same place."" On the title track, he sings, ""Look at all the promises I've kept,"" as if gesturing to a PowerPoint presentation. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The second half of the album is monochromatic and depressing, especially as it runs out to 20 tracks in certain versions. (Two of the bonus tracks, ""Been You"" and ""Get Used to It"", are pneumatic, funky disco pop tracks that sound only slightly removed from this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32982-jason-derulo/"">Jason Derulo</a> album; they're better than nearly anything on the album proper.) <span id=""docs-internal-guid-25f01a12-120c-94bd-831a-9d78bc9da107"">Near the end of the album is ""Children"", an embarrassing and overwrought attempt at social consciousness. It might be an attempt at writing his own <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PivWY9wn5ps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Man in the Mirror""</a>, an outward gaze among so many shallow inward ones.</span> ""What about the children?"" he asks meaninglessly. ""Who's got the heart?"" The question hangs uneasily.</p></div>"|21248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21248-purpose/|6.2|Brad Nelson

The soulful and enigmatic crooner Jamie Woon rediscovered this in the four long years between his charming-but-uneven debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15309-mirrorwriting/""><i>Mirrorwriting</i></a>, and the release of his second, <i>Making Time</i>. Rising with a fresh crop of UK-based, slightly experimental vocalists and collaborators in the London bass music scene (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31502-sampha/"">Sampha</a>), Woon’s debut produced sophisticated music that ultimately failed to catch on as strongly as his contemporaries.</p>
<p>Like many artists in his position, Woon could have become a victim of the time, a footnote to a rising scene. But Woon took the opportunity to realign with his musical origins. In a 2011<a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-11999921"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> interview</a> with BBC, Woon said ""At the heart of what I do is R&amp;B; it’s groove-based vocal-led music."" On <i>Mirrorwriting</i> that ""R&amp;B"" was partially obscured in production atmospherics, but <i>Making Time</i> exhibits a renewed focus. The album sounds loose and organic, revealing layers of precision in the production and recording on repeated listens.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"">D'Angelo</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/""><i>Voodoo</i></a>, Woon was interested in recording with a live band in the room for <i>Making Time</i>, a far cry from the electronic-roots of his debut. ""My starting point was that I wanted to hear a funky rhythm section,"" Woon offered to Pharrell Williams in an <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/jamie-woon/87302#8Gkz8POFR2S7IdUO.99"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> on Beats 1. <i>Mirrorwriting </i>was distinguished in part by collaborations with revolutionary musician and producer Will Bevan (otherwise known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>), but <i>Making Time</i> reduces songs to their core elements: a perfect harmony, strong melodies, and a crooning voice that is unlike any other.</p>
<p>Woon's vocals are rare and stunning, the kind of sound that washes over its listeners, and no synths or heavy-handed production is needed to make that effect possible. The instruments here play supporting roles. ""Movement"" transforms halfway through its length into a groovy, throwback jam, and the slinky, snake-like bass guitar cocoons Woon’s voice without overpowering it. Later the horns gradually stomp in. Their sound is elastic and ominous, pushing and pulling against the light fluidity of Woon’s ad-libs. And on ""Sharpness"", the album’s lead single, the bass pops in and out of the song just as much as the steady drums. The result shouldn’t surprise, but still does.</p>
<p>Channeling pieces of piano jazz and folk as well as R&amp;B, <i>Making Time</i> feels philosophically similar to Jessie Ware’s restrained 2014 sophomore effort, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19913-jessie-ware-tough-love/""><i>Tough Love</i></a>. Many described the work as ""adult contemporary""—an insult, if not entirely untrue. But that sort of designation fails to engage with the work at hand, lumping it all together. And while it never hit as hard as ""Running"" on Ware’s debut, songs like ""Kind Of … Sometimes … Maybe"" and ""Champagne Kisses"" offered surprises brimming underneath the surface. It’s smart music that doesn’t beat you over the head with its intelligence. If Woon’s last album was an attempt to incorporate the contemporary sounds he favored at the time, this current album is a testament to the strength of traditional music composition: simple guitars, slinky bass lines, and sophisticated songwriting. Woon has, from the start, been his strongest when he lets his voice say everything that’s necessary. This might come across as traditionalist, but that is OK. With songs this good, little else needs to be said.</p></div>"|21163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21163-making-time/|7.4|Britt Julious

Like all fanciful realms, this hallowed spot, deemed ""the miraculous place"", honed the young von Hausswolff’s imagination like a gym for the mind. ""The border between fantasy and reality was so blurred,"" she recently <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/18971-anna-von-hausswolff-interview-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> the Quietus. As the former monarch of the woods across the street from my elementary school, I can attest to this sensation: there’s something about self-created folklore that sharpens the spirit like no other exercise can, and one could argue that such myths lay at the heart of not just childhood, but human experience as a whole.</p>
<p class=""p1"">To craft her third full-length LP—so named for her special place—von Hausswolff made a pilgrimage to the city of Piteå, home to the Acusticum Pipe Organ. One of the largest instruments of its kind in that region, it is equipped with 9,000 pipes, built-in percussion (including vibraphone and glockenspiel), recording/looping tools, and nefarious sounds produced by submerging the pipes halfway underwater. If von Hausswolff’s wanderlust is the soul of <i>The Miraculous, </i>then the Acusticum is its gothic, frequently grotesque heart, its mechanical pulse tempered by the organic approach of the musician's four-piece backing band.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Consider <i>The Miraculous</i>’ universe a carnal Camelot, not far removed from the fucked-up mythologies of Angela Carter or George R.R. Martin. There’s no Ren-Faire tackiness, though; rather, the LP bridges high fantasy with human emotion, as the opening line of ""The Hope Only of Empty Men"" attests: ""I think I see a knight/ I’m gonna fuck him for a while."" Considering the religious contexts in which we’re used to hearing the organ, such lines seem downright heretical, and that’s exactly the point: <i>The Miraculous </i>transforms an instrument regarded by many as one of the stuffiest in music into a lusty, lustrous marvel.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For instance, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>-reminiscent highlight ""Come Wander With Me / Deliverance"" pits the puritanical pipes against a pair of droning guitars and an aqueous wail created through the aforementioned pipe-submerging method. It’s a battle that ends with a noise-ridden reunion, the marriage of sacred and profane. There’s darkness embedded within the songs’ dynamics as well; as Von Hausswolff lets out an ascendant wail at the start of ""Evocation"", the pipes swell up around her like the nightmarish offspring of a THX sound test, imbuing the musician's corporeal angst with divine strength.<span style=""line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">There’s nothing wrong with a good glacial pace, but Von Hausswolff’s slowly unfurling arrangements, as well as her reliance on the organ as the primary rhythmic vehicle, occasionally make the record tough sledding. The album’s meandering latter half proves dull: ""En Ensam Vandrare"" and the title track drift along like flotsam on a lazy river, doing little to command the listener’s attention. Like most stories, <i>The Miraculous</i> take a few retellings for its ultimate magic—invigorating contrasts, medieval madness, and von Hausswolff’s role as foul-mouthed, fantastical raconteure—to sink in. Nevertheless, this is a dimension worth thorough investigation.</p></div>"|21135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21135-the-miraculous/|7.8|Zoe Camp

Even the undisputed legends of the area have never become true household names outside of their home state—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33158-too-hort/"">Too $hort</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"">E-40</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Dre"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mac Dre</a>. It’s a disheartening trend, but it’s easy to theorize about why the pattern has continued for decades. In general, Bay artists tend to like staying independent and favoring sometimes-indigestible levels of prolificacy over carefully curated releases. They also build off of their region’s existing musical traditions — sticking to their corner rather than trying to reinvent the sound of the genre. There always seems to be a gold standard of slapper already in mind—for well over a decade, it’s hinged on a handclap snare, a thin kick beating out Morse code, and a foghorn bass lick—and targeted at all times.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Charismatic 20-year-old Vallejo up-and-comer Nef the Pharaoh also holds these truths to be self-evident, and basically fits the usual bill of a regional Bay star. The young rapper gained momentum mostly through creatively covering classic beats—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdjIH4eoj8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a swaggy flip of Nas’ ""Oochie Wally""</a>—and delivering crisp neighborhood pride anthems: Last year’s muted <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usiJQz2KqKI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bitch I’m From Vallejo""</a> turned the heads of local hero Cousin Fik and his mentor and labelhead E-40.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Nef’s first release for 40’s <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SickWidItRecords/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sick Wid It Records</a> is also full of stylistic references and hat-tips, though—perhaps surprisingly for a Bay MC—mostly to idols from far outside San Francisco. Quotes from classic '90s Cash Money Records singles structured his January single ""Big Tymin’"", and the influence of this kind of music weighs heavily on the entire EP. ""Boss Me"" is based around a sing-songy bounce cadence, and Nef recycles Juvenile’s ""Ha"" line construction on his Auto-Tune-riddled twerking ode ""Meantime"". <span>Nef is contributing to what seems to be a mini-trend in post-hyphy rap toward turn-of-the-millenium Southern music these days: His tourmate, collaborator, and Heartbreak Gang sideman Kool John regularly bites Hot Boys flows (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16Qy3GOGhHE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his most recent single with Joe Moses</a> interpolates 2002 Big Tymers hit ""Get Your Roll On""), L.A. affiliate Problem </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QCXhD7uDG8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">notably</a><span> interpolated Master P and Young Bleed, and Juvenile himself hopped on the popular remix to fellow HBKer </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31412-iamsu/"" target=""_blank"">Iamsu!</a><span>’s strip club anthem </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTcoOswjkgs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""100 Grand""</a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If Kool John likes to play the Juve or Mannie role, the less laconic Nef favors Wayne. <span>Just when the likeness starts to become eerie, Nef backs off and switches hats, always with an overtly comic, lightly ironic timing, like he’s carrying off an elaborately plotted series of pranks.</span> His verses pit in-and-out-of-phase, cartoonish rambling (à la his mentor and labelhead E-40) against lilting but controlled double-time. Snap-jumps between simpering bad boy posturing in his high range (""Trips to Rome, shrimps and calzones/ I’m always outta range, I’ma text you when I get home""), a more intimidating low purr, and a diplomatic, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>-ian midrange (see introspective closer ""Come Pick Me Up"") give his verses a character-driven quality that's almost Jim Carrey-esque. <span>Luckily, this isn't a </span><i>When Nature Calls </i><span>scenario; Nef’s sensibility isn't exhausting.</span> The rapper can embody the obnoxious neighborhood bully, the smoothest game-spitter in school, and a conscientious father in one song all without spoiling the mood, or upstaging the beat.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The flow and intonation shifts as Nef pans between scenes: after-shift <i>rendezvous</i> with strippers, hustling rituals encrypted in dense slang, and more bald-faced, confessional anecdotes. He tends to pick simple governing metaphors and pushes them to logical but satisfying conclusions—in the marimba-studded nu-G-funk strut ""Michael Jackson"", most effectively, he uses an extended King of Pop metaphor to forge an elaborate tribute to designer shoe shopping.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This six-song EP does not provide a definitive answer on whether Nef is just an effective conduit for great party songs, or if he’s got a voice that’s resonant enough for a full career of albums and features. It’s a bunch of stabs in promising directions—a more ambitious extension of his earlier YouTube drops and his <a href=""http://www.thizzler.com/blog/2014/7/6/nef-the-pharaoh-richby25two-mixtape.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>#RichBy25</i> mixtape</a>. Success is ensured on the EP by the neighborhood heroes he’s got supporting him: rising talent June on Da Beat, G-Funk wizard and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/641727-DJ-Fresh-7"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">indispensible area talent scout</a> DJ Fresh, and P-Lo, HBK’s more baroque answer to DJ Mustard. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Even in the Bay—which, from Mac Dre to Shady Nate to Husalah, has birthed an untold amount of slickness—charm as strong and effortless as Nef’s doesn’t come along everyday. He may slide into other people’s flows so well that you lose track of him for a moment, but the style and grace with which he ducks and weaves between them imbues everything he does with personality. His brand of unfailingly zany energy has characterized the best hip-hop of his region for decades, and Nef’s never been ashamed to acknowledge it (""Mac motherfucking Dre lives in me,"" he claims at the beginning of last year’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diNmbuclDB4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""M.A.C.""</a>). He’s pretty good at making anything sound cool, and maybe even cleverer than it is. See his song-stealing verse on DJ Mustard's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR0llwUGQc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Know It""</a> from earlier this year, which closes out with: ""Money on my mind like a headband/ Fucking with my ‘fetti, you a dead man/ Shoot him in his chest, watch his head split/ Every day I make a band and never play the instrument.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">What he has that many of his local peers don’t is a consistent ear for hooks, a willingness to play the field stylistically without outpacing himself, and a precision of purpose. ""In the land of the lost, I’m the nigga to win,"" he claims on ""Mobbin"". With industry cosigns, a ""Big Tymin’"" remix from Cali-stars-turned-national-influencers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"">YG</a> (included here) and a national tour with the latter under his belt, Nef has a rare entry point for success beyond Solano County. If this EP is any indication, he may also have the pop prowess and adaptability to make the most of it.</p></div>"|21255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21255-nef-the-pharaoh-ep/|7.3|Winston Cook-Wilson

The music—a spare backbeat and bass guitar lollygag, busied by skittish piano runs and a modest choral section—belies the ragged, bemused delivery of an artist reflecting on his time as a journeyman power-pop artist on Stiff Records in the late 1970s. ""If I’d known then, what I know now,"" goes the chorus—but it’s a tease. He stops and snickers at the temptation. That nimble maneuver—to reminisce, but jettison nostalgia—makes it a great opener for <i>amERICa, </i>an album rooted in classicist rock gestures but fixated on the contemporary United States.</p>

And peers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5344-nick-lowe/"">Nick Lowe</a> memorably looked at the era’s intersection of fandom and commerce in songs such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn4AOQeiR0w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Love My Label""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI5ofPLKFps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rollers Show""</a>, too. But Goulden’s return to the show business theme—which, perhaps because it seemed crass in the wake of punk, faded from rock lyricism forever and today thrives in rap—acknowledges the chasm of time between then and now. With distance, he gains lucidity.</p>
<p>It’s the same with the Englishman’s observations of the United States, which are dappled in telling detail and really rather astute. ""White Bread"", for instance, looks at the normalized delusions of a Middle America gun nut. On the rustic ""Sysco Trucks"", Goulden hovers over the wholesale food business: remote diners, kitchens, and markets all stocked with the same goods. There’s a critique implied, if not of capitalism at large then at least of monopoly and its subtly unsettling consequences for common cuisine. As he lightly notes, ""Everything we’re eating comes from somewhere."" The slaphappy typography ""<i>amERICa"" </i>is a bad indicator of Goulden’s tone; he’s mistily allusive, often playful, but never ham-fisted.</p>
<p>Wreckless Eric recorded <i>amERICa </i>at home in upstate New York. He played many of the instruments himself. The palm-muted guitars and roaring refrains of his old work remain, but the record is more reserved and instilled with zany, fanciful flourishes. Goulden rarely grasps for big, beaming hooks. Instead, reverse reverb and spectral keys temper his creaky, pliable voice. And that blurred, homespun atmosphere makes <i>amERICa </i>sound modern; it puts him in league with bedroom revivalists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5515-home-blitz/"">Home Blitz</a>, who ply weirder, less commercially aspirant versions of Wreckless Eric’s classic power-pop sound.</p>
<p>Many artists of Wreckless Eric’s era and tradition have imitators, but few of yesteryear’s outliers can catch up with their descendants, let alone best them. <i>amERICa </i>is that rare record. Goulden is grownup, with all of the stereotypical benefits: an air of wisdom, emotional texture, and, perhaps most cliché of all, a seasoned voice. And yet, <i>amERICa </i>isn’t complacent or satisfied; Wreckless Eric anatomizes his surroundings with the wide-eyed thrill of discovery. His American flyover reveals simmering cultural disturbances and essential beauty alike—a late capitalist hellscape beneath ""Bobbie Gentry’s Mississippi skies.""</p></div>"|21141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21141-america/|7.7|Sam Lefebvre

Mostly they’ve let any criticisms about their originality bounce right off of them. Instead of trying to prove themselves more than the sum of their record collections, they’ve simply continued showing off how vast those record collections are. 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15270-belong/""><i>Belong</i></a> expanded on their debut’s C86 jangle with blood-rushing alternative rock, while last year’s understated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19335-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart-days-of-abandon/""><i>Days of Abandon</i></a> took an even deeper tour through the Hall of Semi-Obscure UK College Rock than their debut did.</p>
<p>That tour continues on their new <i>Hell</i> EP. It’s one of the band’s most low-stakes releases yet: an original song, which band leader Kip Berman first posted as a demo along with several songs that didn’t make the cut for <i>Days of Abandon</i>, and two quick covers. In hindsight, he might have done well to find room for <i>Hell</i>'s title track on <i>Days of Abandon</i>; its chipper spirit would have helped lighten an album that sometimes begged for a pick-me-up. Like nearly every Pains of Being Pure at Heart track, it’s obsessively specific in its influences, with a sticky disco groove that nods to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"">Orange Juice</a> and the puppy-dog giddiness of an early Close Lobsters single. Even Berman's vocals feel like an homage; he sings in a warbled sigh that sounds a lot like <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/8086-pete-shelley/"">Pete Shelley</a>.</p>
<p>Given how openly the band has always embraced their influences, it’s surprising they haven’t recorded more covers—Berman often seems to be channeling other artists’ voices and accents anyway, so it’s not much of a leap to sing their words, too. Each of <i>Hell</i>’s covers serve as a statement of taste. One celebrates one of the quintessential overlooked British guitar-pop bands <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1596-felt/"">Felt</a>’s “Ballad of the Band”, while the other reclaims a familiar if underappreciated hit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2163-james/"">James</a>’ “Laid”, a treasure of a song that lost much of its cache when the <i>American Pie</i> franchise claimed it as its own.</p>
<p>Both are too faithful to offer any real surprises, and the band’s last album already owed so much to Felt that their “Ballad of the Band” almost feels redundant. “Laid” delivers more of a kick. Their version doesn’t quite capture the orgasmic glee of James’ original, but it features a game lead vocal turn from <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5171-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow"">A Sunny Day in Glasgow</a> singer Jen Goma, who’s been moonlighting with Pains since their recent lineup shakeup. Unlike Berman, she’s not afraid to leave her own stamp on her cover, and she punctuates the song’s most biting line with just the right amount of a punk snarl: “Dye my eyes and call me pretttttttty.”</p>
<p>Pains’ debut album introduced a band that had not only clearly mastered their influences, but seemed on the brink of doing something truly new with them. Six years later, it’s now clear they have no interest in that; Berman is too reverentially devoted to his muses to risk bastardizing them. When a band’s output is this consistently pleasant, it's petty to complain too much about originality, but <i>Hell</i> is the group’s second overly safe release in a row, and it’s hard not to wish they’d start taking a few more chances. This band is talented enough to be aiming much higher.</p></div>"|21261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21261-hell-ep/|5.5|Evan Rytlewski

To a nearly surreal extent, every meaningful aspect of living in New York is inverted there, like some kind of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> opposite-land paradise–a place of endless cars and infinite residential square footage, where generalized anxiety is something to be worked on rather than bragged about and people seem to enjoy going to bed at a reasonable hour.</span></p>
<p>Despite all the breathless endorsements from transplants that swear that they've never felt so good before, L.A. does have a substantial dark side–a populace dealing with PTSD after years of gang violence compounded by police violence, the reactionary paranoia wafting in from Orange County, its ongoing ecological disaster. It's a place where you can stand in the window of a multimillion dollar loft downtown and gaze out over an ephemeral shanty town that blooms and evaporates daily, cocktail in hand, feeling like nothing so much as a sci-fi villain.</p>
<p>After producing a convincingly jittery, grimy portrait of late-Bloomberg New York on 2013's <i>NYC, Hell 3:00 AM</i>, James Ferraro has accomplished a similar likeness of his adopted hometown Los Angeles with its follow-up, <i>Skid Row</i>. It comes as no surprise that his L.A. album is short on sunshine and mellow vibes, and long on looming existential dread. There's not much of New L.A. in his portrait, no bohemian Brooklyn expats chillaxing in a pleasant new climate. Ferraro's L.A. is a dystopian vision stitched together from its drought-stricken everyone's-a-reality-show present and the bad old '90s, where the riots, the OJ trial, and the LAPD's corrupt culture blurred together to cast an ominous shadow on the city's carefully cultivated image.</p>
<p>His urban pessimism remains undulled–as does his passion for oppressively ugly recording techniques–but Ferraro's switched up some of his musical approach. While <i>Hell 3:00 AM</i> sounded like a nightmare version of contemporary R&amp;B, <i>Skid Row</i> does something similar with L.A.'s native funk styles, which have recently been revived in less bleak ways by the likes of Flying Lotus and Kendrick Lamar.</p>
<p>Ferraro's take on funk strips away all of its organic sensuality and joy, leaving a creepy husk that's still fascinating to inspect. ""White Bronco"", which kicks off the record after one of the computer-generated spoken word introductions that have become something of a Ferraro trademark–this one featuring a pair babbling about gated communities and ""burning Priuses on the highway"" and conducting a transaction for an iced latte–slows a slow-jam groove down even slower until it sounds eerily narcotized and its minimalist synth bass riff takes on a menacing aspect. Ferraro's monotone listing of facts from the Nicole Brown Simpson murder trial mixed in with samples of TV news surrounding the Rodney King beating conflate the two sensational acts of violence like someone who's either heavily intoxicated or just suffered a head injury. At the two-thirds point of the song, Ferraro hits a vocal lick that sounds like Snoop's ""'G' Thang"" flow, and it feels like some kind of sick punchline.</p>
<p>Ferraro's freer with hooks on <i>Skid Row</i> than he was on <i>Hell 3:00 AM</i>, and there are songs like ""Thrash Escalate"" and ""Rhinestones"" that sound like they could slap if they were sped up a few percent. He might be starting to come to terms with his innate pop talents, or it could just be a new tactic of dispensing hints of traditional pop pleasures into the gloom to keep his audience off balance.</p>
<p><i>Skid Row</i> isn't really about those singular moments though, or about walking away from it with a hook stuck in your head. They're just elements in a solidly built cohesive whole that feels like a J.G. Ballard novel filtered through late-night Ableton sessions, and a worthy addition to the long line of punk albums about Los Angeles that render it as a city built on fantasy with a nihilistic streak that runs to its core.</p></div>"|21225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21225-skid-row/|6.6|Miles Raymer

Her coming out party, which came in the form of the loner anthem “Here,” exposed a receptive world to a soulful R&amp;B sound. Cara’s lament about a less-than-enjoyable party made her a poster child for Introvert Nation at a time when shyness—thanks to <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts?language=en"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writers like Susan Cain</a> and <a href=""http://www.dose.com/theworld/24343/Experience-What-Being-An-Introvert-Is-Truly-Like-With-These-17-Pictures/?utm_source=FBTraffic&amp;utm_medium=apollo&amp;utm_campaign=CMfacebook"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">various</a> <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-introverts-tips-for-minimizing-wedding-stress_5640a654e4b0307f2cadfbcb?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">digital</a> <a href=""http://www.stevenaitchison.co.uk/blog/10-things-you-absolutely-should-know-before-you-fall-in-love-with-an-introvert/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">media</a> <a href=""http://www.thatscoop.com/harsh.pawar/signs-of-introvert"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">outlets</a> — has been recast as an identity unto itself.</p>
<p>Def Jam, Cara’s label, soon released more of her songs, several of them country-tinged pop that recall artists like Taylor Swift and Haim. In Cara’s case, that sound tends to go hand in hand with bland, vaguely “rebellious” lyrics. In the pop songs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21074-four-pink-walls-ep/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">her <i>Four Pink Walls</i> EP</a>—including the potential megahits “Seventeen” and “I’m Yours”—Cara’s appealing personality is sometimes hard to unearth from under the layers of pop gloss that have been poured on top of her.</p>
<p>But the EP seems to have been what the label was looking for, at least as evidenced by the fact that its five songs have been transposed onto the front of Cara’s debut album, <i>Know-It-All, </i>in the same order, with very few changes made. The speed at which Cara is being groomed and prompted to put out new releases feels distasteful if sadly not unfamiliar, something like an AAU prospect being coaxed to go pro before he’s entirely ready.</p>
<p>In many ways, though, Cara is ready. Her winning personality shines in recent public appearances (<a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/alessia-cara-brings-anti-party-anthem-here-to-seth-meyers-20151112"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">watch her slay “Here” on “Late Night on Seth Meyers</a>”), and her voice, with its warmth and character, can transform a so-so song into something far more compelling. She’s able to mine an otherwise simple ballad like “Stone,” from the second half of <i>Know-It-All</i>, as if it were a rich emotional deposit, bringing pathos even to a bland line like, “I think I think too much.”</p>
<p>Though “Stone” is the only song that explicitly features Sebastian Kole, he contributed plenty as one of the album’s producers and a co-writer. Kole, who has been in the factory songwriting system for a little while now also makes his own music. Two things jump out at a first-time listener: his gorgeous voice and painful earnestness. That helps explain why he’s helped construct such compelling vocal showcases for Cara, but also why her punchiness has been overtaken by something more cuddly. (“Wild Things,” which transforms Cara’s grousing into a lame children’s book reference is the most obvious example.)</p>
<p>A <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/arts/music/alessia-cara-speaks-up-for-the-outsiders-on-here.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Times</i> profile of Cara</a> from May reveals something of Kole’s approach. As a songwriting exercise, he compelled Cara to write confessionals as if they were meant for no one but her — and then email them to him. The sound of those emails may well be reflected in the soppy ballad “Stars.” “I need you, baby I need to, let down my guard, and give you my scars/ Open up my heart and we could be stars,” she sings. It’s easy to see how this form of diaristic writing could be confused with the honesty that made “Here” such a winner. But writing from the heart does not automatically imbue lyrics with depth.</p>
<p>Never is it more apparent that the factory approach is not allowing Cara to fulfill her potential than on “Scars To Your Beautiful.” The first verse is so arresting that I’m tempted to just quote it in full. It’s about a woman who deeply wishes to be beautiful and feels that she isn’t. The verse ends on a showstopping, deeply upsetting line: “She tries to cover up her pain, and cut her woes away/ Cause covergirls don’t cry after their face is made."" It is frustrating, though sadly inevitable given <i>Know-It-All’s </i>tendencies, that the chorus then reverts to uplifting pablum. The hook forces itself not only to redeem the devastation of the verse, but to do so cloyingly, without any kind of subtlety or empathy for the subject it rendered so well.</p>
<p>The industry has always wanted its pop stars to be all things to all people, and it’s easier to be kind and inspiring than it is to write songs that can be difficult to hear. But generality is the enemy of good songwriting, which, on some level, Cara clearly knows. She urged her label to release “Here” as a debut single and thankfully they listened. As she gets older, her voice should get stronger, on her own songs, and in fighting to get the right ones made.</p></div>"|21247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21247-know-it-all/|5.5|Jonah Bromwich

When the label issued its first vinyl box set in conjunction with its 10th anniversary in 2011, Cory Rayborn—Three Lobed’s owner, a lawyer by day—joked of the operation’s at-home modesty <a href=""http://threelobed.com/tlr/tlr080.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">by way of a sales pitch</a>. “In this case,” he wrote of his staff, “‘we’ means one human and three feline assistants.”</p>
<p>Since the release of that collection, the excellent <i>Not the Spaces You Know, but Between Them</i>, Three Lobed has continued unabated with its curatorial quest through the weird annals of experimental American folk, drone, and rock. The pace has been methodical, with four or so albums a year, but the execution masterful. In that span, Three Lobed has served as a syndicate for some of the world’s best, relatively young solo guitarists—Chuck Johnson, William Tyler, Sir Richard Bishop, and Tom Carter. There’s been shambling, snarling folk-rock from Wooden Wand, impish permutations of folk and metal from Horseback. Three Lobed issued one of the decade’s most transfixing drone records—<a href=""http://threelobed.com/tlr/tlr071.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>On Jones Beach</i>, a bagpipe-anchored collaboration between members of the Necks and Sonic Youth</a>—in 2012, followed by two essential collections from Bardo Pond, the free Philadelphia spirits that prompted Rayborn to launch Three Lobed in the first place. For an imprint so smitten with noisy records, Three Lobed’s actual signal-to-noise ratio remains nearly perfect.</p>
<p>Still, four years and all those accomplishments later, Three Lobed’s operations remain minimal, with Rayborn and his cats working away in the basement after-hours. The small scale seems by now a point of pride, a way to show that the persistent dedication of one person can help shape an entire scene. Indeed, such modesty and minimalism offer significant returns for the roster of <i>Parallelogram</i>, Three Lobed’s second vinyl set and a collection of 10 acts so strong it would feel like a fever dream for most any avant imprint. Bardo Pond splits a full-length with Yo La Tengo, Six Organs of Admittance one with William Tyler. Transatlantic and trans-generational kindred spirits Michael Chapman and Hiss Golden Messenger face off, while Kurt Vile and Steve Gunn back one another up on sides of their own. And for the five-record set’s white-hot point of dissonance and bedlam, Thurston Moore and John Moloney duel as the duo Caught on Tape while Chris Corsano, Alan Bishop and Bill Orcutt crash, clatter and grind as a trio. <i>Parallelogram </i>presents a constellation of explorers, separately ferrying the same enthusiasm and openness that have animated Three Lobed’s very catalog.   </p>
<p>Almost every act here<i> </i>has experience with a much larger label. In Sonic Youth, of course, Thurston Moore made major waves by moving to a major label a quarter-century ago, while Michael Chapman issued <i>Rainmaker</i> on Harvest Records during the company’s first year, the same year they issued<i> </i>Pink Floyd’s <i>Ummagumma</i>. Four have deals on Matador, two on Merge, one on Drag City and so on. Some of these bands may sell more records in a week of touring than Rayborn sells of all his releases combined in a year.</p>
<p>But these five splits are available <a href=""http://threelobed.com/tlr/parallelogram.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">only in an edition of about 950 LPs.</a> Through the label, they’re offered only as a buy-them-all bundle, though stores and the bands themselves will be able to sell individual titles. Coupled with those low numbers and a relatively high barrier to entry, Three Lobed’s low-key status and individual-driven aesthetic seem to have made each act comfortable, or free and clear to try something different out of their typical spotlight. As William Tyler, who continues his recent streak of austere wonder with his two contributions here,<a href=""http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2015/09/30/six-organs-of-admittance-william-tyler-parallelogram/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> put it in an early interview about <i>Parallelogram</i></a>, “I pretty much say yes to anything Cory suggests. He is a number one ace dude, like a Yogi Berra-type figure in the subterranean rock scene.” Everyone on <i>Parallelogram</i> seems to respond to that same why-not directive.</p>
<p>Yo La Tengo, for instance, shows a piece of their collectively complex musical mind rarely seen in a recording studio; their “Electric Eye” is a fierce 20-minute improvisation, with stalled signals, scraping guitars, and muffled, murmured vocals fighting against a militantly loping rhythm. Its counterpart is Bardo Pond’s “Screen for a Catch (Fur Bearing Eyes)”, a sidelong beauty that seems to funnel almost every strength of their catalogue into one arcing collage. They move from bleary-eyed stoner drift to howling-guitar psychedelia, from seraphic harmonies to acoustic-slide tangents, closing with a high-and-mighty jam that fades into the middle distance. It’s like a patchwork homage to a label that exists only because they do.</p>
<p>And just two months after releasing the biggest album of his career, Kurt Vile pounds the piano keys through Randy Newman’s “Pretty Boy”, a song that’s a bar fight waiting to happen. You can almost picture Vile, a tumbler of brown liquor in his hand, singing it this way at a bar after a show, offering it as send-up to casual new fans who might have quaked his perpetual mellow. And when he digs into heartland country for a cover of John Prine’s gleefully apologetic “Way Back Then”, he sounds carefree, temporarily leaving behind his cool for a moment as an earnest balladeer.</p>
<p>Steve Gunn adds guitar to that cover, and Vile returns the favor for Gunn’s faithful and steely-eyed cover of Nico’s “60/40.” More intriguing, though, is “Spring Garden”, a 10-minute fantasy featuring Gunn, Vile and harpist Mary Lattimore on piano. In the last few years, Gunn has morphed from a guitarist issuing long-form, dexterous instrumentals through Three Lobed to a proper singer-songwriter and bandleader. But just a few months ahead of his own big Matador debut, Gunn attempts to reconcile both past and present with this extended beauty. The trio delights in seemingly infinite refractions of a riff without distracting from Gunn’s soft-focus hook.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, Rayborn intended these pairings to highlight interesting, perhaps overlooked similarities between sets of artists he treasures. And that approach works. Hearing Six Organs of Admittance and William Tyler on the same LP, for example, you notice how well both manage density, or the lack thereof, as a discrete aspect of dynamics. Tyler’s stunning “Southern Living” begins as a bucolic duet for acoustic guitar and sighing slide. But he slowly lets the notes hang until the space can handle no more sound, until it all blurs into a messy web he then must pull apart. Likewise, in the gorgeously distorted “Lsha”, Chasny piles layers into the mix—his ghostly vocals and rapid fretwork, broken keyboards and whirring synthesizers—until it merges into one signal. He then drifts from the din, arriving at chords so soft and pretty they sound like bedside whispers.</p>
<p>But the ultimate takeaway of <i>Parallelogram</i> might be the tension among all these acts, not their similarities. Compare the guitar elegance of Tyler or Chapman, especially on the latter’s stunning “Stockport Monday (Homage Tom Rush)”, to the six-string aggression of Moore. Here, he takes a familiar riff—in this case, the pinging theme of his “Ono Soul”—and twists, turns and tackles it in every way he can. Feedback and static, squeals and divebombs: Moore searches for new ways to destroy his own melody. Usually so solemn, Hiss Golden Messenger seems to bask in the springtime sun during a delicate, groove-heavy take on J.J. Cale’s blushing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qAK7zylYgk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Wish I Had Not Said That”.</a> He adds a lightness of soul at which the original only hinted. Corsano, Bishop, and Orcutt, on the other hand, torture <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qAK7zylYgk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jack Bruce’s soft-rock flop “Politician”,</a> turning its creepy come-on into an off-putting, oft-hilarious fuck-you. The cumulative effect of all these lines—parallel, perpendicular, divergent—is one of sheer wonder. </p>
<p>There was a time not to long ago—when it became clear that most every act, no matter how large or small, could release their own records online—that people questioned what role, if any, labels might play in music’s future. Why would someone need an imprint if they could simply convince friends and fans to share a file or link? In many cases, that has come to fruition, allowing for the emergence of trends that might have been bypassed by the old, slow system. But labels aren’t just big businesses. They are, as in the case of Three Lobed, people with a long-standing dedication to a sound they want to push into the world. And their involvement in those scenes can help connect dots or create ideas, turning strange potential scenarios into five-record box sets that create new contexts for familiar acts. More than curation or tastemaking or filtering, the usual quasi-canards invoked for label survival, their real source of staying power might be their ability to invest in, understand, and help evolve a niche. For the last 15 years, that’s what Three Lobed has done. <i>Parallelogram </i>is a trove of evidence, fit for a label too big for a suburban basement.</p></div>"|20588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20588-parallelogram/|8.4|Grayson Haver Currin

The Queens, N.Y. trio (and sometimes ""y"" quartet, counting Jarobi) is one of the most revered acts in hip-hop—and with good reason. As part of the Afrocentric and innovative Native Tongues collective—which included De La Soul,  Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, Black Sheep, and others—they created and refined a template for '90s hip-hop that was street-astute, worldly, and more inspirational than aspirational. </span><span><br class=""kix-line-break""/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Even without the Native Tongues' legacy, Tribe's heritage is not a light one. There's no stretch in saying that, without A Tribe Called Quest, the biggest rap artists of this year—Drake, Future, and Kendrick Lamar—would not exist as they do. Drake would not be Drake without Kanye West's </span><i>808s and Heartbreak</i><span>; Kanye would not be Kanye without his Tribe influences. Without Tribe, the Dungeon Family—birthplace of Outkast, Goodie Mob, and Future—arguably does not exist. And the improvisational looseness of Kendrick's opus is unthinkable without the innumerable branches of jazz and hip-hop sprouting from Tribe's experimentation, which differed significantly from the cooler jazz-sample leanings of Stetsasonic and Gang Starr. There's no Mos Def, no J. Cole, no Common, no J Dilla, no Digable Planets, no Neptunes, and no Clipse as we know them. Tribe is </span><i>that</i><span> important. And this album—the first ever to receive a perfect ""5 Mic"" rating from <i>The</i> <i>Source</i> magazine—is where it all began.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Arriving a year after De La Soul's</span><i> 3 Feet High and Rising</i><span>, </span><i>People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm</i><span> showed Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and Jarobi to be whimsical yet grounded in reality. They weren't heady, hermetic, and puzzling like De La; in comparison to</span><i> 3 Feet High</i><span>'s astounding range and informative sound collages, </span><i>People's Instinctive Travels</i><span> was clean and focused. Where De La went wide musically, Tribe went deep; where De La was deep and dense lyrically, Tribe went wide and abstract. That both projects managed to do all they were able to do and remain fun is one of the great wonders of hip-hop's first golden age.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Encountered now, in 2015,  </span><i>A People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm</i><span> feels like a palette cleanser. Considered with Kendrick Lamar's layered and angsty self-examination on </span><i>To Pimp A Butterfly</i><span>, the blunting and numbing escapist bounce of Future's </span><i>DS2</i><span>, and Drake's bombastic and moody mythological affirmations from </span><i>If You're Reading This It's Too Late</i><span>, it's an album that's largely focused outside of itself and its creators. There are three added cuts for this reissue—remixes by Pharrell, J. Cole, and CeeLo—that are passable and melodic but unneeded. Tribe's music needs no updating, even when it sticks out like a sore thumb, because that's exactly what it did in 1990.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""I Left My Wallet In El Segundo"", with its eight-bar flip of the Chamber Brothers' ""Funky"" and Wes Anderson-like narrative, is sparse and simple. But it more than stands up, thanks in no small part to Bob Power's remastering, which makes everything sound fuller and crisper and which uses the empty space between the newly clarified sounds to create groove and warmth. On a fresh listen, the reason ""Bonita Applebum"" (powered largely by a generous  sample of  Ramp's ""Daylight"") is still considered one the best loved songs hip-hop has ever produced becomes clear—musically it's sunny and spry, capturing blushes of virgin courtship. It's objectifying, but respectful; cocksure but awkward; flattering and freaky: Q-Tip praises his desired's ""elaborate eyes,"" promises to ""kiss you where some brothers won't"" and offers that, ""So far, I hope you like rap songs.""</span><span><br class=""kix-line-break""/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The rhymes here are at once conversational and repressed, the topics concurrently large and small. Diet is tackled on ""Ham 'N' Eggs"" with Tip and Phife rhyming in tandem, ""A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?/ Some veggie links and some fish that stinks/ Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house/ Smelled like she conjured up a mouse. "" Sexual fidelity and STD's are dealt with on ""Pubic Enemy"" via ""Old King Cole"" who ""wore the crown but not the jimmy hat"" until one day ""the fair maiden in the royal bedroom/ Caught the king scratching."" Sex and safe sex were at the forefront of Q-Tip's mind—props (women) are referred to often, and the most important thing about retrieving his wallet from El Segundo seems to be reclaiming his ""props' numbers"" and condoms, or ""jimmy hats.""</span><span><br class=""kix-line-break""/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-48e07cf7-fd48-43b0-5bb9-0f9b872fd629""><span>The group is marked for their social consciousness, but not merely because of their awareness, but their ability to wax simultaneously about politics and art. On ""Push It Along"", Tip traverses police brutality, community unity, and rap dreams in a few bars, managing to be an approachable advocate for responsibility without seeming didactic: ""The pigs are wearing blue/ And in a year or two/  We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe / What we gonna do? Save me and my brothers?/ Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers?/ Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule rap/ We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?""

The group winks at the project's inherent adult-contempo cheese-factor with their moniker, but really, this is is the best freshest, and funkiest adult-contempo cheese imaginable. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The best thing about Cool Uncle is the fact that both participants don't strain to sound new. Instead, they lean into their respective strengths. Given Splash's resume as a producer and arranger of R&amp;B sounds (as well as his frontman work for funk group Plantlife) there's a ton of groove on this album, interspersed with horns (the saxophone on the Mayer Hawthorne-featured ""Game Over"" is a highlight) and a bassist that does yeoman's work. The project is off-kilter and odd in appealing ways: On ""My Beloved"" Caldwell executes what has to be the first vampire lovesong by way of a week-long bender in Ibiza and sticks the landing. And his voice hasn't aged a day since the '70s.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The record is bursting with features, and most everyone carries their weight. Jessie Ware (on album standout ""Breakaway"") and former '80s-pop-star (""Let's Hear It For The Boy"")-turned gospel-artist Deniece Williams (""Breaking Up"") both contribute passionate performances whereas Cee-Lo (on ""Mercy"") kind of fades into the background. Mayer Hawthorne, whose blue-eyed soul vocals tend to waver somewhere between ""convincing"" and ""nah"", sounds as smooth and appealing as he ever has on ""Game Over"". </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This release, coupled with solid 2015 output from acts like The Foreign Exchange, Dawn Richard, Estelle, Kelela and others, serve as a solid reminder that R&amp;B is big and vital enough right now these days to contain multitudes: Soundcloud divas, alt-R&amp;B weirdos, returning legends like Janet, pubescent lotharios, minimalist bleep-bloop-ass whisper-singers, and beyond. Being an R&amp;B fan right now means never having to settle for one kind of record, or one sound. When one year gives you so many different options, a fun record that doesn't take itself seriously like <i>Cool Uncle</i> feels like icing. <br/></span></p></div>"|21271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21271-cool-uncle/|7.5|Ernest Wilkins

The variances between his works may seem incremental, but line them all up and the amount of raw material he's turned to gold is remarkable. This kind of mastery means there are no minor releases in his discography, at least in terms of quality. Even the two records collected here<span>—</span>the 2007 live CD <i>Norberg</i> and the 2010 7-inch <i>Apondalifa</i>, both made in limited quantities to coincide with Australian tours<span>—</span>reach levels of interest and intensity below which Hecker seems incapable of falling.</p>
<p>How exactly <i>Norberg/Apondalifa</i> fits in his stellar discography is a trickier question. Most reviews of Hecker's records compare them to their predecessors, with good reason; his oeuvre forms an internal dialogue wherein individual albums reflect, react to, and play off of each other. But even though ""Norberg"" and ""Apondalifa"" reflect the headspace Hecker was in when Hecker made, they feel isolated, meant to stand alone. And where many Hecker albums have had specific focus—on a theme, or a working method, or a mood—these two pieces are more like simple displays of creative strength.</p>
<p>Of the pair, ""Norberg"" is more comprehensive, a seamless 20-minute piece in which Hecker surfs around the sonic map without deviating far from his initial path. At times he flirts with aggressive noise; in other places he gets so beatific it's like he's meditating. But for most of ""Norberg"", Hecker skates in the tantalizing space between those poles, hinting at both without dropping off into either. When the piece ends in applause from the crowd, it's almost shocking, because—as in much of Hecker's work—you feel like you've spent the last 20 minutes inside of his head.</p>
<p>Perhaps because it's shorter, the 9-minute ""Apondalifa"" is more single-minded, hewing to one discernible range of mood. But Hecker can blow up even the tiniest dots into widening vistas, a feat he accomplishes here by varying textures rather than his tones. So even as the track feels relentless, it also spreads out into phasing guitar chords, low-end rumbles, and slow waves of drone that circle a solid core. As important as those details are, in a way they're also irrelevant, because Hecker's touch and control are so deft they could transform any coal into diamonds. That's the ultimate value of <i>Norberg/Apondalifa</i>, a sharp reminder that Tim Hecker has had it all figured out for a while now.</p></div>"|21217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21217-norbergapondalifa/|7.6|Marc Masters

And yet, their music continues to find new listeners, whether through compilations, car commercials, soundtrack placements, or G+ copies of <i>Eldorado</i> in used record bins. On one hand, the band ought to have aged about as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7953-emerson-lake-and-palmer/"">Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer</a> or Styx, which is to say, not very well. ELO’s best albums— <i>A</i> <i>New World Record</i> and <i>Discovery</i> in particular—are prime examples of the excesses of the '70s, with all the pomp and studio wankery of the most ambitious prog rock imaginable. And yet, Lynne deployed those techniques in service of songs that had all the exuberance and abandon of early rock 'n' roll. If he was making big statements, then they typically amounted to ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/Up4WjdabA2c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I really want tonight to last forever / I really wanna be with you</a>."" </p>
<p>Given their propensity for cosmic imagery (have you seen their <a href=""http://jefflynneselo.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">web site</a>?), the title of their latest album sounds all the more wistful, as though the absence of alien life is the saddest thing Lynne could ever imagine. That particular melancholy informs first single and album opener ""When I Was a Boy"", which may sound slight but is animated by the kind of nostalgia often found in country songs. ""Radio waves kept me company in those beautiful days when there was no money,"" Lynne sings, as though flipping through old photo albums. ""When I was a boy, I had a dream."" He’s still no wordsmith, but there’s something bracing about his directness; any lyrical pretensions would ruin the reverie.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On the other hand, you have something like ""Dirty to the Bone"". With its florid harps and thrumming drums, it’s an upbeat pop song in tone and tempo. But the lyrics are mean-spirited to a near-comical degree, as Lynne describes one of those she-devils who seem to exist only in old rock songs: ""She’ll mess you up, she’ll move around… she’ll deceive you till the cows come home."" That kind of cartoony straw-woman writing abounded in the '70s, but the casual misogyny, not to mention such threadbare cliché, feels profoundly out of place now. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Alone in the Universe</i> fares best when Lynne is more generous, when he can contrast the downcast sentiments of the lyrics with the effervescence of the music. After a rocky side 1, side 2 picks up considerably, thanks to light-speed ""Ain’t It a Drag"" and the zero-gravity ""I’m Leaving You."" Lynne may be a maximalist, but he makes every element count. He still has a good ear for simple but driving rhythm sections, and most of these songs use an acoustic strum to augment the beat and warm the track—a familiar, but still effective, technique. Likewise, the sympathetic backing vocals on ""All My Life"" underscore the yearning in the songs, making the simplicity of the lyrics (""I’m so glad I found you, just want to be around you"") sound all the sweeter.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Alone in the Universe</i><span> doesn’t simply unearth that classic ELO sound like some ancient artifact. Instead, it gently updates those elements to 2015, the year Lynne celebrates his 68th birthday and his 52nd year in the music business. These songs sound precarious, both musically and emotionally. Partly that is due to age and the slight quaver in Lynne’s vocals, which aren’t quite as robust as they used to be. Partly it is due to technology. Lynne has always used to the studio to define his band’s entire identity, and the difference between then and now is the difference between the air-brushed UFO on <i>A</i> </span><span><i>New World Record</i> </span><span>and the CGI saucer on </span><i>Alone in the Universe</i><span>. There’s a gauzy thinness to the sound, an inescapable two-dimensionality that occasionally hinders Lynne’s mission. Still</span><span>, </span><span>this is a fine addition to their catalog, perhaps not as consistent as 2001’s </span><i>Zoom</i><span> but much better than these late-career revival albums tend to sound. </span></p></div>"|21266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21266-alone-in-the-universe/|6.3|Stephen M.

Back in the early 2000s, Balis and Cho met at Vassar College and began making house singles as a duo. Years later, they added vocalist Adeline Michèle, and a 17-piece live band to the mix at their shows. <i>Animal Nature</i> isn’t a huge departure from their debut; the production is cleaner, and there’s a bit less funk in the mix. This is a more polished, less-DIY affair than 2011’s debut, something you can see even in the cover artwork: on their self-titled, Michèle goofed off in a parking lot, but 2015 Escort seems to have found its brand identity, and it looks alluring in neon.</p>

Eavesdropping on Cobain has been a lurid national pastime for nearly 20 years now, from 2003's <i>Journals</i> to the scraps collected on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5811-with-the-lights-out/""><i>With the Lights Out</i></a> box, but Morgen took us closer than even the most brazen imagined we should be allowed to go: Courtney and Kurt, naked and bantering in the bathroom on home video about who gets to play the Reading Festival that year (Courtney, pregnant with Frances, complains jokingly about having to stay home and “get big and fat”). Cobain, nodding off and holding his toddler. Footage of the three band members, teenagers, thrashing around in an Aberdeen shack, watched by two profoundly bored audience members. The very idea that this footage <i>exists</i>, and that we might be given such unfettered access to it, lends the film an uneasy voyeuristic charge.</p>
<p><i>Montage of Heck: The Home Recordings </i>carries the same unsavory aftertaste as the film, with none of its attendant illuminations. The scraps here were dredged by Morgen and used to wallpaper the film, and he’s rounded them out with some home recordings that didn’t make the movie. Home tapes by iconic artists are a tricky business. They can be <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/John-Lennon-Johns-Lost-Home-Demos-Vol-1/release/4353360"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">revelatory</a>, but they always carry a question: Did we learn enough to justify the intrusion? In the context of the film, the audio was an essential part of the film’s sometimes-unclean sense of immersion. Divorced from the images, the sounds on these tapes are little more than lint emptied out of the last pocket of a life.</p>
<p>""Kurt’s brain was always on,” his sister Kim says early in the film, and <i>Home Recordings</i> sounds exactly like that: What a brain is like when it is <i>on</i>, but not necessarily thinking anything. It’s not like listening to Kurt Cobain’s music; it is like submerging yourself in (what you imagine to be) his mind, with all of the bored fidgets, silly voices, jokes made to oneself, and half-hearted guitar strums this implies. In the film, his first girlfriend Tracy Marander recalls that while Cobain was living with her, he was unemployed and would watch television for hours, strumming his guitar abstractedly. You can imagine that a few of these tracks were recorded in similar states. “Burn the Rain” could have been a song he never finished, or it could just be a blurry version of a bunch of different songs he would eventually write, something he committed to tape and never thought about a second time. </p>
<p>This hits upon the main issue with releasing Cobain's home-tapes: As King Buzzo of the Melvins noted of this film, Cobain was ""<a href=""http://thetalkhouse.com/music/talks/buzz-osborne-the-melvins-talks/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a master of jerking your chain.</a>"" These tracks mostly feel like an antic mind entertaining itself, and to enshrine them in this way is mystifying. Consider: There’s a track called “Beans” here, and it’s a minute and 20 seconds of Cobain thumbing two notes and singing about eating beans in a shrieking cartoon voice. There’s another called “Rehash” that consists of him hollering silly songwriter words—“rehash,” “chorus,” “solo”—as he plays some power chords. There are brief audio clips of him playing with sped-up and slowed-down voices. The few early demos—""Sappy"", or ""Frances Farmer"", strummed and mumbled as he worked out the song's skeleton—are so inchoate that lavishing any kind of attention on them feels perverse. They serve to remind us that ephemera provide mute testimony of a life’s existence, but say little about its meaning.</p>
<p>There is a precedent for this sort of release, especially with artists who died young with a slim catalog: 2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10391-family-tree/""><i>Family Tree</i></a> gathered together all of the home recordings of Nick Drake, an artist with a similar predilection for committing all his guitar fumbling to tape and even to recording emotionally revealing monologues. <i>Montage of Heck</i> is like a shaggier version of <i>Family Tree</i>, a voyeuristic document that attempts to plop you down in the living room of a dead hero, and it leaves you with a similar hollow feeling.</p>
<p>Cobain fan sites have complained that the <i>Home Recordings</i> crosses the line into exploitation, but this line was crossed years ago, and has been obliterated and trampled many times since. <i>The Home Recordings</i> marks the point where that exploitation enters the absurd. It’s a sad bookend to a captivating film, and an ignoble use of a trove of material. Its purpose isn’t to give us any new music, but to give us one last grasp at his fading spirit. For most people, this is the last phase of a breakup, or of grief—when you smell the t-shirt, and register sadly that the essence is gone.</p></div>"|21157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21157-montage-of-heck-the-home-recordings/|4.0|Jayson Greene

Le1f has long seemed poised to cross-over into the mainstream, and he could still become that pop burglar—but not with his debut album <i>Riot Boi</i>. Although lead single ""Koi"" may sound like a strategic aim at a buzzworthy radio single comparable to the FM accessibility of Le1f's breakthrough track ""Wut,"" <i>Riot Boi</i> is most immediately an album about not being seen. ""I'm wonder like Stevie, like Stevie you won't see me,"" he raps on standout ""Swirl."" If Le1f's career has thus far been about breaking glass ceilings as a queer black rapper, then <i>Riot Boi</i> shows us a trailblazer sitting down among these cracked shards of glass, reckoning with what it means to have come first.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Riot Boi</i><span>'s early cuts capitalize on production polish that moves beyond the underground grittiness of Le1f's first mixtape </span><i>Dark York</i><span> and the simpler sound of his </span><i>Hey</i><span> EP. Opener ""Hi"" succeeds from pure hype, the constant background greetings of a robofemme ""</span><span>Hi!""</span><span> reminding us that this is a long-anticipated debut—while concluding lines ""I'm feelin' like such a new being"" promise a newly matured artist. On ""Rage"",  Le1f offers the</span><span> promise ""It's lit/ Now, let's rage"", but what follows is less ""rage"" than swagger-laced annoyance, as on ""Grace, Alek or Naomi,"" where Le1f spits ""I'm the faggot they stan or they don't understand it/ I run with the posse and I band with the bandits."" This sass saturates ""Swirl,"" which enlists Junglepussy and House of LaDosha to assert the black partner as the erotic powerbroker in interracial trysts—reversing the white gaze. On the track, Le1f reclaims black exoticism with lines like ""I'm a dark-skin nigga on TV."" </span><span>Riot Boi</span><span> thus begins with Le1f navigating his own breakthrough, his point of view oddly retrospective for a debut album—evidencing the new hype economy of the internet, where a star can be made before ever being born.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Le1f's self-reckoning also involves returning to familiar sounds that unfortunately feel like regression rather than mastery. Album midpoint ""Koi,"" alongside ""Umami / Water,"" only recall how much better this kind of aqua shtick worked for Azealia Banks' </span><i>Fantasea</i><span> or even for Le1f's own 2012 tracks ""Bubbles"" and ""My Ooozy."" ""Water"" is built on a melodic riff of what sounds like an electric guitar wet-dreaming of a sitar, Le1f's East-Fucks-West aesthetic at its best. It's the album's most compelling sound, but nevertheless its water witch-hop aesthetic (shared with ""Koi"") diverts the innovative ideas from </span><span><i>Riot Boi</i>'s</span><span> early highlights.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Riot Boi</i><span> delivers what its title promises--a transgression of pop cultural limitations—most clearly in the final three tracks, socially-conscious slow jams with far more overt political messages than Le1f's usual banger-obscured radicalism. This makes for the cringe-worthy ""Tell,"" an admonition to down-low closet cases to come out, but Le1f's political lucidity also allows for the stunning ""Taxi."" The song speaks about sexual economies of racialized desire but doubles as a commentary on the way mainstream audiences ""pass"" Le1f ""like taxis do."" But, he sings, ""I don't care, whatever, it's cool/  Roll the window up on 'em""—making it clear that, whatever crossover potential the album falls short of, Le1f is more than content to remain a riot boi.</span></p></div>"|21109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21109-riot-boi/|7.5|Andy Emitt

He distances himself from the celebrity straw man, but he could easily be viewed as one of them. He's a public figure who visits eateries on Anthony Bourdain's ""No Reservations"", debates politics with Bill Maher, and engages in public arguments like the one he had with CNN's Don Lemon. He's recorded hit albums like </span><i>Eardrum</i><span>, which peaked at No. 2 in 2007. And his 2002 song ""Get By"" is one of the best rap songs of the millennium, a perfect distillation of his working-class striver's aesthetic. Perhaps Kweli affects modesty to emphasize his commitment to the community, and to the political and social issues that affect us. But let's face it: He's not exactly an unknown </span><i>Prisoner of Conscious.</i></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Kweli's collaboration with 9th Wonder,</span><i> Indie 500</i><span>, is all about commitment, whether he's criticizing gentrification practices on ""Every Ghetto"" or memorializing fallen heroes Pimp C, J Dilla, and Roc Raida on ""Great Day in the Morning"". The album title appears to be repurposed from the Indie 5000 parties that briefly flourished in '90s New York during the Rawkus/Fondle 'Em years. Sadly, there are no appearances by Moodswingaz and the Juggaknots here. But Jessica Care Moore, whose name will ring familiar to Nuyorican Poets Café fans, and whose </span><i>Black Tea: The Legend of Jessi James</i><span> was released on Kweli's Javotti Media imprint, delivers a strident declaration of her self-worth on ""These Waters"". Another Javotti artist, the Brazilian-born rapper Niko Is, doesn't stand out as sharply, but he lands some nice lines. ""Motherfuckers scared to speak out, so they tweet out,"" he claims on ""These Waters"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Occasionally, </span><i>Indie 500</i><span> loses focus. Kweli excels at the activist raps, and although his cipher with Problem and Bad Lucc on ""Pay Ya Dues"" lacks competitive tension, it's a nice display of the trio's lyrical skills. His humble-brags on ""Lo Fi"" about how ""Promoters will walk me right to a table and be, like, this is your spread,"" however, seem perfunctory. He doesn't come off as insincere, but it's not his lane.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Indie 500 </i><span>is intended as a statement of self-determination from two artists with superior track records. But its execution feels rushed. <span>The track sequencing could be better. Kweli appears on all but three </span><i>Indie 500</i><span> tracks, and overall, the compilation doesn't sound like a concise effort. </span></span>The production, handled by members of 9th Wonder's Soul Council, often relies on conventional drum arrangements and loop-chopping techniques. There's considerable prowess, however, to be found in Khrysis' contributions. ""Technicolor Easels"", which is a Niko Is solo showcase, is bathed in synthesizer ice. ""Understand"", where Kweli raps alongside Brother Ali and Planet Asia, has an easygoing piano stride.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In spite of its flaws,<i> Indie 500</i> features two can't-miss moments. ""Bangers"" opens with a brief lecture from 9th Wonder, who notes how golden age rap spurred youth to enroll at black colleges, and dryly notes, ""In 1988 to 1993, black college enrollment went up 46 percent."" MK Asante captures the vibe nicely when he says, ""Live from the flames of Baltimore.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Then there's Rapsody, who is part of 9th Wonder's Jamla imprint and appears on three tracks here. In the past, she struggled to get noticed for albums like </span><span><i>The Idea of Beautifu</i>l</span><span> and </span><span><i>She Got Game</i>,</span><span> at least until a feature on Kendrick Lamar's</span><i> To Pimp a Butterfly</i><span> brought her some long overdue attention. On ""Life Ahead of Me"", she candidly addresses sexism in the rap industry: ""If I had a penis your penis would be hard as a brick is/ Saying I'm a king on some rap shit/ But my gender got 'em tender/ I recognize y'all lies."" Rapsody argues that if she were a man, she'd be widely regarded as one of the most talented rappers today, and she might be right.</span></p></div>"|21215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21215-indie-500/|6.3|Mosi Reeves

During his years in Alaska—far away from the postgraduate-composition academy—Adams specialized in minimalist-influenced works that tended to avoid the driving pulse that made minimalism popular with a wide audience. For his part, Kotche spent a lot of time touring with Jeff Tweedy.</p>
<p>But things can change quickly (especially for a genre with such a long tradition). For Adams, the reversal of fortune came with the mania surrounding his 2014 Pulitzer Prize-winning piece <i>Become Ocean</i>: a symphony-length orchestral approximation of maritime ebb and flow. Though <i>Ocean</i> didn’t represent an overhaul of Adams’s aesthetic, it brought his environmentalist’s appreciation for the natural world to a new conceptual height. (The title also gave uninitiated listeners a hint regarding what to expect from his serene-then-raging compositions.) Meantime, Kotche's 2014 classical album <i>Adventureland</i> felt distinguished—even in an active time for indie artists looking to prove their conservatory chops. (The drummer also performed brilliantly on composer Missy Mazzoli's album <i>Vespers for a New Dark Age</i>.)</p>
<p>In the aftermath of his Pulitzer win, Adams has been easier to spot. He’s since moved to New York, where his pieces are programmed at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. Next year, Adams will be the ""composer in residence"" at Knoxville’s Big Ears Festival—the all-genres-welcome avant-bash that also presents Wolf Eyes and Yo La Tengo. Given this, it’s hardly surprising to find Kotche participating in a recording of Adams’s percussion-driven work, <i>Ilimaq</i>. </p>
<p>That title, which is Inuit for ""spirit journey,"" isn’t kidding around. Scored for three different ""stations"" of percussion instruments that the drummer moves between, during a performance, this recorded version also tosses in field recordings of nature, ambient accompaniment, and some live-electronic processing of Kotche’s playing. If that sounds like a busy experience, it can be—but only when experienced as a whole. There’s a superficial stasis that masks much of the development here; if you dive into the 48-minute work expecting an instant hit of obvious Pulitzer-genius, you might find yourself initially underwhelmed.</p>
<p>The twelve-minute opening movement ""Descent"" sounds at first like one long bass drum roll—hurtling forward for a bit, decelerating, then pushing ahead once more. But its closing section presents odd groupings of notes for Kotche to navigate as Adams’s electronic environment undergoes subtle variations. The following movement, ""Under the Ice"", delights in a teasing ambiguity created by the blend of field recordings, electronics, and Kotche’s gentle cymbal work. The cumulative effect is so hypnotic and meditative that when clear, descending pairs of notes appear in ""The Sunken Gamelan"", they hit with the force of power chords. </p>
<p>""Untune the Sky"" brings everything from the composition’s first half hour together for a rite that finds Kotche wailing on an expanded kit, and it’s here where the drummer’s technique is the most impressive. After that apex of clamor, ""Ascension"" provides a calming coda of high-pitch drones. As a suggestive mirror-image of the piece’s opening ""Descent,"" it’s satisfying and logical—though the chief virtue of this piece is Adams’s slow-motion way of arriving at grander, less predictable change.</p></div>"|21205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21205-ilimaq/|7.7|Seth Colter Walls

A young, exploratory and vaguely metallic outfit interested in doom and goth, industrial and krautrock, The Great Tyrant was working on <i>The Trouble with Being Born </i>when Atkins killed himself in 2010. Beck and Teague scrapped the sessions and started a new band, taking the color of the blood-splattered walls where Atkins had died—that is, pinkish-black—as a lurid tribute to the missing member. It's fitting, then, that The Great Tyrant emptied its archives on the same day Pinkish Black offered its latest, greatest work to date, <i>Bottom of the Morning</i>. As a duo, Beck and Teague have finally found the sound and strength for which they've long searched. <a href=""http://www.fwweekly.com/2015/10/07/pinkish-black-bury-the-past-eye-the-future/http://www.fwweekly.com/2015/10/07/pinkish-black-bury-the-past-eye-the-future/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fighting through a half-decade of despair</a>, the results on <i>Bottom of the Morning</i> almost feel heroic.</p>
<p>Pinkish Black's previous two albums were hesitant and uncertain, as though Teague and Beck were trying to define their shared aesthetic while teasing out a new duo chemistry, too. Their fine 2012 debut packed in some excellent ideas and alluring sounds, but the band—particularly Teague's voice—was obscured in effects. Though more forthright, the subsequent <i>Razed to the Ground</i> found the duo again trying to do too much, as they moved from slow-motion dirges to extravagant, pulse-pounding doom.</p>
<p>But <i>Bottom of the Morning</i> is, at last, the first unified, unabashed Pinkish Black album. These songs are unveiled, a message that's as clear with the hook-heavy, march-like opener ""Brown Rainbow"" as it is with the beautifully brutal instrumental closer ""The Master is Away"". On these seven tracks, Beck and Teague amplify the grandiosity, directness and intensity of what they do. The keyboards can be as rich as a Tangerine Dream or Goblin record, the melodies as creepy and contagious as John Carpenter. And Teague emerges as a powerhouse capable of summoning John Bonham, Klaus Dinger and Billy Cobham. But the real coup here comes through Beck's voice. Even on The Great Tyrant's LPs, especially the now-unearthed <i>The Trouble with Being Born</i>, it was clear how capable he was, though he wasn't yet quite in command of his talent. Here, however, his mix of near-monastic chants, witchy incantations and operatic verses—now, not crowded by manipulation or undercut with noise—serves as the record's compulsory core. You lean in close to hear what he's saying.</p>
<p>It should come as little surprise that a band named for a friend's suicide embraces dark lyrics. Indeed, these songs approach the nihilistic. ""Special Dark"" is little more than a string of negative participles and adjectives—""withered, fractured … bleaker, starker""—intoned in a dour murmur over blown-out bass and busy drums. At the start of ""Bottom of the Morning"", Beck whispers and sings about wasting life and wasting time; at track's end, he howls about endless cycles of false promises and futile attempts at self-improvement. ""Everyday's the same again,"" he sings, his voice stentorian but graceful, like a latter-day Scott Walker. ""Everyday it's growing thin."" Since Atkins' death in 2010, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/9743-beauty-in-nothingness-pinkish-blacks-songs-for-the-apocalypse/"" target=""_blank"">they've survived the death of several family members and severe sickness</a>; the weight and worry of the world are central to these songs.</p>
<p>But somehow, those qualities are boons, not burdens. Despite all the despair and misanthropy written into these words, these songs often feel like conquests. The album itself is triumphant, like a survivalist manifesto offered at the close of a markedly tough spell. Behind the grim declarations of ""Bottom of the Morning"", for instance, the twinkle of the organ, the groove of the left hand's bassline and the dance of the drums suggest Miles Davis' <i>On the Corner</i>,<i> </i>perhaps even Weather Report. And though ""Burn My Body"" is as lyrically macabre as the title implies, bright synthesizer arpeggios and the back-and-forth motion of the drums offer the relief and release endemic to the narrator's final request. As the song ends, the synthesizers and drums intimate a skyward ascension, a last will finally honored. On <i>Bottom of the Morning</i>, Beck and Teague have effectively stepped beyond the ghosts of the past, landing in a present where the results are now as compelling as the backstory. </p></div>"|21276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21276-bottom-of-the-morning/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15937-glass-swords/""><i>Glass Swords</i></a> appeared, in the fall of 2011, it was measured primarily against dubstep's yardstick, praised in part for how far it had stretched the limits of that form. Nobody talks about dubstep any more. These days, as far as swaggering, hard-knuckled electronic music goes, trap rules the roost—thanks in no small part to <i>Glass Swords</i>, which along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"">AraabMuzik</a> proved that Southern rap beats plus needle-nosed synths could make for an even more invigorating rave soundtrack than dubstep did.</p>
<p><i>Glass Swords</i> wasn't <i>just </i>a dubstep or trap album, of course; part of its genius was the way that it spun so many sounds and ideas into a bright, high-energy electro-funk whose central contradiction—brittle in sound, pliant in structure—turned out to be visionary. (Rustie deserves some credit for dreaming up the sound that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31081-sophie/"">SOPHIE</a> and PC Music would run with: Without <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6MP0Z86K5U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hover Traps""</a>, there'd be no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17009-sophie-lemonade/"">""Lemonade""</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17023-sophie-hard/"">""Hard""</a>.) Perhaps that inventiveness is why it took the Glasgow producer nearly three years to come up with a follow-up: last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19610-rustie-green-language/""><i>Green Language</i></a>, a mixed bag that balanced his giddy hyper-funk instrumentals with relatively standard-issue trap. Distancing himself from that album, Rustie now <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2015/11/05/rustie-new-album-evenifudontbelieve-stream-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">complains</a> that it was ""too A&amp;Red,"" his vision compromised by managers and outside influences. And just a little more than a year after that album, he's back with a new one, the surprise release <i>EVENIFUDONTBELIEVE</i>, and it represents a hard left turn back towards Rustie's carefully tended turf.</p>
<p>There is no doubting who is in control of his vision this time around. There are no cloud-rap forays, no ballads, no grime MCs, no features at all—well, not unless you count the five songs credited ""(feat. Rustie),"" in which the producer sings and plays guitar (not that you would necessarily know it from listening to the songs). Tongue-in-cheek though the gesture may be, the funny thing about the distinction is how little difference is detectable between the songs ""featuring"" Rustie and those that are just <i>by </i>him. Both incorporate vocal chops frothed to high heaven, like towering Everests of Cool Whip; both are topped by soaring, tremolo-shaken synth leads; and both are driven forward by churning rhythms that split the difference between hardstyle's 160-BPM kicks and trap's lumbering syncopations.</p>
<p>It is a rawer, scrappier record than either of his prior LPs, and the way he flips the bird at conventional notions of fidelity is almost punk. The high end often has the crinkly cellophane quality of low-bitrate MP3s, and there's so much information being stuffed into the treble register that it occasionally registers as buzz. His drums are plenty forceful—his kicks and snares, in particular, sound like they've been pushed deeply into the red and then run through even more distortion, just for fun—but it lacks the sub-bass of most trap, preferring to muster all its energies for a mid-range wallop that thumps you in the sternum. The rolling toms of ""Big Catzzz"" sounds like he's recorded them off <i>Fury Road</i> with his iPhone.</p>
<p>If his sonics are idiosyncratic, his structures are less so. A typical track consists of a minute-long introduction, 30 seconds of the main theme, a minute of pullback, a 30-second return to the main theme, and, finally, a tidy denouement and fadeout. Everything in the song—the rolling drums, the looped voices, the smeared synths, the crescendos of white noise—leads up to that big hit of adrenaline. What's even more striking is how similar the main themes sound, once you subtract all the surrounding flotsam and jetsam. If you placed the album's biggest hooks side by side, it'd sound like one song, uniform in mood, instrumentation, and tone color.</p>
<p>Is that a problem? It all depends upon your tolerance. If the idea of mixing Pop Rocks in your breakfast Mountain Dew sounds good to you (or if, like Rustie, <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2015/11/05/rustie-new-album-evenifudontbelieve-stream-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you listen to happy hardcore to go to sleep</a>), then <i>EVENIFUDONTBELIEVE</i> will be right up your alley. For the rest of us, there are some genuine thrills (sorry, thrillz) here: ""First Mythz"", with its dolphin clicks and bullet-riddled hi-hats; the calmer ""Atlantean Airship"", which sounds like <i>Glass Swords</i>-era Rustie curdled by acidic distortion. ""Peace Upzzz"" is one of the few songs that actually refuses a big payoff: It's all crescendo and no climax, and better for it.</p>
<p>For those who aren't fully on board with Rustie's aesthetic, exhaustion sets in quickly, and the slope of diminishing returns is steep. And that's probably just fine with him, because this is a one-man rollercoaster, from the ""features"" to the credits (""Written by Rustie/ Produced by Rustie/ Extra vocals by Rustie/ Guitar by Rustie/ Art direction by Rustie/ Photography by Rustie""). There is zero daylight between the artist and his vision, as he pounds tirelessly away at one very specific idea. It is less an album than a set of 15 variations upon a single theme.

Her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9345-frankie-cosmos/"">acknowledgment of Frank O'Hara as a significant influence</a> makes a good deal of sense; like O'Hara, her work is both personal and abstract, economical, and infused with humanity, ""between two persons"" rather than a communication between listener and artist. For those concerned with Kline's overtly twee aesthetic, worried that an overdose of saccharine will blot out any other subtle flavoring, her work contains self-deprecation and displacement in good countermeasure. The balance of sweet and salty feels not just purposeful but realistic.</p>
<p><i>Fit Me In</i>, a compact and efficient EP portending a more fleshed-out full-band LP in 2016, is an experiment in what Kline's songwriting would sound like given nearly all electronic instrumentation. A collaboration with frequent musical partner Aaron Maine of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31108-porches/"">Porches</a>, <i>Fit Me In </i>is more in line with Kline's prolific home recordings than a full indie pop record like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19130-frankie-cosmos-zentropy/"">Zentropy</a></i> (opener ""Korean Food"" appeared first on 2013's self-released <a href=""https://ingridsuperstar.bandcamp.com/album/daddy-cool"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Daddy Cool</i></a>). Drum machine and synth-heavy, this is true bedroom pop<span>—</span>so intimate as to show the rumpled coverlet and the minute, ancient, nearly unnoticeable stains on the carpet. As is Kline's wont, these songs are little glimpses into her fully realized universe, less verse-chorus-verse pop confections than open-ended, contemporary poetic constructions that don't stop where the recording ends. Like poetry, they require reading and interpretation and us to be engaged as listeners, in communication with Cosmos; art that exists ""between two persons"" requires dialogue.</p>
<p>""Young"" in particular is arch and sly, a response to media commentary that would seek to cast Kline as a fresh-faced ingenue, a character in a box rather than a real, complicated young woman. ""I heard about being young/ But I'm not sure how it's done.../ Something about fun,"" she sings. <i>You can interpret me</i>, she seems to be saying, <i>and I'll interpret you right back. </i>In ""O Contest Winner"", she boasts ""No need for a retest/ I know I'm a genius,"" tongue firmly in cheek, again pushing against others' expectations of her and her work. Such bragging is usually the province of hip-hop, and to hear it in delicate indie pop context could feel self-conscious or appropriative, but in Kline's subtle delivery it sounds both sincere and welcome, both a refutation of the idea that female artists must always minimize their senses of self-worth and an awareness of the sheer absurdity of any declaration of ego.</p>
<p>""Korean Food"" and ""Sand"" are both tender etchings of the everyday nature of real love, a theme Kline excels at exploring; her version of love is not grand or epic, not forced into any particular narrative arc. She finds love in moment-to-moment minutiae, in the smallest pleasures and least valued rituals, without weighting those moments too heavily: ""And touch all the books outside the Strand/ Their oldest pages soft like sand.""</p>
<p>There's a reason we're captivated as a society by well-written diaries<span>—</span>at their best, sketches of others' lives as they live them allow us chances to slow down, to connect and to understand one another that we rarely encounter in a highly relational world. Greta Kline is a master at the art of the musical diary<span>—</span>never confessional in a way that feels exploitative and lurid, but tender, intimate, and real nonetheless. We're fortunate she keeps letting us into her world in this way.</p></div>"|21254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21254-fit-me-in-ep/|7.0|Jes Skolnik

But why did Puff Daddy release </span><i>MMM</i><span> as a mixtape? At 44 minutes and containing at least three great songs, with a concept to boot (</span><i>MMM </i><span>tangentially tells a story loosely based on the movie </span><i>Paid in Full</i><span>), it has enough weight and heft that it could have served as a direct sequel to Diddy Dirty Money's enduring 2010 album </span><i>Last Train to Paris</i><span>. Instead, it lives in a low-stakes no-man's-land between Mixtape and Album (despite being free on Datpiff, it was somehow released in an ""Edited"" version), eliciting slight confusion. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>MMM</i> has been publicly hyped since at least <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/2mrH0uJl76/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this summer</a>, but from the first track, Puff Daddy is already shouting out his ""real"" album <i>No Way Out 2,</i> ostensibly forthcoming sometime soon. What follows is 13 tracks of sometimes great, sometimes anonymous music. Obviously an abundance of free ""good enough"" albums is a First World Problem to the nth degree, but the glut of them this year in rap is symptomatic of over-consumption by the listeners.  Shouldn't we be thrilled Puff has, in effect, finally followed up <i>Last Train to Paris</i>? Is it churlish to complain about free music? But the fact remains, if you subtract three filler tracks and a song not credited to Puff (closer ""Blow a Check"", by Zoey Dollaz) what you have are nine new Diddy songs that add up to ""OK.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">However, to stress: <i>MMM </i>is not bad. Its concept provides a coherence that keeps the album interesting even when suffering through an interminable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a> guest verse. After the intro, an ominous, low-end rattling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"">Chromatics</a> sample breathes life into the album on the second track, ""Harlem"", a thrilling moment that establishes Puff Daddy's spin of his home neighborhood as a strange, almost dystopian urban setting, which is befitting a sample most closely associated with <i>Drive</i> and that movie's vision of seedy, night-time Los Angeles.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">True to Puff form, <i>MMM </i>does a great job of gathering veteran New York voices and pulling decent performances from them. Between his frequent toasts to Biggie and the appearance of 2/3 of the Lox, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2614-lil-kim/"">Lil' Kim</a>, and DJ Brucie B, <i>MMM</i> qualifies as something of a throwback late-'90s New York album: the whole crew (including several new voices) trade verses with Puff, including the Lil' Kim-assisted ""Auction"", one of <i>MMM</i>'s brightest highlights, constructed on a bombastic sample recalling the best, most classically-maximalist Diddy productions, somewhere between <i>No Way Out</i> and <i>Press Pla</i>y.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The best song here is ""You Could Be My Lover"" featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> and Gizzle, which prominently samples Cody Chesnutt's ""Boylife in America"", cleverly and subtly drawing a connect between two generations of off-kilter, non-traditional R&amp;B artists. It's a springy, sprightly track, stunning in its warm analog simplicity and also for bursting out of the album's brooding, synth-heavy palette. It also in some ways recalls the giddy highs of <i>Last Train to Paris</i>, which a half-decade ago pretty much perfected a potent and prescient mix of blunt romanticism and inspired, indelible production, and a knack for getting the right guest verse, the right hook, the right tone at the same time—just ask <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a>, or revisit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10706-trey-songz/"">Trey Songz</a>'s overlooked 2014 record <i>Trigga</i>.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-dcf216b4-f322-2734-3e6e-fe2e5fdcf097""><span>The song also contains what ultimately redeems </span><i>MMM</i><span>—Puff Daddy's fountain-of-youth charm. On ""Help Me"", he says ""young nigga told me I'm old, I said 'old and rich.'"" From someone else, this line doesn't add up to much, but from Puff, it banks its charm on his reputation as a no-apologies capitalist. On ""Workin'"" he says, ""if you see us in the club with Ciroc by the tub we workin',"" then right after that ""in the DJ booth like an independent group like 'look at this record we workin'"". That is the appeal of Puff Daddy right there—the personable opportunist that recalls American, Gatsby-ian myths of self-made success, and then his obsessive love of music. He's ""old"" now, but to many still the guy in a shiny suit somewhere. <span>Puff released <i>MMM</i> as a mixtape because he loves making and releasing obsessively fussed-over music as much as keeping his stock high</span></span><span>. He still commands attention from hip-hop heads and the casual music fan alike. That's worth something.</span></span></p></div>"|21272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21272-mmm/|6.6|Matthew Ramirez

The brainchild of West Coast weirdo Terry Ork and art school dropout Charles Ball, the label was blessed with a number of big firsts. Ork released not just the first Television single, but also the first music from poet and punk rock originator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2052-richard-hell/"">Richard Hell</a> and the first singles by Memphis-based musician Alex Chilton following the dissolution of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>. This in addition to great power pop by Chris Stamey as well as new wave groups like Marbles, Student Teachers, and the Revelons. </p>
<p>Compiled by <a href=""http://www.numerogroup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Numero Group</a>, the lavishly packaged and thoroughly researched <i>Ork Records: New York, New York</i> collects the label's complete 13-single catalog along with a number of related releases that never made it to shelves during the label's existence. Among these are a scrapped single by New Jersey's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"">the Feelies</a> and a sidelined 7"" by the rock critic Lester Bangs that ultimately saw daylight via Spy Records, an imprint run by John Cale.  </p>
<p>In 2015, nostalgia for late '70s New York City can feel oppressive, given its documentation in an endless stream of record reissues, memoirs, films, and biographies. If you grew up during the '90s, your entire cultural coming-of-age might have been spent surfing successive waves of the city's punk-era remembrance—from ""Saturday Night Live""<i> </i>reruns to Julian Schnabel's <i>Basquiat </i>biopic, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">the Strokes</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>. But <i>New York, New York</i> is a significant artifact.</p>
<p>The music and photographs capture the formative moments of punk and new wave, before those genres had been thoroughly defined. It's a glimpse at iconic personalities in a moment of vulnerability, before they were fully hatched and before anybody cared. By contemporary standards, these songs might not register as wild or controversial. In the context of the '70s—a time of slick pop and bluesy choogle—Ork's artists were from another planet. The first sound on Television's ""Little Johnny Jewel"" is not a squeal of feedback or an expertly rehearsed riff, but the thin and elastic tone of Tom Verlaine's guitar plugged directly into the mixing board. Hell's ""(I Belong to The) Blank Generation"" is a bizarre throwback of a different kind—a skewed and slanted remake of the Rod McKuen's jazzy 1959 novelty song <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5-HlUAOjGE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Beat Generation""</a> that was a far cry from the buzz saw tones and pop minimalism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">the Ramones</a>.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;"">Listening back now, the music is familiar because these sounds have become so deeply embedded in the DNA of today's indie rock. Chris Stamey's ""The Summer Sun"" is nostalgia-tinged bubblegum pop, buoyed by jangling acoustic guitars and backing ""oohs/ahhs."" Chilton's singles are charmingly stoned and discombobulated proto-slacker rock. A one-off studio project, Prix delivers the pained power pop that Ork probably wanted from Chilton, but the singer was then unwilling to deliver. Others offer slightly fudged takes on the more established downtown bands. The Erasers' clean guitar tones and slanted melodies recall Television. The Student Teachers' stripped down and hookly ""Channel 13"" is not too far afield from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/630-blondie/"">Blondie</a>, whose keyboardist, Jimmy Destri, produced the band's single. These bands weren't necessarily biting a successful style, just taking cues from their peers.</p>
<p>Bangs' ""Let It Blurt"" is an outlier, in that it is terrible. The music<span>—</span>a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Beefheart</a>-inspired and Quine-penned backing track—isn't the problem. It's the singing. Bangs slurs and blubbers about the details of a break-up. The details are ugly and unflattering. If Television's music attempted ecstatic transcendence, ""Let It Blurt"" represents the opposite end of the spectrum—earthly woe, gracelessness, the sadness and confusion of lonely dudes. Perhaps this was the intent, though. For what it's worth, the critic seems aware that both the song and his lyrics are absurd.</p>
<p>A California counterculture type lured east by Andy Warhol's Factory scene, Ork met Verlaine and Hell when the latter was a clerk at Cinemabilia, a Greenwich Village film memorabilia shop that he managed. He took an active interest in their musical pursuits, set them up with guitarist Richard Lloyd, and when they formed Television, Ork became the band's first manager. In 1975, when the group—by that point in its official, Hell-less lineup—recorded a few 4-track demos, Ork agreed to press a single. The record did well enough to warrant a second release, Richard Hell's first two songs with the Voidoids. Because Ork was a good scenester but a poor businessman, Ball came on to help professionalize the operation. </p>
<p>Initially, Ork's mission was to capture a local scene that had grown up around CBGBs but over time there wasn't much incentive to keep going. The bands were not popular and there was little hope of financial reward. It was hard for bands to get booked outside of New York, even regionally. In the liner notes, the Feelies' Dave Weckerman explains that there was only one new wave-tolerant venue west of the Hudson.</p>
<p>Many of Ork's artists were not particularly fond of their singles on the imprint. At the time, Television's Richard Lloyd told interviewers that he hated ""Little Johnny Jewel""—""It worked primarily as a demo,"" Hell said of his single, ""I can't stand to hear it."" But the lack of polish is what makes many of these recordings compelling. On <i>Marquee Moon</i>, Television sounded immaculate and artful. Here, the band is sloppy and primitive, but also unconventional and free. On their debut album, <i>Crazy Rhythms</i>, the Feelies sounded tense and jittery, but Ork's version of ""Fa Cé La"" is fast and blisteringly loud.</p>
<p>Eventually, the money ran out and Ork folded in 1979. Ball would go on to found the influential no wave label, Lust/Unlust and Ork left both New York and the music business, returning to the West Coast. Both have since passed on (Ork in 2004, Ball in 2012). When the label fizzled, punk and new wave were still very much underground. Of the bands that populated the CBGBs scene, only Blondie and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a> had found anything resembling national success.</p>
<p>For all the talk of doom and gloom in today's post-Internet music world, some comfort can be taken in the fact that, even when people were still buying records, Ork's prospects seemed equally grim. The label's biggest hit sold 6,000 units, but, according to the set's liner notes, most releases were lucky to sell a third of that. If you're running an independent record label today, those numbers might not be that far out of reach.</p>
<p>In Ork's case, the label wasn't ultimately a lark or a waste of money—the music was heard. These singles diffused out into the world and found their way into the hands of weirdos in far-flung locales. When promoting Hell's single in 1976, Ork ran advertisements with the singer's phone number and suggested that people, ""Call Hell."" ""I called him,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"">Minutemen</a> bassist Mike Watt told author Michael Azzerad in the book, <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>. ""I said, 'Is this Hell?' And he said, 'Yeah.' And I got scared and I hung up."" That accessibility stuck with Watt, though. ""That, to me, was punk.""</p></div>"|21203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21203-ork-records-new-york-new-york/|8.8|Aaron Leitko

But the strutting ""Northern Lights"" stood out for a number of reasons: Those teeming, plasticized synth melodies; that widescreen, euphoric chorus; the promise that ""everything we touch turns to gold"" that on repeat listens sounded more and more like a threat. In spite of singer Kate Akhurst's voice bearing a borderline-scary similarity to Karin Dreijer Andersson, Kate Boy's music remained irresistible, dressing up <i>Silent Shout</i>'s pressurized gloom in vivid, maximalist clothes.</p>
<p>Kate Boy's long-gestating debut, <i>One</i>, continues to hit those same targets, for better and for worse. It includes ""Northern Lights"" and three other tracks culled from an EP quietly released earlier this year, and none of the album's new offerings stray from those songs' well-established blueprint. Kate Boy loves pounding synths and a good shout-along chorus, and so every song on <i>One</i> has both, a technique that is as exhausting as often as it is potent. On ""Lion for Real"", Akhurst's cries of ""It's adrenaline that you're traveling"" are matched in force by the synthetic drums that rally behind her like a militia, an explosion of sound that practically demands you to move. ""Burn"" is similarly gratifying, in a slower, more consuming way, Akhurst stretching her vowels out in a pained howl that sounds like an alternate universe in which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27589-fever-ray/"">Fever Ray</a> was making <i>Billboard</i>-charting singles. Nothing on <i>One</i> really feels as immediate as ""Northern Lights"", but Akhurst's ability to grab you by the throat with each chorus and the trio's playful use of texture—the descending wash of glassy synths at the end of ""Human Engine"", the '80s-indebted guitar line that slinks through ""Higher""—make <i>One</i> an easy, undemanding, and ultimately unsurprising listen.</p>
<p>This speaks to Kate Boy's credentials: Australian-born Akhurst has been working as a songwriter since the age of 16 and spent time in L.A. penning songs for Disney star Ashley Tisdale and ""Glee"" actor Charice in the early 2010s before migrating to Sweden, where she met Markus Dextegen and Oskar Sikow Engström and formed Kate Boy (Engström has since been replaced by Hampus Nordgren). But where the group excels at assembling all the bones of a good pop song, <i>One</i>'s lyrical content is broad even by those same standards. Platitudes like ""It doesn't have to be this way/ We're different, still the same/ Move your mind to a higher state"" are vague and don't manage to express much nuance beyond ""we're all human, get it together."" ""Self Control"" reaches a bit further, girding its narrator's insecurities as self-defense and providing an interesting counterpoint to the bright, jagged sounds Kate Boy likes to plays around with. On ""Human Engine"", they even shoot for a bit of self-awareness: ""We like the word 'dynamic'/ We like to use it a lot."" Still, those moments are fleeting; sometimes the group even resort to baffling, tech-referencing word salad, as on ""In Your Eyes"": ""Activate emotion waves, oppression down/ Activate the open changes flowing out.""</p>
<p>But maybe Kate Boy's sleekly designed songs aren't meant to be ingested with so much scrutiny. They're aiming for the same big, emotional targets as those aforementioned electropop peers here, with enough brooding style to make it distinct. Besides, the group has admitted that they're painting with broad strokes, saying in an interview last month that their main goal is to create ""something that we can all feel empowered singing together."" There are enough dance-ready, skyward hooks on <i>One</i> to render that mission accomplished. Perhaps next time they'll have something worthwhile to say.</p></div>"|21252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21252-one/|6.9|Eric Torres

These 14 tracks are evidence of Boucher's labor and an articulation of a pop vision that is incontrovertibly <i>hers</i>, inviting the wider world in.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Grimes shows that Boucher is the ultimate fangirl study: a D.I.Y. musician whose love of Mariah, Katy Perry, and K-pop has expanded her palette, driven by her fascination with the possibilities of the synthetic and unreal, and ultimately given wings to <i>Art Angels</i>. Here, she closes the gap between the pop she's idolized and the pop she is capable of. Boucher has claimed that the record has two halves, and indeed, the songs line up most easily into beginning- and end-of-the-night dancefloor jams. The former is exemplified by the bright, anxious ""Kill V. Maim"", with its mocking cheerleader chant over blown-out beats and Boucher working both ends of her register in a propulsive celebration of vocal fry.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Same for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17777-grimes-flesh-without-blood/"" target=""_blank"">""Flesh Without Blood""</a>, which is the sweetest fuck-off of 2015, one that highlights that there is much more to Boucher's voice than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16211-grimes-visions/"" target=""_blank""><i>Visions</i></a> ever had a chance to reveal. The song is Boucher eating the lunch that Miley packed, may it be #blessed with infinite stadium-EDM remixes. Post-<i>Art Angels</i>, it's hard to imagine anyone will reject a Boucher-penned cut: This is an album, but it's also a resume, and someone who made ""California"" could certainly be making crossover hits for any marquee Nashville name, while ""Easily"" suggests that Kesha co-writes should be in Boucher's future.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The late-night closers and their arrangements are where Boucher shows her mastery and discipline as a producer. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17367-grimes-realiti/"" target=""_blank"">""Realiti""</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17808-grimes-venus-fly-ft-janelle-monae/"" target=""_blank"">""Venus Fly""</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/"" target=""_blank"">Janelle Monáe</a>, and ""Butterfly"" give her a new set of peers: Sure, she's there with collaborator Monáe and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">Annie Clark</a> as an auteur, but purely as a pop producer she's as deft and clever as anyone we consider a master of Top 40 craft—be it Greg Kurstin or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a>. The songs are graced with small details: curious skeets of beats, buried samples that only appear once, toxically cute '90s pop guitar. The songs build in unexpected ways, but explode and gratify in the way we hope pop always will. ""Butterfly"" is a let-tonight-last-forever mutant bruiser with roiling sub-bass, the chorus's side-chained pulse making it like an uncanny valley version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2782-kylie-minogue/"" target=""_blank"">Kylie Minogue</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfr9bhSmfXc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Can't Get You Out of My Head""</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All of this might seem as if Boucher has fashioned a whole-cloth reinvention and is gunning for the Top 40, but neither of these things feel true. <i>Art Angels </i>is a natural progression from <i>Visions</i>; if you strained out some of the processing and murk of the latter, you would find these structures lurking. Boucher's voice is recognizable and familiar, but it's bigger and has more range and depth than on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12617-grimes-oblivion/"" target=""_blank"">""Oblivion""</a>. This album foregrounds her, samples her, piles tracks of her half a dozen high to form melodies and countermelodies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One of the most notable and striking differences between <i>Art Angels</i> and its Top 40 kin is that these are <i>not</i> love songs. The album is an epic holiday buffet of tendentious feminist fuck-off, with second helpings for anonymous commenters and music industry blood-suckers. Her conflicted, vertiginous relationship with the fast fame that followed <i>Visions</i> seems to have led her to a place of DGAF liberation. Some songs, like ""Kill V. Maim"", course with a thrilling rage, even a casual misandry. (""I'm only a man/ I do what I can,"" she sings on the hook). Yet, what's most exciting within <i>Art Angels</i> is the sheer will and fearlessness of Boucher's fight to be heard and seen on her own terms. She's not a human Tumblr, as we called her (somewhat humiliatingly) in 2012; she's a human zeitgeist, redrawing all the binaries and boundaries by which we define pop music and forcing us to come along.</p></div>"|21264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21264-art-angels/|8.5|Jessica Hopper

On his 2013 breakthrough as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"">Blood Orange</a>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18736-blood-orange-cupid-deluxe"">Cupid Deluxe</a></i>, Devonté Hynes conjured vapory, psychedelic R&amp;B that played like a bizarro soundtrack to water-warped VHS recordings of early Cinemax After Dark broadcasts—the same aesthetic New Zealand's Connan Mockasin shot for on his own LP from that year, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18748-connan-mockasin-caramel/"">Carmel</a></i>. Like this year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20799-no-life-for-me/"">No Life for Me</a></i> from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"">Wavves</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"">Cloud Nothings</a>, the EP gathers two like minds whose tastes and skill sets overlap so fully that partnering them almost seems redundant.</p>
<p>There's enough variation in how Hynes and Mockasin approach their leftfield pop to create some interesting contrasts, though. Hynes is the more polished and more versatile of the pair, an industry songwriter-for-hire who, for all his iconoclastic tendencies, has long been tempted by Top 40's allure. Mockasin's recent process has been more hermetic: He recorded <i>Carmel</i> entirely alone in a hotel room in a foreign city, and next to the open-armed vulnerability of <i>Cupid Deluxe</i>, it sounds rogueish and distant. Mockasin doesn't necessarily shy from heartfelt expressions, but he often cloaks them behind a smirk.<br/> <br/> So the two make good foils, and<i> Myths 001</i> is never more amusing than when it plays Hynes' sincerity against Mockasin's oddball falsetto. The duo recorded the EP in Texas over about a week during the Marfa Myths festival this spring with little planning, but all that feels rushed is its 11-minute runtime. The production is nearly as luscious as <i>Cupid Deluxe</i>, all soft-rock decadence and red-light ambiance, and two of its three tracks, while not quite knockouts, are distinctively peculiar. ""La Fat Fur"" opens the EP with a gust of trembling post-punk, imagining what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a> might have sounded like if they'd gone through a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> phase in the '80s. ""Feelin' Lovely"" similarly has some fun scribbling across genre boundaries, piling bluesy riffs and jazz-fusion keyboards and saxophones over an unusually funky quiet storm groove, playing like a funhouse homage to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>'s <i>Midnight Love</i>.<br/> <br/> The slow-burn closer ""Big Distant Crush"" could use a little bit of that eccentricity. It's the EP's most earnest number, but also its most meandering, five minutes of aimless heartache that can't help but feel like an attempt to pad an otherwise skimpy EP. There's enough here to demonstrate that Hynes and Mockasin have some chemistry, but not enough to fully show it off. This is probably to be expected from an EP whipped up from scratch in just a week, but whichever artists end up on<i> Myths 002</i> might do well to consider reserving a few extra days in the studio in case they hit it off.</p></div>"|21267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21267-myths-001-collaborative-recordings/|6.0|Evan Rytlewski

The music they produced combined easy-to-predict elements—like Kelly's churning, doomy guitars and Williams' Burroughsian spoken-word rant-poems—with surprising ones, like the industrial streak provided by Parker's electronic beats.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Despite its seat-of-the-pants beginnings, the group's found equilibrium, and on their second studio album, they're chasing down new ideas with a new confidence. <i>Know How to Carry a Whip</i> brings the electro-industrial elements to the forefront and also pushes into their most unexpected terrain yet—songs with distinct pop structures and even catchy melodies.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While it isn't going to spoil the group's esoteric reputation, <i>Whip</i>'s a record that you could feel comfortable passing along to casual heavy music fans. In its first half, the album has headbangable beats, grinding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Sabbath</a>-y guitars, and actual hooks. The opener, ""Crossing My One Good Finger"", might be the catchiest cut any member of the band has ever been involved with, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"">Neubauten</a>-inspired drums, thunderous guitars, and a fist-pumping chorus (even if the lyrics seem to be about suffocating on toxic fumes). You could actually dance to ""White Man's Gonna Lose"", as long as Williams' unhinged nihilism doesn't crush your buzz.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All of the catchy and danceable parts are covered in layers of sonic grime, expertly rendered by Parker, one of the world's leading experts at making records sound really bad in a really good way. They are also shot through with the searing misery that only Williams can really bring to a song. As a group, they remain obsessed with destruction and decay; fans looking for more of the nightmare poetry readings that defined <i>Last City Zero</i> should be perversely pleased by tracks like ""I Was Never Good at Meth"" that frame Williams' feverish, imagistic stanzas in washes of junkyard noise.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Last City Zero</i> positioned Corrections House as one of the more interesting participants in the industrial music resurgence, and <i>Know How to Carry a Whip</i> places them in the lead. Feral and unrelentingly hostile, it's a ragged-edged, rusty shank plunged deep into the ribs of the modern day. Anyone whose formative years as a music fan involved Skinny Puppy or the Wax Trax! label at its peak will feel right at home.</span></p></div>"|21207.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21207-know-how-to-carry-a-whip/|7.0|Miles Raymer

Back in February, Jones released Trust Fund's debut <a href=""https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/album/no-ones-coming-for-us"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>No One's Coming for Us</i></a>, which he broke down in a <a href=""http://diymag.com/2015/02/09/track-by-track-trust-fund-no-ones-coming-for-us"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">track-by-track feature</a> with unusually transparent remarks on his inspirations. He says, ""I wanted this song to sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31468-radiator-hospital/"">Radiator Hospital</a>"" about three different tracks, and then repeats that line about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30624-swearin/"">Swearin'</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2919-mount-eerie/"">Mount Eerie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31657-tony-molina/"">Tony Molina</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee/"">Waxahatchee</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1640-the-field-mice/"">the Field Mice</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a>.</p>
<p>Some bands bristle when asked about their influences, as if disclosing them will reveal the shocking truth that <i>they are </i><i>not</i><i> original</i> to the world. Jones often frets about people continuing to refer to Trust Fund as a DIY outfit since he signed to Welsh indie <a href=""http://www.turnstilemusic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Turnstile</a> and received a small advance to make <i>Seems Unfair</i> in a studio rather than his bedroom. Although he's hardly breached intervention-worthy excess, his openness about his artistic debts reads as a very deliberate way of keeping the audience-facing aspect of the DIY ethos foregrounded: <i>this is what made me do this; no form of inspiration is too new to be legitimate</i>.</p>
<p>Even without the handy birdspotters' guide, <i>Seems Unfair</i> makes its references overt: It's an indie rock record with the bright, shaggy-dog qualities of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3998-superchunk/"">Superchunk</a>, and it often recalls early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5337-los-campesinos/"">Los Campesinos!</a> minus the hyperactive streak. You could isolate patches that sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a>, too, but <i>Seems Unfair</i> is much more distinct than its predecessor, thanks in part to the precise production of MJ from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31499-hookworms/"">Hookworms</a>. Jones' extremely polarizing voice also helps matters (in a way): He sings in a chalky adenoidal tone that cuts through its surrounds like wax through watercolor.</p>
<p>Hooks only occasionally pierced the fog of Trust Fund's debut; here, strange and beautiful boy-girl harmonies cut through the careening fuzz, giving extra shape to these songs. There are folky vocal touches in the breakdown of ""4<span style=""font-size: 12.5px;"">th </span>August"" and on the title track, where the band cuts through Jones' hushed words with formal choral chants. That song's enjoyably odd beginnings are wasted on a generic, puppyish end, although other tracks on <i>Seems Unfair</i> bring an almost prog sensibility to indie pop: ""Scared II"" starts full tilt, hangs a while in a highly strung, one-note guitar barrage, and ends on a triumphal cascade of vocals interlaced with a careening solo.</p>
<p>The relentlessly peppy pace carries along Jones' lyrics, which are as guileless as his approach to interviews. He writes about immediate fears but also the fear of change, often with a similarly simple pathos to Waxahatchee's Katie Crutchfield. ""Michal's Plan"" outlines someone's failed intentions to swim every day; instead, their bathing suit is ""wet and festering in a Tesco bag at the foot of [their] bed."" <i>Seems Unfair</i> is full of characters who seem to struggle with everyday minutiae, but Jones throws a magnifying glass on what may seem to more worldly observers like small stakes. Supermarkets crop up a lot in his lyrics, their shiny floors the sites of emotional reconciliation (""Big Asda"") and the stages for great triumphs: ""Baby, we walk like dreamers do/ Skating through the Free-From to world foods,"" Jones sings on ""Dreamers"".</p>
<p>Sometimes his plainspoken quality is too much. The driving ""Scared II"" is about Jones' fear of his partner dying: ""Do a wee, brush my teeth, and you'll be gone forever,"" he sings. Twee is a worn-out, gendered term that's best retired, but Jones' self-effacing use of the word ""wee"" kind of makes you long for a good shower of territorial pissings. Maybe it's intentional though: Toward the end of the song, he asks his reluctant lover if they ""still want to freeze my verrucas?"" It's not appetizing, but then Trust Fund are at their best when they throw in a soured note or stall the pace just as a song threatens to get too comforting. Their tussle between coziness and dissonance betrays a surfeit of ambitious ideas, which isn't often a problem with modern indie rock acolytes.</p></div>"|21188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21188-seems-unfair/|6.8|Laura Snapes

At an early point in the development of hardcore, to have long hair and a leather jacket at certain shows came with a genuine risk of physical injury. But even hardcore flagships like Sick of It All, Agnostic Front, the Crumbsuckers, and the Cro-Mags put out albums that leaned towards metal, while other hardcore pioneers like D.R.I., Suicidal Tendencies, Corrosion of Conformity, and Prong all eventually transitioned fully into metal bands.</p>
<p>Despite these intertwined histories, though, it's easy to see why the division persists between these two camps: in general, metal encourages you to get carried away—be it by ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"" fantasy, exaggerated horror, Satan, or intellectual musing—while hardcore calls for you to keep your feet planted firmly on the ground. Hardcore bands also tend to fixate on their street credibility, to the point that their music functions as an incessant pledge of allegiance, which can be oppressive if you have no interest in relating to dogma of the lifestyle.</p>
<p><i>True Will</i>, the debut album from White Widows Pact, allows us to imagine a world where this division never existed. Citing Madball, Obituary, and Crowbar as its three primary influences, the Brooklyn quintet consciously tips its cap to the mid-'80s/early-'90s heyday of three different scenes—New York hardcore, Florida death metal, and southern sludge, respectively. In so doing, White Widows Pact reminds us that metal and hardcore were always perfectly suited for mating with each other and that, in fact, the two forms share the same DNA.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not like this is revelation in 2015. It's been over 25 years since Brutal Truth strode into the same tangle of sub-genres, eventually taking an <i>Edward Scissorhands</i> approach and carving them into new shapes. Countless bands have done the same, with varying degrees of creative innovation. Take even a quick glance at the Victory Records or Century Media catalog and you'll never run out of mosh breakdowns from bands fusing death metal with hardcore. Listening to <i>True Will</i>, though, it's obvious that White Widows Pact isn't trying to invent anything new. It's more like the band took scoops of three different ice cream varieties, let them melt in the same dish for a bit, and stirred them up into one uniform flavor.</p>
<p>Toward the beginning of the track ""Thirteen Years of War"", for example, White Widows Pact is able to infuse a palm-muted, death metal-style chug with the intangible—but unmistakable—urban swagger of hardcore. It's a subtle coloration, and it's hard to pinpoint how White Widows Pact does it, but every musical element on this album bears the distinct mark of a contrasting style. On the other hand, White Widows Pact's guitar solos hint at an awareness of scales gleaned from listening to King Diamond records, a musicality that most hardcore bands shun. </p>
<p> In blending these styles together until the lumps are smoothed out, the band gives <i>True Will</i> a seamless quality. And because the album presents itself without pretense, frontman David Castillo's lyrics cut that much deeper. On opening track ""Landlord"", Castillo (the co-owner of Brooklyn venue Saint Vitus Bar) rails against the owner of his tenement-slum apartment—a conventional enough target for hardcore-grade retaliation, but Castillo adds considerable dimension by casting the villain of the song as a clergyman.</p>
<p>Where Castillo follows the aggrieved, me-against-the-world hardcore model, he leans towards ambiguity where the majority of his peers would spell things out in the most obvious ways. The veteran narrator of ""Thirteen Years of War"", for example, harbors anger at a man in a suit. Castillo never elaborates on who that man is, or how literal he's being when he sings that the man ""lives next door."" With the music clanging away at full force, the songs become that much more powerful for what Castillo doesn't say.</p></div>"|21249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21249-true-will/|7.0|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

Reflecting on his own work as Oneohtrix Point Never, he noted, ""I tolerate dumb things sometimes in a kitschy way, but mostly in a sort of zen way, wherein stuff is suspended in a myopic ooze of raw nowness that is beautiful and gross at the same time.""</p>
<p>Ooze seeps from every pore of his new album, <i>Garden of Delete</i>: It is slathered all over the video for ""Sticky Drama"", and it erupts from the pustules of the adolescent humanoid alien, Ezra, who is the album's hero. The project spills over the limits of the album format, too, into rivulets of related texts—an array of videos, blogs, and Twitter accounts packed with surrealist Easter eggs that enhance the experience of the music in unusual ways. Ooze is formless, yet this album is deeply invested in questions of form. What invests music with value? Who creates hierarchical systems of taste? (I don't think it's a coincidence that the album title, abbreviated, alludes to the Supreme Being.)</p>
<p>The way <i>Garden of Delete</i> makes us question the assumptions behind all of our high/low binaries is part of its brilliance. OPN's music is generally understood to exist somewhere between nostalgia and irony, its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCToHe6w0iM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vaporwave fantasias</a> and unlikely <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RFunvF0mDw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">redemptions of '80s schlock-meisters like Chris DeBurgh</a> suggestive of late-night trips down YouTube rabbit holes. But we're not in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbqBXkmukr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chrome Country""</a> any more. <i>Garden of Delete</i> is unlike anything that Lopatin has done, in terms of technique, mood, or scope. It is denser than his previous albums, by several orders of magnitude. It is more varied, and it is funnier—scarier, too. So much beauty is crosscut with so much ugliness, and so much sincerity interwoven with so many deeply nested layers of kitsch, that the album carries with it a serious risk of whiplash, and that's as true on the 15th listen as on the first.</p>
<p>The album's base notes will be familiar from his previous work; they consist of cool, frictionless pads, airy choral presets, and, especially, synthesized sounds that mimic acoustic instruments and revel in their own plasticity, like the tinny player piano of ""Sticky Drama"", or the jazz guitar noodling of ""I Bite Through It"". This time out, he ventures even deeper into the uncanny valley separating ""real"" sounds from mimetic ones. The references pile up in enormous slag heaps, and a few in particular stand out: the growls, chugging guitars, and blast beats of death metal; the flanged riffs of nu metal; and the garish synth stabs and grotesque vocal processing of contemporary commercial electronic music. Two years ago, after a bout of touring, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9228-oneohtrix-point-never-right-brain/"">he told Pitchfork</a>, ""I feel like I better understand the tropes and guises of EDM now,"" and you can hear that familiarity at various points in <i>Garden of Delete</i>.</p>
<p>That's not to say the album is a collection of big-room bangers. But certain techniques common on the Electric Daisy circuit have wormed their way into the music: Elastic trance riffs, vertiginous glissandi that zip upward like space elevators, and, especially, the highly processed and contoured voices of which Skrillex is so fond. Nothing in <i>G.o.D. </i>follows the usual Pavlovian dictates of mainstream rave: There are builds and drops, but they're always deployed in ways that throw the listener off balance. Instead of EDM's predictable roller coaster, he's constructed something more like <a href=""http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Monument Valley</i></a>'s non-Euclidean architecture, where 2D and 3D spaces collapse into one another, and trapdoors open at the turn of a hidden dial.</p>
<p><i>Garden of Delete </i>is the first OPN album to come with a lyric sheet—no, really—which is nice, because the processed and distorted-to-hell ""singing"" on the album is mostly indecipherable. But even as a novelty, the lyrics sheet helps tease out the loose, extra-musical narrative developed across a range of apocrypha that orbit the album: a cryptic PDF of a crumpled sheet of paper in which Lopatin recounts, in the manner of a Joseph Conrad introduction, his encounter with a humanoid alien who gave him the USB containing the album's files; a <a href=""http://kaossed.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blogspot account</a> for said alien (with posts dated as far back as 1994) stuffed with aesthetic theory, <a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzrPN54CBf4/VbpybWNpDmI/AAAAAAAADUU/ubB2yMpLbLk/s1600/This%2Bworks%2Bso%2Bmuch%2Bbetter_6460f1_5294272.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jokes</a>, flyers for prog-rockers Rush, and musings on a style called ""hypergrunge""; a website for the (invented) hypergrunge band <a href=""http://kaossedgeofficial.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kaoss Edge</a>; a host of (active) <a href=""https://twitter.com/EzraKaossed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/KaossEdge"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">accounts</a> for all these characters; and various <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49EXKsu-jTs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mind-bending</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td-e4i2BL_Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">videos</a>. (Various phone numbers referenced are, alas, red herrings; one is for Spotify's support line, another the Winthrop, Mass., police department.) This may all seem, from the outside, like so much masturbatory energy spillage, but dig deep enough, and they all become part of the larger work. When, in an <a href=""http://kaossed.blogspot.com/2015/08/opn-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, Ezra asks Lopatin what hypergrunge represents to him, Lopatin answers, ""It's nihilist/formalist. Kaoss/Edge."" You couldn't ask for a more succinct summary of his music's underlying principles.  </p>
<p>None of this would matter if the music weren't absolutely gripping—strange, moving, hilarious, sometimes pushing the limits of good taste, but always in a way that makes you want to hear more. It is more songful than anything Lopatin has done. In ""Freaky Eyes"", minimalist organs give way to high-pitched voices in the style of Jack Ü; ""Ezra"" flits between the synth arpeggios of Rustie or Hudson Mohawke, Korn's nu-metal chug, and Japanese ambient; formally, it just kind of writhes in place, neither rising nor falling. ""SDFK"" interrupts graceful bells and strings with a crushing death-metal interlude that abruptly falls silent. And if Trevor Horn ever produced Slayer, it might sound something like ""Sticky Drama"". Your favorites will probably change over time, but the apocalyptic trance of ""I Bite Through It"" is a good candidate for the album's highlight, the vantage point from which all the surrounding chaos begins to make sense. </p>
<p>It all clicked for me one Sunday morning in the pre-dawn stillness of the city. Returning from seeing off a family member at the airport at an ungodly hour, I listened to <i>G.o.D. </i>on headphones for the duration of the ride back to the city center. Descending from the bus, I found myself standing in front of a Hard Rock Cafe where two enormous video screens flashed senselessly away above the sidewalk, their pixelated images moving almost in time with the album's throbbing synthesizers. As Lopatin's textures stretched and spasmed in my ears, artificial light poured out onto the empty street in ungainly bursts, like tiny droplets of the ongoing heat death of the universe. It was garish and gorgeous all at once, a vision of capitalism at its tackiest accompanied by a soundtrack at once cutting and strangely empathic, and for several minutes I just stood there, transfixed by the raw, oozing nowness of it all.</p></div>"|21108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21108-garden-of-delete/|8.7|Philip Sherburne

""To me it goes all the way back to being in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3971-the-sugarcubes/"">the Sugarcubes</a> and Kukl before,"" she told Britain's <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/exclusive-interview-the-mistress-of-reinvention-bj-rk-remixes-herself-yet-again-for-her-new-album-8320364.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Independent</i></a>. She described how Iceland's half-arsed indie scene was suddenly electrified by the arrival of acid house: ""Going to all those first raves, it was really obvious that there wasn't really one correct way of doing a song."" That notion reached a peak on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15915-biophilia/""><i>Biophilia</i></a>, where, if the mood struck, Björk could have dispatched endless revisions of the record to the corresponding app (which always sounded more like a <i>Synecdoche, New York</i>-style nightmare than a healthy creative impulse). At home, her audience could tinker with the music at will.</p>
<p>Even though its predecessor was rooted in ideas around organic matter and mutation, this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20181-vulnicura/""><i>Vulnicura</i></a> felt more like a living process than any of Björk's previous records. The tracklist was a linear path through the collapse of her 13-year relationship, and its devastating fallout. The liner notes dated the songs according to their distance from the emotional chasm at its center, embodied by the 10-minute ""Black Lake"". Its length reflected the difficult process of trying to articulate and move on from abstract, muddled pain, she <a href=""http://grapevine.is/mag/feature/2015/02/06/bjorks-folk-music/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a>, and her elongated vowels seemed to massage out that meaning.</p>
<p><i>Vulnicura Strings</i> takes the record back to the very beginning of the process, where Björk threw herself into writing complex arrangements for strings as a way of coping after the split. The addition of subtly powerful beats added to the record's sense of rupture, evoking an arrhythmic heart and blowing circuits that left darkness in their sputtering wake. Removing them should result in a rawer incarnation of <i>Vulnicura</i>, but this sounds more like a suturing. The original's broken-ness is gone, in its place an undisturbed tragic whole. </p>
<p>Although some listeners may have found the electronic instrumentation distracting, <i>Vulnicura Strings—</i>a remake of the album using only strings, and jettisoning electronics—isn't necessarily an easier listen. It's more intense for the sense of space, which enhances Björk's cavernous, anguished vowels and sometimes accusatory tone. The ensemble's queasy, acidic qualities also stand out. <span>These aren't always the original recordings, but closer mic'd takes, a subtle difference that gives the record a slightly uncanny quality, aided by the rearranged tracklist. </span>The vast, trembling edifice of ""Atom Dance"" is stunning in isolation, while the spaces in ""Black Lake"" seem to linger even longer, with a kind of awkward tranquility. The lyrics are stripped out of ""Family"" in favor of highlighting its two piercing, frantic crescendos.</p>
<p>A lot of these songs didn't have hooks, per se, to start with. They expanded and contracted with a kind of cosmic swarm, the percussion providing a delicate skeleton. Loose as it was, without that punctuation, <i>Vulnicura Strings</i> can feel a little formless. A second version of ""Black Lake"" was performed in Krakow, Poland, on the world's only viola organista, an instrument designed by Leonardo da Vinci but not built until after his death. On a technical level, it's intriguing: a friction belt vibrates individual strings, which are selected by pressing keys on a keyboard. But as a listening experience, it's a bit arduous. The instrument has a rasping, atonal quality, and the spaces in the song drone on forever without offering much.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that <i>Vulnicura Strings</i> will replace anyone's original copy of the record—its existence feels more symbolic than anything else. Last week, NASA <a href=""http://www.blastr.com/2015-11-4/nasa-just-saw-something-come-out-black-hole-first-time-ever"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">observed</a> the supermassive black hole Markarian 335 emitting energy for the first time. ""This will help us understand how supermassive black holes power some of the brightest objects in the universe,"" said astrophysicist Dan Wilkins. For Björk to return to the disintegration of her family once again and make something new from it, however successful it is, is further proof of the life that can be found in destruction.</p></div>"|21232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21232-vulnicura-strings/|6.8|Laura Snapes

They appear to be in motion, rippled by an unseen hand. The imagery evokes Peter Saville’s iconic cover for<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/""> Joy Division</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11624-unknown-pleasurescloserstill/"">Unknown Pleasures</a>, </i>another picture of linear stability disrupted. For the New York ensemble PC Worship—led by Justin Frye, who’s credited with the cover art—the uncannily destabilized image aptly introduces a full-length fixated on repetition, but with none of its usual comforting familiarity. Instead, <i>Basement Hysteria </i>restates riffs until listeners reach a dissociative threshold, a kind of aural vertigo.</p>
<p>If that sounds something like a tenet of minimalist composition, it’s no coincidence. The members of PC Worship seem like self-taught students of 20th-century avant-garde. The shifting lineup, which Frye has helmed since the late 2000s, incorporates circuit bending, tape manipulation, harsh noise, and field recordings. Their songs do not sound intended for replication. There’s too much improvisation, especially in the braying brass caterwaul, and the home recordings welcome environmental intrusions. And yet, last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19845-pc-worship-social-rust/""><i>Social Rust </i></a>indicated a subtle departure. Still saturated with queasy dissonance, its songs hewed closer to conventional lengths and structures. PC Worship’s latest, however,<i> </i>makes no such concessions. </p>
<p><i>Basement Hysteria </i>features four songs at over a half hour. The ostensible single, in so far as it was posted ahead of the release date, exceeds 13 minutes. Vital signs like that register less like an album or an EP and more like a statement: If <i>Social Rust </i>flirted with the common indie rock narrative about experimentalism capitulating to accessibility then <i>Basement Hysteria </i>is a harsh rebuff. It’s bristly, difficult, and unaccommodating. Here, rock'n'roll is a pirated vessel, steered unhurriedly toward doom.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Basement Hysteria </i>begins with a song called ""Done"". It’s easy to mistake the horns for a wailing baby. Some pundit babbles on a muddled radio or television. Piano—a detuned, unenthused clang—serves as the dreary pulse of this urban soundscape, but the rest of the album takes place underground. ""Where am I/ Where am I/ I’m in my head when I should be outside,"" Frye groans later in the song, his delivery by that time a weary echo of the sluggish drumbeat. The title track, perhaps the only rudderless inclusion, sounds like little more than one-handed drumming and tuning peg abuse. On ""Social Fiction"", however, PC Worship compellingly recalls tour-mates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30746-naomi-punk/"">Naomi Punk</a>; both bands know the value of a slow, syncopated pummel. Only, Frye’s group textures leaden might with total scree. </p>
<p>The tracks conclude unceremoniously, with a coughing fit, or protracted instrumental decay. Resolution is for pop, or songs intended for an audience; part of <i>Basement Hysteria’</i>s appeal is an illusion: listeners are among the privileged few who get invited deep down below. And it’s convincing. A centerpiece of sorts, ""My Lens"" is a procession of seemingly discrete sections. High tones wail siren-like before a morose, spare passage of acoustic guitar and murmured poetics. It best conveys the simmering mania of <i>Basement Hysteria, </i>where<i> </i>obsession induces befuddlement and simple things grow unnatural features under prolonged examination. </p></div>"|21142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21142-basement-hysteria/|7.8|Sam Lefebvre

And while it's the lynchpin of fellow UK producer Paul Woolford's work under the alias Special Request, it never sounds like an exercise in revisiting those old sounds. Perhaps Woolford's sensibilities come from approaching 40 and experiencing British rave culture firsthand. As he <a href=""http://tankmagazine.com/issue-59/radio/paul-woolford"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">put it in an old interview</a>, Woolford instead seeks to revel in ""a false memory"" in broadcasting tracks over an FM channel and then sampling the results as if it's his very own pirate radio station. </p>
<p>Being coy, playful, or evocative doesn't much factor into the nine tracks gathered up as <i>Modern Warfare</i> EPs 1-3. Much like fellow labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/"">Zomby</a>, Woolford released these EPs simultaneously on the <a href=""http://xlrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">XL Recordings</a> imprint this week. And while both Zomby and Woolford posit them as ""DJ tools,"" meaning they're for smashing dancefloors rather than home listening, the latter's end results are far more invigorating. One wouldn't soon mistake his rave/breakbeat/pirate radio-infused tracks for mawkishness, as he keeps the edges rough, the drive relentless, and the breaks concussive. Truth in advertising, <i>Modern Warfare</i> is a dancefloor weapon.</p>
<p>Putting the title track first feels slightly off, only in the sense that slowing down frantic breakbeats to house tempos doesn't do much for the relatively brief track. ""Amnesia"" treads a similar path, the snares feeling sluggish at 126 BPM. And when Woolford peels away the bass wobbles until it's just a piano line and a female voice bloodlessly saying ""Come together/ We'll make it work,"" it smacks of the sort of soulless vocal house currently filling up innumerable Mixcloud and YouTube playlists.</p>
<p>But after those early missteps, Woolford finally locks in on ""Reset It"". Even with its faux pirate DJ shout-out and hokey backspin effects, the track transcends with a heady mix of adrenaline and ecstasy. The spare-but-brutal ""Damage"" builds from a nasty hi-hat pattern and soulful plea, each increasing in urgency and dub effects, suggesting a rubble-strewn landscape. Highlight ""Take Me"" finally approaches the velocity of old-school breakbeat but with a techno twist. These are peak-hour tracks meant for elevating a packed club to the next level and it almost feels like a crime to review them on an office stereo.</p>
<p>Despite the ambient opening, ""Peak Dub"" repurposes the <a href=""https://youtu.be/qwQLk7NcpO4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Amen break""</a> for the millionth time with little to distinguish it, though that break fares far better in the context of ""Tractor Beam"", finding more snares and woozy noises to helix around it. While not the same immersive album listen as Woolford's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18621-special-request-soul-music/""><i>Soul Music</i></a> album from two years back, <i>Modern Warfare</i>'s incredibly high peaks double as incendiary bombs and guilty pleasures.</p></div>"|21229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21229-modern-warfare-eps-1-3/|7.3|Andy Beta

For a quarter century, they've been building hour-long piano/drums/bass pieces that overflow with the tension of contrasts—beauty versus bedlam, melody versus discord, momentum versus inertia. Live, the Sydney trio do it off the cuff, shaping tiny themes with familiar tools into improvised monoliths. Though the Necks draft more concrete plans for their records, they wield that same sense of wonder when they’re composing. At their best, the group’s albums sound meticulous but <i>feel </i>extemporaneous, like synchronized exhalations from a group whose chemistry suggests rock'n'roll’s best songwriting tandems. Made by just three musicians of ostensibly modest avant-garde-scene means, the Necks’ sets and records possess the same gripping power as a sitcom or documentary that might have cost millions of dollars and dozens of people to craft. The largely acoustic answer to New Zealand’s electric <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5096-the-dead-c/"">the Dead C</a>, the Necks make miracles of efficiency and magnetism.</p>
<p><i>Vertigo </i>is the Necks’ 18th album and second for the New York label <a href=""http://northernspyrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Northern Spy</a>, the group’s first stable American home. Like many of its predecessors, <i>Vertigo</i> runs as one uninterrupted track, with 44 minutes roughly split between two interwoven movements. It does, however, break from the past by increasing the role of roaring electric guitar (played by drummer Tony Buck) and wafting-and-hiccupping synthesizers and electronic accessories (played by pianist Chris Abrahams). These additions largely shape a drone that fluctuates throughout the album and serves as a springboard for the group’s convulsive repartee. The exact nature of the sustained tone changes: <i>Vertigo </i>begins, for instance, with the growl of Lloyd Swanton’s bowed bass and dense sheets of piano runs. Near the halfway point, though, it’s a high-pitched synthesizer purr, countered by a Wurlitzer organ whose every chord dissipates into space. Swanton emerges from the impasse with steady, resonant bass sweeps, briefly conjuring the spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/816-tony-conrad/"">Tony Conrad</a>’s microtonal masterpieces. And just before track’s end, an organ, bass, and Buck’s scraped drums cohere into a gigantic sigh, so slow and resonant it suggests plate tectonics.</p>
<p>But these interlocking phases are only the undercarriage of <i>Vertigo</i>, the framework upon which the Necks’ usual, brilliant instrumental interplay moves. When Abrahams inlays beautifully ascending melodies inside Buck’s percussive din early on, the effect is magical. And when Buck divides Swanton’s long, bagpipe-like tones with a stuttering, trip-hop rhythm, you listen in anticipation, trying to foretell what might happen next, only to be surprised by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3111-naked-city/"">Naked City</a>-style ruptures Buck soon bangs out. This is the Necks at their finest, playing group games of chutes and ladders and delighting in their instrumental ideas like they’re dancing.</p>
<p>But <i>Vertigo</i> does stumble slightly through its rather obvious series of arcs: An opening swell cedes to a comedown that sends the members out into space, only to reconvene a quarter-hour later. This back-and-forth motion defines much of <i>Vertigo</i> and, by record’s end, it gets a bit tedious. And, in part because of the underpinning drone around which the trio works, the Necks are busier and more restless here than in the past, sometimes moving as if trapped inside a pinball machine. The Necks typically make elliptical music, where restraint and suggestion power tension and momentum. Their last album, 2013’s <i>Open</i>, epitomized that. <i>Vertigo</i>, on the other hand,<i> </i>could do more with less—of, say, the tawdry horror-show electronics so prominent near the 12-minute mark or the shock-and-awe noise that populates the back half. The concept of working over and alongside a drone congests the Necks’ customary grace.</p>
<p>The Necks have always confounded easy taxonomy. Their piano-trio semblance has often shoehorned them into jazz circles, though their pronounced lack of swing and structure has infamously <a href=""http://www.spin.com/2013/10/the-necks-ambient-jazz-triumph-open-northern-spy/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">confounded critics in those circles</a>. And though there seems to be a natural spot for the Necks in experimental spaces, their presentation—three middle-aged men playing expensive acoustic instruments, often in esteemed concert halls—can make them a strange fit for the underground crowd. Their love of extended pieces and clattering crescendos even suggests a place in post-rock, though their music is often too incidental and illusory for the templates that term implies. With its part-time, eerie <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a> glow and sudden noise-rock spasms, <i>Vertigo</i> only renders the Necks as more vexing and unidentifiable. Though the Necks occasionally slip into predictability across this session, <i>Vertigo</i> epitomizes their career-long unpredictability, or their ability to start at one point and arrive somewhere entirely unexpected. <i>Vertigo </i>is a minor Necks record, destined to stand forever in the shadow of the 2013 opus <i>Open</i>. But, after a quarter century, the trio’s explorations still sound as ecstatic as they do limitless. That, at least, is another minor miracle. </p></div>"|21133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21133-vertigo/|7.7|Grayson Haver Currin

But in the <i>AMY: The Original Soundtrack</i>, Amy Winehouse is actually outnumbered: her 11 B-sides are broken up evenly by 11 snippets of film score, with the balance tipped by one exceedingly unnecessary trip-hop track, originally released in 1995.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is not for lack of material. Winehouse began her public singing career at age 16 with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, performing and recording regularly for the next decade until her death. She's already had one posthumous compilation album (2011's poorly named, respectability-minded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16112-lioness-hidden-treasures/""><i>Lioness: Hidden Treasures</i></a>), but if the tracks available on YouTube are any indication<span>—</span>let alone the unreleased professional recordings that her still-active fanbase lists and obsesses over on <a href=""https://www.amywinehouseforum.co.uk/forum/topic/19556-what-are-all-the-unreleased-songs-by-amy/page-4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">message boards</a><span>—t</span>here are plenty of demos, live versions, and discarded mixes left. <i>AMY: The Original Soundtrack</i>, however, contains only one true ""new"" recording. ""We're Still Friends"", performed live at the Union Chapel in 2006, shows Winehouse on the cusp between her peak and downfall; the recording is precise and elegant, and she wears her strung-out voice like a crown.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The rest of the soundtrack is a mix of album cuts and live recordings, compiled primarily as signposts for the documentary's plot. There is no raw audio on the soundtrack whatsoever; it's much glossier than the film itself, which heavily relies on rough footage and successfully illuminates Winehouse outside her press narrative as a result. In <i>AMY</i>, it's arresting to watch her so unguarded, putting her makeup on in a bar bathroom before a gig, giving a tour of her apartment in character as a haughty maid. Her talent flames into incandescence and out of it; her flesh shrinks into bone. She's frequently captured singing in the film, from ""Happy Birthday"" at a friend's house to that gruesome final show in Belgrade, where she was essentially walking dead.<b> </b>The collage is forceful, and in context you barely notice that the film is scored at all.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The soundtrack, then, serves as your reminder. Antonio Pinto, who wrote the music for both <i>City of God </i>and <i>City of Men</i>, even has the opening track. It's a minimal, mournful minute of piano. ""This is sad, remember,"" the song says. ""What's about to happen is very, very solemn."" But could there be anything that requires saying less?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Presumably, the instrumental interludes are meant to give her tragic arc some breathing room, like asterisks that break up a story. But one of the best things about the <i>AMY</i> documentary is that its pacing feels so natural—invisibly punishing, just like life. The effect of this soundtrack is exactly the opposite. The power of her voice is undercut by the regular intrusion of the film score, which doesn't reference her musically in palette or instrumentation. As a result, the album feels like a powerful hand clasping a limp one. Winehouse had an essential personal relentlessness, which her audience reflected back at her, and the soundtrack to a movie that climaxes at her death has no right to hide or diminish that.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Everyone already knew that Winehouse was a genius vocalist. To its credit, this collection highlights her sardonic writing, choosing songs where she translated her life cuttingly, always with a twist. She was happy to<b> </b>project her true self outward just enough to disguise it as a persona; she was stuck on the same themes of self-aggrandizement and self-diminishment, and she was almost supernaturally ahead of the story. As her pianist says in the documentary, she ""needed music like a person, and would die for it""—and she was ready to, and did. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmZp8pR1uc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rehab""</a> was a distraction by way of being right on the nose; her many admissions (""It's not just my pride, it's just 'til these tears have dried"") made us complicit. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10032-back-to-black/"">Back to Black</a> </i>uses depression as a euphemism for heroin in the title. Even ""Tears Dry on Their Own"", her black-swan sequel to ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", contains a withdrawal metaphor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The latter is reproduced in its original album version on </span><i>AMY</i><span>, which is fine, because what does a rarity mean in the age of YouTube, anyway? What could be new, in this context, when the star in question was hounded to death by demons so public we all saw her crack pipe and paparazzi so relentless that they slept outside her house? This soundtrack album doesn't even seem aware of those questions, and like any album bearing Amy Winehouse's name from 2011 onwards, it's a diminishment—this time severe.</span></p></div>"|21214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21214-amy-the-original-soundtrack/|5.4|Jia Tolentino

Still, until now, it remained unclear whether he could broaden the scope of his talents beyond a song-by-song basis, channeling the constant spray of ideas into something built to last. <i>Slime Season 2</i> edges further in that direction, a more carefully constructed work than its predecessor in every sense. And in small but significant bursts, it’s the first of his releases to begin to flesh out a real idea of Jeffrey Williams beyond the blinding veneer of experimentation. This is the sound of 2015’s most dazzling bar-for-bar rapper hitting his stride.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s a noticeable improvement over September’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21099-slime-season/""><i>Slime Season</i></a>, but not because Thug’s rapping is evolving at that speed. Both projects are culled from archives of work presumably stretching back at least a year; there is almost no hint of chronology among these tracks. But where <i>SS1</i> felt rambling and uneven, there is a clear sense of purpose to <i>SS2</i>, applying the cohesion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20529-barter-6/""><i>Barter 6</i></a> to <i>SS1</i>’s pop promise. His engineer Alex Tumay executive produced the project, and Thug benefits greatly from an editor: <i>SS2</i> is nearly an hour and a half long, but it flows. The mood is woozy and nocturnal, Thug’s adlibs serving as his own echo in some damp subterranean cave. The production roster ranges from Atlanta’s most wanted (Metro Boomin, Southside, London On Da Track) to lesser-known collaborator Goose and—out of nowhere—Fool’s Gold blogwave holdover <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28879-treasure-fingers/"">Treasure Fingers</a>, but all of their contributions blend into the tape’s murky cool.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Thug's lyrics are studded with the glorious non sequiturs you expect: baffling asteroids of one-liners, orbiting in isolation, that either mean nothing or hint at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UwP0PCRIA4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vast cosmological secrets</a>. (""I look good as your dad on a Friday,"" from ""Thief in the Night"", is probably the former; ""A wise man told me nothing,"" from tape standout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17797-young-thug-raw-might-just/"">""Raw (Might Just)""</a>, is unquestionably the latter.) But <i>SS2</i>’s most exciting developments are the rare moments Thug lowers his guard and focuses inward—something that’s only happened in glimpses until now. He darts between flashes of nostalgia, frank meditations on faithfulness and jealousy, nuggets of formative family history: ""My nephew saw his daddy sent out home to the sky,"" he recalls on the queasy, wobbling ""Beast"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the moment that’s burned into my skull comes in the first verse of ""Never Made Love"", a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31919-rich-homie-quan/"">Rich Homie Quan</a> duet left over from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19901-birdman-young-thug-rich-homie-quan-tha-tour-part-1/"">Rich Gang</a> era. Quan brings pathos to the hook and gets out of the way: The song's main attraction is Thug’s sincere and complicated grappling with defensive detachment that taps into a well of long-buried family trauma. With it comes perhaps the most vulnerable and mystically cogent mini-narrative of his entire catalog, one I can’t help but quote in full: ""My lookout man was my right-hand man, but he was wrong, though/ Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor’s porch/ And it was her/ She had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent/ She had the same exact face as my brother’s nurse/ And he in a hearse/ I never looked at it for what it’s worth."" It’s pure poetry.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Critics have called Thug’s music surrealist, but </span><i>SS2</i><span> presents him instead as a storyteller in the magical realist tradition, drawing glimmers of nonplussed fascination out of the rational world. Within this context, his habit for working in small-scale, occasionally disjointed bursts, recording each line spontaneously, makes perfect sense. His thoughts fracture and wander down unpredictable paths, forcing us to draw connections in non-linear ways.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At its core, magical realism suggests that the ultimate mystery in a logical world is man himself; its soft mysticism is a roundabout path to the heart. Above even the muddy, waterlogged sonics, the unifying thread here is intimacy. <i>SS2</i> has Thug more transparent on love, trust, and heartbreak than ever before: ""She Notice"" and ""Hey, I"" stand out above the rest, unguarded and earnest and complicated as ever. He cheats, he stumbles, and then he attempts to deconstruct his own behavior, tracing the tangled roots of how 2015 rap’s greatest enigma came to be. Nearing the end of a landmark year, we still talk about Thug as a mystery: as transcending language, or as the ultimate triumph of style over substance. But the last thing we hear on <i>SS2</i>, closing out a chopped and screwed version of previously leaked ballad ""Love Me Forever"", is a hopeful yelp: ""And I just wanna be loved!"" It doesn’t get clearer, or more human, than that.</p></div>"|21262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21262-slime-season-2/|7.9|Meaghan Garvey

Much of the ebullience of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" derives from its AM-radio friendly arrangement, a sound encouraged by Bert Berns, the head of Van's label Bang. Berns was determined to get the record on the charts because that's where the money was, so the single sounded peppier than its lyric, a disconnect Morrison later noted. An undercurrent of melancholy desire runs through ""Brown Eyed Girl""—Van pines for a moment as it's passing—and <i>Astral Weeks</i> brings that yearning to the forefront as it ventures into the slipstream of memories, dreams, and regret.</p>
<p>Generalized longing—for a lover or a friend, for a certain time or place, for a younger version of yourself—is one of the defining elements of <i>Astral Weeks</i>, an album where spirituality, mysticism, and death intertwine on a vast expanding plane. It is youthful and old, the first flowering of expanded consciousness, one not yet tarnished by either tragedy or cynicism but impeded by an encroaching sense of mortality. Death flows through the album but doom doesn't cloud each moment. Rather, this music comes from the perspective of a young man realizing everything he has will erode, an awareness arriving while the wonder of life has yet to fade. Morrison doesn't dwell upon such sadness so much as he brushes upon them, a sensibility mirrored in his open-ended songs—compositions that largely evade traditional structure in favor of a boundless ballad, one stripped of story but following an interior emotional narrative. There's reason why both its creator and admirers so often call <i>Astral Weeks</i> poetry: it has its own internal language.</p>
<p>Other singer/songwriters wound up using <i>Astral Weeks</i> as a primary text, either discovering their own voice in its viaducts or wallowing in its detours, but nobody has approached its soft, untethered spirituality, not even Van Morrison himself. In a way, Morrison's occasional disregard for the record helped fuel its cult, suggesting he tapped into a vein that frightened even him (this is a common thread among cult albums, where audiences choose to live eternally within a few dark months of an artist's life; see also <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>'s <i>Third</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>'s <i>Pinkerton</i>). Certainly, <i>Astral Weeks</i> seems to exist in a separate dimension from the rest of Van Morrison's catalog, its supple, soft-focus jazz-folk lacking the deeper R&amp;B grooves of so many of his records, while its songs are often absent on compilations (tellingly, there's not a single song from it on the artist-endorsed 2007 compilation, <i>Still on Top—The Greatest Hits</i>). All of which underscores its separateness, playing into the myths that <i>Astral Weeks </i>is a record out of time and place.</p>
<p>But even this, the most mystical album in the classic rock canon, has prosaic beginnings. Although it gives the illusion that it was written as a piece, several of its songs were composed years earlier (""Ballerina"" dates from 1966, when Them recorded a prescient version of Dylan's ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue""), with Morrison recording two of the songs—""Beside You"" and ""Madame George""—for Bang Records during a day-long 1967 session designed to deliver all 36 songs he owed the label. This patchwork assemblage wasn't an accident. Part of the condition for Morrison's departure from the imprint dictated that he record two Bang-era songs for his Warner debut and, if Morrison released a single in 1968, half of the copyright would belong to Berns' publishing company. Morrison had radio-friendly material at the ready—""Domino"", the lead single from the subsequent <i>His Band and the Street Choir</i>, was kicking around in '68—but he deliberately saved these songs for a later date, choosing contemplative compositions that were frankly uncommercial. Critics and Morrison himself would occasionally lament the album's lack of promotion but that underselling seems a deliberate tactic: there were no singles by design and both the artist and Warner would benefit financially if the hits arrived somewhere down the road.</p>
<p>Hence, <i>Astral Weeks</i> is a bit of conventional artist building by Warner, a label known for being artist-friendly. Where Bang sought to shoehorn Morrison into the confines of AM radio, Warner's Mo Ostin and Joe Smith indulged their new signing, teaming him with producer Lewis Merenstein, who recruited a band of jazz players led by bassist Richard Davis, a veteran of out sessions by Andrew Hill (he played on every one of the pianist's pivotal mid-'60s Blue Note titles) and Eric Dolphy, but also straighter sessions by Brother Jack McDuff and Lou Donaldson. Modern Jazz Quartet drummer Connie Kay came next, along with guitarist Jay Berliner and vibraphonist/percussionist Warren Smith Jr., both veterans of sessions with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13106-charles-mingus/"">Charles Mingus</a>, and the group simply followed the lead of Morrison, who was playing the songs while sequestered in his separate booth. Three days—just two longer than the Bang copyright dump—was all that was needed to finish the record, with four songs completed the first day of the session. Morrison later <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101249415"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> NPR in 2009 ""That was that performance on those days"" and, in a way, that's all that needs to be said about the record: it is musicians, previously unknown to each other, discovering a shared vernacular, stumbling upon something transcendent that no party attempted to conjure again.</p>
<p><i>Astral Weeks</i> is defined by Morrison's transient collaborations, not only between the musicians in the studio but producer Merenstein. So distinct is its atmosphere, it's easy to assume this is the work of a lone auteur who crafted the compositions and arrangements, but Merenstein is the one who sequenced the album, imposing the designations ""In the Beginning"" and ""Afterwards"" to the two sides, thereby strengthening the illusion that this is a song cycle. He's also the one who directed the orchestrations and chose to clip ""Slim Slow Slider"" so the album shudders to a halt, the dream coming to a conclusion with a start.</p>
<p>The long-rumored complete version of ""Slim Slow Slider"" is one of four bonus tracks added to Warner's new remastered and expanded reissue of <i>Astral Weeks</i>; the other three include a longer version of ""Ballerina"" and alternate takes on ""Beside You"" and ""Madame George"", the latter with no orchestration and heavy vibes, offering a muted variation on the original. ""Slim Slow Slider"" does feel different in its lengthier incarnation, where it now glides to a gentler conclusion with Morrison trading lines with John Payne's saxophone, an effect that lends a slightly hopeful edge to an otherwise harrowing song. Perhaps this is closer to the author's intent—when Morrison performed <i>Astral Weeks</i> live at the Hollywood Bowl in 2009 he inserted the song in the middle of the set, softening its impact—or perhaps not; as Van says, either album is nothing more than a snapshot of a moment, the way those songs were performed on that day by that singer. This essential ephemera means this longer version of ""Slim Slow Slider"", along with its companion alternate takes, are mere grace notes to an album that ultimately can not be illuminated, only experienced.</p>
<p><i>His Band and the Street Choir</i>, the other Van Morrison album receiving an expanded treatment in this inaugural series of deluxe reissues, stands as something of a counter to the heady <i>Astral Weeks</i>: it is all about the rough and tumble joy of living. Delivered almost immediately after the breakthrough of <i>Moondance</i>—that record came out in January 1970, <i>His Band</i> arrived in November of that year—<i>His Band and the Street Choir</i><i> </i>is the first of Morrison's albums where the production is credited entirely to the man himself. He elbowed Merenstein aside during the recording of <i>Moondance</i> when the producer sought to bring in the <i>Astral Weeks</i> band for a second round—the veteran retained an executive producer credit—and Morrison labored over that album, recording for three months and work-shopping material in the studio. </p>
<p><i><i>His Band and the Street Choi</i>r</i> bore a similarly lengthy creative process but the album gives an illusion of buoyant immediacy thanks in no small part to its heavy R&amp;B kick. Where <i>Moondance</i> traded in jazz—even its liveliest moment was named after a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14299-duke-ellington/"">Duke Ellington</a> song—<i>His Band and the Street Choir </i>relied on soul and gospel, using folk almost as an accent. ""I'll Be Your Lover, Too"" and ""Virgo Clowns"" almost offer respites from the raucous rhythms of ""Domino"", ""Blue Money"", and ""Call Me Up in Dreamland"", songs that sound joyous no matter what their topic (and, in the case of the two singles, they're likely about separation and nude modeling, not exactly rousing topics). When Morrison claimed <i>Astral Weeks</i> sounded ""samey"" in latter-day interviews, he had a point: it was variations on a theme, whereas <i>His Band and the Street Choir</i> shoehorns celebration, sweet melancholy, and reflection into 12 songs. Perhaps this doesn't make for a spiritually transcendent record but it is an album of sustenance, providing sustained pleasures for times of joy and sorrow. </p></div>"|21092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21092-astral-weeks-his-band-and-the-street-choir/|10.0|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

For Knight, Ra's otherworldly musings are irrelevant: He picks the sample because <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> uses the same audio clip to end <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"">Madvillainy</a></i>'s absurdist ""Shadows of Tomorrow"". Knight's connection to the 2004 classic ends there: His narrative-driven lyrics don't resemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"">MF DOOM</a>'s post-modern syllabic wordplay in the slightest. But by leading with an obvious and familiar sample, he indicates to the listener where his hip-hop allegiances lie. Unlike fellow <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30965-pro-era/"">Pro Era</a> member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"">Joey Bada$$</a>, Knight doesn't try to compete with his more accomplished forebears. At its best and its worst, <i>Late Knight Special</i> is an unassuming project.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That opening track, ""Start Running"", encapsulates much of its su</span><span>ccesses and shortcomings. Knight flows smoothly and competently, but hardly any notable lines emerge, and he spends much of the song simply telling the listener that he is rapping, which doesn't work without artful twists of wordplay. It's the song's production—Knight's forte—that makes ""Start Running"" worthwhile: The light hi-hats allude to boom bap, but Knight manages to avoid copycat '90s-worship. Throughout the album, Knight shows that although he's learned from the past, he's not living in it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The more daring Knight gets with his production, the more interesting </span><i>Late Knight Special</i><span> becomes. When he cranks up the bass and ventures into the minor key, he gets more intense on the microphone and sharpens his focus. </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/proeraradio/kirk-knight-brokeland-prod-by-kirk-knight"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Brokeland""</span></a><span>, for example, very much recalls </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/""><span>Wu-Tang Clan</span></a><span>'s ""C.R.E.A.M."", complete with a send-off from Knight that ""everybody know that money is the root of all evil."" The song is also built on an obscure </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/RPejOSZSPiQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Italian harpsichord sample</span></a><span> of which </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/""><span>RZA</span></a><span> would surely be proud. Knight's lyrics focus on concrete details: ""</span><span>With the Hammer pants, I keep security cards in my sneakers."" The tales from the block—which have the potential for honesty and insight—suit Knight well.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">During a mid-album suite of poppier love songs (""One Knight"", ""Scorpio"", and ""Down""), Knight makes the hooks his focus. He actually has quite a knack for choruses and half-sings most of them himself. The accompanying bars, however, fail to register. As the album comes to a close with a series of deeper, more ponderous songs, the earworm hooks disappear and the beats remain relaxed, leaving Knight to hold attention with his bars. Ultimately, his Chicago guests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32461-mick-jenkins/"">Mick Jenkins</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33139-noname-gypsy/"">Noname Gypsy</a> end up making as much, if not more, of an impression. On <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/proeraradio/kirk-knight-dead-friends-ft-nonamegypsy-thundercat-prod-by-kirk-knight"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dead Friends""</a>, for instance, which also features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a> on bass, Knight meanders his way into a story about an older friend who had taken him under his wing; he later finds out secondhand that the friend died. It's a thoughtful sentiment, but lacks urgency. Noname, on the same track, jumps in with biblical, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2040-billie-holiday/"">Billie Holiday</a>, and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"">Yeezus</a></i> allusions in her first two lines. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Kirk Knight's rapping career is very much nascent. Before this debut, his biggest look as a rapper was probably his guest verse on Joey's 2013 </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15659-amethyst-rockstar/""><span>""Amethyst Rockstar""</span></a><span>. It's as a producer where Knight's had plenty of opportunities to excel. He's got credits on legitimately popular songs, such as Joey's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56167-joey-bada-shares-new-single-big-dusty/"">""Big Dusty""</a>. This imbalance shows through on <i>Late Knight Special, </i>for better and for worse. The whole thing </span><span><i>s</i>ounds crisp and determined, but he hasn't yet showed us why he deserves to be center stage of his own productions yet.</span></p></div>"|21132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21132-late-knight-special/|6.4|Matthew Strauss

Though <i>Dealer </i>is an artistic triumph and a significant advance from <i>The Albatross</i>, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor. And that's why, from its very first second, Murphy sounds drained over the prospect of doing it all over again—<i>Dealer </i>is not an easy listen. It sounds like it was very difficult to make, and reliving it is going to be even harder.</p>
<p>It's in Foxing's nature to welcome a challenge. Of all the leading figures in the <a href=""http://thefestfl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fest</a>-centered post-emo world, they made the most demanding, unique and self-assured debut. It certainly earned the genre tag—silvery guitar figures streaked and twinkled like tiny <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky"">Explosions in the Sky</a>, while Murphy's keening vocals delivered confrontational and caustic lyrics with spasmodic, burst-and-bloom dynamics. To paraphrase the slow-motion self-evisceration of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16480-rory/"">""Rory""</a> (think the Wrens' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF0cLA1kRjg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Is Not What You Had Planned""</a> stretched to four minutes), he ripped his heart out while it was still beating and shoved it directly in your face. But Foxing are more interested in a renaissance than a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/325-evan-weiss-emo-revival"">""revival""</a>, and they mirror the adaptive and forward-thinking qualities of their scene, creating a new voice for familiar sentiments: There was certainly hints of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/677-capn-jazz/"">Cap'n Jazz</a> on <i>Albatross</i>, but also <i>actual</i> jazz, as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a>' baroque Americana and touches of avant-garde R&amp;B.</p>
<p><i>The Albatross</i> darted fitfully and stretched out in all directions, while <i>Dealer</i> pulls all of Foxing's influences inward. Inverting his typical role of making burly post-rock bands sound delicate, producer Matt Bayles (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"">Isis</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31775-caspian/"">Caspian</a>) boosts Foxing's fragility<span>—</span><i>Dealer</i> is constructed like an expensive timepiece where you can see every exacting movement behind a thick, glossy lacquer. Murphy's much-improved vocals negotiate the curvature of ""Weave""'s mournful melody and the band's syncopated sway<span>—</span>imagine what the Chicago late-'90s post-rock scene could've accomplished if they hooked up with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/450-braid/"">guys downstate</a> in Urbana-Champaign. While there were short instrumental interludes on <i>The Albatross</i>, ""Winding Cloth"" is a full-on string orchestration, offering four minutes to absorb the shellshocked war reportage of ""Indica"" before segueing into the heavy-hearted poetry of ""Redwoods"".</p>
<p>Foxing are willing to delay gratification or even deny it entirely if the song requires it, and on <i>Dealer,</i> it often does. When Murphy and bassist/co-songwriter Josh Coll take on universal topics like sex, religion and war, they're framed through discomforting personal experiences: ""The Magdalene"" is the most dour song about losing one's virginity since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3YVKTxTOgU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sic Transit Gloria…Glory Fades""</a>, drawing on strict Catholic upbringings that instilled what <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2015/08/27/434857775/vikings-choice-foxing-the-magdelene"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coll described</a> as ""the <span>internal fear that spirits are in the room witnessing 'sin' in action""</span>: ""Mother of God on the rosary/ Is she here with us?/ Does she want what she sees?"" The guilt carries on to the present day as Murphy becomes choked by the supposedly no-strings hook-ups in ""Night Channels"" and ""Glass Coughs"". Both build up from spare, plaintive introductions to restrained screams and contained, brassy cacophony<span>—</span>Murphy allows you to feel every pang and writhe of guilt, but catharsis is scant.</p>
<p>There's none whatsoever on ""Indica"", which recounts <a href=""http://collecovision.tumblr.com/post/132000726229/could-you-please-explain-the-meaningstory-behind"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coll's time as a soldier in Afghanistan</a>. Few, if any, indie rock bands have access to this kind of firsthand experience, but that alone isn't enough to ensure it avoids <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAE6Il6OTcs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rooster""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RThMFYBtZLw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Support our Troops OH!""</a> overstatement on either end. Aside from a brief clatter of field snares, there's little but a single, clean guitar and Murphy's voice catatonic from both PTSD and self-medication: ""Could I give back the sounds of their children's screams?/ Let go of what I've seen?"" <i>Dealer</i> isn't a narrative, but both his civilian and Coll's soldier could share the exhaustion of closer ""Three on a Match""—""For what we did, my love, I'm sorry...the Lord won't let me in/ I'm survived by the weight of my own sins."" The devil and God aren't raging inside of Murphy and Coll anymore—<i>Dealer </i>is the arduous post-war reconstruction.</p></div>"|21191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21191-dealer/|7.6|Ian Cohen

The set exists in several editions (2xCD highlights, ultra-limited 18xCD complete, and this set, the deluxe 6xCD edition) and could conceivably be mined to assemble two or three alternate versions of each of those three albums.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Pick a random deep cut like <i>Highway 61</i>'s ""It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry"", and it appears here in four versions, three of them complete. The five versions of <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>'s ""Visions of Johanna"" total 33 minutes. No fewer than 20 of the tracks are given over to ""Like a Rolling Stone"", including the various rehearsals, alternate versions, false starts, and tracks highlighting the stems containing individual instruments from the master take. So <i>The Cutting Edg</i>e is the last word on obsessive studio documentation designed for rabid superfans. But it also happens to contain an almost unbelievable amount of great music that, broken into more digestible portions, any Bob Dylan fan can appreciate.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">During the period covered by this compilation—the transitional, acoustic-leaning folk-rock of <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>, the gnarled blues-rock of <i>Highway 61</i>, and the Americana fusion of <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, enabled by producer Bob Johnston and his Nashville session pros—Dylan recorded in a way that has become rare in the era of unlimited tracks and non-destructive editing: He got a band of musicians in a room and recorded live. In a 1985 interview with Bill Flanagan (who also happens to contribute an essay to this set), Dylan claimed, ""I don't think I knew you could do an overdub until 1978.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That approach partially explains why this massive trove exists in the first place. With the recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Led Zeppelin reissue sets</a>, we were left mostly with early and alternate mixes as bonuses because the masters were carefully constructed in the studio from fragments. With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s ongoing archival series, he's been liberal about recording new instruments and even vocals in the present day to fill in blanks. But Dylan's alternate versions could more accurately be called alternate performances, meaning each one is unique. And given the way he refined and re-worked songs during this period—trying them with just voice and acoustic, adding a full band, changing tempos, time signatures, and lyrics—the different versions can be sharply different in mood and effect.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""She's Your Lover Now"", a song recorded during the <i>Blonde on Blonde</i> sessions but not included on that album, is a good case study in what makes this set fascinating. It wasn't included because Dylan was never able to record it properly—it's a complicated song, with some unusual changes and held notes, and he and his band were never able to get through it without mistakes. Eventually Dylan grew frustrated and moved on. But it's easily one of the best songs Dylan had written to that point, meaning it's one of the best songs he's ever written period, an alternately hilarious and pained story of a guy, his ex-girlfriend, and her new boyfriend encountering each other at a party. The title refrain basically amounts to Dylan saying ""You deal with it—she's your problem now,"" and his disdain for the new guy reinforces how much it still hurts, and how he thinks this dude isn't anywhere nearly enough for her (""And you—just what do you do anyway?""). Songs this rich were coming fast and hard for Dylan during this period, and ""She's Your Lover Now"" is so powerful it's almost a shock to the system when it breaks down after six minutes, a bum note and everyone stops playing, and you are reminded that they were living inside this song and the famously oblique ""wild mercury sound"" Dylan hoped to conjure at the exact same moment.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One of the main points of Greil Marcus' <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Like-Rolling-Stone-Dylan-Crossroads/dp/158648382X"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">book</a> on ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is that the song could have been many things, but what it was owed a lot to chance. Dylan recorded it many times but one take turned out to be <i>the</i> take, and the slight variations in phrasing altered how it was heard forevermore. That quality, of all the possible worlds these new versions suggest, animates the set. What if ""Like a Rolling Stone"" had been a slow waltz? What if ""Leopard-Skin-Pillbox-Hat"" was filled with goofy sound effects? What if ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" had been released in its full band version? (The recording of the latter ends hilariously when Dylan cuts it short and says ""The drumming is driving me mad! I'm going out of my brain."") Some of the differences were subtle and some weren't, but the way this music has been pored over in the years since, none are insignificant.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These two years are Dylan at his wildest. He revolutionized popular music lyrics during this period, bringing in surrealism and romanticism as channeled by the Beats and making it work in a pop context. One of the things he inherited from the Beats was a belief in spontaneous writing and trying to take lyrics more as dictation. Which is not to say he didn't revise—he did, and often. But it's always been a mistake to put too much emphasis on the details of these words and what they might ""mean."" Sometimes they were selected because a turn of phrase was funny, or because Dylan couldn't think of a better rhyme, or sometimes simply because that's what came out. Later on in his writing, he'd have discipline, but this is what he sounded like when he was free.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The structures of these lyrics probably owe something to Dylan's rumored drug experimentation during this period, specifically with marijuana and amphetimines. People on speed use a lot of words and cram them into spaces too small to contain them; they follow digressions and join phrases and ideas that needn't necessarily be joined; the desire to make illogical connections leads, on the one hand, to paranoia—you start to see things that aren't there. But if these tendencies can be channeled just so, they can lead to new structures. ""The sun's not yellow, it's chicken"" goes one of my favorite lines in ""Tombstone Blues"" (heard here in a complete alternate take and another partial version). Nouns and adjectives get chopped up and mixed together, the collisions of language leading to Gertrude Stein-like moments where you can feel your brain being rewired.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All of which is to say that the idea of ""Dylanology"" in the classic sense of decoding these lyrics to undercover what they might ""mean""—Who is Mr. Jones? Where is ""Desolation Row"", what the hell are those jewels and binoculars doing hanging from the head of the mule???—is missing the important point: During this period, language itself was a playground for Dylan. <i>The Cutting Edge</i> is music of the present, but not the '60s present, an eternal present; the songs are about observation and they exist in a place where it's always now, in sound and word.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-ef99d6f2-d3f8-628d-ba1d-12ee42697847"">The music here conjures a feeling of acceleration that couldn't continue—Dylan's songs couldn't get any knottier or more surreal. The album after this one, <i>John Wesley Harding</i>, released in 1968 after Dylan's mysterious motorcycle accident (<i>The Basement Tapes</i> were recorded in between, but not released until 1975), found him heading in the complete opposite direction, stripping everything to the bone and writing with shocking economy and clarity. If everything up until this point had a certain logic to it, the hotshot young folk singer who is growing immensely with each year turns to rock'n'roll, after 1967 Dylan would be impossible to get a handle on. He had many brilliant records ahead of him, but he started to understand the precise value of theater and artifice. Here he was too wild and moving too fast to even figure out how that might work; he was a trickster, as witnessed in his infamous press conferences, but nothing was channeled into a specific direction: It was all blasting outward, in every direction, all at once.</span></p></div>"|21178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21178-the-cutting-edge-1965-1966-the-bootleg-series-volume-12/|8.7|Mark Richardson

All of them speak of being fucked up, being a fuck-up, or some combination of both. In seven of those songs, James Alex sings the word ""alive,"" in three others, he sings ""young,"" and there's one song called ""Young and Alive"". Eight mention some kind of amplification—either turning yourself or the radio up. Oh, and the title is <i>The Things We Do to Find People Who Feel Like Us</i>, which sums it all up: some people get drunk and unite with other weirdos to listen to rock music as loud as possible because for them there's no better way to feel young and alive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s the most passionate batch of love songs you’re liable to hear in 2015, and they’re all about a specifically anthemic form of punk rock. No band shows more belief in it as an agent of social change, but Beach Slang's is the apolitical kind where the right song can unshackle you from self-doubt and pity to get you out of the house and be a part of the world—go meet somebody, go to show that makes you forget about all of your very real problems. Its societal dynamics and terminology are anachronistic and a cynic could view them as willfully naive—the punks and cops are at odds throughout, but it’s mostly over noise ordinance and open container complaints.</p>
<p>For a record bursting with love for its audience, <i>The Things We Do to Find People Who Feel Like Us</i> is divisive by design. If you expect or demand rock bands to create some kind of distance from their work<span>—</span>via irony, cleverness, a desire to look cool<span>—</span>you are one of <i>them</i> and you won’t make it to the first time Alex commands you to pump up the volume on ""Throwaways"". But if you’ve been impatiently waiting for someone to break through the year of self-conscious indie rock, ""I Break Guitars"" and ""Ride the Wild Haze"" make you feel like you're part of Alex's ""<i>us.</i>""<i> </i>The album actually delivers on the title's promise and there’s really no other band trying to fill this crucial role right now, at least until <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"">Japandroids</a> break their silence.</p>
<p>James Alex is 40, significantly older than the other three members of Beach Slang and about 15 years removed from his previous band’s disintegration. He doesn’t hide this fact, and it serves as the basis for <i>The Things We Do</i>’s centerpiece and outlier. ""Too young to die, too late to die young,"" Alex sighs with superhuman earnestness over capoed acoustic guitar (and, since this is the ballad, cue the strings and pianos). It’s a lament from a guy who didn’t live fast or gloriously burn out when he had the chance, and feels like the proverbial old guy at the club even when he’s not at the club. Shoutalong, agenda-free punk rock is aggressively pushed to the margins on all levels in 2015, written off as the kind of music people are expected to outgrow. But what if <i>this</i> is the thing that still does it for you?</p>
<p>Well, then you’re one of Alex's <i>us</i> and your options are to either hide in your records and disengage from the stream of life or celebrate this music that saved your life by adding to it or honoring its intent. Originally appearing as a raw solo cut on a <a href=""https://lame-orecords.bandcamp.com/album/strength-in-weakness"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Philly-based benefit compilation</a>, ""Too Late to Die Young"" was written after Beach Slang’s completely unexpected success and, as usual, there’s an utter lack of artifice and a confrontational vulnerability as Alex looks at the gathering crowd and realizes, ""I swear right now, I’m alright."" Thirty seconds earlier, he admits having been ready to give up and not 30 seconds later, he’s shouting, ""The basement is alive and loud/ We’re alright now"" on a song called ""I Break Guitars"". This is Alex and Beach Slang’s triumph, but he makes sure it’s big enough for all of us to share.</p></div>"|21053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21053-the-things-we-do-to-find-people-who-feel-like-us/|8.0|Ian Cohen

Even when she was making low-key electro-pop, Goulding’s music has always played heavily with a high drama beyond reality. She’s good at selling stories, constructing big ""us against the world"" tracks for fans who want songs that play like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjMMGxgEisk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fairy tales</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFatODUR1CE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">battle cries</a> like some dancefloor-ready <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"">Natasha Khan</a>.</p>
<p>But after flirting with indie dance, then Calvin Harris and Starsmith-produced EDM, Goulding is adding some Swedes to her arsenal for <i>Delirium</i>: Max Martin, Carl Falk, and Peter Svensson, to be specific. And Goulding, who went from being famous only in the UK to performing at the White House, very much deserves at this point in her career to have a third record fit with all the big pop trimmings.</p>
<p>While <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17171-halcyon/"">Halcyon</a> </i>was a dark collection that flitted between club-ready synth-pop and soulful, orchestral ballads, <i>Delirium</i> dives head first into the former with confidence. At times, the record exists in the same '80s-pop wannabe universe as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen/"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/""><i>E•MO•TION</i></a> or Taylor Swift’s <i>1989, </i>with gushing vocals and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Moroder</a>-kissed synths on tracks like ""Codes"" and her <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> song ""Love Me Like You Do"". Elsewhere, she inches back to her dance music roots on the sultry house-leaning ""Don’t Need Nobody"" and the marriage of a scratchy acoustic loop with techno on ""Devotion"".</p>
<p>But while the best tracks here are the ones that transcend and build on pop trends, a few others merely copy them. ""Keep on Dancin’"" is a more minimalist sibling to Adam Lambert’s Martin-produced hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix8ocFEMa1o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ghost Town""</a> and while ""Something in the Way You Move"" might be a mighty fine song in a vacuum, Selena Gomez has already done it with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XFfWems2_A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Me &amp; the Rhythm""</a>. The bubbly, ""I’m sticking to you like glue"" doo-wop of ""Around U"" feels particularly out of place among <i>Delirium</i>’s darker, deeper tones, playing like a better fit for Meghan Trainor than Goulding. Still, even when the songs here evoke other hits, they’re still bangers in their own right.</p>
<p>And Goulding’s signature vibrato and energy make even the more trend-chasing songs on the album fully hers. Her voice is fullest in the jangly ballad ""Lost and Found"", where she keeps her straightforward vocals at the forefront. ""We got other things we can do with our,"" she sings flirtatiously in the verses of ""Codes"", stopping for a beat, before drawing out ""tiiime"" into a high-pitched lilt, but she moves into a punchy, shouting sing-song for the chorus.</p>
<p>Aside from a little well-done sass (""You were talking deep, like it was mad love to you/ You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos"") on the album’s single ""On My Mind"", there’s an adult sophistication to <i>Delirium</i>. Nobody’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shaking off</a> haters, bemoaning that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h30Bx4Klxg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">same old love</a>, or asking that you <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il9nqWw9W3Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">don’t tell your mother</a> that you, uh, made out with someone? Granted, <i>Delirium</i> is fun, but the mood is upfront, Goulding’s romantic propositions more realistic demands than adolescent, yearning questions. A track like ""Codes"" might be dressed up in sexy language but the sentiment is clear: can we please put a label on this? ""When love’s not playing out like the movies/ It doesn’t mean it’s falling apart/ Don’t panic,"" she assures on the stand-out ""Don’t Panic"", whose musical-box quality makes it sound like a polished <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13995-lights/""><i>Lights</i></a>-era throwback. <i>Delirium</i> manages to be a cool, dramatic pop album that rarely hyperbolizes what love is all about. And might I remind you that this is the person who wrote <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGyEd0aKWZE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Burn""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Delirium</i> grounds Ellie Goulding’s penchant for spectacle in tightly-written pop songs. Her evocative storytelling and ability to craft great dance music is all here, but repackaged as something more emotionally tangible, ditching feel-good EDM lyrical logic for realness. And while these songs can sometimes evoke other major players in her genre, she makes Max Martin’s signatures feel personal, making a mature pop record that feels like a natural progression.</p></div>"|21180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21180-delirium/|7.2|Hazel Cills

Her overture is punctuated by an emphatic drumbeat and ominous piano chords, then an electric guitar crashes down around her. Yet, she remains unfazed by the commotion, as she half-whispers lyrics about losing herself in lovelorn madness (""locura desmedida"") and succumbing to a yearning that hurt worse (""más dolor"") than physical wounds. Morrison’s voice wavers and twirls, suggesting a less forceful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine"">Florence Welch</a> or a more grounded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine"">Jeff Buckley</a>. This is pop music with a healthy sense of grandeur.</p>
<p>The song itself is one long, careful, patient crescendo, and by the halfway point, it seems to have reached its climax. But then something unexpected happens: Rather than let the momentum subside, Morrison and her band coast on that cresting wave for several more minutes, maintaining that tension without sacrificing any nuance in her vocals or resorting to ostentatious melodrama. It’s a big moment on an album full of big moments—on an album that is, in fact, all about big moments. These wounded love songs evoke great wellings of despair and desire, amplifying and ennobling those emotions in a way that ought to be comprehensible and relatable even to those listeners who don’t speak Spanish.</p>
<p>A native of the Baja California region of Mexico, Morrison has been a central figure in the extremely tight-knit and defiantly independent Mexican pop community for just six years, releasing a steady stream of EPs and LPs and winning two Latin Grammys for her 2012 album <a href=""https://polenrecords.bandcamp.com/album/dejenme-llorar"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Déjenme Llorar</i></a>. Although she has recorded with a range of Mexican artists—including the singer-songwriter Natalia LaFourcade, the Monterrey band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2364-kinky/"">Kinky</a>, and Tijuana producer Alejandro Jiménez, better known as Jandro—Morrison may be best known to American listeners from her cameo on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/650-calexico/"">Calexico</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20353-edge-of-the-sun/"">Edge of the Sun</a> </i>earlier this year or from the 2012 documentary <i>Hecho en México</i>, about the Mexican indie scene. Both showcased her distinctive vocals, but neither suggested Morrison was capable of something as impressive as <i>Amor Supremo</i>.</p>
<p>In fact, nothing in her catalog sounds anything like this album. Her previous work has generally adhered to acoustic instruments and mixed new rock and pop sounds with older Mexican bolero and ballad traditions. With each subsequent release, however, Morrison has grown bolder and more adventurous, and the title of her 2013 EP—<i>Jugando en Serio</i>—sums up her approach perfectly. That sense of playing seriously culminates on <i>Amor Supremo</i>. As she explained to <i><a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/6708166/carla-morrison-discusses-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billboard</a></i> in September, she recorded the album over eight months in a house near the beach in Playas de Tijuana, ""where we could hear the ocean all day."" There she worked with producers Jandro and Demian Jiménez as well as a rotating group of musicians to find a new sound—one rooted in Mexico but embracing international trends and ideas.</p>
<p>First single ""Un Beso"", released in September, heralded a dramatic change and introduced the elements that color <i>Amor Supremo</i>: the disembodied drums, the shimmery synths, the cathedral organ, and the stabs of Lynchian guitar. What’s remarkable is how much mileage she gets from these few instruments. They provide the foundation for every song, but there’s always a twist, always some new combination that prevents the music from becoming repetitive or tired: the Middle Eastern strings on ""Cercanía"", the prismatic synth theme on ""Mi Secreto"", the weightless rhythms of ""Tú Atacas"", even the crackle of guitar on ""Azúcar Morena"", which sounds like a fuse being lit. Even when the production becomes gauzy and blurred around the edges, it’s usually to emphasize the emotional specificity of her vocals, which are forceful but not overpowering, wounded yet strong, pleading but never whiny. Even the way she sings a simple word like ""tí"" can stop you short.</p>
<p>Morrison commands these songs, cuts across the language barrier, makes you understand something beyond the words. And the words are important here. In shedding her old musical palette, she embraces trends and traditions that sound more international in scope, and these songs draw from a range of influences, including American soul and European pop. And yet, she continues to sing exclusively in Spanish, even when an English-language album might have more commercial potential. It’s a crucial decision, one that implies there are certain emotions and ideas—certain big moments—that are specific to Mexico and expressible only in her native language, whether it’s the particular sugar she tastes on her lover’s skin (""Azúcar Morena es tu piel"") or a personal struggle she knows she must overcome (""Esta lucha es solo contra mi""). All moments are big moments, and that epiphany makes <i>Amor Supremo</i> one of the most rewarding and genuinely moving pop albums of 2015.</p></div>"|21243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21243-amor-supremo/|8.0|Stephen M.

Much of the album was written in isolation—<a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/stream-julien-bakers-debut-sprained-ankle.html#"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">after Baker left Memphis</a> for Middle Tennessee State University, she worked on these songs in a soundproof booth within the campus music building. It was recorded in Richmond's Spacebomb Studios, a destination <i>du jour</i> that birthed lusciously orchestrated countrypolitan records from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30501-matthew-e-white/"">Matthew E. White</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32614-natalie-prass/"">Natalie Prass</a> this year, but these one-mic and one-take songs could have easily been tracked in an MTSU bathroom. Listening to it can occasionally feel like a violation of her privacy.</p>
<p>This voyeuristic appeal plays a minor role in distinguishing <i>Sprained Ankle</i>, though. More important is how Baker operates in existential ultimatums<span>—</span>life or death, hope or despair, oblivion or epiphany. It cuts through the bullshit rather than piling onto it, and its clarity and honesty has instantly helped Baker reach across aisles. She recently opened for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31567-touche-amore"">Touché Amoré</a>, a post-hardcore band of blazing intensity and extreme devotees that was previously on <a href=""http://6131records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">6131 Records</a> and more indicative of the music on Baker's label. By the end of November, she'll be joining the tasteful-indie double bill of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33109-el-vy"">EL VY</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5739-wye-oak"">Wye Oak</a>.</p>
<p><i>Sprained Ankle</i> is a solo, singer-songwriter album, but very little of it would be considered ""folky."" She professes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4833-david-bazan"">David Bazan</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32990-mewithoutyou"">mewithoutYou</a>'s Aaron Weiss, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6101-ben-gibbard"">Ben Gibbard</a> as idols, but her guitar playing bears more of their influence than their vocals. She's a minimalist, playing bassy clusters of melodic thirds, flicking silvery harmonics, palm-muting chords. It's gorgeously recorded and yet, there's still the suggestion that these might've been demos<span>—</span>the scant overdubs of drums or harmonized vocals just drive home how lonely Baker is, that she may have meant these to eventually be full-band arrangements one day.</p>
<p>There are traces of other current acts in her sound—the album title is inspired by a lyric (""Sprinter learning to wait/ Marathon runner, my ankles are sprained"") that instantly brings up the similarly ecclesiastical bloodletting of fellow Tennessean <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20290-sprinter"">Torres</a>, while her thick, close-harmonizing recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten"">Sharon Van Etten</a>.  But considering her formative listening experiences and punk roots, by the time she reaches the high notes over an aggressively strummed, stock descending chord pattern in ""Everybody Does"", her most apt comparison might be<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1011-dashboard-confessional""> Dashboard Confessional</a>. Before Chris Carrabba became a caricature of himself and an avatar for emo-as-a-Halloween-costume, there really wasn't much else like him for the hardcore kids. Baker has the same kind of magnetism to get lines like, ""I am so good at hurting myself"", sung by a crowd of young acolytes. Baker's metaphors can also be similarly excessive and clunky at times (""I know I am a pile of filthy wreckage you will wish you never touched"").</p>
<p>Obviously, these songs are about resilience, but Baker acknowledges her willingness to wallow in despair. ""Good News"" plays on the double meaning of hysterical: ""It's not easy when what you think of me is so important/ And I know it shouldn't be so important...I'm only screaming at myself in public/ I know I shouldn't act this way in public."" Later, she asks to be swallowed and smothered by the parking lot as you drive away, an echo of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a>'s operatic curtain call during the 190-proof melodrama of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAJ_74tDZzU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Know It's Over""</a>.</p>
<p>And like Moz, Baker isn't without a sense of humor about herself. ""Wish I could write songs about anything other than death"" isn't the sort of thing you say unless you're self-aware. But it<b> </b>is important for people to see someone struggle through some serious shit to get to that point, and if you prefer redemption songs to sound as raw as they feel, <i>Sprained Ankle </i>could bring you to your knees.</p></div>"|21260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21260-sprained-ankle/|7.0|Ian Cohen

Originally released in 1970, the Velvet Underground’s fourth album marked the moment where Lou Reed’s early gig as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed#1964.E2.80.9370:_Pickwick_Records_and_the_Velvet_Underground"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Pickwick Records song doctor</a> ceased to be an amusing footnote to the band’s story and became their governing principle. <i>Loaded</i> is the sort of proper album that feels like a greatest hits collection, with each track thoroughly inhabiting and mastering a dominant rock archetype: the hippy-dippy, harmony-rich singalong; the sneering, street walkin’ prowler; the cheeky honky-tonk throwback; the wedding slow-dance standard; the dirty blues grind; the lighter-waving, anthemic grand finale. <i>Loaded</i> remains the one Velvets album you can put on at a house party among mixed company without killing the vibe or sending people running for the door, and it contains the only song in their repertoire—""Sweet Jane""—that you have any hope of hearing on an oldies station today.</p>
<p>But being a perfect rock'n'roll album is a very different thing than being a perfect Velvet Underground album. Part of what makes the Velvet Underground’s official discography so unique is that each of the four dramatically different albums they released between 1967 and 1970 could be considered their definitive statement, and yet each could also be considered the outlier. However, in the latter sense, that distance is amplified with <i>Loaded</i>, and not just because Moe Tucker—the pounding heartbeat of the band—sat out the sessions to tend to her pregnancy, necessitating a drumming-by-committee approach. When stacked against the dark, droning psychedelia of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17129-the-velvet-underground-nico/""><i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i></a>, the flesh-melting distortion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18770-the-velvet-underground-white-lightwhite-heat/""><i>White Light/White Heat</i></a>, and the disarming quietude of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20015-the-velvet-underground-the-velvet-underground/""><i>The Velvet Underground</i></a>, there’s nothing overtly contrarian about <i>Loaded</i>. It’s the album that plays least into the myth of the Velvets as transgressive avant-rock outsiders and speaks most loudly to their reality, as a working band playing half-empty bars, desperate to deliver a hit to their antsy major label minders.</p>
<p>That pressure was baked into the very title of the record, a directive from their Atlantic Records bosses to produce a record ""loaded"" with potential hit singles—and the band delivered on every count, except, of course, the sales part. In that respect, <i>Loaded</i> stands as one of rock’s first truly meta artifacts, prefiguring such label-baiting in-jokes as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>’s <i>Everybody’s Rockin’</i> rebuke to Geffen Records and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bJ_Ytn8Krs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter""</a>. This is, after all, a rock 'n'roll album that advertises its populist intent with a song about rock'n'roll called ""Rock &amp; Roll"". Past provocations gave way to carefree kicks: ""Head Held High"" is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqQszHAXx5s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I’m Waiting for the Man""</a> fresh out of rehab; ""Train Round the Bend"" is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53F5nY68cBM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sister Ray""</a> sent to the confession booth. But while <i>Loaded</i> may constitute a concerted effort to play by the rules, the Velvets come off like boarding school-bound delinquents who spend their class time stifling giggles and sneaking snarky notes. Whether answering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>’ optimistic ""Here Comes the Sun"" with the withering ""Who Loves the Sun?"" or crashing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">the Byrds</a>’ country-rock rodeo on ""Lonesome Cowboy Bill"", <i>Loaded</i> feels as much like a sardonic comment on pop’s ruling class as a bid to join its rarefied ranks. Atop the immortal riff of ""Sweet Jane"", Reed declares, ""me, I’m in a rock'n'roll band,"" before adding a ""<i>huh</i>""—and, after a million listens, it’s still hard to tell if it’s being delivered with a smirk or a shrug.</p>
<p>Alas, all that contradictory tension proved emblematic of deeper fissures running through the band. As this six-disc box set expansion of <i>Loaded</i> makes clear, the Velvets’ most airtight album ironically bears telling signs of their unravelling. Compiling remastered stereo and mono versions of the album, demos, alternate mixes, outtakes, a surround-sound DVD album mix, and two live sets, <i>Loaded: Re-Loaded</i> <i>45th Anniversary Edition</i> highlights the painstaking tweaks and tinkering that went into making a seemingly effortless rock'n'roll album. Like the previous box sets in the Velvets’ current reissue campaign, <i>Re-Loaded</i> is less about unearthing rare tracks (much of the bonus material here first surfaced on 1997’s <i>Fully Loaded</i>) than getting the story straight, and properly contextualizing the output of a band whose official albums have been overwhelmed by a continuous stream of posthumous live albums, rarities compilations, and bootlegs. In the case of <i>Loaded</i>, the stereo and mono mixes don’t exist merely to satisfy differing listener preferences, but to present conflicting visions for the album. The former contains the extended versions of ""Sweet Jane"" and ""New Age"" that were eventually pared down for the official November 1970 release, much to Reed’s chagrin; he had left the band shortly after recording was completed, effectively sealing the album’s doomed fate before it even hit stores.</p>
<p>Tellingly, on <i>Loaded</i>, Reed already sounds like he’s handing the keys to the band over to bassist Doug Yule, who sings lead on four of the album’s 10 songs and plays much of the instrumentation. In contrast to John Cale, the band co-founder he replaced in 1968, Yule was never so much Reed’s foil as his eager understudy, with a more naturally melodic voice that buffed away Reed’s rough edges. But that’s no slight: Yule’s smooth-talker act yields the album’s most subversive moments, whether selling the bitter cynicism of ""Who Loves the Sun?"" as shiny, happy, ba-ba-da-ba pop, or playing the hotel bar-prowling hustler on ""New Age"" who sycophantically woos a faded movie star for a one-night stand only to cruelly discard her as ""over the hill."" And as the outtakes disc reveals, ""I Found a Reason"" could’ve easily wound up as a straight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Dylan</a> rip, before Yule’s angelic harmonies helped transform it into the most gorgeously celestial ballad in the Velvets’ canon. (Partially due to outstanding contractual commitments, Yule would soldier forth under the Velvet Underground name without any other original members for 1973’s largely forgotten <i>Squeeze</i>, an album unlikely to enjoy its own 45th-anniversary box set moment.)</p>
<p>More than just a collection of song scraps, <i>Re-Loaded</i>’s demo stash lets us imagine how <i>Loaded</i> might’ve turned out without the hitmaking ambitions, from the rough-hewn takes of future Reed solo standards like ""Satellite of Love"" to the organ-swirled fantasia of ""Ocean"" (the most prog the Velvets ever got) to a molasses-slow version of ""Sweet Jane"" that anticipates <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4XVJj4jER4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Cowboy Junkies’ codeined cover</a>. Meanwhile, the first live disc—a remaster of <i>Live at Max’s Kansas City</i>—offers a glimpse of the arena-ready powerhouse the Velvets had become just prior to Reed’s exit. (The two sets that make up the show—one devoted to rockers, the other to ballads—were recorded by Factory regular Brigid Polk on August 23 1970, reportedly Reed’s last night fronting the band; the version included here omits two tracks from the 2004 double-disc reissue of the complete concert, presumably to make it fit on a single disc.) If <i>Loaded</i> is the closest the Velvets ever got to becoming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">the Rolling Stones</a>, on <i>Max’s Kansas City</i> they practically turn into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">the Who</a>, as Doug’s brother Billy propels ""I’m Waiting for the Man"" and ""Beginning to See the Light"" with thundering Moon-shot drum rolls. But the recording is ultimately a faded snapshot of a live act in peak form at a career nadir: from the infamous intrusion of Jim Carroll trying to score some Tuinal to the idle audience chit-chat about the movie <i>Patton</i> that overwhelms ""Candy Says"", the Velvets are rendered as mere background noise even for the few devotees who bothered to come out to their shows.</p>
<p>The second concert included here—and of most interest to Velvets completists—predates the <i>Max’s Kansas City</i> show by a few months, but exudes an even greater degree of finality. Recorded by a fan on a reel-to-reel, the May 1970 set at Philadelphia’s Second Fret club sees Reed, Yule, and guitarist Sterling Morrison performing without a drummer (though Yule would hit the skins on a couple of songs). The stripped-down, slackened presentation greatly distinguishes it from other live Velvets documents of the era, while emphasizing certain subliminal textures, like the krautrock pulse running through ""Cool It Down"", or the tremolo wash on ""Train Round the Bend"" that essentially invents <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a> a good 12 years early. (There’s also a rare Reed-sung version of ""New Age"" with considerably different lyrics.) These curios aside, <i>Live at Second Fret</i> is the sort of moldy bootleg you probably only need to hear once, that is, if you can even make it all the way through—the recording has the fidelity of a pocket-dial. But the decaying, desolate presentation feels like an appropriate way to capture a band on the verge of disintegration. The set ends, as <i>Loaded</i> does, with ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin’"", and the two versions crystallize the album’s story in miniature: one is the grandiose statement of a band with chart-topping aspirations, the other is the lonesome sound of a band that ain’t got nothin’ at all.</p></div>"|21220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21220-loaded-re-loaded-45th-anniversary-edition/|10.0|Stuart Berman

As he explained it, he would throw parties at his parents' house in Laguna Beach, and their small circle of musician friends would write songs and start bands specifically for the events. Different combinations of the same people were getting together and exploring different vibes. ""You guys still do that,"" Maron observed. And he's right. This year alone, Segall has been juggling several projects. His circle of friends and collaborators (Moothart, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32291-meatbodies/"">Meatbodies</a>' Chad Ubovich, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27851-wand/"">Wand</a>'s Cory Hanson, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>' John Dwyer, and Cronin) all tend to have multiple irons in the fire.</p>
<p>Those high school bands weren't focused on long-term sustainability; they were momentary sparks of creative energy. To this day, the best moment in the life of any new Segall project is the first spark. The introductory taste of new music from these bands offers the opportunity to parse how aesthetic and personnel differences define the music—to hear what separates it from prior work, what makes it exciting, and what the chances are that the project will outlive the confines of a 7"". Segall and Moothart's band Fuzz made a strong first impression with their debut 2012 single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5aypdnzY7w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fuzz's Fourth Dream""</a>. It was a showcase for Moothart's guitar solo mastery, the band's stellar hook work, the effortless way they can slink into a groove, and Segall's ace drumming. With 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18570-fuzz-fuzz/""><i>Fuzz</i></a>, the proto-metal-worshipping power trio became a proven entity—a well-oiled machine with a few strong songs. The lineup now features Ubovich, and if you only take into account his impressive work as Meatbodies' frontman, it seems Fuzz have only become more powerful.</p>
<p>Fuzz's second full-length, <i>II</i>, is a double album—a ballsy and potentially dangerous move for a band who operate best when their songs are kept tight. Their <i>Fuzz </i>track ""Loose Sutures"", for example, went a bit too loose and lost its momentum about halfway in. More than half of <i>II</i>'s songs are over four minutes long, and the longest one of the bunch is the most disappointing of them all. The final 14-minute track, ""II"", is an obligatory instrumental sequel to <i>Fuzz</i>'s instrumental closer ""One"". Where ""One"" ramps up the power and velocity of its central hook, ""II"" never quite figures out exactly where it's going. It changes course several times, and along the way, a question emerges—how much Fuzz is too much?</p>
<p>It's a bum note to end on, but before they reach that final song, Fuzz knock out some undeniable high points in their discography. Ubovich's bass provides the perfect dour counterbalance to Segall's dulcet vocal on ""Let It Live"". There's a premium on heaviness, and ""Pollinate"" certainly delivers the thudding, crashing goods. And if <i>Fuzz</i> occasionally felt too spare, <i>II </i>is where they throw everything at the wall. All three men play synthesizers, and in a few well-placed moments, they've got string arrangements courtesy of <a href=""http://www.laenageronimo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laena Geronimo</a>. They often change pace—tempo, emphasis, texture—at the moment a song begins to feel stale.</p>
<p>It also helps that they're the rare band where any of the three members could serve as the frontman. While Segall's voice is undeniably the most impressive, Moothart and Ubovich come across more gritty and grounded—perfect for songs about ""teeth twisting in the heatwave."" It's also refreshing to hear Fuzz bucking their former formula—their ""lead singers take turns"" approach goes out the window on ""Burning Wreath"", which features Segall and Moothart trading lines and briefly harmonizing. It's a small moment, but one that hints at how much this band are capable of when you consider how much talent they have between them.</p>
<p><span>That's why it's disappointing when, around the album's third side, Fuzz's songs begin to feel anonymous—like they're retreading ground they'd already covered earlier in the album. Segall, Moothart, and Ubovich have done an impressive job of nailing this sound, and </span><span>somewhere in the stoner rock sprawl, they have enough impressive moments and great songs for a truly strong album that's about half as long. </span><span>They just don't do quite enough to differentiate their approach or justify the album's 67-minute run-time. There are definitely instances of them changing things up—""Red Flag"" is a two-minute punk song on an album that benefits from brief interstitials. Even considering all the high points and raw power, </span><i>II</i><span> </span><span>falters under the weight of the band's ambition.</span></p></div>"|21124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21124-ii/|6.7|Evan Minsker

That outfit’s records are driven by improvisation, though not necessarily in the form of individual solos. Instead, Abrams and his collaborators create hypnotic interlocking patterns, rhythms, and melodies that seem to spool forth endlessly without any single voice taking center stage. It is serene and peaceful music that relies on spontaneous invention, but also on restraint.</p>
<p>It’s a sensibility that is carried over to Abrams’ other pursuits. In the past several years, the bassist has also established a reputation as a composer for film. Released digitally by <a href=""http://eremite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eremite Records</a>, <i>Music for Life Itself &amp; The Interrupters</i> collects two scores that Abrams composed for documentary filmmaker, Steve James—best known for his 1994 picture, <i>Hoop Dreams</i>—including the two features in the title as well as a two-minute piece written for the short, <i>A Place Called Pluto</i>.</p>
<p>If you’re coming to this music having listened to Abrams’ work in Natural Information Society, one thing will be immediately noticeable: these compositions are a lot shorter. Working in the context of a film, there’s no room to sprawl and most of Abrams’ cues last barely more than a minute. It’s a very different kind of music making, but the results share certain qualities with the composer’s other outlet, mainly in that they often carefully balance ambience and melody.</p>
<p>Released last year, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4SgwBRq-fU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Life Itself</i></a> is an adaptation of film critic Roger Ebert’s memoir of the same name. Though the film includes interview footage shot during the final months of Ebert’s battle with cancer, the mood is not morose. Abrams’ score is mostly lighthearted, often taking stylistic inspiration from blues and '60s cool jazz. Much of it seems to capture spontaneous interplay. The central thread, ""Roger’s Theme"", finds a brass band trading riffs and ""Professional Enemies"" is largely a bass solo. For the film’s somber and reflective moments, Abrams’ arranges music that suggests a sense of peace—drones and light chords embellished with flourishes of trumpet and harp.</p>
<p>This is followed by Abrams’ score for James’ 2011 film, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC1EOm4o_0A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Interrupters</i></a>, which tracks a group of anti-violence activists working with communities in Chicago. Commissioned a mere six weeks before the film's Sundance Film Festival premiere, it's the slightly less polished of the pair. However, with its focus on percussion and hip-hop rhythms, it’s probably the more enjoyable of the two to listen to outside of the context of the film. On both, Abrams’ benefits from the presence of great musicians, including drummer Hamid Drake, saxophonist Ari Brown, and guitarist Jeff Parker, who also performs in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>.</p>
<p>Watching the films, Abrams’ music is never intrusive. It enhances a scene, but never forces a mood. And while it’s probably not the first place you’d turn to experience his work, it provides an example of his stylistic reach and musical ability. Natural Information Society’s music thrives amid the extended zone-out, but listening to the music for <i>The Interrupters</i>, it’s surprising how malleable many of those sounds are—that, in miniature, the music can slot so naturally into somebody else’s story.</p></div>"|21177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21177-music-for-life-itself-the-interrupters/|7.0|Aaron Leitko

The NYC-based duo have collaborated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O’Rourke</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"">Thurston Moore</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16531-william-winant/"">William Winant</a> among others over the years, but <i>Accidental Sky</i> marks their first outing with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/778-nels-cline/"">Nels Cline</a>, the inventive avant-garde guitarist who has been a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> since 2004. The result is the band’s most abbreviated LP-sized outing, clocking in at a 38-minute length so economical that the record seems to conclude almost before it’s even begun.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given <i>Accidental Sky</i>’s pointedly terrestrial vibe, this brevity proves instructive. Surgal, Culbertson, and Cline aren’t hot-wiring and joyriding across the skies in an interstellar jalopy here; they’re locked outside the hangar, desperately MacGyvering some means—any means—of ingress. By his lonesome, in combos, or with Wilco, Cline is an inventive, expressive player, but his communions with White Out tend toward the quarrelous and cerebral.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Sky</i> is at its best when it runs the risk of suffocation. ""Imperative"" opens as a hashed blues, then quickly descends into a dark brew of mini-riffs, topsy-turvy synth jags, and savage little drum rolls. Flutes flutters through ""Under a Void Moon"" besieged by clawed noise, distended guitar, and Dada-esque utterances. <span>At moments, White Out can sound as lost in the weeds as some listeners may </span><span>feel</span><span>: Culbertson’s zig-zagged wails and the pair’s bells, whistles, and effects congeal into an unstable nucleus around which guests revolve, wildly.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What’s most frustrating isn’t ultimately that <i>Sky</i> doesn’t make it beyond the stratosphere, but that some of these songs should go on <i>longer</i>; they need more space to stretch, breathe, expand into stranger, deeper realms. The album winds down with ""Soft Nameless Absolute"", where contemplative Cline chords are buried beneath several strains of jittery, mirroring synthesizers. There’s a generous, sunburst grandiosity to the song, which is so coherent that it seems to have wandered in from an album by a different band. Given the tendency to self-edit and considering how Cline’s guitar elbows gracefully out of the fray and ""Absolute"" drifts to a measured close all suggests that, artistically, White Out may be nearing the end of a well-trod path.</p></div>"|21193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21193-accidental-sky/|6.9|Raymond Cummings

In 2015, a composer isn’t obliged to choose melodic minimalism over atonal complexity, or vice versa. If she wants to write something that ""addresses the times,"" there’s no set aesthetic to follow. Execution is what the community of listeners has (generally) pledged to judge.</p>
<p>You can hear this relatively new, pan-stylistic freedom quite clearly in the music of Ted Hearne. As a political animal, he’s a liberal populist; as a composer, he’s a fan of preexisting texts and musical maximalism. His 2010 protest song-cycle <i>Katrina Ballads</i> set real life excerpts from an American tragedy—think of George W. Bush’s famous assessment <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=95&amp;v=L_8IeYmFbvA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Brownie you’re doing a heck of a job""</span></a>—to a richly textured musical backdrop that blended jazz and classical vocal approaches with aggrieved electric guitar and frenetic chamber scoring. In 2013, Hearne provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"">Erykah Badu</a> with well-judged orchestrations of songs from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11562-new-amerykah-part-one-4th-world-war/""><i>New Amerykah: Part One (4th World War)</i></a>, which Badu <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAjDzWyN2AE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>performed live</span></a> with the Brooklyn Philharmonic. (We’re still waiting for a proper studio recording of those.)</p>
<p>With this album, Hearne gives us a distillation of an experimental stage work about Chelsea Manning (and WikiLeaks) that was <a href=""http://www.bam.org/music/2014/the-source"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>presented in 2014</span></a> at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Composing once again atop found texts—including logs of Manning’s chats and leaked government documents that were selected and edited by the novelist Mark Doten—Hearne’s latest project gives us some of the composer’s most intriguing music yet. </p>
<p>In the song ""s/as boy/as a boy"", Hearne scores one of Manning’s <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2011/07/manning-lamo-logs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>haunting pre-arrest concerns</span></a>—""i wouldn’t mind going to prison for the rest of my life/ if it wasn’t for the possibility of having pictures of me.../ plastered all over the world press.../ as boy""—by way of a somber cello-and-guitar riff that is frequently interrupted by percussive slaps. (The discrete instrumental parts swirl together with an affecting unease, circa Manning’s line, ""I'm just kind of drifting now."")</p>
<p>Another highlight is ""Julian in a Nutshell"", in which Doten creates lyrics from shards of questions delivered to Julian Assange by reporters. At first, Hearne pairs Doten’s documentary cut-up fragments with airy individual string and vocal lines. As the journalistic narrative is better established—demanding that Assange define himself as either a ""journalist"", an ""anarchist"", or the victim of a ""smear campaign""—the vocal lines settle into sunnier harmonies. It’s the sound of the press finding an angle, though Hearne’s subtly clattering orchestration isn’t as sold on the quality of the conversation.</p>
<p>Inevitably, this audio-only version of <i>The Source</i> also omits some key aspects of the ""multimedia oratorio"", occasionally rendering an abstract production even more conceptually opaque. In director Daniel Fish’s <a href=""https://vimeo.com/110715231"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>filmed excerpts</span></a> from the original staging, we can see that <i>The Source</i> originally included a chorus of silent observers that surrounded the audience, on video-projection screens. Looming large over the proceedings, that visual chorus adds a measure of ghostly gravity to the long chunks of leaked military cables that Hearne’s actors recite through vocal filters.</p>
<p>These bureaucratic passages certainly deserve grimly robotic accompaniment. (Think of lyrics like: ""An IED detonation was reported by C co 1-327 INF to Task force SPARTAN, in the Salah Ad Din Province, Ad Dawr, vicinity. 38S LD 8930 1490."") But on the album version, these long stretches of war-euphemism can wear thin. Without the ability to conjure the silent witnesses on a recording, Hearne instead references the wider culture by inserting drops from pop songs. At best, these feel unnecessary. At worst, they’re distracting: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiEwavLjpeo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Girls! Girls! Girls!""</a> isn’t contemporaneous with the WikiLeaks era, nor is its consideration of gender politics particularly relevant to Chelsea Manning’s worries about being misgendered while serving some future prison sentence. This version of <i>The Source</i> could have benefitted from some stronger editing, though when it connects, it can still resonate as some of the most expressive socially engaged music in recent memory—from any genre.</p></div>"|21131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21131-the-source/|7.0|Seth Colter Walls

We might find ourselves ""reincarnated as a SIM card in Singapore, or as a beetle in Scotland,"" as Shepherd <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9719-floating-points-braindance/"">told</a> Pitchfork recently.</p>
<p>He recorded the song ""Elaenia"" the very next morning, and its improvised, fluid form mirrors the dream's holistic vision. Made with just a Fender Rhodes electric piano and a handful of arcane synthesizers, it bobs between gurgles and limpid, lyric melodies. At more than seven minutes long, it is the second-longest song on the album, and also the most spare— just a handful of chords, some rumble, and a lot of nuance. Like an ocean swell, it is simple on the surface but complex beneath, and the same could be said of <i>Elaenia</i> as a whole.</p>
<p>Though comparatively short—just seven songs totaling some 43 minutes—<i>Elaenia</i> is rich and welcoming, balancing Shepherd's intelligence with intuition. Flitting between strange time signatures and simple pulses, it utilizes mostly analog synthesizers, pairing them with live instrumentation: electric bass, guitar, piano, live drums, and strings. It is as warm and fluid an ""electronic"" album as you will hear all year, and it has a timeless feel: There's no reason it could not have been written and recorded 10, 20, or even 30 years ago.</p>
<p>For long-time fans of the UK producer, musician, and DJ, <i>Elaenia </i>feels both like a surprise and a logical extension of his previous singles and EPs. Rhythms are played, not looped or sampled; the album skirts the edges of the dancefloor, flitting between ambient miniatures and extended jams falling somewhere between post-rock and jazz fusion. But nothing here feels like a radical departure, which is a testament to Shepherd's gradual process of refinement. He is trained in neuroscience and epigenetics, but it would be just as easy to imagine him as a furniture builder who had spent the past six years working on a single desk. The underlying structure of his work has remained more or less constant for years, but with every recording, it gets a little smoother, a little more perfect, inching a little closer to its ideal form.</p>
<p>Shepherd has cited Talk Talk as an inspiration, and you can hear the influence of albums like<i> Laughing Stock</i> on the porous fabric of <i>Elaenia</i>. It's a record best heard loud, because the quiet parts can be <i>very</i> quiet, and its spirit lies less in melodies or even moods than in tiny details. With the exception of the cosmic jazz-leaning ""Silhouettes (1,11,111)"", you're left less with hummable themes than with small, passing moments: the burnished gleam of a lone Rhodes key hit hard, a faint scrap of radio static, soft notes that cling to each other like burrs.</p>
<p>In keeping with the transfiguration theme, the music seems to have no stable center at all. It moves like clouds in the sky, slowly and imperceptibly shape-shifting, and at any given moment, what's being played matters less than how we arrived at that point. The sense of an unbroken line is paramount, leading to the album's final thrill when it is suddenly yanked up at a 45-degree angle. In five minutes it goes from silence to jet-engine loud. Synthesizers snarl, the string section goes into overdrive, and the drum kit rolls on inexorably, explosion upon explosion. The song, ""Peroration Six"", is the only one where you feel Shepherd and company really letting loose.  It's a revelation and a rush, a full-on ""Fuck yeah!"" shouted into the coming storm. The last thing we hear sounds almost like a wrong note, and then it's all simply cut short. The silence is deafening; it feels like waking up from a very heavy dream.</p></div>"|21110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21110-floating-points-elaenia/|8.4|Philip Sherburne

Four-fifths of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beyoncé</i></a> had Boots' stamp on it, and since then the artist and producer, whose real name is Jordan Asher, has been busy. He's brought his surly, gentle, unfurling darkness to a feature-heavy mixtape, a series of well-chosen collaborations—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJJyKlRxyvA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Run the Jewels</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNbFc-fa-ww"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FKA twigs</a>, most recently—and now a first album, <i>Aquaria</i>. It's hollowly explosive and impeccably engineered; it's a ball of static electricity, its aesthetic distinct. And nevertheless, Boots remains in his own shadow, his debut album eclipsed by his debut.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a musician, Boots has an ear for sweet melody and a percussive, subtle, muscular style. His instincts cleave to R&amp;B easily, and innovate from inside the genre; you can hear this happy marriage clearly on ""Haunted,"" the Beyoncé meditation that was originally a Boots track called ""I'm Onto You."" <i>Aquaria</i> recalls that track's sound world directly: the instrumentation that rattles and slaps, the vocal line narrow. <i>Aquaria </i>itself is a rock album cumulatively – its soul is Mad Max and Jesus' Son, as if someone pushed Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead underwater and made them kiss – but Boots's primary instinct is genre agnosticism<span style=""line-height: 24px;"">. </span><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">This is an enormous benefit to the artists who work with him, but it's often a detriment when he's left alone.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a rule, Boots' instrumentals are much more persuasive and emotionally precise than his vocals. The slinky and rabble-rousing title track is a highlight, and not coincidentally because <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27671-deradoorian/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Angel Deradoorian</a> is paired against a great, fat, delicate clap in the beat. ""I Run Roulette,"" another standout, is hard-edged pop that rides the contrast between the pitch-black riot that serves as the backdrop and the verses, which come very close to bubble-grunge.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But Boots has an imprecise delivery as a vocalist. When he sings, or just as often sing-raps, you often forget what he's trying to say. Part of the difficulty lies in the lyrics. They're half-heartedly combative, noncommittally weird, full of half-clever neologisms: like the song title ""Oraclies,"" for ""oracle"" and ""lies."" On ""Bombs Away,"" Boots sings: ""All the wolves are famous/ Hide the rich and shameless/ Thirsty like an addict/ Hope is for the tragic/ Sell me down a new stream/ New world has new dream."" The same restless, idle soothsaying comes in on ""C.U.R.E.,"" a track that aches for a Run the Jewels guest verse (El-P is a co-producer on <i>Aquaria) </i>but, with Boots at the helm, sounds almost, truly, like Crazytown. There's a slightness in his voice that he doesn't use well; there's a melodic whimsy in his aesthetic that's best matched either with formidable guest charisma or else with his own production, its taut anxiety left unverbalized, slicing and revving away.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As on </span><i>WinterSpringSummerFall</i><span>, snippets of melody are briefly mesmerizing here; on </span><i>Aquaria</i><span>, the old-fashioned slow-dance ballad ""Only"" is a beautiful lament. ""I am the only one alive,"" he sings, then switches: ""You are the only one alive."" Those are your options, solipsism or fixation; the album whirls between the two poles to occasionally claustrophobic effect.</span><span> Each song confines you to a small set of characters: a bassline, a beat knocking, a squidge of sonic interference, a melody. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For all of Boots' fluidity and technical proficience, his solo work seems hampered by his attachment to pop, which doesn't fit his elusive profile. </span><span><i>Aquaria</i> could explode</span><span> live, with two drummers at Boots' back. But in speakers, the album feels just pop enough in intention that its pleasures seem noticeably absent; with a few strong exceptions, the album could be a folder of songs waiting for someone else to bring them to life. Boots has talent enough to make a star, or to elevate a star to a new realm. You wonder who his next one will be.</span></p></div>"|21139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21139-aquaria/|5.9|Jia Tolentino

Both are northerners with cocaine-centric worldviews – French Montana comes from a rap outfit called Coke Boys and Fetty Wap's breakout single is called ""Trap Queen"" – but they don't share much else in common at the moment. Fetty's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21043-fetty-wap/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> recently hit Number One on the Billboard 200 after a string of trap ballads became Top 10 hits, and French is in the process of trying to muster up some much-needed buzz after a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18178-french-montana-excuse-my-french/"" target=""_blank"">commercial flop</a> and a series of mixtapes that failed to stick. They are also two very different types of trappers: French is a materialist with tunnel vision and Fetty is a hopeless romantic penning Pyrex love poems. They go about dealing in different ways, but they traffic the same thing, and on their collaborative mixtape <i>Coke Zoo</i> they find common ground in cocaine rap's tropes—and in their shared penchant for hook-driven songs.</p>
<p><i>Coke Zoo</i> disproves any notion that Auto-Tune is the great equalizer. When Fetty uses it, his voice soars. When French uses, phrases flat-line. It can be jarring going from Fetty's voice, which is robust and full, to French's, which is flat and without depth. French hitches a ride on the Fetty bandwagon for many of his best contributions, but his approach to writing is far more elementary (On ""Freaky"": ""I'ma hit it like a dog/ Then I'ma pass it to my dog""), and it's Fetty's knack for melody that makes songs like ""Power"" so appealing.</p>
<p>Many of the ideas and sounds on <i>Coke Zoo</i> feel like Fetty Wap b-sides and leftovers: ""Sometimes"" is a leaked Fetty Wap song from July (""I Wonder"") with a French verse tagged on. ""Angel"" once again showcases the stunning skill set of the trap balladeer (""And I make all this guap just to show you it's ours"") before French Montana sucks out all of the energy with lifeless vocals and a mood-breaking verse. On ""Gangsta Way"", a repurposed Chris Brown song with a French verse, he takes an otherwise solid record and stifles its momentum. It's weird that French Montana, who is one of the more <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/iE8qxXScDT/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> interesting characters in hip-hop</a>, often writes such simple and boring raps, and on <i>Coke Zoo</i>,standing next to Fetty, he somehow seems even duller.</p>
<p>There are some outliers. Unsurprisingly, French delivers his best performances on the French Montana songs, where he gets to operate in his own space without Fetty creeping over his shoulder. The Lil Durk-featuring ""See Me"" is French's strongest use of Auto-Tune on the tape over a trudging rhythm, sax, and piano chords. On ""Concentration"", he takes a minor piano riff (courtesy of the Mekanics and MIXX) and makes one of his signature repetitive, bass-heavy jams. But as the chanting Fetty Wap joint ""Damn Chainz"" proves, there isn't much French can do better than his trapping Jersey counterpart. <i>Coke Zoo</i> is an interesting experiment that showcases why the stocks of these two rappers seem to be headed in two different directions.</p></div>"|21251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21251-coke-zoo/|6.6|Sheldon Pearce

They’re like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Roger Corman</a> of underground music, churning out releases, inspiring other low-budget noise-auteurs, galvanizing scenes both locally in Michigan and globally in festivals and collaborations. Many of their blunt album titles have a schlock-horror feel: <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8728-slicer/"">Slicer</a></i>, <i>Dread</i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8730-burned-mind/"">Burned Mind</a></i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9432-human-animal/""><i>Human Animal</i></a><i>.</i> That feel is in the music too. At turns scary, funny, dramatic, and transfixing, Wolf Eyes’ morphing sound has one constant: creepy, thick tension.</p>
<p>The trio’s B-movie game is in full effect on <i>I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces</i>, whose title sounds like either a pulpy confessional or a campy drug-education filmstrip. Song names feel like lost movies too: ""T.O.D.D."" as killer-robot sci-fi, ""Asbestos Youth"" as mean-streets teen flick, ""Cynthia Vortex AKA Trip Memory Illness"" as LSD-soaked journey into madness. Lyrics reference drowning heads, toxic thoughts, burning hairs, suffocation cages. If this album getting released the day before Halloween is a coincidence, it sure is a lucky one.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the music on <i>I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces</i> contains all the ominous suspense of a classic horror movie. Each track oozes with eerie tones and seat-edge momentum, such that something terrifying seems to always lurk around the corner. The album even mimics the narrative arc of a thriller: the first few tracks gradually heighten the plot, until action explodes in the damaged-punk climax of ""Enemy Ladder"" and its tale of ""twisted lands of severed hands."" The denouement of ""Cynthia Vortex"" follows, ending with singer Nate Young’s chopped-up groans that evoke a victim’s final gasps of air.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Though he’s an equal partner in sound-crime with bandmates John Olson and James Baljo, Young is the star of </span><i>I Am a Problem</i><span>’s cinematic tremors. His jaw-clenched snarls and subliminal seething get under your skin. Razor-like moans in ""Twister Nightfall"" curl sharply around a monster-march beat and Baljo’s guitar grind, while Olson’s creaky noises on ""T.O.D.D."" rhyme with Young’s yelps. Even on ""Enemy Ladder"", where frantic rhythms swirl into a cloud, Young's bark center things like the piercing eye of a pulsing storm.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Beyond his own vocal dexterity, Young’s recent move toward more subdued music in his solo work (often under the name Regression) has steered Wolf Eyes to a place where small shifts can make huge ripples, and hypnosis is as powerful as confrontation. One of the best Regression albums is aptly titled </span><span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16123-stay-asleep-regression-vol-2/"">Stay Asleep</a></i>, </span><span>and Young has developed a keen knack for sonically replicating nightmares—""I burn my dreams just to stay warm,"" he sings in ""T.O.D.D.""—and making gripping music from dark shadows and subtle motion.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In fact, </span><span><i>I Am a Problem: Mind in Pieces</i> </span><span>may be too somnambulant for noise-hounding Wolf Eyes heads, or newcomers impatient for quicker cuts to the chase.

Acts like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4936-the-lemonheads/"">Lemonheads</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1899-juliana-hatfield/"">Juliana Hatfield</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4014-matthew-sweet/"">Matthew Sweet</a> disguised depressive sentiments in plain sight by pairing them with chiming guitars and tuneful fuzz—you could sing along to some of their songs for weeks before even noticing they might be a cry for help. So it's easy to see why Laura Stevenson looked to power pop's flannelled era for her fourth album, <i>Cocksure</i>. The New York singer-songwriter has never shied from self-effacing thoughts, and by dialing up the pop she gives herself even more cover to let her antipathy run wild. It's her most disaffected record yet, but it's so spirited you could easily mistake it for her happiest.<br/> <br/> Stevenson's '90s makeover represents a sharp course correction from her sleeper 2013 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18037-laura-stevenson-wheel/"">Wheel</a></i>. That record was a true singer-songwriter affair, rooted in folk-rock and country and highlighted by ornate ballads flushed with tasteful strings and horns. She clearly poured a lot of time into it. <i>Cocksure</i>, on the other hand, is as assured and impulsive as its title. Though it's bookended by two big, showy numbers that would have would have slotted seamlessly onto <i>Wheel</i>— ""Out With a Whimper"", a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3575-rilo-kiley/"">Rilo Kiley</a>-sized emotional wallop, and the regal grand finale ""Tom Sawyer / You Know Where You Can Find Me""—the rest is driven by swift riffs and bubblegum hooks. Listeners who thought Stevenson's former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Don+Giovanni"">Don Giovanni</a> labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee/"">Waxahatchee</a> might have done well to lighten <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20437-ivy-tripp/""><i>Ivy Tripp</i></a> with another <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14997-waxahatchee-coast-to-coast/"">""Coast to Coast""</a> or two will find plenty of instant gratification on this one.<br/> <br/> Stevenson's old Bomb the Music Industry! bandmate Jeff Rosenstock rejoins her here in a producer role, which might partially account for some of <i>Cocksure</i>'s punk moxie, but underneath the speedy tempos Stevenson is consumed by the same delicate subjects that have driven all of her solo records: emotional retreat, the nagging fear that she's squandered her youth, and the irrational disdain she feels for those who care enough to try to lift her from her funk. ""I'm fucking hideous and spiteful when I'm left to my devices,"" she lashes out on ""Jellyfish"", which juxtaposes the album's sweetest hook with its sourest image: Stevenson as a gelatinous blob sprawled flat on the couch, motionless and essentially dead to the world but with a stinger pointed at anybody who might dare to poke her. She doesn't need to be told it's an awful way to live; she knows. ""I'm wasting away my life and gifts on being a piece of shit,"" she concedes, if only so she doesn't have to hear somebody else say it.<br/> <br/> That all might make the album seem like a buzzkill, but it never is. One of the joys of the album is simply hearing her cycle through so many slight variations of '90s alternative, and how she always manages to find the right shade to counter her dour mood. ""Happier, Etc."" matches another plea to be left alone to slaphappy pop-punk. The exuberant guitars on ""Claustrophobe"" blast out of the same Kitty Pryde-postered garage as the <i>Blue Album</i>, while the jangly ""Life Is Long"" channels the great, underrated heroes of sad-sack '90s guitar-pop: the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6559-the-gin-blossoms/"">Gin Blossoms</a>. That band may not be the hippest touchstone for a millennial songwriter, yet perhaps more than any other they embodied the same mantra that Stevenson wears so well on <i>Cocksure</i>: When life gives you lemons, sugar the fuck out of them.</p></div>"|21204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21204-cocksure/|7.0|Evan Rytlewski

The National have come to cast a surprisingly long shadow over indie rock: even if their booking at Barclays Center was more a case of ""huge in New York"" than ""huge in Oklahoma,"" the National have emerged as a big-tent indie mainstay because their widescreen melancholia has proven durable and difficult to emulate. EL VY provides our first look at Berninger divorced from that context and a clue toward deciphering how much of the National's appeal hinges on Berninger's <i>GQ</i>uaalude musings and how much belongs to his band's gilded alt-rock.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's easy to say EL VY's first record, <i>Return to the Moon</i>, isn't a National album; it's more difficult to put a finger on what exactly it <i>is</i>. On lecherous lead single ""I'm the Man to Be"" he's still talking about his dick, the one he swung around so much on 2005 breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5719-alligator/""><i>Alligator</i></a>. Elsewhere (""It's a Game"") he's comfortably forlorn, trading on elegant little phrases (""It's a game/ And I can't wait to see you"") like he did on 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18030-the-national-trouble-will-find-me/""><i>Trouble Will Find Me</i></a>. Knopf's jaunty and hectic keyboard-heavy arrangements are a little indistinct and, worse, noncommittal, unable to choose between glam (""I'm the Man to Be"") and lounge rock (""Paul Is Alive""), between lush folk (""No Time to Crank the Sun"") and boozy bluster (""Sad Case"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We get glimpses of how Berninger might fare as a Bryan Ferry-esque put-on—he has the wardrobe for it—or as Greg Dulli-indebted horndog, but only in the moments before Knopf's arrangements whisk him away. The particularly ill-fated opening trilogy—including ""I'm the Man to Be"", the title track, and ""Paul Is Alive""—reek of that fake-funky, post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a> period when major labels gave odd, talented bands just enough rope to hang themselves; the results sound like Berninger and Knopf deemed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3880-soul-coughing/"">Soul Coughing</a> not haughty enough. There are cooing background vocals, dirty organs, harpsi- and power chords, but it all feels random, deployed only because <i>something</i> has to fill these spaces. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Berninger, for all his magnetism, doesn't help matters. Absent his backing band's grandeur, his poet-laureate-of-the-upwardly-mobile-schtick cedes way to a clever misanthrope in need of an editor and an Advil. The album opens with the unforgettable and irredeemable line, ""I scratched a ticket with the leg of a cricket/ And I got triple Jesus,"" straight from the Tweedy School of Left-Leaning Refrigerator-Magnet Poetry. He's still name dropping other musicians—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"">the Cramps</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"">the Minutemen</a>—but he puts too fine a point on things when, in the middle of ""Sleepin' Light"", he declares, ""Ain't no Leonard Cohen."" He's still funnier than he's given credit for (""You were supposed to bring me your brother's weed...this is heartbreaking!"") but he seems in on the joke less often. His haphazard proper nouns—""Silent Ivy Hotel"", ""Happiness, Missouri""—carry less import.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-db73cfe2-88e3-50d0-12dc-3addf4be26ac""><i>Trouble Will Find Me</i> was well-received, but there was a sense, even amongst National die-hards, that this was the last time the band, and Berninger, could coast on that particular sound. <i>Return to the Moon</i> is an unhappy departure, one that suggests that Berninger is as reliant on the National's luxe environments as they are on his all-the-wine sloganeering. And while there's nothing here that suggests Berninger and Knopf are truly incompatible, there's equally little evidence that Knopf's spirited arrangements are suited to Berninger's spotlight-gargling word soup. ""Return to the moon/ I'm dying,"" Berninger croons on the opening track. Yeah, man.</span></p></div>"|21161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21161-return-to-the-moon/|4.8|Andrew Gaerig

The records compiled here by JD Twitch of the Scottish DJ duo <a href=""http://www.optimomusic.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Optimo</a> weren't exactly a genre at the time, but they had an ideology in common. Punk rock's Pistols/Jam/Clash wave had made a lot of noise about overturning musical orthodoxy, but it was pretty much a single kind of noise. The D.I.Y. bands made it their business to overturn <i>every</i> received idea about songs and recordings: rehearsed harmoniousness, formal structures, polish of any kind. But they did like to dance, or at least bounce, and some of them liked tunes, too. None of the artists on <i>[Cease &amp; Desist] DIY!</i> were ever, ever going to make it onto the charts--or so they figured at the time--but they wanted it to be known that they weren't rejecting pop values out of ignorance.</p>
<p>If you were looking for these sorts of records fifteen or twenty years ago, when anybody other than collectors still had them, you'd paw through 7-inch bins from which the Buzzcocks and Young Marble Giants singles had already been nabbed. The sound came almost exclusively from England in the years of this compilation's subtitle. Its record sleeves were predominantly monochrome, or black and white and pink, although silkscreened artwork (as with the sole release by Sara Goes Pop, from which ""Sexy Terrorist"" is taken here) was also acceptable. Uneven Letraset type, or handwritten band names and song titles, are a good sign; so are record labels with names like Fuck Off Records and It's War Boys, and what-were-they-thinking band names. The Spunky Onions' ""How I Lost My Virginity"", for instance, comes from their ""split single"" with the Ghettoberries, who were of course the same group. </p>
<p>Twitch's sequence bends the usual rules for scene compilations. It's not all obscure artists—Thomas Leer, whose electropop single ""Private Plane"" appears here, went on to be half of the super-slick new wave band Act. Instead of surveying as many bands as possible, it includes two different tracks by the cunningly named Distributors: ""TV Me,"" a sort of answer song to the Normal's ""T.V.O.D."", and a curdled dub piece called ""Never Never"". It even ventures a bit outside of its own time range: a 1984 album track by the 012 is gerrymandered in on the grounds that it was recorded in 1981. </p>
<p>All of those turn out to be fine decisions on Twitch's part, because <i>[Cease &amp; Desist]</i>  manages to pull together recordings by a bunch of desperately alienated artists into a remarkable, eye-opening and ingeniously sequenced album. It's arranged into four four-song suites (there's no CD version of the album, but there is a double LP), each with a distinct focus. The first side is four stone classics featuring piping-voiced women singers; three of its four bands are by splinter projects of the Homosexuals (whose 1978 ""Hearts In Exile"" single is a fountain from which a lot of this music springs).</p>
<p>In particular, ""C'est Fab"", a 1982 single credited to Nancy Sesay and the Melodaires<span>—</span>a Homosexuals-related group never heard from before or since<span>—</span>justifies this compilation's existence all by itself. It's a struggle for supremacy between a rhythm section that's trying to play crisp, bouncy funk and musicians who are doing their utmost to derail it (a singer squeaking uncertainly and out of tune at the very top of her range, an out-of-control trumpeter streaking through the studio, a male chorus with comedy accents, somebody dropping in cascades of fist-hammered dub piano). Everybody ends up winning.</p>
<p>That's followed by a set of tracks that use the materials of synth-pop to build weirder and more obsessive structures than the stuff that was starting to turn up on the charts. (The highlight there is Dorothy's ""Softness"", an uncanny, close-miked spoken piece whose backing band includes both Genesis P-Orridge and Alex Fergusson, shortly before they formed Psychic TV.) The album's third side begins with three pieces inspired by the messiest extremes of Jamaican dub--a huge influence on that generation of British musicians--and ends with a song that recalls dub more or less by accident: the slow, sneering 1978 single ""Violence Grows"", by a wobbly band of teenagers called ""Fatal"" Microbes, fronted by a monomaniacal-sounding then-14-year-old who went by the name Honey Bane. (By the end of 1981, she would have a legitimate UK Top 40 single of her own, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyg2eqt-tgY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Turn Me On Turn Me Off""</a>.) </p>
<p>The final suite of <i>[Cease &amp; Desist]</i> highlights the D.I.Y. scene's connections to the punk rock sound and ethos that made it possible. In another compilation's context, actually, the Fakes' ""Look Out"" and the Prats' ""Disco Pope"" would just seem like ineptly performed punk songs, which arguably they were. But the genius of D.I.Y. was that it made any bug a feature: these records' aesthetic framed every off-key vocal or mangled rhythm as a rebellion against the boredom of sonic orthodoxy, and they are never for an instant boring.</p></div>"|21100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21100-cease-desist-diy-cult-classics-from-the-post-punk-era-1978-82/|8.4|Douglas Wolk

The arrangements on <i>Technomancer</i> frequently play like droning or piercing alarms, particularly on tracks like “Sick Machine” and “Death Condition,” the latter of which is laden with clunky, mechanical percussion that makes it sound like a vintage video game. Whereas Pictureplane’s 2011 record <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15635-thee-physical/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Physical</a> </i>spun queer and cyborg theory into fuzzy house-inspired electronica, <i>Technomancer</i> plays like a soundtrack to a sci-fi dystopian film. It works well as a concept record about trying to break out of one’s oppressive urban regime, with Egedy weaving his whispery conspiracy theories into every track.</p>
<p>But while Pictureplane’s signature ’90s-evoking female vocal samples might sing soulfully in the distance, the record feels drained of the energy his previous albums showcased. The common setting on <i>Techomancer</i> is slowmo, with most tracks favoring ethereal, romantic ’80s synths over the pumped up, choppy compositions on <i>Thee Physical</i>. Even the breakbeat intro on “Harsh Realm” cuts out a minute in, favoring a more chilled out, awkward see-saw synth progression before returning to the sound of the song’s start. The blaring airhorns and record scratching sounds on “Street Pressure” feel like they’re working against the soft, sultry melody Egedy builds on that song, like a jokey nod to traditional club music. All of this seems at odds with the sound Pictureplane has cultivated thus far. There’s a tame, almost downtempo vibe to a lot of this record that keeps it from beginning to end in a sluggish, not very dance-friendly territory.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 24px;""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-a63def67-c5a6-0430-94de-f0fb4056ceca""><i>Technomancer</i><span> is certainly Egedy’s most nicely produced output yet, with his voice coming through stronger than ever on a lot of these songs. “Crack all the windows downtown, it’s that new American noise,” he sings to a “renegade street trash” on the more traditional, radio-friendly pop track “Riot Porn.” But the noise of </span><i>Technomancer</i><span> just plays too comfortably. </span><i>Technomancer</i><span> is very high concept in its man vs. machine dystopian themes, but the darkwave-edged beats Egedy constructs, while bleak, don’t possess the same level of imagination. In seemingly trying to make more cinematic and visionary electronica he ends up making pretty lackluster, slow-burning pop. On </span><i>Technomancer</i><span> Egedy’s typically wire-frayed, wall-of-sound ’90s mixtape sound feels stripped into something more pedestrian rather than futuristic. </span></span><br/></span></p></div>"|21162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21162-technomancer/|5.9|Hazel Cills

YG adapted LA gangster rap tradition to a modern production palette on <i>My Krazy Life</i>, while Kendrick Lamar and Vince Staples deconstruct the genre’s tropes and ideologies. Yet far from Southern California's party-driven nostalgia and cerebral critique, a Sacramento-based underdog on a shoestring budget has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3MvzBPecF8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">exploded</span></a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=mozzy%20bladadah&amp;src=typd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">underground</span></a>, offering a bleak, confrontational take on street rap that’s at once urgent and unsettling. <i>Yellow Tape Activities</i> is Mozzy's third solo full-length this year, and his snowballing fanbase suggests grim realism still speaks to present conditions.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Although young, Mozzy didn't arrive overnight; he's been recording for half a decade. As far back as 2010 tape <i>Mozzarella Fella</i>, he displayed the skills of a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNHlo18AGrQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">gifted writer</span></a>, latching onto vivid imagery: ""Pour the Patron in the Ocean Spray cran-grape/ I'm well-buttered like a Grand Slam pancake."" But over the past two years his style really snapped into focus, becoming leaner and more direct. Along with producer June on the Beat, he cultivated a sound defined mainly by narrative style rather than melody or sonic technique.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And this focus is one perpetually shaped by violence—think of Chicago's drill scene, although Sacramento has a <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2012/10/the-30-biggest-criminal-trials-in-rap-history/c-bo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">long history</span></a> of its own brutal reality rap. Yet Mozzy takes his own path. His rapid evolution over the past few years reached an apotheosis with 2014's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzmUvtv6IbA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">""Next Body on You""</span></a>, on which Mozzy’s disconcerting lyrics insistently pressure the listener into the role of a crew hitman: ""Next body on you, 'cause you don't never do it."" <span>June's production, a canned loop that sounds like a forgotten arcade game theme, sounds worlds away from the booming maximalism of Lex Luger</span>; the song's teeth are entirely lyrical, not musical, and this juxtaposition backlights Mozzy's unflinching audacity. His unprecedented directness makes murder less abstract, an absurdity transformed, seen through the more familiar lenses of peer pressure and shared burdens.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Yellow Tape Activities</i> lacks the immediate highs of previous Mozzy tapes <i>Bladadah</i> and <i>Gangland Landscape</i>, but the album retains the rare consistency for which the rapper is known. There are no Mozzy filler verses. Nothing here seems aimed at the pop charts, although Mozzy's gift for a potent chorus suggests this isn't far from his reach. Opener ""Property of the Ave"" epitomizes his gift for morbid hooks, tossing off sticky lyrics with unbothered ease: ""He ain't never bodied nobody on our behalf.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The darkness of his world is one brought to life by its unapologetic, almost ascetic discipline, focusing on a few major themes: loyalty, purposeless murder, and drug abuse. All are linked by an ever-present pain which can be spoken of in art but never expressed in reality. This comes through on the fatalism of ""Ain't Shit Happen"" (""You don't slide for your niggas like I do for mine/ Living on the borderline of suicide"") and the way he considers his mother's concern as just another threat (""I don't care about my life like my momma care""). These are strict parental-advisory raps. The very visual and ever-present violence is disturbing, an art form pressed to its limit. He pushes gangster rap tropes in your face, placing them in unexpected, discomforting formulations.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That this remains gut-wrenching despite years of gangster cliches is one aspect of his artfulness; that we keep listening despite the shock is another. In part, this is owed to the musicality of his flow, the particular way in which he packs in syllables and slant rhymes in memorable patterns. The stitching is wholly unique and feels brand new. It's present in the density of his slang, which adapts nearby Bay Area terms and Chicago street slang but submerges them in a local dialect that takes time to decipher. Mozzy slides, slithers, wiggles; his illas will wolf on 'em, back door 'em, breathe on 'em; guns become drum sticks, chop stixx, yop sticks. This isn't simple decoration. Every verse is written with bar-to-bar purposefulness that leaves listeners hanging onto each line. Its as if his ideas were carved from cliche with a straight razor.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mozzy’s art is at once shockingly new and alarmingly bleak. Or really, the situations he describes are bleak, as Mozzy is an artist whose feet <a href=""https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/sacramentos-bad-rap/content?oid=16642245"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">may still be intertwined</span></a> with the world that shaped him. Rather than a glorification of violence, the unremitting effect of his music is ceaselessly dire—the upsetting vision of one man from Sacramento's tough Oak Park neighborhood.</span></p></div>"|21154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21154-yellow-tape-activities/|7.5|David Drake

It is a work about grief, yes, but a work wholly without self-pity, a work that urges slowly forward. It is a work about how grief ebbs eventually, with attention and time.</p>
<p>Lobo is an expert in how nearly microscopic musical changes can have an enormous emotional effect, and the opening title track is a master class on this phenomenon. It's built on gauzy layers of synth-wash just a step or a half-step away from one another, and as Lobo introduces a layer or pulls one back the subtle movement causes the whole track to shiver, like a spider’s web trembling below the movement of tiny feet. Her timing has to be impeccable to achieve this, and it is. Her vocal melody also stays within a relatively small range for most of the song, functioning more as an additional instrumental/ambient layer—pushed back in the mix, hovering suspended in delay—than a traditional vocal line winding around and through the instrumentation. It is a dense song with a dark heart that only truly shows itself near the end of the track, but it never feels murky.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17640-tropic-of-cancer-i-woke-up-and-the-storm-was-over/"">""I Woke Up and the Storm Was Over""</a> is more glacial in pace than the title track, but with a minimal heartbeat ticking at its core. It stretches luxuriously, like a cat's yawn, all choral synth and tidal sweep and percussive shoegaze bass, the sort that sounds like a big piano. On this one, Lobo’s vocals sit more atop the mix, more the focal point, more the driver. There is something in it that feels immensely, strangely hopeful.</p>
<p>If the title track is slowly running water and ""I Woke Up and the Storm Was Over"" is the glacier formed as that water starts to freeze, the closing track, ""When the Dog Bites"", is its iced-over final form. Droning and sparse in comparison to the highly textural tracks before it, ""When the Dog Bites"" throws Lobo’s voice into final heavy relief. When the bass drum hits, it feels like a communication across a vast expanse. The entire record feels composed in the way a classical piece does: a tale of grief in three movements, a tale of the sick motion of heartbreak eventually becoming still and distant, if not forgotten, as one's own sense of self becomes more pronounced. It is a delicate and painful journey, and one worth taking at Lobo’s side.</p></div>"|21176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21176-stop-suffering-ep/|7.1|Jes Skolnik

On the cover of his new <i>Gahdamn! </i>EP he appears in comic-book form, standing<i> </i>several stories tall and smacking down a Godzilla-type creature. In the middle of the EP is a ""Redemption THEME"", which sounds like the music you would hear as Mario finally rescues Princess Peach after many unsuccessful tries in other castles. In this narrative, he's a righteous hero who exploded into the public consciousness with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17531-dram-cha-cha/"">a song that sampled ""Super Mario World""</a>, <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/24bNJOPwwA/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">had Beyoncé dancing</a>, and, directly or not, influenced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>’s <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17609-drake-hotline-bling/"">biggest hit since 2013</a>. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This triumphant storyline makes a lot of sense, but <span>since D.R.A.M. has remained under the radar since, it’s a fair question to ask: Can he escape ""Cha Cha""? </span></span>The<i> Gahdamn! </i>EP, much like this year’s previous<a href=""http://indy.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/31159/dram-1epicsummer.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> #1 Epic Summer </i>EP</a>, isn't designed to answer questions. It's a fun, high-energy record that crisscrosses hip-hop, R&amp;B, soul, electronic music, and even rock for about half an hour. Nothing is as immediate as ""Cha Cha"", but D.R.A.M. has other things up his sleeve. The remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17616-dram-ft-donnie-trumpet/"">""$""</a> replaces the original’s minimal piano and reverb with a bombastic horn section that builds around the earworm hook, ""this be that shit that make a nigga get off his ass and get money."" It’s a swelling, giant moment that seems to fit squarely with the persona D.R.A.M. is selling and the company he’s keeping.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">However, he also goes some weird places. On ""Wit the Shits"", D.R.A.M. resembles no one more than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2902-biz-markie/"">Biz Markie</a>, a punch-drunk presence on the mic who speak-raps his way around a song about doing drugs with a girl who <i>also</i> likes doing drugs. On the sweet, vintage-sounding R&amp;B cut ""I’ll Be Back Again"" he toes a line between silliness and earnestness, singing the line ""I really be contemplating on coming inside of you,"" punctuated with a ""woo!"" He recalls (and maybe parodies) the lighthearted bluntness of the most honest ""baby-making"" soul songs. (""I really be contemplating on making new life with you"" is another great line here.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31140-sza/"">SZA</a> gives voice to the implied female presence on the other end of the gorgeous ""Caretaker"", which originally appeared as an interlude on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32988-donnie-trumpet-the-social-experiment/"">Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20664-surf/""><i>Surf</i></a>. This moment, expertly sequenced as the EP’s penultimate track, underlines the artist I think D.R.A.M. wants to be—an outsized musical omnivore who mixes Maxwell-style neo-soul with Too $hort-style frankness. He ends with the mission statement ""Okden"", expressing a wish to collaborate with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a> (""but it must be special""), touching on working with Rick Rubin, and managing a quick line about his appearnce: ""I step in places all dreaded like ‘he must be ghetto,’"" which is the closest we get to glimpsing the ""real"" D.R.A.M. outside of viral hits and the self-conscious weirdness.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-236549bb-a4da-d559-9248-901f638f9021""><span><i>Gahdamn!</i> is D.R.A.M.'s second release in the year that feels playful and low-stakes, and it would be nice if he made something that felt more... <i>complete. </i>But even when he doesn’t re-capture the madness of his biggest hit, he ignites a few other fires. <i>Gahdamn!</i> <span>is a breezy sprint through many styles, demonstrating a multi-faceted artist putting all his influences in a basket, shaking them around, and seeing what comes out the other end.</span></span></span></p></div>"|21226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21226-gahdamn-ep/|6.9|Matthew Ramirez

He's in debt; his friends are getting married; his hands are frozen; he's stuck in the city; and worst of all, his songs are starting to sound the same. The world is moving past him, blurring into formlessness, and his music as Car Seat Headrest is an attempt to slow down and make sense of the rush.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Teens of Style</i> is technically a compilation, comprising songs dating back to 2011 that were re-recorded for his Matador debut. (<i>Teens of Denial</i>, a planned 2016 release, will be his first Matador album of entirely new<b> </b>material.) You can hear the revised sound as a composite of the label's history: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided by Voices</a>' ear for cracked pop oddities, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"">Belle and Sebastian</a>'s emotional directness, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>'s intimate approach to jamming, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26519-stephen-malkmus-and-the-jicks/"">Stephen Malkmus</a>' ability to get wordy without forgetting to rock out. As a songwriter, Toledo is both present and detached, capable of living in a moment while floating above it. A self-summarization comes on the brawny ""Strangers"", when he deadpans a series of autobiographical quips: ""Car seat is a menace to the public,"" ""Car seat is a genetic stop sign,"" ""Car seat's nervous and the lights are bright.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On that song, we find out the young Toledo fell in love with Michael Stipe: ""I took lyrics out of context and thought, 'he must be speaking to me.'"" His confusion over purposefully abstract lyrics may have turned him into a literalist, someone endeavoring to explain every twist and turn of his interior state. His lyrics are rapaciously intelligent, with a knack for wry humor. Take a lyrical adjustment on the new recordings, for example, that reflects the shift in his life status: ""Times to Die"" swaps a couplet about sneaking his way to musical success into a meditation on the existence of a higher power, like God or (even better) Matador founder Chris Lombardi (""Got to have faith in the one above me/ Got to believe that Lombardi loves me""), who will help decide whether or not Toledo is destined to be a cult hero.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Teens of Style</i> has a noticeably jagged quality; unbelievably, it used to sound even DIY-ier. (The original versions can be found on Car Seat's <a href=""https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a>.) The new recordings retain their rough edge, but there's luminescence in the production—the percussion is crisper, the guitars are brighter, and Toledo's singing is a lot more pronounced. The effect is an album that's bookish, but not sedentary. He sells abstruse metaphors and lyrical concepts with every ounce of himself, like failing to do so would mean the end of the world.<b> </b>In this way, he's a cousin of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"">Joanna Newsom</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/"">Bright Eyes</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3141-okkervil-river/"">Okkervil River</a>, who never let their prodigious literary intelligence get in the way of crafting something you might actually enjoy listening to.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To (sort of) quote Brandon Flowers: He's human <i>and </i>rocker. The existential despair of ""Something Soon"" is crystallized in a blown-out chorus, while he uses a hypnotic keyboard line to make the haunting ""Maud, You're Gone"" a prom song for moody kids. A spectral choir comes through a radio at the start of ""Sunburned Shirts"" before breaking into a scratchy pop gem, like George Harrison on anti-depressants (""I haven't looked at the sun for so long/ I forgot how much it hurt to""). Toledo's voice is weary, and carries a shred of desperation—he sounds like a third-generation cassette tape recording of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/7320-julian-casablancas/"">Julian Casablancas</a> (who, otherwise, is his complete opposite as a frontman). </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Earlier this month, I went to a Car Seat Headrest show held as part of the annual CMJ Music Marathon, where dozens of bands go to make their reputations. But Toledo began the set lying on the floor, with his microphone angled toward the ground, as the band launched into <a href=""https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/track/the-ending-of-dramamine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Ending of Dramamine""</a>, a 14-minute epic where he references <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a> and sings about only thinking about himself. If you weren't standing right at the stage, you couldn't see him. The words flowed from the void, sung by someone so overwhelmed by the moment he would rather disappear. I couldn't absorb them all at once but what I remember is the crowd standing on their toes, edging their way forward, hoping to catch a glimpse. Then, he stood up.</p></div>"|21121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21121-teens-of-style/|8.1|Jeremy Gordon

Their music was an unpredictable pile-up of rock, pop, jazz, blues, psych, noise, improv, and many far-flung global sounds—with special love for the music of the Middle East—delivered as ballads, jams, rants, plays, and pranks. Their dual passions for playing whatever they felt like and confounding any audience who would listen dovetailed perfectly, such that even their biggest fans can cite Sun City Girls moments that they found baffling or even off-putting.</p>
<p>This penchant for messiness helps explain why 1990’s <i>Torch of the Mystic</i>s is Sun City Girls’ most famous and perhaps best-loved album. The most surprising aspect of this record is how well arranged and engaging the music is. Though the trio had roots in the Arizona hardcore scene of the early '80s, no one ever pegged them as purveyors of three chords and the truth, especially given the rambling releases that preceded <i>Torch</i>. But the three-chord riff that launches album opener ""Blue Mamba"" couldn't be more direct, and remains Sun City Girls’ biggest-ever earworm.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Torch of the Mystics</i> is replete with moments like that—nuggets of hypnotic tunefulness stretched into songs that feel as classic and well-worn as the dusty cassettes the band uncovered on their travels around the globe (later mined for compilations on bassist/singer Alan Bishop’s <a href=""http://www.sublimefrequencies.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sublime Frequencies</a> label). You can actually whistle along to most of <i>Torch</i>’s songs—one even starts with Bishop whistling the melody for you—and even the farthest-out tunes have discernible shapes that quickly burn into memory.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The most immediate images come from the guitar of Alan Bishop’s younger brother Rick. Earlier Sun City Girls albums hinted at his instrumental prowess, but it’s on full display on </span><i>Torch of the Mystics</i><span>. His playing isn’t about technical know-how or honed chops—though he clearly has both of those—but rather finding epiphanies in repetition. The curling chords of ""Esoterica of Abyssynia"" are so dizzying they seem to fold in on themselves, like a musical Möbius strip. Similar effects spin from the warped strings of ""Radar 1941"", which sounds like a water-logged surf tune that washed up from the other side of the planet.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>An equal counterpart to Rick’s guitar is the malleable voice of his sibling, Alan. The Bishops’ worldly travels clearly gave Alan an ear for all manner of singing styles, and on </span><span><i>Torch</i> </span><span>he displays the vocal capabilities to match them. At times he sounds like he’s channeling ghosts of singers past, as in the worshipful warble of ""Space Prophet Dogon"" or the strikingly-beautiful scale-riding of ""The Shining Path"". The latter is a cover of Bolivian folk song </span><span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llorando_se_fue"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Llorando se feu""</a>, </span><span>and Sun City Girls’ treatment is typical of their magical way with covers. It retains the stirring mood of the original while transposing it to a more mysterious, fantastical realm (in this case, one haunted by the </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_Western"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Spaghetti Western</span></a><span> scores of </span><span><a href=""http://www.forcedexposure.com/Features/alan-bishop-morricone/ReviewMorricone.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bishop hero</a> </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/""><span>Ennio Morricone</span></a><span>). Yet as breathtaking as his singing can be, some of Alan’s most moving vocal performances come when he yells, hums, and moans, reaching for a higher plane while simultaneously conveying pristine beauty.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That pursuit is all over </span><i>Torch of the Mystics, </i>and a big part of what makes it <span>great. It’s as much about the profundity of disorder as the clarity of structure. Though the latter may be more obvious on first listen, dig in deep and the trio’s love of surprise and confusion emerge loudly. Many tracks teeter on the edge of explosion, straddling the line between inspiration and insanity. Four of the songs were completely improvised, and all were recorded in single takes, but the album’s unity emerges from the band’s persistent vision. </span><i>Torch of the Mystics </i><span>finds a point at which chaos and order meet to become a third path—one that, in this thrilling and still-vital incarnation, only Sun City Girls could discover.</span></p></div>"|21175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21175-torch-of-the-mystics/|9.0|Marc Masters

Few have ventured further out than Jamal Moss, a Chicago producer and DJ who also records as the Sun God, I.B.M. (Insane Black Man), and under various permutations of his main alias, like Hieroglyphic Being and the Configurative or Modular Me Trio. Moss' roots lie in drum machines and synths and four-to-the-floor rhythms, but he's equally interested in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"">Sun Ra</a>'s Afrofuturist flights of fancy, and his music has been getting more and more free-form in recent years. On <i>We Are Not the First</i>, a top-notch group of collaborators—the J.I.T.U. Ahn-Sahm-Bul (or the Journey Into The Unexpected Ensemble; Moss loves his wordplay)—help him travel to some truly outerstellar reaches.</p>
<p>Moss and his ensemble recorded the album during a week of sessions in New York, and while the lineup shifts slightly throughout, it consists mainly of Arkestra bandleader Marshall Allen on saxophone and keys; Elliott Levin, a longtime member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11694-cecil-taylor/"">Cecil Taylor</a>'s ensembles, on flute and saxophone; and Shahzad Ismaily, a member of Marc Ribot's Ceramic Dog, on guitar. Ben Vida pitches in with modular synths on a few tracks, and Shelley Hirsch and Rafael Sanchez both contribute vocals—swooping, birdlike incantations and spoken-word, respectively. And then there's Greg Fox, the lightning-handed drummer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"">Liturgy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5596-zs/"">Zs</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30534-guardian-alien/"">Guardian Alien</a>, who plays on eight of the album's 11 tracks, and whose contributions are the first indicator that we've left the limits of dance music far behind.</p>
<p>A few tracks still feature Moss' trademark drum-machine chug. ""Cybernetics Is an Old Science"", strafed by echo-soaked clatter, sounds a lot like the kind of techno that Moss has been producing for the past two decades, just slathered in a three-way duel of squealing saxophones and modular synth. On ""Fuck the Ghetto / Think About Outer Space"", Moss' loping toms and hi-hats provide the frame for Sanchez' exhortation to choose space over subjection, to <i>think</i> one's way out of the ""ghetto of the mind."" ""Pussy Thumper"" rides atop hypnotic, hi-hat-heavy programming that flits between an andante 100 BPM and a dizzying double-time tempo, depending on how you hear it. And on the strutting ""Cimitière des Innocents"", Fox restricts himself to filling in the space around Moss' programming while synth and reeds run circles around each other.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, though, Fox's liquid timekeeping sets the pace, and that's where the album really takes off. The title track is an 18-minute jam featuring Carter (flute, saxophone, trumpet), Ismaily (guitar), Vida (modular synth), and Fox along with Moss' synths and electronic drums. It is a pulsing, clanging din of chirp and squeal; it feels like eavesdropping upon a dozen conversations at once. The rhythm holds it together; it's chaotic, but it's also meditative, in the same way that being alone in a crowd can be meditative. For all its length, it doesn't really go anywhere; you just drop in and drift along, buoyed by its steady turbulence. <i>We Are Not the First </i>is an album deeply invested in the idea of evolution—of apes becoming upright and then heading offworld. But in its relationship to dance music as it's conventionally understood, the album is less an evolutionary step than a quantum leap into the unknown.</p></div>"|21130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21130-we-are-not-the-first/|7.2|Philip Sherburne

Renbourn sourced the core of the tracklist from a tape labeled ""1962"" that he discovered in the attic of fellow folk revivalist Mac MacLeod, pairing those few songs with various onstage collaborations from his salad days, before he and his guitar-sparring partner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4970-bert-jansch/"">Bert Jansch</a> and their band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5191-pentangle/"">Pentangle</a>, helped redefine the scope of modern folk. Renbourn had yet to sign a record deal, so these takes are rough with their age and his youth. But the finale, a live duet with Davy Graham of ""Nobody Knows You When You’re Down Out"", is pristine, with the thin, lithe tone of the dual guitars rendered perfectly. Had Graham and a teenaged Renbourn somehow stolen into a proper studio back in 1962?</p>
<p>Actually, their Clapton <i>Unplugged</i>-like take on the American standard comes from an onstage rendezvous several decades <i>after</i> the heyday of the British folk revival. As a memento, it is quite poignant. Not only did Graham serve as a de facto mentor to Renbourn, but the younger guitarist opens this set with a hurried version of ""Anji"", <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQ5Yw_rH_c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one of Graham’s trademark numbers</a>. But as a set-closer, it’s a bit of a bore, the sound of two old friends romping through the blues for their own amusement but without much payoff.</p>
<p>Alas, that makes it a fitting close for<i> The Attic Tapes</i>, a tedious if spirited set that lets us hear Renbourn learn where folk and blues had been rather than guide where it might go. It raises more questions about archival albums than it answers of Renbourn’s genesis.</p>
<p><i>The Attic Tapes</i> mostly confirms what we already know about Renbourn and, really, the bulk of his motley crew of fellow crooners and pickers: They loved the rawness and magnetism of American blues and folk music, and they tried the best they could to recast it in their own image. There are a few originals here, like the halting and smart blues reordering of ""Plainsong"" and the peppy ""Judy"". But mostly, Renbourn plainly shows his roots. He turns Blind Boy Fuller’s doting but vaguely threatening ""Little Woman You’re So Sweet"" into the sprightly ""Beth’s Blues"". Like most every other pasty kid with a piece of carved wood and some strings, he works his way through Blind Willie Johnson’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3On4rAJdeKg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lord I Just Can’t Keep From Crying""</a>. He flits between the notes and lifts and leaps with his voice in a way that suggests he’s celebrating his own vulnerability, a young man not old enough to know how painful it all could get.</p>
<p>Likewise, Renbourn’s take on <a href=""http://www.derrolladams.org/songs/portland-town.htmlhttp://www.derrolladams.org/songs/portland-town.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Portland Town"", by itinerant and largely overlooked American banjoist Derroll Adams</a>, seems to delight in tragic lyrics about bad marriages and dead children. And his cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY4GnLGsLQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jackson C. Frank’s perfect anthem, ""Blues Run the Game""</a>, is overly emphatic, the verses brandished with unwarranted relish. It’s clear that Renbourn is an incredible guitarist, capable of making intricate patterns seem effortless even at such a young age. His jejune takes on these hard old songs suggest that he was, to date, simply an instrumentalist short on experience.</p>
<p>If you’re worried that <i>The Attic Tapes</i> is an opportunistic ploy to profit from Renbourn’s recent death, like a youthful journal published without the deceased author’s consent, don’t: Renbourn seemed enthusiastic about this project, even penning playful and informative liner notes that trace his lineage and sources more clearly than the recordings themselves. According to <a href=""http://www.worldmusic.net/store/item/TUG1089/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Riverboat Records’ owners</a>, Renbourn died the day before they would have sent him the final artwork; he never had a chance to dig deeper for exact dates on these sessions.</p>
<p>Aside from its redundancy, though, the real worry with <i>The Attic Tapes</i> stems from the way it reflects reissue-and-archival culture at large. Though many labels interested in such work do essential excavations of forgotten sessions, albums and artists, there seems to be an increasing tendency to regard most anything that’s survived as a masterpiece—as though time transformed it like common carbon into a rare diamond. Everything presumed to be lost doesn’t need to be found. The situation seems doubly pronounced when the music involves an artist we already know—or, in the case of <i>The Attic Tapes</i>, a panoply of them.</p>
<p>In some way, I wonder if our relatively new era of seemingly instant and infinite information about what our favorite singers had for breakfast or where they’re vacationing and with whom has made the salvage of such basement reels and attic tapes seem more paramount, as though we’re retroactively rebuilding as much of the past as we can. That’s an intriguing endeavor, but it doesn’t necessarily make for essential records. During his 50-year career, Renbourn contributed to several of those, from <i>Bert and John </i>and <i>The Pentangle</i> to <i>The Black Balloon</i>.

As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"">Erykah Badu</a>, who worked with him on her <i>Mama's Gun </i>album, once said during a RBMA lecture, Dilla made <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/erykah-badu-frother-of-the-month"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""beats all day long.""</a> He collected many of them onto CDs, and handed them out to friends and colleagues. These ""beat tapes"" had begun circulating across the Internet by the time he passed in 2006 at the age of 32.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dilla's work has since become fodder for dozens of compilations, posthumous ""collaborations"" like the 2013 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18685-yancey-boys-sunset-blvd/""><i>Sunset Blvd.</i></a> with Frank Nitt and his brother Illa J, and unnecessary reissues like a ""badge-shaped"" Record Store Day 2015 <a href=""http://www.recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/7859"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">version</a> of his 2001 12-inch ""Fuck the Police"". The Yancey estate has also begun issuing his beats in raw form, without vocals. (Before, they were available as ""instrumental"" accompaniments to projects like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16731-rebirth-of-detroit/""><i>Rebirth of Detroit</i></a>, which paired Dilla's beats with newly recorded vocals by various rappers.) Last year's <i>The King of Beats: Ma Dukes Collector's Box Set </i>boasted some <a href=""http://jdillathekingofbeats.storenvy.com/products/7700247-jay-dee-a-k-a-j-dilla-the-king-of-beats-ma-dukes-yancey-collectors-editi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">memorable packaging</a><span>—</span>it included four 10-inch records, a cassette, and a floppy disk formatted for an E-mu SP-1200 sampler keyboard<span>—</span>as well as an imposing $207.74 price tag.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>The King of Beats</i>, as well as 2013's <i>Lost Tapes Reels + More</i>, and now <i>Dillatronic</i> are like sketchbooks from a widely recognized master of the art form. On the latter, each track bears the spartan title ""Dillatronic 01"", et cetera. According to its promotional materials, <i>Dillatronic </i>represents his ""electronic-influenced"" material, but that's a loose theme at best. There is nothing here as gloriously techno as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ncSt5xC8Uk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nothing Like This""</a> from the 2003 EP <i>Ruff Draft</i>, or the <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> homage <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Rg5e73sfY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""B.B.E. (Big Booty Express)""</a> from his 2001 album as Jay Dee, <i>Welcome 2 Detroit</i>. If anything, many of these virtually unnamed and undated ""beats batches"" float along like the rudimentary, keyboards-and-bass-drums beats of late-'90s indie rap producers like Shawn J. Period and 88-Keys. Most have a running time of around two to three minutes, while a few last less than a minute. Yet in total, they bear traces of his superior instincts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are echoes of better-known productions here: the penetrating synth keyboard of ""Dillatronic 10"" is reminiscent of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hizl_SEn9dM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""E=MC2""</a> from <i>The Shining</i>, and track 35 unfolds a neo-soul guitar groove that evokes his work on Phat Kat's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09TqHksPWwY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dedication to the Suckers""</a>. With its enchanting yet disembodied chorus of ""ooohs,"" ""14"" is like a distant cousin of Slum Village's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-oLqMwzvBY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Get Dis Money""</a>. ""29"" whips a blaxploitation funk lick around a sample of M.O.P.'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MUGAxpI0Bc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ante Up""</a>, while a sample of Whodini's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmcQGH16NY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Escape (I Need a Break)""</a> girds the hallucinatory track 34. The latter is one of the more fully realized electronic instrumentals included here, but there are others, like the ""Tetris""-like effects on ""22"", and the ghostly electro on ""24"" that cruelly ends in 45 seconds.</p>
<p>A few of these files suggest paths unexplored. ""05"", which only lasts a minute and three seconds, weds a bhangra-like melody to a drum kit. It's an avenue Dilla's close friend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> explored more fully on his <i>Beat Konducta in India</i>. ""31"" builds like a '70s horror cut (or perhaps a porno flick?) around an unnamed woman breathing ""No"" as a solitary keyboard sound throbs creepily. ""33"" weaves around a sped-up recording of a voices chirping as if out of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Dilla's familiar techniques are evident, like his frequent use of air sirens and hard, slapping percussion. He speaks only once, near the end of the minute-and-three-second track ""39"". ""Yeah! Bounce with a nigga!"" he commands to us over loping bass and spacey keyboard effects. This might be a data dump of studio experiments, not a cohesive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17510-donuts-45-box-set/""><i>Donuts</i></a>-like experience that casual listeners might crave. </span><span>But admirers of this brilliantly inventive musician will find much to rhyme over, get inspired by, or simply bounce to on </span><i>Dillatronic</i><span>.</span></p></div>"|21156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21156-dillatronic/|7.0|Mosi Reeves

Unlike Russell, however, some of Cowley's work reached the mainstream: What <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a> was to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1185-donna-summer/"">Donna Summer</a>, Cowley was to LGBT pioneer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_(singer)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sylvester</a>—the mustachioed background figure who contemporized a disco diva’s hot soul with cool technology.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Yet unbeknownst to even most of his disco fans, Cowley also created synth compositions in the even-more-underground medium of gay porn. <i>Muscle Up</i> is the second of two releases compiling this work, spanning time spent as a student at the City College of San Francisco to the period shortly before his death in 1982, when he scored his final smashes with Sylvester, Paul Parker, Loverde, and other Bay Area acts. As with 2013's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18773-patrick-cowley-school-daze/""><i>School Daze</i></a>, </i>it takes its name from a real 1980 porn film, released by L.A.'s Fox Studio, that Cowley soundtracked. The music here documents an important cultural shift: As Super 8 gave way to VHS, DVD, and digital, much of gay and straight porn music alike would be synth-centric.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like porn itself, electronic music references reality while signaling a fantastical break from it. For gay men born in the '50s like Cowley, synths suggested a refuge from repression, an escape hatch from a world where police entrapped, beat, and jailed them; where they lost their jobs or unwillingly severed family ties. This is one of the reasons why synth-disco milestones like Summer's ""I Feel Love""—a track Cowley further intensified in his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSTf0B-9laQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">legendary 15+ minute remix</a>—resonated so strongly with gay dancers of its era: Synth music was dream/sci-fi music, and it competed with R&amp;B at the bathhouses where its suspension of time and space heightened the otherworldliness of unlimited sexual expression central to pre-AIDS gay experience, as if every man-on-man encounter after Stonewall and before Plague was a trip to the moon. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Appropriately, the first track of <i>Muscle Up, </i>""Cat's Eye"", begins with a whooshing interplanetary-wind sound, and the ominous processional tom-toms that follow lets us know that sex is about to happen in the furtive way animals anticipate an earthquake. Cowley's keys ape ceremonial trumpets much like the pseudo-horn fanfare that opens <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"">Devo</a>'s <i>Duty Now for the Future</i>. That was 1979; this piece was allegedly recorded in '75. The recording is crude and there's a moment of cacophony when two martial drum patterns crossfade and collide, but even this accidental frisson suggests porn's glitchy, clandestine low-budget production values.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a former drummer who switched to synths (but plays everything here besides didgeridoo and a bit of bass), Cowley comprehended both discipline and exploration. There's little on<i> Muscle Up</i> that sounds robotic; ""5oz of Funk"" echoes the syncopated beat and bass from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX87SBDDCFY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patti Jo's ""Make Me Believe in You""</a>. Only once do machines keep time, on a 1975 instrumental demo version of ""Somebody to Love Tonight"", a song that Cowley revisited four years later with Sylvester, yielding understated but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpFQpfryo5I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">profoundly aching results</a>. Even at this stage, it's supremely sultry, simmering with desires then considered utterly vile beyond the San Francisco bubble.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b0cb264d-62a0-aa3c-e168-64d31542ad55"">Today, the city's technology occupies a different kind of frontier, one often driven by motives not entirely artistic. And so it's instructive to hear what one guy then just blocks away from where Twitter now resides created with far cruder but perhaps more sensitive, pre-digital tools some 40 years ago. Rather than clean precision, he gets dirty invention, overheated homage. Instead of considered silences between notes, there's the strong suggestion of one man's impulsive sweat and spunk and stink. Cowley's interplanetary sex music is paradoxically earthy for the same reason his parallel cosmic club grooves were so righteous; because it reveled in freedoms long denied.</span></p></div>"|21120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21120-muscle-up/|8.1|Barry Walters

There’s the high, weeping one that turns up at the beginning of the icy psyh-Appalachia ballad ""Petal Head""; there’s the bamboo-brittle alto that crackles menacingly at the center of the rippling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17714-eartheater-wetware/"">""Wetware""</a>. And then there are all the others, rendered almost inhuman with digital effects: baritone-low and groaning, solemn and choir-like, chattering and mechanized. She layers them several at a time, so that it often seems like she’s in conversation with herself: two Drewchins—one way up high, one way down low—share the melody on""“Humyn Hymn"", making lyrics like, ""Chemical computer syringe/ Memories are fading away/ Rolling off the side of the bed,"" seem like they’re written in code that only the two singers understand.</p>
<p>It’s a fitting approach for a record which, as its title implies, deals with personal transformation; later in ""Hymn"", Drewchin sings, ""The more I look back, the more I want to look ahead,"" and she spends the bulk of the album deep-diving into herself, delivering haunting descriptions of the shapes and spirits she encounters along the way. Arriving just eight months after the first Eartheater record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20277-metalepsis/""><i>Metalepsis</i></a>, <i>Chrysalis</i> displays a startling new firmness and depth to Drewchin’s songwriting. Where her first record felt more deliberately synthetic, making ample use of synthesizers and electronics, on <i>Chrysalis</i>, Drewchin operates from a base of American folk music. Dry-board banjos and plucked acoustic guitars form the foundation of most of the songs, leaving plenty of room through which Drewchin winds her snaking voice. There are still plenty of synths, but on <i>Chrysalis</i>, they augment rather than dominate. It’s as if Drewchin had raided <i>The Anthology of American Folk Music</i> but only absorbed the songs about ghosts. The closest recent comparison would be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"">Cat Power</a>’s <i>Moon Pix</i>, but Drewchin’s songs are more expansive and more free-form, showing hints of her time spent in the psych outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30534-guardian-alien/"">Guardian Alien</a>. One of the reasons <i>Chrysalis</i> is so fascinating and absorbing is because Drewchin obliterates the notion of song structure, starting from something as time-honored as folk, but bashing down the walls and ceiling around it to create music that feels mystical and searching.</p>
<p>As much as it’s about personal change, <i>Chrysalis</i> also seems to be about discovering new ways of songwriting, one that leaves the borders porous and the time elastic. A fiddle corkscrews at the opening of the title track before Drewchin’s banjo takes over; eventually, the background is filled with the sound of a ringing telephone and a fog of electronics, a bleary canvas of sound that Drewchin’s ethereal alto gradually floats across. She recites the lyrics of the creeping ""Wetware""—""Deprogramming false fundamental makeup""—as if she’s casting a spell, while synths pulse like an android heartbeat behind her. And she begins ""Mask Therapy"" by repeating the words ""identity crisis"" over rippling, mirage-like guitar, a rhythm track that sounds like a failing air compressor thudding beneath. Songs enter and fade at their own pace, like clouds ribboning out across the sky at dusk.</p>
<p><span>The album’s title can be read two ways—the tearing of the chrysalis that allows new life, and the death of the same once that new life has begun. On ""Ecdysisyphus"", she flatly declares, ""There’s a first time for everything/ More like, everything is the first time."" At first, it seems empty—the equivalent of a dorm room stoner’s bug-eyed command to ""</span><span>Think about it, man.""</span><span> But after hearing the record that follows, it feels like a profound personal declaration. </span><i>RIP Chrysalis</i><span> is the sound of someone figuring themselves out in real time, making all of their distinct voices harmonize, and creating new musical forms to share their discoveries.</span></p></div>"|21187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21187-rip-chrysalis/|7.7|J.

It's a testament to Li's chameleonic nature that he has proven a seamless fit with the cult Japanese deep house imprint <a href=""http://www.mulemusiq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mule Musiq</a>; the UK bass driven techno label <a href=""https://nonplusrecords.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nonplus Records</a>; Berlin behemoth <a href=""http://ostgut.de/label/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ostgut Ton</a>; and Jamal Moss' purposefully abstract <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MATHEMATICS-RECORDINGS-44852936673/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mathematics Recordings</a>. Each of these labels has successfully staked out a patch of deep and slightly weird dance music territory, and Li's edgy-yet-accessible style has endeared him to the DJs who also reside there; he appeals to selectors of many stripes, as his productions consistently come to life when thundering down towards darkened dancefloors.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It is Li's professionalism that ends up being the slight undoing of <i>Under the Same Sky</i>, his second artist album and debut release for Amsterdam tastemakers <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/dkmntl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dekmantel</a>. This is the toughest-sounding version of Basic Soul Unit thus far, with walloping techno drums, old school breakbeats, and industrial percussion that replicates the grind of machinery and the scraping of metal on metal. However, he ends up drawing unwelcome attention to the downside of his talents. Li's sound is so tailored to the blast of monitor speakers and big club rigs that it bogs down under closer inspection, revealing pixelated weaknesses in the bigger picture.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are some exceptions where Li seems prepared to throw some dirt and grit into the mix, and it's always for the greater good. The slowly menacing ""Until the End Comes"" very suddenly inhabits all three dimensions, cleverly allowing a 90-second introduction of measured static and pillowy bass drum to then click into a full-bodied and richly textured version of itself. In a similar way, ""Restless in Thoughts"" works to makes disorientation seem balanced and appealing, circling around lopsided dubby loops and itchy percussive accents, and it glows with warmth. While lacking the qualities of those two tracks, ""Temptress"" and ""Without Fears"" will appeal to fans of <a href=""http://skudgeblog.skudgerecords.com/#home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skudge</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32771-levon-vincent/"">Levon Vincent</a>, who aren't at all concerned with separating the swing of house from the gruff ruggedness of techno.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Elsewhere on the album, Li is to be found mostly returning to the same sound palette. ""The Rift Between"", ""Unwavered"", and ""Landlocked"" may look to broken beats, classic techno, and electro, but they're all a little too bleak, too clean and undynamic. ""Fate in Hand"" may well be an attempt to alleviate some of the grayness toward the album's end, but its overbearing drums are too present to be enjoyable, and not textured enough to provide a good counterweight to the track's delicate and Detroit-indebted melody.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Each track of </span><i>Under the Same Sky</i><span> will undoubtedly find a home in a record bag or set list somewhere, and rightly so, as there's really nothing fundamentally wrong with any of them. As an album, though, </span><i>Under the Same Sky</i><span><i> l</i>eaves you wanting more of a moody, immersive experience, and less of its clean surfaces and precise negative spaces.</span></p></div>"|21223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21223-under-the-same-sky/|6.5|Christine Kakaire

Metal bands have always pushed themselves to be faster, heavier, more challenging, and more musically dextrous than their predecessors. That said, it's still rare when an act genuinely succeeds at altering the meta-structure of the form. Anytime a <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2745-meshuggah/"">Meshuggah</a> or <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1080-the-dillinger-escape-plan/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Dillinger Escape Plan</a> comes along, you can bet dime-a-dozen imitators will cheapen the impact of their innovations. To make matters worse, today we're swarmed by retro-obsessed bands hell-bent on recreating the vibe and tone of, well, name any year and heavy metal subgenre. Not to mention that rampant sectarianism fosters a mentality where superficial differences between camps become paramount and crossing barriers becomes a transgression.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Every now and again, though, a band comes along that sidesteps these conventions. With their debut album, last year's </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19013-yautja-songs-of-descent/"">Songs of Descent</a></i><span>, Nashville trio Yautja (named after the extraterrestrial creature from the </span><i>Predator</i><span> film series) reminds us that what we think of as metal today can be as boundless and mutable as the range that jazz had encompassed by 1970. A prog-minded act that combines grindcore and Amphetamine Reptile-era noise with the artier shades of hardcore and death metal, Yautja doesn't just stack hairpin turn after hairpin turn—an approach that was tired by technical death metal's mid-'90s peak. Instead, bassist Kayhan Vaziri, guitarist Shibby Poole, and drummer Tyler Coburn create a highly malleable, mercury-like alloy that changes shape with liquid ease yet retains the solidity of its structure. (The way their music moves, it might've been more fitting for these guys to name themselves after the villian in <i>Terminator 2</i>.)<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><span><span style=""color: #b45f06;""><br/></span></span></span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As its title suggests, the new EP </span><i>Songs of Lament</i><span> was crafted as a companion piece to the full-length, but there are some key distinctions. </span>For starters,<i> Lament</i><span> leans closer to a grimier, more punkish production aesthetic. Meanwhile, because Yautja came out of the gate with a flair for tempo changes, the lean toward slower sections this time around doesn't seem drastic. With<i> </i></span><i>Songs of Lament</i><span>, Yautja once again shows that, like the art of the fastball, sheer speed is most effective when a band can mix up its delivery and hit you from unexpected angles. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Case in point: </span><i>Songs of Lament</i><span> closes with the nine minute-plus ""Crumbling"", which climaxes in a sludge/doom buildup where Poole and Vaziri churn out an ominous riff at a crawling tempo. When Coburn suddenly explodes into a flurry of fills, followed by a blast beat and a jazzy double-time figure on the ride cymbal, the song feels like it's taking off even as it trudges through muck. That one passage speaks volumes about Yautja's mindfulness when it comes pacing. In fact, one marked contrast between </span><i>Lament</i><span> and its predecessor is that the EP plays like an extended suite of music. As for subject matter, all three of Yautja's members write lyrics and supply vocals, with Vaziri doing the lion's share of the barking. And while the cutting lyrical content does linger at the irate end of the emotional spectrum, Yautja's nonpartisan musical approach lends the words a more sophisticated hue by default.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-6afa22df-953e-7613-9f27-ead9d76b0631""><span>Understandably, </span><span><i>Songs of Lament</i></span><span> doesn't accomplish as much as its full-length companion does in terms of furthering metal's evolution. Moreover, the new material is rendered somewhat two-dimensional by a mix that sounds flatter in comparison to </span><i>Songs of Descent</i><span>'s full-fidelity production. Still, the new songs certainly show what this band is capable of when it makes subtle tweaks in its approach to structure. Indeed, </span><i>Songs of Lament</i><span> extends the pleasures of the debut while whetting the appetite for what new wrinkles Yautja might have in store the next time around. </span></span></p></div>"|21151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21151-songs-of-lament-ep/|7.0|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

He further restrains his sound on <i>Bad Neighbor,</i> a collaborative LP with rappers M.E.D. and Blu. This is a light-hearted jaunt, with the rappers leaping from topic to topic, as if passing a blunt between verses. Don’t expect anything profound here. At its core, <i>B</i><i>ad Neighbor</i> is about three dudes and their friends, spitting verses over great beats without sweating structure.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The producer fits well into this free-flowing group. He also feeds off seemingly random ideas, connecting dots between misplaced vocal clips and Afro-rock samples, and despite his talents he can be easy to take for granted. M.E.D. had a nice showing on 2004’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"">Madvillainy</a></i>, the revered outing from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"">MF DOOM</a> and Madlib, but his output has been sparse from there. Blu has been incredibly prolific, but many of his releases are marred with improper mixing and unfocused rhymes, with as many standouts (<i>Below the Heavens</i>, <i>Her Favorite Colo(u)r) </i>as bricks, like <i>Jesus.</i> and the short-lived <i>ucla</i>. On their own, all of these guys are good but sometimes get overlooked.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i> Bad Neighbo</i>r is their second release. In 2013, the trio put out <i>The Burgundy </i>EP, powered by the fluid single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JlZRd8TSc8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Burgundy Whip""</a>. That song re-emerges near the end of <i>Bad Neighbor, </i>but it feels like an afterthought compared with the stronger, more vivid material around it. ""Peroxide"", featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"">Dâm-Funk</a> and DJ Rome, resembles ""Planet Rock""-era electro-funk, and the MCs bounce nimbly atop its darting synthetics. ""The Stroll"" flashes a bright, disorienting synth like a flood light, the beat so full of little noises it's like an event itself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33213-andersonpaak/"">Anderson .Paak</a>, the grit-voiced singer/rapper who featured prominently on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20935-compton/""><i>Compton</i></a> and who recently dropped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21049-the-anderson-paak-ep/"">his own noteworthy EP</a>, appears almost out of nowhere on <i>Bad Neighbor</i> track ""The Strip"", lending his strained voice to the proceedings. There are a few appearances like that, and they feel purposefully casual, allowing everyone to thrive on their own terms. On ""Finer Things"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1627-the-foreign-exchange/"">Foreign Exchange</a> frontman Phonte Coleman sings the hook and raps about adult romance. MF DOOM shows up on ""Knock Knock"" to offer his signature disconnected one-liners. <i>Bad Neighbor </i>whizzes by in a blunted haze, which might be an insult to another project, but it works well here, when the stakes are low and the mood is most important.</p></div>"|21155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21155-bad-neighbor/|7.2|Marcus J.

At home she is a known quantity: She capped off a string of EPs and touring gigs with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5734-lykke-li/"">Lykke Li</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29745-woodkid/"">Woodkid</a> with her debut <i>Chaleur Humaine</i> in June of 2014. But the U.S. release this fall of <i>Humaine</i>, repackaged as a self-titled debut, marks her introduction to the American market: Some of the French lyrics were redone in English, accompanied by a couple of Anglophone bonus tracks. As with the French edition, the record starts with an unequivocal declaration of her arrival. ""I'm a man now,"" she sings in a bold voice on ""iT"", ""And there's nothing you can do to make me change my mind.""</p>
<p>A few verses later, she offers up a line whose regal, gory quality seems worthy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"">Lorde</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a>: ""I'll rule over all my dead impersonations."" Out of context, it sounds like a very 2015 pop move: burying past incarnations of yourself that the public never even witnessed and calling yourself king from the off, fueled by nothing but divine belief in your own selfhood. Letissier has the chops and charisma to pull off this role, too: ""iT"" has gorgeous minimal production—just a sputtering beat, tarnished synth glimmers, and canny employ of sprite-like backing vocals. Her expressive voice leads the lone melody, at first vulnerable and then rasping with defiance.</p>
<p>But it's a feint: Letissier spends the next 11 songs pulling back from this grandstanding (which was inspired by her discarding her feminine identity as a teenager) to explore the nuances of her queer identity and what that means in private and public spheres. On the way, she comes out with some pin-sharp lyrics to rival collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"">Perfume Genius</a>' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7OSSUwPVM4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""no family is safe when I sashay,""</a> full of daring and vulnerable truths. ""Science Fiction"" unravels on spacey burbles that underpin the alienation she and her partner feel when out in public: ""They look at me when I stare at you... In this sea of eyes, every move's a coup."" Letissier reclaims the discrimination she experiences for not passing as a prescribed gender ideal on ""Half Ladies"", which moves between percussive gasps indebted to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a> and pared-back, angular funk: ""Every insult I hear back/ Darkens into a beauty mark.""</p>
<p>That particular image seems to reference the source of her own liberation. A few years ago, beset by depression, Letissier ran away from college in Paris and crossed the Channel to London, where she was taken under the wing of three Soho drag artists. They heard her humming and encouraged her to make music, so she locked herself away for weeks, garrote-style, as she taught herself to write. Letissier named her act Christine and the Queens in tribute to her saviors, an act that also highlights her knack for self-mythologizing. At the end of <i>Christine and the Queens</i>, there is a second arrival, ""Here"", a work of unbroken tension hooked around disintegrating, crackling beats and an organ's glow. She sings, in French, ""I evolve in living trace.""</p>
<p>The production of <i>Christine and the Queens</i> follows that mystical sense of becoming. Most of the songs are built from tapestries of microbeats that have an organic, sinewy feel, unfolding with the intricate flow of a centipede's spine. She often forms strong rhythms from a surprisingly delicate percussive backbone—""No Harm Is Done"" has a feather-light, trap-indebted beat that sounds as though it was sampled from recordings of magnesium fizzling across water. Tiny shifts in impact or intensity can have a massive effect: The simple beat that hardens halfway through ""Tilted"" adds a new level of confidence to Letissier's tale of a wonky but thriving relationship. It's a constellation of experience, the sense of a body being animated, twitching and jerking into existence. Letissier literally espouses the power of movement on ""Safe and Holy"", but the heavy beat and synth-scapes drown out the effect that flows naturally elsewhere.</p>
<p>Letissier's melodic sensibility is as strong as her subtle percussion. ""Paradis Perdus"" is the work of a real pop scholar, an interpolation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5e5Oxc7S3M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christophe's 1973 song ""Les Paradis Perdus""</a> and the chorus of Kanye West's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co0tTeuUVhU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heartless""</a> that unites their common sense of loss over soft piano and a knocking beat. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17734-christine-and-the-queens-jonathan-ft-perfume-genius/"">""Jonathan""</a>, Letissier's duet with Perfume Genius, confronts a lover whose internalized shame means that their relationship is only acknowledged by night. It's a song of immense grace, the funereal pace guided by exquisite synths and expanding strings. ""Can you walk with me in the daylight?"" Letissier asks, her head held high.</p>
<p><i>Christine and the Queens</i> is a beautiful, important negotiation of these liminal states at a time when the media is quick to bandy about the term ""post-gender"" as if the hard work is done. Her music is bold and fully formed, but Letissier unpeels the façade of outer confidence to shine a light on the way that queer identity requires constant negotiation, to deal with the world's often unforgiving gaze and the one that can come from within—on ""Safe and Holy"", she admits that her own eyes ""mock and judge"" her. It's empowering, bold, and vulnerable, and made for dancing. <i>Chaleur Humaine</i> translates as ""human warmth"", and the album makes good on that intimacy. You get the sense of Letissier guarding her own precious, burgeoning fire, and inviting listeners to share in its glow.</p></div>"|21147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21147-christine-and-the-queens/|8.0|Laura Snapes

As such, Gahan's voice has only grown stronger over the years—deeper, more controlled, and more iconic. During this time, that voice has mostly been employed in the service of someone else's songs, that person being Depeche Mode co-conspirator and the band's primary songwriter Martin Gore. It only makes sense that at some point—namely, around the time of 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2285-playing-the-angel/""><i>Playing the Angel</i></a>—that Gahan would want a more active role. Outside of the band, he would eventually release two solo albums—2003's <i>Paper Monsters</i> and 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10827-hourglass/""><i>Hourglass</i></a>—and two collaborations with Soulsavers (aka British producer Rich Machin).</p>
<p><i>Angels &amp; Ghosts</i> is Gahan's second full-length album with Soulsavers. Much like 2012's <i>The Light the Dead See</i>, the record offers an opportunity for Gahan to stretch his legs creatively and shake off some of the baggage that a band with a 35-year history like Depeche Mode invariably has to carry around. In doing so, Gahan and co. largely abandon heavy electronics in favor of something resembling blues rock and gospel-infused Americana, complete with churchy backup singers and quietly shaken tambourines.</p>
<p>The album opens with ""Shine""—a kind of stomping, slide-guitar heavy slow burner in which Gahan imbues a ridiculous line like ""when you look around, it's so profound, what we can do"" with a kind of gravitas that only someone with his particular pipes can pull off, but it still feels like a lightweight version of Depeche Mode's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPhbT73ZG2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Feel You""</a>. ""You Owe Me"" could be a distant cousin to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D3Nl1GZzuw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris Isaak's ""Wicked Game""</a>—all midnight hues and romantic yearning—while ""One Thing"" is the kind of piano-driven ballad that you could <i>almost</i> imagine popping up on a Depeche Mode record. ""Just lay down next to me,"" Gahan sings, ""We can watch those tasteless shows on our TV."" It's the kind of 'no one understands us and it's us against the world forever' track that Gahan has made a career out of perfectly articulating, but in the end the entire thing gets punched in the face by a chorus lyric so hackneyed that one wonder how on earth it actually made it onto the record: ""You just need one thing/ Love.""</p>
<p>As a frontman, Gahan is a marvel of preening and grandstanding, which means that he actually shines on tracks that aren't afraid to get all messianic and pump up the melodrama. In that sense, the album's lead track, ""All of This and Nothing"" (despite also famously being the title of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19331-psychedelic-furs/"">Psychedelic Furs</a> song and album) is perfect for him. The song is populated by black waters, heavy storms, and ghosts that hover continuously outside of windows, which means it's classic territory for Gahan. ""I'm all of this and nothing/ I'm the dirt beneath your feet/ I'm the sun that rises while you're sleeping/ I'm all you need"" he sings, sounding for the first time like the kind of equally doomed and exalted kind of character that he embodies so well. If there's something decidedly lacking on <i>Angels &amp; Ghosts</i>, it's more of his famously gothy bravado. Gahan clearly has a predilection for casting himself as the tortured sinner (""One hand in my pocket/ One foot in the grave/ Standing here, waiting to be saved""), but the nine tracks here—packed full of twangy guitars and tastefully deployed string sections—reach for a kind of holy redemption that they don't ever actually earn.</p>
<p><i>Angels &amp; Ghosts</i> isn't a bad record, but it's frustratingly tepid. Superfans will still find pleasure in hearing Gahan's voice tear through these songs. But at this point, a truly radical departure—or even some kind of insanely catastrophic creative failure—would be more interesting than another selection of songs half-heartedly playing around with tired blues and gospel motifs. One certainly can't fault Gahan for needing his own private creative outlet, but at this point just writing more flatly on-the-nose songs about sin and faith and redemption doesn't sound refreshing or the least bit fun, but instead like something you've already heard him tackle a million times already.</p></div>"|21119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21119-angels-ghosts/|5.7|T.

His early work found an uneasy midpoint between violence and grace: On 2013's <i>Sun Showers</i> EP, misty synths crept on cat feet, surrounded by jabbing, staccato rhythms. This year's <i>Baptizm </i>EP, his first for <a href=""http://tri-anglerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tri Angle</a>, amped up both his tendencies in equal measure, but on <i>Communion</i> the truce has broken, and all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Communion </i>is definitely not grime, even with the genre's telltale signifiers—bruised 808 kicks, broken-glass and gun-cock samples, lurching 140-BPM tempos. It's definitely not industrial, either, though it draws inspiration from the queasy frequencies of acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a>. It is violent music, and even though part of living in the 21st century entails being desensitized to all kinds of mediated awfulness, <i>Communion </i>feels genuinely unsettling: You emerge even after just a few minutes' worth of the album's unrelenting barrage of beats and palette of sampled shrapnel feeling dazed and punch-drunk. Needless to say, it is also thrilling, even when it leaves a sick pit in your stomach.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The sullen melodies are studiously minor key, and with the exception of the occasional desolate spoken-word fragment (""The flesh covers the bone""; ""There aren't any people"") there are no vocals, just yelps of distress. In ""Fetal"", the listener swings to and fro as though lashed to a pendulum above a riot, between machine-gun rhythms and gibbering voices and a whinnying horse. These juxtapositions offer their own kind of enjoyment, but he's not afraid to fight against pleasure, either: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17654-rabit-pandemic/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">""Pandemic""</a> is plodding and heavy-footed, and its climactic machine-gun volley is so intense that it is no fun, but you suspect that's the point.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's not all brutal, exactly. The opening ""Advent"" features a sad synth melody reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">the Cure</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL_nrQxU-wE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Forest""</a>, and ""Artemis"" toys with tentative vocal samples reminiscent of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VIqA3i2zQw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""O Superman""</a>. ""Burnerz"" and ""Black Gates"" feel almost like traditional grime tunes, with their concussive kicks and synth stabs, and ""Trapped in This Body"" might be deconstructed drum'n'bass, with pitched-down sirens and beaten-up tech-step framed by radiophonic bleeps. These are welcome respites; if the album has a drawback, it's that the grim consistency of its palette and techniques leads many songs to blur together in your memory. Still, I'm guessing that is by design. <i>Communion </i>plays out like a kind of fever dream, a delirium of cold sweat and disturbing visions in which there are only brief moments of daylight before you're plunged back into the maelstrom once more.</p></div>"|21081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21081-communion/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

Their reverb-laden dream-pop calls to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/186-azure-ray/"">Azure Ray</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"">Galaxie 500</a>, and it conceals an antsy yearning. ""You'd hide out for hours, dreaming of other rooms to lie in,"" lead singer Leslie Bear sings on ""Dream"".</p>
<p>When Bear asks questions in her songs, as she often does, her inquiries seem more directed to the silence of her brain than to someone in front of her. ""If I ask politely, will you ask me the question of: who do you love?"" she sings on ""Porch"", repeating her question again and again. If there is a drama played out on <i>Sleepwalker</i>, it’s the sort being played out to a mirror, or a diary, or to a love interest’s face imagined in the ceiling above one’s bed.</p>
<p>Sometimes the album meanders, shuffling around noncommittally before finding its footing. ""Turkeys"", ""Dream"", and ""Morning Ghost"" sound nearly made up on the spot, with their minimalist set-up of noodling electric guitars and pitter-patter percussion not quite synchronized. And on ""Moths"", Bear’s voice is obscured by scratchy, layered guitar and the watery echoes of her own already-breathy vocals.</p>
<p>They sound like a band not trying to find their voice, but to project the one they have with confidence. Bear's voice is a literal manifestation of that hesitance: She’ll draw out words until they’re so high-pitched and thin that they seem to evaporate into the rest of the track mid-song, becoming hard to decipher. ""Alone in the dark, is it more alone, than alone in the light,"" she sings on ""Hates the Party"", every word spoken firmly as if they exist alone on the page, until ""light,"" heightened in her sing-song and suddenly like another instrument.</p>
<p><i>Sleepwalker</i> is a very cozy record, full of porch-sitting, moth-watching, sunset-watching. It even ends with a warped rendition of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"". Bear said in <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/music/call-me-long-beard"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a> that she ended up writing most of these songs ""very late when everyone else was asleep,"" which is exactly when you should be listening to this album. <i>Sleepwalker </i>doesn’t quite feel polished, or take many risks, but Long Beard is good at making the music that sounds best played in a lit bedroom, late at night, on a suburban street when everyone else is snoozing in their beds.</p></div>"|21206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21206-sleepwalker/|6.6|Hazel Cills

Though this town is 500 miles southeast of Seattle, almost an eight-hour drive, that's not so far in this part of the country. You have your car, and everything is spread out, and you're always ready to cover ground when you need to. So despite the distance Boise could conceivably be considered part of the Pacific Northwest, if you stretch the definition a little bit, and the music scene there, such as it is, has some connections to its larger neighboring cities. There's a Boise band called Built to Spill led by Doug Martsch, who used to be in an indie rock band based in Seattle called Treepeople.</p>
<p>Two of the stories in the Pacific Northwest rock scene in the '80s and early '90s are the ramshackle D.I.Y. scene surrounding K Records and of course grunge, which by this time had gone so far overground it was on its way to becoming a cliché. Martsch's songwriting has some parallels with the wide-eyed and playful perspective of indie pop, but his twee impulses are tempered by his epic guitar work, which is not connected to grunge proper but can be traced to one of the scene's influences, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"">J Mascis</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> Having made one album, 1993's <i>Ultimate Alternative Wavers</i>, Built to Spill return to Seattle to record their follow-up, <i>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</i>, the record that would change everything for the band. ""That was the last record when I was able to make music without thinking a lot of people would hear it,"" Martsch told <i><a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=bGjsvmNt8UgC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=%22doug+martsch%22+songwriting+%22makes+a+difference%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uXUEdOQsV9&amp;sig=x4__Kd5sqeMOrg4JR10TIp0RwcM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMI6qDW_aLTyAIVgzc-Ch14fQtO#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SPIN</a></i> in 1999. ""It makes a difference. I'd like to think it doesn't matter, but it does.""</p>
<p>That relative anonymity, free from the nebulous expectations of what eventually became a sizable fan base, gave Martsch license to write his most personal album. <i>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</i>, newly reissued on vinyl after being out of print on the format for almost two decades, has come to define a certain strand of indie rock, leaving a cluster of threads picked up by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"">Death Cab for Cutie</a>, and many more. But beyond its influence, it captures a truly original songwriting voice at the exact moment he realized what he had to offer. It's the album as snow globe, a small place where interconnected stories happen and you can get a different perspective on them depending on your vantage point. Built to Spill had some great records ahead of them, but they would never make another album with this level of intimacy.</p>
<p><i>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</i> finds Martsch on the cusp of true adulthood (his first child was born around the time it was made, and his feelings around that are documented on ""Cleo""), but the past is close enough where he sees it with tremendous clarity. The songs highlight the tiny feelings and sensations that have no obvious consequences in the moment but somehow stay with you in every detail. And Martsch has a special talent for pinpointing the tossed-off moments that others might connect to. As a kid, I was excited to learn about the constellations— where they were supposed to be, how the dots were connected, the mythology they represented—but I quickly realized the only one I could make out was the Big Dipper. I spent 20-something years with that meaningless thought pinging in my head, and then I heard a song on this album that started with the words ""When I was little someone pointed out to me/ Some constellations but the Big Dipper's all I could see"" (""Big Dipper"") and suddenly this stray private thought became a shared experience, one wrapped inside an ultra-catchy power pop song.</p>
<p>Nuggets like this, borne of Martsch's keen sense of introspection and emotional generosity, are the lifeblood of <i>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</i>. On ""In the Morning"" he explores the difficulty of enjoying the present moment when filled with anxiety about the future (""Today is flat beneath the weight of the next day, next day, next day, next day"") and how instinct takes over in moments of uncertainty. All the album's hyper-specific lyrical details—and there are many—check out. ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Up_(game)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seven Up</a> I touched her thumb, she knew it was me"" (from ""Twin Falls"") might sound impossibly precious from another songwriter, but Martsch always leavens his sweetness with self-aware humor. ""My stepfather looks just like David Bowie/ But he hates David Bowie,"" goes a line in ""Distopian Dream Girl"", certainly the first time in pop music history that this particular thought has been expressed. Then he follows with ""I think Bowie's cool/ I think <i>Lodger</i> rules, my stepdad's a fool,"" showing just how in touch Martsch is with the feelings of adolescence, those years when you're floating through life, a bundle of nerves, and nothing quite makes sense.</p>
<p>The music and arrangements on the album are every bit the match of the subject matter. Built to Spill showed only hints of the explosive rock machine they'd later become. Acoustic guitar features heavily, a cello saws away in the background, serving as a sort of Greek chorus tracking the emotional arc of a given song's characters. Once in a while, Martsch hits the stomp box and unleashes a noisy solo, the distortion dusting his effortless melodicism with longing. There's plenty of open space, and his voice is much cleaner than it would be later. The sequencing and editing is brilliant, from ""In the Morning""'s split-second pause after Martsch yells ""Stop!"" to the pause between ""Twin Falls"" and ""Some"" that makes them seem like one long song. It's a sound that is simultaneously tiny and huge, a keepsake tucked into a pocket that could at any moment magically become the size of a billboard.</p>
<p>With its focus on childhood, the nature of existence, and the search for meaning, it's possible to hear <i>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</i> in the terms of ""What if there was another universe in my fingernail?""-style stoner dorm-room philosophy. But Martsch's open heart keeps you on his side. There's real beauty in the fumbling exploration he describes in ""Car"", a song filled with lines that crystallize what it's like to be an excited-but-frightened kid learning about life in fits and starts: ""You'll get the chance to take the world apart/ And figure out how it works."" Listening to this album in 2014, another line in the song, ""I want to see it when you get stoned on a cloudy breezy desert afternoon,"" kept bringing me back to the final scene in Richard Linklater's film <i>Boyhood</i>, when the main character we've watched grow through the years takes mushrooms and hikes through a canyon in West Texas, a landscape not unlike parts of Idaho. It reminded me that one reason young people do drugs is because they offer a second chance to see things for the first time. To borrow one last line from ""Car"", on this album Martsch remembered when he wanted to see ""movies of his dreams."" For the vast majority of us that wish is never fulfilled, but <i>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</i> is a celebration of the desire itself, the vulnerability that comes with allowing yourself to imagine possibility.</p></div>"|21096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21096-theres-nothing-wrong-with-love/|9.3|Mark Richardson

Their best songs occur in soft focus, the vocals of frontman and sole consistent member Martin Phillipps hushed and controlled, his guitar lines sturdy and gleaming like gold thread. His best melodies arrive as easy a sigh—gliding steadily through the center of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRv-SPe_Bc0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Satin Doll""</a>, spinning through <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC8bXg0nI_Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tied Up in Chain""</a> between tumbling piano. Where their contemporaries in the New Zealand scene of the early '80s capitalized on shambling charm (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">the Clean</a>) or loose, looping jangle-pop (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/616-the-bats/"">the Bats</a>), the Chills were gentler and—especially as their career progressed—more regal, the corners of their songs filled with almost baroque detail. They feel designed to soundtrack some storybook undersea kingdom, sumptuous and mystic.</p>
<p>This is remarkable, considering the group’s history is shot through with turmoil and darkness. Founding drummer Martyn Bull succumbed to leukemia shortly after recording <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc_tSNivCgg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pink Frost""</a>, the haunting meditation on death for which the group is best known. Forever tipped as the breakout band from the Dunedin indie scene, they cycled through as many as 15 different lineups, releasing an endless string of singles and EPs for New Zealand’s storied Flying Nun label, but always seemed to collapse when they were finally hitting their stride. Case in point: they inked a deal with Warner Bros. in 1990 and scored a modest success with the smart and self-aware <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvYihKlgzOg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heavenly Pop Hit""</a> from the utterly immaculate <i>Submarine Bells </i>but they failed to capitalize on the momentum. The intervening years delivered more EPs, compilations, and even a box set of rarities, but nothing like actual forward movement, And then there was the darkness surrounding Phillipps himself: After grappling with immobilizing depression in the late-'90s, he turned to heroin, and contracted hepatitis C after sharing a needle with a fellow user who carried the disease.</p>
<p>So, it’s both a surprise and relief to hear Phillipps in full fighting form on the title track from <i>Silver Bullets</i>, the first Chills full-length in 19 years. The song—and the album that contains it—handily erases everything from 1990 forward and seems to pick up exactly where <i>Submarine Bells</i> left off: guitars wreathed in reverb, organs heaving, Phillipps’ voice, as quietly assured as ever—even if what he’s singing is tinged with militance. ""And if it’s true they kill a heinous vampire/ Charged with magic charm/ If forced to fight your evil empire/ We have the means to harm."" Much of <i>Silver Bullets</i> strikes this kind of oppositional stance, Phillipps positioning himself as a kind of kiwi pop Tom Joad, pushing back against larger forces that threaten to swallow the less-fortunate whole. Often, the political is personal: on the roaring ""I Can’t Help You"", Phillipps grapples with the knowledge that he’s done harm to others, working through his feelings as his guitar and a whistling keyboard turn somersaults in the foreground. On the elegiac ""Underwater Wasteland"", he uses environmental destruction as a metaphor for social Darwinism, describing plesiosaurs and sea serpents with a kind of awestruck wonder. The music that surrounds him is rich and whispering: guitars that spiral like paper streamers in a breeze, drums that seem smothered in feathers. Combining delicate grace with ornate detailing is no easy feat, but on <i>Silver Bullets</i>, Phillipps manages it again and again.</p>
<p>But the album is not without its missteps. Phillipps’ songs are most effective when his enemies are faceless and generalized—it’s better suited to the album’s storybook mystique. The leaden bromide ""America Says Hello"" comes off like a conspiracy theorist’s 3 a.m. Facebook rant. Ditto ""Tomboy"", a song about a girl who’s picked on by her classmates whose graceful melody and good intentions are undone by Phillipps’ numbing repetition of the title. And ""Molten Gold"", a tumbling number about the healing power of love, feels rote compared to the richness that surrounds it.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-f2113662-8fd0-1c59-9ac6-6f2c6ef77c46""><span>The album is best when it’s at its broadest, and it’s never more so than in the expansive, eight-minute ""Pyramids / When the Poor Can Reach the Moon"". It’s the most ambitious song in the group’s entire catalog, and one whose firm grasp of melody and dynamics more than justifies its length. The tension builds for a full five minutes, the rich getting richer and the poor getting smarter, until it arrives at its glorious, sun-drenched conclusion when, instead of violence and chaos, the gates to the mansion are flung open, guitars and pianos sparkle, the oppressed are liberated and, in Phillipps’ words, ""the poor can reach the moon."" The net effect is warm and rousing, speaking to the power of hope in the face of darkness. After three decades of near-misses and dark alleys, Phillipps has finally embraced his role as king of the underdogs. On </span><i>Silver Bullets</i><span>, he fights back the only way he knows how: with beauty.</span></span></p></div>"|21055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21055-silver-bullets/|6.9|J.

Their personel is bulletproof—John Cobbett and Sigrid Sheie hail from San Francisco's prog-power masters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26562-hammers-of-misfortune/"">Hammers of Misfortune</a>, Mike Scheidt is the vocalist and guitar player behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4719-yob/"">YOB</a>, and Aesop Dekker is the black metal punker from Ludicra (where Cobbett also played) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4892-agalloch/"">Agalloch</a>. All four involved have a rare, vital chemistry, and <i>Deeper Than Sky</i> keeps that fire alive while finding more ways to bend traditional metal formulas. This is the bar metal bands have less than two months to clear if they want to unseat them this year.</p>
<p>One of the strongest tracks on their underrated self-titled debut was <a href=""https://profoundlorerecords.bandcamp.com/track/arising"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Arising""</a>, which added a healthy dose of thrash, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14178-thin-lizzy/"">Thin Lizzy</a>, and Rob Halford to VHÖL's alien version of black metal. <i>Sky</i> continues in this direction, with Cobbett focusing on the thrashier end of his playing. On opener ""The Desolate Damned"", he bends a conventional galloping rhythm just enough to render it strange. ""3 AM"" begins with 30 seconds of straightforward thrash, before VHÖL add choral screams and off-kilter soloing: In VHÖL's world, nothing can ever be simple.   </p>
<p>Scheidt is primarily known as a guitarist due to the popularity of YOB, but he continues to stick mostly to vocals here, and it suits the project. He sounds more liberated in VHÖL—there's life to his ""OOGHS!,"" his homages to Tom G. Warrior's signature grunts, and his death-thrash growls. The contrast between his rhythm and lead tones on the title track makes for a trippy thrash experience; VHÖL know how to disorient without obvious weed/space/psych/drugs signifiers. ""Red Chaos"" draws upon underrated Dallas thrashers Rigor Mortis, in particular their late guitarist Mike Scaccia, who also played in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2780-ministry/"">Ministry</a>. Scaccia had an unrelenting rhythm hand that didn't sacrifice detail; Cobbett takes that same approach, creating soloing that isn't layered on so much as it protrudes through the rhythm.</p>
<p><i>Sky</i>'s real gem, though, is ""Paino"", a d-beat piano instrumental. The idea seems gimmicky in the hands of lesser players, but Sheie and Dekker lock in with each other. Like in his other bands, Dekker provides just enough muscle to elevate Sheie while still making her the center of the song. There are big-bottomed rhythms and soloing that climaxes like the volcano George Lynch posed on for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBluR6cLxJ8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dokken's ""Just Got Lucky"" video</a>. Only metal could make this high-minded absurdity work; it's the intersection of straight-faced practice and boundless joy, and it's as much of a metal song as anything run through miles of Marshalls. <span>Leave it to VHÖL to find another dimension to the ever-bountiful combination of hardcore and metal, where the cerebral and the primal stomp heads next to one another.</span></p></div>"|21143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21143-deeper-than-sky/|8.2|Andy O'Connor

This meant that many stateside listeners were introduced to drum'n'bass via Vibert's goofy and furious rollercoaster tracks set to offbeat samples, like John Goodman's howling admonishment from <i>Barton Fink</i>: <a href=""https://youtu.be/-bF6NR6TstU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'LL. SHOW. YOU. THE. LIFE. OF. THE. MIND.""</a></p>
<p>Since then, Vibert has spun off aliases to match his productions, each one slotted to fit a particular genre. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4541-wagon-christ/"">Wagon Christ</a> signified the trippiest trip-hop, Amen Andrews made dizzying jungle, Kerrier District did filter disco. Albums under Vibert's proper name spread even further: <i>Big Soup</i> spanned breakbeat and downtempo, <i>YosepH</i> dipped into acid, while a compilation, <i>Nuggets</i>, found Vibert digging deep into library music.</p>
<p>The lone constant throughout has been Vibert's corny humor, which comes up often on <i>Bizarster</i>, his first album for his peer Mike Paradinas' <a href=""http://www.planet.mu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Planet Mu</a> label in six years. ""Knockout"" flashes the tricky, skittering footwork of Paradinas and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>, with left-field harp runs, analog synth bloops, and the requisite cheeky vocal sample (this one from Mike Tyson's Nintendo game ""Punch Out!!""). ""L Tronic"" uses the neon nightcrawler squiggle from Stone's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewup5i31Zao"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Girl I Like the Way That You Move""</a>, some more 8-bit bubbles, and an old hip-hop freestyle atop it.</p>
<p>It's a formula that Vibert has done to death no matter the moniker: infectious drum programming, off-center synth melodies, and/or arcade game FX as the next layer, all topped off by vocal snippets from old records or old VHS movies. There's a soul sample, a railing preacher, and a howl to go with the crisp hi-hats and handclaps of ""Officer's Club"", a boast about ""[makin'] like the ghetto [to] blast ya"" sped up so as to move from menacing to cartoonish. Vocal lolz reach peak Vibert on ""I Can Phil It"", built from—as the punny title soon bears out—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6496-phil-collins/"">Phil Collins</a> asking ""can you feel it?"" soon joined by the MC shout from the live version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFuujExs03A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Fingers' ""Can You Feel It?""</a>, and all manner of ""feels"", piled up on a track that ultimately doesn't feel like much.</p>
<p>In 2012, Vibert unearthed more of his Plug material, releasing it as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16184-back-on-time/""><i>Back on Time</i></a>. Much like <i>Bizarster</i>, it's fun enough, but there's little to suggest it might not have been put to DAT in the late-'90s and dusted off nearly 20 years on, even though those jokey samples no longer land quite right. Strip the clever vocal snippets away from Vibert's productions and you're left with those choice drums and goofy melodies, but there's little beyond that to mind.</p></div>"|21196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21196-bizarster/|6.4|Andy Beta

For most of his career, Jeck has used the record and the record player as both primary inspiration and chief instrument. He processes the static sounds archived on forgotten LPs, sampling and obfuscating the source material until it yields and blurs into new pieces. Though he uses little but effects pedals and processors to transmogrify the music, it can seem at times that Jeck physically warps the grooves themselves, turning concentric circles into <a href=""https://images.rapgenius.com/4097144a4aed86218eb312afc11db738.500x333x1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Catherine wheels</a> or <a href=""http://static8.depositphotos.com/1319441/1022/v/950/depositphotos_10220229-Seamless-elegant-paisley-pattern.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">paisley vectors</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure-eight_knot_(mathematics)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interconnected figure eights</a>. If hip-hop’s architects sampled aging sounds to create their own modern world, Jeck uses many of the same tools to create an alternate, individual one that he then invites you to enter.</p>
<p>Jeck had been at this for decades when, 13 years ago, he seemed to find an enviable stride. Released between 2002 and 2008, a triptych of records—<i>Stoke</i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4227-7/"">7</a>, </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12052-sand/""><i>Sand</i></a>—turned his tests into solo turntable symphonies, fully formed compositions meant to be inhabited and<i> </i>analyzed. Jeck merged the audio <i>on</i> the records with the essence <i>of</i> the records, creating new music that popped and cracked beneath the charm of vinyl antiquity. The process seemed to break linear time by giving a universe of lost voices and performances new life at once. You, the listener, went away with Jeck and his record-store finds for a pleasant spell.</p>
<p>But on <i>Cardinal</i>, Jeck’s first new album in five years, that motion and those feelings have calcified a bit. The edges of his sources and samples have hardened, as though he’s confronting the harsh exigencies of the moment rather than escaping to the drift and peace of fantasy. The voices and instruments Jeck once built around slink into the background here, ceding instead to an unexpectedly discomfiting vision. Brittle dins and soft tones, beautiful drones and static shocks participate in a theater of revolving reality and intentional violence.</p>
<p>Jeck indeed created <i>Cardinal</i> with turntables, a technique best heard here through the fractured loop that anchors ""Broke Up"" or the sunbaked wobble that defines ""The Station View"". These 13 tracks, however, often feel powered more by their accessories—""Casio keyboards, Ibanez bass guitar, Sony MiniDisc players, Ibanez and Zoom effects pedals, assorted percussion, a Behringer mixer,"" <a href=""http://www.forcedexposure.com/Catalog/jeck-philip-cardinal-2lp/TO.098LP.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he lists</a>—than the source records. There are jarring moments, as during the menacing ""Brief"" or the lurid ""Called In"", that suggest Jeck has suddenly slammed his palm against a distortion pedal, like some much younger noise lord gunning for the set’s climax. During ""Saint Pancras"", he seems to shake sleigh bells in the distance; pitted against the neon whirr of his electronics, the addition is strangely disconcerting, like a threat voiced from the lips of a longtime ally.</p>
<p>That is the prevailing sentiment of <i>Cardinal</i>, an album where Jeck’s general sense of wonder slips toward dystopian bewilderment. The move makes for a more fragmented listen than expected from Jeck, whose albums are typically immersive and enchanting. Still, the transition comes with unlikely rewards. Rendered in short spans that overlap until they form casual rhythms, the hovering bass and shredded treble of the terrific, terrifying ""…bends the knee 1"" recall the successes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-haxan-cloak/"">the Haxan Cloak</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17732-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2-excavation/""><i>Excavation</i></a>. During ""Barrow in Furness (open thy hand wide)"", Jeck slowly mutates a simple carousel melody until it becomes a dense web of ghastly oscillations, a little like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"">Prurient</a>’s electro phase. Yes, those are surprising references for a British sexagenarian with highbrow bona fides, but again, Jeck’s music has always recast the established world in a singular image. Does it come as any mystery that, now more than ever, he would conjure a setting as or more odious than our own?        </p>
<p>Records are now in vogue in ways they’ve never been during Jeck's career. For decades, he repurposed a medium that seemed bound for obsolescence. At times, his use of the LP felt like a moral imperative, a valiant attempt to spin voices and ideas and forms that might be lost. But records, of course, have become such desirable commodities that it’s now difficult to have them made due to an overburdened market that once seemed destined for dismantling. It’s fitting, then, that this is one of the least turntable-centric albums of Jeck’s career, rendered so that you <i>may</i> be able to hear it all without guessing at the signal path at all. Rather than try to stake some here-first claim with vinyl or turn his past with it into new cachet or credibility, Jeck has used the turntable as a platform for exploring larger sounds and asking bigger questions. <i>Cardinal </i>is a break in his once clear direction, and it’s not his most cohesive album. But it is a logical and necessary leap for Jeck, who has always turned at oblique angles so as to reorder the sounds around him.</p></div>"|21183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21183-cardinal/|7.6|Grayson Haver Currin

The singer/guitarist's New Jersey band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a> have spent the last six years elevating effortless indie pop into a deeply moving art form, and his fellow group members have routinely worked in side projects—bassist Alex Bleeker with his woolly'n'rootsy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28113-alex-bleecker-the-freaks/"">Freaks</a> outfit, and guitarist Matt Mondanile with the watery dreamscapes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27801-ducktails/"">Ducktails</a>. But Courtney's debut solo outing arrives with his own name pushed to the fore. And yet, <i>Many Moons</i> is hardly the work of a narcissistic singer/songwriter. (""I just couldn't come up with a band name,"" <a href=""http://www.spin.com/2015/10/real-estate-martin-courtney-many-moons-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">he recently shrugged</span></a>.) Instead, the charmingly low-key album is an act of humility and, beyond that, quiet grace.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Courtney's voice, like his name, is front and center here, markedly stripped of Real Estate's signature reverb. And rather than relying on his familiar turn-of-the-millennium indie rock touchstones, the singer inhabits winsome, lightly orchestrated '60s psych pop and '70s power pop (documented in a nicely complementary <a href=""http://martincourtneyiv.tumblr.com/post/130205014340/listen-to-martins-new-spotify-playlist-many"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">playlist</span></a>). The album gains shape thanks to an enviably accomplished band that includes Real Estate keyboardist Matt Kallman, like-minded Jerseyite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28059-julian-lynch/"">Julian Lynch</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"">Woods</a>' Jarvis Taveniere, who produced. Plus, for a set that casually began as a stress-relief outlet ahead of Real Estate's 2014 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19060-real-estate-atlas/""><i>Atlas</i></a>, <i>Many Moons</i> works as a remarkably cohesive <i>album</i>, meandering its way across themes of past and present to a state of aching clarity that's modest, but no less genuine for it. Once heard quasi-chanting about suburban suds, Courtney is now the lawnchair-Zen dad.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The album’s title phrase occurs first amid a hodgepodge of images on the lushly jangling ""Vestiges"": ""Many moons for it to grow/ Phases they will come and they will go."" These are the musings of an artist often associated with nostalgia accepting the truism that what we really have left from yesterday is the same ol' never-ending flux. It's a concept he darts around on the equally fine ""Foto"", which finds Courtney reflecting on an old passport photo: ""The past is just a dream."" While a line like that could seem nursery-rhyme commonplace on its own, it builds force nestled amid tracks like ""Awake"", a gentle apology for strumming next door that offers its own ruminations on the past, and ""Asleep"", a backwards-effects reverie that's somewhere between an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlfeyeMFiYA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">""Oh Yoko!""</span></a> dream and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MMDugt8ZRk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">""I'm Only Sleeping""</span></a>. The terrain may be narrow, but Courtney finds subtleties to explore in his quest for a wisdom that will keep growing in meaning as months and trend cycles pass.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Many Moons</i> isn’t all painstaking philosophy on the inevitability of change. A more immediate highlight is ""Northern Highway"", which cruises along, suitably upbeat, as it balances existential questions (""Do you feel just like a stranger?"") with the narrator's avowal that he could never retire to a place without seasons—all via a chiming arrangement befitting the Left Banke. Or ""Little Blue"", a windows-down listen about windows-down listens that’s named after Courtney’s old car. By contrast, on ""Focus"", when Courtney implores, as if giving Magic Eye advice, ""The trick really is not to try,"" it's a bit too on the nose; besides, he already put it better on Real Estate's 2011 sophomore LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15918-days/""><i>Days</i></a>, singing, ""Our careless lifestyle, it was not so unwise.""

You could see glimpses of this direction from his beginnings as one half of the duo Ty &amp; Kory, but it wasn’t until he went solo that he developed the persona that made him a star. </span>He has the skill to make his woozy, grainy songs about parties and women seem so effortless that sometimes it looks like he’s not even trying, which is evident on his latest tape, <i>Airplane Mode</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Airplane Mode</i><span> feels designed as an afterthought, a placeholder to keep Ty’s buzz afloat until his major label debut, </span><i>Free TC,</i><span> arrives. Yet it’s cohesive and engaging even when multiple songs cut out in the middle of verses. This is a purposely unfinished project, one that doesn’t reveal much about Ty that we don’t already know: ""</span><span>I’m a pop a molly, pop a percocet, sippin' Actavis/ My momma mad at me, told me I spend too much money/ I’ve been buying bottles like sure, what, you only live once,"" </span><span>he raps on ""Do Thangs"". He’s still caught up in a tidal wave of women, drugs, money, and never-ending parties. ""</span>Back in the City"" and ""Money Ruin Friendships"" are satisfying records that showcase both Ty’s charming singing voice and his gift for making a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a> beat feel fresh again.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But songs like ""No Fake Shit"" and ""All"" are more intriguing, because they hint at a larger ""there"" with Ty Dolla $ign. ""No Fake Shit"" is a deeply caring love song and ""All"" hints at the trappings and boredom of fame. More importantly, the latter ends with a voicemail from his brother TC, who is currently serving a life sentence. The brief moment gives the EP a hint of soul and signals that Ty might have something more to say to us.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Airplane Mode</i> isn't quite that place, though. There are two references to the EP title<i> </i>here, both telling: ""These days gotta keep my phone on airplane mode/ To dodge these hoes,"" Ty croons on the title track. The second comes from TC’s message from jail. In it, TC he acknowledges that Ty’s phone probably went straight to voicemail because it’s on airplane mode, as if this is a common occurrence. Airplane mode is the setting you put your electrical device in to completely disconnect it from the network. You can’t get text messages, phone calls, or access any apps needing the Internet and, at the risk of sounding precious, it is a bit of a metaphor for Ty Dolla $ign the persona. Disconnected from the outside world, yet still functioning in it, he’s garnered a steady buzz and made plenty of great songs by projecting a disaffected cool.</p></div>"|21224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21224-airplane-mode/|6.8|Israel Daramola

The Leicester-born, London-based producer who makes music as Rival Consoles <a href=""https://twitter.com/rivalconsoles/status/637767636311519232"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a> in protest of the ongoing boom of deep house, asking artists to quit contributing to the genre, currently in vogue. ""There's probably enough to last us till 2089,"" he wrote.</p>
<p>West's ire makes sense, if only because the music he makes as Rival Consoles feels diametrically opposed to the luxuriant, lengthy bath evoked by deep house. West is a musical engineer in the mold of luminaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> and relative newcomers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32294-dave-harrington/"">Dave Harrington</a>, and the soundscapes he's constructed on his third LP, <i>Howl,</i> are spiky and imposing, too solid to sink into. The music is always shifting, so it's impossible to lose track of time while listening. You're always aware that any given composition is morphing, is in flux. Reams of electronic producers luxuriate in the safety of creating a comfortable atmosphere. But <i>Howl</i> is impossible to ignore, and hard to forget.</p>
<p>That's partly because West so often feels comfortable disrupting his own patterns. ""Afterglow"" seems as if it's going to build on an early synth loop, but what at first seems like the track's foundation turns out to be its foyer: halfway in, and suddenly we're in an entirely new room, one that's louder, brighter, more expansive. Our understanding of his pieces broadens as they move through time, so that once they're nearly over we apprehend the entire structure as if by a drone camera hovering above.</p>
<p>That vivid view is studded with allusions: the title track makes extraordinary reference to trains and tunnels, and at times the dusky track ""Pre"" recalls the snaking sounds of a film projector. West has <a href=""https://www.xlr8r.com/features/2015/10/qa-rival-consoles/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> that he's a fan of ""sloppy things and rough things happening in music,"" but even the little blips and isotopes here feel as if they've been cast in concrete, accidents granted purpose. In contrast to the last two Rival Consoles LPs, <i>Howl </i>was largely forged from hardware (as opposed to digital technology), and the record's analogue origins would be obvious even if you knew nothing about its genesis.</p>
<p>West is a labelmate of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28863-nils-frahm/"">Nils Frahm</a> and, this year alone, has toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4987-clark/"">Clark</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27935-nosaj-thing/"">Nosaj Thing</a>. He shares with all three the instincts of a classical composer<i>.</i> <i>Howl</i>'s closer, ""Looming"", is a six-and-a-half-minute mini-epic that reflects the depth of emotion that West says he poured into <i>Howl</i>. But the catharsis it induces comes as much from the musician's restraint and sense of composure as anything else. What isn't there is as important as what is.</p>
<p>West's grumbling about deep house might make him seem like a dinosaur. But he doesn't seem bothered by its <i>existence</i>; he's complaining about a surplus, and, like a true progressive, his momentary gripe stands as mere prelude to more concerted action. His music—rocky, spiky, warm, titanic—drives us to re-evaluate whether referring to someone as a dinosaur might not be quite as pejorative as we thought.</p></div>"|21222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21222-howl/|7.7|Jonah Bromwich

On earlier records the band, organized around multi-instrumentalist </span><span>Jørgen Munkeby, </span><span>were more elusive, but </span><i>Blackjazz</i><span> was an album made entirely of jagged shapes, like the irregular, violent architecture of a cliffside. I<span>t feels aggressively assembled, as if its ideas of metal and jazz were less harmonized than magnetized together.</span> </span>The follow-up, 2013’s<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18099-shining-one-one-one/"">One One One</a></i>, reduced them into an atomically unstable industrial rock band. While thrilling, the album could have the remoteness of a formal exercise.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>International Blackjazz Society</i> sounds like a compression of these two approaches, but it evolves into something distinct as you listen. Unlike <i>One One One</i>, the songs here don’t simply accelerate until they expire. There’s more space in the arrangements, and the songs expand into the room they’re afforded. Some of this shift can be credited to new drummer Tobias Ørnes Andersen, who plays industrial music with more patience and tension than previous drummer and founding Shining member Torstein Lofthus. ""Thousand Eyes"" feels like stoner metal, of all things; the riff is a little more drunk than the band usually allows. ""House of Warship"" is free jazz, which is actually new territory for Shining; even their freest moments on previous records seemed premeditated, a kind of organized collapse. Whenever Munkeby plays saxophone on <i>International Blackjazz Society</i> the songs sound as if they’re sprouting fractals.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-5510f6fb-80af-05cf-8d04-c77bf27fa564"">Still, even as the band relaxes into new atmospheres there’s an extreme, ascetic discipline on display. The architecture of their music is modernist, a series of inelastic and inorganic shapes colliding with the velocity of a distant level of ""Tetris"". On <i>International Blackjazz Society</i>’s final track, ""Need"", you can feel this refined performance begin to rupture. It’s as unhinged as it is straightforward; as it acquires mass in the choruses it seems to list off the ground into some new, uncertain gravity. <span>For all the blur and motion of their music, this hint of deeper chaos might be the album's most exciting moment.</span></span></p></div>"|21106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21106-international-blackjazz-society/|7.0|Brad Nelson

The results of that meeting only came to light in the past few years (it's fully documented on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60476-harmonia-announce-complete-works-vinyl-box-set/"">forthcoming Harmonia box set</a>) but the meeting sprang to my mind while listening to Karamika.</p>
<p>Karamika is a duo of British musician George Thompson (who does numerous remixes as <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/black-merlin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Merlin</a>), and Gordon Pohl, who's one half of Düsseldorf act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31842-musiccargo/"">Musiccargo</a>. At times, their work together evokes the chilly sounds of early-'80s minimal wave and some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a>'s analog synth soundtracks. But the snaking, immersive 12 tracks that comprise their debut often brings to mind the primitive, visceral early electronic music that Cluster themselves made back when they were still known as the woolly, circuit-bending band Kluster.</p>
<p>Karamika's music is reactive in that sense, pulling away from the use of readily available software and computers to revisit an era when these electrical surges weren't so easily tamed and manageable. ""Ton 01"" begins with a slowly undulating sine wave and throb, and when the metronomic drumming enters it brings to mind Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter's first forays as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>. As the track moves along, a noisy guitar appears, reminiscent of the one that worms through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAXYMOgHQI4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hallogallo""</a>, showing where early electronics grappled with rock instrumentation, each pushing the other into strange new realms.</p>
<p>There's nothing especially novel about emulating the likes of Cluster, Kraftwerk, or Neu! in 2015 (nor would it have been back in 2005), but it's hard to get the parameters right. The exploratory spirit remains intact, but Karamika's resultant tracks feel more focused and they are judicious in adding new layers and noises to the initial framework so that it doesn't all collapse under the weight. More often than not, the deeper you travel into the pieces, the more mesmerizing they become.</p>
<p>A sense of claustrophobia and dread lurks beneath the surface throughout. As ""Ton 04"" moves through its nine minutes, the throbs gather in density until they feel like a migraine. The cavernous clattering on ""Ton 07"" begins as an early experimental piece might. Disembodied voices appear on the album highlight ""Ton 9"", and at the peak of tension a child's laugh comes in, which has a horror-film effect, prickling the skin rather than breaking the tension. In that way, Karamika's homage to their German forefathers forgoes the utopian spirit of some of those albums. Instead, Thompson and Pohl hint at the isolating, disconnected present. </p></div>"|21211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21211-karamika/|7.3|Andy Beta

While an endless procession of angular <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a> imitators came and went, !!! carved out a space for themselves as disco true believers, foregoing the calculated dourness of the '80s for the joyous excesses of the decade prior. Few of their peers were releasing epic singles that stretched for almost 10 minutes (2003's now-classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqQYetCH8U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story)""</a>), or essentially trolling fans with something as simple as their name (""It's pronounced 'Chk chk chk',"" ""Actually, it's any three monosyllabic sounds in rapid succession,"" etc.). And no other group had a frontman as gleefully irreverent as Nic Offer, who is not opposed to busting out a dutty whine onstage in board shorts and a midriff-baring T-shirt. Making the uncool cool became second nature for !!!, yet another quality that separated them from the pack. </p>
<p>But !!! have repeatedly suffered from bad timing—they're unable to distance themselves from that one, fairly brief moment midway through their career where they found themselves part of something bigger, and that lens distorts the way their music in received. <i>As If</i>, !!!'s sixth studio album, is very much a reaction to that crisis of identity, a mostly successful attempt at re-establishing themselves as the premier suppliers of fun, kinetic, sprawling indie disco.</p>
<p>!!!'s secret weapon has always been their sense of humor—from their beginnings in the late '90s, when Offer basically had the wardrobe of an off-duty American Gladiator, to the tongue-in-cheek career highlight <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrajuEyRLxs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pardon My Freedom""</a> from their politically-charged second LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1764-louden-up-now/""><i>Louden Up Now</i></a>, whose chorus of ""Like I give a fuck about that motherfuckin' shit"" serves as a mini manifesto for !!!'s entire ethos.</p>
<p>There's nothing quite as special as ""Pardon My Freedom"" on <i>As If</i>, but opening track ""All U Writers"" delivers the album's first chuckle amidst it's pounding dance beat: ""I knew I shouldn't have kissed him in a Chevrolet,"" sings a plaintive female voice, as Offer's distorted and stuttering vocals provide the song's structure. There's immediately a sense that !!! aren't necessarily trying to recreate past greatness but are pushing their sound and style in a new direction. The clearest example of this—and subsequently the best, if strangest, track on the album—is ""Every Little Bit Counts"", a straightforward rock-pop party song that would fit snugly on a Haircut 100 record circa 1983. The track has a big, broad, singalong chorus, a fist-pumping drumbeat and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"">Orange Juice</a>-like jumpy guitars, and it's unlike anything !!! have put forth up to date. ""Freedom! '15"" serves as a spiritual sequel of sorts to <i>Louden Up Now</i>: ""Freedom!/ How's that working for you, baby?"" sings Offer and his band of sarcastic backing singers, condensing the last decade of American political apathy into six minutes of funk.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, <i>As</i><i> If  </i>leans a little too heavily on the groove in the middle, with moments like ""Funk (I Got This)"" fading into the background, but it's reinvigorated towards the end by the riveting ""Lucy Mongoosey"", which uses another singalong chorus as an anchor, an introspective pause among all the dancing. The final track, ""I Feel So Free (Citation Needed)"", features Offer's slowed-down, slurred vocals narrating the construction of the song itself: “It's quiet around here without a kick drum” he states, before said drum comes into the mix and transforms it into a heady, weirdo, funny, controlled mess, much like !!! themselves. With a little luck, <i>As If</i> will be the turning point !!! are looking for, the beginning of a new path without the dance-punk baggage they've been toting around for the last decade.</p></div>"|21182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21182-as-if/|6.9|Cameron Cook

Fourteen years ago, Vanessa Carlton made a very popular song that will follow her around forever. Fair enough; it's very catchy. But times have changed. Can't Vanessa? She recently told <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/vanessa-carlton-on-album-liberman-motherhood/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CBS News</a> that she ""learned a lot"" since her debut album, ""which is mostly that you don't know anything."" That's as good a place as any to reset, which she does with the refreshingly raw <i>Liberman</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like the bulk of her recordings, it's still comprised of her honeysuckle voice and piano licks, but <i>Liberman</i> (so named after Carlton's grandfather, one of whose paintings of nudes hangs in her home and served, she says, as a sort of inspiration) either lets those components stand alone or accentuates them with mild indulgences, like blunted brass or hand claps. The bare songwriting is not something you would identify as avant-garde, but Carlton's inclinations are a lot weirder than they used to be. Take the album cover, which with its thick white border and bold black type resembles a <a href=""http://thegentlewoman.co.uk/#/magazine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Gentlewoman</i></a> magazine cover. This isn't quite an album of Swiss design-inspired art jams, but maybe it's her version. The single ""Operator"" has Carlton using the huskiness of her voice to sound threatening in a way that makes you wonder what a truly severe Vanessa Carlton album might sound like.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, <i>Liberman</i> is excellent on its own. Carlton's voice is the key attraction on songs that register between low-key pop, rock, and folk. Early single ""Blue Pool"", for example, touches on each in a way that feels refreshingly old school, as though pop radio these days was comprised of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"">Fleetwood Mac</a> and the Mamas and the Papas.<b> </b>The song's latter third is given over entirely to arpeggiating keyboard runs in a way you don't notice at first, because it's so atmospheric and catchy. But it's also odd—is this a sketch of a song? An extended outro? What is it doing here?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album is pockmarked with quirky decisions like this and it's better for it. Were <i>Liberman</i> the creation of a heretofore-unknown artist, it's difficult to imagine an album of such earnestness generating the kind of pre-release interest that would deem it worthy of CBS News. But that's the pickle of early success. The flipside is that it's also harder to imagine fans of punkier singer-songwriters like <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"">Angel Olsen</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32424-tobias-jesso-jr/"">Tobias Jesso Jr.</a> embracing her. She should share a stage with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"">Perfume Genius</a>. They both have beautiful voices and something to say.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For Carlton, that message is a simple, almost sisterly, ""You <i>got</i> this."" ""That's the way it is, love,"" she sings on ""House of Seven Swords"", breaking the fourth wall with some mild real talk. This is the person I want to hear tell me ""shit happens""; the confidence in her voice is very reassuring. Perhaps that is the source of some of Carlton's magic, that she herself is delivering the shaman's prayer she sings about on album opener ""Take It Easy"". ""When heaven wraps around you/ And she will/ Take it easy"". Don't mind if I do.</p></div>"|21173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21173-liberman/|7.8|Matthew Schnipper

They were teenage girls, dressed up in bows and baby doll dresses, singing flirty songs about love and adolescence penned typically by adult male songwriters. France Gall <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoMv1njA1GA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sang of swallowing ""lollipops""</a>, Chantal Kelly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML0N_B8MyA8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sang of telling an older lover</a> she’s only 15, Clothilde was forced to sing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEOHGG3O7eY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bloody fables</a>. When the songs weren’t sexually charged jokes, they were melodramatic pop ballads about youth, from Chantal Goya’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc3hnJjUd68"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unpredictable heartache</a> to Sylvie Vartan’s simple <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAMPPdBsnt4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dance-driven desires</a>.</p>
<p>And then there was Françoise Hardy. She wasn’t quite a black sheep of the genre, but she certainly complicated the formula. The Parisian singer auditioned for Vogue Records at 18 and went on to top charts with her very first release, a 1962 self-titled record now known as <b><i>Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles</i></b> based on its hit song. From there, the infamously timid Hardy became one of the few French pop stars of the era to cross over, jetting from England to France to record, serving as a muse to designers like Yves Saint Laurent, and inspiring Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger.</p>
<p>That debut<i> </i>showcases Hardy at her simplest, wringing rockabilly-tinged pop magic from modest jazz percussion and steel guitar. Hardy wrote most of her own material, setting her far apart from her peers, and on her debut she penned every song but two. Her lyrics would never hew this close to yé-yé traditions again: See the ""whoa-oh-oh"" echoing on tracks like ""Il Est Tout Pour Moi"" and her cover of Bobby Lee Trammell’s ""Oh Oh Chéri"". The title track ""Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles"" remains an iconic vision of Hardy's aesthetic: frank music for romantic wallflowers. ""They walk in love without fear of tomorrow,"" she sings in French of the young couples she watches on the street. ""Yes but me, I’m single with a tormented soul, yes but me, I’m single because nobody loves me.""</p>
<p>The five albums that make up Hardy’s reissues are really compilations of four-track, seven-inch singles. Because of this, some of these records feel disjointed, a side effect from compiling songs that weren’t initially made to sit next to each other. Such is the case for her next three records, <b><i>Le</i> <i>Premiere Bonheur Du Jour</i></b>, <b><i>Mon Amie La Rose</i></b>, and <b><i>L’Amitié</i></b>. Still, each has a different story to tell about Hardy’s musical influences at the time. <i>Le Premier Bonheur Du Jour</i> pulls from American girl groups, echoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8548-the-crystals/"">the Crystals</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6894-the-ronettes/"">the Ronettes</a> on ""L’Amour D’Un Garçon"", ""Nous Tous"", and ""On Dit De Lui"". Elsewhere, the record boasts electric organ arrangements on snappy jazz-inspired tracks like ""L’Amour Ne Dure Pas Toujours"" and ""Comment Tant D’Autres"".</p>
<p>On <b><i>Mon Amie La Rose</i></b> she explores a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Morricone</a> influence that was inchoate on <i>Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles</i>. ""Mon Amie La Rose"", based on the poem by Cecile Caulker and Jacques Lacome, and ""La Nuit Est Sur La Ville"" are terrifically spooky and cinematic, the latter depicting Hardy wrestling with cheating with a man on a lonely dark night. Elsewhere, she dips her toes in plucky Western country-rock on ""Pas Gentille"" and ""Tu Ne Dis Rien"". But with <i>L’Amitié</i> she zigzags between all these references: She’s the cowgirl guitar-heroine on her cover of ""Non Ce N’est Pas Un Rêve"", a dreamy wall-of-sound pop charmer on ""Le Temps De Souvenirs"", and folk singer on ""L’Amitié"".</p>
<p>No matter her inspiration, Hardy’s music is bound together by her point of view, which is part of what makes her fascinating. Her songwriting is profoundly lonely, frequently insecure. Observers have emphasized Hardy’s anti-social nature as a celebrity, but you can hear it even in her music. Like all introverts, she seems most alone when surrounded by others, her insecurities ricocheting off those around her. On <i>Tous Les Garçon Et Les Filles</i>' ""La Fille Avec Toi"" she reaches out to an ex only to see him with another girl, bemoaning how beautiful she is. ""I dream of losing myself, if only I can lose myself with you,"" she sings on <i>L’Amitié</i>’s ""Tu Peux Bien"". On <i>Mon Amie La Rose</i>’s underrated star track ""Tu N’As Qu’Un Mot A Dire"", she pines for an old lover, singing the verse in hushed tones like someone hugging the sidelines before rushing desperately to the forefront for the chorus, filled with shrill, swooning violins: ""You just have to say the word and I’ll return,"" she cries, breathing urgency into a word as simple as ""toi.""</p>
<p>It wasn’t until her fifth record <b><i>La Maison Où J'Ai Grandi</i> </b>that Hardy grew into a more grown-up, baroque sound, one that matched the depth of her sorrow and its complexities. It was her most well-produced, well-written record to date, cohesive in sound and subject matter. Over harpsichord and Hardy’s own Spanish guitar, she echoes the previous four albums' worth of lip-quivering romantic longing, reflecting on what it means to lose love once you find it, or when it doesn’t live up to your fantasies. On ""Si C’est Ça"", her whispery voice and hushed guitar playing operate on the same frequency. ""Maybe this is the moment I prefer, the moment, despite it all, where everything could suddenly switch, where life could change at last,"" she sings to a lover who is leaving her on ""Surtout Ne Vous Retournez Pas"". ""So I say nothing."" The girl whose greatest fantasy was once having a hand to hold now wishes to let it go.</p>
<p>What always made Hardy’s music stand out from her yé-yé peers is how it tackled adolescent desire: Hardy was often consumed with romantic extremes. She reveled in chest-clutching longing, but her adorations came from a place entirely her own. Her obsession with love was devoid of older, male sexualization or control, a privilege not many others of her era enjoyed.</p>
<p>Hardy’s songs feel timeless in how they emphasize a universal dream for pure love. Is this music antique in its sound? Surely. In its sentiment? Hardly. Aside from a few anachronisms (""I’m fine with the movies, for rock, the twist and the cha-cha,"" she sings on her first album’s track ""Je Suis D’Accord"") this is '60s pop devoid of vintage signifiers; nobody goes steady, nobody sings of dying an old maid, there is no cutesy, wink-filled posturing. Sometimes, especially in Hardy's choice to cover male singers, her music feels almost devoid of gender. For a genre so tethered to young women of a certain time period, this is a feat.</p>
<p>On <i>Le Premier Bonheur Du Jour</i>’s quick little track ""Le Sais-Tu?"", Hardy finally sings directly to the object of her affections, but she’s forgotten what she yearned to express. She keeps stopping to sing, ""did you know?"" as if stuttering: ""I so dreaded, did you know, this second, which made me think of the end of the world ... One in which you’re there, holding in your hands without maybe even realizing it: my destiny."" There’s a reason her music crossed so many country and language barriers, and it wasn’t just because she looked like a model and hung out with the Rolling Stones. These songs map a sort of adoration that derives its intensity from youth but lingers with us for the rest of our lives. Not many pop stars sing about that these days. To the joy of romantic loners everywhere, Françoise Hardy built her career on it.</p></div>"|21098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21098-tous-les-garcons-et-les-filles-le-premier-bonheur-du-jour-mon-amie-la-rose-lamitie-la-maison-ou-jai-grandi/|8.6|Hazel Cills

<p>And then there was Françoise Hardy. She wasn’t quite a black sheep of the genre, but she certainly complicated the formula. The Parisian singer auditioned for Vogue Records at 18 and went on to top charts with her very first release, a 1962 self-titled record now known as <b><i>Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles</i></b> based on its hit song. From there, the infamously timid Hardy became one of the few French pop stars of the era to cross over, jetting from England to France to record, serving as a muse to designers like Yves Saint Laurent, and inspiring Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger.</p>
<p>That debut<i> </i>showcases Hardy at her simplest, wringing rockabilly-tinged pop magic from modest jazz percussion and steel guitar. Hardy wrote most of her own material, setting her far apart from her peers, and on her debut she penned every song but two. Her lyrics would never hew this close to yé-yé traditions again: See the ""whoa-oh-oh"" echoing on tracks like ""Il Est Tout Pour Moi"" and her cover of Bobby Lee Trammell’s ""Oh Oh Chéri"". The title track ""Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles"" remains an iconic vision of Hardy's aesthetic: frank music for romantic wallflowers. ""They walk in love without fear of tomorrow,"" she sings in French of the young couples she watches on the street. ""Yes but me, I’m single with a tormented soul, yes but me, I’m single because nobody loves me.""</p>
<p>The five albums that make up Hardy’s reissues are really compilations of four-track, seven-inch singles. Because of this, some of these records feel disjointed, a side effect from compiling songs that weren’t initially made to sit next to each other.

On ""Si C’est Ça"", her whispery voice and hushed guitar playing operate on the same frequency. ""Maybe this is the moment I prefer, the moment, despite it all, where everything could suddenly switch, where life could change at last,"" she sings to a lover who is leaving her on ""Surtout Ne Vous Retournez Pas"". ""So I say nothing."" The girl whose greatest fantasy was once having a hand to hold now wishes to let it go.</p>
<p>What always made Hardy’s music stand out from her yé-yé peers is how it tackled adolescent desire: Hardy was often consumed with romantic extremes. She reveled in chest-clutching longing, but her adorations came from a place entirely her own. Her obsession with love was devoid of older, male sexualization or control, a privilege not many others of her era enjoyed.</p>
<p>Hardy’s songs feel timeless in how they emphasize a universal dream for pure love. Is this music antique in its sound? Surely. In its sentiment? Hardly. Aside from a few anachronisms (""I’m fine with the movies, for rock, the twist and the cha-cha,"" she sings on her first album’s track ""Je Suis D’Accord"") this is '60s pop devoid of vintage signifiers; nobody goes steady, nobody sings of dying an old maid, there is no cutesy, wink-filled posturing. Sometimes, especially in Hardy's choice to cover male singers, her music feels almost devoid of gender. For a genre so tethered to young women of a certain time period, this is a feat.</p>
<p>On <i>Le Premier Bonheur Du Jour</i>’s quick little track ""Le Sais-Tu?"", Hardy finally sings directly to the object of her affections, but she’s forgotten what she yearned to express. She keeps stopping to sing, ""did you know?"" as if stuttering: ""I so dreaded, did you know, this second, which made me think of the end of the world ... One in which you’re there, holding in your hands without maybe even realizing it: my destiny."" There’s a reason her music crossed so many country and language barriers, and it wasn’t just because she looked like a model and hung out with the Rolling Stones. These songs map a sort of adoration that derives its intensity from youth but lingers with us for the rest of our lives. Not many pop stars sing about that these days. To the joy of romantic loners everywhere, Françoise Hardy built her career on it.</p></div>"|21098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21098-tous-les-garcons-et-les-filles-le-premier-bonheur-du-jour-mon-amie-la-rose-lamitie-la-maison-ou-jai-grandi/|8.7|Hazel Cills

They were teenage girls, dressed up in bows and baby doll dresses, singing flirty songs about love and adolescence penned typically by adult male songwriters. France Gall <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoMv1njA1GA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sang of swallowing ""lollipops""</a>, Chantal Kelly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML0N_B8MyA8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sang of telling an older lover</a> she’s only 15, Clothilde was forced to sing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEOHGG3O7eY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bloody fables</a>. When the songs weren’t sexually charged jokes, they were melodramatic pop ballads about youth, from Chantal Goya’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc3hnJjUd68"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unpredictable heartache</a> to Sylvie Vartan’s simple <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAMPPdBsnt4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dance-driven desires</a>.</p>
<p>And then there was Françoise Hardy. She wasn’t quite a black sheep of the genre, but she certainly complicated the formula. The Parisian singer auditioned for Vogue Records at 18 and went on to top charts with her very first release, a 1962 self-titled record now known as <b><i>Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles</i></b> based on its hit song. From there, the infamously timid Hardy became one of the few French pop stars of the era to cross over, jetting from England to France to record, serving as a muse to designers like Yves Saint Laurent, and inspiring Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger.</p>
<p>That debut<i> </i>showcases Hardy at her simplest, wringing rockabilly-tinged pop magic from modest jazz percussion and steel guitar. Hardy wrote most of her own material, setting her far apart from her peers, and on her debut she penned every song but two. Her lyrics would never hew this close to yé-yé traditions again: See the ""whoa-oh-oh"" echoing on tracks like ""Il Est Tout Pour Moi"" and her cover of Bobby Lee Trammell’s ""Oh Oh Chéri"". The title track ""Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles"" remains an iconic vision of Hardy's aesthetic: frank music for romantic wallflowers. ""They walk in love without fear of tomorrow,"" she sings in French of the young couples she watches on the street. ""Yes but me, I’m single with a tormented soul, yes but me, I’m single because nobody loves me.""</p>
<p>The five albums that make up Hardy’s reissues are really compilations of four-track, seven-inch singles. Because of this, some of these records feel disjointed, a side effect from compiling songs that weren’t initially made to sit next to each other. Such is the case for her next three records, <b><i>Le</i> <i>Premiere Bonheur Du Jour</i></b>, <b><i>Mon Amie La Rose</i></b>, and <b><i>L’Amitié</i></b>. Still, each has a different story to tell about Hardy’s musical influences at the time. <i>Le Premier Bonheur Du Jour</i> pulls from American girl groups, echoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8548-the-crystals/"">the Crystals</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6894-the-ronettes/"">the Ronettes</a> on ""L’Amour D’Un Garçon"", ""Nous Tous"", and ""On Dit De Lui"". Elsewhere, the record boasts electric organ arrangements on snappy jazz-inspired tracks like ""L’Amour Ne Dure Pas Toujours"" and ""Comment Tant D’Autres"".</p>
<p>On <b><i>Mon Amie La Rose</i></b> she explores a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Morricone</a> influence that was inchoate on <i>Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles</i>. ""Mon Amie La Rose"", based on the poem by Cecile Caulker and Jacques Lacome, and ""La Nuit Est Sur La Ville"" are terrifically spooky and cinematic, the latter depicting Hardy wrestling with cheating with a man on a lonely dark night. Elsewhere, she dips her toes in plucky Western country-rock on ""Pas Gentille"" and ""Tu Ne Dis Rien"". But with <i>L’Amitié</i> she zigzags between all these references: She’s the cowgirl guitar-heroine on her cover of ""Non Ce N’est Pas Un Rêve"", a dreamy wall-of-sound pop charmer on ""Le Temps De Souvenirs"", and folk singer on ""L’Amitié"".</p>
<p>No matter her inspiration, Hardy’s music is bound together by her point of view, which is part of what makes her fascinating. Her songwriting is profoundly lonely, frequently insecure. Observers have emphasized Hardy’s anti-social nature as a celebrity, but you can hear it even in her music. Like all introverts, she seems most alone when surrounded by others, her insecurities ricocheting off those around her. On <i>Tous Les Garçon Et Les Filles</i>' ""La Fille Avec Toi"" she reaches out to an ex only to see him with another girl, bemoaning how beautiful she is. ""I dream of losing myself, if only I can lose myself with you,"" she sings on <i>L’Amitié</i>’s ""Tu Peux Bien"". On <i>Mon Amie La Rose</i>’s underrated star track ""Tu N’As Qu’Un Mot A Dire"", she pines for an old lover, singing the verse in hushed tones like someone hugging the sidelines before rushing desperately to the forefront for the chorus, filled with shrill, swooning violins: ""You just have to say the word and I’ll return,"" she cries, breathing urgency into a word as simple as ""toi.""</p>
<p>It wasn’t until her fifth record <b><i>La Maison Où J'Ai Grandi</i> </b>that Hardy grew into a more grown-up, baroque sound, one that matched the depth of her sorrow and its complexities. It was her most well-produced, well-written record to date, cohesive in sound and subject matter. Over harpsichord and Hardy’s own Spanish guitar, she echoes the previous four albums' worth of lip-quivering romantic longing, reflecting on what it means to lose love once you find it, or when it doesn’t live up to your fantasies. On ""Si C’est Ça"", her whispery voice and hushed guitar playing operate on the same frequency. ""Maybe this is the moment I prefer, the moment, despite it all, where everything could suddenly switch, where life could change at last,"" she sings to a lover who is leaving her on ""Surtout Ne Vous Retournez Pas"". ""So I say nothing."" The girl whose greatest fantasy was once having a hand to hold now wishes to let it go.</p>

Or are profit-minded artists merely preaching to the sociological choir—</span><span>did you know the hood is fucked up?</span><span>—while affirming and banking off conservative America's worst stereotypes? Certainly it would be difficult to suggest gangster rap tropes are winning a PR war over middle America. But at the same time, the implicit realism of Chicago's street rap scene makes armchair cynicism about its stars' motives impossible: </span><i>Ballin Like I'm Kobe</i><span> is no lazy b-ball double entendre, but a reference to Jacobi D. Herring, a friend of G Herbo's who was killed in 2013, and over whose tombstone he crouches on the tape's cover. Likewise, ""I'm Rollin"", the tape's underground smash single, opens with a roll call of lost friends, and the drug they'd do with Herb if they were here today.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That Southside-produced track comes near the tape's conclusion, and it's the most structurally compelling on the album. This isn't the kind of hit you can force; it just happens. It sounds as if it were hewn from craggy granite, each segment of the song—the beat, the backgrounds, the chorus, Herb's rapping—grinding into place, sparks flying. It takes up an aggressive amount of space, forcing listeners to open themselves to its heft and rough edges. Formally, the record is his most innovative, one which ambitiously reimagines the rules of songcraft. Thematically, it captures the strange dissonances of what's been called drill music, its heightened stakes and tragic context contrasting starkly with its artists' armored detachment.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">No other song on <i>Ballin Like I'm Kobe</i> feels quite so one-of-a-kind. Sometimes it's pro forma; drill records like the DJ L-produced ""Gang"" sound as if they could have been recorded any time within the past three years. But outside of ""I'm Rollin"", Herbo's doesn't traffic in the kind of pioneering stylistic breakthroughs common to the first wave of drill artists—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30015-king-louie/"">King Louie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"">Lil Durk</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a>. He is not drill's most versatile talent, preferring to play to his own strengths. His more traditional approach is an ability to wring narrative pathos from the song without letting his voice's cracked shell fully break. His vocal style is ragged but forceful, and in contrast with the East Coast influences to which it might be readily compared—the LOX, say—there's a sense of Herbo's words scratching past the lines, moving with a looser, less precise rhythm, as if to suggest an anxious undercurrent. And likewise, his subject matter seldom moves toward the humor of classic New York mixtape artists, preferring to shift from the autobiographical to very real-seeming threats.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-a52ffabb-7243-9f48-dae3-354161e426a3""><span>There's a tendency to approach Herb—in contrast with other artists on the scene—as if he were his genre's moral conscience, the Manichean good to drill's unmitigated baseline of evil. This reduces the genre's complexity to a simplistic binary. Herb's strength is less about moralism than it is about showing a complete human being in your speakers—an honest rendering of a morally compromised soul. These are the album's best moments. There is the DJ L-produced ""Eastside"", with scribbled double-time verses and contradictory tones of resignation and pride. It's an approach that works similarly on opener ""L's"": ""The shit I been through made me heartless, all my feelings on this glock."" And it's readily apparent on the melancholy ""Bottom of the Bottom"", which frames the rapper's aggressive approach with a crying string sample, which lends an echoing power to an atypically pointed chorus: ""Now the judge hang us with a hundred years, used to hang us with a tree.""</span></span></p></div>"|21153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21153-ballin-like-im-kobe/|7.2|David Drake

But dig just a little below the surface and there's a lot more going on. At various points Friel evokes noise, industrial, punk crossed with techno, video games, even jazz. On <i>Life</i>, his fourth full-length, he covers that range more thoroughly than ever, which perhaps explains the album's all-encompassing title. Pretty much his entire musical existence is locked in these grooves.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The title might also refer to the fact that Friel has literally created life—this is the first album he's recorded since his son Wolf was born in 2013. Friel's music has always had childlike qualities, but here he makes that connection explicit. He opens with a sweet, woozy jingle called ""Lullaby (For Wolf)"", following later with the even-more sugary ""Theme"", which could pass for an outtake from Raymond Scott's </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soothing_Sounds_for_Baby"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Soothing Sounds for Baby</i><span>.</span></a><span> The warped, off-speed crunch of ""Sleep Deprivation"" would fit on any Friel album, but pinning its title to parenthood reveals how well his music captures the half-awake fog of early child-rearing. </span></p>
<p>The rest of <i>Life</i> may not be about kids, but every track contains some simple melodic nugget that any toddler would happily hum along to. The best songs revel in that anthemic innocence, particularly the catchy ""Cirrus"", an immediate earworm on the level of Friel's 2012 insta-classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14089-valedictorian/"">""Valedictorian""</a>. The two title tracks are nearly as memorable, though a lot more abrasive, ringing with distortion and bullet-like fuzz blasts. </p>
<p>But again, hearing Friel through a single thematic prism is unwise. Some sections in <i>Life</i> sound like hip-hop bathed in nitrogen, or even like lost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10512-the-bomb-squad/"">Bomb Squad</a> beats. Friel's way of taking his melodies off on tangents evokes jazz solos; his obsession with gritty texture gives some pieces, like the clanging ""Bender"", the <i>musique concrète</i> feel of a busy construction site. And for all its machinistic beats, <i>Life</i> can also sound like a sloppy punk band rattling basement walls. That's especially true during ""Jamie (Luvver)"", Friel's wordless cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31621-joanna-gruesome/"">Joanna Gruesome</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFJVdoFLlnM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song</a>, which gives the already-energetic original a huge shot of late-night caffeine.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What unites all the styles in Friel's sonic fryer is playful momentum. His main instrument, a Yamaha Portasound keyboard, is literally a toy, and throughout </span><i>Life </i><span>it sounds like he's rolling around on the floor. Most of his songs include a constant whirr, and leave you with the echo of that eternal buzz—an effect that I imagine is a mirror of Friel's bleeping brain. Give </span><i>Life </i><span>some time and you might find it infecting your synapses, too.</span></p></div>"|21174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21174-life/|7.8|Marc Masters

One has to assume <i>Nothing Feels Good</i> graces the cover of Andy Greenwald’s genre exegesis, subtitled ""Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo"", partially because of its title: Greenwald takes us to the LiveJournal era and beyond, so ""nothing feels good"" speaks both to the performative oversharing and theatrical sadness most have associated with emo as well as the self-deprecation and guilt that is assumed of its fans. But even after 18 years, there’s no way anyone can listen to the Promise Ring’s landmark second LP and feel as if it’s an endorsement or <i>cause</i> of anhedonia; it’s one of the most effective cures.</p>
<p>The world of <i>Nothing Feels Good</i> doesn't pinpoint specific, identifiable emotions. It is a state of being, one where an overactive mind and overstimulated body aren’t exactly at war, but struggling to attain common ground. It’s feeling like your heart is pumping Mountain Dew straight to your brain and your central nervous system can’t be trusted. Davey von Bohlen himself is at a loss for words to describe it: many of <i>Nothing Feels Good</i>’s inscrutable, quotable lyrics are a result of internal miscommunication: ""I got my hands on the one hand, and I don’t know where to put them"", ""I married a room, where I’ll at least keep my hands in order"", ""how do I explain your body to the rest of my day?""</p>
<p>The Promise Ring were in their very early twenties in 1997, when <i>Nothing Feels Good</i> was released. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-839b7641-81b9-059b-8e61-865be4c4453e""><span>They retained the urgency and velocity of their rawer, punkier debut </span><i>30° Everywhere </i><span>(also being reissued)</span><span>,</span><span> matching it to the nervous energy of an entire freshman dorm at a midwestern public university on a Friday night. The Promise Ring can barely contain themselves here, their biggest difference from von Bohlen's previous band </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/677-capn-jazz/""><span>Cap’n Jazz</span></a><span>, who didn't even try. </span></span>This touch of restraint amidst chaos makes the Promise Ring a quintessential emo band, and it's the rhythm section that sets them apart from proper <i>indie rock</i>. Compare <i>Nothing Feels Good</i> to the predominant bands of the era—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo"">Yo La Tengo</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"">Built to Spill</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement"">Pavement</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian"">Belle and Sebastian</a> weren’t exactly known for their exuberance, earnest embrace of pop or crisp musicianship, and while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3829-sleater-kinney"">Sleater-Kinney</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi"">Fugazi</a> were the only two bands with tighter rhythm sections, their concerns were<i> far</i> different than those of the Promise Ring. This was ""college rock"" but with a different set of reference points: Imagine if Fugazi’s ""Do You Like Me?"" were written from the mindset of ""Call Me Maybe"".</p>
<p>And so when skeptics conflate the Promise Ring with more pop-punk oriented peers like Saves the Day or the Get Up Kids, drummer Dan Didier and bassist Scott Beschta (sorely missed on subsequent LPs) are the best counterargument. ""<span id=""docs-internal-guid-839b7641-81bb-4abb-589c-f107849362e0""><span>Is This Thing On?"" starts </span><i>Nothing Feels Good</i><span> in a full sprint and from that point forward, Didier rarely repeats himself for more than four bars, filling every moment with syncopations, triplet fills, or double-time cymbal crashes. </span><span>Beschta likewise forgoes indie's preferred thumbing of simple root notes, treating bass as an active melodic and rhythmic participant. It’s not music you can really </span><i>dance</i><span> to, but it encourages extroversion and restless giddiness just the same.</span></span></p>
<p>The sheer likability of <i>Nothing Feels Good</i> may result in its slightly underrated status—it lacks the mythic aura of Cap’n Jazz, isn’t granted the same hushed reverence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/341-sunny-day-real-estate-diary/""><i>Diary</i></a>, nor is it as currently influential as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19352-american-football-american-football/""><i>American Football</i></a>, passionately defended as <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19688-mineral-the-power-of-failingendserenading"">The Power of Failing</a>,</i> or as expansive and progressive as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarity_(Jimmy_Eat_World_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Clarity</i></a>. But it's still subtly innovative—the unconventional song structures showed emo could become pop without verses and choruses, while their open-C tunings lent a warm beauty to even the friskiest songs.</p>
<p>More importantly, von Bohlen neutralized early emo's chest-beating with his off-key lisp and playful, poetic language, bridging the abstractions of Tim Kinsella’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2197-joan-of-arc/"">Joan of Arc</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3190-owls"">Owls</a> with Mike Kinsella’s plainspoken mash notes in American Football. Even when ""emotional hardcore"" was presented as an way out of its excessively aggro roots, it was still music meant to be taken very, <i>very</i> seriously—loud and fast and extremely earnest, not entirely concerned with melody, driven by an intense, cloth-rending yearning for spiritual deliverance. The guy at the center of Promise Ring songs is idealistic and well-read, but approachable; we come barrelling into a house party during ""A Broken Tenor"" and all of a sudden, one of the kitchen drinkers is quoting Sylvia Plath’s ""Daddy"". </p>
<p>Von Bohlen’s vocabulary is heavy on geographical and chromatic symbolism—he canvasses the continental United States and likes how his girlfriend looks in red, white and blue (""Red &amp; Blue Jeans""), whereas on ""B Is for Bethlehem"", those colors represent flesh and blood. Conflating place and people names would soon become one of the emo's most tired cliches—the Promise Ring themselves were already guilty of it by <i>Very Emergency</i> (""Jersey Shore,"" ""The Deep South""). Still, <i>Nothing Feels Good</i> is charged with the honest enthusiasm you feel upon discovering how much there is out there beyond your hometown, where every new city and every new person seems impossibly fascinating.</p>
<p>With sensations this intense, the potential for burnout is perilously high. Greenwald’s book views it as a foregone conclusion for emo bands and fans alike, and there’s a lot of evidence backing up this view—nearly all of the genre's legendary bands flamed out spectacularly, made overtly ""mature"" albums that were shunned by fans, or evolved into more sedate, wistful projects (including Von Bohlen’s own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2916-maritime"">Maritime</a>).<span> </span>""I don’t know if anything at all will be alright,"" von Bohlen sings on the title track, likely referring to the pressures of adulthood. But he was unfortunately prophetic: the Promise Ring would suffer a near-fatal van accident in 1999 and tried to put a happy face on things with the Botox’d power pop of <i>Very Emergency</i>. A year later, von Bohlen was suffering from severe migraines before a fist-sized tumor was discovered and removed from his brain, followed by an insertion of a prosthetic plate in his skull to replace an infected fragment. On the subsequent <i>Wood/Water</i>, the Promise Ring signed to <a href=""http://www.anti.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anti-</a>, hired a guy who produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"">Smiths</a> records, and von Bohlen wrote floral, folky songs about settling down, giving up on guitar music, and wishing he never was a singer.</p>

Like many bands to come out of Olympia since the '80s, they understand their place in rock history: their four LPs bear the mark of musicologists who know their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUQiUFZ5RDw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bad Moon Rising""</a> from their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20428-bad-moon-rising/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bad Moon Rising</i></a>, their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDTSUwIZdMk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kool Thing""</a> from their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKQs-MapRlk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""2 Kool 2 B 4-Gotten""</a>, their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb-SVPJM4L4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Some Velvet Morning""</a> from their <a href=""http://www.somevelvetsidewalk.com/about/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Some Velvet Sidewalk</a>. Levitating hooks and an emotional heaviness co-exist in their impressionistic songs, like the light-and-dark glow of a perpetual magic hour. As a singer, Carrie Keith (who also plays guitar) has absorbed as much from Lucinda Williams' pained rasp as from Kim Gordon's spacious monotone. And it's telling that her <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/6fjFvJCv0b/?taken-by=burritoboss69"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">notably crazy-legged</a> fellow guitarist Dylan Sharp once played in a corrosive hardcore band called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvtPrl24L6A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spiritual Warriors</a>, an allusion to the surrealist filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky. The connection underscores the subtle late-capitalist critique in his plainspoken lyrics, a soft-pedalled but deeply felt ideological edge. Gun Outfit are a seemingly modest band who sound alternately chained or freed by their devotion to thinking big-picture, by their gentle insistence on life-or-death stakes.</p>
<p>As ever, they sound like they just wandered off the set of a country Western being shot inside a shipping container, but <i>Dream All Over</i> is Gun Outfit's most consistent record by some margin. With its echoing grooves, drifting landscapes, and new textures—bits of bluegrass banjo, homemade electric sitars—<i>Dream All Over</i> has the blue-sky sensibility of a soul-searching road trip. There's gorgeous outlaw poetry on Keith's imagistic ""Legends of My Own"", a tale of a woman reborn alone in a foreign land. ""When I put my blanket down/ I'm going to dream all over,"" Keith sings; it's an inspired metaphor for the act of becoming, and the cool composure with which she draws out the line ""I wear a mask but not to hide"" is its own kind of empowerment.</p>
<p>That abstract feminism also comes through on the LP's bare, sun-staring centerpiece ""Angelino"". Keith's symbols of ""a kingdom in ruins"" and ""all of the cowgirls on the losing end"" are more graceful ways of saying ""fuck the patriarchy,"" but if you listen close to them they bite. <i>Dream All Over</i>'s incantatory folk-rock cushions pleas for the systematically oppressed, meditations on apathy, poverty, greed, slavery, death. In the survivalist's love song ""In Orbit"", Sharp sings ""You and I/ Are not the only satellites/ Circling an uninhabitable void/ For our whole lives."" At least they are together.</p>
<p>Gun Outfit's music has gotten slower with each release, an inversion of (or response to) how human life has evolved since their band formed nine years ago. They reject the pace of our times, where<a href=""https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks/status/218439593240956928"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> everything happens so much</a>. When they <i>do</i> evoke the modern world—like the 3D-printed gun that appears in the lyrics to closer ""Only Ever Over""—there is an ominous, no-future edge to it. They seem to acknowledge the planet is doomed, while drawing a strange relief from facing facts. ""Oh world, what lesson do you teach?"" Sharp sings on the poignant ripper ""Worldly Way"". ""Console yourself with sadness/ Befriend your misery."" It made me think of <a href=""http://www.vice.com/read/what-you-call-depression-i-call-the-truth-309"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an essay</a> by the poet Melissa Broder, in which she explores the idea that depression is the over-evolution of the mind.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Perhaps this is why Gun Outfit—a band that will validate your pain as much as it will comfort you—still has such a fervent cult following underground. Punks love Gun Outfit because punks are inherently a little shattered. It's easy to carry a heavy heart when you live in a state of constant confrontation, when ""anxiety's your default,"" as Sharp tosses off on the relatively upbeat <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17601-gun-outfit-gotta-wanna/"">""Gotta Wanna""</a>. Gun Outfit understands what it is to feel unsettled, to need some calming. On ""Only Ever Over"", after making the grand, dour, and quietly hilarious assertion that rock'n'roll and literature are dead, Sharp sings: ""Cup a little coal/ Try to make it glow/ We're going to have a fire before we go.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">In a recent <a href=""http://www.fvckthemedia.com/issue57/hard-coming-down"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, Sharp gave one of the best definitions of punk that you're likely to hear this year—that it's broadly ""about being humble and resisting the illusion that everything's fine."" In this framework, Gun Outfit fit as logically alongside folk tradition as Sonic Youth, to whom they have often been compared. The latter connection seemed truer of 2010's clattering, astounding <i>Possession Sound</i>, which should have made Gun Outfit as popular as contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"">Angel Olsen</a>. The comparison now feels more spiritual, insomuch as Gun Outfit can offer a countercultural compass of restless subterranean artists, filmmakers, bands, labels, philosophies. <i>Dream All Over</i> recalls the most crucial lesson of all underground rock music: become your own sound, and create a universe for it to exist in.</p></div>"|20980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20980-dream-all-over/|8.1|Jenn Pelly

The last Wax Idols record—2013’s sophomore effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18072-wax-idols-discipline-desire/""><i>Discipline + Desire</i></a>—was an exercise in sustained tension informed, at least in part, by her training as a professional dominatrix. As a result, the record played like an extended tease—tantalizing the listener with heavily eyelinered pop stylings but still keeping things at a cool remove, always stopping just shy of delivering the kind of massive hook that could have potentially knocked everyone out of their collective creepers.</p>
<p>In contrast, <i>American Tragic</i> is a much more empathetic affair, fully stocked with songs that bear the trappings of gloomy post-punk and the appropriate gray shades of goth, but wraps them around words that articulate real human feelings. While previous Wax Idols tracks sometimes felt like excuses to show off an aesthetic, <i>Tragic </i>manages to unpack a number of complicated ideas, particularly about how much our personal identities are defined by our relationships. And while it would be easy to attach a personal narrative to songs like ""Goodbye Baby"" and ""Lonely You"" (based on the fact that Fortune reportedly went through an ugly divorce prior to making this record), the album strives to be much more than a classic breakup record. In the end, it’s a record about getting over.</p>
<p>The album opens with ""A Violent Transgression""—a bit of reverby melodrama in which Fortune sets the tone for the record by singing ""This is an absolute negativity/ A sudden, irrevocable plunge"" before ultimately concluding that ""Desire/ It’s violent."" The violence of wanting—both wanting <i>in</i> and ultimately desperately wanting <i>out </i>of a relationship—lies at the heart of <i>American Tragic</i>. The most compelling tracks are those that deal with the queasy malaise of missing something you know is ultimately bad for you. On the glorious ""Lonely You""—a bit of Anglophilic guitar pop that sounds like some long-lost ""120 Minutes""-worthy single that never was—Fortune pauses to pine for a lover that is better left in the dust. ""It was a sorry gilded cage/ That bound our hearts together,"" she laments, ""Now I just want to push the weight of you away forever."" Elsewhere, on ""Goodbye Baby"" the notion of a collapsing romance is both devastating and empowering: ""I’m not wasting time/ I’m taking my heart back/ I’m taking what’s mine.""</p>
<p>If Fortune sounds newly empowered here it’s for good reason. <i>American Tragic</i> is, in every way, a very personal missive. She wrote and recorded everything herself (except the drums, played by Rachel Travers) and the collection unspools like a clever synthesis of dark new wave and late-'80s post-punk without ever sounding too much like an obvious pastiche of either. ""At Any Moment"" approaches <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30673-sky-ferreira/"">Sky Ferreira</a> levels of mainstream pop accessibility, while ""Deborah"" gives a twist on the classic doomed heroine ode (""Had you pegged for a gay boy but you were just a playboy"") and wraps it up in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>-like guitar lines and a sprinkling of drum machine handclaps. On the other hand, ""Severely Yours"", with its references to sexual power dynamics and submission (""You can be the Marquis tonight""), is a little too on the nose for someone who has already mined this kind of territory so thoroughly in the past (and there should be a moratorium on non-ironic references to crucifixion and martyrdom for any kind of goth-approved record that isn’t actually <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14890-pretty-hate-machine/""><i>Pretty Hate Machine</i></a>).</p>
<p>Mostly though,<i> Tragic</i> avoids living up to its namesake by sidestepping cliché and never overstaying its welcome. At a relatively brief nine tracks, the record is a perfectly paced blast of dark pop that deftly reflects Fortune’s growing prowess as a songwriter—here offering everything from slow burn dirges on romantic grief to perfectly executed synth jams about emotional freedom. As a result, it’s not a surprise that she increasingly draws comparisons to women like Chrissie Hynde and Siouxsie Sioux—powerful forces who knew how to strike a perfect balance between authority and vulnerability. By opening up and shedding some of her icy veneer on <i>American Tragic</i>, Fortune places herself in very good company.</p></div>"|20859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20859-american-tragic/|7.6|T.

Carpenter himself will tell you how accidental that status is: He only began composing and recording the scores to his films—starting with his first one, 1974’s <a href=""www.imdb.com/title/tt0069945/""><i>Dark Star</i></a>—in order to avoid having to pay someone else to do it. His use of electronic instruments, even his signature minimalist style—all of it sprang from budgetary concerns. </p>
<p>But Carpenter’s scores—specifically the ones for <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077651/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Halloween</a> </i>and <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080749/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Fog</a>—</i>developed a cult following among synth geeks, and this burgeoning fan base has inspired him to try his hand at making music without a movie to compose it for. Encouraged by his musician son and his discovery of modern digital recording software, he released his first solo album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20091-john-carpenter-lost-themes/""><i>Lost Themes</i></a>, earlier this year. Although the tracks are smoothed out by bland Logic plugins, it was a pretty decent evocation of his soundtrack work.</p>
<p>If <i>Lost Themes</i> provided an opportunity to reflect on Carpenter’s influence on several generations of electronic musicians, the selection of remixes by other artists tacked on as bonus tracks makes that influence explicit. Now, <a href=""http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones</a> has fleshed out the set out with a couple more tracks and <i>Lost Themes Remixed</i> stands as a companion volume to the original record.</p>
<p>Remix albums are tricky things, and the ones that fail (and most of them do) do so for the same few reasons: too many stylistically disparate remixers, too much reverence for the the source material, remixers who are clearly in it for the easy paycheck. <i>Lost Themes Remixed</i> avoids all three. Carpenter’s status seems to have inspired the nine remixers to bring their A game, and Sacred Bones selected committed experimentalists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"">Prurient</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"">Zola Jesus</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29644-blanck-mass/"">Blanck Mass</a> (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5684-fuck-buttons/"">Fuck Buttons</a>’ Benjamin John Power) who wouldn’t play too nice with Carpenter’s recordings.</p>
<p>Stylistically, pretty much any artist who’s going to want to remix John Carpenter is going to have a few things in common, including a pervasive gloominess and an affection for throbbing, single-note bass lines played on analog synthesizers. As a result, <i>LTR</i> manages to hold together as a unified stylistic statement in a way that isn’t common for remix collections.</p>
<p>Despite the project’s singular focus, <i>LTR</i> doesn’t just reflect Carpenter’s influence on contemporary musicians, but the range of artists that he’s inspired. Prurient transforms Carpenter’s New Age-leaning ""Purgatory"" into a harsh, icy soundscape. The Blanck Mass reworking of ""Fallen"" sounds like slasher-movie music from some grimy, glitched-up cyberpunk future. Zola Jesus and Dean Hurley reconfigure <i>Lost Themes</i>’ most classically Carpenteresque track ""Night"" into vocal house for vampires.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some of the remixers seem to be correcting <i>Lost Themes</i>’ deviations from Carpenter’s signature formula. In its original form, ""Abyss"" highlights both Carpenter’s knack for building complex arrangements out of deceptively simple parts and his weakness for really corny synth patches. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1527-foetus/"">Foetus</a> mastermind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8748-jg-thirlwell/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">J.G. Thirlwell</a> swaps them out for the kind of assaultive analog sounds that set the tense mood of Carpenter’s early films (and which themselves were considered corny at the time). One one hand there’s something offensive about the idea of somebody trying to fix an artist’s new work by making it sound more like his old stuff. On the other hand, I have to admit I like the remix more.</p></div>"|21126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21126-lost-themes-remixed/|6.9|Miles Raymer

This is especially apparent when artists outside of Scandinavia adopt hallmark signifiers like facepaint, illegible band logos that look like cobwebs, Satanism, ratty production values, and a harsh, staticky brand of guitar distortion that sounds like static. Not unlike the way rappers across the globe aspire to a constellation of mannerisms that first coalesced in the Bronx, today's black metal artists, regardless of where they're from, mold themselves after an attitude that blossomed within a distinctly Nordic headspace during the genre's early-'90s Second Wave.</p>
<p>Still, it comes as something of a surprise that Austin Lunn of the U.S.-based solo act Panopticon harbors such an open fascination with vague, mythical notions of ""the North."" His last album was titled <a href=""https://thetruepanopticon.bandcamp.com/album/roads-to-the-north"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Roads to the North</i></a>, this new album <i>Autumn Eternal</i> includes a track titled ""Into the North Woods"", and several Panopticon releases feature wintry, foreboding landscapes as cover art that will immediately strike a chord with aficionados. But the ""North"" that Lunn invokes is actually his adoptive home of Minnesota. And, though the multi-instrumentalist has made a personal principle out of staying reclusive, his isolation shouldn't be mistaken for the misanthropic fury that has driven black metal's most notorious antiheroes.</p>
<p>As <i>Autumn Eternal</i>, Panopticon's seventh full-length, again makes clear, Lunn is an artist capable of appropriating core aesthetics from a number of genres while simultaneously honoring them—a balance that requires no small measure of dexterity. Lunn's manifesto-like notes on <a href=""https://thetruepanopticon.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> betray a sensitive heart that he wears on his sleeve. Clearly, Panopticon's music isn't motivated by hate or nihilism, and one can easily imagine a Henry David Thoreau-like figure retreating to the woods to contemplate personal, spiritual, and environmental concerns while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>'s Justin Vernon nurses his love wounds in the cabin next door. More importantly, Lunn's work lacks the creepy jingoism that some of his Nordic peers have embraced on the slippery slope to Nazi/white supremacist sympathies. The bands that have flirted with ugly racial undertones have, of course, enjoyed the twin benefits of titillating fans and repulsing detractors, cultivating an aura of danger while hiding safely behind suggestion.</p>
<p>Lunn has no need for such coyness because his heart is in an entirely different place. To be fair, it's not like you can understand what he's singing about. And whether or not his intentions truly give this music a more humanistic vibe than other black metal fare is debatable. But his musical agility certainly does set Panopticon apart, <i>Autumn Eternal</i> in particular. As he has in the past, Lunn infuses atmospheric black metal and European melodic/symphonic death metal with prog rock, post rock and, perhaps most audaciously, bluegrass. On paper, those combinations reek of calculation, but Lunn has long proven his ability to blend them into a seamless, irony-free sound, a sound he continues to forge ahead with on <i>Autumn Eternal</i>. Black metal bands have been paying homage to Viking folk tradition for years now, but the results have often been laughable. When Lunn incorporates acoustic roots expressions from the hills of Kentucky, it comes off neither as an academic exercise nor as an attempt to parody his overseas counterparts.</p>
<p>In fact, there's no denying the earnestness of <i>Autumn Eternal</i> opener ""Tamarack's Gold Returns"", which prominently features violin work by Johan Becker of Chicago's <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/austarasband"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Austaras</a> alongside Lunn's own dobro playing. Where artists following the metal playbook would have fashioned the tune as a one-minute intro, Lunn and Becker go on for a full three minutes-plus before the music gives way to a minutes' worth of a found-sound ambient recording of Lunn spending time in nature. After that, a hail of ornate, baroque-style metal kicks in with lead guitars wailing dramatically over double bass drum rolls before Lunn makes his vocal entrance. Piercing but also bottom-heavy, Lunn's voice emanates brute animal power. He also allows for long instrumental sections where he refrains from singing, which only highlights its impact when he starts to howl.</p>
<p><i>Autumn Eternal</i> concludes the trilogy that Lunn started with 2012's <a href=""https://thetruepanopticon.bandcamp.com/album/kentucky"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Kentucky</i></a> and continued with <i>Roads to the North</i>. Listeners who have followed Panopticon since that point or before will no doubt quibble over whether he's gone too far—or maybe not far enough—with the stylistic variety this time. Other than the myriad twists and turns on the epic ""Sleep to the Sound of the Waves Crashing"", Lunn generally approaches the new material as if he's streamlining his approach rather than going for more audacious or pointed ways to combine his influences. During one of the blast-beat sections on ""Waves Crashing"", the mix suddenly strips down to the point where it feels like you're listening to the drums from inside the unflattering acoustics of a rehearsal space while the guitarist tests a new reverb pedal from the adjacent room. Becker's violin on the song switches gears from a rustic Scottish/Irish vibe to film score melodrama. ""Pale Ghosts"", meanwhile, finds a space for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2816-mono/"">Mono</a>-esque shoegaze within the DNA of furious black metal riffing before the song takes flight into a dreamy passage anchored by a melancholic guitar arpeggio.</p>
<p>Lunn has a way of making these and other elements sound perfectly at home with one another. In truth, nothing on <i>Autumn Eternal</i> jumps out as incongruous, which suggests that Lunn is simply expanding—not trying to radically alter—the black metal formula. Still, by renouncing its obligatory celebration of malice, Panopticon gives the form a much-needed makeover, and with <i>Autumn Eternal</i>, Austin Lunn further uncovers musical potential that's long been overshadowed by too much bad-boy posturing.</p></div>"|21200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21200-autumn-eternal/|7.5|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

The singer/songwriter recently explained to <i><a href=""http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/exclusive-joanna-newsom-discusses-new-album-with-uncut-70813"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Uncut</a> </i>that her marriage in 2013 had invited death into her life, ""because there is someone you can't bear to lose,"" she said. ""When it registers as true, it's like a little shade of grief comes in when love is its most real version. Then it contains death inside of it, and then that death contains love inside of it."" There is only one domestic vignette on the record, towards the end of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17693-joanna-newsom-leaving-the-city/"">""Leaving the City""</a>, where Newsom and her love go running on a beautiful day. Immediately, though, her high dims: ""The spirit bends beneath knowing it must end."" 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13960-have-one-on-me/""><i>Have One on Me</i></a> traced the death of a relationship as Newsom tried and failed to defeat a proud man's human nature. On <i>Divers</i>, she attempts to defeat time to stave off death.</p>
<p>To bear the weight of its subject, <i>Divers</i> fits to scale, ornate and roaming after the intimacies of <i>Have One on Me</i>. The arrangements—tackled by Newsom along with eight different musicians, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"">Nico Muhly</a>, Ryan Francesconi, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a>' David Longstreth, and her brother Pete—<span>cover the ground of all her past work in a fraction of the time, making this her most dynamic and exhilarating album.</span> The first half in particular veers between baroque poise, jaunty blues, and rococo beauty, as if searching for answers in disparate places. Landlocked between the dry, acoustic arrangements of ""The Things I Say"" and ""Same Old Man"", the lilting harp and piano of the title track casts her lover as a deep sea diver and measures the distance between them, ""how the infinite divides."" The meticulous internal rhymes in the chorus of ""Leaving the City"" contract against the tug of her harp, a cascade of tiny parts that form a huge, billowing whole, like tiny bones in a vast wingspan. ""The longer you live, the higher the rent,"" she sings inside the frenzy.</p>
<p><i>Divers</i> makes a landscape out of this abstract fear of loss. On the courtly ""Anecdotes"" and ""Waltz of the 101st Lightborne"", she is part of a battle fought by birds to try and wrest control of time. ""You Will Not Take My Heart Alive"" is the most Ren Fair piece here, on which Newsom contemplates ascension to some transcendent plane, ""[severing] all strings to everyone and everything."" Its sister song ""A Pin-Light Bent"" descends sadly back towards reason and reconciliation of her unsuccessful quest to outrun time. ""In our lives is a common sense/ That relies on the common fence/ That divides and attends,"" she sings with palpable mourning, accepting that her life, ""until the time is spent, is a pin-light, bent."" Where this kind of cosmic existentialism could come off like a stoner marveling at the moon, Newsom pulls it off with balance of poetry and reason. Her fantastical world is sometimes hard to get your head around, but it brings surreal, sometimes sci-fi delight to a record that's otherwise often lyrically despairing.</p>
<p>Where Newsom's second and third records each overhauled what came before, <i>Divers</i> is a refinement that draws on elements of each of its predecessors. The shapes of her records often get misinterpreted as concepts themselves, rather than the sign of a writer attuned to her work's needs. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9616-ys/""><i>Ys</i></a> from 2006 was the five-song suite; <i>Have One on Me</i> from 2010, the three-disc opus. On its surface <i>Divers</i> is more conventional, a single disc where nine of its 11 songs are under six minutes long, but it also happens to be a wild, genuine concept album. The final song, ""Time, As a Symptom"", ends with Newsom in raptures, commanding white stars, birds, and ships to ""transcend!"" On the very last burst, she clips the word to ""trans—"". The first word on opener ""Anecdotes"" is ""sending."" It is a perfect loop.</p>
<p>Most artists on their fourth album settle into atrophy, or at least comfort, Newsom delivers such complex, nuanced music, filled with arcane constructions, that she is only her own yardstick. (In a recent interview about <i>Divers</i>, David Longstreth <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-ca-ms-joanna-newsom-20151018-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cited</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5893-the-milk-eyed-mender/""><i>The Milk-Eyed Mender</i></a> as one of the reasons he quit college: ""[What] am I doing here if someone is already out there making music like this, on this level?"") Her consummate craft is a given; what surprises every time is her ceaselessly renewing sensitivity for life's vicissitudes and the fantastic ways she finds to express them. <i>D</i><i>ivers </i>is not a puzzle to crack, but a dialog that generously articulates the intimate chasm of loss, the way it's both irrational and very real. Nothing will stem the fear of a loved one's death, which western culture does little to prepare us for until the very end, but by pulling at the prospect of mortality from every angle, Newsom emerges straighter-spined, and invites you to stand alongside her. </p></div>"|21097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21097-divers/|8.5|Laura Snapes

The French producer was a pioneer of flashy outdoor events—laser harps, pyrotechnics, crowds of a million or more, and budgets running into the millions, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70GVZD9Cgd0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">set in places like the Great Pyramids of Giza</a>. His records sold like hotcakes—his 1976 debut, <i>Oxygène</i>, is said to be France's best-selling album ever—and featured spacy, arpeggio-laced fantasias, halfway between the ""cosmic"" synthesizer music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> and the techno-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>, but they often veered dangerously close to kitsch.</p>
<p>The French musician's last new album was in 2007, but now he returns, borrowing a page from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a>'s playbook, with an album clearly designed to introduce him to a new generation. There are 16 songs on <i>Electronica 1 </i>and 15 collaborators (""Automatic"", a co-production with Yazoo's Vince Clarke, is in two parts), and they run the gamut, from titans like Tangerine Dream and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a> to rising dance-music stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31453-gesaffelstein/"">Gesaffelstein</a>.</p>
<p>Fellow synth maestro <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a> represents the electronic old school along with Anderson and whatever surviving members of Tangerine Dream are now using the name. The classical pianist Lang Lang lends a little high-culture gravitas, and Pete Townshend is here for some reason. Then, on the contemporary side, there's the French synth-pop soundscaper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a>, one of the artists indebted to Jarre's sense of texture and volume, along with the adrenaline-loving techno producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8269-boys-noize/"">Boys Noize</a>, the prog-minded electronic duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5684-fuck-buttons/"">Fuck Buttons</a>, and the electro-pop singer and musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26824-little-boots/"">Little Boots</a>.</p>
<p>But this diversity presents our first problem. Because unless you approach <i>Electronica 1</i> as a collection of unrelated songs designed to be cherry-picked for playlists—and given the generic title, maybe that's the point—there's little to hold it together. In the first three songs we're taken from buzzing, high-energy techno-pop with Boys Noize, a billowing schaffel number with M83, and a weird New Order-goes-New Age pastiche with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"">Air</a>, and it never gets more coherent than that, unless you count Jarre slathering filters and bright, buzzing synths on everything like so much Cool-Whip as a common denominator.</p>
<p>And that brings us to our second problem: apart from a few songs—the moody ""Automatic"", with Vince Clarke, and maybe the goth-leaning Gesaffelstein track—the music just isn't very good. ""Suns Have Gone"" is an anodyne electro-house bouncer featuring a mopey <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2795-moby/"">Moby</a>. The Tangerine Dream tune features some nice, pinging synths, but there are literally dozens, if not scores, of Tangerine Dream records you'd be advised to reach for first. ""Rely on Me"" saps Laurie Anderson's voice of its arch, critical qualities and turns her into the centerpiece for a sultry downtempo cut you'd expect to find on a Hôtel Costes compilation.</p>
<p>Maybe the song that makes the most sense is the Armin van Buuren collaboration ""Stardust"", and that's because the trance icon is most like Jarre himself in his fondness for whooshing effects, gleaming synths, and big, emotional-button-pushing chord changes. Of all contemporary electronic styles, trance is the only one where Jarre's influence is really felt; it would have made more sense to team him up with a dozen producers from that style, where a real back-and-forth exchange of ideas might have taken place. Instead, <i>Electronica 1</i> is mostly a matter of superimposing one style upon another—sort of like tracing shapes on the pyramids with lasers.</p></div>"|21117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21117-electronica-1-the-time-machine/|4.0|Philip Sherburne

The fruits of her labor are near-uncharacterizable: Bell melds Russian folk melodies with pop, traditional Eastern European forms with jagged, prog-rock onslaughts, and integrates non-Western vocal styles—from Altai-style throat singing to throaty, piquant harmonies recalling the 4AD tapes of the Bulgarian State &amp; Television Female Vocal Choir.</p>
<p>By embracing a musical world that feels more in line with her present—and self-consciously down to earth—her new five-song EP, <i>Incitation</i>, provides something more immediately parsable than <i>Krai</i>. Like her 2011 full-length <a href=""https://bell.bandcamp.com/album/diamonite"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Diamonite</i></a>, <i>Incitation</i> consists of electro-pop music ready-made for one-person performance. Unlike <i>Krai</i>, Bell is not wrestling with demented mirror reflections of herself; the busy and tangled vocal counterpoint is gone. The digital instruments act as extensions of her strong solo voice in the center of the mix—the pointillistic MIDI synth figurations (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27809-glasser/"">Glasser</a>) on the periphery, the booming electroacoustic percussion and subdued bass. <i>Incitation</i> has an economy of purpose and more serious bent than her previous electronic work, in which Bell made a strong break from her years training as a concert classical pianist and paid tribute—in ecstatic, self-aware or outright jokey tones—to her new life as a composer and performer in New York City.</p>
<p>Instead of rushing to keep in time with skittery, double-time drum machines, Bell aims for the austere on this EP, embracing the melismatic melodies and damaged electronic architecture favored by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> and so many after her. The richly textured drum sampling is the most modern element, indebted to artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a> who have drawn threads from R&amp;B toward IDM and other realms of the avant-garde.</p>
<p>The lyrics are epigrammatic, and often solemn: They seem to address either her narrator’s self-doubt, or moments of impasse with a lover. In any case, some other soul or specter is always at play as an antagonist, even if it seems like it’s just Bell moving outside herself. In ""Rubbernecker"", the simple repeating piano riff forms an eccentric rhythmic relationship with the drum loop, perfectly underscoring Bell’s fraught diary entry of impressions from a recent national fly-over (the refrain: ""My soul, how hard you're driving/ Get along/ Watch your own road""). Likewise, on ""Goalie"", a synth evoking woodblocks hammers nervously away, as gutted, uneven drum beats pull in and out at random. Bell’s melodies come through with pealing clarity, but her emotions seem harder to pin down: ""For all the tiny muscles in your hand, you don’t shake like I thought you would.""</p>
<p>If <i>Krai</i> was on the verge of being irreducibly complex, <i>Incitation</i> risks cutting to the chase too hastily. The songs make an impression only after several run-throughs, and the appeal of some (the title track and ""Pounder I"", especially) waxes and wanes across their duration, sometimes feeling too risk-averse. It feels good to be drawn closer by Bell—to be trusted—but one can’t help but wish for some more complications to the narrative. The music is comfortable, hinting in plenty of promising directions but hesitating from going all the way toward them.</p></div>"|21089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21089-incitation-ep/|7.2|Winston Cook-Wilson

As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32303-dj-marfox/"">DJ Marfox</a>, the scene's unofficial current figurehead, <a href=""http://www.mixmag.net/feature/cargaa-cult/20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a> earlier this year, it's also ""the same word for when your heart beats when you have a car crash."" It's perfect sensory context for the heavily percussive polyrhythms streaming from these isolated projects, mostly filled with emigrants from Angola, São Tomé E Príncipe, and other former Portuguese colonies: jarring, frantic, but alive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But for years, there was no platform for batida producers to release any of this stuff; it existed communally—in the Quinta do Mocho and Quinta da Vitória and other remote housing projects, built hastily after Portugal's 1974 revolution brought a sea of immigrants from former colonies to the crowded city—or not at all. Then came <a href=""http://principediscos.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Príncipe Discos</a>, a tight-knit local label fiercely devoted to ""100% real contemporary dance music coming out of this city, its suburbs, projects and slums."" Since their first release in 2011, DJ Marfox's <i><a href=""http://principediscos.bandcamp.com/album/eu-sei-quem-sou-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eu Sei Quem Sou </a></i><a href=""http://principediscos.bandcamp.com/album/eu-sei-quem-sou-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EP</a> (or ""I Know Who I Am""), the label has been committed to respectfully representing and propagating these singular, community-driven sounds.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The label's latest is <i>Alma Do Meu Pai</i>, a six-track EP from DJ Firmeza, a producer and DJ born in Portugal but of Angolan descent. At 20, he is one of the batida scene's younger members, but his first solo release on the label is refined and mature. Within the Príncipe catalog, Firmeza is more of a minimalist than peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32830-dj-nigga-fox/"">DJ Nigga Fox</a>. Melody is almost never a factor on <i>Alma Do Meu Pai</i>, which translates to ""Soul of My Father"" in honor of his recently deceased dad. His focus is percussion above all else—sparse, efficient, streamlined. Closing track ""Suposto"" evokes a soca rhythm whittled down and deconstructed; a lilting flute traipses through the remains, head-faking towards melody before it becomes a percussive element itself. You don't see it coming. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Most batida tracks are short, two-minute bursts, suited for dancers' wandering attention spans. But the title track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17700-dj-firmeza-alma-do-meu-pai/"">""Alma Do Meu Pai""</a> clocks in at over six minutes, churning and lurching at a breathless 143 BPM. At a glance, it's repetitive; it's easy to let it all blur together and submit to its current. But with focus, you notice subtle deviations in rhythm, the layers, the way the percussive components move in connection with one another. But instead of cold metallics, this stuff feels warm, organic, very much human, as though each element of a track is part of a larger conversation.</p>
<p>It's tempting to explore <i>Alma Do Meu Pai </i>in parallel with underground dance genres like footwork or grime. The movements function in socially similar ways, forging stunningly unique sounds and dances from urban tensions. But batida is different. As Pedro Gomes, one of Príncipe's four label heads, <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?2021"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">emphasized</a>: ""This is not techno, this is not house, this is not dubstep, this is not grime—this is this, it's not anything else, so if you want this... present this for what it is."" <i>Alma Do Meu Pai</i>, then, is a calm, strange, and deceptively simple study in what can be wrung out of rhythm. It is music for dancing, and for contemplation. And though it is not an explicitly political record, the fact that we are hearing it at all, from the remote projects of Lisbon the city itself forgot, is a political act in itself.</p></div>"|21195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21195-alma-do-meu-pai-ep/|7.6|Meaghan Garvey

With that cover, the Salt Lake City foursome established itself as a band that wasn’t afraid to tinker, deconstruct, or simply open up and let its guts spill out. <i>Lightless Walk</i> is the group’s debut full-length, and while it doesn’t contain any left-field covers, it certainly doesn’t need them.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of Cult Leader hail from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30649-gaza/"">Gaza</a>, the defunct, progressive grindcore outfit whose 2012 swansong <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17102-no-absolutes-in-human-suffering/""><i>No Absolutes in Human Suffering</i></a><i> </i>wound up being the most intense thing they ever produced. <i>Lightless Walk</i> tops it. Gaza bassist Anthony Lucero has moved up to lead vocals for Cult Leader (with new bassist Sam Richards abetting guitarist Mike Mason and drummer Casey Hansen), and his doom-soaked howl is enough to leave you wondering what took him so long to front a band. On the mutated, d-beat-meets-blastbeats jolt that is ""Walking Wasteland"", Lucero sings from his intestines instead of his lungs, letting Mason’s caustic riffs wash over him like an acid bath. ""Great I Am"" makes great use of space, hovering distortion, and needles of feedback that are somehow crosshatched into insidious melody. On the whole, Cult Leader is a more aggressive yet concise band than Gaza—and one that gets the notion of merciless self-editing. The closest that the album comes to Gaza’s savage, unrelenting excoriation of organized religion is ""Gutter Gods"", but even then, Lucero’s head-splitting refrain of ""Our eyes are open"" feels more introspective, haunted, and full of metaphysical dread than simply accusatory.</p>
<p>Yet <i>Lightless Walk</i> works just as well, if not better, when it crawls and sprawls. ""A Good Life"" dissolves into a drone of lurching arpeggios and Lucero’s chanted baritone; similarly, ""How Deep It Runs"" decelerates to a hypnotic slither. But it’s <i>Lightless Walk</i>’s title track that truly shows off the lessons Cult Leader learned from covering Kozelek. At over seven minutes, the song lays a tribal beats over atmospheric, minimalist guitar, a slowcore reinvention of grind that gives Lucero what seems like horrific amounts of room in which to wander, ponder, and lament—not to mention show off his chops as an apocalyptic crooner. At points, the song resembles the recent output of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a> in both ritualistic bleakness and ambition. If that’s a hint of where Cult Leader might head from here on out, even better.</p>
<p>There’s a backstory to <i>Lightless Walk</i>. Gaza’s frontman Jon Parkin was <a href=""http://www.metalinsider.net/splits/gaza-has-broken-up"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">accused of rape</a> in 2012; Gaza broke up shortly thereafter. Since then, the remaining three members have cut all ties with Parkin and <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/music/article/cult_leader-forging_ahead"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spoken of him</a>, when prodded, with a mix of bitterness and frustration. That said, <i>Lightless Walk</i> doesn’t feel in any way like some misguided attempt at vindication. The shadow of Gaza doesn’t hang over the album at all. Instead, the music casts its own shadows: deep, long, and teeming with the ghosts of things lost.</p></div>"|21152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21152-lightless-walk/|7.5|Jason Heller

Until now, their pace of releases has indicated a grasp of the spot their music held in listeners’ hearts; the world that Alex Scally and Victoria Legrand build on their records is a place we want to revisit, but the spaces in between records has felt essential to that magic. They are in their own way a theatrical band, and what’s more theatrical than a well-placed pause? </p>
<p>Which all makes the appearance of <i>Thank Your Lucky Stars</i>, the band’s second full-length in as many months, surprising. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20691-depression-cherry/""><i>Depression Cherry</i></a> is still very much in view, and as fans, it feels a bit like the cast to a hit show suddenly reappearing for one more encore after the house lights have switched on and we were filing out. <i>Thank Your</i>’s nine songs were recorded at the same time as <i>Depression Cherry</i>, and they do have a slightly darker edge: Legrand <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61531-beach-house-releasing-new-album-thank-your-lucky-stars-next-week/"">said</a> that the album was more ""political"" in nature and that they felt the need for these songs to exist on their own, separate from the long-lens telegraphing of the typical album release cycle.</p>
<p>Their sound feels purposefully smaller, tamping down the reverb that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13872-teen-dream/""><i>Teen Dream</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16604-beach-house-bloom/""><i>Bloom</i></a>, and <i>Depression Cherry</i> feel like they were recorded in great stone cathedrals. You can hear them experimenting more with ""off"" notes in their otherwise-immaculate arrangements. On ""Somewhere Tonight"", Legrand lets a sour note sneak into one of her organ runs, and ""One Thing"" opens with a heavy cloud of electric guitar that feels more tethered to snaking cables and rattling amps than usual. Spiritually, the album feels closer to the mood the duo cultivated before they signed to <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop</a>: These songs feel pneumatic, dusty, like they are pulling a blanket around themselves in a heatless attic to ward off a threatening chill.</p>
<p>The mood is also bleaker in spots, as if joy and comfort had vanished from the songs along with the reverb. ""All Your Yeahs"" is closer to the midnight sulk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30140-johnny-jewel/"">Johnny Jewel</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"">Chromatics</a> than their usual open-air romanticism. And ""Elegy to the Void"", the album’s clear standout, might be the most death-obsessed Beach House have ever been: The organ processional that wells up in the song’s intro has a funereal tinge, while Legrand sings darkly of ""Sons and daughters/ Bending at the altar/ Disappearing in the mirror."" The song offers a series of gorgeous images—a ""black clock, looming distant"" and ""freckle-faced young virgin""—as it surges into a slow-motion burst, Scally’s normally crystalline guitar breaking apart like a DNA strand uncoupling. </p>
<p>But <i>Thank Your</i> is still undeniably a Beach House album, a familiar mix of warm tones and chilly sentiments. With the imprint still fading on <i>Depression</i>, <i>Thank Your’</i>s impact is undeniably dulled, causing a strange ""too much of a good thing"" problem. You start noticing surface similarities that you wouldn’t pay attention to otherwise: Play the arpeggiated keyboard figure that opens this album’s ""Common Girl"" next to <i>Bloom</i>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PC224Bz1ZA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""On the Sea""</a>, for instance. Their music is built on echoes: even their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9502-beach-house/"">self-titled debut</a> felt like covers of chansons you didn’t remember. Timing isn’t <i>everything</i>, of course, and <i>Thank Your Lucky Star</i><i>s</i>, as surprising a gesture of generosity as it is, is still welcome. But Legrand and Scally, who know their way around a stage, would do well to gracefully exit left for a while and give this run of music some time to sink in.</p></div>"|21197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21197-thank-your-lucky-stars/|8.1|Jayson Greene

Over the course of two albums for James Murphy's DFA label, 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13334-see-mystery-lights/"">See Mystery Lights</a></i> and 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15581-shangri-la/"">Shangri-La</a></i>, the pair shared vocal and songwriting duties, crafting disco-touched pop songs exploring cosmic anomalies, hallucinatory excursions, and utopian ideals. It never mattered much that the <a href=""http://store.dfarecords.com/products/dfa2207?variant=258831890"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>basis of their sound</span></a> started as an homage to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>—hell, even the <a href=""https://vimeo.com/1557384"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>music video</span></a> to ""Summer Song"" was an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnTUSgHzZx0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>homage</span></a>—because their attitudes and charisma elevated the music. At their best, YACHT gave us Devo's wit, Blondie's grace, and Tom Tom Club's playful energy, all wrapped in a knowing grin and a clever concept.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Four years later, YACHT has changed, sort of. Evans, now the sole lead singer, is pictured alone on the cover of </span><i>I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler, </i>and<span> the title makes clear that she now has </span><i>something to say</i><span>. It all seems promising on paper: Evans' credentials posit her as a strong, intelligent voice, and YACHT's punky dance-pop would ostensibly sit well within the latest '80s resurgence. And yet not quite.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For one, although her tone has shifted drastically, the music has remained as upbeat as ever, even goofy in places. At the beginning of </span><i>I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler</i>, Evans sings, ""I only learned who I loved when I left them all in the past,"" and by its end she's shouting, ""Give me entertainment! Death by entertainment!""<span> It makes for a jarring match. When we're told of ""mediated war zones and countries full of death"" over breezy post-disco grooves and light Rhodes chords in ""Matter"", it's like a friend making an off-color joke over text—you're pretty sure they're being sarcastic, but it definitely didn't sound that way.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There is some solid songwriting on <i>Future</i>. The juxtaposition of bubblegum new wave and tender synth-pop in ""Don't Be Rude"" feels effortless and inventive, and ""Miles &amp; Miles"" is a rousing throwback to those DFA albums. Bechtolt's co-production with Rob Kieswetter recalls <i>Midnite Vultures</i> electro-funk on ""Hologram"". But for every decent takeaway, we're confronted with ""I Wanna Fuck You Til I'm Dead"" or the spastic, vibe-killing chorus of ""Ringtone"", nonsensical amalgams that range from tactless to tone deaf to straight obnoxious. They're YACHT's uncanny valley: lifelike approximations of late-'90s power pop, early '00s Top 40, and blog-house mp3s that somehow aren't lifelike enough. </p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-775653a7-6bf0-35ab-e64c-b94b765f951d""><i>I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler</i><span> has good intentions. As Evans told </span><i><a href=""http://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/lightning-round-claire-l-evans/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LA Mag</a></i><span>, ""The central thesis is not that we're disappointed that we were promised jet packs. It's more like, I don't care about jet packs if we still don’t have basic human rights."" Songs comment on our increasing tech obsessions, societal violence and inequality, and future fatigue with effusive hooks, lending each decidedly familiar arrangement a fresh immediacy thanks to upgraded production values. Their messages, however, are in turns vague ruminations, condescending truisms, or just foregone conclusions for anyone with an interest in current events. </span><i>Future</i><span> is YACHT's would-be critique of our pre-dystopian, post-Internet culture, but it rarely comes off as more than a charismatic cover band singing us yesterday's news.</span></span></p></div>"|21181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21181-i-thought-the-future-would-be-cooler/|5.0|Patric Fallon

That EP was a daring first statement with soulful alternative rock jams supercut with real, recorded fights he had with his mother. It was stuffed with big ideas, but it often had trouble wrangling them. Still, it effectively established Raury as this sort of genre migrant who existed adjacent to the rap world without sounding much like it. The singer-songwriter has a real sense for composition and a knack for ambiguity, and he, like his stylistic forebear <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/"">André 3000</a>, remains at arm's length from hip-hop, never quite a full-fledged rapper but certainly draped in the tropes of the genre, reaping the benefits of everything cool and useful that comes from identifying with it. He is literally indie rap, and his debut album, <i>All We Need</i>, searches further for perfect balance.</p>
<p><i>All We Need</i> isn't the transcendent Raury project that’s been foreshadowed since he became a blog darling, the one that reconciles genre distinctions and renders them obsolete. It isn't ahead of its time or magnificent in scope. Instead, much like <i>Indigo Child</i>, it's merely an exhibition for a young creative still figuring out the true extent of his genius with as many hiccups. The wrinkles haven't been ironed out yet; his genre-mashing can be scatterbrained and even hollow. Sometimes, like on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"">RZA</a>-featuring ""CPU"", it works well and sometimes, like on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"">Big K.R.I.T.</a>-featuring ""Forbidden Knowledge"", it completely misses the mark. Raury emerged with a fully formed aesthetic, but his sound, albeit fascinating, still needs time to incubate.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>From start to finish, </span><i>All We Need</i><span> scans as</span><i> Indigo Child Redux</i><span> with similar pacing and nearly identical tropes. This one is anchored by its single, ""Devil’s Whisper"", which puts a slightly darker tint on the hand-clapping-around-the-campfire folk of its predecessor. The album is mostly a reprise of his boho hippie rap tunes, wandering in and out of folk territory with lots of stringy acoustic riffs, hedging toward rock with hip-hop spirit, casually blending influences like a Tumblr kid that grew up in a post-Napster world. The writing is angst-y and centric to a wide-eyed, teenage worldview: chasing girls and soothing parents and saving the Earth. On the opening title track, he sets the tone for his flower child vibes: ""Don’t hate, my brother/ God is our friend/ I walked for miles and/ I see no end/ To the hate.""</span></p>
<p>Many of the songs call for unity and love with several mentions of an impending Armageddon, and Raury tackles these huge topics with ambitious arrangements. On ""Revolution"", he pleads for divine intervention over strum-heavy riffs, throbbing 808 bass, hand drums, and vocal chops. On the slow-moving ""Peace Prevail"", which has a tempering rhythm and melting bass, he borrows André 3000's flow to rap about being a rap outlier (""Been by myself since the White T’s/ Been by myself since Dem Franchize Boyz did that dance on that hoe in the white tee"") before praying for peace with a chorus of voices at his back. There’s significantly more rapping here than on his last release, and while dextrous rapping isn’t exactly his forte, there are moments where he finds his flow. It doesn't feel like he's gotten <i>that</i> much better at what he does, but he seems to be figuring it out. He's got people like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3515-rage-against-the-machine/"">Rage Against the Machine</a>'s Tom Morello and underground Atlanta rapper <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/fatmankey"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Key!</a> on the album to help him. With an album replete with Spanish guitar jams, wide-eyed hip-hop, and psychedelic rock k-holes, there isn't much ground left for Raury to cover. Now, he must figure out how to do it all just a little bit better.</p></div>"|21172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21172-all-we-need/|6.8|Sheldon Pearce

She recorded the four-song <i>Cardamom Times</i> EP on a reel-to-reel deck in her Rockaway, N.Y., home studio; it sounds like a lush, pristine folk-rock gem rescued from the 1960s. The playing is patient and assured, and you can't say enough about her voice, a dusky, soulful soprano that draws you into her world as well as into a larger tradition. She has the kind of voice that’s both distinctive and familiar, and it fits perfect with her style: the arrangements are at once classic, sneakily innovative, and entirely her own.</p>
<p><i>Cardamon Times</i> follows Mering's second album, 2014's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19792-weyes-blood-the-innocents/""><i>The Innocents</i></a>. It's more pure, and the overall sound is less composed. Instead of a complex studio creation, it comes off like an overheard monologue in the woods. The rural, solitary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT4iGmVlwS8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for the stunning five-and-a-half-minute closer ""In the Beginning"", which was shot on Super 8 film in Northern Canada and finds Mering wandering the countryside by herself, captures this feel.</p>
<p><i>Cardamom</i> sounds a bit like an archival folk collection but it's filled with suprising details. The lengthy ""Take You There"" opens with a minute of melancholic organ drone; for the rest of the track, she sings over the fluctuating keys without any percussion. Opener ""Maybe Love"" has pretty, Sundays-like guitar strums and eventually, at songs's end, noise is layered beneath ghostly multi-tracked voices. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17655-weyes-blood-cardamom/"">""Cardamom""</a>, her voice is almost distorted beside crystal clear guitar picking and a piping flute. As you listen more closely, subtle touches distance Mering's music from the purely nostalgic.</p>
<p>Her lyrics feel personal. <i>Cardamom Times</i> mostly focuses on love, lost and found and lost again. ""Maybe Love"" includes the touching, realistic detail: ""I like seeing you notice me/ When I’m feeling better about/ You and me."" The old-timey sounding ""Cardamom"" snaps into the present when she sings: ""I like your band, can I hold your hand this time?/ Do you find what I do kind of cool?/ Would we last a minute or two?"" Nothing seems permanent here, even when the music is timeless.</p>
<p>""In the Beginning"", her best song to date, features a melancholic but catchy melody and an arrangement of guitars and organs and her voice. She sings about a field of stars. She sings about suffering and changing, of bittersweet meetings that happen at the wrong time. She asks ""Have you ever walked in on a Queen before?"" She admits she's not trying to relate at the moment. And she just keeps going, and it's astonishing. Her music seems so simple at first, but it keeps deepening. </p></div>"|21116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21116-cardamom-times-ep/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

Paterra wear their film-geek affinities on their sleeve. </span><span>The band's name is, in fact, derived from the Italian title of George A. Romero's <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, which was filmed at Moore's hometown shopping mall and scored by Italian prog rock outfit Goblin, a huge influence on Zombi along with Carpenter and other film composers such as Fabio Frizzi and Riz Ortolani.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Paterra and British documentary/video game composer Paul Lawler recently collaborated under the moniker <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/temporary-residence-ltd-1/first-contact"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Contact</a>, while Moore has embarked on a side career scoring films on his own, most recently supplying the score for Belgian director Jonas Govaerts' 2014 horror movie <i>Cub</i>. <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Relapse Records</a> is, in fact, releasing Zombi's fifth full-length <i>Shape Shift</i> and the <i>Cub</i> soundtrack on the same day. It's impossible to ignore the common thread between the two albums, and since the <i>Cub</i> score doesn't do enough to re-contextualize Moore's approach to harmony, it only serves to reveal his limitations in Zombi. But, as Moore has made clear in <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/zombi-interview-2015"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent press</a>, he and Paterra have always considered Zombi a post-rock outfit that happens to use the vocabulary of soundtracks. In their view, their work has more in common with, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4277-trans-am/"" target=""_blank"">Trans Am</a> than it does with those aforementioned cinematic influences.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Indeed, Zombi's third album, 2009's </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13046-spirit-animal/"">Spirit Animal</a></i><span>, combined the stately gesturing of Genesis' 1974 prog epic </span><i>The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</i><span> with the ominous intonation of film music. Somehow, Moore and Paterra managed to evoke the murky synthesizer ambience of the 1970s while also infusing their music with a decidedly modern aura. Though </span><i>Shape Shift</i><span> marks the first time since 2006's </span><i>Surface to Air</i><span> that Moore and Paterra made music in the same room with one another, the throbbing analog synth pulse of album opener ""Pillars of the Dawn"" suggests that the pair might have lost their ability to draw on their influences without getting stuck in the past. <span>Paterra's drums very precisely recall the tone and feel of drummer Neil Peart's performance circa </span><i>Signals</i><span>, Rush's 1982 head-first dive into synth-driven rock. From a purely sonic standpoint, it's an impressive feat to recapture the acoustic fingerprint of Peart's drums without using sample triggers, but you can't shake the sensation that you've just stepped out of a time machine and landed in the wrong year.</span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>In that way, <i>Shape Shift </i>initially comes across as pandering to retrophilia when Moore and Paterra have already demonstrated that they're clever enough to not have to resort to that kind of thing. That said, it doesn't take long for the band's underlying attitude to breathe life into this material. Two tracks in and it becomes clear that Moore and Paterra play with a fire that their musical forbears lacked. </span><span>Paterra in particular—the way his drumming both drives the music and makes room for it to breathe, the nuanced variations in the way he strikes the snare, hi-hat, and the bell of his ride cymbal—gives <i>Shape Shift</i> a gritty, utterly human quality that complements Moore's synthetic palette.</span> In general, Zombi favor mid-tempo grooves that require a lot of reserve, but Paterra reminds you at all times that you're listening to a rock band with an underlying sense of millennial angst, even if that angst is never explicitly articulated.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We are, after all, talking about long-winded mathy instrumental music here. But that's the thing: at some point while listening to </span><span><i>Shape Shif</i><i>t</i></span><span>, it dawns on you that you can actually hum all of these tunes. Sure, there are times when Moore and Paterra let their instincts to impose changes for their own sake get the better of them. Not far into the 8-minute-plus ""Interstellar Package"", a groove built out of an oscillating low-pitched synth throb grows to a majestic crescendo that prematurely gives way to six minutes' worth of undifferentiated drone, a move that short-circuits the tune's potential payoff. Nevertheless, in their own way Moore and Paterra write </span><span>catchy</span><span> music. That their tastes position them as soundtrack-buff outsiders at the fringes makes the cohesion, listenability, and passion of </span><i>Shape Shift</i><span> that much more of a triumph.</span></p></div>"|21171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21171-shape-shift/|7.2|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

Album</a></i> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17469-jesus-piece/"">Jesus Piece</a></i>, there won’t be a <i>Documentary 3</i>.</p>
<p>The Game’s last three LPs debuted, respectively at #2, #1, and #5, even with all of the dud singles that embedded their ignominious future prospects right into the first listen. Most would consider that a pretty decent run all things considered, but those albums all were modeled after <i>T</i><i>he Documentary—</i>hitch the Game to the greatest possible number of bandwagons and hope it moves. That continues on <i>The Documentary 2</i>, which features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake"">Drake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>, and Kanye West. But they don’t really show fealty to or chemistry with the Game—he’s more like the rich kid in high school whose parents are always out for the weekend. ""100"", the Drake feature, is Game’s first charting single since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ki21aILhoI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Celebration""</a> in 2013, and it’s a pleasure to hear Drake spit one of his hardest verses of 2015 after sounding like the walking dead on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21102-what-a-time-to-be-alive/"">What a Time to Be Alive</a></i>; about two minutes in, you forget the Game’s actually on it, and as for ""Mula"", Kanye sounds like he could’ve recorded his part in the time it takes to tie a pair of Red Octobers.</p>
<p>The one contemporary superstar who <i>does</i> sound happy to be here is Kendrick, and <i>The Documentary 2 </i>is best when it remembers what the Game is good at: making West Coast gangsta-rap records. Even if it still sounds like he’s learning new flows on the fly, the rapping on a Game album is about as important as the dialogue in a <i>Fast and Furious</i> movie<span>—</span>the funniest parts are wholly unintentional, as are the moments of emotional resonance. You’re here to see a bunch of famous dudes play with expensive toys. This is pretty much the sole purpose for ""Standing on Ferraris"", which features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7422-diddy/"">Diddy</a> and is about exactly what it promises.</p>
<p>Once more, the Game is in the right place at the right time<span>—</span>it’s a good year to make a West Coast, pop-gangsta rap record. Dr. Dre gave this <a href=""http://www.rap-up.com/2015/07/06/the-game-documentary-2-gets-dr-dre-blessing/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his blessing</a>, so we don’t get the Game spending the requisite 50% of <i>The Documentary 2</i> or so explaining Doc’s absence. And the usual dream team (Jahlil Beats, Mike WiLL Made It, Boi-1da, will.i.am, Hit-Boy, <i>DJ fucking Premier</i>) recreates the lush, filmic production that defined <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly"">To Pimp a Butterfly</a></i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19164-yg-my-krazy-life/"">My Krazy Life</a>,</i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20935-compton"">Compton</a></i><span>—</span>mid-song beat switches, segues, and well-placed samples make <i>The Documentary 2</i> sound like a record that was conceptualized in advance rather than the usual ""failed singles + Lil Wayne features"" conglomeration.</p>
<p>But since <i>The Documentary 2</i> is longer than most actual documentaries (to say nothing of the upcoming bonus LP <i>The Documentary 2.5</i>), the Game is given room to try on any number of identities: overcompensating Blood nostalgist (he would immediately correct this sentence to ""over<i>b</i>ompensating""), wounded alpha male emo-rapper, well-meaning but extremely awkward ""socially conscious Game"". What <i>doesn’t</i> pop up is <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9620-doctors-advocate"">Doctor's Advocate</a>-</i>style lone wolf Game; 50 Cent went <i>bankrupt</i> this year and when he gets mentioned, instead of going for the kill shot, the Game sorta wishes G-Unit could get the band back together.</p>
<p>It’s just as well that the Game shows as much love as possible—<i>The Documentary 2</i> solidifies him a grade-grubbing student of hip-hop, one with far more resources and drive than natural talent, but a student all the same. This year, we’ve seen <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20810-dirty-sprite-2/"">Dirty Sprite 2</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21043-fetty-wap"">Fetty Wap</a> </i>both top Billboard with a singular sound, street singles, and hands-off A&amp;R’ing<span>—</span>these records are both namedropped here. But like <i>The Documentary</i>, the sequel is a highly enjoyable tribute to old-school, cash-flush, crowd-pleasing, too-big-to-fail hip-hop album making, which can actually sound novel in 2015. The biggest lie he keeps telling is that any album he makes is definitely going to be his last. Can’t leave rap alone<span>—</span>the Game needs it.</p></div>"|20903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20903-the-documentary-2/|7.2|Ian Cohen

<p>The material for the album was unearthed during a fruitful crate-digging trip, when Khan and Carey obsessed over some rare psychedelic tracks from other countries. They found two songs from Iran: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grmAAcwUnqs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""<span class=""s1"">Ghoroobaa Ghashangan</span>""</a> (on the <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/releases/738-zendooni-funk-psychedelia-and-pop-from-the-iranian-pre-revolution-generation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light in the Attic comp <i>Zendooni</i></a>) and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVv5T_OapXc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Helelyos""</a> (a song by Iranian singer Zia that's appeared on several Iranian pre-revolutionary pop compilations). Two songs are featured on the <a href=""http://www.dust-digital.com/kassidat/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Raw 45s of Morocco</i> comp</a>: ""Ha Howa Ha Howa"" and ""Kassidat El Hakka"". The original version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgHa9y_boL4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lam Plearn Kiew Bao""</a> is from Thailand and can be found on a <a href=""https://www.soundwayrecords.com/Shop/PhysicalDetails?pid=SWR_PH_18"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soundway comp</a>. These songs' messages of liberation and passion are well suited to Khan's voice, especially at its most intense.</p>
<p>Compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17174-the-haunted-man/""><i>The Haunted Man</i></a>, Khan's untethered presence on <i>Sexwitch</i> is a departure. Her Bat for Lashes work foregrounds structure and melody, but here she takes key phrases and molds them, repeating and inverting them. When necessary, she makes her voice percussive, especially when she emphasizes the repeated words ""my dark girls"" on ""Helelyos"". Khan's performances are equal parts wild and controlled, and TOY have no trouble nailing these songs. They're funky on ""Ghoroobaa Ghashangan"" and their percussion work on ""Kassidat El Hakka"" is satisfyingly heavy. To Carey's credit, this album <i>sounds</i> great, too.</p>
<p>But since every song on <i>Sexwitch</i> is a cover, it begs the question: What do Sexwitch's versions add? Occasionally, they feel overlong. Repetition is key to this music, but after several cycles, tracks begin to plod, broken up only by Khan's vocal work. The Sexwitch interpretations lose vital elements from the originals like horns, organs, and bells.</p>
<p>The most successful cover is arguably the closer: Skip Spence's ""War in Peace"". It's an excellent choice, and it offers Sexwitch the opportunity to simmer, jam, and gradually ramp back up. ""War in peace,"" Khan sings, adding, ""What a funny combination."" The song is proof that they can thrive in the sweet spot between unchained freewheeling psychedelia and something more regimented and precise like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47895-listen-bat-for-lashes-all-your-gold/"">""All Your Gold""</a>. But then again, why tame a band that's hell-bent on staying untamed?</p></div>"|21198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21198-sexwitch/|6.4|Evan Minsker

It happens on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoSy50UnBnk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Your Destiny""</a>, and it’s the freest moment of a recording made in five hours in a Virginia federal prison.</p>
<p>Released in 1979, <i>Eyes of Love</i> was recorded in one take on a $3,000 budget at the Powhatan Correctional Center in State Farm, Va. The band members were all inmates, incarcerated for armed robbery and assault, with sentences ranging from six to 60 years. The musicians, some of whom played in other bands before they were locked up, were allowed to play instruments at the prison complex. They covered songs by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12335-the-isley-brothers/"">Isley Brothers</a>, Slave, and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Jamal Jahal Nubi, the Edge of Daybreak’s lead singer and drummer, entered the Virginia prison in 1976 and established another group called Cosmic Conception with Edward Tucker and William Crawley. He’d later form Edge of Daybreak with fellow prisoners Harry Coleman on additional vocals, James Carrington on keys, Cornelius Cade on guitar, McEvoy Robinson on bass, and Willie Williams on percussion. The band didn't have equipment to overdub, so they brought in backup musicians to play instruments when the regulars had to sing.</p>
<p>A few local media outlets covered <i>Eyes of Love</i> upon its release. Only 1,000 copies were pressed. ""PM Magazine"", a now-defunct television news show, produced a segment called ""Cellblock Rock"" that aired footage of Edge of Daybreak’s recording. The album arrived as the outside world was moving away from brassier sounds for the likes of disco and nu-wave. Up the road in Washington, D.C., musicians like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46538-rip-chuck-brown-godfather-of-go-go/"">Chuck Brown</a> and <a href=""http://www.troublefunk.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trouble Funk</a> were putting their own unique twist on black music. Their blend was called go-go, a percussive strain of funk designed to keep the beat going without breaks.</p>
<p>In a way, the Edge of Daybreak seemed influenced by the homegrown genre, and at certain points on <i>Eyes of Love</i>, you sense the band’s urge to break away from the literal and figurative structures that contained them. Given their circumstances, it would’ve been easy for the group to create something sullen. Yet on <i>Eyes of Love</i>, it’s as if the band wanted to uplift themselves through song, and to forget their living arrangements if only for a few hours. These songs are optimistic, touching on the brilliance of love and glorifying romance in all its sugary splendor. Songs like ""Let Us"" and ""Let’s Be Friends"" recall the 1960s doo-wop era, while ""Edge of Daybreak"" and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4Bnp60fYA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Dance With You""</a> are extensive dance grooves.</p>
<p>Thematically, <i>Eyes of Love</i> is about a group of guys making the best of a tough situation. That a collection of inmates even recorded an album is a testament, and the fact that it’s so well done is a plus. The inmates couldn’t just go to the studio. Prison personnel required Alpha Audio—in nearby Richmond—to record the band at the Powhatan complex. They had to sing and play their instruments simultaneously, and get everything right the first time. The album’s last song, ""Our Love"", was recorded as prison guards told the band to wrap up recording. The group members were taken back to their cells as soon as the last song finished. Despite the duress, there aren’t any noticeable hiccups on the LP, making me wonder what could’ve been if the band had more time to perfect it.</p>
<p>By the fall of 1980, keyboardist Carrington was transferred to another prison. Then vocalist Coleman. Then Cade, who was moved to Powhatan’s North Housing Unit, essentially breaking up the Edge of Daybreak. There were talks of a sophomore album, but with the musicians in separate prison facilities, it was impossible to rehearse. In the end, <i>Eyes of Love</i> would be the group’s swan song. Thirty-six years later, it’s still a living testament to what can be done in tumultuous conditions. It’s a push to make a way, and to persevere, even when the light is dim.</p></div>"|21013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21013-eyes-of-love/|7.3|Marcus J. Moore

<p dir=""ltr"">Anyone hoping for fireworks upon Zomby's return is likely to be disappointed, as <i>Let's Jam!!</i> is slight both by XL's standards and the strictures of dance music 12""s.

<p>Locating that substance proves difficult. On <i>Let's Jam 1</i> Zomby (finally!) abandons his signature sound for something that amounts to a walking tour of early rave conventions—of the early history of XL, coincidentally or not—adding little to the equation. Opener ""Surf I"" is essentially a harmless electro sendup, featuring a low voice grunting the track's title while short melodic lines phase in and out. The problem is that, even for a low-stakes genre exercise, ""Surf I"" is badly lacking in dynamism, deploying that same curt vocal sample on the first downbeat of every other measure of the track while a short bassline repeats. It is noticeably repetitive in a realm in which repetition is basically the entire point.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">No, if you're looking for the type of subtle shifts and melodic changeups that are part and parcel to the very concept of dance music you'll have to wait for ""Surf II"", a similar concept but with just enough rhythmic interplay and moving pieces to register as improvement. If for some reason you should want to bridge these Zomby offers aforementioned tool ""Acid Surf"", which sounds like a parody of Zomby doing an acid track: a zippy 303 bassline, a sample of someone sternly declaring ""acid"", and lots of airhorn. ""Slime"", a coarse interpretation of the hoover bass sound, is a far better fit for Zomby's eerie sense of melody.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's less to say about <i>Let's Jam 2</i>, which returns Zomby to his default style—sparkling synths, fizzy square wave bass, pools of reverb—with diminishing returns. The best of the four tracks, ""Bloom"", wouldn't sound out of place on Local Action or Keysound Recordings or any of the other London labels releasing lush, forward-thinking bass explorations, but nor would it stand out. (More troublingly, you could say the same about its placement on Zomby's past two albums.) Grime has gotten vaster and braver in Zomby's absence; long reverb tails and gunshot percussion don't quite cut it anymore.</p>

It’s the third full-length by San Francisco’s Kowloon Walled City, a post-metal group that Scott Evans fronts as both singer/guitarist and producer. Wearing that many hats in a band suggests a position of authority, but you’d never guess that listening to <i>Grievances</i>. Evans subsumes his riffs within vast, oppressive swathes of empty space. He submits his voice to a process of industrialized monotony. His guitar doesn’t gently weep—it curls up, plays dead, and still isn’t able to halt its cataclysmic spasms.</p>
<p>Yet <i>Grievances</i> sounds anything but weak. Kowloon’s last album, 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17425-container-ships/""><i>Container Ships</i></a>, showed a shift toward refinement that felt more like a half measure, but here, Evans and crew have hit on something profound. It isn’t a concept album per se, but it does have an overarching theme: the psychic, social, and spatial anxieties of the modern workplace. But <i>Grievances</i> isn’t about run-of-the-mill disgruntled employment as much as it’s a haunting meditation on humanity’s disassociation from the product—or, in our increasingly cyber-centric world, the service—of its labor.</p>
<p>""You sell it like a poet,"" Evans howls on ""The Grift"", the centerpiece and high point of the album. It’s an accusation of self-commodification, seemingly aimed both inward and outward. It’s more than that, though; as a trainwreck of AmRep-style noise rock is sculpted into minimalist shapes, that structure becomes a metaphor for hollowness of all kinds. ""The fiction sells,"" Evans reiterates, and when he slams the ""confidence game"" of modern interpersonal commerce, his sardonic use of ""confidence"" is even more lacerating than his sly insinuation of melody.</p>
<p>At just over three and a half minutes, ""The Grift"" is the runt of the album. Song lengths stretch onward from there, including <i>Grievances</i>’ title track, which crawls along for nearly seven minutes’ worth of forlorn rage. While Evans levels the charge ""No love/ No memory/ Just admit it"", fellow guitarist Jon Howell locks into a pneumatic, dehumanized groove that sputters out in gasps of dead air. Bassist Ian Miller chugs and claws; drummer Jeff Fagundes (replaced by Julia Lancer since this recording) puts the brakes on spacetime. If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"">Godflesh</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"">Codeine</a> had ever conspired to hybridize, it might have come out like this: bleak but bare, mechanistic yet melancholic.</p>
<p><i>Grievances</i> is inalienably heavy, but it’s not sludge in the conventional sense. On ""Your Best Years"", the distortion is more clotted than fuzzy, with immaculate slabs of dissonance left dangling overhead. But it’s ""Backlit"" that sums up the huge step forward Kowloon has taken with <i>Grievances</i>. Arid and static at first, it builds into a monument to grim resignation that feels weathered and ancient right out of the gate. ""Wear out your weaknesses,"" Evans half-commands, half-implores; later he adds, ""Wear all your weaknesses."" Resistance is futile, but in that steadfast futility there is strength.</p></div>"|21149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21149-grievances/|7.8|Jason Heller

Night School </i>over the span of four years<i> </i>at a number of crash pads across America, but most crucial to the album was a self-described ""magical winter"" the singer spent on a Carnival Fantasy Cruise ship with his brother, who played in the house band. (Insert chillwave joke here.) The album contains enough reggae and Balearic tropical breeze to prove Palomo doesn’t shy away from pleasing the lido deck, but beyond the kitsch, <span>an extended stay in a floating, inescapable city is an apt metaphor for </span><i>VEGA INTL. Night School</i><span>, where the inherent danger of total immersion is offset by generous hospitality.</span></p>
<p>Palomo acts a gracious host, delivering the most deluxe, comprehensive Neon Indian album yet. He's presenting the 51-minute record as a ""double album"" and the interstitial bits ensure the beat never stops. <span>The production values are higher, and there’s even more of Palomo's queasy pitch-shifting, 16-bit synths, and disembodied samples</span>—more of everything. Palomo might have seemed like someone stumbling onto a recipe with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13510-psychic-chasms/""><i>Psychic Chasms</i></a>, but now it's clear that this is Palomo’s foundational music, his blues or funk.</p>
<p>Palomo's riff on the idea of ""night school"" is the album's unifying thematic construct<span id=""docs-internal-guid-8de6ad0f-6181-0ce2-64aa-91b9514f2fe6""><span>: stay up after midnight, and you’ll learn about how human nature really works. In this way, the progression of Neon Indian is best seen as Palomo moving from PG-13 to NC-17—if you dial the <a href=""http://www.nightschool.biz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian<i> </i>hotline</a> he set up for this album, what you hear is a voice purring ""hey there, sexy."" Everyone’s committing crimes of passion on <i>VEGA INTL</i>.—a missed phone call occasions a ""CSI"" investigation on <a href=""k.com/reviews/tracks/17501-neon-indian-annie"">""Annie""</a> and on ""Baby's Eyes"" Vega harbors a charismatic murderer. Elsewhere, we're exposed to a polyamorous tryst in ""Smut!"" after a chance meeting behind the red curtain in the porno section of a video store.</span></span></p>
<p>So consider <i>VEGA INTL.</i> Palomo finally freeing his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/from-the-pitchfork-review/9731-do-it-all-night-the-story-of-princes-dirty-mind/"">dirty mind</a>, even as the music maintains a veneer of innocence. Neon Indian is an inherently nostalgic project, and Palomo views the musical cross-pollination of the early '80s as unfinished business rather than something to romanticize. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15817-era-extrana/""><i>Era Extraña</i></a> framed Palomo as the rock star he could often seem on stage, engaging in the pouty, guitar-centric forms of post-punk—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J6dGCS6bBE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shoegaze</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGHEsPdvcVI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MTV-friendly goth</a> in particular. Conversely, <i>VEGA INTL.</i> recalls the synthesists who took ""post-punk"" as a mandate to leave punk rock behind. The reggae bump of ""Annie"" and ""61 Cygni Ave"" recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4116-scritti-politti/"">Scritti Politti</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7099-the-police/"">the Police</a>, and there’s plenty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9486-tom-tom-club"">Tom Tom Club</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/630-blondie"">Blondie</a> in the album's bubbly disco.</p>
<p>The cumulative impression of <i>VEGA INTL.</i>, then,<i> </i>is that of a Carnival Cruise night based around New York's Danceteria, circa 1982, a place and time of glaring blight as well as utopian all-night clubs where synth-pop, disco, funk, R&amp;B, and early hip-hop were feeding off one another. Any artist trying to capture the spirit of that specific era has to reckon with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>, a personification of the idealism of early '80s pop, and Palomo finally gets there at the end of the record: ""News from the Sun (Live Bootleg)"" recalls both the insular psychedelia of <i>Around the</i> <i>World in a Day</i>, the ""is it <i>really</i> live?"" crowd noise of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9700-the-200-best-songs-of-the-1980s/10/"">""Purple Rain""</a>, and the communal ecstasy of <i>Sign 'o’ the Times</i>. Before the final leap into a daredevil key modulation, Palomo delivers the record’s final line: ""We’re all just waiting for something—'til love touches you like a hand in the dark."" Those words encompass the starry-eyed ideal as well as the unsavory reality of how people tend to find love. Morning might bring to light all of the shameful things that have just gone down, but ""News from the Sun"" assures that whatever happens on this fantasy cruise stays there.</p></div>"|21041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21041-vega-intl-night-school/|8.6|Ian Cohen

They don't have a Wikipedia page. They're signed to Jeezy's CTE World imprint, but haven't released an official single on the label since 2013's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYg1jj9qw2U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mob Life"" remix</a>, to say nothing of a full-length project. But the Doughboyz—whose membership has ranged from four to eight members since the group's 2006 inception—are currently the biggest street rappers in Detroit, and the best rap group in the Midwest.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Doughboyz' latest, <i>BYLUG World</i> (short for ""Boss Yo Life Up Gang""), is a relatively minor release in the group's nearly decade-long career. It's not as consistent as last year's excellent <i>We Run The City 4</i> tape, and lacks the immediate hits of 2012's <i>Free Roc</i>, their best work. There's nothing resembling a crossover play in the vein of <span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soihin0Uda8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""My Young Niggaz""</a>,</span> a DJ Mustard-produced collaboration with Jeezy and YG; in fact, label boss Jeezy shows up exactly zero times here. But for longtime fans and those nostalgic for turn-of-the-century Cash Money and No Limit, there's a lot to love.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To the uninitiated, <i>BYLUG World</i> may sound anachronistic: the stabby piano, the rubber-band bass, and <i>bounce </i>are pure Mannie Fresh worship. Most of <i>BYLUG World</i>'s production is handled by Payroll Giovanni, who doubles as Doughboyz' most popular solo rapper; you can hear the eerie ricochet of Fresh in most of his tracks here, from menacing opener ""BYLUG Baby"" to the stripped-down murder piano of ""OVL"". But like Fresh's best work, the production leaps out while providing space for the tape's rotating cast of rappers. And ultimately, storytelling is at the heart of Doughboyz' appeal. <i>BYLUG</i>'s sole time-stamped moment, ""Netflix"", should be a goofy throwaway about <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/netflix-and-chill"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Netflix and chill</a>, but its novelty is redeemed by Payroll's deft but unshowy bars: ""She was intimidated when I pulled up, for example/ She couldn't find the coupe door handles.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The tape's blunt edges are softened by the occasional warbling melody from Clay Baby—the closest thing Detroit has to a Nate Dogg, who delivers the tape's best hook on ""Fell Off""—and a handful of smooth, contemplative synth-scapes from former Taylor Gang producer Cardo. On YG-featuring ""Day Ones"", he evokes a screwed-up, waterlogged <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"">AraabMuzik</a>, and on his G-funk-leaning ""Street Heaven"", Payroll offers a coolly specific narrative that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"">Curren$y</a>: ""Meanwhile, I'm cracking smiles at Mr. Chow's/ Out in Cali, would I like another drink?/ Yes, gladly."" But the celebration is shaded by struggle and countered with knowing paranoia: ""Lately I been having dreams of trucks and 7s/ And nightmares of the Feds wanting me in their possession."" This tightrope walk of aspiration and consequence is the Doughboyz' formula stripped down to its essence. Even at its core, i<span>t hits as hard as ever.</span></p></div>"|21202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21202-bylug-world/|6.8|Meaghan Garvey

The roster boasts a host of eclectic wordsmiths like Project Blowed associate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/"">Open Mike Eagle</a>, L.A. veteran <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/512-busdriver/"">Busdriver</a>, and NxWorries member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33213-andersonpaak/"">Anderson .Paak</a>, who recently started to garner public attention after being prominently featured on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20935-compton/""><i>Compton</i></a>. In 2013, the collective’s 17 track compilation, <i>Dorner vs. Tookie</i>, spotlit yet another featured lyricist: milo, aka Scallops Hotel, a Wisconsin transplant who carves poetry out of multisyllabics, scheming in micro-bursts and tightly woven yarns.</p>
<p>Last year, milo (whose real name is Rory Ferreira) released his refreshing debut album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19878-milo-a-toothpaste-suburb/"">a toothpaste suburb</a></i>, which delivered wisecracks with a straight face, matching sharp barbs into sequences and carefully squeezing in references to Harry Potter, Jean Genet, Clementine Hunter, Kant, and Kim Kardashian—and that was just the opener. milo has a deadpan he uses to serve up witticisms that often double as smart jokes (and sometimes crude ones). Not all of his bars are one-liners, but they are all connected to at least one tangentially. </p>
<p>His latest album, <i>so the flies don't come</i>, is his most fascinating work to date, filling weird, side-winding productions that deflate and wheeze with tumbling lyricism delivered in near spoken word cadences. The project is entirely produced by electronic-leaning hip-hop producer Kenny Segal and the two have a real chemistry, with a shared inclination for the off-kilter and the oddball. Segal’s beats, synth-heavy abstractions that turn chords into cushions, make fitting soundbeds for milo’s staggered raps. Occasionally milo nestles into the sidewalls, like on ""souvenir"", and then quickly lurches out into pockets of dead space before retreating back. His blank, sometimes wooden demeanor is often betrayed by the snappiness of his writing, which somehow manages to capture Nietzche-esque nihilism with the comic simplicity of the shrugging emoticon.</p>
<p>milo has a knack for using quips as a lens through which to stare into the void, but his greatest strength lies in his very particular way with words. Songs like ""an encyclopedia"" and ""napping under the Echo Tree"" tell stories in their own language, something milo himself seems to understand; on the former, he opens, ""No one taught me the language of rap song/ I was born speaking it."" With such an innate understanding of rhythm and timing, it certainly sounds like it. His speech patterns vary, not so much abiding by the restraints of production as acknowledging them before ignoring them.</p>
<p>When milo isn’t playing around with funny phonetic sounds or fidgeting with tricky taunts, he’s just making flat out great hip-hop. The song ""going no place"" proves he’s capable of adhering to conventional rap standards with compact verses. On the closer, ""song about a raygunn (an ode to Driver)"", he gives a critical reading of aesthetics, something like a thesis: ""Parse good from the nonsense/ Never let the form dictate what's the content/ It's never art for art's sake/ Despite whatever the corpse of a Marxist thinks."" He closes the thought—and the album, with, ""I guess I'm stupid/ Following a rule is just too hard for me/ It's hardly me."" But if there’s one thing milo isn’t, it’s dumb. It’s his inability to follow the rules that makes his music so smart.</p></div>"|21199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21199-so-the-flies-dont-come/|7.4|Sheldon Pearce

A wildly successful hybrid of dance music and jazz, it put St Germain on tour for over two years, sharing stages with the likes of Herbie Hancock and playing the likes of Glastonbury and Royal Albert Hall. Trend pieces lumped St Germain in with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/701-cassius/"">Cassius</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a> as purveyors of ""the French Touch."" In the intervening 15 years, there have been three French presidents, and trends in dance music have moved far beyond the realms of nu-jazz and downtempo, Navarre's métier at the turn of the century. Consider that Navarre's closest peers, Daft Punk, released <i>Discovery</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2137-human-after-all/""><i>Human After All</i></a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14938-tron-legacy-ost/""><i>Tron: Legacy OST</i> </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/""><i>Random Access Memories </i></a>in that same time period, and it's a drastically different world that St Germain returns to with this self-titled album.</p>
<p>Fans of St Germain's old work might find little that's instantly recognizable from <i>Tourist</i>, which was part of Navarre's strategy. ""I had to stop completely, I just had to take a break from music,"" he <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/st-germain-i-can-t-just-throw-stuff-out-there-10465674.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> <i>The Independent</i>. ""I realised that I didn't want to do something like <i>Tourist</i> again – I needed to do something new."" And so he disappeared for most of the '00s until this past June, when the single ""Real Blues"" was released, built around a vocal sample of Texas bluesman Lightnin' Hopkins and balafon. It turns out that even in his reinvention, much remains from St Germain's previous work; now, rather than dig for rare groove jazz for his source material, he's dug into the music of Mali.</p>
<p>He is landing on well-trod territory: Since 2000, any number of western musicians have traveled to Mali, to the sub-Sahara, or elsewhere in western Africa to collaborate with artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5199-tinariwen/"">Tinariwen</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/247-amadou-mariam/"">Amadou &amp; Mariam</a>. Musicians like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"">Damon Albarn</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"">Santigold</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>' Nick Zinner, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>'s Nels Cline, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a>, Amp Fiddler, and more have already sought this fusion. Navarre did well to draw on the talents of kora player Mamadou Cherif Soumano and the fleet-fingered guitarist Guimba Kouyate, as well as Brazilian percussionist Jorge Bezerra, whose polyrhythms at the end of ""Voila"" make for a subtle blend of the two continents. Bezerra also helps move ""Family Tree"" out of the sluggish piano opening to something far more enticing by song's end.</p>
<p>But the most interesting results on the album seem as if they could easily exist without Navarre's so-called ""French Touch."" Perhaps if Navarre had returned circa 2007, these hybrids would sound revelatory. But much like his fellow countrymen Daft Punk did in <i>RAM</i>, he has dismissed loops and sampling out of hand for something more ""organic"" and ""real"", and in the process he has turned his back on his greatest strength. The result sounds like something that's already been comp'ed to death by Putumayo.</p></div>"|21150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21150-st-germain/|6.0|Andy Beta

Even when the band became more elaborate for their 2011 full-length debut, both by adding samples and entering extended psychedelic tangents, Cottrell remained the focus of the action and attention. Each song felt like a setup for her arrival, as Windhand methodically followed another set of doom or stoner instructions. Maybe it’s the group’s tube-amp buzz, but something about the relationship has long suggested a colony of worker bees, preparing the hive for its rightful queen.</p>
<p>But this approach—and Cottrell, specifically—got lost on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18418-windhand-soma/""><i>Soma</i></a>, the disappointing 2013 album that once seemed as if it might signal Windhand’s move toward the masses. Nearly from start to finish, Cottrell fought against the sounds surrounding her. The band suddenly subsumed the leader, presenting itself less as a support squad and more as the new star. Bass overran Cottrell on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rSWN3Bm8WE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Orchard""</a>, and the riffs wouldn’t step out of her way for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC0MQog6Omg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Woodbine""</a>. During the record’s two-song, 45-minute closing sequence, the band swallowed her almost entirely. Sure, the riffs, rhythms, and solos were competent and sometimes even captivating, but if you’re an idiomatic doom band signed to one of metal’s biggest labels, you’d hope so, right? Windhand overrode their best asset.</p>
<p><i>Grief’s Infernal Flower</i>, Windhand’s third album and first with power producer Jack Endino, reverts to the strength of Cottrell and the songs themselves. The shift is apparent as soon as the drums and guitars lock into a march at the start of opener ""Two Urns"". Cottrell’s presentation—cool, collected, sinister—sits just above the surface of the still-roaring band. This time, she guides the action rather than being trapped inside the self-aggrandizing tumult. During the first eight minutes of <i>Grief’s Infernal Flower</i>, Windhand land a very deep hook, something they rarely accomplished across <i>Soma</i>’s 70 minutes. They even creep toward the economy and impact of alternative rock with ""Crypt Key"", a five-minute bruiser whose instant chorus suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a> with a big, burdensome case of the blues and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a>-sized backline. Windhand’s performances are direct without being simple here. The band and Endino take care to fold the layers of sound beneath or around Cottrell, never above her. </p>
<p>This directness carries over to Cottrell’s two solo numbers, too, both of which are more concise and less cloaked than her lone acoustic turn from <i>Soma</i>. The wonderfully frail ""Sparrow"" ponders the space between eternal devotion and the disappointment that mortality inevitably brings. You can imagine it as an antediluvian tune Harry Smith might have collected <i>or</i> a number fit for Windhand’s vintage guitar vortex—a testament to Cottrell’s command of songs when she’s given space to sing them.</p>
<p>Despite Windhand’s emphasis on economy, the quintet hasn’t given up on its love of at-length indulgence and improvisation just yet. For the finale, they pair two 14-minute tracks, each ending with a slow, steady, psych rock march. There are extended solos in both, the tones bending and fluttering into surreal patterns. During ""Kingfisher"", Windhand hover in a half-acoustic, half-electric haze, suggesting folk rock lost on a narcotic trip. Still, even as the jam lurches ahead, the singer and the song seem in control, as Cottrell judiciously delivers her sermons at the start and in the middle. She then slips into the background, as if dispatching the band to do her bidding. Likewise, Cottrell drifts in and out of ""Hesperus"", appearing, disappearing, and reappearing only to counter electric miasmas with arching melismas. Even when she’s quiet, Cottrell is now in control.</p>
<p>Early this year, Cottrell released <a href=""https://forcefieldrecords.bandcamp.com/album/s-t"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a self-titled set of solo recordings</a>. With her voice multi-tracked and manipulated, she sang 11 rather simple folk-and-blues songs over her own acoustic accompaniment. The sound was lovely, yes, but the effort felt listless and inward, as if a tape recorder had just happened to catch these back-porch performances on the wind. The hesitation mirrored <i>Soma. </i>But making and issuing that album, released the same month Windhand cut <i>Grief’s Infernal Flower</i>, must have galvanized Cottrell’s role as a capable singer able to command an entire enterprise. She expresses no hesitation here, and for that, her band has never sounded better. Sure, you can come for the twin guitars and the loaded rhythm section, but at last, Cottrell has made it clear you’re staying for her.</p></div>"|21054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21054-griefs-infernal-flower/|7.8|Grayson Haver Currin

The scene put a new spin on an old bad dream: Not only had Welsh shown up to class without clothes on, but the classroom had become a baseball field and everyone on it was a little bit drunk.</p>
<p>After a couple of dumb jokes (the packing peanuts of any good showman), Welsh canvassed the audience for requests and ended up singing an a capella version of an already startlingly intimate song called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15383-majical-cloudz-bugs-dont-buzz/"">""Bugs Don't Buzz""</a> from the band's 2013 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18042-majical-cloudz-impersonator/""><i>Impersonator</i></a> (""If life could be forever one instant/ Would it be the moment you met me? No, my love"").</p>
<p>For some bands, the moment might've constituted disaster, but for Majical Cloudz it was a logical endpoint to their music, which functions as a kind of emotional strip show: Welsh knows it's a performance but he still ends up naked. When the song was over, the crowd clapped with embarrassed hesitation: Should we be watching this? And should Welsh be doing it?</p>
<p>The band's new album, <i>Are You Alone?, </i>picks up where <i>Impersonator </i>left off: Stark, ethereal instrumentals buoyed by Welsh's unflinching voice. Musically, their roots are in English romantics like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"">Depeche Mode</a>, themselves a moody electronic gloss on the <i>lieder </i>that composers like Franz Schubert were writing 150 years earlier. Philosophically, they chart a junction of new age and hardcore punk, both of which prize a radical scraping away of excess in their search for truth. Majical Cloudz want empathy and they want it <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>I call them a ""band"" but should note how they stretch the definition of the word. As a singer, Welsh performs with the confidence and intimacy of someone holding a hairbrush in front of their bedroom mirror<span>—</span>the music is mostly in his head. His counterpart, Matthew Otto, is less visible but equally important. A former student in an electroacoustic studies program that emphasized sound design as much as composition, Otto doesn't try and approximate backing musicians so much as create vapor trails where backing musicians might've stood. If the name Majical Cloudz has any bearing on their sound, it's because of him: He's the air Welsh breathes.</p>
<p><i>Alone</i> is less stripped-down than <i>Impersonator</i>, but it feels less confrontational, too. The band recently went on tour opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"">Lorde</a>, and seem to have figured out how to broaden their sound while softening it at the same time, all without losing the detonating high that made <i>Impersonator</i> so remarkable. Songs like ""So Blue"" and ""Downtown""—both standouts—are easy to imagine as more fully fleshed out pieces of music, conveying size without occupying space. Like photographic negatives, you can still see the image but the inversion of blacks and whites lends it a kind of alien melancholy.</p>
<p>Like <i>Impersonator</i>, <i>Alone</i> is a sad album, but its sadness is a kind of tall tale, the details of which are overblown for dramatic effect. At times its lyrics sound less like expressions of personal darkness than advertisements for darkness in general, written in lettering so big you could read it from the highway. In a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/majical-cloudz/"">interview</a> with Pitchfork, he professed his admiration for Andy Kaufman, an artist usually classified as a comedian but whose work tends to function more like social performance art. The connection makes sense: Like Kaufman, Welsh tends to scramble performance and sincerity, laying himself bare in a way that seems more honest when he's onstage than it might in so-called real life. At peak he becomes a kind of Puberty Incarnate, bearer of feelings so awkward and yet so incandescent that they seem like a joke and a dare at the same time.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I blew off part of an afternoon to see the Pixar movie <i>Inside Out</i>, which follows the inner life of a young girl named Riley as personified by five fundamental emotions: joy, fear, anger, disgust, and sadness. The emotions—characters unto themselves—run around Riley's head jockeying for control, turning each new experience into a color-coded orb later filed away in Riley's labyrinthine memory.</p>
<p>Early on, Sadness—a dumpy, self-effacing Midwestern woman—is portrayed as a kind of negative-force King Midas, unwittingly ruining Riley's memories by turning them a cool, melancholy blue. The movie's revelation is when Joy—cannily represented as part-Tinkerbell, part passive-aggressive control freak—starts to realize that Sadness isn't a threat to Riley but a necessary catalyst for her growth, not a barrier to Joy but a bridge. Toward the end, a new feeling pops out of Riley's psychological conveyor belt: The yellow of Joy and the blue of Sadness, swirled together like ribbons inside a marble.</p>
<p>The moral is simple, but in a culture obsessed by happiness, it seems surprising, too: Maybe sadness isn't just an O.K. feeling to have, but an essential part of our emotional balance. Without it, we live in monochrome.</p>
<p>I kept thinking of Majical Cloudz, whose music—like <i>Inside Out—</i>seems to recast sadness as a feeling that doesn't damage the self but helps keep it whole. Now, when I see that album title (<i>Are You Alone?</i>), it seems less like a grim rhetorical question than an invitation—the kind of thing you might ask someone who <i>is</i> alone but looks like they could use a little company.</p></div>"|21194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21194-are-you-alone/|8.0|Mike Powell

The first mix begins with lyrical Norwegian jazz and the third mix concludes with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a>'s ""Baby's Arms""; along the way, we're treated to Spanish guitar, Balearic ambient, '70s Europop, French/African electronic music, dub techno, acid, deep house, Detroit techno, Swedish space rock, Italian synth pop, and a conceptual artist's <a href=""http://www.apparent-extent.com/index.php?id=130"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a>'s ""This Is How We Walk on the Moon"". It's the kind of mix you might plan a dinner party around, but beware—somewhere in the middle stretch, there will be dancing on tables, and it will probably be barefoot.</p>
<p>Thomas is known for his eclecticism, so the range isn't surprising. What <i>is</i> surprising is how seamlessly it flows. Even his oddest selections seem designed to seduce, and whether he's riding the mix hard—one <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"">Ricardo Villalobos</a> track weaves in and out for nearly 20 minutes—or simply playing out songs in full, his sleight-of-hand skills are such that you never really notice the changes.</p>
<p>Disc one begins with jazz, detours through groovy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZPqz7mIEM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">funk rock</a>, and then stretches out to explore all manner of sounds you might have heard Ibiza's DJ Alfredo spinning in the early '90s. A five- or six-song stretch of chilly drum machines, slow-motion acid, and world-music accents that climaxes in A Split - Second's chugging <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThKc8DVVcj0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New Beat</a> is particularly inspired; it seems to open up a kind of wormhole in time and space, collapsing multiple places and eras into a single idea. As for the tranquil denouement, Kurt Vile and that Arthur Russell cover may be notable talking points, but the most remarkable find here might be Il Guardiano del Faro's ""Ma Ci Pensi, Io E Te"", an Italian easy-listening song from 1980 that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a> at the Ice Capades.</p>
<p>Those are a few of the highlights, anyway; every listener will doubtless pick up on different moments. The sheer volume of material, combined with Thomas' knack for teasing out a given tonal or rhythmic idea across long stretches begins to lend repeated listens a kind of hallucinatory air. <i>Where am I? Didn't I just hear this? Does this stairway lead up or down?</i> It's rare that a mix so accurately replicates the sense of disorientation that you get from a marathon stretch of clubbing, but on <i>Paradise Goulash</i>, the windows are blacked out, you can't find your friends, who knows what time (or day) it is, and you wouldn't have it any other way.</p></div>"|21088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21088-paradise-goulash/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

Spinn, born Morris Harper, has been pressing energetic, beguiling footwork onto record for decades, even if only a fraction of those releases have featured his name on the title. Back in the '90s, he dropped tracks on cassette with longtime collaborator and Teklife co-founder, the late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a>. He squeezed through the closing doors of vaunted ghetto house label <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20205-dance-mania-ghetto-madness/"">Dance Mania</a> before it shuttered in the early '00s, releasing a raw, crackling track in 1998 called ""Mutha Fuc*a"" that Dance Mania <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/dj-rashad-dj-spinn-windy-city-boom"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">misattributed to DJ Thadz</a>. He also had a hand in eight of the 14 songs on Rashad's masterpiece, 2013's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18627-dj-rashad-double-cup/"">Double Cup</a>,</i> and this year alone appeared on a slew of Teklife and Rashad-related releases.</p>
<p>Spinn's lack of marquee status often seems due to his eagerness to work with others, but he finally takes center stage on <i>Off That Loud</i>. It's his first solo release since Rashad passed away in April 2014, and the EP comes during a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20782-rp-boo-fingers-bank-pads-shoe-prints/"">particularly</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20450-dark-energy/"">rich year</a> for footwork. Massive opener ""Throw It Back"" delivers megaton drops between scorching acid synths and sprightly, rapid-fire kicks. Footwork remains a niche concern—Planet Mu honcho <a href=""https://www.dummymag.com/lists/planet-mu-20th-anniversary-best-tracks-according-to-mike-paradinas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mike Paradinas recently told <i>Dummy Magazine</i></a> footwork albums sell so poorly he can only afford to drop two a year—but ""Throw It Back"" could chameleon its way onto a playlist of arena-sized EDM songs as easily as it could provide a soundtrack for dancers facing off at Battlegroundz on Chicago's South Side.</p>
<p>Spinn handles two of the EP's four tracks on his own—""The Future Is Now"", with its cross-stitching rhythms, is the hardest of the four, and the title track marries rich Rhodes organ with sputtering vocal samples and twitching patterns of percussion. But the best of the bunch is a tune Spinn made with Rashad, the previously released ""Dubby"", which showcases the pair's penchant for experimentation while keeping footwork grounded in its idiosyncratic pulse. Spinn and Rashad marry jungle breaks to footwork's syncopated drum and bass, and then pass the mic to <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a>, who raps: ""I don't know 'bout where you from but this is how my hood work."" Brown's squawk has colored downtrodden tales about growing up in Detroit, but he sounds utterly at home on ""Dubby"". As Spinn adeptly blends foreign sounds into a distinctly Chicago genre, <i>Off That Loud</i> shows his ability to help footwork thrive outside its birthplace. Spinn earned his veteran bona fides years ago, but <i>Off That Loud</i> feels like a new beginning.</p></div>"|21018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21018-off-that-loud-ep/|7.3|Leor Galil

It ends with ""Stay"". The thematic focus on idleness befits the Mantles' breezy but rickety pop, and though the lyrics rarely despair, <i>All Odds End </i>is nevertheless saturated with a quiet, interior melancholy.</p>
<p>The Mantles, who formed in the mid-'00s, first garnered notice with their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13796-the-mantles/"">eponymous 2009 debut</a>. The record mediated indie-pop, pastoral '60s psych, and the various locales known for jangling in the 1980s, all liberally swathed in tape machine gauze. Along with the Siltbreeze connection, the production pegged the Mantles as ""lo-fi,"" a reductive category that was particularly ill-fitting in their case. After a downtick in output following the turn of the decade, 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18115-the-mantles-long-enough-to-leave/""><i>Long Enough to Leave </i></a>reaffirmed what the Mantles always sounded like: a band besotted with too many disciples of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a> to list but defined by its immutable eccentricities.  </p>
<p>That's even more so the case with <i>All Odds End, </i>where Olivares' ragged vocal melodies stumble between notes, emphasizing flair and character over the conventions of pitch. If on earlier material Olivares risked overstraining his delivery, here he's more settled, inclined to deadpan instead of whimper a snappy phrase for effect. Meanwhile, the expanded lineup augments his voice with greater presence and texture. It's still scrappy—with cymbals that fall like trashcan lids and an overall reverence for basic root notes—but while the Mantles continue to prize sparseness and restraint, <i>All Odds End </i>sounds especially confident in that decision. Many indie pop songs endear with their sense of delicate, precarious construction, but here the individually shambolic parts coalesce into a substantial whole. <i>All Odds End </i>suggests an ensemble of players who don't <i>need</i> to hold back; they choose to, together.</p>
<p>Olivares' metaphors for resisting change and liminal places usually have a lackadaisical tone, but the lyrical focus connects to how the band has drifted toward anachronism. Many of the Mantles' early regional peers have dissolved or resettled in L.A.—which ""Best Sides"" deals with in veiled terms—and the group never demonstrated much interest in consistent release schedules, touring, or otherwise playing the indie career game. Indeed, as Oakland and San Francisco undergo rapid and reckless redevelopment, it's easy to hear <i>All Odds End </i>as a defensive retreat inward, an attempt to suspend time. As a futile endeavor in reality, it's sad. As a listening experience, it's effective.</p></div>"|21032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21032-all-odds-end/|7.5|Sam Lefebvre

They play melodic black metal that isn't immediate in its beauty, though a dark elegance does surface. <a href=""https://no-solace.bandcamp.com/album/groza-lp-2008"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Groza</i></a>, which they released in 2008, was a promising debut, and on 2012's <a href=""https://no-solace.bandcamp.com/album/with-hearts-toward-none-lp-2012"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>With Hearts Toward None</i></a> they began to come into their own in terms of composition and lyrics. <i>Exercises in Futility</i>, their third full-length, improves upon <i>Hearts</i>' template, with guitarist/vocalist Mikołaj ""M."" Żentara and drummer Maciej ""Darkside"" Kowalski delivering their most spirited performances to date. It doesn't just set the standard for black metal in their home country, it's one of the finest black metal albums this year.</p>
<p>As its title implies, <i>Futility</i> is focused on a pessimistic, defeatist worldview. The opening line is ""The great truth is there isn't one,"" a tone-setter if there ever was one. If we're to believe them, Mgła would prefer to be in hell shouting at the devil, not the purgatory of life. As M. laments on ""II"": ""I wish it was classic fire and brimstone/ But clearly there is a very special plan/ Paved with havoc and shattered virtues/ As if there were any other paths."" <i>Futility</i>'s lyrics are a cut above basic sadboy depressive tropes, especially in a section of ""V"" masked as an ode to the working class: ""Blessed be the tailors, the masks are cut to fit/ Blessed be the woodworkers, the crosses and the gallows/ Blessed be the forgers of iron, and the spikes and the barbwire/ Blessed be the stone cutters, it took a quarry to bury the dreams.""</p>
<p>They're lyrics don't offer much hope, but M.'s guitar work suggests anything but failure: his playing draws from metal's wells of depression as well as the affirmative lights that can coexist with it. Mgła are the true heirs to Dissection's style of black metal; the melodies are huge without dipping into the saccharine. Even when M. gets into his nastiest playing, it never feels like he's wading in the tar pits of despair for despair's sake.</p>
<p>Mgła also balance their bursts of nihilistic euphoria with mid-paced sections that show discipline without sacrificing majesty. ""II"" uses this contrast as a springboard—the slower melody naturally builds into the brighter, faster vortex where hypnotism is a means of getting towards something bigger, not an end unto itself. ""V"" is another master study in these shifts—the slower sections are their darkest grooves, and when they race off, they run farther and faster than anything on the record. You imagine the duo would hate to be compared to post-rock, but both post-rock and black metal also-rans could stand to learn a lot about dynamics from them. Mgła's emphasis on the mid-paced is one testament to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22778-celtic-frost/"">Celtic Frost</a>'s continued influence on black metal; it also lets the beauty of the riffs exfoliate, and those who got into black metal for its prettier, more accessible side would find much to appreciate here.</p>
<p>M.'s riffwork puts Mgła above most black metal groups, but it's Darkside's drumming that launches them into a class of their own. His cymbal work is key, bringing with it a formidable delicacy. ""II"" begins with a drum fill that serves as Darkside's own mini-suite, with the rides and crashes pinging louder than his tom fills. Maybe it's because we're not used to hearing cymbals used so prominently that they resonate this much; Darkside sees his kit as an extension of M.'s melodic prowess and not just an anger-management tool. Where most black metal drummers focus the most energy on bass drums or snares, he transfers that intensity towards guiding cymbals into a nervous dance. On ""V"", M.'s ecstatic melody becomes a light of rapture with Darkside's touch, elevating what's already seemingly in the heavens. Across <i>Futility</i>, he brings detail you'd expect from a solo project headed by drum-focused multi-instrumentalists like Leviathan or Panopticon.</p>
<p>It's rare to see two players so clearly meant for each other, and Mgła's accomplished performance on <i>Futility</i> transforms the lyrical content into a call to action. Great metal can harness strength from hopelessness; turning that strength into art is a blustering triumph. ""The great truth is there isn't one"" may be a swift roundhouse, but it's one that it will sober you up to find your own purpose. And on ""IV"", M. howls ""Every empire/ Every nation/ Every tribe/ Thought it would end/ In a bit more decent way,"" a sentiment that can be applied to more than the collapse of states; it's the radical acceptance that there is no such thing as a clean break. No, <i>Futility</i> doesn't sell you the promise of a better world taken like gummy vitamins. But by offering no promises, it does open you up to take control for yourself, and what's more positive than that?</p></div>"|21052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21052-mgla-exercises-in-futility/|7.8|Andy O'Connor

But other than that, he seemed serene: ""<span>Fifteen years I spent proving myself,"" he mused in that same piece. ""</span><span>The only reason for me to make a record now is to make the record."" Accordingly, </span> after the grotty, pissed-off <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17966-deerhunter-monomania/"">Monomania</a></i> and Cox's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57723-bradford-cox-hospitalized-after-being-hit-by-car/"">catastrophic car accident</a> comes Deerhunter's most content, warm and plainspoken work to date.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Cox drew an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61414-deerhunter-create-interactive-fading-frontier-influences-map/"">""influence map""</a> for this record, one which included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a>, Tom Petty, and INXS. All of these names together clarify something about Cox's intentions: <b></b>These are amongst the most agreeable rock artists to ever become stars, and <i>Fading Frontier</i> sounds like Deerhunter attempting to create songs that are equally enjoyable in an objective way as ""Free Fallin'"" or ""Need You Tonight"" or ""The One I Love""—ones where if you hear them in a restaurant or car or house party, no one will ever ask you to turn them off.  While Deerhunter's created a number of indelible songs over their career, <i>Fading Frontier</i> may have their first that could conceivably blend into real-deal classic rock radio.</p>
<p>Deerhunter reunite with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14681-halcyon-digest/"" target=""_blank""><i>Halcyon Digest</i></a> producer Ben H. Allen, who forgoes his trademark aquatic ambience and booming low-end to approximate the embossed sound of Jeff Lynne or Scott Litt on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17673-deerhunter-breaker/"" target=""_blank"">""Breaker""</a> and ""Living My Life"". Even compared to the contemporary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs"" target=""_blank"">indie</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands/"" target=""_blank"">rock</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches"" target=""_blank"">elite</a> working with late-'80s pop-rock at the moment, <i>Fading Frontier</i> sounds happily centrist. Opener ""All the Same"" shares a title with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqIp5Pqt9wc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song</a>, as well as their chiming, interlocked guitars and chipper melodic resolutions. The waltz-timed number with tinny drum machine and slide guitar also happens to share <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZxrIbTMJr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a title</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"">Beach House</a> (""Take Care""). These are crisp and professional recordings, midtempo strides with cleanly strummed open chords, broad harmonies and hooks, unbeholden to any particular subgenre or time period. Meanwhile, the harpsichord and high-capoed guitars of ""Duplex Planet"" and ""Carrion"" show a clearheaded psychedelic side of Deerhunter that's more Paisley Underground than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground"">Velvet Underground</a>.</p>
<p>Cox has called<i> Fading Frontier</i><span> his ""domestic"" record, but you shouldn't expect a facade of contentment: ""All the Same"" finds Cox turning his attention to a friend's father, who ""changed his sex and had no more"" out of boredom and loses his wife, kids and will to live as a result. Meanwhile, the foggy ambience of ""Take Care"" parts to reveal Cox singing about burnt dry ice and rotting corpses. The title is not a tender promise, it's a sarcastic, suicidal salutation. Even if Cox hadn't spent much of the past year in recovery, <i>Fading Frontier </i>would likely still obsess over mortality; this <i>is</i> a Deerhunter record, after all, and so we end up with sturdy, industrious pop-rock songs about creeping death, survival and revival. Cox has urged us not to confuse ""I"" with me,"" but  has spent a significant portion of his life in and out of hospitals, and both ""Snakeskin"" and ""Duplex Planet"" feel inspired by his convalescence."" I don't ever want to go back again to the old folks' home,"" he sighs on the latter, and it feels like an echo of the riddle he posed on </span><i>Halcyon Digest's </i><span>""Basement Scene,'"" where he claimed, ""I don't want to get old"" </span><i>and </i><span>""I want to get old"".</span></p>
<p>Perhaps he did mean both.  Note the play on words of the closer ""Carrion"", or hell, the double meaning of ""remains"". If it doesn't initially seem like there's as much at stake as there was on <i>Halcyon Digest </i>or the singleminded commitment of <i>Monomania, </i><i>Fading Frontier </i>is Cox reckoning with the dissonance of being relatively young man of 33 with a band who's already in legacy-building phase<i>. </i>But the tough talk on ""Snakeskin"" comes from someone whose mere physicality is considered a major health risk and confrontational by default (""I was born already nailed to the cross""). If there isn't a Deerhunter <i>sound</i>, there's a Deerhunter <i>perspective </i>that runs through their work, best summed up in ""All the Same""—""take your handicaps/ Channel them and feed them back/ Until they become your strengths."" The weird era continues.</p></div>"|21039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21039-fading-frontier/|8.4|Ian Cohen

By the time Hood finishes expounding on various histories—social, economic, cultural—of his beloved Lauderdale County, the reason for his very un-rock 'n' roll professorial digression becomes clear: sometimes a story can’t be told in just a song.</p>
<p>There are two or three moments like this at every Drive-By Truckers concert, when Patterson Hood the storyteller interrupts Patterson Hood the songwriter, cramming background information that his songs—novelistic in detail, cinematic in scope—can’t quite contain on their own. That’s because at their heart, the Drive-By Truckers are a storytelling band. It’s easy enough to compare Hood to a prolific novelist and Cooley to a modernist poet, but most of their songs could just easily be labeled: <span>based on a true story.</span><span> That’s the central tenet of the Hood and Cooley’s indignant premise when they first started the Drive-By Truckers in the post-grunge mid-late 90’s: the idea that a young scrappy band can write heroic songs about their grandparents. Why look further than that?</span></p>
<p>The stories collected on <span><i>It’s Great to be Alive!</i>, </span><span>the sprawling, three-plus hour document of the Drive-By Truckers’ 2014 three-night stand at San Francisco’s Fillmore Auditorium,</span><span>are tall-tales mumbled by friends at the bar, family legends passed on through generations, anecdotes from neighbors romanticized and made grand. As such, a Drive-By Truckers concert can feel like a punk staging of the Southern oral tradition that takes place on front-porches and in rocking chairs. Hood and Cooley act out the role of grizzled elders with countless tales up their sleeve, taking turns swapping their story-songs without any semblance of a setlist. That’s why Truckers shows can also be occasionally exhausting: Sometimes you might just not be in the mood to hear Grandpa Hood launch into that seven minute story about Mary Alice and her chemo treatments again.</span></p>
<p>This is hardly the first live record the Truckers has released in its near 20-year history. It is, however, the first time the band has tried to faithfully replicate what it feels like to attend a Drive-By Truckers concert. The material, which spans from “Runaway Train”, a song by the pre-Truckers late-80’s incarnation Adam’s House Cat, to a half-dozen selections from last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18972-drive-by-truckers-english-oceans/"" target=""_blank""><i>English Oceans</i></a><span>, is performed by the slimmer, five-piece lineup the band has used since 2012, after various departures, firings and lineup changes. On stage the band has reworked much of its back-catalogue to fit its current streamlined incarnation, which has grown more sophisticated and elegant in the studio as of late (their last few records contain more piano and banjo than distorted guitar feedback). An unhinged rant like “Sink Hole” is now a precise polemic, whereas the mournful pedal-steel coda to “A Ghost to Most” is now a freewheeling, two-guitar improvisation. The modern-day Truckers are particularly good at such shape-shifting, switching from sloppy to stately from one song to the next.</span></p>
<p><i>It’s Great to be Alive!</i> <span>is the sound of a veteran band in complete command of its back-catalog. “Box of Spiders” is reimagined as a country-soul centerpiece, another song that gains multitudes when prefaced with Hood’s four minute story about his relatives. “Sounds Better In The Song” is a revelation in its prickly full-band arrangement, and “The Living Bubba,” Hood’s ode to a stubborn musician slowly dying of AIDS, sounds more moving with each passing year, an anthem of persistence and survival for a road-weary band still chugging on.</span></p>
<p>A carefully curated setlist can go a long way, and the tracklisting here benefits a great deal from some post-hoc sequencing. Tales of defeat and struggle promptly segue into stories of defiance and hope. Soul ballads bleed into rockabilly raves. A song like “Goode’s Field Road” is followed by “Uncle Frank”. Although Cooley’s “Uncle Frank” takes place more than 50 years before Hood’s “Goode’s Field Road”, the two stories may nearly be identical: North Alabama tragedies filled with depression and heartless bureaucracy that conclude with suicide. The one-two pairing serves as a quiet, powerful comment on Southern change and progress, or lack thereof. Like the best live records, <i>It’s Great to be Alive!</i><span> is a carefully curated document that does a great job pretending to be a raw, unfettered documentation of a single night.</span></p>
<p>As its partially sarcastic, partially dead-serious title suggests, <span><i>It’s Great to be Alive!</i> </span><span>serves as a pointed testament to the Drive-By Truckers’ longevity and continuing relevance. A little less than half of the songs on the record come from the band’s post-Jason Isbell period, from their 2008 subtle masterwork </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11080-brighter-than-creations-dark/"" target=""_blank""><i>Brighter Than Creation’s Dark</i></a><span> onward. The subtle interpersonal drama in recent songs like  “Primer Coat” and “Mercy Buckets” are every bit as urgent as older, anthemic statements like “Tornadoes” and “Women Without Whiskey”. Musicians will forever insist that their more recent work holds up alongside their classic material. </span><i>It’s Great to be Alive!</i><span> is proof that the Drive-By Truckers’ discography is the rare case where such wishful thinking actually proves true.</span></p>
<p>“Tell me another story,” Cooley sings towards the very beginning of their latest live record. “Tell me about the lows and the highs.” The Drive-By Truckers spend the rest of <i>It’s Great to be Alive!</i><span> proving that they’ve always honored that modest request better than anyone.</span></p></div>"|21083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21083-its-great-to-be-alive/|8.0|Jonathan Bernstein

They've kept moving, which is admirable, but when the Savannah, Ga., band started out, they were already unique: a crusty sludge-punk juggernaut that mixed shout-along male-female vocals into anthems that got your adrenaline going even if you weren't paying attention to what they were saying. As time went on, they added a second drummer, and replaced some of the sludge with pop. They mentioned Built to Spill as an influence, as well as early '90s alt rock and riot grrrl. Vocalist/guitarist Phillip Cope included Beach House and Sleepy Sun on a year-end list. The thing is, as much as they tweaked the metal formula, and copped to quieter listening habits, they still basically sounded the same: even on 2013’s chillier, darker, atmospherically expansive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18057-kylesa-ultraviolet/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ultraviolet</i></a>, Kylesa barreled along like Kylesa, but in a slightly less interesting way.</p>
<p>Which is what makes their new, self-produced seventh album, <i>Exhausting Fire</i>, unique to the trio’s catalogue: On these 10 songs, Cope, guitarist/vocalist Laura Pleasants, and drummer Carl McGinley often sound like a different band entirely. The Cope-fronted “Moving Day” is a mid-tempo death rock song that fits nicely between Killing Joke and Christian Death on a mix tape, and stands out as one of my favorite individual songs of the year. Previously, when Kylesa weren't speeding along, they'd stall. When they got too ambitious, you'd wish they'd get back to packing basements. It's not that anything was offensive or embarrassing—it was just bland. </p>
<p>Here, they’ve sharpened their songwriting on tracks that don’t immediately sound like Kylesa, so you get a nice mix of the familiar fist-pumpers along with curious diversions that work. ""Lost and Confused"" goes from spaced-out mellow to fist-pumping shout-along, then elegantly keeps the pedal pressed to the floor until an atmospheric coda. It's a geat song, one that's inspired a lot of air drumming at my desk this week. Or the amped-up, smeary ""Inward Debate"", which shows them subtly working deeper psychedelia into the double-drumming. On the longest track, ""Shaping the Southern Sky"", the band drifts from rock 'n' roll boogie into a cavernous desert of Meat Puppets tumble weeds that builds, over 2 minutes, to a massive rock punch that's worth the wait. Importantly, on the previously mentioned “Moving Day”, you hear Kylesa crafting a legitimate hook, one that could close a John Hughes movie.</p>
<p>There's a lot that echoes the Pixies here, perhaps because on <i>Exhausting</i>, there’s more of a mix between the vocalists: Pleasants handled most of the singing on <i>Ultraviolet</i>, or at least Cope took a backseat, shouting choruses now and then. She has more range than Cope in a traditional sense, but her voice isn’t that compelling alone—you ultimately need his chanted intonations against her spacier tones to keep things interesting. When they both shout, it's golden; they do that a lot here. And, often when you think a song's boring (see: ""Growing Roots""), the other singer joins in and saves the day.</p>
<p>Some can't be saved, which happens when you keep expanding. The first movement of opener ""Crusher"" feels like a hangover from <i>Ultraviolet, </i>and the nighttime psychedelia of “Falling” limps along for 4 minutes. More often than not, though, the center holds, and it makes <i>Ultraviolet</i> look like a scratchpad for what they ended up doing here: radically shaking up their formula—from the inside out—and coming back with compelling results.</p></div>"|21186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21186-exhausting-fire/|7.4|Brandon Stosuy

Since their start in 1991, Clutch have amassed a global reputation as the platonic ideal of stoner rock, with frontman Neil Fallon regarded as one of rock’s most talented auteurs. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"" target=""_blank"">Baroness</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lopandemic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lo-Pan</a>, they’re not afraid to roll up their sleeves and crank out a filthy blues jam (1998’s <i>The Elephant Riders </i>more than gives the Black Keys a run for their money), but the band does so with a cartoonish flippancy that their peers lack, which in turn injects the genre with a much-needed sense of humor. “I have a great luxury that I'm a professional liar—that's what a storyteller is,” Fallon said in the album's press release, going on to add, ""It's the one socially acceptable way to completely deceive people, and that's what they want.” Liars tell the best tales, for sure – and when they're packing guitars, all the better.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Where Brent Hinds and company purvey <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5143-leviathan/"" target=""_blank"">AP lit-inspired epics</a> and extensive experimentations in genre, Fallon and his partners have but the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCSFwGy9gQY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">boogie</a> and the <a href=""https://youtu.be/qWXzLZSNkDI?t=1m6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bellylaugh</a>—and in the hands of this foursome, that’s more than enough. Clutch’s last record, 2013’s <i>Earth Rocker, </i>marked their biggest triumph to date: a playful, occasionally psychedelic LP that wasn’t afraid to go prog once in a while (it’s also one of the best driving albums in recent memory). <i>Psychic Warfare</i>, recorded in Texas and produced by Machine (who manned the boards for both <i>Earth Rocker </i>and 2004’s  <i>Blast Tyrant</i>) isn’t as overachieving, instead marking a return to the bluesy, boozy rock of their early catalog. </p>
<p class=""p1"">After a nondescript intro, <i>Psychic Warfare </i>starts with one of the band’s strongest songs to date: “X Ray Visions”, an ode to conspiracy theories, drugs, sex, and horoscopes all rolled into one. Over the span of three-and-a-half minutes, Fallon manages to incorporate visits from Republican apparitions (tapping out a telegram in a motel room, he’s “quickly overtaken by the angry spirits of Ronald and Nancy Reagan”), a raucous refrain that renders quacky sci-fi concepts like “x ray visions” and “energy weapons” undeniably badass, and the best musical role-call since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9jTnxv0RU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sweet’s “Ballroom Blitz”</a> (when’s the last time <i>you</i> introduced yourself as “on the mic…SCORPIOOOOOOOO!”?). It’s a contender for one of the best hard rock songs to date, so it’s unfortunate that the rest of the album–except, perhaps, the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qfIecwXFg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Highway Star”</a>-cribbing “Firebirds!”–fails to capture that divine, batshit energy, despite Fallon’s tales of supernatural lust (“Sucker For The Witch”), cyclops’ revenge (“Behold the Colossus”), decapitated bodies and three-legged mules (“Decapitation Blues”). </p>
<p class=""p1"">Perhaps it’s the abundance of one-three-five chord progressions, or the scarcity of skyward solos (although “Noble Savage” is a shoe-in for <i>Rock Band 4</i>) – or maybe “X Ray Visions” is just a hell of an act to follow. Either way, <i>Psychic Warfare </i>settles into craggy cruise control by “Sucker For The Witch”: haggard verses festooned by Fallon’s goofy imagery and anchored by the no-bullshit percussion of drummer Jean-Paul Gaster and bassist Dan Maines, which in turn give way to stadium-ready choruses. Occasionally, they dip into Texan blues (“Our Lady of Electric Light”, “Son Of Virginia”) – a welcome bit of contrast that comes at the expense of lost momentum, with mid-album “Doom Saloon” being the worst offender.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Clutch work best when they keep the pulley of punchlines and pummeling riffs running at max speed, and as a result, <i>Psychic Warfare </i>proves a tad too meandering to eclipse <i>Earth Rocker </i>or <i>Blast Tyrant</i>. But guffaw, gawk, pump your fist you will—and in the self-important, super-serious world of heavy music, that’s worth more than you think.</p></div>"|20979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20979-psychic-warfare/|6.9|Zoe Camp

Consider <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30928-maya-jane-coles/"" target=""_blank"">Maya Jane Coles</a>, who first rose in the electronic scene making deep house. Her 2013 solo debut effort, <i>Comfort</i>, retreated from standard, four-on-the-floor, bringing in moody, rousing elements of trip hop and dubstep. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30090-george-fitzgerald/"" target=""_blank"">George Fitzgerald</a> made a similar departure with his debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20444-fading-love/"" target=""_blank"">Fading Love</a> </i>earlier this year, foregoing the instant likability of early singles ""I Can Tell (By the Way You Move),"" or the addictive depths of ""Magnetic"" for a more smoothed-over mood. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30522-cooly-g/"" target=""_blank"">Cooly G</a> (born Merrisa Campbell) seems to have fallen into this impulse as a delayed reaction. Her first two solo albums, the beautiful, righteous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16866-playin-me/"" target=""_blank""><i>Playin' Me</i></a> and the eerie and sensual <i>Wait 'Til Night</i>, were singer-songwriter experiments, ones in which Campbell used music as an outlet for and compliment to her sexual reawakening. Blending icy-cold synths with vulnerable lyrics, <span>she speaks profoundly to women within the electronic music scene, evoking </span>the simultaneous terror and power of long nights, either alone or in the comforting arms of a lover. It felt uncomfortable but necessary, the kind of sound you can’t immediately turn away from even if its complicated internal wiring is difficult to comprehend.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That is why it was frustrating to find Campbell pulling back the reins on herself – her openness, that now-signature rawness – while listening to the <i>Armz House</i> EP. This is the club-ready Cooly G of old. She<a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/16466-cooly-g-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> told the Quietus </a>recently that she wanted to find a way to work her vocals back into her club sets, and her solutions seems to treat them like another tool, mechanically inserted into the mix rather than front and center. Most times, her voice is barely perceptible: Her whispery coos appear for only a handful of seconds on ""Tippin B"" before they are overwhelmed by her pointed use of synths and drums. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Most of the time, this restraint pays off.  The addictive tension of album closer ""Horrors in the Dance"" sounds  like the pushing and tearing of strong muscles. Both <i>Playin' Me</i> and <i>Wait Til Night</i> were the sort of records one sits with alone rather than dances to, but <i>Armz House</i>, from its first few seconds, aims hard at dancing crowds while keeping the sensuality of her previous records. ""Booboo"" is a cheeky and energetic club banger featuring at least three vocal samples, echoing the energy and nimbleness of ""Horrors in the Dance"". If you arrive at <i>Armz House</i> expecting a journal of her emotions, you will be disappointed, but Campbell displays a mastery of her form here that's impossible not to admire. She pushes her songs to their limits and then pushes them a bit more, making complicated tracks sound and feel simple. Even if the results aren't as showy or bombastic as her peers, she still manages to ultimately make music that is, while not perfect, very fun. For dance music in 2015, that has become an increasingly rare feat.</p></div>"|21113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21113-armz-house-ep/|7.4|Britt Julious

But in their initial '80s iteration as CD-stacked behemoths, box sets were actually designed for the casual fan. The earliest paragons of the format—Bob Dylan's <i>Biograph</i>, David Bowie's <i>Sound+Vision</i>—presented expertly compiled overviews of a veteran artist, weaving in hit singles, choice album tracks, rarities and live cuts to form a chronological portrait of their evolution. Sure, they could be prohibitively expensive, but in the days before you could access everything through a YouTube deep dive, box sets made life easy. When faced with the prospect of schooling yourself on an artist 20 albums deep into their career, a three-disc round-up of the best stuff offered maximum return for the least hassle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So in that sense, there's something quaintly anachronistic about <i>Central Belters</i>, a three-disc (or six-LP) compendium celebrating 20 years of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a>. The Scottish art-rockers are ideal subjects for a box-set distillation—they've released eight proper albums, not to mention a handful of soundtracks and stand-alone EPs. They're the sort of reliable band—both in terms of line-up stability and rate of output—that's no doubt lost some old-school fans along the way, and picked up some new ones (2014's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18896-mogwai-rave-tapes/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rave Tapes</i></a> was their first album to crack the UK top 10), so both camps could benefit from a refresher on what they've missed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While Mogwai's means have changed over the years, the mood of their records has remained consistent. Pretty much every single Mogwai track resides somewhere on the spectrum between rainy-day melancholy and blood-boiling rage; the only laugh to be had in their discography is in the title of 2003's </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5367-happy-songs-for-happy-people/"" target=""_blank""><i>Happy Songs for Happy People</i></a><span>. But they've been so good at recreating that despairing atmosphere on an album-by-album basis, that it's easy to overlook how much they've actually deviated from their formative script. Mogwai are an instrumental band, except when they're not; they're noise-loving sonic sadists, except when they're being tenderly delicate; they're slowcore saddos, except when they're making motorik synth-pop. They're a band you think you know, until you realize you don't recognize them anymore.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Mogwai have evolved in baby steps—each of their records has yielded a track or two that opens up new avenues for the band, without radically altering their essence. But the quasi-chronological, best-of compilation that comprises </span><i>Central Belters</i><span><i>'</i> first two discs has the effect of making that transformation seem much more pronounced and dramatic. The set charts a mostly linear progression, from the stormy psychedelic surges of 1996 single ""Summer"" to last year's neon-tinted dream-pop anthem ""Teenage Exorcists"" (featuring Stuart Braithwaite's most unabashedly melodic vocal performance to date), but emphasizes the aesthetic outliers in their canon. On any given Mogwai record, the vocal tracks make up maybe 10 per cent of the tracklist; here, it's more like a third, lending this set a more vibrant energy than their albums proper.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Greatest-hits compilations in general are something of an endangered species, given that streaming-service playlists can now generate them for you, but there's still something to be said for getting a band's own take on what they deem essential. (To wit, the ""Intro to Mogwai"" mega-mix on Apple Music features 25 songs; only 12 of them are featured among </span><i>Central Belters</i><span>' 34 tracks.) For one, there's a conspicuous lack of tracks from 1997's </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11600-young-team-2008-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Young Team</i></a><span>, the album that first brought the Glasgow group international attention and solidified their noise-rock bonafides. Yes, </span><i>Young Team</i><span> is ably represented by its seismic 16-minute closer ""Mogwai Fear Satan"", but there's seemingly no room for its equally explosive counterpart ""Like Herod"", a song that pushed the well-worn indie-rock quiet/LOUD template to atomic extremes. (Perhaps Mogwai have come to see ""Like Herod"" as their ""Creep""—an early, simply structured, attention-seizing track to which they no longer feel a connection.) </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A career survey of Mogwai feels incomplete without ""Herod"", but, otherwise, </span><i>Central Belters</i><span>' first disc maps out the band's early peaks: the sad-eyed space rock of ""New Paths to Helicon Pt. 1"", the creeping, tension-tweaking build of ""Christmas Steps"", the mountain-scaling triumphalism of ""2 Rights Make 1 Wrong"", and the chrome-gilded grandeur of ""Hunted By a Freak"", which marked the breakthrough moment where Mogwai's epic canvases began to make room for a more finely tuned pop sensibility.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The second disc covers the era from 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5371-mr-beast/"" target=""_blank""><span><i>Mr. Beast</i> </span></a>to last fall's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20016-mogwai-music-industry-3-business-industry-1-ep/"" target=""_blank""><span><i>Music Industry 3</i>. <i>Fitness</i> <i>Industry 1</i></span></a> EP, over which the band's guitar-powered onslaughts gradually gave way to synth-driven experimentalism. Even with the benefit of a cherry-picked tracklist, <i>Central Belters</i> still can't mask the inertia that set in for Mogwai in the late 2000s, with tracks like <i>Mr. Beast</i><i>'</i>s ""Friend of the Night"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12241-the-hawk-is-howling/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Hawk Is Howling</i></a><i>'</i>s ""I'm Jim Morrison I'm Dead"" following a well-trodden path from desolate piano meditation to cymbal-crashing climax. However, the robo-Pavement groove of <i>Hawk</i> highlight ""The Sun Smells Too Loud"" points the way to the electro excursions of 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15100-hardcore-will-never-die-but-you-will/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hardcore Will Never Die But You Wil</i><i>l </i></a>and last year's <i>Rave Tapes</i>, wherein Mogwai toyed with cruise-controlled Krautrock (""Mexican Grand Prix"", ""How to Be a Werewolf"") and sci-fi soundtrack ambience (""Remurdered""), and seemed to genuinely loosen up after so many years of painstaking post-rock crescendo-climbing. And with the aforementioned ""Teenage Exorcists"", Mogwai proved themselves capable of writing a proper pop song, even if it took them nearly two decades to figure it out.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Central Belters</i><span>' third disc is given over to B-sides,</span><span> </span><span>EP deep cuts</span><span> and outtakes, but compared to the carefully curated, crafty sequencing of the</span><span> first two discs, it feels randomly cobbled together. </span>And though it zig-zags between eras—encompassing everything from the elegiac </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19466-mogwai-come-on-die-young-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Come On Die Young</i></a><span> era castaway ""Hugh Dallas"" to the band's ragged 2008 collaboration with Roky Erickson, ""Devil Rides"" to a sampling of their </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9617-zidane-a-21st-century-portrait-ost/""><i>Zidane</i></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17764-mogwai-les-revenants/"" target=""_blank""><i>Les Revenants</i></a><span> soundtracks—the overall tone is more dour and mournful. All but one of these tracks have been officially released (the exception being the loungey, laid-back instrumental ""D to E""), so it's hardly some unearthed treasure trove that warrants a separate presentation. Integrating these tracks into the chronological greatest-hits sequence would've made for a more satisfying overview.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But then that would've meant dropping the disc three finale—the 2001 single ""My Father My King""—halfway through the collection, and it's the sort of song that's nigh impossible to follow. A perennial Mogwai show closer, ""My Father My King"" is the band's wordless cover of the traditional Jewish prayer ""Avinu Malkeinu"", and it's biblical in every sense of the word, using the hymn's dual circular melodies to form a cyclonic 20-minute scorcher. It's the Mogwai song to end all Mogwai songs—and, really, the band never attempted anything as audacious, or brutally savage, from that point on. Its late-game appearance here reinforces </span><i>Central Belters</i><span>' raison d'etre: to trace the throughline between Mogwai's old and new testaments for lapsed fans and new converts alike.  </span></p></div>"|21086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21086-central-belters/|8.0|Stuart Berman

Singer/guitarist Katie Monks' voice is filthy and fleshy, as if the sodden voicebox of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3347-the-pogues/"">Shane McGowan</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27708-peter-doherty/"">Pete Doherty</a> had been transplanted into her own healthy 20-something throat. In almost every song, she unleashes a dive-bombing scream that drops like a flare down a well, illuminating the absurdity of mythologizing women's sexuality while also making plain how it feels to carry that burden. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Guitarists Monks and Liz Ball started Dilly Dally as school friends six years ago, immediately <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/blog/dilly-dally-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">confident</a> that they were the best band in town.<b> </b>With maturity came a little humility, but <i>Sore</i>—written and recorded with new bassist Jimmy Tony and drummer Ben Reinhartz—makes good on their early ambitions. The band reinforces the natural squalor of Monks' voice with heavy swagger redolent of some of the best ever alt-rock—the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a>' malevolent rumble, Hole's poisoned hard candy, and SST-style bile. Monks and Ball's guitar parts are full of personality, making Dilly Dally's dirges distinct and sticky whether they're scaling triumphal peaks like their their countrymen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"">Japandroids</a>, carving out idle, loping riffs—or flitting nimbly between modes in a single song.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>No matter what, the record sounds tumescent, like it's throbbing with blood and might spill over. Blood rushes to Monks' head amidst the skidding guitars and angelic coos of ""Desire"", a spellbound rave about some heavenly girl whose inner fire she's powerless to resist: ""Desire is coming at me lately,"" she sings, as if standing in the path of a runaway truck. On ""The Touch"", she describes a woman's healing hands, using enraptured language that mocks the cultural tendency to treat female sexuality as some kind of magic. </span>""Snake Head"" explores the dark side of that exoticizing. As blood leaks from between her legs, she jokes that she's turning into Medusa, and her bonehead so-called friends <i>agree</i>: ""Man, this bitch is goin' crazy/ She'll make you turn to stone.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite all this, <i>Sore</i> enshrines Monks' persistent faith in the transformative power of sex and love. There's a Celtic, Pogues-ish tinge to ""Green"", where a brief moment of lust (""I want you naked in my kitchen, making me breakfast"") gives way to a prayer of renewal, and the record's loveliest lyric: ""I need food and I need light, and darling I need you/ Just because my heart is clean doesn't mean it's new/ I scrub it up with love anthems written for teens, like by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2471-the-libertines/"">the Libertines</a>."" ""Next Gold"" is festive celebration rock, as Monks swears she'll ""stay chasing dreams tied to the road,"" spurred by the lingering taste of a car makeout session on her lips.

The concept is pretty simple, just string a cord through a bent stick. Then run it over stuff: other strings, other wood, your hands, etc. That’s it. To this day, they’re still frequently used in Africa, including Swaziland—the once-homeland of Cara Stacey. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To call Stacey well-versed as a musician is an understatement. The South African multi-instrumentalist, composer, and researcher received two master's degrees in musicology and musical performance from various universities in London and Edinburgh—and she's still working on a doctorate. With all that knowledge under her belt, Stacey gives South African music a dizzying, beautiful spin, wielding both an uhadi bow and an umrhubhe bow on eight-song voyage </span><i>Things That Grow</i><span>. The difference between the two is their resonators, the section of the bow which broadcasts their otherwise quiet sound. The uhadi is a long bow where the player attaches a gourd to the bow, moving it towards and away from their chest to let out pitch-varying overtones. The umrhubhe is a short bow where the player places their mouth on the bow, manipulating their tongue and throat muscles to highlight harmonics coming off the string. The sound hums with an unusually comforting tone, like a saw being sharpened or the coarse bellow of a violin in need of rosin. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Despite its rootsy instrumentation, the album is a raw collision of experimental classical with jazz. Because Cara Stacey didn't grow up in the rural Eastern Cape, nor was she set in the traditional ways of one of South Africa's most traditional instruments, she’s able to explore the bows’ sounds. Opener “Oscillations” hears her scratch the string repeatedly, building up a wall of buzz until the gentle padding of drums come into focus and, almost immediately after, the carefree whistle of someone strolling through the woods. “Durée” places the notes of her bow at the forefront again, even while upright bass begins to grow, so that its resonator captures her every move. There’s the occasional harsh scratch—think a single pinkie nail on a chalkboard—on a few songs, but otherwise the bows act like a never-ending scroll for the other instruments to hammer out a Morse Code message of complex meditation. Joined by Shabaka Hutchings (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Seb Rochford (drums), Ruth Goller (bass), Hugh Jones aka electronic musician Crewdson (concertronica), and Dan Leavers (synths), Stacey darts between animal-like calls over the course of the record, especially on nearly 10-minute album closer “Fox”. On </span><i>Things That Grow</i><span>, her companions play sensitively, keeping an eye on her use of the bow as to never overpower it, even with the studio space carefully capturing its nuances. “Sunbird”, full of warm strings and bizarre looped synth, keeps her bow ringing at its core, while it begins to take on the form of a short-seizing robot. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-326821e6-48c0-002d-f287-e836e9cdec31""><span>Even the eerie bass of “Dark Matter” should go full </span><i>Wed 21</i><span>-era Juana Molina on Stacey, its latin-style grooves taking the lead, but they refuse to let it drown her out. </span></span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Things That Grow</span><span> relies heavily on the improvisation of her bandmates and the fluidity with which their melodies play out. The only work composed beforehand by Stacey were melodic aspects and her individual bow parts. Yet that lack of cohesion can drag certain moments of improvisation down. The metal tapping in “Music of the Spheres” veers towards aimlessness in context of the album as a whole. Designated improvisational sections step back for someone else’s solo that occasionally lacks the confidence needed to take over. But improvisation doesn’t have to be indecisive. A track like “Circadian Clocks” treads minimalist repetition with Philip Glass in mind, and, when Stacey reaches far enough, she explores configurations other bow players have yet to publicly investigate, namely bringing the quiet bow into a buzzing room filled with conflicting instruments. For that alone, </span><i>Things That Grow</i><span> sees her shoot the image of the bow farther than we’ve come to understand it in the Western world today.</span></p></div>"|21114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21114-things-that-grow/|7.1|Nina Corcoran

But his debut album <i>Safe</i> squirms out of all such neat categories. Hailing from suburban south London, Carnell is of grime’s second generation, scholarly about its history but not hidebound by its rules. His more conventional productions have leant towards the energetic and darkside—see his 2013 track “Snakes”, the murky swing of its beats accompanied by the crack of gunshots. But increasingly, Visionist has shed conspicuous genre trappings and shucked off layers, too, tending towards something more minimal, introspective and haunted. His two <i>I’m Fine</i> EPs, released on the New York-based label Lit City Trax in 2013 and 2014, were ethereal and virtually beatless, barely grime at all. They explored, said Carnell, the five stages of grief—the journey from denial to anger to acceptance, known to psychiatrists as the Kübler-Ross model. About the precise nature of his loss, though, Carnell was keeping schtum.</p>
<p>Since, Carnell has joined forces with Bill Kouligas of the Berlin-based label PAN to create a new sub-label Codes—a sort of reboot of his earlier label Lost Codes, dedicated to outliers in the grime matrix. And now the debut Visionist album appears on PAN, and comes with a theme not unlike <i>I’m Fine</i>—billed as “a personal portrait of anxiety” that traces the onset and passing of a panic attack. This subject came as a little bit of a surprise, as I interviewed Carnell in 2014 and he struck me as coolly self-assured in that way that you might easily read as arrogance. Still, reflect on the crisp meticulousness of his music—those deft flurries of icy melody, vocal samples diced as if by scalpel—and perhaps you can perceive a telltale tension in his hand, a yearning for precision and control.</p>
<p>As with the <i>I’m Fine</i> EPs, <i>Safe</i> finds Carnell working extensively with the human voice. Broadly, his approach with vocals recalls that of Burial: both filch acapellas from pop and R&amp;B records before bending them out of shape and turning them to new ends. In Burial’s productions, though, vocal lines generally remain vocal lines, while what Carnell does with them feels rather more baroque. On <i>Safe</i>, these voices are assembled as melody lines – cloned, layered and pitched way up until they form a fluttering polyphony, or glitter like jewels in a crown. (Perhaps a closer reference point for Carnell’s sampling technique would be Fatima Al-Qadiri’s <i>Asiatisch</i>; indeed, the pair collaborated on an earlier Visionist track, “The Call”, their breathy melodies arranged as point and counterpoint).</p>
<p>The track titling—“Tired Tears, Awake Fears”, “Let Me In”, “Constraint”—indicates something of the territory that <i>Safe</i> seeks to cover, a landscape in which love equals imprisonment and feelings skirted or repressed. Around beautiful melodies, Carnell arranges more dissonant sounds to imply pain or unease. On the opening “You Stayed”, a diva's cry is encased in a prison of cascading, pointillist melodies and queasy timbres. On “Victim”, metallic percussion pounds without mercy, while up in the higher registers, synthesized strings sketch out a sad elegy and voices curl into gasps, sobs and whimpers. Sometimes, vocal lines repeat themselves, numbly circling as if frozen in some kind of Stygian limbo—see the closing refrain of “Too Careful To Care”, a cry of “In my head…” that repeats over and over, pitched alternately high, low and midrange, as if in search of some sort of escape route. Elsewhere, Carnell’s disembodied cries strike more graceful notes, as if their wordlessness allows them to softly alight on truths over which mortal sentences clumsily stumble.</p>
<p>Key to Carnell’s style is a sense of spaciousness, although <i>Safe</i> is more filled out, less minimal than the <i>I’m Fine</i> material. Still, it is seldom predictable. The breathtaking, gothic “1 Guarda” moves forth on ticking hats and dull rumbles that sound like rotating granite pillars, and where there are beats, they upset expectations. Floor-trembling bass bombs erupt spasmodically throughout “Constraint” and ""Safe"", while “Let Me In” rolls forth on the sort of booming trap undercarriage you might expect to hear blasting from a passing jeep—although everything above that is a mirage, a weave of woozy strobes and hiccupping voices. Here and there, Carnell does pare things right back, and this is where <i>Safe</i> is at its very prettiest. “Sleep Luxury” is a washed-out grime lullaby adorned by twinkling harp and the ripple of running water, while the cold chimes of “Sin-cere” appear to fantasize a music box sculpted wholly from ice.</p>
<p>This year has been a banner year for producers working at grime’s outer reaches. On the one hand, the likes of M.E.S.H. and Rabit have released records that intensify grime’s alien skitter into something harsh, mechanical, and abstracted. In parallel, the “weightless” tendency, pioneered by Mumdance and Logos’ Different Circles imprint, pulls away layers, lifts grime off the road and into the stratosphere. <i>Safe</i> draws on elements of both, but more than any of his peers, Carnell has succeeded in making a statement that feels not just a flexing of experimental techniques, but something rich and human, too. Perhaps its closest recent antecedent is Arca’s <i>Xen</i>, another record dealing with the desire to shed one’s skin, slip free of this prison of the flesh. Diaphanous of texture but heavy of spirit, <i>Safe</i> revolves upon this tension, the pressure point of a soul under strain. </p></div>"|21051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21051-safe/|7.9|Louis Pattison

He also released an odd, anomalous single in the same year, ""It's My Life,"" on the brand new label, Circle Star Records.</p>
<p>Six years later, Circle Star has returned and it's become easier to understand why it exists. In <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/255-stones-throw-doc-our-vinyl-weighs-a-ton/"">Our Vinyl Weighs a Ton</a>, </i>the documentary about Stones Throw, there's a period during which it seems that the label's founder, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6136-peanut-butter-wolf/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Peanut Butter Wolf</a>, has completely lost his interest in hip-hop. As he starts flirting with glam rock, AM radio redux, and other, weirder stuff, the loyal fans of Stones Throw can't understand what's going on. ""For all of us frickin' die-hard, hip-hop, b-boy type people, we were just a little confused,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28105-the-gaslamp-killer/"">the Gaslamp Killer</a> says of the period.</p>
<p>The siloed existence of Circle Star Records is an explicit effort to clear up that confusion. Its artists don't fit neatly into Stones Throw's traditional output, at least when it comes to genre. Alex Brettin, who performs as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/themildhighclub"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mild High Club</a>, is a good example; he's just released <i>Timeline</i> on Circle Star. It's a record full of psychedelic soft rock that draws strongly from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13432-the-beatles/"">White-album</a> era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> and T-Rex, with swirls of '80s-indebted synthpop.</p>
<p>Like Dâm-Funk, Brettin is a musician's musician, whose bona fides, for those not familiar with his technical ability, are communicated by his associates: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"">Mac DeMarco</a>. Occasionally, there are strong echoes of Pink and DeMarco on <i>Timeline</i> but Brettin ends up sounding more like their tame cousin. As the artist name suggests with the word ""mild,"" <i>Timeline</i> is largely missing those moments of heightened intensity that make an album memorable. There are nods to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4746-the-zombies/"">the Zombies</a> and Jim Croce; it's uneventfully easy listening all the way through. </p>
<p>The most exciting tracks here have rougher reference points. The undergirding riff on ""Rollercoaster Baby"", brings out the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8549-marc-bolan/"">Marc Bolan</a> in Brettin, making for a slightly more charged experience. On ""Undeniable"", he confidently assumes the mantle of his psychedelic forebear, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6124-arthur-lee/"">Arthur Lee</a> with some fantastic, buzzing guitar work.</p>
<p>Spot the Influence can be a critic's shell game, a way to sort of triangulate a new artist without actually engaging with his or her work. But the fact that Brettin's many reference points are so obvious suggests a problem with the music of Mild High Club: the act's identity is so loose that listeners will have trouble ignoring its artistic antecedents. If this is musical pointillism, then the dots are just too big.</p>
<p>None of this comes as a total surprise. Peanut Butter Wolf has always had a huge admiration for oddball creatives with vast technical ability, and has never seemed concerned with originality, per se. His feeling appears to be that giving talented people room to record is enough; and maybe he's right. After all, nothing about <i>Timeline</i> is <i>bad</i>. It's a pretty strong release for a brand new imprint to build on. But if the same record were released from, say, Stones Throw, we might sigh, and chalk it up to another good-but-not-great album from a label that still hasn't quite figured out a unified new direction.</p></div>"|21185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21185-timeline/|6.3|Jonah Bromwich

Save for 2011’s uncharacteristically concise <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15000-the-king-is-dead/"">The King Is Dead</a></i>, even their best albums often seemed like too much of a good thing, and most have felt longer than their runtimes—much, much longer in the case of 2009’s proggy endurance test <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12842-the-hazards-of-love/"">The Hazards of Love</a></i>, a cautionary tale about the overreach ambitious artists are capable of when left unchecked. Like <i>The King Is Dead</i> before it, this year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20083-what-a-terrible-world-what-a-beautiful-world/"">What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World</a></i> played like a correction to that record, a continued dialing back of the band’s more audacious tendencies, but it was overstuffed in its own right, and with no musical or conceptual themes binding its 14 songs, it begged for some focus. <i>Terrible</i> <i>World</i> was the first Decemberists album that didn’t have the vision to justify its bloat.</p>
<p>Casual fans won’t be overcome with excitement upon learning the band’s <i>Florasongs</i> EP was culled from leftovers from the <i>Terrible World</i> sessions. Even for Decemberists diehards, an addendum to the band’s most forgettable album probably wasn’t high on the wish list, and the EP reaffirms what <i>Terrible World</i> already made clear: that Colin Meloy brought an abundance of songs to these sessions, but not much in the way of a big picture. Unlike its full-length counterpart, though, <i>Florasongs</i> has brevity working in its favor. These days, the Decemberists sound best in small doses, and at just five songs and 19 minutes long, the EP goes down easier than its predecessor.</p>
<p>If the EP has a unifying thread, it’s the band’s wide-eyed fascination with '80s college rock. Filled with ringing guitars and taut melodies, ""Why Would I Now?"" moves with the swift efficiency of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"">Elvis Costello</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1626-king-of-america/"">King of America</a></i>-era output. A shanty caressed with accordions, ""Riverswim"" plays like it was traced over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3347-the-pogues/"">the Pogues</a>’ ""Dirty Old Town"". And though Decemberists have so fully internalized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a>’s playbook by now that they could probably turn around a <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15625-lifes-rich-pageant-25th-anniversary-edition/"">Lifes Rich Pageant</a></i> tribute album on two days’ notice, ""The Harrowed and the Haunted"" is one of their most elegant homages, building to the same lovely, slow reveal as R.E.M.’s dreamiest numbers. Even the Communist Russia setting of ""Fits &amp; Starts"", the EP’s lone rocker, feels like a throwback to the Reagan era in its own way. ""I was watching on the apparat/ Some comely little apparatchik felled,"" Meloy sings over pounding pianos. As rowdy party songs go, it’s hardly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22438-acdc/"">AC/DC</a>, but it’s about as close as he’ll get.</p>
<p>As <i>The King Is Dead</i> proved, there’s still some pleasure in hearing a relatively reigned-in Decemberists. But while the band wears restraint well, <i>Florasongs</i> never overcomes the sense that they’re selling themselves short, penning good-enough songs when they used to shoot for grand, great ones. This is a band that once thrived on risks. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9472-the-crane-wife/"">The Crane Wife</a></i> shouldn’t have worked but it did. <i>The Hazards of Love </i>shouldn’t have worked and, by and large, it didn’t, and ever since they've been playing it safe. After five years of bowling with bumpers, maybe it’s time for them to start taking chances once again.</p></div>"|21137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21137-florasongs-ep/|5.8|Evan Rytlewski

On the claustrophobic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18202-mac-miller-watching-movies-with-the-sound-off/""><i>Watching Movies With the Sound Off</i></a>, he was rapping in a pitched-down voice alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30353-ab-soul/"">Ab-Soul</a> about friends lost, drugs consumed, depression, and the trappings of success. And on the transparent, relaxed<i> GO:OD AM</i>, he sounds like someone’s troubled little brother made good: from the album’s opening horns, you can sense that this is a victory lap for Mac, a homecoming.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From start to finish, this is his most refined and well put-together project. Getting through the 16 tracks on <i>Blue Slide Park</i> was like an endurance test, and even the deeper and much-improved <i>Watching Movies</i> started to sound interchangeable before it ended. The beats on <i>GO:OD AM </i>have a New York, boom-bap feel, with lots of jazz samples and harder drums, and it’s both more varied and more upbeat, from the trap-sounding beats of  ""When in Rome"" or the <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a>-featuring ""Cut the Check"" to love songs like ""ROS"" or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a> collaboration ""The Weekend"". Miller said he recorded 400 songs for <i>Watching</i>, and sometimes you couldn’t help but wonder about the selection process (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9C7Bo2vzU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Objects in the Mirror""</a>?) but on <i>GO:OD AM</i>, he’s learned to self-edit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Lyrically, Mac offers a music industry ""Scared Straight"". ""I’ve seen some motherfucking shit,"" he warns on ""Two Matches"". The interlude before ""God Speed"" includes a voicemail from his brother, checking in on him at a low point in his life, and later on in the song, he admits: ""White lines be numbing them dark times/ Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up/ Admit it’s a problem, I need a wake up/ Before one morning, I don’t wake up."" It’s funny to hear a 23-year-old who just kicked his habit and could be considered a kid himself refer regretfully to ""</span><span>all the kids doing drugs"" on ""In the Bag"", but Mac has enough of his sense of humor intact to keep the album from playing like a D.A.R.E. campaign on wax.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On ""God Speed"", the album’s standout track, he pays tribute to the close friends in his </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Miller_and_the_Most_Dope_Family"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Most Dope Family</span></a><span>, especially his right hand man Q, and it’s genuinely touching. ""Everybody saying I need rehab/ So I’m speeding with a blindfold on/ It won’t be long before they watching me crash/ And they don’t wanna see that,"" he raps, thanking the people that got him through the toughest time of his life. He’s never preachy, though: He sounds refreshed and rejuvenated, like someone who has been going for daily walks, eating veggies and drinking fruit smoothies every day.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-bcaebb8f-3d53-0907-a3a6-bb4b89293f44"">Many songs here reference his status as a white rapper, signaling his awareness of the rap game’s perception of him: ""I’m a white rapper/ They always call me shady,"" he says on ""Brand Name"", just a few minutes into the album. ""I know niggas think you white and you not about to go in with these bars,"" chimes in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"">Domo Genesis</a> on ""In the Bag"". There’s a kind of authenticity to him that has been there since the beginning, if you look for it: He doesn’t rap about breaking the law, because he’s not about that life. He’s a corny white rapper (meant as a compliment) who loves his family, friends, and hometown. We might not learn a lot of specifics about him, but there’s a lot of honesty in his music if you look for it. </span></p></div>"|21038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21038-mac-miller-good-am/|7.3|Tayler Montague

The song is moody and intriguing, and just when you think it might be a good playlist candidate for a road trip with your parents, he warps his voice into <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmjrTcYMqBM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chipmunk</a> territory on the line ""bug in the crosshair"". </p>
<p>Alex G has often used pitch-shifting, but he deploys it more than ever on<i> Beach Music. </i>""Brite Boy"" sends his voice up a few notches to play a girl whose affection the title character will spurn <span id=""docs-internal-guid-0c361f09-4343-1c62-b2be-df267f778050""><span>and whose help he will reject</span></span>, while ""Station"" brings his voice down so he can embody a homeless man breaking into a liquor store.  And ""Salt"" features both high and low voices, like tribes of ogres and elves uniting in song.</p>
<p>These moments bring to mind the similar voice trickery of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"" target=""_blank"">Ween</a>, who formed just about 50 miles north of Havertown, Pennsylvania, where Giannascoli grew up. The difference between the two lies in their motivation: Ween used the trick for comic effect, but<span id=""docs-internal-guid-0c361f09-4343-902b-9665-17d89278307c""><span> Alex G doesn’t seem like he’s goofing around</span></span>. Ween wrote in the liner notes for <a href=""http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/04/dusting-em-off-ween-the-pod/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Pod</i></a> that they were huffing Scotchgard while recording—though they've since said they were bluffing—but Alex G makes no narcotic admissions whatsoever.  Regardless if the composition process involved new chemicals or not, it's clear that a lot of nefarious characters are lurking in these songs. Giannascoli's style has been compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a> in the past, and that's often been true of his presentation, but on <i>Beach Music, </i>it's as if the characters from Smith's darker songs have wandered over to Giannascoli's world, and they're a lot worse for wear.</p>
<p>Most of the songs have one-word titles and the lyrics are both vague and evocative. These traits come together best in the haunting and sweet ""Mud<span>"". </span>For this track, Giannascoli reaches beyond the pitch-shifter and gets an actual additional human being, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32770-emily-yacina/"" target=""_blank"">Emily Yacina</a>, to harmonize with him. When the pair repetitively whisper-sing, ""I know something you don't know,<span>""</span> your mind leaps to the worst conclusions of what this ""something<span>""</span> could be, as nauseous keys creep into the arrangement and overtake the sounds of fingers skating up and down the frets of an acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>Some of the songs also feature the slightly atonal jangle that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a> eventually claimed as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3a3ldBRwbw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their sound</a> when they became a full band. What is remarkable about <i>Beach Music</i> is that some of these arrangements beg for you to dismiss them, the way you might have <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KsYdKwUQvI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the very first time you heard Pavement</a>, but what at first feels sloppy and clogged is actually intricate upon closer inspection. Complicated arrangements and gorgeous melodies reveal themselves  to you as rewards for your patience. Over time, even the alien voices begin to sound natural, even inviting. </p></div>"|21138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21138-beach-music/|7.2|Pat Healy

While John Elliott was headbanging away to rhythms that only he could hear and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"">Mark McGuire</a> adopted the traditional grimace of rock'n'roll axemen since time immemorial, Hauschildt stood stock-still behind his synths, like a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> who had strayed from the assembly line. Since the Cleveland synth-and-guitar trio's 2013 split, Elliott has poured his energies into his <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/releases/spectrum-spools/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spectrum Spools</a> label's considerable output, and Mark McGuire has put out six or seven new records, some with a considerable shred quotient. Hauschildt, meanwhile, has mostly kept his head down. Last year he released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18540-steve-hauschildt-sh/""><i>S/H</i></a>, a double-CD collection of studio experiments, live cuts, and CD-R favorites, but <i>Where All Is Fled </i>is his first album of new material since 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17360-sequitur/""><i>Sequitur</i></a>. That album surprised many listeners, given the way that it balanced Hauschildt's customary ambient burble with pert drum-machine programming, vocoder, and synth-pop flourishes. But <i>Where All Is Fled</i> swings the pendulum back towards his sweet spot, musically speaking: gentle arpeggios, chiming leads, sunrise synths poised on the brink between sublimity and kitsch. It's his most emotionally potent offering yet, taking the gentle ecstasy of previous records and drawing it into a deep, soul-cleansing reverie.</p>
<p>Hauschildt lays all his cards out on the table with ""Eyelids Gently Dreaming"", a graceful piece built around a melodic chord progression, steady as an IV drip, that sounds a lot like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"">Stars of the Lid</a>—is the title a giveaway?—rendered with synthesizers instead of guitars and strings. ""Anesthesia"", a weightless shimmer that sounds like something off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a>' <i>Victorialand </i>run through a very expensive reverb unit, suggests what you'd get if King Midas picked up an opiate habit. And the unabashedly sentimentalist title track wouldn't be out of place in an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWjBM48YP0s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>On Golden Pond </i></a>reboot, what with its teary-eyed piano melody. Still, there's a strangeness to the overall sound—the piano pocked with stuttering artifacts, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"">Fennesz</a>-style distortion looming beneath—that sets it apart. Even when he's reaching for his hanky, he's careful to keep one hand on his synth, tweaking away in search of the perfect patch.</p>
<p>But it's not all so slow-moving; On tracks like ""Vicinities"", ""Edgewater Prelude"", and ""The World Is Too Much With Us"", Hauschildt channels his energy into arpeggios that spin like sparkling dynamos. ""Arpeggiare"" is particularly lively, with dizzying delay taps suggesting Frippertronics in zero-G. His newfound focus on pulse sometimes leads him to forms approaching a kind of drum-free dance music. The cosmic ""Sundialed"", with its wild, chromatic leaps, is not so far off from Lindstrom's super-saturated space disco, and ""Caduceus"" is reminiscent of John Beltran's <i>Ten Days of Blue</i>, Detroit Escalator Co.'s <i>Black Buildings</i>, and other examples of techno at its most yearning. And fans of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ShjrvYZ7M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pub's ""Summer""</a>, a now-obscure dub techno single from 2000, will be thrilled by how uncannily Hauschildt has recreated that song's watery bliss. </p>
<p>While it's true that much of the album represents a refinement of ideas and processes that Hauschildt has been playing with for years, at least one song, ""Lifelike"", points to possible avenues for further development. Like ""Aqueuus"", it's a wonderfully watery meditation on the kinetics of bubbles. Chimes and plucks peel off into rippling delay chains, and the shimmering melodic line suggests a lullaby for jellyfish; it's a picture of biology as rapture, of physics as ecstasy. We've always known that Hauschildt could make amazing sounds. The question, going into this album, was whether he could give them purpose and meaning—whether he could put his technical mastery into the service of music at once experimental and lyrical. <i>Where All Is Fled</i> answers resoundingly in the affirmative.</p></div>"|21095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21095-where-all-is-fled/|7.5|Philip Sherburne

To anyone not paying attention, his return to the mainstream with his viral Vine hit <a href=""https://vine.co/search/Young+Dro+FDB"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""FDB""</a> in 2013 was probably out of left field, but in truth he's been around the whole time: producing<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17307-ralph-lauren-reefa/""> a steady stream of mostly solid mixtapes</a> and using his always slightly-offbeat eccentricity to keep the songs exciting. <i>Da Reality Show</i>, Young Dro's third major-label album, is an acknowledgement of Dro's place in the current rap landscape; it's at once an album that could have easily dropped shortly after 2006's <i>Best Thang Smokin'</i><i>,</i> yet still feels refreshingly new without being forced.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dro has been making music since the early '00s, but we're coming up on 10 years since his first major album, and <i>Da Reality Show</i><span> is a celebration of and a reflection on a life well-lived, full of goofiness, giddiness and sobering reminiscence.  He's feeling himself<span>—</span>""I kilt the streets and made history"", he boasts on ""Coupe""<span>—</span>and very few are as good at doing that as Dro is, with as many undertones. On the song ""Dead"", he raps: ""</span><span>Hope yo ass be ready for the fed/Hope yo ass be ready for the lead/Hope you ready for the hospital bed/dopeboy, dopeboy, now the nigga dead"" </span><span>as a way of calling out another dealer as a sucker. It's typical braggadocio, but in it also is a glimmer of awareness about the inevitabilities of trap life.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This introspective honesty carries the back half of the album.  ""I know how it feel to be numba one/I know how it feel to be numba nothin’”, he raps soberly on “Feeling Myself”. Dro seems comfortable enough with who he is to put his real self on record, and the record carries the gravity that comes with seeing both the highs and lows a long rap career can bring.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>He also has a natural sense of how he fits into the sounds of rap radio today without compromising his essence. <span> The album finds Dro perfectly at ease with the sound of current Atlanta and making it work for him instead of the other way around. The Zaytoven-assisted ""Ugh"" is a melodic and busy hymnal, and amid Zaytoven's menagerie of sounds, Dro's is the best instrument. He glides through it,  crooning then rapping like his words are drum kicks to making playful ad-libs and ad-libbing on top of those ad-libs. It's an effortless energy and showmanship that he carries into the next track ""Parallel Park"". The church organs that surround the song are appropriate; Dro captures your attention and is as theatrical in his style as an Atlanta Megachurch Preacher. </span></span></p>
<p><i>Da Reality Show</i> would have probably been better off holding onto this momentum, because the traditional attempts at inspirational anthems in the back half feel a little forced, and lack the freewheeling excitement of the rest of the album. At the end,however, Dro allows himself to really get sentimental on ""Hood Gospel"", reflecting on lost love and the murder of his mother. The pain is audible in his voice, but so is the full-hearted joy and wonder at his rise from those traumatic experiences to where he is now. It is a beautiful moment and a reminder that behind all the boasts about exotic-colored cars and women, there is a man who just wants to share his testimony.</p></div>"|21080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21080-da-reality-show/|7.4|Israel Daramola

""I feel like I just want my emotions to be at the forefront of my performance, and if anything distracts from that, I’m in trouble,"" <a href=""http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/kelela-on-bjork-and-performing-electronic-live.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she told The Cut</a>, riffing on the experience of seeing the veteran of digital feelings, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>, on stage. That kind of resonant tactility also goes a long way when it comes to listening to electronic music, and Kelela’s 2013 release<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18661-kelela-cut-4-me/""><i> Cut 4 Me</i></a> indicates that, whether she was aware of it or not, this ability to transpose intimacy to music has been part of her wheelhouse from the start.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Her new EP, <i>Hallucinogen</i>, uses the gristle and guts of feeling as a thematic base for exploring new textures in music. Like <i>Cut 4 Me</i>, the sound is like being enveloped in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRaN7wB85a4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">black-lit silence of the intro to <i>Belly</i></a>: it’s a sensuous, sensitive, hi-definition approach to R&amp;B. Some of the producers are the same (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28578-kingdom/"">Kingdom</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29623-nguzunguzu/"">Nguzunguzu</a>’s MA) and some are new (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a>, Kendrick and Drake collaborator DJ Dahi), but these partnerships hew to what’s now the Kelela template: soulful songs with unpredictable, assaultive drum patterns, whorls of whimsical synthesizer effects, and so much processing on the vocals that it sounds like you’re listening to a transmission from tomorrow. The deconstructed clatter of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>—who also worked with Arca—might be from another dimension altogether, but Kelela, whose music feels like there is blood flowing through it, looks to a future with a decidedly human shape. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Kingdom, who co-produces the EP’s sole uptempo track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17663-kelela-rewind/"">""Rewind""</a>, is a student of Timbaland’s slick approach to pop-R&amp;B. Alongside Kelela and Nugget, he channels that, as well as the bounce of Jazze Pha, for the song, which is the EP’s lead single and a showpiece for Kelela’s much-improved singing. ""All the Way Down"" pulls rap producer DJ Dahi into completely different terrain; the shudders of hi-hat trills provide the seams, but the print he’s working with is studded with twinkling synths that gives way to a droning. Dahi’s beat doesn’t explicitly recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"">Aaliyah</a>, but Kelela's voice does—she riffs on the melody and phrasing and pillow talk-closeness of the late singer’s 1999 track, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1ms8cdR1ew"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Don’t Wanna""</a> (incidentally, a Jazze Pha production).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">More pressing is the existential rumble that bookends the EP. ""All I know is all I’ve got/ Is it hard to face all we lost?,"" Kelela questions on the desolate opener ""A Message"". Arca’s hollow kickdrums prod the song along at a ragged crawl, allowing Kelela to wring out a melody with her voice while he fills the space with funereal, yawping organ-like patches. It’s the only song on the EP, aside from closer ""The High"", in which Kelela sings without heavy reverb or effects, heightening its somber quality.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""And I’ll do anything for the high,"" she urges a placid lover on the latter, the piercing hook contrasting with her hushed verses. In content—and maybe even in producer Gifted &amp; Blessed’s tranquil heartbeat—it’s a song that feels spiritually descended from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>. And there's another connection: writing on Pitchfork about the Weeknd’s music and its inherited ambience, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/793-the-weeknds-east-african-roots/"">Hannah Giorgis </a>described a ""long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining,"" and it’s instructive to think that Kelela—whose family is also from Ethiopia—may have absorbed a similar propensity for mournful music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you consider that Kelela’s roots are in soul and R&amp;B, the emotional side of her music makes sense. The mechanics of dance music <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/pitchfork-essentials/9702-emotional-intelligence-a-guide-to-melodic-idm/"">might inspire feelings in listeners</a>, but within the genre, overrun with the egos and opinions of ""bro-teurs,"" her emotions are revolutionary. She is a transparent creator, unafraid of tainting the canvases of her mostly male collaborators with the imperfect, vulnerable contents of her brain and heart.</p></div>"|20432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20432-hallucinogen-ep/|8.3|Anupa Mistry

It’s 1987 in Pontiac, Mich., and Pope John Paul II is visiting the Silverdome, delivering Mass to the 100,000 faithful who’d come to hear him speak. Among them was a young Joe Casey who, 25 years later, would grow up to become Protomartyr’s frontman. The event was historic—it set an attendance record at the arena—but what Casey remembers about it in ""Pontiac 87"" isn’t the beauty of the sermon or the spectacle in the ceremony, but the ugliness boiling just beneath the surface. On his way into the arena, he sees ""money changing between hands,"" and on his way out, a riot, where ""Old folks turn brutish/ Trampling their way out the gates towards heaven.""</p>
<p>This is the universe Protomartyr inhabits, one where violence hovers constantly at the periphery, where peace and hope gradually curdle and turn ugly, and the desperate people who once clung to them eventually fall prey to their worst impulses. The emotionally brutal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19150-protomartyr-under-color-of-official-right/""><i>Under Color of Official Right</i></a> from 2014 took place against the crumbling skyline of Detroit, where deadbeat fathers disappeared into bars while their children planned revenge at home and politicians made backwards deals that benefited no one but themselves. On <i>Intellect</i>, Casey’s got bigger matters on his mind. The first character we meet on the record is, literally, the Devil, but he doesn’t have red horns and a trident, and he’s not cackling in a smoldering cavern. He’s a teenager in his bedroom at home, full of promise and almost dewy-eyed naiveté until his peers shun him and all of his grand plans fail, and he’s left at the end of the song vowing, ""I will make them feel the way I do/ I’ll corrupt them ‘til they think the way I do."" If <i>Right</i> was about the evil that men do, <i>Intellect</i> goes one bigger and asks <i>why</i> they do it. The answer, again and again, is rooted in hurt, pain, neglect, and disappointment.</p>
<p><i>Intellect</i> draws its energy from the panic of mortality. Casey lost his father to a heart attack and his mother to Alzheimer’s disease as he was writing the record, and their presence on <i>Intellect</i> provides some of its most wrenching emotional moments. His mother arrives strong and determined on the grim, booming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17598-protomartyr-why-does-it-shake/"">""Why Does It Shake?""</a>, swearing, ""Lithe in thought and pumping blood…I’m never gonna lose it,"" but suddenly the song collapses and decays. It concludes with the chilling appearance of ""the stranger"" who, in Casey’s words, always wins—""He enters the temple/ It falls/ It always falls."" The song’s title comes from something Casey’s mother said, noticing the tremors of old age in her hands. That sound of the ticking clock makes all of the violence and drunkenness on <i>Intellect</i> seem that much more desperate, that much more futile.</p>
<p>Throughout the album, the band rises to meet the weighty subject matter. On <i>Right</i>, songs arrived in brute slashes, but on <i>Intellect</i> they’re textured and spacious. Guitarist Greg Ahee cloaks ""Cowards Starve"" in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Morricone</a>-like cowboy flange, gradually gathering tension until the song detonates in the chorus. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17645-protomartyr-dope-cloud/"">""Dope Cloud""</a> rides a razor-wire post-punk guitar line as its protagonists accumulate treasure only to be met with Casey’s bleak reminder, ""That’s not gonna save you, man."" And in ""Ellen"", a love song written from the perspective of Casey’s father to his mother, they beautifully underplay, supporting the song’s sweet sentiment in feathery chords.</p>
<p>But it is Casey who has undergone the greatest evolution. Casey has described his stage demeanor as ""30 minutes of a fat guy yelling at you,"" but on <i>Intellect</i>, he’s more measured, and his writing has developed an almost Joycean grasp of detail and narrative. The second verse of ""Pontiac 87"" feels like something that could have turned up in <a href=""http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/958/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Dead""</a>: a crowd of regulars pile into the Detroit bar Jumbo’s (familiar to Protomartyr fans from its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VvfluJXxTg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">appearance</a> on <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18192-protomartyr-no-passion-all-technique/""><i>No Passion All Technique</i></a>) the day after Christmas. Casey describes the scene with such stunning narrative economy you can almost see the lines on their faces: ""Remembering a Jumbo’s night, December 26th/ Weird faces filled up the bar, half sober/ Outside, a steady snow—all new white."" He’s also become a powerful, passionate <i>singer</i>. His delivery throughout <i>Intellect</i> has gravity and nuance; he’s able to make a sing-along out of the line ""Social pressures exist/ And if you think about them all of the time/ You’re gonna find that your head’s been kicked in."" <span>He goes from baleful and bereft to nasty and snarling, commanding “Destroy the gateway, bind them up, break the circuit, cast them out.”</span></p>
<p>And what he’s driving at, again and again, is that we do all of those things when we feel like trapped animals, when we’ve thrown our full bodies into life and it’s given us nothing back but loneliness and poverty and emptiness, and each advancing year is less time we have to do something of substance. It’s a profound and uncomfortable truth, and it’s one that <i>The Agent Intellect </i>unflinchingly stares down.</p>
<p>All of this is highlighted to shattering effect in ""Uncle Mother’s"". At first, it seems like another in a long line of Protomartyr bar tableaus, the battered working class piling into a dive to suck down Old Styles until the world seems bearable again. The revelation of the song’s true meaning comes in what at first feels like a throwaway detail. At the start of the song, Casey advises, ""Welcome to Uncle Mother’s/ Leave your children in the car."" From there the carousing begins, and the usual boxes are checked: there’s a drug deal in the kitchen and bad doings in the back corner. But at the end of the song, Casey repeats himself, and turns a declarative into a question: ""Welcome to Uncle Mother’s/ Are your children still in the car?"" In that moment it becomes clear that the subject of the song isn’t the drunks—it’s the <i>children</i>. That subtle shift is what gives the record its almost palpable sense of humanity, of sorrow, of compassion. On <i>The Agent Intellect</i>, we are <i>all</i><i> </i>the children, shivering alone in an empty station wagon in a bitter Detroit night, waiting in vain for someone to come and take us home.</p></div>"|20966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20966-the-agent-intellect/|8.2|J.

""We are attempting to stretch—not replace—jazz's rhythmic, melodic and harmonic conventions to encompass as many musical forms/languages/cultures as we can,"" he says on his website. He titled his fifth album after the concept, but this sensibility is visible even in his earliest work as a leader; the title track of 2007's </span><i>Anthem</i><span> is jazz in its instrumentation, but it also obeys the rhythms and structures of post-hardcore, a series of contrasting shapes which build an atomically tense and spectral space, like a cathedral at night. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His description of ""stretch music"" somewhat resembles the omnivorous jazz approaches of bassist/singer Esperanza Spalding and pianist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32926-robert-glasper-trio/"">Robert Glasper</a>. It's similarly collaborative and elastic. But Scott's genre splicing is not as mosaic as Glasper's. It’s doesn’t lock different genres together in unusual patterns as much as it melts them down into asymmetrical and indivisible sculpture. It's almost curious to call it ""stretch music"" when it feels as if jazz isn’t so much expanded here as collapsed into small, oblique jewels.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Later in his mission statement, Scott describes his intention to draw unusual instruments through distortion. This is how </span><i>Stretch Music</i><span> begins: A piano, played by Lawrence Fields, struggles through noise, as if pressing and blurring against a force field. Instruments undergo a kind of metamorphosis in Scott’s aesthetic, which is reflected in the album cover: his trumpet bends and warps into elastic shapes.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On record, Scott’s playing is patient and crisp, and it seems the product of spatial reasoning, more concerned with the area around his notes than their actual occurrence. He is sometimes accompanied by the ribbony flute phrases of Elena Pinderhughes, which contrast pleasingly with the routine collapse of the backdrop.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This collapse is occasioned by the percussion, played by Corey Fonville and Joe Dyson, Jr., alternately on drums and SPD-SX pads. Snare rolls are enhanced into dense exaggerations, glitching in and out of compressed rattles which physically approach vortexes of static. It lends the songs the accelerated yet organized rhythms of accident; it reminds me of sparks convulsing from a severed cable.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sometimes the instrumentation is more obscure, as on ""Tantric"" and ""Perspectives"", each chord landing and shimmering with a kind of blurred phosphorescence. There are also more typical fusion exercises, as on ""West of the West"", where Matthew Stevens’ guitar recalls the metallic echo of Sonny Sharrock.</span></p>

His music is the opposite of dislocated; it is thoroughly articulated, busy and compressed. The reach of </span><i>Stretch Music</i><span> can often feel literal—even as the threads warp and drift a deeply woven structure is preserved. </span></span></p></div>"|21105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21105-stretch-music/|7.5|Brad Nelson

It's not hard to see why they'd want to avoid the political umbrella: when a British band cops to having political motivations, their inability to overhaul the system/write <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ2oXzrnti4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ghost Town""</a> Part Two is usually held up as a sign of their failure—in the U.K., at any rate. And so rather than subject themselves to that scrutiny, Shopping instead choose to shake off their oppressors, encouraging shimmying to fill the emptiness of the superficial social interactions and masquerade of commerce-as-choice that their songs quite clearly detail.</p>
<p>There’s no shortage of academic texts citing the radical nature of movement, but the trio’s second album, <i>Why Choose</i>, is blissfully direct and free of added intellectual ballast. When so much modern discourse is a teetering layer cake of opinions, it’s bliss to hear Rachel Aggs celebrate idleness in one breath—over the awkward twangs of ""Time Wasted""—and then demand urgency on ""Why Wait""’s anxious, accelerated disco hi-hats. As she puts it in the latter, ""Why choose when I just want it both ways?/ When I could just take it all?/ I wanna do it my way.""</p>
<p>To that end, very few of Shopping’s post-punk moves are novel, but the trio maintain an exhilarating, crafty pace, having upped the detail and twisted the structures of their songs since 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20572-consumer-complaints/""><i>Consumer Complaints</i></a>. The almost uniformly plain guitar tone used throughout is a great showcase for their bright and endlessly varied post-punk tangles. Their nimble songs barely touch the ground, other than the occasional coldwave synth breeze, or seawashed motorik splash à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1316-electrelane/"">Electrelane</a>, touches that make for lovely, errant starbursts in Shopping’s otherwise tightly martialed constellations.</p>
<p>A sense of street-smarts survival runs through <i>Why Choose</i>: The rattling guitar of ""Wind Up"" and ""Knocking"" is scrappy as a young bare-knuckle boxer. ""Take It Outside"" runs on caustic pep, mocking the language of empty threat with drummer Andrew Milk delivering weary pleas to ""break it up."" By contrast, the record’s sincere, personal moments don’t posture. On the brisk ""I Have Decided"", Agga adopts a deep, unyielding tone to declare, ""You won’t change my thinking/ This means nothing to me.""</p>
<p>Shopping are in constant conversation, literally so when Aggs and Milk act out halves of two different lovers’ quarrels on ""Straight Lines"", the second half of a dialogue they started on <i>Consumer Complaints</i>. On that record’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9xlYSwJ5Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""For Your Money""</a>, Milk played the role of a young man hooking up with rich older guys; here he plays the moneyed party, allowing the band to turn the uncertain power dynamic of user and used inside-out again. He reels off his character’s anxieties at the arrangement, concluding: ""You go home empty-handed when you go home with his type,"" but there's no implied judgement of the situation. Shopping’s idea of choice doesn't mean one agenda at the expense of another, but establishing a welcoming space for all comers. It works because their naturally scatty, riotous spark means they could never sound neutral.</p></div>"|20965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20965-why-choose/|7.6|Laura Snapes

The Dutch musicologist Phons Bakx has compiled <a href=""http://www.antropodium.nl/Duizend%20Namen%20Mhp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a list</a> of more than 1,000 names for the instrument, including the English-language terms trump, gew-gaw, mouthfiddle, Omaha flapjack, and marranzano pancake. It's most commonly known in English as the Jew's harp—a name whose etymology has flummoxed scholars for decades. Spaniards have called it the <i>pio pollo</i> (""squeaking chicken"") and the Dutch, the <i>Gedachtenverdrijver</i> (""thought dispeller""). But among its most evocative names might be the Italians' <i>scacciapensieri</i>, or ""worry killer""—a name whose meditative connotations go to the heart of the Italian producer Donato Dozzy's contemplative new album, which is built entirely around the instrument.</p>
<p>It's an arcane concept, but Dozzy—whose most common mode is techno—is no stranger to constraints; his last LP, the <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/releases/spectrum-spools/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spectrum Spools</a>-released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20387-sintetizzatrice/"">Sintetizzatrice</a></i>, was made using only the singer Anna Caragnano's voice, run through kaleidoscopic, dubwise processing. His approach is similar here, wreathing the instrument's gravelly flange in an airy filigree of reverb and delay. Sometimes he sets the mouth harp front and center, as with the opening ""Personal Rock""; Dozzy has described how he recorded the album on the slopes of mountains and overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, and ""Personal Rock"", bookended by buzzing bees and distant thunder, swims in that sense of place. On ""For Arnaud"", the instrument's steady plucks are stretched and warped by subtle delay and chorus effects; the brightness of the tones and the brisk, skipping pulse are light and invigorating, like an early fall morning.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Dozzy opts for abstraction. ""Cross Panorama"" sounds like it comes from the same tapes that yielded ""Personal Rock"", but this time electronic echo all but swallows the source material, and the reverb's resonance throws off great, yearning harmonics. In ""Concert for Sails"", the instrument is nearly eclipsed by the gentle creaking and slapping of ropes in the harbor. And in ""The Net"", short, clipped tones are tossed down a ricocheting delay chain, evoking the influential dub techno project Vainqueur, while the grinding title track might almost be a cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s iconic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5UBYOv1G9A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Digeridoo""</a>.</p>
<p>It's generally a meditative set, and only on the album's final track, ""Exit the Acropolis"", does Dozzy return to the sound with which he's most closely affiliated: Tapping out clicks like 808 hi-hats, and weaving three or four layers of mouth harp into enveloping contrapuntal pulses, it's the perfect approximation of Berghain-styled techno. In his notes on the album, Dozzy speaks of trance states and all-night rituals, and here, he successfully unites centuries, if not millennia, of tradition into a hypnotic whirlwind. Not bad for a sound made entirely from a strip of bent metal.</p></div>"|21020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21020-the-loud-silence/|6.9|Philip Sherburne

The remix was unique, not just because it lingered on DJ playlists far longer than most major-label hits, but because it created an entry point to then-rising nu-house operatives like <a href=""http://soulection.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soulection</a> and <a href=""http://huhwhatandwhere.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HW&amp;W</a> via a cross-generational touchpoint like no other: Janet. That gauzy vocal loop, floating in on an elastic bassline, nudged along by dense handclaps and pin-sharp hi-hats, deaded the lumbering, surly dominance of brostep in one fell swoop. What Kaytranada did with the remix is what Janet’s long accomplished over her musical career: she won hearts and bridged imaginations on the dance floor. It’s playful and funky and sensual; it sounds like something Janet would make for herself. And even though it’s been out in the world for three years, the tour DJ on Jackson’s current tour runs it pre-show.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Probably the only downside to Janet’s 11th album <i>Unbreakable<span>—</span></i>aside from it running about three tracks too long<span>—</span>is that it doesn’t contain that kind of axis-shifting single. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"">Missy Elliott</a> gives it a try, two-stepping in with a squirmy synthesizer for ""BURNITUP!"" and the lazy bass and airy vocals of ""Dammn Baby"" sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31259-tinashe/"">Tinashe</a>-meets-Teena Marie. ""The Great Forever"" and ""Night"" are formally ambitious pop songs, but don’t deliver as much personality as 2004’s underrated <i>Damita Jo</i>. Instead, <i>Unbreakable</i> is a synthesis of ideas Jackson’s collected and tested throughout her career. ""2 B Loved"", with its cavalcade of hoots and hollers, is probably the album’s most ""now""-sounding song.</p>
<p>""No Sleeep,"" the dusky R&amp;B single, is quintessential Jam &amp; Lewis-abetted Janet. A sweet melody and ribald <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12335-the-isley-brothers/"">Isley Brothers</a> sample builds a sultry Quiet Storm groove. Even the silly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"">J. Cole</a> feature can't prevent it from being one of the best songs of the year, a conscious curving of the melismatic summertime bombast of chart-toppers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33095-jidenna/"">Jidenna</a>, OMI, and Bieber. It came out in June, in time for warm summer nights, but fits in better with the enveloping dark of fall. Like Janet, it's timeless.</p>
<p>The story here is love and catharsis. It's her first album since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>'s death in 2009, and the dissolution of her relationship with Jermaine Dupri. The warm, acoustic guitar sway of the title track sets the tone: these are giddy, grateful grown-woman songs. Janet's settled into a new relationship and, if songs like ""After You Fall"" and ""Broken Hearts Heal"", are any indication, ruminating with love on her brother's life and death. On the former she dips into her lower register whilst singing over a somber piano line; on the latter, an uptempo pop song filled with sunny harmonies, she tilts her voice skyward, singing a song of praise about childhood memories and afterlives with an Arabic 'inshallah' on the hook. Jackson, now married to a Qatari businessman, remains private about her personal life but has reportedly converted to Islam. And that one word coming from a pop icon does more for a post-9/11 world than <i>Unbreakable</i>'s social-message songs like ""Black Eagle"", and especially ""Shoulda Known Better"", a start-stop fist-pumper about reading beyond the headlines that's two choruses and a verse too long.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This ability to synthesize what music needs instead of catering to its whims is what has made Janet Jackson an enduring pop star. Unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a>, whose presence and work <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20293-rebel-heart/""><span>open up much-needed conversations</span></a> about sexuality, commodity, and the gendered age biases of pop music, Jackson, 49, exposes these conventions as construct. <i>Unbreakable</i> might be her most demure album in years, but that doesn't mean it's not sexy. Its strength comes from savvy instead of gimmickry, returning to the producers and formula Jackson built her career on (jubilant dance-pop, bedroom R&amp;B, <a href=""http://thehairpin.com/2015/07/janet-jacksons-laughter-ranked/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>that angelic giggle</span></a>). Because <i>Unbreakable</i> is about putting faith in one's career and fans, it plays like the natural next phase in Jackson's discography, which individually might be markers of their time but are ultimately ageless.</p></div>"|21060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21060-unbreakable/|8.0|Anupa Mistry

When Homme's not manning the drum kit or the mixing board for Eagles (he’s produced each one of their LPs) he fronts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"" target=""_blank"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, one of the biggest hard rock bands on the planet. So it makes sense that listeners would categorize the group as a Queens of the Stone Age side project. But EoDM has never been Homme’s show—this band has always been about Hughes, the strutting, showboating, irredeemably decadent presence at its center, the greasy cog around which the freak show turns.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The arrival of <i>Zipper </i><i>Down</i> coincides with the documentary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cy0l6gjoYs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Redemption of the Devil</i></a>, which details one hell of year in Hughes' life, one in which he becomes ordained as a Protestant minister, prepares to marry former adult film star Tuesday Cross, ventures further to the right on the political spectrum (he's a noted gun fanatic), enters a custody battle for his kid, and, somehow, finds time to cut a new Eagles record. The film attempts to answer a question faced by every aging rocker at some point in their lives: when you’ve had your fill of sex, drugs, and scuzz-rock, who do you turn to for guidance? In Hughes’ case, there are only two logical responses: the guy upstairs, and the guy behind the bar.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On <i>Zipper Down</i>, it's clear that Hughes’ certificate of ordination doesn’t exclude him from the party; as outlined on album closer ""The Reverend"", his spiritual leanings are all part of his divine mission to get us all to ""boogie-woogie"". In <a href=""https://theboylatch.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/eagles-of-death-metal-frontman-jesse-hughes-loaded-magazine-interview-september-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a>, he's <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/article/random-rules-jesse-hughes-of-eagles-of-death-metal-2558"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">preached the gospel</a> of pure methamphetamine and public sex acts, while openly accepting the fiery abyss that lies in wait. In other words, he’s prepared to pick up the tab for every bender (and miserable morning after) detailed on <i>Zipper Down—</i>but only once the party’s over. Accordingly, most of the songs aren't about angels or demons, but rather girls who like to shake their asses (""Got a Woman"" and its ""Slight Return"" on side B), girls who like to swing their asses (""Silverlake (K.S.O.F.M.)"") and two-timing heartbreakers (""I Love You All the Time"", ""Oh Girl""). Homme supports the songs with one shuffling, snare-heavy beat after the next, peppered by handclaps and the odd cowbell.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But <i>Zipper Down</i>’s tongue-in-cheek humor belies the dark self-awareness of two guys well-versed in the study of human depravity. A closer look at the puffed-up, pivoting highlight ""Silverlake"", for example, reveals it not as a paean to the fashionable Los Angeles neighborhood, but rather a tale of a wannabe hipster trying to weasel his way into the hotspot-du-jour by having his girl get with the bouncer (""So if you date this guy/ He's gonna let us in!""), only to suffer an existential crisis in the end. Likewise, a forlorn, foggy-headed cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uxc9eFcZyM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Duran Duran’s one-night-stand anthem ""Save a Prayer""</a> revisits the album’s coital motifs through a confessional lens, solidifying aforementioned themes of atonement and reckoning.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite these more reflective moments, <i>Zipper Down </i>mostly sticks to the formula of the duo’s past three albums, frequently recycling structural and instrumental elements from past songs. The haggard guitars and handclap-heavy backbeat of ""Got a Woman"" recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2904-death-by-sexy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Death by Sexy </i></a>highlight <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8m9DNDEU8s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chase the Devil""</a>, while ""The Deuce"" shares a bluesy foundation with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2903-peace-love-death-metal/"" target=""_blank"">Peace Love Death Metal</a></i>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHMEVD7uVXk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""So Easy""</a>. This repetition isn’t to the Eagles’ detriment: theirs has always been a goofy project, one grounded in humor, wit, and sass rather than paradigm shifts. Easy rockers like the sawtoothed, shimmying  ""Complexity"" prove that the tricks aren’t necessary, as long as your hips are moving.</p></div>"|21115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21115-zipper-down/|7.3|Zoe Camp

Ever since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG9pvAUBKlU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles covered the Cookies</a> back in '63, McCartney has been testifying to his love of R&amp;B. ""Smokey Robinson was like God in our eyes,"" he once said. There was a reason Billy Preston's Rhodes solo fit so perfectly in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BmVUxmVBKc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Get Back""</a>, after all. Paul McCartney was an R&amp;B lover before he was ever a Beatle. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In McCartney's solo material, however, you have to fast forward to 1982's <i>Tug of War</i> and 1983's <i>Pipes of Peace</i> to hear how that R&amp;B influence evolved in his distinctive sound. It is within these two misunderstood albums in the Macca canon that the square root of ""FourFiveSeconds"" can be discovered, particularly upon the release of this latest pair of deluxe editions as part of the ongoing Paul McCartney Archive Collection series.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In one sense, </span><i>Tug of War </i><span>plays out like the album we might've gotten had Lennon and McCartney taken up Lorne Michaels' famous $3,000 offer to reunite on ""Saturday Night"" in 1976. </span>George Martin sits at the controls on a Fab Four-related project for the first time since Wings' ""Live and Let Die"" (unless you count the 1978 soundtrack to the unmentionably awful ""jukebox musical"" <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>). The specter of Lennon's tragic death and the unresolved differences between the two lifelong friends loom large across much of this material, especially the jubilant ""Ballroom Dancing"", the symphonic title track and ""Here Today"". The latter is the album's most direct reflection on Lennon's death, and it's a song McCartney has been regularly incorporating in his concerts the last couple of tours. Whatever Paul might not have said in the press at the time of Lennon's assassination, he certainly said here.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The nucleus of <i>Tug</i>, however, is McCartney's yin-yang pair of collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>. Of course we all know ""Ebony and Ivory"", pure ground-zero Macca schmaltz tethered by a goofy yet endearing analogy to the synchronicity between the piano's keys. Strangely enough, the song's message has grown more urgent over the years, while the utterly Triple A orchestrations of the music itself grows as dated as that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crxcy5nmaec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Joe Piscopo/Eddie Murphy send-up</span></a> on ""Saturday Night Live"". The key moment comes earlier on the album with ""What's That You're Doing?"", a tour de force of <i>Hotter Than Jul</i>y-era Wonder funk that can be seen as the ColecoVision to the PS4 of ""FourFiveSeconds"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Some critics derided McCartney for aging gracelessly upon the release of the electro-tinged </span><i>Pipes of Peace </i><span>in '83, right as he turned 41. However, a good listen to the album today reveals some ways it was ahead of its time. </span>With the ballad ""So Bad"", McCartney confirmed his aforementioned Smokey worship by paying homage to Robinson's ""Quiet Storm"" era, emulating the Motown great's cool falsetto to such perfection that Smokey himself had a little bit of a rough time emulating it on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRU_gsiLr20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his own cover</a> from<i> The Art of McCartney</i>. Then there is ""Tug of Peace"", an early, primitive version of a mash-up that brought together the title cuts of these underappreciated albums. The blend is clunky, but it foreshadows his electronic music work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1494-the-fireman/"">the Fireman</a> and on <i>Liverpool Sound Collage</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Then there's ""Say Say Say"", written in collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>. The song was a simpatico matching of minds, combining Paul's harmonies and Jackson's meticulous sense of rhythm. <span>Mark ""Spike"" Stent's magnificent 2015 remix of ""Say"" on the bonus disc of the </span><span><i>Pipes</i> </span><span>reissue stretches the groove to nearly eight minutes, buoyed by a rocksteady 4/4 handclap beat that conjures up visions of the New York City Breakers dancing in your head.</span> On ""The Man"",  the Macca/Jacko duo sways a little closer into Paul territory with its strummy acoustic charm and Wings-esque bombast, showing that beyond ""Say Say Say"" and ""The Girl Is Mine"", they were a potent creative team before it all imploded in a dust of Beatles royalties and Nike ad money.</p>
<div dir=""ltr""><span><br/></span></div>
<div dir=""ltr"">The extras dug up for the <i>Tug of War</i> reissue (the Super Deluxe Edition of each also contain DVDs of era-appropriate ephemera) make for some interesting listening—demo versions of ""Wanderlust"" and ""The Pound Is Sinking"", and a version of ""Ebony"" with just McCartney on electric piano. But those pale in comparison to the veritable alternate LP included in <i>Pipes of Peace</i>.

Ever since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG9pvAUBKlU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles covered the Cookies</a> back in '63, McCartney has been testifying to his love of R&amp;B. ""Smokey Robinson was like God in our eyes,"" he once said. There was a reason Billy Preston's Rhodes solo fit so perfectly in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BmVUxmVBKc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Get Back""</a>, after all. Paul McCartney was an R&amp;B lover before he was ever a Beatle. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In McCartney's solo material, however, you have to fast forward to 1982's <i>Tug of War</i> and 1983's <i>Pipes of Peace</i> to hear how that R&amp;B influence evolved in his distinctive sound. It is within these two misunderstood albums in the Macca canon that the square root of ""FourFiveSeconds"" can be discovered, particularly upon the release of this latest pair of deluxe editions as part of the ongoing Paul McCartney Archive Collection series.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In one sense, </span><i>Tug of War </i><span>plays out like the album we might've gotten had Lennon and McCartney taken up Lorne Michaels' famous $3,000 offer to reunite on ""Saturday Night"" in 1976. </span>George Martin sits at the controls on a Fab Four-related project for the first time since Wings' ""Live and Let Die"" (unless you count the 1978 soundtrack to the unmentionably awful ""jukebox musical"" <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>). The specter of Lennon's tragic death and the unresolved differences between the two lifelong friends loom large across much of this material, especially the jubilant ""Ballroom Dancing"", the symphonic title track and ""Here Today"". The latter is the album's most direct reflection on Lennon's death, and it's a song McCartney has been regularly incorporating in his concerts the last couple of tours. Whatever Paul might not have said in the press at the time of Lennon's assassination, he certainly said here.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The nucleus of <i>Tug</i>, however, is McCartney's yin-yang pair of collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>. Of course we all know ""Ebony and Ivory"", pure ground-zero Macca schmaltz tethered by a goofy yet endearing analogy to the synchronicity between the piano's keys. Strangely enough, the song's message has grown more urgent over the years, while the utterly Triple A orchestrations of the music itself grows as dated as that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crxcy5nmaec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Joe Piscopo/Eddie Murphy send-up</span></a> on ""Saturday Night Live"". The key moment comes earlier on the album with ""What's That You're Doing?"", a tour de force of <i>Hotter Than Jul</i>y-era Wonder funk that can be seen as the ColecoVision to the PS4 of ""FourFiveSeconds"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Some critics derided McCartney for aging gracelessly upon the release of the electro-tinged </span><i>Pipes of Peace </i><span>in '83, right as he turned 41. However, a good listen to the album today reveals some ways it was ahead of its time. </span>With the ballad ""So Bad"", McCartney confirmed his aforementioned Smokey worship by paying homage to Robinson's ""Quiet Storm"" era, emulating the Motown great's cool falsetto to such perfection that Smokey himself had a little bit of a rough time emulating it on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRU_gsiLr20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his own cover</a> from<i> The Art of McCartney</i>. Then there is ""Tug of Peace"", an early, primitive version of a mash-up that brought together the title cuts of these underappreciated albums. The blend is clunky, but it foreshadows his electronic music work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1494-the-fireman/"">the Fireman</a> and on <i>Liverpool Sound Collage</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Then there's ""Say Say Say"", written in collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>. The song was a simpatico matching of minds, combining Paul's harmonies and Jackson's meticulous sense of rhythm. <span>Mark ""Spike"" Stent's magnificent 2015 remix of ""Say"" on the bonus disc of the </span><span><i>Pipes</i> </span><span>reissue stretches the groove to nearly eight minutes, buoyed by a rocksteady 4/4 handclap beat that conjures up visions of the New York City Breakers dancing in your head.</span> On ""The Man"",  the Macca/Jacko duo sways a little closer into Paul territory with its strummy acoustic charm and Wings-esque bombast, showing that beyond ""Say Say Say"" and ""The Girl Is Mine"", they were a potent creative team before it all imploded in a dust of Beatles royalties and Nike ad money.</p>
<div dir=""ltr""><span><br/></span></div>
<div dir=""ltr"">The extras dug up for the <i>Tug of War</i> reissue (the Super Deluxe Edition of each also contain DVDs of era-appropriate ephemera) make for some interesting listening—demo versions of ""Wanderlust"" and ""The Pound Is Sinking"", and a version of ""Ebony"" with just McCartney on electric piano. But those pale in comparison to the veritable alternate LP included in <i>Pipes of Peace</i>. The previously unreleased ""It's Not On"" sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"">Ween</a>, while the tremolo guitar that floats across another rare cut, ""Simple As That"", could be the secret template for The Smiths' ""How Soon Is Now?"".

He’s more than just an armchair curator, though; in the last few years, he's developed both a well-defined aesthetic and a deft hand. Where other DJs seek the thrill of juxtaposition alone, Hemsworth excels at making divergent tracks feel of a piece. Whether he’s flipping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31259-tinashe/"">Tinashe</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17781-blink-182/"">Blink-182</a>, it always <i>sounds</i> like Ryan Hemsworth.</p>
<p>Lately, Hemsworth’s evangelism has found a new platform in <a href=""http://shhsecretsongs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Secret Songs</a>, a quasi-label where he handpicks tracks from up-and-coming producers for an audience of the faithful. He’s built Secret Songs into a sort of anti-PC Music; in place of ironic distance, there’s a loving embrace—the label’s <a href=""http://shhsecretsongs.com/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mantra</a> states that this is a ""friends only"" affair. Naturally, the songs tend to hew to a type, which is to say that any of them could cleanly slot into Hemsworth’s DJ sets. One of these tracks, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/shhsecretsongs/shh008-lucas-keep-u-warm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Keep U Warm""</a> by Seattle producer Lucas, was an early standout, a set of disparate sounds, ranging from wind chimes to cricket chirps, sequenced with the delicacy and precision of a music box. For his latest project, Hemsworth teams with Lucas for a collaborative EP that serves as Hemsworth’s first Secret Songs release. The end result finds the two producers engaging in a generous give-and-take that plays to each of their strengths.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise here is that the largely unknown Lucas often sets the tone. Whereas Hemsworth’s recent solo work favors crisp, clean lines, these tracks tend to crackle, buzz and fade. Melodies waft in as if through an open window and often drift off just as unceremoniously. Vocals are treated past the point of intelligibility, serving as textures that rub up against other elements in the mix. Given the gauzy sonic palette, emotions feel implied, rather than announced—not a bad look for Hemsworth, who can occasionally veer into preciousness on his own. There’s a sort of hazy sheen over <i>Taking Flight</i> that makes even the big crescendos feel slightly blurry, like vaseline smeared on a camera lens.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Hemsworth’s knack for pulling heartstrings remains intact, as does his skillful, trap-influenced drum programming, if it's used judiciously. While ""From Grace"" is the only track on here that feels like it’s built for the dance floor, there are points in all of these songs where, for a brief few seconds, things snap into focus rhythmically before retreating back into the haze. Lucas likes to work with snippets of found sounds and every rattle, flutter, and squeak here feels like it’s adding up to something, nudging the song toward a resolution. Drums are often employed only to stitch together all the sounds floating in the mix, suddenly making you aware of a beat that was there all along. This is warm and unhurried electronic music that's built for Sunday mornings.</p>
<p>At just over 20 minutes, <i>Taking Flight</i> is hardly ambitious, but it's a casual experiment that manages to feel vital throughout. It serves as one hell of a calling card for Lucas, whose previous output is limited to a <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/lucastrax"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">handful</a> of SoundCloud tracks. Meanwhile, a guy who’s made a career out of bending other people’s songs to fit his aesthetic gets to demonstrate that he’s just as adept at doing the exact opposite. And in allowing a less seasoned artist to eat away at the edges of his sound, Hemsworth has somehow managed to bring his gifts as a producer into even sharper focus.</p></div>"|21082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21082-taking-flight-ep/|7.3|Mehan Jayasuriya

This has happened even as the sample itself remains a staple of modern music production: how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30552-young-chop/"">Young Chop</a> has access to an orchestra, how every bedroom producer from Los Angeles to Berlin owns an 808. Those sounds are meticulously recorded and integrated into popular software. Sampling itself—the act of sourcing, manipulating, and arranging previously recorded sound—is more esoteric; certainly there are fewer producers rewriting the history of jazz and funk (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"">DJ Premier</a>, the Bomb Squad) or expanding the cosmic vistas of the dance floor (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26142-klf/"">the KLF</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"">the Orb</a>). The practice remains more common in dance music, but it's still notable when someone returns to the old methods, and licensing concerns crowd many out. Instead, sampling has followed a path opposite that of most musical trends: from the unobtainable feel of early studio instruments to widespread pop deployment to the obscure and niche.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Baltimore's Co La belongs to a shrinking group of composers—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"">Bibio</a> among them—for whom sampling remains a singular muse. His last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17964-co-la-moody-coup/""><i>Moody Coup</i></a>, was a genteel patter that stitched together everything from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ASMR</a>-like frivolity to reggae toasting. His third-ish album (he's had several cassette and low-run releases) and second for <a href=""http://www.softwarelabel.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Software</a>, <i>No No</i>, arrives with a harsher mandate, aiming to explore the banging, echoing sounds of the club. This makes for a louder, tenser listen, even as Co La's methods remain largely unchanged: all of <i>No No</i>'s sounds are recognizable, or at least conceivable. There's nothing truly alien here, and you'd always feel comfortable at least guessing at a sound's source.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Increasingly, those sources are drums, or things that sound mostly like drums. There's a lot of diffuse banging on <i>No No</i>—only rarely does a deep kick-like sound arrive on time—and it sounds like Co La is one of a growing pool of producers inspired by the rhythmic daring of artists like <a href=""Pearson%20Sound"">Pearson Sound</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30014-jam-city/"">Jam City</a>. This manifests itself in tracks such as ""Crank"", which rises from a clutch of voices into a surprising, hands-in-the-air throb, and ""Gush"", which revels in a suspended state before perforating the bubble with rapid bursts of percussion.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course, <i>No No</i> isn't dance music; Co La seems unwilling to commit to that level of structure. So while you could see a deft turntable hand or a devout remixer turning this club-ready, there are lots of potent moments (""No No"") and transfixing loops (""Barricade""'s pitched dollops) that are abandoned too quickly. Elsewhere, as on opener ""Squeeze"", the percussive elements feel placed at random, and the track, untethered, scatters away. I miss the gentleness of <i>Moody Coup</i>, and when the latter half of ""Tragedy"" opens up with a laughing voice and a rich piano lament I realize how stern and abrasive much of <i>No No</i> sounds.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That's probably intentional, given the playfulness that's baked into Co La's methods and sound sources. This is avant-garde music at its core, and the precision with which these sources are treated and deployed means Co La probably has more in common with, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> than with DJ Premier. <i>No No</i> asks a lot of listeners, that we unpack all of these fun inferences even as we're being assaulted by the 143 different sounds Co La casted into the vestige of a snare drum. <i>No No</i>, on balance, is worth the effort.</p></div>"|21078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21078-no-no/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

Williams uploaded ""Way Too Much"", a single from his then-untitled new album, to SoundCloud, only to see Warner Bros. take it down. Without disclosing Warner’s motivation behind the takedown, he implied the label was threatening to sue him, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/wavves/status/621813835523997696"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a>, ""Its so obnoxious to work tirelessly on something and then have a bunch of ppl who just see me as a money sign go and fuck it all up.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On this, Warner was right: <i>V</i> is definitely not a record that’s going to make them a lot of money. That would require Williams writing the pop-punk crossover LP of his career—a little more Paramore, a little less Psychedelic Horseshit. Instead, what we have is an angry collection of songs more indebted to his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20799-no-life-for-me/"">recent collaboration</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"">Cloud Nothings</a> and the brute-force approach of his earlier releases, where punk catharsis was achieved by saying the same lyric over and over. (Say ""I’m so bored"" five times fast and you, in fact, will feel bored.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>V </i>was inspired by a breakup, as well as the band’s hellaciously bad habits: 100 beers and two bottles of Jameson a night for the four-piece group, a period of ""just drinking, straight drinking,” as Williams says in the album’s press materials. Accordingly, <i>V</i> sounds like a hangover. Every song starts somewhere dismal, and ends up somewhere that’s only a little hopeful—a process akin to the recovery from a hangover, when by the end you're mostly happy not to be drooling and vomiting on yourself. Multiple tracks refer to headaches both physical and spiritual. Williams’ budget has outsized the lo-fi recordings he made his name with, but he hasn't deviated much from the core formula. Though there’s room for easy-breezy surf rock (""Heavy Metal Detox""), insistent riffage (""Flamezesz"", ""Pony""), and shuddering sounds ripped from a horror movie (""Redlead""), the predominant aesthetic is dirty and discordant backed by big harmonies—the sweet spot from which all memorable Wavves songs emerge.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s a faster record, too: <i>V</i></span><i> </i><span>abandons Williams’ previous attempts at balladry, with all slow moments preceding the eventual assault. At times, the pace works to his advantage. Williams writes a killer hook, and it’s easy to hear crowds slamming along to the feel-bad vibes of ""Heavy Metal Detox"",  ""All the Same"", ""Way Too Much"", and ""My Head Hurts"". A line like ""I lost my job today, but it’s all the same"" (""All the Same"") is delivered much more happily than ""It gets better"" (""Pony""), a reminder that he’s better reveling in angst than trying to convince us it doesn’t matter.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When he leans into his ennui, </span><i>V </i><span>achieves momentarily thrilling peaks. Williams is a child of singers like Billie Joe Armstrong and Tom DeLonge, pop-punk brats great at sounding snotty next to a massive chorus. The best songs remind you of his keen ability for penning sonically fractured, melodically appealing ""woe-is-me"" anthems that won’t bruise you too badly in the pit. (The best songs were written with the other members of the band, too, suggesting a necessary camaraderie.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still,<i> V</i><i> </i>is a slight regression from the subtle growth he showed on 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17786-wavves-afraid-of-heights/""><i>Afraid of Heights</i></a>. Songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15106-demon-to-lean-on/"">""Demon to Lean On""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwndoAiZjBA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cop""</a> weren’t just excellent songs—they showed the crystallization of the Wavves project into something mature, a word that’s rarely been used to describe Williams or his music. <i>V</i><i> </i>will make you think he’s lapsed back to his #worstbehavior. Take a characteristic line like ""Everything sucks if you don’t get your way"" from ""Tarantula""—it’s like he fell through a portal from 2009, and is back to playing the perpetual brat. <i>V</i> is a perfectly capable record, one that showcases what we’ve come to expect—and in many cases, enjoy—from Williams and his band. Even so, you wonder where else they might have gone.</p></div>"|21042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21042-v/|6.5|Jeremy Gordon

""Baaaaaaaaaaaabe,"" he warbles, his voice soulful, strained and knowing, before he slides into a reprisal of <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/wmstrecs/autre-ne-veut-on-on/s-v9LvX"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""On and On""</a>, remaking the upbeat single into an exercise in jazz improvisation and bare-boned composition that goes just long enough before it chokes out into a sputter. A theme for the album is wrapped within; this set of songs extends something beautiful to its limits and then tries to will it beyond its end. Sometimes to a fault. </p>
<p>Ashin's showiness as a singer is part of his grandeur; his voice has always managed to pull a song together. Yes, he's been lumped into the inner mines of ""bedroom R&amp;B"" or ""PBR&amp;B""–the latter of which is an innocuous title for a genre, an easy way of associating the soul of R&amp;B with the electronic embrace of indie–but he has always had his eye somewhere outside the bedroom. His singing feels directed to a shrine rather than the club, and he's able to emote despair and acute yearning through the rawness of his voice, not in spite of it. It can be unsettling to hear that singular spark start to work against him now.</p>
<p>The disconnect could very well come from the fact that he's now surrounded by a proper choir, and on his most sonically incoherent album yet. On ""Get Out"" he is navigating a track that feels primed for cinematic pop glory, but the song flags as it goes on and his flights of melodic inspiration begin to feel like a parody of a blues singer. On ""Over Now"", a glitchy sample turns a dreary lullaby to the death of something or other into a vacuous wall of static; what is clearly meant to be a captivating mess of noise becomes literally difficult to listen to. ""Switch Hitter"" turns a menacing pop framework, with its elastic guitars and looming synths, into something that feels half-baked. Where these songs hit their most visceral moments is where they can feel their most contrived. </p>
<p>Joel Ford (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a>) and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/32667-young-ejecta/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Young Ejecta</a> appear on production again, but Ashin has graduated from his former roommate's <a href=""www.softwarelabel.net"">Software</a> imprint to a bigger label with a bigger budget, and with that his sound has become cleaner, denser, and glossier, barring some of the organic simplicity that he's benefited from in the past. His lyrics remain simple and poignant, but some of what surprised us on <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17645-autre-ne-veut-anxiety/""><i>Anxiety</i></a> has lost its newness here. The sudden moments of rapture–the ones that that pushed through layers of electronic ambience–remain, but are less frequent and more predictable.  </p>
<p>That said, when it does all come together on this album, it really is quite gorgeous. ""Panic Room"" is some of his best writing musically and lyrically. The lines ""I don't want to feel like you're not here with me/ Even when you say that you are not here with me"" are heart wrenching on their own. Lay them on a wave of synths and the flutter of percussive rolls and the track is as enveloping as ""Play By Play"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14564-counting/"">""Counting""</a> were before it. ""World War Pt. 2"" dabbles with some frantic pop sampling before retreating, underscoring the fevered pull of a line like ""heartbreak is not enough."" ""Age of Transparency"" is another highlight. In these moments, where he approaches the brink and opens his arms to it, the messiness of his intense and manic music mirrors the messiness of life.</p>
<p>The title of <i>Age of Transparency</i> acts as Ashin's commentary on the way we live our lives out in the open, and his music seeks to pull you through uneasy, emotional dregs with its every turn. But what once felt intimate has started to lean to over-exertion. Here we see what happens after the fireworks have burst, when its casing is left smoldering and you're hoping for more. </p></div>"|21044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21044-age-of-transparency/|6.0|Puja Patel

By contrast, last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16495-lawman/"">""Lawman""</a> was the sign of a band that had found their own sharp footing. Writhing, sexy, and strange, the Dubliners soldered frenzied hi-hats to an industrial mess that recalled early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a>, and Dara Kiely had found his yowling voice located somewhere between his apparently unhinged jaw and spirit.

During a period of poor mental health, the euphoria he experienced from writing the song (which dealt with a recent breakup) triggered within him a superhuman complex. ""I had this thing, this, ‘You are your own god, you are your own master’, this extreme idea,"" he <a href=""http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4149339-dis-meets-girl-band"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. ""It was the most amazing feeling I have ever had… I thought I could control the weather. Everything.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Kiely spent a while living in a tent in his back garden, and the episode became so severe that his mother took six months off work to care for him, encouraging him to write when he couldn’t do anything else. Eventually, he had a breakdown and checked into a hospital, and emerged, he says, genuinely at peace. The rest of Girl Band had continued to write while he was away, and on Kiely’s return, he fitted observations from his journal to their squall. His wit hadn’t vanished alongside his sense of reason. ""The Last Riddler"" repeats verbatim the moment where he asked a doctor for their favorite band. Given the reply ""ABBA"", Kiely presented him with a piece of paper that read ""the winner takes it all,"" along with some cryptic advice: ""Think about it."" Elsewhere he’s more fragmented: He ""snorted a wasp and told them to eff off"" on ""Pears for Lunch"", where he struggles with body dysmorphia and has a self-loathing wank in front of ""Top Gear"". Acutely attuned to the goings-on of the natural world, he scraps with pigeons, toys with fetid food, and watches a girl “[race] her slugs to the salt lines."" His tragi-comic tidbits combine to a universal portrait of idle squalor and degradation that trumps his realist peers, and aligns him with absurdists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain Beefheart</a> or cult poet Patricia Lockwood.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Should you laugh? <i>Holding Hands With Jamie</i> is as discomfiting as Kiely’s mental state. ""Pears for Lunch"" swells with dangerous fearlessness, recalling '90s news reports of bad amphetamines that made hopped-up kids think they were Icarus, while at the end of ""The Last Riddler"", Kiely’s screams and explosive bursts of roiling guitar and drums give the impression of a man running amok with a chainsaw. ""Paul"" picks up the conversation between techno and industrial music that Girl Band started on their cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29870-blawan/"">Blawan</a>’s ""Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage"" and takes it somewhere utterly godless and glorious: seven minutes of ravenous, gathering violence comprised of screaming guitar, lurching bass, and superhuman effort from drummer Adam Faulkner. </span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Where this spring’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20394-the-early-years-ep/""><i>The Early Years </i></a>EP—led by ""Lawman""—either went hell for leather or slowed the pace entirely, on <i>Holding Hands…</i> Girl Band have mastered suspense.

They self-produced, and the record often sounds as if it was recorded on the other side of a warehouse wall, like muffled industry contained within a rubbery membrane. This strange distance could be frustrating, but it becomes an integral part of Girl Band’s sound, which feels unique right now. Traces of Liars’ DNA persist, as do similarities to those tireless Texans <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8793-shit-and-shine/"">Shit and Shine</a>, but it’s hard to think of another guitar-based band conjuring fear this exhilarating and volume this rapturous.</span></p></div>"|21029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21029-holding-hands-with-jamie/|7.8|Laura Snapes

""But I can’t seem to find the split between them anymore."" This is the sort of subject matter that made her music popular among her <a href=""http://nicoledollanganger.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr</a> followers in the first place, long before <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a> made her the first artist on her new label. And no matter how chipper her plucky bedroom folk sounded on the surface on previous records like <i><a href=""http://nicoledollanganger.bandcamp.com/album/flowers-of-flesh-and-blood"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flowers of Flesh and Blood</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://nicoledollanganger.bandcamp.com/album/curdled-milk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Curdled Milk</a></i>, she was still singing <a href=""http://nicoledollanganger.bandcamp.com/track/flowers-of-flesh-and-blood"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lyrics like</a>, ""Why didn’t anyone tell me love is like being fucked with a knife?""</p>
<p>Over nimble electric guitar and booming kick drum, her new album <i>Natural Born Losers</i> tells tales of murdering angels, ""fucking the soul of the south,"" and telling your lover he’s going to get fried in jail for his crimes. Like any recording that moves from lo-fi demos to sleeker production, <i>Natural Born Losers</i> fills out Dollanganger’s music, matching the darkness of her lyrics with equally creepy instrumentals, replacing soft piano and ukulele with thundering electric guitar and murmuring organs. And while the music’s simplicity might ring dull for some, it places what matters most with Dollanganger’s music front and center: her songwriting and her voice.</p>
<p>Dollanganger's fascination with desolate Americana imagery recalls other similarly moody, bleak pop singers: think Melanie Martinez’ broken-housewife routine, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33119-halsey/"">Halsey</a>’s tortured teen road-trip anthems, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>’s dark, star-spangled camp. But those singers’ stories still feel romantic, while Dollanganger's music is only inviting in the way the cute, white Victorian house from <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> was at first glance. ""I’ll be your sister, your young bride, your angel, your slave,"" she sings to her vinyl glove-clad, cop lover in a whisper on ""Mean"". She sings of drinking the titular liquid and getting chained up in bed on the fuzzy ""Alligator Blood"" and she’s bleeding to death during knife play on the pretty, minimalist guitar ballad ""American Tradition"" but ""it doesn’t matter, 'cause my baby is still the winner."" Her angelic, high-pitched voice coats every utterance in innocence, a façade considering how much this album loves giving and taking pain.</p>
<p>Her elemental lyrics help elevate her record above kinky bad-girl tropes: With every act of violence inflicted on Dollanganger, she reveals how corrupted she can be as well, proving she’s just as a strong and sadistic of a hunter. She never really lets any of the dark sentiments exist in a vacuum, which is important considering the violence she mines for aesthetic and emotional affect. Dead bodies get fed to the Earth’s starving animals, animals get fed to starving humans; she sees a father’s violence in his son’s eyes and sings that ""history repeats our whole damn lives.""</p>
<p>Her portrait of tortured sexuality and death is tethered to an ambiguous portrait of backwoods living, a North American wilderness where anything and anyone can be hunted. <i>Natural Born Losers</i> plays like a work of wicked anti-pastoralism from the perspective of a bad girl who stares out at her rustic life with not wide-eyed romanticism but sad familiarity and resignation. ""This same place is getting old but dreams are fulfilled where the purple grass grows,"" Dollanganger sings on ""White Trashing"". ""And I can see it all just beyond our window.""</p></div>"|21079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21079-nicole-dollanganger-natural-born-losers/|6.6|Hazel Cills

His productions encompassed everything from Afrobeat to hip-hop; after signing to <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a>, his first two albums for the label were somewhat unsteady attempts to turn bits and pieces into a cohesive whole, taking cues from prototypical psych pop outfits like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5649-el-guincho/"">El Guincho</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a>. His last album<i>, </i><i>Years Not Living</i>, was a more conceptually confident (if sometimes muddy-sounding) stew of African-influenced grooves, slathered-on samples, and his own heavily layered vocals.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Though he’s pared down the clutter and clamor somewhat since his initial DFA outing, Melidis is still no stranger to chaos, as evidenced by the mishmash of styles on his new album, </span><span><i>I Need New Eyes.</i> </span><span>Like </span><span><i>Years Not Living</i>, </span><span>it’s made up of immersive grooves and smartly deployed samples. But the music borders on the emotionally drippy, with lyrics lamenting the ever-present fear of failure inherent in creative work—a feeling he describes somewhat cheekily in the album’s first track as a ""black veil of fail.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a writer, Melidis is often either obtuse to the point of sounding glib (""children are all foreign shores"") or absurdly abstract (""all the tigers breathe with the fires from above""). He smartly offsets his own straightforward singing with vocal samples from other sources, and his strongest songs piggyback off of other influences: ""A Set of Replies"" sounds like an earnest adaptation of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a>' ""Where Is My Mind"", elevated by sweetly reedy details and percussive pinging, while the sugary ""The Sun Describes"", with its warbling vocals and tropical percussion, is a melancholy reimagining of his early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/"">Avalanches</a> rip, ""Contours Sway"".</p>
<p>In some ways Melidis is the consummate consumption-driven producer, whose wide-ranging tastes fuel an obsessive thirst for sounds and ideas: in interviews, he seems comfortable driving the narrative that his music is a sum of influences, gamely referencing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>, Raymond Queneau, Marc Maron, Lucio Battisti, and Seinfeld. (The album’s title is itself a veiled reference to Proust.) He’s an artist who’s attracted to ambiguity, and who’s <a href=""http://www.passionweiss.com/2013/07/11/inspiration-information-larry-gus-madlib-mix/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">attributed</a> one of his most profound moments of inspiration to listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> while in the grip of sunstroke.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Anyone seeking out that woozy, half-sick, half-euphoric feeling will find it all over </span><i>I Need New Eyes. </i><span>The album’s sweeping final track, ""Nazgonya (Paper Spike)"", is a satisfying culmination, a swirling, unambiguously warm callback to psychedelic pop. Of all the songs on the album, it’s the most straightforward, and therefore the most successful. The problem is that Melidis’ ear for busy atmospherics and his desire to say something deep don’t quite mesh; this music is like that huge spinning wheel on ""The </span>Price Is Right""—<span>efficient, colorful, deadening. </span></p></div>"|21050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21050-i-need-new-eyes/|6.4|Abby Garnett

There are theories. A purr can translate to contentment, sure, but it could also indicate hunger, or fright. Most intriguingly, those low rumbles may double as a healing mechanism for cats and people alike: purrs vibrate at frequencies between 20 and 140 hertz, which happens to be ideal for mending bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. If purrs do indeed have such powers, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31319-run-the-jewels/"">Run the Jewels</a>' new cat-sampling remix album could very well be the most physically restorative record ever made—there are <i>a lot</i> of fucking purring sounds on this thing.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Before it became an IRL curio featuring the production talents of everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3398-prince-paul/"">Prince Paul</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/173-dan-the-automator/"">Dan the Automator</a>, to members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a>, to hip-hop heavies <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7025-just-blaze/"">Just Blaze</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/"">the Alchemist</a>, <a href=""http://www.runthejewels.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Meow the Jewels</i></a> was merely another LOLcat goof. In the runup to last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19968-run-the-jewels-run-the-jewels-2/""><i>Run the Jewels 2</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"">El-P</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"">Killer Mike</a> decided to have a bit of fun with online feline culture as well as fan-gouging pre-order-package culture by <a href=""http://www.daylightcurfew.com/collections/run-the-jewels/products/rtj2-the-meow-the-jewels-album-package"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">offering</span></a> to “re-record <i>RTJ2</i> using nothing but cat sounds for music” for $40,000. Soon enough, modern crowdfunding mentality kicked in and a <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1957344648/meow-the-jewels"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">Kickstarter</span></a> raised $66,000 to get the idea off the ground. The way in which this project lines up with the duo's paradoxical ethos, where they're able to spit the most cartoonish puff-chest bars alongside deadly serious tales of death and strife, can be observed in a recent El-P tweet: “did we make the silliest, occasionally most grating possible remix album? of course. and we did it for you, mike brown and eric garner.” (All profits made by the album will go to charity.)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It's easy, and not wholly inaccurate, to dismiss <i>Meow the Jewels</i> as a well-meaning wisecrack that went several steps too far. Even El-P himself told <a href=""http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/el-p-on-the-new-cat-rap-classic-meow-the-jewels-its-a-1733346169"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">Deadspin</span></a>, “I would never even insult the world by saying [the album is] 'good,' but it's certainly the high-water mark for cat-sound records, I think.” So while the way these remixers warp meows, hisses, scratches, yelps, and purrs into passable rap beats is impressive, only a few songs rise above the level of novelty. Part of this has to do with the fact that, you know, this is 42 minutes of rapping over <i>cat sounds</i>, but it's also hard to compete with El-P's original Earth-scorching production, perhaps his finest beatmaking in a career that has spanned two decades. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While some tracks unwisely try to replicate the source material's dystopian energy, the best moments come when remixers go blissfully off-script. Portishead's Geoff Barrow empties out the beat of “Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)”, replacing it with a disorienting, subwoofer-shaking purr, a tiny cat-collar bell, and some stray yowling for good measure—it sounds like what <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjWAWcx4xdE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Grindin'”</a>-era Neptunes may have done with this odd opportunity if given the chance. But best-in-show honors goes to frequent Grimes collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29273-blood-diamonds/"">Blood Diamonds</a>, whose featherlight beat for “All Due Respect” injects some appropriate, non-corny levity into the proceedings, which can otherwise feel weirdly dark.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">But <i>Meow the Jewels</i> isn't really about music at all; instead, it's a major milestone in cats' slow-but-inevitable climb to the status of Hip-Hop's Favorite Animal. In the '90s, I grew up with Snoop Doggy Dogg (whose grace and ease in life and on record always seemed more cat-like anyway) and DMX espousing canine superiority. It was a particularly masculine—and perhaps, um, overcompensating—pose during an era of unparalleled hip-hop machismo. There was a sociological element to this: The use of snarling pitbulls as a way for underprivileged men to exhibit control while caught in an unjust system of power. But, for DMX at least, the obsession could also get strange and ugly—the rapper has been charged with dozens of counts of animal cruelty since his heyday.</span> </p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This century, as hip-hop continues to grow up and expand its borders, the genre's once-strong walls—between mainstream and underground, masculine and feminine—continue to crumble into dust. Run the Jewels itself is a sterling example of this, a duo that could bury any given meathead rapper with outlandish tough talk while also out-smarting any indie-rap dork with vitriolic politics and heart. <i>Meow the Jewels </i>is the result of what happens when cats are afforded more respect and notoriety (largely thanks to umpteen YouTube videos) as hip-hop's subversive streak is allowed to flourish (largely thanks to umpteen YouTube videos). Paving the way to this moment were fellow rap rebels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>—the form's most committed rule-breaker—and his adopted tabby cat KeKe, who released a wild, purr-sampling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48656-lil-bs-cat-keke-the-adopted-tabby-drops-track/""><span class=""s2"">track</span></a> three years ago; Danny Brown and his beloved bengal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51009-watch-danny-brown-discusses-north-korea-soggy-cereal-and-his-cat-on-pitchforktvs-overunder/""><span class=""s2"">Siren</span></a>; and Tyler, the Creator's <a href=""http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2014/03/tyler-creator-really-loves-cats/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">tendency</span></a> to put cat heads on every shirt he can sell. Cats are fascinating in part because of their autonomy: They will most certainly lie down, but not on your command. This is the same independent spirit we desire in our artists. The European philosopher Albert Schweitzer once said, “There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.” It's high time hip-hop figured this out, too. </span></p></div>"|21145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21145-meow-the-jewels/|7.0|Ryan Dombal

It is satisfyingly clean, echoing the bright, shiny flatness of the current digital landscape. It’s as basic as these guys can get, which all said, isn't especially basic: The music feels like a highly-saturated, highly-composed Takashi Murakami print, or a website that needed a lot of programming to make it look as minimal and usable as possible (not for nothing are there songs here called ""Dot Com"" and ""Dot Net"").</p>
<p>They could’ve easily gone in a different direction. After a series of early EPs, Battles had their breakout with their 2007 debut LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10225-mirrored/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mirrored</i></a>, a collection bolstered by the single, ""Atlas"", a propulsive track featuring the sped-up, processed vocals of Tyondai Braxton: part man, part machine, part Saturday morning cartoon. It was bouncy, energetic, instantly memorable, and had an appropriately shiny, cathartic video that found the group performing the song in a glossy, glassy cube. It also meant they had a de facto ""frontman.""<br/><br/>But Braxton left while Battles were recording the followup, 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15469-gloss-drop/"" target=""_blank""><i>Gloss Drop</i></a>. As a result, the remaining members invited a few guest vocalists to contribute: Gary Numan, Kazu Makino, the Boredoms' Yamantaka Eye. The biggest song was the sunny, poppy ""Ice Cream"", which featured vocals from Chilean producer Matias Aguayo. It didn’t necessarily sound like Battles, but like ""Atlas"", it had a great, sexy video and got a lot of traction. Expanding the number of knob turners, <i>Gloss Drop</i> was followed by a remix collection, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16514-dross-glop/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dross Glop</i></a>, that included reworkings by Kode9, Shabazz Palaces, Gang Gang Dance, the Field, Hudson Mohawke, and others.<br/><br/>That’s a lot of cooks, for sure, and when your core group features players like heavy-hitting drummer John <span id=""docs-internal-guid-87dc9972-247c-08d9-e8f4-06ae06b2db68""><span>Stanier</span></span> (Helmet, Tomahawk), virtuosic guitarist/keyboardist Ian Williams (Don Caballero, Storm &amp; Stress), and bassist/guitarist Dave Konopka, vocals and additional hands aren’t necessary. These are expressive, inventive players who know how to compose and execute in interesting, affecting ways. They can basically ""talk"" through their instruments, and it was a good move to strip things back on <i>La Di Da Di</i>, a vocal-free collection heavy on repetition. You might think of Trans Am, Factory Floor, or Zombi, but it’s squarely Battles. The various vocalists on <i>Gloss Drop</i> gave that collection a kind of chaotic or ""various artists"" feel—here there’s a solidity and feeling of forward motion.<br/><br/>It’s at its best early, especially on the almost-7-minute opener, ""Yabba"", which starts with a wash of colorful feedback before moving into a tight pulse of keyboards that sound like guitars, guitars that sound like keyboards, and rumbling drums and bells. (This is echoed in the final song of the collection, ""Luu Le"", which feels like a deconstruction of what came before it.) <i>La Di Da Di</i> succeeds when you’re on the edge of your seat. It’s less successful, mostly in the middle and toward the end, when things start to come off a bit like playful incidental ambient bits or post-rock circus music.</p>
<p>The best songs bring to mind super specific images (here were a few of mine: a landscape of yellow parakeets, an HTML version of the Who, a Magic Rock sculpture, ""attack of the Sea Monkeys"", the recent Earth catalogue sped-up and painted neon, a mime dressed in a rainbow-colored unitard), and that’s part of what makes Battles interesting. Things drag here and there, mostly when they move away from hyper speed to mid-tempo, and when Stanier’s drums take a bit of a backseat to the instruments piling up in front and around them. During those moments, Battles sound like too many instrumental acts with chops, and lose what makes them special. At 50 minutes, it's maybe a bit too long: when you're working with coiled energy, you can't afford to lose momentum. That said, when they're in the zone, there's not much like it.</p></div>"|21140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21140-la-di-da-di/|7.5|Brandon Stosuy

Beyond even the competitive feuding, the best rap music chronicles its makers</span><span>'</span><span> highs and lows, detailing the gnarly realities of difficult lives lived triumphantly. Hip hop and theater, with their shared fondness for linear narrative, should make for more frequent bedfellows, but it took until this year for the two genres to combine to properly resounding effect. Debuting at the Public Theater to raves earlier this year and accumulating hype ever since, the rapped musical </span><i>Hamilton</i><span> tells the story of the United States founding father born and orphaned in the Caribbean, who used a prodigious writing talent to catapult himself off the island of St. Croix and leave as deep a thumbprint in United States history as has been made.</span></p>

The play is composed of 46 individual songs, here split between two discs (Acts I and II) that make up the album. Adopted by Miranda from Ron Chernow’s biography, </span><i>Alexander Hamilton</i><span><i>,</i> the songs are vehicles for Hamilton’s life experiences, and great pains have been taken to maintain the accuracy of an already-fascinating story amidst the likewise-necessary shimmer of theatrical performance. Pairing early US history with one of the country’s youngest musical art forms, one born of the underprivileged especially, could have been as painful as listening to one of your history teachers ""bust a rhyme,"" but Miranda’s command of both golden era hip hop and showtunes allows him to turn the pomp and circumstance of even congressional proceedings on its head.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> Though ostensibly a rap record, from the show opener, ""Alexander Hamilton"", it’s immediately apparent that we are still essentially in musical-theater territory. Theatrical dialogue must be clear and audible to reach its audience—even when presented in song—which denies the cast the freedom to indulge in grand tonal flourishes or vocal tics. Miranda and his cast’s delivery is steadfast and well-enunciated, the flows delivered with a watchmaker’s precision. It helps that the song itself is a bracingly economical synopsis of Hamilton’s early years: The treacherous hurricane that destroyed St. Croix, the letter he wrote  to his absentee father that published by a local paper and caused such a fervor on the island that a group of businessmen took up a collection to send the then 17 year-old Hamilton to New York for college. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Disc one is the more jovial of the pair, chronicling Hamilton’s rise to prominence, and flexing a number of smile-inducing touchtones. Over beatboxing and a drum breakdown replicating hands banging on a lunch table, we get introduced to eventual Hamilton murderer, Aaron Burr. ""My Shot"" is Miranda spouting couplets in a manner a little too close to slam poetry for anyone’s good, but a number introducing ""The Schuyler Sisters"", (one of whom Hamilton would marry and another of whom he’d keep a suspiciously affectionate pen pal correspondence with) sounds like it could have been a last-second album exclusion for one hit wonder and infamous Wyclef protégés, City High. ""Wait For It"" moves with a dancehall lilt and ""The Ten Duel Commandments"" pays homage to the Notorious B.I.G.’s ""10 Crack Commandments"". </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Disc two is Hamilton’s unraveling, covering, among other things, his affair with one Maria Reynolds and the very public fallout that followed and the death of his 19-year old son in a duel defending his father’s honor. Musically, there are direct allusions to LL Cool J and Mobb Deep (""I’m only 19 but my mind is older,"" Phillip Hamilton spouts on ""Blow Us All Away"", a near-quote of ""Shook Ones Pt. II"") and an a capella verse from Miranda on the second-to-last track ""The World Was Wide Enough"" is thoroughly reminiscent of the prayers that used to close out DMX albums.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The<i> </i><i>Hamilton</i><span> cast recording was executive produced by Black Thought and ?uestlove of the Roots, who know maybe better than anyone the intricacies of presenting hip hop over live instrumentation successfully. These are, however, still very much showtunes. An audience for musical theater comes to hear a story first and foremost (they bury the backing musicians in a pit, for goodness sakes) and the songs of <i>Hamilton</i> work to that end with every bar, even when seamlessly formatted for storyline, as in the case of the show’s freestyle battles by way of cabinet debates.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As an educational tool, </span><span>Hamilton</span><span> is a new standard, a piece that will very likely do more to cement Hamilton’s legacy into the consciousness of the general public than any history class ever could. Kaplan would be wise to commission volumes of these kinds of hip hop-driven biographies from Miranda and force him into some kind of lifetime contract. As an album, however, the audio removed from visual context, it’s a lot to digest. It’s 46 songs of verbose, intricately delivered raps, spun from a story with enough character to have already made it a </span><span>New York Times</span><span> best-seller. There’s a lot of ground to cover regardless of medium.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The closest thing to it in popular rap in recent memory would be Kendrick Lamar’s </span><i>Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City. </i><span>Just like </span><i>Hamilton</i><span>, </span><i>GKMC</i><span> is an album that requires time and attention, and rewards that investment handsomely. </span><i>Hamilton</i><span>, though, is an album for a very specific audience. It’s for theater lovers, sure, but more generally for people who probably wish they were watching a production of </span><span>Hamilton</span><span>. There’s an argument to be made that </span><i>GKMC</i><span>’s songs, too, work best within the context of the entire album, as a holistic production to be devoured whole hog. But many of those songs are able to live on their own as great radio singles in a way Miranda’s songs never could. For </span><i>Hamilton</i><span> there is no such debate. You need the whole of it, from curtain rise to call.</span></p></div>"|21122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21122-hamilton-original-broadway-cast-recording/|6.9|Felipe Delerme

Peck pounds her drum kit while Shapiro draws out each phrase, McKenna joining in on the latter. It's a puzzling forty seconds, and at first the track feels either unnecessary or like a joke. But if it is a joke, it feels both vital and too close to home when you consider that 241 representatives of the GOP recently voted to </span><a href=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/house-votes-defund-planned-parenthood"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>defund Planned Parenthood</span></a><span>.  It's just as well the punk trio keeps shouting on repeat as if the subject had no meaning.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ultimately <i>Women's Rights </i>plays like an album created to deflect hopelessness with crude humor, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31990-childbirth/"" target=""_blank"">Childbirth</a> are indiscriminate in their choice of topics, as long as they're ripe for comedy. They'll tackle anything from online dating to Seattle's influx of tech culture, brought to you <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">by Amazon</a> (All band members reside in the PNW). Shapiro opens ""Tech Bro"" with a cheerful guitar riff only to begrudgingly admit, ""I'll let you explain feminism to me/ Tech bro, tech bro/ If I can use your HDTV,"" proving that you can be disgusted by gentrification, but intrigued with its trappings at the same time. During ""Siri, Open Tinder"", McKenna's backing vocals are reduced to the simple instructions ""Swipe left!"" or ""Swipe right!"" only to exclaim, ""Which one are you?!"" upon encountering a group photo. All over the album, repeated lyrics are interrupted with one liners to highlight peak ridiculousness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">However, it's not just dudes under attack here. Tracks like ""Let's Be Bad"" and ""Breast Coast (Hangin' Out)"" – where lyrics like ""Hanging out/ Doing stuff/ With my boyfriend"" and ""I love him cause he's hot"", read like a dig against <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40429-video-best-coast-boyfriend/""><span>Bethany Cosentino</span></a> – are perfect for all the times when perfectly curated Pinterest boards, UGG boots, and pictures of pumpkin spice lattes on Instagram make you want to scream. In order to level the playing field, we're gifted the single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17566-childbirth-nasty-grrls/"" target=""_blank"">""Nasty Grrls""</a> – a laundry list of disgusting habits that ""nice young ladies"" shouldn't indulge in, like wiping away boogers and never washing bras, amongst others transgressions of hygiene. (Hate to break it to you, but we <i>do</i> dip everything in ranch.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Then, of course, there's the matter of the band's namesake. They're quick to point out that once you've reached spawning age, women's conversations are downgraded to a competitive arena. Take ""More Fertile Than You"" where Shapiro outright brags, ""I've got eggs by the dozen and you got none"". But by far, the highlight of the whole album is the hilarious and dark ""Baby Bump"".  The line, </span><span>""I'm that horrifying person from your past/ I'm a party creep/ Why are we still friends?</span><span>"" delivered by a snide friend to an expectant mom, rings painfully true. Those of us who choose to abstain from motherhood often feel we become nothing more than grubby, little deviants who snort coke off a key in your bathroom. When will we settle down?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-32449c1b-24c4-d42c-a10d-a08eebfd52e0""><span>With all of these cultural touch points, it's clear that Childbirth are not concerned with maintaining relevance over the next ten years. </span><i>Women's Rights</i><span> is an album created entirely for the moment, which keeps the spirit lighthearted even when they're dealing with heavy-handed subject matter. You know exactly what they're referencing, and they're quick to make you laugh. The problem is, it's easy to feel clobbered by the album's bluntness and their variety of topics don't differ much from the first record. Shapiro and McKenna's back-and-forth calls get tedious and the feeling become less ""Well, that's funny!"" and more ""Okay, we get it"". But there's a point somewhere in there, too. Women are subjected to such a barrage of expectations and judgements that it's fucking exhausting even when it's funny, and sometimes you have to mock everything because you feel powerless to change it. It makes you so angry that you have to keep repeating yourself.</span></span></p></div>"|21019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21019-womens-rights/|6.8|Lindsay Hood

Bear, with many more rising up beneath them. It was during this period that Tokyo’s Moscow Club started sharing their music online, earning attention for their </span><a href=""https://wearemoscowclub.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>genre-hopping releases</span></a><span>. The quartet also saw the potential in front of Japan’s indie community, prompting them to spearhead a </span><a href=""http://gayveganvinylcassette.bandcamp.com/album/c-86"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>compilation in 2012 </span></a><span>highlighting unsigned artists. “It is so exciting that there are still so many undiscovered amazing talents creating their own sound somewhere on this little island,” </span><a href=""http://wearemoscowclub.blogspot.jp/2012/04/moscow-club-gay-vegan-vinyl-cassette.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>they wrote</span></a><span> at the time.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Moscow Club’s second full-length album, </span><i>Outfit Of The Day</i><span>, arrives long after the community they championed left the international spotlight. No moment can last forever, and many of the bands from that fruitful span have broken up, changed drastically or simply stopped doing anything (Moscow Club themselves vanished for two years, returning this summer). </span><i>Outfit</i><span> features collaborations with many of the artists from that period, and lends the album a feeling of a tribute for a time that slipped away, but also serves as a reminder of the talent that still exists.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Above all else, Moscow Club -- and the artists in the same orbit -- stood out because they knew how to write a solid, catchy song. </span><span><i>Outfit</i> </span><span>starts with “Band Of Outsiders,” a fleet-footed indie-pop song packing every hooky idea it can into just over two minutes. This is the lane where Moscow Club excels, and </span><span><i>Outfit</i> </span><span>features plenty of guitar-anchored tracks skipping towards sticky choruses. They especially shine when glossing up their jangle with synthesizers. The extra twinkle adds an emotional pining central to numbers such as “Carven” and “Celine” (owing to a band-wide interest in fashion, the album boasts a fashion theme, down to the </span><a href=""https://instagram.com/explore/tags/ootd/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Instagram-born</span></a><span> title). </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/fastcut/moscow-club-celine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>The latter </span></a><span>-- written by lead singer Kazuro Matsubara after hearing a Tokyo </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6ndIHcEcaE&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>train station melody </span></a><span>and featuring backing vocals from Amanda Åkerman of Swedish group </span><a href=""https://alpacasports.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Alpaca Sports </span></a><span>-- showcases Moscow Club at their best, capable of a chugging number that progressively ups the drama.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Although hazy, melancholic indie-pop is their strength, part of Moscow Club’s appeal has always been their eagerness to branch out, resulting in </span><a href=""https://wearemoscowclub.bandcamp.com/album/909-state-e-p"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>glistening dance numbers </span></a><span>or straight </span><a href=""https://wearemoscowclub.bandcamp.com/track/echo-beach"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>chillwave</span></a><span>. Their ambition remains, as one of </span><span><i>Outfit’s</i> </span><span>finest comes on the slow-burning “Tour De Moskow.” The title </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt3p-F2x7rY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>gives away </span></a><span>one key point of inspiration -- though, if you forget, the breathing samples throughout serve as a reminder - but its shuffled beat also pays homage to Frankie Knuckles’ “</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIdimVDuSEU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>The Whistle Song</span></a><span>” and nods to electro group </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c639hksrUzU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Telex</span></a><span>. It’s a lot to juggle, but Moscow Club balance it all just right. More of a curveball, though, is “Carven (Orchestral),” a four-minute orchestra version of the more straightforward “Carven.” It’s an interesting interlude, albeit one that could have shaved a minute off.</span> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Outfit</i><span>, as mentioned, isn’t just a Moscow Club creation, but a collaborative effort featuring names central to the Japanese independent scene. Some of them appear on the songs proper -- Eri Nakajima of Osaka indie-poppers </span><a href=""http://wllflowr.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Wallflower</span></a><span> sings on “Margaret,” while Ryota Komori plays saxophone on “Saint Laurent,” bringing the chaotic edge of his main band </span><a href=""http://miilaandthegeeks.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Miila and the Geeks </span></a><span>to Moscow Club’s world. Two members of Kyoto’s now-defunct Hotel Mexico pop up too, although only lead singer Ryuyu Ishigami appears on track, as former bassist Kai Ito provided words for two songs. Yet the names behind the scenes are just as important, helping to write the lyrics gracing Moscow Club’s music.</span></p>
<p><span>It adds up to a very solid collection, and one bringing to mind a time that feels long gone. Western media tends to cover Japanese acts veering to an extreme side, whether that be harsh Japanoise or, in more recent years, </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzC4hFK5P3g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>cuter</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIKqgE4BwAY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>weirder</span></a><span> fare rarely taken seriously as music. The embrace of art confirming existing images of the country -- as strange, as colorful, as </span><span>different</span><span> -- is a disservice to bands such as Moscow Club, who sing in English and don’t play up being Japanese for just that reason. </span><span><i>Outfit Of The Day</i> </span><span>is a solid collection of indie-pop with some detours, and a reminder of how good the often overlooked indie community in the country can be. </span></p></div>"|21048.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21048-outfit-of-the-day/|7.0|Patrick St. Michel

They are a black metal-<i>ish</i> band, but black metal fans either hate them or engage in constant, spirited discussions about why they don't. Their breakout, 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sunbather</i></a>, took basic notions about black metal and shoegaze from their first album <i>Roads to Judah</i> and airlifted them into a rarefied emotional realm where track lengths dissolved into the whole along with straightforward interpretations: George Clarke’s lyrics compressed earthbound experiences—depression, material envy, struggles for purpose— into wild, leaping abstractions about love, oceans of light, tears. This was music that yearned palpably to leap across distances, closing gaps like a firing synapse.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>New Bermuda</i>, if anything, is more overwhelming than <i>Sunbather</i>. The roiling peaks of that album—say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15379-deafheaven-dreamhouse/"" target=""_blank"">“Dreamhouse”</a> or ""The Pecan Tree”—are the resting temperature of this one. They have shaped a suite of songs into one pliable and massive 47-minute arc, one that is as easy to separate into distinct quadrants as the stream from a fire hydrant. Clarke still screams euphoniously, leaning into long vowel sounds and open tones so that phrases like “on the smokey tin it melts again and again” function as color more than as thought. (You could never discern the words without the aid of a lyric sheet, anyway.) They are a band that works best in colors, as the titles of the albums and the salmon color of <i>Sunbather</i>’s cover attest: On <i>New Bermud</i>a, they revisit an ecstatic sound world that resembles, as Clarke puts it on opening song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17629-deafheaven-brought-to-the-water/"" target=""_blank"">“Brought to the Water”</a>, “a multiverse of fuchsia and light.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Having discovered this multiverse, <i>New Bermuda</i> finds them shaping it. The album is shorter and more compressed than <i>Sunbather</i>, and doesn’t telescope into “loud” and “quiet” sections quite as clearly. There is still a nauseous sort of beauty to their chord voicings: the lurches into minor key on “Luna” feel as heavy as their swings back into major, like the motion of a great, creaking iron gate. The second half of the “fuchsia and light” lyric is ""surrenders to blackness now,” and if Deafheaven’s music at its best represents a brilliant collision of beauty and despair, the battle feels pitched at higher stakes than it did on <i>Sunbather</i>. Clarke’s voice is sharper and mixed lower, clawing at the smooth walls of the music like something wretched trying to escape a pit.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The lyrics suggest that this confining space might resemble the sort of manicured suburban prison that <i>Sunbather</i> was set inside: ""There is no ocean for me. There is no glamour. Only the mirage of water ascending from the asphalt. I gaze at it from the oven of my home. Confined to a house that never remains clean,” runs a passage from “Luna”. But listening to Deafheaven, you don’t feel the particulars of this dilemma any more than you notice the pebbles of a gravel driveway from the window of an airplane. The music acts as an incinerator for any malaise you bring to it. It is a warm blur of noise, and fans of many different kinds of moody sensual guitar musics can close their eyes and place themselves inside it: If you have at any point worn a Deftones, Cure, My Bloody Valentine, or an Explosions in the Sky t-shirt, there is room for you inside here. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But Deafheaven reach further and further on this album: The drowsily sliding guitars on the long coda to “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17680-deafheaven-come-back/"" target=""_blank"">Come Back”</a> conjure the easy warmth of Built to Spill. An organ wells up as the guitars fade, like something Ira Kaplan would do on a Yo La Tengo record. The thick palm-muted chugging on the beginning of “Luna” is reminiscent of the Slayer of <i>Seasons of the Abyss</i>. The undistorted downstrokes on “Gifts for the Earth” are a visitation from Joy Division, while the flagrant wah-pedal abusing guitar solo on “Baby Blue” is pure <i>Load</i>-era Kirk Hammett.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All of these references, which bring together many bands that wouldn’t normally have much to do with one another, points to something dreamlike and uncanny in Deafheaven’s grand sound. At a moment when guitar-centric music feels less central to the conversation, and great indie-rock bands have retreated into hardy local scenes, Deafheaven play like a beautiful, abstracted dream of guitar music's transportive power. The year's most jolting guitar-centered rock records have reimagined the guitar's place in the constellation slightly—on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"" target=""_blank"">Tame Impala</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20578-currents/"" target=""_blank""><i>Currents</i></a>, the guitar glimmers distantly at us from beneath a glass, darkly—a distant shape moving beneath the larger, more legible shapes of the compressed drums and programmed synths. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20840-kurt-vile-blieve-im-goin-down/"" target=""_blank""><i>b’lieve i’m going down</i></a>, it is part of a general out-of-time way of life, a devotion to anachronism and lived-in symbols that keeps the confusion of the outside world at bay.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Deafheaven, meanwhile, unabashedly treat the roar of electric guitars as a holy experience. But they have earned their sense of awe, and you can see audiences returning it tenfold in their live performances. The transcendence their music gazes towards has a long spiritual lineage. To wit: I pulled my earbuds out while listening to <i>New Bermuda</i> this morning in a store where Boston's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm_-sW4Vktw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""More Than A Feeling""</a> was playing. The transition was seamless. They were aiming at the same horizon spot, made for the moment when you begin dreaming.</p></div>"|21022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21022-new-bermuda/|9.0|Jayson Greene

On all three of his solo albums—<i>Speakerboxxx</i> counts— he happily explored his quirks, establishing himself as someone more than just Andre 3000's more stolid counterpart. With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14424-sir-lucious-left-foot-the-son-of-chico-dusty/""><i>Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty</i></a>,  he pulled off an incredible, boisterously funky reintroduction. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17294-vicious-lies-and-dangerous-rumors/""><i>Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors</i></a> paired him with Wavves, Little Dragon and Phantogram among others, and if the results were mixed, it was further evidence of Antwan Patton's voracious ear.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Vicious Lies</i> paved the way for this full <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28373-phantogram/"">Phantogram </a>collaboration. The indie-pop duo featured on three of the songs on <i>Vicious</i>, but on <i>Big Grams</i> they hit a bit more of a stride. This isn't a Big Boi-on-Phantogram beats project, and Phantogram's Sarah Barthel is nearly as central as the OutKast rapper as a lead vocalist. The two trade spots as lead vocalists playfully and Barthel's hooks are integral throughout. Barthel tries some rapping, and the results aren't actively embarrassing. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Run for Your Life"", the lead track, is sparse and spacey, and the synth sounds lifted from Stevie Wonder's Moog on ""Boogie On Reggae Woman"". Big Boi's raps aren't deep on </span><i>Big Grams</i><span>, but they are captivating: His strategically fluttering drawl, doled out in pitter-patter bursts, is a trademark as recognizable as it is versatile. On ""Fell in the Sun"" he punches quickly with a staccato: ""I whip the yellow Cadillac, I like my seats way back / I bust the sunroof open, beams hit the Braves cap.""  This track, the lead single, is the obvious standout, and it's here that the collaboration clicks fully. Phantogram's Josh Carter builds up a throbbing wall of synths atop a snappy drum loop, and like elsewhere, horn stabs punctuates: proof, perhaps, that everything Big Boi does deserves a little funk.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> ""Put It On Her"" is one of two tracks on the outing not produced by Carter, and it's certainly the better and more natural of them. (That soulful pump fake of an intro turns out to be a subtle 9th Wonder calling card.) The Skrillex-featuring ""Drum Machine"", however, sticks out like a sore thumb and bogs down the end of the album. For a record that's so smoothly collaborative elsewhere, ""Drum Machine"" sounds contrived and clunky. Luckily it is tacked on the end, making it entirely skippable.</span></p>

Mike's verse steals the show—""Ric Flair'in' / Long fur coat wearin' / Rolex rockin' / Silk shirt wearin'""—while Big Boi happily takes a backseat. This may be a hallmark of Patton's career:  He's continually building up evidence that he doesn't care so much about being the lead as he is interested in being in the middle of something new and different. Given Atlanta's persistent vitality as a hotbed for innovative hip-hop, it's nice to know that one of the city's elder statesmen is off doing his own thing, carving out another little path for himself long after he helped pave the main road.</p></div>"|21166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21166-big-grams/|6.4|Jay Balfour

The recording of that nugget of rock history appears in this box collecting most of Bowie's music from the years of his ascent, so let's take him at his word for a moment.</p>
<p>Imagine that <i>Five Years</i> (allegedly the first of a series, though Bowie has always announced many more projects than he's released) was all the documentation there was of his musical career—that he'd entered the public sphere with his 1969 single ""Space Oddity"", retired from the stage after the <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>/<i>Aladdin Sane</i> tour, and vanished to a Tibetan mountaintop following a loving salute to his roots, <i>Pin Ups</i>. He'd certainly be some kind of glam-rock legend, even more than his friend and rival Marc Bolan. He probably wouldn't have the enduring cultural cachet he commands in our world, but there would still be a fervent cult around his three great albums and three iffy-to-good ones, and even more interest in his live recordings and ephemera. To put it differently, <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> would be the same; LCD Soundsystem wouldn't.</p>
<p>In our world, though, <i>Five Years</i> is only a slice of a much longer curve. The earliest album in the box, 1969's <i><b>David Bowie</b>—</i>a.k.a. <i>Space Oddity</i>, a.k.a. <i>Man of Words/Man of Music—</i>wasn't Bowie's recorded debut, or even his first self-titled album. (In fact, there could theoretically be a <i>Five Years 1964-1968</i>, tracing his evolution from rock 'n' roll wannabe to fussy vaudevillean, although it would mostly be kind of awful.) It was, however, a follow-up to his first successful single, a haunting novelty record about a lost astronaut that had been released a week and a half before the moon landing. The young singer/acoustic guitarist behind these songs obviously has a mountain of charisma, a gift for hooks, and a taste for the language of experimental science fiction, and not the faintest idea what to do with them most of the time. So he wears his influences on his sleeve (""Letter to Hermione"" is intensely Tim Buckley-ish; ""Memory of a Free Festival"" is a hippie rewrite of ""Hey Jude""), and constantly overreaches for dramatic effect.</p>
<p>As it turns out, what he really needed was a good hard rock'n'roll band. Bowie assembled a very short-lived group called the Hype with guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist Tony Visconti; by the time they recorded <b><i>The Man Who Sold the World</i></b> in April, 1970, they'd picked up drummer Mick ""Woody"" Woodmansey, and gone back to using their singer's name. <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i> is the dark horse of the Bowie catalog. There were no singles issued from it, and the title track didn't really become a standard until Nirvana covered it decades later. But toughening up the arrangements made Bowie's stagey warble vastly more effective, and a lot of his artistic risks paid off: the album's opener is a ferocious eight-minute metal sci-fi opus, ""The Width of a Circle"", with some of the most overtly homoerotic lyrics a pop musician had ever intoned (""He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips/ And showed me the leather belt 'round his hips"").</p>
<p>The theme of shifting sexual identity became the core of Bowie's next album, 1971's scattered but splendid <b><i>Hunky Dory</i></b>: ""Gotta make way for the Homo Superior,"" he squeals on the gay-bar singalong ""Oh! You Pretty Things"", simultaneously nodding to Nietzsche and to <i>X-Men</i>. He'd also made huge leaps as a songwriter, and his new songs demonstrated the breadth of his power: the epic Jacques Brel-gone-Dada torch song ""Life on Mars?"" is immediately followed by ""Kooks"", an adorable lullaby for his infant son. The band (with Trevor Bolder replacing Visconti on bass) mostly keeps its power in check—""Changes"" is effectively Bowie explaining his aesthetic to fans of the Carpenters. Still, they cut loose on the album's most brilliant jewel, ""Queen Bitch"", a furiously rocking theatrical miniature (Bowie-the-character-actor has rarely chewed the scenery harder) that out-Velvet Undergrounds the Velvet Underground.</p>
<p><b><i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i></b> from 1972 was the record that made Bowie the star he'd been acting like for a while, although its reputation isn't quite the same as its reality. It was mostly recorded before <i>Hunky Dory</i> was released; it purports to be a concept album, but doesn't actually have a coherent concept. (""Starman"", ""Suffragette City"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"" were all late additions to its running order.) It is, nonetheless, a fantastic set of songs, overflowing with huge riffs and huger personae. ""Five Years"" opens the album with Bowie's grandest sci-fi apocalypse yet, Mick Ronson shreds his way to the guitar pantheon, and the band's flamboyant performance of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v342TST9tFw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Starman"" on <i>Top of the Pops</i></a> famously gave the next generation of British pop musicians a bunch of funny tingling sensations. The whole album, in fact, is as erotically charged as an orgone accumulator: Bowie was probably the only person who could have remained sexually ambiguous <i>after</i> declaring ""I'm gay, and always have been.""</p>
<p><b><i>Aladdin Sane</i></b>, recorded while Bowie and the Spiders were touring their asses off in an attempt to get America to love them the way England already did, is effectively <i>Ziggy Stardust II</i>, a harder-rocking if less original variation on the hit album. There's a paranoid sci-fi scenario (""Panic in Detroit""), a blues-rock stomp (""The Jean Genie""), a bit of cabaret (""Time""), a blunt sex-and-drugs nightmare (""Cracked Actor""). The big difference is that where <i>Ziggy</i> ended with a vision of outreach to the front row (""Give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful!""), <i>Aladdin</i> is all alienation and self-conscious artifice, parodic gestures of intimacy directed to the theater balcony. Bowie overenunciates his cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" to turn it into a caricature of a disinterested Casanova; his sneering rocker ""Watch That Man"" is a better evocation of the Stones themselves.</p>
<p>Then there's <b><i>Pin Ups</i></b>, a quick-and-sloppy covers album that's more interesting in theory than in practice. The repertoire is the songs he'd heard in London clubs when he'd been starting out as a professional musician (less than a decade earlier), and that had shaped his idea of rock: music by the Yardbirds, the Who, the Pretty Things, and the like. (In other words, not so much his idols as contemporaries who found their audience before he did.) But the original versions of every one of those songs are vastly better, because Bowie doesn't have much to say through any of them, and covers up for it through cruise-ship-entertainer oversinging. His art, in those days, was an art of persona, and songs like ""Sorrow"" and ""See Emily Play"" didn't have much to offer it. The band was falling apart, too: the Spiders' drummer Woody Woodmansey had been replaced by Aynsley Dunbar (a veteran of the same London scene), and Ronson and Bolder were gone by the next time Bowie recorded.  </p>
<p>Bowie released six studio albums in the '69-'73 period, but <i>Five Years</i> is a 12-disc set. The <b><i>Ziggy</i> film</b> soundtrack, a document of that allegedly final stage performance that was first released a decade later, appears in its expanded, two-disc 2003 form, complete with a 15-minute ""The Width of a Circle"" and unnecessary Jacques Brel and Velvet Underground covers (still no sign of the songs on which Jeff Beck played at that gig, though). <b><i>Live Santa Monica '72</i></b>, a radio broadcast that was bootlegged for decades and officially issued in 2008, is included here too. <i>Ziggy Stardust</i> itself appears in both its original mix and co-producer Ken Scott's 2003 remix, which is frankly not all that different.</p>
<p>The selling point here for Bowiephiles who probably have all of that stuff already is the two-disc <i>Re:Call 1</i> (its title cheekily adapts the old RCA Records logo's typeface), a collection of material that only appeared on singles. Some of them are triflingly different mono mixes, but there are a few fascinating oddities: both the never-previously-reissued 1970 dud ""Holy Holy"" and the much sharper 1971 remake that nearly made it onto <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, both the frequently-reissued 1972 killer ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" and the just-as-good 1973 remake that nearly made it onto <i>Aladdin Sane</i>, and a peculiar '71 single (released under the name The Arnold Corns) with larval versions of ""Hang On to Yourself"" and ""Moonage Daydream"", both of which were heavily rewritten for <i>Ziggy</i>. Still, <i>Re:Call</i> <i>1 </i>is far from a complete collection of the officially issued recordings that Bowie made in the 1969-1973 era: there's no ""Sweet Head"" or ""Lightning Frightening"" or ""Bombers"", for instance, and it'd have been nice to include the version of ""The Supermen"" that he re-recorded in 1971 with the Spiders from Mars' classic lineup.</p>
<p><i>Five Years</i> doesn't really reconsider or recontextualize Bowie's first classic period—that was more the job of EMI's <i>Ziggy Stardust</i> and <i>Aladdin Sane</i> reissues a decade ago, and their 2009 <i>Space Oddity</i> reissue. (The book included with the new set features producers' notes from Tony Visconti and Ken Scott, contemporary reviews of the albums and the final <i>Ziggy</i> show, and reproductions of ads, but nothing especially revelatory.) It's just a collection of some superb records, and some less good ones, from an interesting era of a major artist. If those five years had been all we'd gotten of Bowie, this would be an essential artifact. But they weren't, and the wonders that followed them make the scope of this box seem both over-inclusive and incomplete.  </p></div>"|21066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|8.2|Douglas Wolk

The band was falling apart, too: the Spiders' drummer Woody Woodmansey had been replaced by Aynsley Dunbar (a veteran of the same London scene), and Ronson and Bolder were gone by the next time Bowie recorded.  </p>
<p>Bowie released six studio albums in the '69-'73 period, but <i>Five Years</i> is a 12-disc set. The <b><i>Ziggy</i> film</b> soundtrack, a document of that allegedly final stage performance that was first released a decade later, appears in its expanded, two-disc 2003 form, complete with a 15-minute ""The Width of a Circle"" and unnecessary Jacques Brel and Velvet Underground covers (still no sign of the songs on which Jeff Beck played at that gig, though). <b><i>Live Santa Monica '72</i></b>, a radio broadcast that was bootlegged for decades and officially issued in 2008, is included here too. <i>Ziggy Stardust</i> itself appears in both its original mix and co-producer Ken Scott's 2003 remix, which is frankly not all that different.</p>
<p>The selling point here for Bowiephiles who probably have all of that stuff already is the two-disc <i>Re:Call 1</i> (its title cheekily adapts the old RCA Records logo's typeface), a collection of material that only appeared on singles. Some of them are triflingly different mono mixes, but there are a few fascinating oddities: both the never-previously-reissued 1970 dud ""Holy Holy"" and the much sharper 1971 remake that nearly made it onto <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, both the frequently-reissued 1972 killer ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" and the just-as-good 1973 remake that nearly made it onto <i>Aladdin Sane</i>, and a peculiar '71 single (released under the name The Arnold Corns) with larval versions of ""Hang On to Yourself"" and ""Moonage Daydream"", both of which were heavily rewritten for <i>Ziggy</i>. Still, <i>Re:Call</i> <i>1 </i>is far from a complete collection of the officially issued recordings that Bowie made in the 1969-1973 era: there's no ""Sweet Head"" or ""Lightning Frightening"" or ""Bombers"", for instance, and it'd have been nice to include the version of ""The Supermen"" that he re-recorded in 1971 with the Spiders from Mars' classic lineup.</p>
<p><i>Five Years</i> doesn't really reconsider or recontextualize Bowie's first classic period—that was more the job of EMI's <i>Ziggy Stardust</i> and <i>Aladdin Sane</i> reissues a decade ago, and their 2009 <i>Space Oddity</i> reissue. (The book included with the new set features producers' notes from Tony Visconti and Ken Scott, contemporary reviews of the albums and the final <i>Ziggy</i> show, and reproductions of ads, but nothing especially revelatory.) It's just a collection of some superb records, and some less good ones, from an interesting era of a major artist. If those five years had been all we'd gotten of Bowie, this would be an essential artifact.

The recording of that nugget of rock history appears in this box collecting most of Bowie's music from the years of his ascent, so let's take him at his word for a moment.</p>
<p>Imagine that <i>Five Years</i> (allegedly the first of a series, though Bowie has always announced many more projects than he's released) was all the documentation there was of his musical career—that he'd entered the public sphere with his 1969 single ""Space Oddity"", retired from the stage after the <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>/<i>Aladdin Sane</i> tour, and vanished to a Tibetan mountaintop following a loving salute to his roots, <i>Pin Ups</i>. He'd certainly be some kind of glam-rock legend, even more than his friend and rival Marc Bolan. He probably wouldn't have the enduring cultural cachet he commands in our world, but there would still be a fervent cult around his three great albums and three iffy-to-good ones, and even more interest in his live recordings and ephemera. To put it differently, <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> would be the same; LCD Soundsystem wouldn't.</p>
<p>In our world, though, <i>Five Years</i> is only a slice of a much longer curve. The earliest album in the box, 1969's <i><b>David Bowie</b>—</i>a.k.a. <i>Space Oddity</i>, a.k.a. <i>Man of Words/Man of Music—</i>wasn't Bowie's recorded debut, or even his first self-titled album. (In fact, there could theoretically be a <i>Five Years 1964-1968</i>, tracing his evolution from rock 'n' roll wannabe to fussy vaudevillean, although it would mostly be kind of awful.) It was, however, a follow-up to his first successful single, a haunting novelty record about a lost astronaut that had been released a week and a half before the moon landing. The young singer/acoustic guitarist behind these songs obviously has a mountain of charisma, a gift for hooks, and a taste for the language of experimental science fiction, and not the faintest idea what to do with them most of the time. So he wears his influences on his sleeve (""Letter to Hermione"" is intensely Tim Buckley-ish; ""Memory of a Free Festival"" is a hippie rewrite of ""Hey Jude""), and constantly overreaches for dramatic effect.</p>
<p>As it turns out, what he really needed was a good hard rock'n'roll band. Bowie assembled a very short-lived group called the Hype with guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist Tony Visconti; by the time they recorded <b><i>The Man Who Sold the World</i></b> in April, 1970, they'd picked up drummer Mick ""Woody"" Woodmansey, and gone back to using their singer's name. <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i> is the dark horse of the Bowie catalog. There were no singles issued from it, and the title track didn't really become a standard until Nirvana covered it decades later. But toughening up the arrangements made Bowie's stagey warble vastly more effective, and a lot of his artistic risks paid off: the album's opener is a ferocious eight-minute metal sci-fi opus, ""The Width of a Circle"", with some of the most overtly homoerotic lyrics a pop musician had ever intoned (""He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips/ And showed me the leather belt 'round his hips"").</p>
<p>The theme of shifting sexual identity became the core of Bowie's next album, 1971's scattered but splendid <b><i>Hunky Dory</i></b>: ""Gotta make way for the Homo Superior,"" he squeals on the gay-bar singalong ""Oh! You Pretty Things"", simultaneously nodding to Nietzsche and to <i>X-Men</i>. He'd also made huge leaps as a songwriter, and his new songs demonstrated the breadth of his power: the epic Jacques Brel-gone-Dada torch song ""Life on Mars?"" is immediately followed by ""Kooks"", an adorable lullaby for his infant son. The band (with Trevor Bolder replacing Visconti on bass) mostly keeps its power in check—""Changes"" is effectively Bowie explaining his aesthetic to fans of the Carpenters. Still, they cut loose on the album's most brilliant jewel, ""Queen Bitch"", a furiously rocking theatrical miniature (Bowie-the-character-actor has rarely chewed the scenery harder) that out-Velvet Undergrounds the Velvet Underground.</p>
<p><b><i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i></b> from 1972 was the record that made Bowie the star he'd been acting like for a while, although its reputation isn't quite the same as its reality. It was mostly recorded before <i>Hunky Dory</i> was released; it purports to be a concept album, but doesn't actually have a coherent concept. (""Starman"", ""Suffragette City"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"" were all late additions to its running order.) It is, nonetheless, a fantastic set of songs, overflowing with huge riffs and huger personae. ""Five Years"" opens the album with Bowie's grandest sci-fi apocalypse yet, Mick Ronson shreds his way to the guitar pantheon, and the band's flamboyant performance of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v342TST9tFw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Starman"" on <i>Top of the Pops</i></a> famously gave the next generation of British pop musicians a bunch of funny tingling sensations. The whole album, in fact, is as erotically charged as an orgone accumulator: Bowie was probably the only person who could have remained sexually ambiguous <i>after</i> declaring ""I'm gay, and always have been.""</p>
<p><b><i>Aladdin Sane</i></b>, recorded while Bowie and the Spiders were touring their asses off in an attempt to get America to love them the way England already did, is effectively <i>Ziggy Stardust II</i>, a harder-rocking if less original variation on the hit album. There's a paranoid sci-fi scenario (""Panic in Detroit""), a blues-rock stomp (""The Jean Genie""), a bit of cabaret (""Time""), a blunt sex-and-drugs nightmare (""Cracked Actor""). The big difference is that where <i>Ziggy</i> ended with a vision of outreach to the front row (""Give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful!""), <i>Aladdin</i> is all alienation and self-conscious artifice, parodic gestures of intimacy directed to the theater balcony. Bowie overenunciates his cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" to turn it into a caricature of a disinterested Casanova; his sneering rocker ""Watch That Man"" is a better evocation of the Stones themselves.</p>
<p>Then there's <b><i>Pin Ups</i></b>, a quick-and-sloppy covers album that's more interesting in theory than in practice. The repertoire is the songs he'd heard in London clubs when he'd been starting out as a professional musician (less than a decade earlier), and that had shaped his idea of rock: music by the Yardbirds, the Who, the Pretty Things, and the like. (In other words, not so much his idols as contemporaries who found their audience before he did.) But the original versions of every one of those songs are vastly better, because Bowie doesn't have much to say through any of them, and covers up for it through cruise-ship-entertainer oversinging.

There's a paranoid sci-fi scenario (""Panic in Detroit""), a blues-rock stomp (""The Jean Genie""), a bit of cabaret (""Time""), a blunt sex-and-drugs nightmare (""Cracked Actor""). The big difference is that where <i>Ziggy</i> ended with a vision of outreach to the front row (""Give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful!""), <i>Aladdin</i> is all alienation and self-conscious artifice, parodic gestures of intimacy directed to the theater balcony. Bowie overenunciates his cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" to turn it into a caricature of a disinterested Casanova; his sneering rocker ""Watch That Man"" is a better evocation of the Stones themselves.</p>
<p>Then there's <b><i>Pin Ups</i></b>, a quick-and-sloppy covers album that's more interesting in theory than in practice. The repertoire is the songs he'd heard in London clubs when he'd been starting out as a professional musician (less than a decade earlier), and that had shaped his idea of rock: music by the Yardbirds, the Who, the Pretty Things, and the like. (In other words, not so much his idols as contemporaries who found their audience before he did.) But the original versions of every one of those songs are vastly better, because Bowie doesn't have much to say through any of them, and covers up for it through cruise-ship-entertainer oversinging. His art, in those days, was an art of persona, and songs like ""Sorrow"" and ""See Emily Play"" didn't have much to offer it. The band was falling apart, too: the Spiders' drummer Woody Woodmansey had been replaced by Aynsley Dunbar (a veteran of the same London scene), and Ronson and Bolder were gone by the next time Bowie recorded.  </p>
<p>Bowie released six studio albums in the '69-'73 period, but <i>Five Years</i> is a 12-disc set. The <b><i>Ziggy</i> film</b> soundtrack, a document of that allegedly final stage performance that was first released a decade later, appears in its expanded, two-disc 2003 form, complete with a 15-minute ""The Width of a Circle"" and unnecessary Jacques Brel and Velvet Underground covers (still no sign of the songs on which Jeff Beck played at that gig, though). <b><i>Live Santa Monica '72</i></b>, a radio broadcast that was bootlegged for decades and officially issued in 2008, is included here too. <i>Ziggy Stardust</i> itself appears in both its original mix and co-producer Ken Scott's 2003 remix, which is frankly not all that different.</p>
<p>The selling point here for Bowiephiles who probably have all of that stuff already is the two-disc <i>Re:Call 1</i> (its title cheekily adapts the old RCA Records logo's typeface), a collection of material that only appeared on singles. Some of them are triflingly different mono mixes, but there are a few fascinating oddities: both the never-previously-reissued 1970 dud ""Holy Holy"" and the much sharper 1971 remake that nearly made it onto <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, both the frequently-reissued 1972 killer ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" and the just-as-good 1973 remake that nearly made it onto <i>Aladdin Sane</i>, and a peculiar '71 single (released under the name The Arnold Corns) with larval versions of ""Hang On to Yourself"" and ""Moonage Daydream"", both of which were heavily rewritten for <i>Ziggy</i>. Still, <i>Re:Call</i> <i>1 </i>is far from a complete collection of the officially issued recordings that Bowie made in the 1969-1973 era: there's no ""Sweet Head"" or ""Lightning Frightening"" or ""Bombers"", for instance, and it'd have been nice to include the version of ""The Supermen"" that he re-recorded in 1971 with the Spiders from Mars' classic lineup.</p>
<p><i>Five Years</i> doesn't really reconsider or recontextualize Bowie's first classic period—that was more the job of EMI's <i>Ziggy Stardust</i> and <i>Aladdin Sane</i> reissues a decade ago, and their 2009 <i>Space Oddity</i> reissue. (The book included with the new set features producers' notes from Tony Visconti and Ken Scott, contemporary reviews of the albums and the final <i>Ziggy</i> show, and reproductions of ads, but nothing especially revelatory.) It's just a collection of some superb records, and some less good ones, from an interesting era of a major artist. If those five years had been all we'd gotten of Bowie, this would be an essential artifact. But they weren't, and the wonders that followed them make the scope of this box seem both over-inclusive and incomplete.  </p></div>"|21066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|9.0|Douglas Wolk

The recording of that nugget of rock history appears in this box collecting most of Bowie's music from the years of his ascent, so let's take him at his word for a moment.</p>
<p>Imagine that <i>Five Years</i> (allegedly the first of a series, though Bowie has always announced many more projects than he's released) was all the documentation there was of his musical career—that he'd entered the public sphere with his 1969 single ""Space Oddity"", retired from the stage after the <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>/<i>Aladdin Sane</i> tour, and vanished to a Tibetan mountaintop following a loving salute to his roots, <i>Pin Ups</i>. He'd certainly be some kind of glam-rock legend, even more than his friend and rival Marc Bolan. He probably wouldn't have the enduring cultural cachet he commands in our world, but there would still be a fervent cult around his three great albums and three iffy-to-good ones, and even more interest in his live recordings and ephemera. To put it differently, <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> would be the same; LCD Soundsystem wouldn't.</p>
<p>In our world, though, <i>Five Years</i> is only a slice of a much longer curve. The earliest album in the box, 1969's <i><b>David Bowie</b>—</i>a.k.a. <i>Space Oddity</i>, a.k.a. <i>Man of Words/Man of Music—</i>wasn't Bowie's recorded debut, or even his first self-titled album. (In fact, there could theoretically be a <i>Five Years 1964-1968</i>, tracing his evolution from rock 'n' roll wannabe to fussy vaudevillean, although it would mostly be kind of awful.) It was, however, a follow-up to his first successful single, a haunting novelty record about a lost astronaut that had been released a week and a half before the moon landing. The young singer/acoustic guitarist behind these songs obviously has a mountain of charisma, a gift for hooks, and a taste for the language of experimental science fiction, and not the faintest idea what to do with them most of the time. So he wears his influences on his sleeve (""Letter to Hermione"" is intensely Tim Buckley-ish; ""Memory of a Free Festival"" is a hippie rewrite of ""Hey Jude""), and constantly overreaches for dramatic effect.</p>
<p>As it turns out, what he really needed was a good hard rock'n'roll band. Bowie assembled a very short-lived group called the Hype with guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist Tony Visconti; by the time they recorded <b><i>The Man Who Sold the World</i></b> in April, 1970, they'd picked up drummer Mick ""Woody"" Woodmansey, and gone back to using their singer's name. <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i> is the dark horse of the Bowie catalog. There were no singles issued from it, and the title track didn't really become a standard until Nirvana covered it decades later. But toughening up the arrangements made Bowie's stagey warble vastly more effective, and a lot of his artistic risks paid off: the album's opener is a ferocious eight-minute metal sci-fi opus, ""The Width of a Circle"", with some of the most overtly homoerotic lyrics a pop musician had ever intoned (""He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips/ And showed me the leather belt 'round his hips"").</p>
<p>The theme of shifting sexual identity became the core of Bowie's next album, 1971's scattered but splendid <b><i>Hunky Dory</i></b>: ""Gotta make way for the Homo Superior,"" he squeals on the gay-bar singalong ""Oh! You Pretty Things"", simultaneously nodding to Nietzsche and to <i>X-Men</i>. He'd also made huge leaps as a songwriter, and his new songs demonstrated the breadth of his power: the epic Jacques Brel-gone-Dada torch song ""Life on Mars?"" is immediately followed by ""Kooks"", an adorable lullaby for his infant son. The band (with Trevor Bolder replacing Visconti on bass) mostly keeps its power in check—""Changes"" is effectively Bowie explaining his aesthetic to fans of the Carpenters. Still, they cut loose on the album's most brilliant jewel, ""Queen Bitch"", a furiously rocking theatrical miniature (Bowie-the-character-actor has rarely chewed the scenery harder) that out-Velvet Undergrounds the Velvet Underground.</p>
<p><b><i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i></b> from 1972 was the record that made Bowie the star he'd been acting like for a while, although its reputation isn't quite the same as its reality. It was mostly recorded before <i>Hunky Dory</i> was released; it purports to be a concept album, but doesn't actually have a coherent concept. (""Starman"", ""Suffragette City"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"" were all late additions to its running order.) It is, nonetheless, a fantastic set of songs, overflowing with huge riffs and huger personae. ""Five Years"" opens the album with Bowie's grandest sci-fi apocalypse yet, Mick Ronson shreds his way to the guitar pantheon, and the band's flamboyant performance of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v342TST9tFw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Starman"" on <i>Top of the Pops</i></a> famously gave the next generation of British pop musicians a bunch of funny tingling sensations.

Still, they cut loose on the album's most brilliant jewel, ""Queen Bitch"", a furiously rocking theatrical miniature (Bowie-the-character-actor has rarely chewed the scenery harder) that out-Velvet Undergrounds the Velvet Underground.</p>
<p><b><i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i></b> from 1972 was the record that made Bowie the star he'd been acting like for a while, although its reputation isn't quite the same as its reality. It was mostly recorded before <i>Hunky Dory</i> was released; it purports to be a concept album, but doesn't actually have a coherent concept. (""Starman"", ""Suffragette City"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"" were all late additions to its running order.) It is, nonetheless, a fantastic set of songs, overflowing with huge riffs and huger personae. ""Five Years"" opens the album with Bowie's grandest sci-fi apocalypse yet, Mick Ronson shreds his way to the guitar pantheon, and the band's flamboyant performance of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v342TST9tFw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Starman"" on <i>Top of the Pops</i></a> famously gave the next generation of British pop musicians a bunch of funny tingling sensations. The whole album, in fact, is as erotically charged as an orgone accumulator: Bowie was probably the only person who could have remained sexually ambiguous <i>after</i> declaring ""I'm gay, and always have been.""</p>
<p><b><i>Aladdin Sane</i></b>, recorded while Bowie and the Spiders were touring their asses off in an attempt to get America to love them the way England already did, is effectively <i>Ziggy Stardust II</i>, a harder-rocking if less original variation on the hit album. There's a paranoid sci-fi scenario (""Panic in Detroit""), a blues-rock stomp (""The Jean Genie""), a bit of cabaret (""Time""), a blunt sex-and-drugs nightmare (""Cracked Actor""). The big difference is that where <i>Ziggy</i> ended with a vision of outreach to the front row (""Give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful!""), <i>Aladdin</i> is all alienation and self-conscious artifice, parodic gestures of intimacy directed to the theater balcony. Bowie overenunciates his cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" to turn it into a caricature of a disinterested Casanova; his sneering rocker ""Watch That Man"" is a better evocation of the Stones themselves.</p>
<p>Then there's <b><i>Pin Ups</i></b>, a quick-and-sloppy covers album that's more interesting in theory than in practice. The repertoire is the songs he'd heard in London clubs when he'd been starting out as a professional musician (less than a decade earlier), and that had shaped his idea of rock: music by the Yardbirds, the Who, the Pretty Things, and the like. (In other words, not so much his idols as contemporaries who found their audience before he did.) But the original versions of every one of those songs are vastly better, because Bowie doesn't have much to say through any of them, and covers up for it through cruise-ship-entertainer oversinging. His art, in those days, was an art of persona, and songs like ""Sorrow"" and ""See Emily Play"" didn't have much to offer it. The band was falling apart, too: the Spiders' drummer Woody Woodmansey had been replaced by Aynsley Dunbar (a veteran of the same London scene), and Ronson and Bolder were gone by the next time Bowie recorded.  </p>
<p>Bowie released six studio albums in the '69-'73 period, but <i>Five Years</i> is a 12-disc set. The <b><i>Ziggy</i> film</b> soundtrack, a document of that allegedly final stage performance that was first released a decade later, appears in its expanded, two-disc 2003 form, complete with a 15-minute ""The Width of a Circle"" and unnecessary Jacques Brel and Velvet Underground covers (still no sign of the songs on which Jeff Beck played at that gig, though). <b><i>Live Santa Monica '72</i></b>, a radio broadcast that was bootlegged for decades and officially issued in 2008, is included here too. <i>Ziggy Stardust</i> itself appears in both its original mix and co-producer Ken Scott's 2003 remix, which is frankly not all that different.</p>
<p>The selling point here for Bowiephiles who probably have all of that stuff already is the two-disc <i>Re:Call 1</i> (its title cheekily adapts the old RCA Records logo's typeface), a collection of material that only appeared on singles. Some of them are triflingly different mono mixes, but there are a few fascinating oddities: both the never-previously-reissued 1970 dud ""Holy Holy"" and the much sharper 1971 remake that nearly made it onto <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, both the frequently-reissued 1972 killer ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" and the just-as-good 1973 remake that nearly made it onto <i>Aladdin Sane</i>, and a peculiar '71 single (released under the name The Arnold Corns) with larval versions of ""Hang On to Yourself"" and ""Moonage Daydream"", both of which were heavily rewritten for <i>Ziggy</i>. Still, <i>Re:Call</i> <i>1 </i>is far from a complete collection of the officially issued recordings that Bowie made in the 1969-1973 era: there's no ""Sweet Head"" or ""Lightning Frightening"" or ""Bombers"", for instance, and it'd have been nice to include the version of ""The Supermen"" that he re-recorded in 1971 with the Spiders from Mars' classic lineup.</p>
<p><i>Five Years</i> doesn't really reconsider or recontextualize Bowie's first classic period—that was more the job of EMI's <i>Ziggy Stardust</i> and <i>Aladdin Sane</i> reissues a decade ago, and their 2009 <i>Space Oddity</i> reissue. (The book included with the new set features producers' notes from Tony Visconti and Ken Scott, contemporary reviews of the albums and the final <i>Ziggy</i> show, and reproductions of ads, but nothing especially revelatory.) It's just a collection of some superb records, and some less good ones, from an interesting era of a major artist. If those five years had been all we'd gotten of Bowie, this would be an essential artifact. But they weren't, and the wonders that followed them make the scope of this box seem both over-inclusive and incomplete.  </p></div>"|21066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|7.6|Douglas Wolk

Instead, Game’s Shady/Aftermath/G-Unit connection combusted spectacularly with the record still fresh in stores and L.A.’s stronghold broke, as Snoop became a ward of the Neptunes, Dre tinkered with a third album we’ve only just come to hear this summer, and everyone else fought nobly but ultimately lost footing in the mainstream for good.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This was the climate that Jay Rock found himself facing when he geared up to release his debut studio album <i>Follow Me Home</i><i>.</i> The album's singles stalled, its release date languished, and it only saw release in 2011, when it sounded like a formalist relic amid the then-just-emerging DJ Mustard, YG, Ty Dolla $ign and Tyga. It stalled at retail, quietly matched for sales (but surpassed in acclaim) by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>’s insular, world-weary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15653-section80/"" target=""_blank""><i>Section.80</i></a>, released the same month.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Four years later, Kendrick is the sun around which more than just TDE revolves: his gold and platinum successes have bushwhacked a space for young poetic everymen to coexist at radio. Jay Rock might not ever be top dog at his label again, but the lessons of his first failure to launch – that a magnetic persona and perspective outstrip shiny celebrity cosigns and cookie cutter image constructs every time – are crucial to the success of the TDE machine. Jay Rock’s taken the message to heart on his sophomore album </span><i>90059</i><span>, which dramatically shifts the focus of his studio work from making him look tough and cool to illuminating the human struggles beneath.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i></a><span>’s “Money Trees” introduce a lot of listeners unfamiliar with Jay Rock’s history to his talents, so it’s fitting that the pre-album single to <i>90059</i> is a sequel: ""Money Trees Deuce."" The song is a</span><span>n excellent point of entry into the new album’s mood; its panoramic view of West Coast street life is more nuanced than old Jay Rock records, and the production freely traverses styles. The jazz rap of “Money Trees Deuce”, Dilla homage of “Fly on the Wall”, post-Dre Cali thump of “Necessary”, <i>Southernplayalistic</i> future soul of “Wanna Ride”, and Shaolin swordplay of “90059” collide, each a little bit of seasoning in this gumbo, as Rock notes on track three.</span></p>
<p><i>90059</i>’s expanded palette allows the rapper to stretch out too, and he dazzles with limber diction and stunning, cinematic imagery. Opener “Necessary” unfurls the story of a drunken drive-by in lurid detail: “On Forgiato rim tire, automatics spit fire/ Yack in the black canister, look at this bastard go/ It don’t take much to aim, fingers be snatching souls”. Later, “Telegram (Going Krazy)” uses an almost imperceptible hairpin slight of tongue (“I see the telegram goin’ crazy/ I tell the ‘Gram I’m goin’ crazy”) to trip off the story of a couple drifting apart because one is freer with her emotions on social media than she is in close quarters with her lover.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Jay Rock’s concepts are braver and weirder here, his words more arresting and illustrative, but the major reinvention of </span><i>90059 </i><span>is his delivery. On “Easy Bake”, Rock hovers around the high end of his register to counteract Kendrick’s deeper, richer tone. He’s singing a lot now, too, and not in the gruff gangster-on-Easter-Sunday mode of </span><i>Follow Me Home.</i><span> The melodic turns on 90059’s “Telegram (Going Krazy)” and “Money Trees Deuce” are unfussed and soulful, while the title track has a drunken Ol’ Dirty Bastard energy  completely unfamiliar to Rock's catalog. The album’s bolder vocal turns are credited to a “Lance Skiiiwalker”, but Lance is about as distinguishable from Rock as T.I. was from T.I.P. or Biggie from bizarro Biggie on “Gimme the Loot.” Cuts like “Gumbo” and “The Ways” juggle all of these tricks to showcase a lyricist gracefully in control of his instrument. It's a heartening showcase, and a reminder of just how much vitality there is in TDE's orbit. </span></p></div>"|21094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21094-90059/|8.0|Craig Jenkins

When we last heard from them, they seemed to be tentatively stepping away from their Catskills-scaled orchestro-rock on 2008’s <i>Snowflake Midnight</i> and its ambient companion piece <i>Strange Attractors</i>. And more recently, they revisited their avant-garde film-school roots, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkVOIYZoEkA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performing live improvized soundtracks</a> to screenings as the Cinematic Sound Tettix BrainWave Concerto Experiment. But given the <a href=""https://lntv.com/en_us/article/mercury-rev-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent upheaval</a> in Donahue and Mackowiak’s personal lives, <i>The Light on You</i> finds Mercury Rev taking comfort in the familiar. The band spent much of 2011’s touring behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15393-deserters-songs-deluxe-edition/"">a deluxe reissue of Deserter’s Songs</a>, and, in many respects, that campaign continues here. But on <i>The Light In You</i>, the proverbial deserters throw themselves a celebratory homecoming after years in the wilderness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album charts a gradual, linear journey from darkness to light, with the first half featuring the weightiest, most affecting songs the band has produced since 2001’s (vastly underrated) </span><i>All Is Dream</i><span>. For the first time in Mercury Rev history, bassist/producer Dave Fridmann was not involved in the recording, but after 25 years of working with him, Donahue and Mackowiak have a pretty firm grasp on how recreate his seismic sound. So even if the opening ""Queen of Swans"" begins as typically twee Donahue ode to a mythical goddess, its helium-huffing chorus is followed by a rupture that sounds like an orchestra tumbling into a fault line.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While that song serves as a reintroduction to Mercury Rev’s symphonic might, they wield it to more devastating effect on ""Amelie"", where mounting string swells accompany a junkie’s plea for forgiveness (""I’ll break the habit/ it’s my last score"") that seems destined to go unanswered; the gorgeous, ELO-esque sweep of ""You’ve Gone With So Little For So Long"" doesn’t gloss over the tale of impoverished hardship couched within. And with the six-minute epic ""Central Park East"", Mercury Rev provide a staggering reminder of what made </span><i>Deserter’s Songs </i><span>so captivating: They conjure a sense of intense isolation amid vast, breathtaking vistas. It’s the sort of song that’s intimate enough to let you see the cold breath coming from the mouth of Donahue’s park-prowling protagonist, while expansive enough to conjure the glow of the skyscrapers surrounding him.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But </span><i>The Light in You</i><span> eventually lets go of urban tensions to revel in the psychedelia of nature. Delivering the sundazed serenades ""Coming Up for Air"" and ""Autumn in the Air"", Donahue sounds like someone who can get a contact high just from watching the leaves fall. On the latter track, he sings, ""I guess this must be what it’s like/ to be in Beatle George’s mind,""  which actually proves to be a relatively subtle namedrop compared to what follows.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-5b4a6c70-1cd0-2785-64c4-eee062b21a4d""><span>In what might be the most bizarre turn in this band’s disjointed trajectory, </span><i>The Light in You</i><span><i>’</i>s final third sees Mercury Rev refashion themselves as the house band on some alternate-universe ’60s teen dance show, complete with exuberant brass fanfares, sitar accents, and bongo-powered go-go-dancer breakdowns. In their time, Mercury Rev have </span><a href=""http://www.setlist.fm/stats/covers/mercury-rev-5bd6ef7c.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>covered enough oldies-radio standards</span></a><span> to fill several jukeboxes, but here Donahue practically turns into a </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X_elAFX2Zg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>pitchman for a Time-Life box set</span></a><span>—on ""Are You Ready,"" he’s getting down to The Rascals and The Pretty Things and episodes of </span><span>Shindig! </span><span>and </span><span>Solid Gold</span><span>; ""Rainy Day Record"" awkwardly extols the life-changing virtues of listening to misanthropic ’80s post-punk on vinyl in the context of a cheery paisley-soul romp. (Even if you happen to enjoy Jonathan Donahue, rap music, and The Fall, you don’t need to hear Jonathan Donahue rapping about The Fall.) In light of all this band has gone through over the years, it’s understandable that they’d want to let loose, have some fun, and reconnect with the feeling of discovering a favorite band for the first time. But as </span><i>The Light in You</i><span>’s dichotomous halves prove, Mercury Rev are much better at being trippy than being groovy.</span></span></p></div>"|20975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20975-the-light-in-you/|7.0|Stuart Berman

The 24-year-old, born Willie Maxwell, is unshakably positive, turning a prominent disability (he lost his eye to glaucoma as a child) into a proud calling card that's already <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6700591/fetty-wap-inspires-boy-remove-prosthetic-eye"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inspired</a> a 10-year old to venture out into the world without his own prosthetic eye. He's from Paterson, N.J., a place we would almost certainly not be talking about were it not for Fetty Wap; he's fiercely loyal to his longtime Remy Boyz 1738 crew, including perennial sidekick Monty, a rapper we would <i>assuredly</i> not be talking about were it not for Fetty Wap. He's almost singlehandedly revived the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM9uL8WG4ZY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ride-or-die thug love ballad</a> with a serotonin-soaked ditty—now double-platinum—that turns a negative situation (having to cook dope to make a living) into not just an unforgettable date but a symbolic proclamation of undying, committed love. And though he's no longer in a relationship with ""Trap Queen""'s muse, he's currently paying her college tuition as a thank-you. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If there's any hurdle in Fetty's way at this point, it's his nagging reputation as a one-and-done singles artist that persists even as he smashes <i>Billboard</i> records. When ""Again"", the album's fourth single, entered the charts in August, he became the only artist in the history of the Hot Rap Songs chart to have his first four singles reach the Top 10 simultaneously. The same week, an </span><a href=""http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/fetty-wap-trap-queen-spotify/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>article</span></a><span> was published: ""Is Fetty Wap Destined To Be Another One-Hit Wonder?"" It's a bizarre dissonance, best understood as such: those four charting singles, addictive as they are, don't do much to break the mold of what we've come to expect from a Fetty Wap song. Which is to say: generous Auto-Tune, exuberant melodies, and a lot of warbled </span><span>""Yeaaaaaaaa baby""</span><span>s and </span><span>""1738""</span><span>s. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>With </span><i>Fetty Wap</i><span>, released through the tech-savvy but still-transitional 300 Entertainment imprint, the </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7gcOTlS60M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>rappa-turnt-sanga</span></a><span> finally has the platform to show he's more than a singles guy. To that end, he put out a 20-song album with no new friends and no big-name producers—in short, this is the album he probably would have made with his RGF Productions squad in Paterson were there no label involved at all. Those looking for a new direction from Fetty, or who've already mined the depths of his prolific </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/harlem_fetty/tracks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>SoundCloud</span></a><span>, may find this a letdown. But those who've embraced his loyalty and radical self-love should be delighted: Is there a more quintessentially Fetty Wap move than turning the year's biggest major label rap debut into a self-directed Paterson block party?</span></p>
<p>The first thing you might notice on <i>Fetty Wap</i>'s tracklist isn't what's there—if you've kept up with his output over the last year and a half, there's a lot you'll recognize here—but who isn't. <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>'s hastily added guest verse to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59494-drake-remixes-fetty-waps-my-way/"">""My Way""</a> from earlier this year is missing; the album version features a verse from Remy Boyz' Monty, who appears on nine of the album's 20 tracks, the only guest aside from relatively unknown M80. As a whole, <i>Fetty Wap</i> adopts the same self-assured stance: Fetty's formula definitely ain't broke, and he doesn't seem in a hurry to fix it. In what can only be described as a flex, he opens the album with ""Trap Queen"", a seemingly audacious move he knows full well he can back up. Why coyly tease out your first and biggest hit when you've got 19 more just like it?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That's the thing: you could shuffle these tracks endlessly and the album would probably have the same effect. It's not that there are any missteps here, really; if you like what you've already heard from Fetty, you'll like these songs. There are variations, to be sure—second single ""679"" borrows some West Coast bounce, functioning as a clubby palate cleanser in the way that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsVnUpl2IKQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fight Night""</a> did for <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>. ""I Wonder"" and ""Boomin"" successfully skulk into drill's shadowy corners. But for the most part, Fetty doesn't venture too far outside his comfort zone.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, when the highs are this high, it's hard to complain. ""My Way"" is still 2015's ultimate trap lullaby, lilting in hypnotic spirals. ""RGF Island"" turns somber keys into a hard-earned celebration, and ""I'm Straight"" dials the exuberance further up with triumphant steel drums. And though he's a much more natural singer, ""Again"" is Fetty's best rap performance. ""I'm tryna finish who I started with/ I'm tryna spend it all who I got it with,"" he crows, reassuring his fed-up trap queen that his crazy life will all be worth it when they can enjoy it together. Fetty approaches everything in his music with the earnest devotion of matrimony: his trap queen, his money, his beloved Remy Boyz. So though it's tempting to wonder what may have happened had 300 recruited labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> or Quavo, or beatmakers <i>du jour</i> like Metro Boomin or Zaytoven, it's only right Fetty insisted on keeping things in the 1738 family.</p></div>"|21043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21043-fetty-wap/|7.6|Meaghan Garvey

This<i> </i>is a tense, terse concept album: The tracks roll forward in one dark, uniform palette, each providing a different answer to a single line of questioning, as laid out by Simz in the opening track. Technically, she’s phenomenal: She revs up almost off-handedly, like she’s jumping rope, and she seamlessly shifts in and out of her singing voice like <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>. Twinning her meter almost classically, she spits: ""They told her women cannot call themselves kings/ They told her fame isn’t made for everyone.""</p>
<p>The album that follows is, in effect, a snarling refutation. She might not be a king, but she is certainly a prince, with cosigns from <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"">A$AP Rocky</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"">J. Cole</a>, among others. She’s got fame in her crosshairs, and likely the other way around, too, but the defining note of<i> Trials + Persons</i> is one of ambivalence. Simz seems engaged with the naysayers—""This the type of music that ain’t never gonna sell/ Well, you should’ve never ever told me that,"" she repeats, in two separate songs—but her real fight is within herself. At 21, she raps with a shapeshifting hardness and ragged sense of spiritual burden that brings to mind <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1944-lauryn-hill/"">Lauryn Hill</a>, and Kendrick too.</p>
<p><i>Trials + Persons</i> was recorded for free in the London Red Bull studio, and released on Simz' own label, Age 101, a corporate liberation that allowed her to make this 35-minute debut essentially hit one reverberating note. With the bigger producers and broader hooks a label might’ve asked for—even a single bright major chord, just once—Simz, an explosively skilled rapper, could’ve landed straight in the center. But instead, she’s keeping her talent under her own strict control, which means, by one calculus, curbing it. Instead of an album spiked with a big banging single, she offers a looping, obsessively focused experience, with her words providing structure and the pulsing orchestral instrumentation coming second. With a few exceptions, like the unprocessed drums and whining electric guitar on ""Full or Empty"", the album is a fugue state, unbroken and undifferentiated. It’s dark, but not impenetrable; Simz’s charisma keeps it lit in here, like headlights barreling around the corners of a dark room.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a writer, though, Simz is less virtuosic. The album’s language is intelligent but wholly straightforward, rarely witty and almost device-less; Simz always says exactly what she means. She’s an original in stance, then, rather than substance or specifics, turning over her central dilemma from different angles, switching between personas from song to song. In ""Gratitude"", she imagines herself stuck at home with children; in ""Tainted"" (her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZW7et3tPuQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Backseat Freestyle""</a>), she introduces her character and then jumps into a voice of a stone-cold, dead-eyed, alpha bitch. ""God Bless Mary"" is dedicated to her aggrieved neighbor (though it carries that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktgHNJ4RmIY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Zion""</a>-esque double reading), and it takes palpable effort for Simz to step outside herself; she can conjecture nothing about Mary’s life except the woman’s reaction to this record.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""> In a way, the album feels radically personal: Simz is her own primary subject, and as a result is necessarily exposed. But the soul of the album is abstracted.

He’s most notable for his tenure in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3408-psychic-tv/"">Psychic TV</a> in the '80s and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a> in the '90s, during which time he honed his craft as a manipulator of synthesizers, samples, and esoteric sounds. One thing he’s never done, though, is release a solo album—that is, until now. <i>Collapse </i>is McDowall’s debut full-length under his own name, arriving 37 years after the first recorded appearance by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxqmJ7WhexI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Poems</a>, the Scottish punk band he formed with his then wife, and future Strawberry Switchblade member, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33099-rose-mcdowall/"">Rose McDowall</a>.</p>
<p>It’s been a long journey from teen punk to avant-industrial vet, but on <i>Collapse</i>, McDowall sounds anything but spent. The album’s five tracks—instrumental, save for a smatter of vocal samples—tap into the same deep wellspring of ritual, apocalypse, and neopagan awe that fueled Coil, only with a fuller and more focused sense of dread. Nowhere is that as evident as on ""The Chimeric Mesh Withdraws (Parts 1-3)"", the 20-minute triptych that anchors <i>Collapse </i>with an arcane gravitas straight out of McDowall’s greatest achievement with Coil, 1999’s <i>Astral Disaster</i>. But where <i>Astral Disaster</i> folds ambience and emptiness into its spellbinding substance, ""Chimeric Mesh"" wields those elements like hammers. The result is cinematic, insectoid, and foreboding, even as it morphs gently from movement to movement in a fugue of skittering static and fractured blocks of noise.</p>
<p>Another through line of McDowall’s work over the years is psychedelia, inasmuch as it intersects with the finer pulverization of industrial. ""Hypnotic Congress"" takes a while to settle into its mesmeric groove, but when it does, its rhythmic cascade of echoing pulses, looped chants, and submarine blips segues into a mind-dissolving wash. There’s a ceremonially circularity to ""Through Is Out"" and ""Each Surface of Night"", each of which phases into a sequence of krautrock-like pings and oscillations by song’s end—<a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2012/06/q-a-with-coils-drew-mcdowall.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">McDowall has admitted</a> to being warped at the age of 12 by an impulse purchase of <i>The Faust Tapes</i>—that tensely countermands their eerily organic, almost folk-like undertones. But the most starkly psychedelic stretch of <i>Collapse</i> is ""Convulse"", a staccato salvo of hollowed-out power electronics whose chilling sampled voice—""I convulsed,"" intones a woman, clinically—comes across like a radical dub reworking of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a>’s ""She’s Lost Control"", told from the perspective of the song’s subject, and played at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>In recent years, McDowall has collaborated with numerous artists, including Tres Warren of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3486-psychic-ills/"">Psychic Ills</a> in the blissful drone project <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUaDuvEubRw&amp;list=PL-iw--mMCQ3JOylDg8gh-G0x2ncScDKHF"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Compound Eye</a>. On <i>Collapse</i>, McDowall is joined by Nicky Mao (of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28820-effi-briest/"">Effi Briest</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32433-hiro-kone/"">Hiro Kone</a>), who contributes violin, unspecified samples, and splices to the album’s beckoning mix of recursion and unease. In any case, those contributions are seamless; as a whole, the collection comes across as a unified meditation that channels an atmosphere of doom, morbid curiosity, and the perplexing pluralism of modernity. It’s also frequently beautiful, even if that beauty is undermined by a vagueness that might have been more sharply defined by wider dynamics. As a solo statement, though, <i>Collapse</i> is a winner—a field recording of the psyche of an extreme-music journeyman who’s finally started to settle in and harness his own dark voice.</p></div>"|21077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21077-collapse/|6.8|Jason Heller

Both bands have roots in blues, both have a fondness for topping caramel-sweet melodies with gravel and tacks, and both know precisely how to ride the edge of bombast and camp without ever becoming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1191-the-darkness/"">the Darkness</a>. On their fourth album, Graveyard root around even deeper in their record collections. In the kind of quote that becomes instantly regrettable, frontman Joakim Nilsson once said that he wanted the band to be a mix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"">Slayer</a> and Howlin’ Wolf, but on <i>Innocence &amp; Decadence, </i>they also find room for Motown, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Dylan</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12927-queen/"">Queen</a>. What makes the record work is the way they synthesize all of this into something that is swell-chested, triumphant, and surprisingly <i>human</i>, dosing each song with equal amounts of swagger and charm. In a genre that often prides itself on being forbidding, <i>Innocence</i> is a proudly welcoming metal record, throwing open its tattooed arms and carrying off even the darker material with a wink and a smile.</p>
<p>That all-in m.o. is evident from the outset. Opener ""Magnetic Shunk"" rides in on a deep-set, galloping blues groove, Nilsson’s eye on a woman at the far end of the bar. Instead of shaming or objectifying her for her sexual experience, Nilsson celebrates it—""It’s nobody’s business who you give your kiss""—before devising an almost comically ridiculous come-on: ""No need to be gentle, baby, I like it raw/ Treat me like I was crime and you are the law."" That kind of loopy wordplay turns up throughout <i>Innocence</i>; on ""The Apple &amp; the Tree"", whose wandering guitar lead sounds like a distant cousin to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Along the Watchtower""</a>, Nilsson opens singing, ""I remember the days I don’t recall."" Before the absurdity of the line can be fully absorbed, he’s skated clean into the song’s slow-winding chorus (the lyrics of which suggest the title’s apple might be the same one that turned up in Genesis Chapter 2). The hard-charging ""Never Theirs to Sell"" is a lean, mean-eyed, fist-pumping anthem of defiance, opening into a double-time, soul-clap break about halfway through that imagines Angus Young sitting in with the MGs.</p>
<p>Though the twin themes in the album’s title turn up in most of its songs, it’s the former that gets the most airtime. On the breathless, roller-coastering ""From a Hole in the Wall"", while low-end guitars pummel like rubber bullets, bassist Truls Morck sings, ""Can you hear a big bird singing somewhere in the back of your mind?/ It’s loud enough to make you wonder/ ‘Can I please hear it one more time?’"" Lines like this contribute to the album’s odd sense of sweetness—youth isn’t fetishized as a period of penalty-free rule-breaking, but considered wistfully, as a time of almost ceramic cleanness, before things like pain and disappointment became everyday occurrences. That same sentiment is given flesh, blood, and a broken heart in the straight-up soul ballad ""Too Much Is Not Enough"", which wouldn’t sound entirely out of place on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/"">Amy Winehouse</a> B-sides comp. Over a wood-fired blues lick, Nilsson mournfully watches a longtime lover walk out the door, before concluding, ""I know you tried to keep us together/ But in the end, there was nothing left to keep."" The gospel trio that parenthesize his verses provides the necessary dramatic flourish.</p>
<p><i>Innocence</i> was recorded at Atlantis Grammofon Studios in Stockholm, which is the same place <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6-abba/"">ABBA</a> recorded their earliest material. While it’s not quite the same deep-dive into confectionary pop, <i>Innocence</i> shares both that group’s fondness for immediate melodies and their egalitarian spirit. Theirs is a club where you might get lucky, you might burn the night philosophizing, or you might reconnect with old friends. Best of all, it has a decidedly low barrier of entry: If you’ve ever nursed a drink while thinking misty-eyed about the good old days, you’re in.</p></div>"|20914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20914-innocence-decadence/|7.4|J.

As more and more bands in the extended <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a> family have made use of Justin Vernon’s April Base studio in the tiny village of Fall Creek, Wis., the location and the sensibilities of the musicians who overlap on these releases (and sleep there in bunk beds while recording) have begun to create a distinct sound. April Base seems like a place you’d find locally made art on the walls, Bruce Hornsby on the turntable, and half-eaten bags of trail mix on the counters. In the same way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30501-matthew-e-white/"">Matthew E. White</a>'s <a href=""http://spacebombrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spacebomb</a> house band stamps its records with vintage-horn-section grandiosity, April Base recordings tend to have a liquid, woodsy aura like the one Vernon debuted on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/""><span class=""s1""><i>Bon Iver</i></span></a> in 2011.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Enter Doe Paoro, who turned heads with her smoky, soulful voice on 2012 debut <a href=""https://doepaoro.bandcamp.com/album/slow-to-love"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1""><i>Slow to Love</i></span></a>, which she wrote on a Vernon-esque cabin retreat outside Syracuse, N.Y. Though she didn’t know Vernon, when it came time to record a new batch of songs, she reached out to him, and he ended up producing her single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17478-doe-paoro-the-wind/"">""The Wind""</a> and also introduced her to the production team of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28938-s-carey/"">S. Carey</a> and BJ Burton, who has produced, engineered, or mixed several others in the extended family (Carey, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27996-volcano-choir/"">Volcano Choir</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"">Colin Stetson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"">Megafaun</a>). Burton, who also produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a>’s recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20982-ones-and-sixes/""><span class=""s1""><i>Ones and Sixes</i></span></a><i> </i>in Wisconsin, wisely realized it wouldn’t make sense to give Low the heavy duty cycle of April Base’s sonic wash, which can be dialed up (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18447-volcano-choir-repave/""><span class=""s1""><i>Repave</i></span></a>) or down (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19143-s-carey-range-of-light/""><span class=""s1""><i>Range of Light</i></span></a>). For <i>After</i>, Doe Paoro gets the full-on Wilson Phillips-in-the-woods treatment. It fits her just right.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A lot of the conversation surrounding Paoro (real name Sonia Kreitzer) has focused on her time in Tibet and her study of Lhamo, an ancient form of Tibetan folk opera. But rather than a direct influence on her sound, Lhamo seems to represent one of the many ways Doe experiments with form. On <i>After</i>, she’s not tied to a specific song structure or genre just as she’s not easily described by one type of vocal tradition. Vintage and modern R&amp;B, soul, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/116-fiona-apple/"">Fiona Apple</a>, and '80s synth-pop all commingle. </p>
<p class=""p1"">When Paoro originally released ""Traveling"", it was a minimalist <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=199XS8ucYiM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performance video</a> with just Paoro on vocals and Guy Blakeslee of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28085-the-entrance-band/"">Entrance Band</a> on guitar, but on <i>After</i>, the guitar is subbed for coughing woodwinds, muted synths, and processed keys. ""Silence can be so loud, it’s abrasive,"" she sings, countering any preconceived, romantic notion of isolation. Holing up in a cabin can block out the din of humanity, but that withdrawal can also amplify your own thoughts, making them louder than you ever imagined. ""I wanted solitude and that’s what I got/ Now I’m a living island with only one thought: Maybe I was wrong,"" she sings as organ and the April Base horn section swell and those <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkADj0TPrJA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""In the Air Tonight""</a> drums kick in.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Either version of ""Traveling"" is a winner, and that malleability makes Doe Paoro something special. While there’s a familiarity to the production of Carey and Burton, the backdrops they create for Paoro are experimental and filled with surprises. Drums disappear as quickly as they appear. Pulsing bass drives ""Nostalgia"", while the patiently paced ""Outlines"" finds Paoro alone with a piano, pausing between bluesy phrases and relishing her chance to take center stage as a damaged but defiant torch singer. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As much as the producers and collection of studio musicians imprint <i>After</i>, their influence wouldn’t allow just any songwriter to shine. Paoro, alongside co-writers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5706-peter-moren/"">Peter Morén</a> and Adam Rhodes, uses the album to reckon with loss and all of its implications, especially as it relates to time—knowing that you’re knee-deep in the aftermath, but not yet on the precipice of something else. The future is a bunch of white space, neither something to get excited about nor dread. So what do you do with the present? Well, for one, you don’t dwell on the past. ""Nostalgia is killing us,"" Paoro sings. And on ""Hypotheticals"", she realizes questions like ""What’s fair?"" aren’t even worth answering. ""I won’t indulge in hypotheticals,"" she spits out in a blast, turning something that could be a tossed-off sound bite from an Aaron Sorkin drama into a charged, anthemic refusal to let someone else change her story. Making peace with something as painful as loss is a messy task. <i>After</i> is a confident, beautiful, clear-eyed testament to that mess.</p></div>"|21065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21065-after/|7.4|Joel Oliphint

Because whenever White steps behind the drum kit of this scuzz-rock supergroup, he hits with a crazed intensity that suggests he’s looking to pound a different sort of skin. Since the release of the band’s previous album, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14237-sea-of-cowards/""><i>Sea of Cowards</i></a>, White has embarked on a solo career that’s seen his work turn both more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16534-blunderbuss/"">intimate</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19420-jack-white-lazaretto/"">extravagant</a>; in this light, the Dead Weather have come to represent the hanging side of beef on which he can unleash his pent-up aggression.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tellingly, White and his mates—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2288-the-kills/"">Kills</a> vocalist Alison Mosshart, City and Colour bassist Jack Lawrence, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> guitarst/keyboardist Dean Fertita—have announced they have no plans to tour in support of <i>Dodge and Burn</i>. This news would reinforce the notion that this group essentially functions as an exorcism of its members’ most feral tendencies before they return to their day jobs. Theirs is a blues defined not by chord progressions but physical reactions, embodying the music’s storied tradition of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEjUfu9-W-w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>howls</span></a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3yd-c91ww8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>moans</span></a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MCHI23FTP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>demonic possession</span></a> into a fierce, physical sound. There’s a restlessness to <i>Dodge and Burn</i>, from Mosshart’s seething vocals and Fertita’s spasmodic guitar solos to Lawrence’s corroded basslines to White’s abrupt breakdowns. Even when songs are built around a shopworn sentiment, they’re given a twist: on the opening ""I Feel Love"", Mosshart answers the song’s titular declaration with a withering ""every once in a while.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Dead Weather’s cabin-in-the-woods creepiness can verge on the contrived—like on ""Three Dollar Hat"", where White makes like a young Isaac Brock taking on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"">Nick Cave</a>’s ""Stagger Lee"", and losing. But the band’s theatricality mostly complements the agitated tone of the songs and the dubby, dread-of-night ambiance of White’s production, particularly in those moments when Mosshart and White go head-to-head. The mid-album knockout ""Rough Detective"" sees the two trading verses and pushing one another to hysterical extremes; instead of dropping the typical guitar solo after the second shout-it-out chorus, the song yields a carnival-like melee of chopped-up chatter and pitch-shifted squeals. And when White asks, ""what’s happening?"", he sounds genuinely spooked by the song’s sudden descent into madness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like its predecessors, </span><i>Dodge and Burn</i><span> can leave you wishing for more interaction between the two leads—</span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7QSkI6My1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the</a> </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0YI0UUazkU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>duets</span></a><span> are always the highlight of any given Dead Weather record, the moment when all that simmering tension boils over. But Mosshart once again handles the heavy vocal lifting with menace to spare, be it the frisky sing-speak of ""Mile Markers"", the predatory soul stomp of ""Let Me Through"", or the violent mood swings of ""Open Up"", which upends its desolate opening verse with a riff straight off an early Rush record. And given her commitment to staying in character, it’s doubly strange how, in the album’s dying minutes, the Dead Weather completely abandon their monochromatic schematic. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Dodge and Burn</i> is capped by the ill-fitting ""Impossible Winner"", a sensitive piano ballad that’s practically <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"">Oasis</a>-like in its orchestral ascent (and which, in light of the equally stately ""The Last Goodbye"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15288-blood-pressures/""><span>the last Kills record</span></a>, prods Mosshart further toward her destiny as a torch-song chanteuse). It’d be one thing if there was anything else on this record—or in the band’s entire discography, for that matter—that showed the Dead Weather had any interest in opening up their airtight rock-noir aesthetic. But tacked onto the end of another dependably dank Dead Weather record, the song feels less like a graceful break-of-dawn denouement than the musical equivalent of being awakened in the middle of the night by a flashlight to the face.</p></div>"|21035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21035-dodge-and-burn/|7.3|Stuart Berman

<p>The overarching themes of Peaches' work—gender identity and expression, queer sex, leftist politics—are now more than ever at the forefront of our culture, which means her lyrics sound less transgressive than they might have even five years ago: ""Can't talk right now/ This chick's dick is in my mouth"" she deadpans on the album's title track. But Peaches has always been able to use her outré, sometimes downright silly, personality to shed light on real issues, like society's patriarchal disgust at the natural state of a woman's body. In the same song, when she sets up a scene of ""circle jerk girls who spray/ we've got a male in the middle and we bukkake"", she may be the only female pop musician working today who sings about sex while firmly and intentionally diverting the objectifying male gaze. While it may not always be pretty or elegant, it's damn necessary, and <i>Rub</i> does an excellent job of it.</p>
<p>But is Peaches' music secondary to her politics? Interestingly, the first voice you hear on <i>Rub</i> isn't Peaches', but the distinctive whisper-moan of Kim Gordon. On album opener ""Close Up"", Gordon purrs for Peaches to get closer to the camera as she raps/speaks about her sexual exploits (the song's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rnJAe3zuzQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> features Gordon coaching Peaches through a shit-smearing wrestling match). The track's catchy, powerful bass drum beat threads throughout <i>Rub</i>, which benefits from a driving dance element, much like a sonic sequel to 2009's electro-heavy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13003-i-feel-cream/""><i>I Feel Cream</i></a>. <i>R</i><span><i>ub</i> is the first album in her career where the music feels as foregrounded as Peaches' persona, which makes sense, as she co-produced it with Vice Cooler.</span></p>
<p>Rub's centerpiece is ""Free Drink Ticket"", an altogether strange offering that doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the album. With her voice downpitched to sound more masculine, Peaches delivers an almost stream-of-consciousness diatribe against a pretentious club promoter. It sounds jarringly personal, and lyrically is strikingly different from every other track. It's a misstep that is corrected by ""Dumb Fuck"", the closest thing <i>Rub</i> has to a straightforward pop song (even though it contains about 35 F-bombs). With it's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"">Robyn</a>-esque disco synths and biting lyrics, ""Dumb Fuck"" is a call for feminists everywhere to ditch their boyfriends for Roland MC-505s.</p>
<p>""I Mean Something"", the album's closer and duet with fellow Canadian/frequent collaborator/ex-roommate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"">Feist</a>, sees Peaches defiantly state <i>Rub</i>'s most telling line: ""No matter how old, how young, how sick/ I mean something."" Is that a hint of desperation? Aggression? Bravado? Perhaps, realistically, a mixture of all three, both an assertion of Peaches' rightful place in the trenches of the culture wars and an artistic plea for attention.</p></div>"|20950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20950-rub/|7.0|Cameron Cook

They ground the blurry, bizarre visions established on their previous efforts, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19650-wand-ganglion-reef/""><i>Ganglion Reef</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20338-golem/""><i>Golem</i></a>, in colorful imagery, so that the faces of the monsters they’ve written about on past records come into full focus.</p>
<p>While the shadow of Wand’s mentor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a> still hovers over Wand’s blown-out garage sound, the band’s own flickering light is beginning to shine through more often. They have added some progressive folk rock to the mix, fondly recalling unique and memorable records like Mellow Candle’s <i>Swaddling Songs</i> and Comus’ classic <i>First Utterance</i> without sounding like a carbon copy. Cory Hanson’s voice shimmers  against the acoustic palette of songs like the beautiful closer ""Morning Rainbow"", the song that also contains <i>1000 Days’ </i>key lyrical thesis: ""We will see this world together in its terror.""</p>
<p>Paralysis, paranoia, disappearance, erasure, pure fear, and curdling dreams are all themes that reappear in Hanson’s lyrics for <i>1000 Days</i>; even the titular song, a concise bit of folky garage pop with a sunny-sweet choral melody, seems like it might be a love song at first but quickly turns into the nightmare of relationship stasis, depression, and ennui (""I don’t need a thing ‘cause I’ve had every dream""). The mingling of beautiful, honeyed melodies with dark, bleak lyrical content is nothing new, but Wand do it especially well, and they have a precision in their songwriting that keeps their music from spinning off into glazed burnout territory.</p>
<p>Though one worries that with such a prolific release schedule that Wand will run out of ideas, <i>1000 Days</i> is a heartening record, a record that sees a young band picking up steam, playing with their influences more deftly than on their prior LPs, and bringing a thoughtful approach to old and well-traveled sounds. There’s enough interesting moments on <i>1000 Days</i> to hold onto these songs, go back to them, and explore within them. That’s more than many of their cohorts within the cluttered and long-trendy field of psychedelic garage—there are hundreds of disposable tape-label bands with little to say out there, and it’s wearying to search through all that crud for the occasional gem, which does exist—have to offer.</p></div>"|20995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20995-1000-days/|7.0|Jes Skolnik

In short, you have to want it, or more accurately, <i>feel</i> it—and Ron Morelli both wants it, and feels it. Morelli is chiefly known as boss of the New York-born, Paris-based techno imprint <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/l-i-e-s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L.I.E.S.</a>, but<i> A</i> <i>Gathering Together</i> is his fourth release for <a href=""http://hospitalproductions.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hospital Productions</a>, the label run by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"">Prurient</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30495-vatican-shadow/"">Vatican Shadow</a> man Dominick Fernow. In Fernow, you sense Morelli has found a true bedfellow, one who shares his aesthetic of misanthropy, gutter eroticism, and sonic abrasion.</p>
<p>L.I.E.S.’ take on techno is brackish and lo-fi, and Morelli’s 2013 debut for Hospital, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18780-ron-morelli-spit/""><i>Spit</i></a>, conformed to type: in broad terms, this was a club record, albeit one with torn clothing and dried blood under its fingernails. <i>A Gathering Together</i> is something more uncategorizable and disassembled. There are occasional hallmarks of dance music—a whoosh of sub-bass here, a vandalized vocal line there—but there will be, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"">Bill Callahan</a> might have it, no dancing. Rhythms recall mechanical or industrial processes, pitched too fast or too slow for physical interaction. ""Desert Ocean"" is a hobbled march of throbbing generator tones and bold horn-like blasts that sound like a tanker lost in thick fog. The sounds of ""New Dialect"" bring to mind a needle puncturing metal, underwater scrapes, and the hiss of compressed gas. ""Voices Rise"" takes a brief vocal sample and suspends it in limbo with a variety of tics, scratches, and twists, while the miasmic drone of ""Cross Waters"" sounds like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivr57dcs9-E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Guy Called Gerald’s ""Voodoo Ray""</a>, on fire, being lowered into tar.</p>
<p>This oppositional quality leads you to reflect on Morelli’s personal philosophy. ""People are terrible and always have been,"" he told FACT in an <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2013/11/28/im-just-disgusted-by-humanity-l-i-e-s-boss-ron-morelli-talks-spit-clubs-and-itunes/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> two years ago, while the accompanying text for <i>A Gathering Together</i> describes the title track as being born from ""rapid-paced dead-end urban environments that force people together."" Perhaps the record’s most vivid, evocative cut, it begins with a disorienting field recording, before we hear what sounds like massed ranks of hands taking up percussion instruments and proceeding to beat out increasingly furious polyrhythms. The message seems plain enough—humanity can be horrifying—but there’s a paradoxical quality to its sense of barely corralled frenzy. If there is fear and disgust here, there is also elation and fascination, too—a recognition of life, even if it feels not so much empathetic as anthropological.</p>
<p>Is <i>A Gathering Together</i> a noise record, or not? The mechanistic looping and layering of ""The Story of Those Gone"" suggests Morelli might be familiar with the output of demented industrial recluses such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Bianchi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maurizio Bianchi</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrax_Morgue"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atrax Morgue</a>. Equally, however, he might not, these being the sort of sounds you might discover given solitude and the right—that is, wrong—mental state. To Morelli’s credit, <i>Gathering</i> feels detailed and textured where it needs to, its shifting layers crisp and detached rather than blitzed into mulch. But Morelli’s negative energy, when robbed of an unrelenting bass drum, can drift toward monotony.</p>
<p>The idea that techno is more developed, or evolved, than noise is, of course, a false dichotomy. But take Dominick Fernow: his path from Prurient to Vatican Shadow has felt like a progression, opening up his compositional practice in a way that’s informed his many other projects to date. It’s hard to shake the feeling that Morelli, as he drifts from the dance floor, is taking a reverse path, somehow. Consequently,<i> A Gathering Together</i> is a bold move that falls short of being a landmark. But as an illustration of where Morelli might angle his music and label next—not to mention his readiness to confuse, confound, or destroy in order to explore more personal themes or private fancies—it still illuminates.</p></div>"|21068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21068-a-gathering-together/|6.5|Louis Pattison

Her new group of songs, <i>Unremembered</i>, is more restrained than <i>Penelope</i>, but no less haunting.</p>
<p>Like <i>Penelope</i>, <i>Unremembered</i> features Shara Worden of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4828-my-brightest-diamond/"">My Brightest Diamond</a> on vocals. This time, <a href=""http://asthmatickitty.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Asthmatic Kitty</a> vet DM Stith and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/935-clogs/"">Clogs</a>’ Padma Newsome join her, while the ensemble is a collection of all-star new music players from ICE and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5003-so-percussion/"">So Percussion</a>. Its vague stories are set in shadowy old houses, endless meadows, sinister thickets and forests lost souls enter to never emerge from. Snider’s multiple narrators spiral deep into dark memories of these places. The libretto comes from the poet Nathaniel Bellows, who takes his formal cues from 20th century imagists like Emily Dickinson and William Wordsworth, describing gothic New England vistas.</p>
<p>The foreboding and chaotic tenor of the music mirrors the fear and horror of the characters: Ghosts are ever-present, evoked by the constant surges of soupy, heavily reverbed background vocals that rise and fall behind each song’s primary narrator—either Worden, Stith, or both. Often, these anonymous voices assume a role in the story: In the pastoral ""The Song"", they are echoing bird calls, but on the more macabre ""The Estate"", they become taunting spirits (""The field has breath, the pond a voice...They told me then to leave this place/ Or stay and lose it all""). Eventually, they become buried underneath Snider’s mournful, kinetic instrumental figures (glissandi-punctuated violin lines, chimes, harp, or Snider’s own celeste), which sometimes recall the work of Snider’s former teacher, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27568-david-lang/"">David Lang</a>, and at more tuneful moments, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3641-max-richter/"">Max Richter</a>. Most songs build to booming climaxes, that dissipate along with the ""vapor of the dead"" at the end of each song.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The record is best when Snider’s music captures both the beauty and foreboding of Bellows’ setting at once; in restrained pieces like ""The Orchard"" and ""The Past"", she lets subversive dissonance creep slowly into her simple accompaniments. Many of Bellows' poems feature images of mirroring, water, and hazy vantages of landscapes or spirits, and Snider’s musical landscape complements this with a rippling, echoing quality. Her melodic shapes are as vague as the scenes she is describing: It is intelligent and evocative, but it takes a focused listen, and is best enjoyed with Bellows’ words on hand for reference. His poetry interacts closely with the musical pivots. <i>Unremembered</i> definitely lacks the haute tension and the fierce musical contrasts of <i>Penelope</i>, but there are plenty of pleasurably uncanny moments. Even in these more contemplative scenarios, Snider still keeps visceral emotion on the surface of her music.</p></div>"|20854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20854-unremembered/|7.5|Winston Cook-Wilson

Fortunately, the hard work and meticulous fine-tuning of <i>Every Open Eye</i> is so deeply embedded in the finished product that Chvrches never come off as self-conscious. Instead, it manifests as that uncanny, priceless quality of the truly popular: confidence.</p>
<p>Chvrches toured <i>The Bones of What You Believe</i> exhaustively, so they don't have to overthink what things ""everyone"" liked about them and which parts were scare-quotes deep, dark, and thoughtful. You’ll be really let down if you hoped Chvrches would build on the proggier excursions of ""Science/Visions"" or if you believed Doherty’s expansive, nearly-six minute closer ""You Caught the Light"" justified a bigger role. Otherwise, the band rightfully assume that their unabashed embrace of pop's ruthless economy got them playing festivals in front of thousands of pop fans.</p>
<p>So, when Lauren Mayberry belts, ""we will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold,"" it can be read as the band's artistic edict rather than one of the examples of her occasional slip into Millennial Successorizing (""I am chasing the skyline more than you ever will""). Nearly every moment of <i>Every Open Eye</i> is filled with aspiration and there's not a false step or bum note, verses and pre-choruses and choruses in brutal competition to be called ""the hook."" Mayberry summed it up as ""emo with synths in it"" in a <a href=""http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-andy-greenwald-podcast-lauren-mayberry-of-chvrches-on-the-bands-new-album/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent podcast </a>while expounding on a teenage love of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2195-jimmy-eat-world/"">Jimmy Eat World</a>, and you can suss out a structural similarity between <i>Every Open Eye</i> and <i>Bleed American</i> (five radio-friendly bangers, ballad, four more radio-friendly bangers, slow-dance closer). Even the obvious deep cuts have a functional purpose<span>—""</span>Afterglow"" is a slight comedown that still feels necessary as exit music after nearly 40 minutes of constant peaks, while Doherty's light-stepping, funk-pop inclusion ""High Enough to Carry You Over"" is an allowable indulgence for a band that truly prides itself on being a <i>band</i>, rather than Mayberry and Those Other Guys.</p>
<p>There's also an irrepressible buoyancy and reassurance, even if it's not just in her head where Mayberry feels looked down on. Her detailing of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60974-chvrches-lauren-mayberry-discusses-internet-trolls-on-channel-4/"">brutal rape threats</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52483-chvrches-lauren-mayberry-writes-editorial-against-online-sexism/"">casual misogyny</a> she faces as a female public figure are both shocking and sadly familiar; she's more cagey about the personal relationships that serve as the lyrical muse for much of <i>Every Open Eye</i>. Though Mayberry's background in law and journalism served as an early footnote in the Chvrches come-up, she draws on that as much as any musical thread here. Whether asking for reconciliation (""Clearest Blue"", ""Empty Threat"") or demanding closure (""Never Ending Circles"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17583-chvrches-leave-a-trace/"">""Leave a Trace""</a>), Mayberry is judge, jury, and executioner, making convincing, carefully worded closing arguments set to casually devastate.</p>
<p>With nearly all of mainstream pop's biggest acts <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2015/09/the_weeknd_carly_rae_jepsen_taylor_swift_why_the_sound_of_the_1980s_became.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">looking toward the '80s</a> for inspiration, <i>Every Open Eye</i> might be even <i>more</i> of-the-moment than its predecessor—Mayberry’s extracurriculars cast her lyrics in a feminist lens à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6272-cyndi-lauper/"">Cyndi Lauper</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a>, while the arena-ready hooks justify the comparisons to pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11881-speak-spell-music-for-the-masses-violator/""><i>Violator</i></a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"">Depeche Mode</a> (the synth riff from ""Clearest Blue"" can't get enough of ""Just Can't Get Enough"") and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"">Pet Shop Boys</a>. But minus the occasionally violent imagery of ""Gun"" and ""By the Throat"", Chvrches lack any of the qualities that made the aforementioned feel subversive or rebellious. This can actually work in their favor—""Leave a Trace"" was memorably described by Mayberry as a ""middle finger mic-drop,"" but her words are neatly manicured and polite enough to painlessly decapitate rather than bludgeon or incinerate. You can't have peak efficiency without formulas, though, and by the time ""Playing Dead"" and ""Bury It"" threaten to get mixed up on title alone, the similarly beaming melodies and diffident references to bones, crossed lines, and oceans start to render heartbreak, joy, resilience, and exhaustion interchangeable.</p>
<p>The minor flaws of <i>Every Open Eye</i> are much more acceptable in light of the hedge-betting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20306-another-eternity/"">sophomore</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21034-caracal"">efforts</a> from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"">Purity Ring</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a>, perhaps the two acts who've been more imitated over the past two years than Chvrches. They've moved past their earliest days when their competition was assumed to be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"">Passion Pit</a> or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife"">the Knife</a>, but in leveling up, they actually seem more conservative sonically, lyrically, and visually than the pure pop acts for whom they're used as a foil, i.e., <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift"">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna"">Rihanna</a>... hell, maybe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61331-chvrches-cover-justin-biebers-what-do-you-mean"">Justin Bieber</a>?

His father—""Big Joe,"" a former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay Z</a> bodyguard—appears on the intro track, ""I'm the King"", praising his son's mixtape efforts and ability to balance school with his artistic ambitions. He closes out one of his monologues encouragingly stating, ""Watch him work,"" and then Veggies hops in on his verse: ""A lot on mind, and I try not to show/ Yeah, that's part of life, you live and you grow/ She suckin' me slow."" The lines, among many others on <i>Live &amp; Grow</i>, don't exactly broadcast personal progress, and the presence of Veggies' father only exaggerates the near-comical contrast between the title's stated thesis and the nature of the album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still only 22 years old, Veggies' career stretches back to high school when he founded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"">Odd Future</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"">Tyler, the Creator</a> (who appears on and produced ""R.I.P.""). He's since moved on from OF, released five solo mixtapes, and launched the <a href=""https://www.peasncaratsintl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peas &amp; Carrots International</a> clothing line. His biography alone demonstrates that Veggies has, in fact, lived and grown. Throughout the album, however, he often shies away from specific details, rendering the title more of a distraction than a mission statement. ""New Face$"", for example, is about Veggies' journey to fame—a road that inevitably includes many hiccups and fake friends—but he reveals very little about the trip. He offers possible insight (""New foreign chick and she famous/ She cashed me out and we dated""), but quickly abandons the thought in favor of played-out tough talk.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Veggies' vague lyrics are mirrored in the production, which flips between styles like a major label rap album of 10 years ago might. Tyler, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31412-iamsu/"">Iamsu!</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31181-hit-boy/"">Hit-Boy</a>, Top Dawg collaborator <a href=""https://twitter.com/producedbythc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">THC</a>, and more contribute work, and there are genuine pop moments (<a href=""https://youtu.be/uSEvpgohpfU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tied Up""</a>, <a href=""https://youtu.be/PN-ydYSorgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wonderful""</a>) alongside somber smooth cuts (""Sincerely Casey"", ""I'm Blessed""). There are even two takes on California's mainstream sounds: hi-hat-slappin' Northern California hyphy (<a href=""https://youtu.be/CgLgAisFrmc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Backflip""</a>) and bassier L.A. post-g-funk (""Actin' Up""). It's a capable roster, but <i>Live &amp; Grow</i> is more of a platter than a platform, and Veggies never gets to settle into a sound he can develop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He is at his best on the more California cuts. ""Backflip"", for instance, is an instant earworm. Nonetheless he is still upstaged by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"">YG</a>, who delivers a more vulgar, memorable verse than Veggies by actually addressing the song's female subject. Veggies just speaks <i>for</i> her, and doesn't seem to see her as anything other than an object of his own success. This self-interest, instead of self-examination, comes through further on ""Wonderful"" and ""Tied Up"". On those tracks, as on many others, the respective hooks and verses don't relate very much at all. Flat lines like, ""I spend every day like it's my birthday,"" fail to tell us about his lifestyle or to even communicate a mood. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Without any real lyrical flourishes to make his character interesting, the listener is left with Veggies' work at face value. He relies too heavily on end rhymes, doesn't vary his flow often enough, puns too obviously, and regularly leans on cliches. The lack of variation makes more sincere moments, like ""Aw Man"", difficult to wade through, as well. The song should be the center of his <i>bildungsroman</i>, but when each line is delivered with a near-identical cadence, hashtag lines sound as important as confessionals, minimizing the song's gravity. It's melodic and quite catchy at times, but <i>Live &amp; Grow</i> is less than the sum of those parts. The album's title isn't misleading as much as it is as trite as the music it contains.</p></div>"|20893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20893-live-grow/|5.7|Matthew Strauss

Between the screamy guy, the yelpy guy, the nervous guy who sang as if sweating through his pocket protector, and the open invitation for anybody else in the band to pipe in whenever they felt it might lend an extra energy to a song, it was a love-it-or-dismiss-it affair, even by the standards of an emo revival that favors messy, overstuffed statements. The eight-piece band may have filtered their updated emo through the sensibilities of some of the most broadly popular indie rock of the '00s, but they were fundamentally a niche act.</p>
<p>On their sophomore album <i>Harmlessness</i>, they become less of one. In an effort to smooth out their rough edges after some lineup changes, TWIABP start with the roughest of them all: those voices. The screamy guy is gone, and the singer who emerges as the de facto pack leader, David Bello, has ironed most of the jitters out of his delivery. Those more approachable vocals set the tone for a record that's more orderly than its predecessor but no less sweeping. These songs still build, crash, weep, and rejoice, often all within the span of a few minutes, and the band still has no interest in moderation. If anything, <i>Harmlessness</i> actually has <i>more</i> going on than <i>Whenever, If Ever</i>, but it’s all done more tastefully, and the album’s warm, open production makes it easier to take in just how sophisticated these arrangements are—without all those voices crowded on top of each other, for instance, you can hear every violin stroke. TWIABP have succeeded where past generations of emo bands have often stumbled: tidying up their sound without losing any of the exuberance and immediacy that made that sound so striking in the first place.</p>
<p>TWIABP tuck their most audacious song toward the front of the record. Condensing a subject loaded enough for a full concept album into five-and-a-half minutes, ""January 10th, 2014"" tells of <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2409741/Diana-hunter-kills-Ciudad-Juarez-bus-drivers-revenge-sexual-assaults-women.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Diana, the Hunter of Bus Drivers</a>, the anonymous avenger from Juárez, Mexico, who shot and killed two factory bus drivers in retaliation for the rampant, unprosecuted sexual assaults committed by drivers on late-night routes. She became a folk hero, honored with statues in two cities. The song lifts some lyrics directly from a <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/diana-hunter-of-bus-drivers/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This American Life""</a> episode about her myth, including an exchange that’s acted out between Bello and singer/keyboardist Katie Shanholtzer-Dvorak. He voices a driver weary of a passenger who might be Diana; she speaks as every woman relieved to finally have some power over potential predators. ""Are you afraid of me now?"" she sings. ""Well yeah,"" he responds, ""Shouldn’t I be?""</p>
<p>The moment is so on-the-nose, so borderline musical theater, that it’s bound to make some listeners wince, but even those put off by it have got to admire the band’s temerity. Though <i>Harmlessness</i>’s primary fascinations lie with familiar subjects—overcoming depression, navigating changing relationships, finding a place in the world—the band detours from that safe territory to confront listeners with an uncomfortable moral quandary about whether taking a life is ever justified. The song sympathizes with Diana’s crusade while acknowledging the gruesome irony of celebrating a murderer.</p>
<p>Of course, <i>Harmlessness</i> does the safer subjects well, too. One of Bello’s many songs about wrestling himself from depression’s grip, ""Rage Against the Dying of the Light"" builds to a hooky alt-rock riff, then pivots right into the album’s celebratory highlight, ""Ra Patera Dance"", which channels the grizzled cheer of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5363-good-news-for-people-who-love-bad-news/"">Good News</a></i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a>. <i>Harmlessness</i> is loaded with these kinds of seamless transitions, and the band’s smart sequencing keeps the record moving with brisk efficiency. ""Haircuts for Everybody"" takes just a minute and a half to build to its brutally pretty climax.</p>
<p>Where TWIABP’s last album ended with an epic seven-minute closing statement, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bns8VScN5Wg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Getting Sodas""</a>, <i>Harmlessness</i> doubles down with two of them (actually, two and a half, if you count the lovely little hidden track tacked on to the end of ""Mount Hum""). Stacking so many moments of grandiosity on top of each other should be overkill, but it isn’t; each suite pays off triumphantly. With <i>Harmlessness</i>, the World Is a Beautiful Place have accomplished a rare feat: a lofty, loaded album with the grace and momentum of a far leaner one.</p></div>"|21037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21037-harmlessness/|7.9|Evan Rytlewski

He also has something a lot of precocious upstarts don't: a deep and evolving catalog, counting 15 singles and now three albums to his name. His latest, <i>Blurse</i>—out on Lucy's excellent <a href=""http://stroboscopicartefacts.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stroboscopic Artefacts</a> label—is a bold, confident step away from the dance floor material he's been honing and into deep, abstracted structures and pristine sound design.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Blurse</i> opens the way a lot of techno records do—with a grimy, compressed kick drum—and that's about the last time <i>Blurse</i> proceeds the way a lot of techno records do. The second kick arrives nearly a second later, an eternity on a dance floor. By the 90-second mark Chevel seems to have lost interest in the kick drum entirely, taking a mid-track siesta with the swirling harmonics and buzzing synths/insects. The drums come back—they almost always do—but these kind of aberrant structures define <i>Blurse</i>, which sees Chevel continually chart his way to abstraction and back again.</p>
<p><i>Blurse</i>, then, is kin to a certain strand of hypnotic, percussion-heavy dance music that sits at the edges of house and techno, the kind only touched by adventurous and skilled DJs. There are elements of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/"">Pearson Sound</a>'s coptering drums, of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31078-objekt/"">Objekt</a>'s cryptic architecture, even of the spacey suspensions of early dubstep masters such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22116-loefah/"">Loefah</a>. And, impressively, Chevel never veers too far into the avant-garde; <i>Blurse</i>, with its hard gray surfaces and dubby quivers, is always identifiable as techno in some mutated form. Chevel is walking a tightrope here, maintaining structure while unmooring most of a track's conventional building blocks.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's fun to be had in the details, too. The end of ""Watery Drumming"" features wildly rippling echoes as what sounds like an actual clock keeps time. ""Down and Out"" consists mostly of short, pitched percussion sounds and little stabs of an electric piano; skipping around the track with your mouse you're as likely to find utter silence as anything. The gorgeous ""Loop #33"" sees gooey, molten synths rise from beneath the cracks in the percussion.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Concrete melodies are a little thin on the ground, so <i>Blurse</i> can sound homogenous. The record sometimes lacks the dynamism of works by the aforementioned artists, at times bordering on ascetic and clinical. But this style, which results in a lot of short, compact tracks, lends itself well to the album format. Which might be the point: Chevel has released two EPs and a 10-inch this year, all of them showcasing his steady progression but aimed more squarely at the dance floor. <i>Blurse</i> has the precision of a practiced producer and mischievousness of a rogue. It's the result of a young producer not just making techno but taking it apart, rearranging it, breaking it.</p></div>"|21129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21129-blurse/|7.7|Andrew Gaerig

It's the biggest look of Anderson’s career so far by a million miles, one that seemingly came from a chance encounter with the iconic producer. <a href=""http://massappeal.com/straight-outta-oxnard-anderson-paak-talks-working-with-dr-dre-on-compton/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">According to Mass Appeal</a>, Anderson attended a studio session when his recent song, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/stonesthrow/nxworries-anderson-paak-knxwledge-suede"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Suede""</a>, caught Dre’s attention. ""He comes in, and I’m just sitting in the room, and I saw him play it over and over again,"" Anderson told the publication. ""At the third time, he was ready to work.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Until now, though, the California singer/producer had achieved marginal success: Following his 2012 debut under the name Breezy Lovejoy, Anderson’s follow-up—<i>Venice</i>—showed his promise as a storyteller, but the album was largely undercooked and whizzed by without much impact. Anderson has released a few singles and projects <a href=""https://breezylovejoy.bandcamp.com/album/lovejoy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>on Bandcamp</span></a>, and he’s the vocal half of NxWorries with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32885-knxwledge/"">Knxwledge</a>, a prolific composer who landed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO-ZsW0orlk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>this great beat</span></a> on <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/"">To Pimp a Butterfly</a></i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>The Anderson .Paak EP</i> is the artist’s first release since <i>Venice</i>, and it's appearance is timely. Running just four tracks and less than 20 minutes, <i>The Anderson .Paak EP</i> is a quick listen, but it demonstrates Anderson’s talent and charisma. His raspy inflection evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29167-bilal/"">Bilal</a>’s sensuous tenor and the lyrics explore mostly light fare—blowing weed, the highs of personal freedom (""Drifter II""), the captivating first moments of new love (""Make it Work"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even when he discusses serious topics, like on the two-part ""Cheap Whiskey.70’s Reisling"", Anderson does so in the smoothest way possible. ""Wish I had a chance to write ya,"" he croons, presumably talking about an absent father figure. ""I wish I didn’t look just like ya.""

Their pristine syntheses of UK garage, Midwestern vocal house, and hook-happy pop structures re-oriented the British pop charts and trickled into the American ones, opening the doors for pop-adjacent neo-house acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30666-duke-dumont/"">Duke Dumont</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33029-years-years/"">Years &amp; Years</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31420-rudimental/"">Rudimental</a> (not to mention for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"">Sam Smith</a>). Disclosure have never really been the types to throw curveballs: they do what they do, and they do it impeccably. But it’s understandable they’d start feeling restless, especially as the scope of their influence rendered their own tunes increasingly indistinct. ""That sound is everywhere now,"" Guy, now 24, admitted in an <i>L.A. Times</i> <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-ca-ms-disclosure-20150712-story.html#page=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">profile</a> this summer. ""The same old bass lines, the same old samples. We’re a bit bored by it.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Scrubbed of much of its predecessor's overt 2-step and house homage, <i>Caracal</i> suggests the duo's also grown bored of the conversation that's surrounded them from the start: how dance and pop music can and ""should"" relate. On one hand, here were two young men making wide-reaching dance tracks that weren’t reliant on drops, builds, or any of festival EDM’s creatine-crazed trappings. These guys scanned as ""tasteful,"" for better or worse. But on the flip side were classicists and underground dance fans who pegged the duo as milquetoast gentrifiers of scenes they were too young to fully appreciate, repackaging history with the context and kinks ironed out. There is some sting in the charge, but it's not entirely fair: Disclosure’s work has always made the most sense within the framework of pop, in terms of both form and demographic. In that sense, calling Disclosure contrived or formulaic misunderstands how pop works. Their music may be one-size-fits-all, but it’s also immaculately crafted and catchy as fuck, smudging the divide between the universal and the personal to the point where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14188-latch-ft-sam-smith/"">""Latch""</a> somehow seemed to grow more poignant the more ubiquitous it became.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Those dance classicists will likely be less territorial with </span><i>Caracal</i><span>: the brothers have dialed down the BPMs significantly and turned toward slow-burning, R&amp;B-inspired grooves. </span><span>But as they’ve edged away from giddy neo-nostalgia toward a sound with less identifiable anchor points, they’ve begun to blend into the background. On ""Omen"", the brothers reunite with Sam Smith for a single presumably meant to reprise the massive success of ""Latch"". And it’s fine—plodding along at a stately downtempo strut with a hint of a 2-step hitch, Smith’s voice a bit mired in that familiar elastic bassline. But it’s nowhere near as immediate, or as gripping; here, when Smith sings of missed opportunities for emotional connection, ""Latch""’s obsessive </span><i>I-will-never-leave-your-side-god-dammit</i><span> conviction feels like a distant memory. Much of </span><i>Caracal</i><span> is vaguely pleasant music you can put on in the background while you’re working—but is that really what we look to Disclosure for?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Meanwhile, where <i>Settle </i>set the tone for years of pop hits to come, <i>Caracal</i> seems content to fall back amidst the pack. Opening track ""Nocturnal"" is a showcase for R&amp;B’s man-of-the-moment <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>, and it wouldn’t sound out of place on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20999-beauty-behind-the-madness/""><i>Beauty Behind the Madness</i></a>. Its synth arpeggios seem to aim for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24089-frankie-knuckles/"">Frankie Knuckles</a> and Jamie Principles’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOLE1YE_oFQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Your Love""</a>, but the vibe is closer to late-'00s Hype Machine dance tracks (halfway through, the track practically breaks into its own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31080-classixx/"">Classixx</a> remix). This makes sense, in a way: much of the Billboard pop and R&amp;B charts over the last year have embraced this sound, from Nick Jonas’ ""Jealous"" to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32982-jason-derulo/"">Jason Derulo</a> to the current bumper crop of vaguely Balearic ""tropical house"" <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltncvWS-vIw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">singles</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7y3G_iZHEo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remixes</a>. But for Disclosure, the move feels like a step backward, an aim at broader relevance that’s only watered down what once made them feel thrilling.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are bright spots: lead single ""Holding On"" retains their signature bounce and features stunning vocals from jazz songwriter Gregory Porter, and ""Good Intentions"", with its understated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a> appearance, is the best example of their smoothed-out new direction, keeping a brisk pace but leaving more open space. Still, it’s getting harder to shake the sense that these redemptive guest spots have become a crutch for a lack of ideas. Both of the album’s two featureless tracks feel instantly forgettable—particularly ""Jaded"", a beige wash of cheeseball lyrics that chastise a dishonest companion with all the depth of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdtKbq3Omkw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Why You Lyin"" Vine.</a></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When Disclosure’s hype was at its peak circa <i>Settle</i>, they were often compared to turn-of-the-century acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/300-basement-jaxx/"">Basement Jaxx</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>—acts who successfully recontextualized older house and disco influences into something reverent and contemporary. But a significant part of both groups’ appeal—and, crucially, part of the outright critical revulsion at the time, too—was their lack of self-seriousness, their willingness to get a little cheesy. Those guys’ nostalgia embraced the kitsch along with the classicism; they <i>had fun</i>. The Lawrence brothers have good taste, sharp instincts, and pristine craftsmanship: playfulness, not so much. Even the album’s most unbuttoned track falls flat: ""Bang That"", a (relatively) raunchy promotional single now relegated to the bonus tracks with a gratuitous sample of 313 Bass Mechanics’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3ThwiUhfE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Pass Out""</span></a>, feels a bit cringey, like Kidz Bop does ghetto house. Ultimately, <i>Caracal</i> just doesn’t feel much fun, and even its highs are nowhere near <i>Settle</i>’s polished bliss. Once trendsetters, here the Lawrence brothers too often fade noncommittally into white noise.</p></div>"|21034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21034-caracal/|6.6|Meaghan Garvey

It is, in other words, a pure product of the Internet—</span>a robust, cross-platform, thinkpiece-generating app that testifies mostly to Adams' ability to get attention. You have to hand it to him for knowing what he's doing: His album choice churns up some nice, irony-rich soil for culture and music critics to wriggle around in. Even though Taylor Swift has been a songwriter first and foremost throughout her career, <i>1989</i> was where she collaborated more intensely with superstar producers like Max Martin and Shellback to help her cross over from<span id=""docs-internal-guid-9fe05728-fffa-07a6-d99f-193943a85da0""><span> Queen of Pop Country to the center of the pop world proper. The move worked spectacularly: <i>1989</i> is among the best-selling albums of the post-Napster era. And now Ryan Adams has transformed it again, into... a run-of-the-mill Ryan Adams album.</span></span></p>
<p>It's an odd object to engage with. Adams is entertaining, always has been, and he's carved out what is by now a fascinating career, filled with a few widely beloved heartland rock albums and a great many weird one-offs that have won him a devoted cult. <i>1989</i> is on the one hand an example of the latter, but it's presented in the style of the former. He throws himself into the album completely—the arrangements are fully realized and he sings with care and precision, revealing his admiration. But he also reveals some fairly crucial points about how good songs are put together. </p>
<p>Every recorded song is the end point of a long road with many possible forks in it—a series of small decisions about chord changes, melody lines, lyrics, and arrangements. Swift's <i>1989</i> songs are written for a specific kind of production—the melodies are clipped, percussive, and designed to hit with force at very specific times. They are written to be electro-pop songs, which rely more on big dynamic changes and repeating cells of melody. </p>
<p>At its best, Swift's <i>1989</i> crackles with life, and highlights what it feels like to be young and looking at the world from a very specific moment; Adams transforms those feelings into a wistful and generic feeling of weariness. To put it in the context of an artist to whom Adams is often compared, <i>1989</i> shows why <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Springsteen</a> went synth-pop on <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i> in 1984—the songs demanded it. The songs that sound like anthems were <i>meant</i> to be anthems; Springsteen's stark demos of the songs are instructive but they weren't the finished product. Remember, too, that he tried to turn his dark folk masterpiece <i>Nebraska</i> into a full band album but realized it needed to come out as an acoustic demo. Which is to say that ""Out of the Woods"" is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=129kuDCQtHs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dancing in the Dark""</a>, not <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3eu1gW-bQ8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Atlantic City""</a>.</p>
<p>Swift knows this about her own material, and the demos of <i>1989</i>'s songs she included on the album show how dramatic the transformation can be. In Adams' hands, they are flat, flavorless rockers, and when the music isn't simply boring it crosses the line into actively grating. He wants ""Blank Space"" to be a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>-style heartfelt ballad, but the melody feels thin, rushed, and monochrome in this setting. He delivers ""Shake It Off"" in a grim and determined tone that would be appropriate if he were singing about how conservative politics have decimated rural families at the inaugural Farm Aid—but when paired with a repeated refrain of “haters gonna hate,"" it sounds ridiculous. And Adams' ""Style"" is downright garish, coming off like Bono fronting Survivor, the dark side of the album's titular year.</p>
<p>Adams' <i>1989</i>, for all its sincerity and technical execution, is ultimately hollow because it's nothing but context. There's everything surrounding it (the unexpected match of singer and song, the details of the release) and there's what you bring to it (your relationship to the music of Swift and Adams, your demographic profile, your feelings on rock and pop and covers in general) but there's no essential reason for it to exist. This is why <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30204-father-john-misty/"">Father John Misty</a>'s rush-released version of ""Blank Space"", wherein he remade Swift's song in the style of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a>, was such a brilliant example of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/910-the-masterful-mockery-of-father-john-mistys-1989-jibes/"">recorded song as music criticism</a>. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-9fe05728-0005-630b-cce6-1d254adc45b3""><span>His track was a hilarious (and, importantly, still musically enjoyable) reminder that Adams' entire album is a gesture. It's a formal exercise. You listen and think, ""Ah, I see what he did there"" and then you forget about it.</span></span></p></div>"|21101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21101-1989/|4.0|Mark Richardson

After a dormant period at home among Japan’s vinyl geek underground, the 1983 record began to spread farther in 2008, when the tastemaking Scottish DJ duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3215-optimo/"">Optimo</a> shared a cut online. That song, ""Shinzo no Tobira"", which they first heard in a Tokyo record store, has since earned a cult following worldwide for the ethereal lines it traces between Asian and Middle Eastern tonalities, folklorish Armenian lyrics, and futuristic Japanese synthpop leads. Its soundscapes are like those once dreamt by Brians <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Wilson</a>.

It's almost as though <i>Utakata</i>—now reissued by <a href=""http://paltoflats.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Palto Flats</a>—has at last arrived on our shores not simply through a crate digger’s time warp, but from some other world altogether.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Or maybe a few of them: As befits an album that owes its broader discovery to a Shinjuku record store called Eurasia, <i>Utakata</i>’s plainspoken lyrics are sung in alternating Armenian and Japanese. In this regard—and most others—the record bears no resemblance to Mariah’s previous five, wherein a revolving door of popular Tokyo session men dabbled in everything from prog rock to jazz funk. By 1983, the project was being led by Yasuaki Shimizu, a relentlessly exploratory musician best known for the saxophone takes on Bach’s Cello Suites he would later record in both Japanese mines and Italian palazzos. His brilliant solo outing from the previous year, <i>Kakashi</i>, is <i>Utakata</i>’s only obvious relative. But that earlier work’s East-meets-West patchwork of genres, moods, and scales feels much more cut and dry than the seamless marvel Shimizu would soon create. Given how difficult it remains to find a fair comparison for any of <i>Utakata</i>’s seven songs, let alone synthesize the picture they form together, it’s an album that has well earned its reputation as an elusive classic.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The long tally of pleasant surprises begins with opener ""Sokokara…"" (""From Here…""), in which slash-and-burn no wave guitar and a frantically overloaded player piano somehow only add to the springtime optimism suggested by the song’s marching beat, blossoming synths, and Shimizu’s skyward warble. ""Hana Ga Saitara"" (""Were Flowers to Bloom"") is a more eloquent draft of the dubbed out, sax-led post-punk that was then beginning to bubble up in England rock clubs, here powered by brass skronk and proto-techno synths. And ""Fujiyu Na Nezumi"" takes the British nursery rhyme ""Three Blind Mice"" and translates it into Japanese, Armenian, and a poetic syntax of spare bass, sustained synths, and simple percussion—indicating not so much the album’s sense of humor as the childlike wonder animating its every move. Mixer and engineer Seigen Ono would later work the boards for artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"">John Zorn</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2490-arto-lindsay/"">Arto Lindsay</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2297-king-crimson/"">King Crimson</a>, but the way he focuses Shimizu’s playtime ruckus of international instrumentation and production techniques remains the accomplishment of his career.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Utakata</i>’s most impressive feat of synthesis, however, lies in its coupling of East Asian and Middle Eastern sounds. The most explicit instance occurs in early highlight ""Shisen"" (""A Vision""), which weds gorgeous piano pentatonics and koto court music with Armenian vocalist Julie Fowell’s mesmerizing mantra, ""Our eyes as one."" When the lone, cavernous drum and piercing sine waves enter, the effect is devastating. The twinning effect is at its subtle best on the famously DJ-friendly ""Shinzo no Tobira"" (""My Life Is Big"") that first got Optimo’s attention, where unforgettable melody walks the fine line it all but invents between its authors’ musical heritages.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In 2015, it remains a rare and enchanting thing to hear a piece of convergence culture this effortless—which, after all, may be one reason </span><i>Utakata</i><span> still sounds so otherworldly. Another could be the fact that the album owes its existence to a creative moment in Japanese pop that remains virtually unknown to the English-speaking world. Thanks to '80s electronic pioneers Yellow Magic Orchestra’s continued chart success and the glory days of the Japanese economy, the mainstream entered a renaissance of open-mindedness and ludicrous recording budgets, producing an abundance of records that answer Shimizu’s sonic adventures with ones every bit as bold and compelling. Maybe </span><i>Utakata</i><span> belongs, then, not to some wondrous alternate history, but a real one we’re just beginning to uncover.</span></p></div>"|21030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21030-utakata-no-hibi/|8.5|Jakob Dorof

The Underachievers, his duo with Issa Gold, practice the kind of esoteric mysticism that once flourished in some far-flung corners of '90s rap, from the feverish jabberwocky of Leaders of the New School’s <i>T.I.M.E.: The Inner Mind’s Eye</i> to the pan-African zealotry of X-Clan’s <i>To the East, Blackwards</i>, and the backpacker bohemianism of Zion I’s <i>Mind Over Matter</i>, Mystik Journeymen’s <i>The Black Sands Ov Eternia </i>and Abstract Tribe Unique’s <i>Mood Pieces</i>. It’s an ethos that largely dissipated by the end of that decade as rap moved on. But the Underachievers have not only revived it, they’ve stuck with their spiritual bent through four projects, including 2013’s revelatory <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17716-indigoism/""><i>Indigoism</i></a>, last year’s uneven but satisfying <i>Cellar Door: Terminus Ut Exordium</i>, and now <i>Evermore: The Art of Duality</i>.</p>
<p>At first, <i>Evermore </i>appears to offer more of the same, as they rap about being miseducated in school, dabbling in street hustles, and feeling alienated from society. ""We lost in this world, but it’s hard to relate,"" says AK on ""Chasing Faith"". They strive to use their experiences to educate others through hip-hop music, celebrating the use of ""natural"" herbs such as marijuana and ‘shrooms, but acknowledging that they’ve struggled with harder substances. They underline the importance of their metaphysical lessons by acknowledging in ""The Dualist"" that ""We all sin.""</p>
<p>AK and Issa Gold complement each other. Vocally, AK has a more sour tone and a barking delivery that sounds like he’s dispensing real talk. Issa Gold has a mid-range baritone that lightens when he gets excited, as if he can’t wait to finish rapping one line and start the next. Both are strong lyricists, but for much of <i>Evermore</i>, they repeat the same themes again and again. The perils of mental illness are frequently noted; mainstream religious dogma, school indoctrination, and the banality of social media and Western pop culture are repetitively disparaged.</p>
<p>These observations are delivered over serene production. ""Shine All Gold"" matches an acoustic guitar loop to a bass drum bounce, then closes with an ambient techno beat. The next two tracks, ""Chasing Faith"" and ""Star Signs"", pick up that downtempo thread and build backgrounds full of melancholy and yearning. ""The Dualist"" breaks the holistic spell with the kind of mid-'90s boom-bap classicism on which the Underachievers and other Beast Coast artists built their reputation. The warm electric keyboards and synthesizers of ""The Brooklyn Way"" make for a particularly glorious peak. ""Hands up if you live for love,"" chants Issa Gold.</p>
<p>For much of <i>Evermore</i>, the Underachievers spin in their spiritual axis, until a series of tracks near the end break the heavenly trance with jarring abruptness. Trap orchestration creeps in on ""Take Your Place"" as Issa Gold warns, ""Don’t fuck with the snakes,"" and AK adds, ""Really pop up on a nigga blocka/ If he think he hotta ‘cause a nigga conscious/ Got to keep a chopper just to cease the nonsense."" The duo descends into a hellish inferno until they reach the ninth circle of ""Allusions"". ""Got a bitch in the Bay that loves the ‘shrooms/ She be screamin’ AK when I shove the broom,"" brags AK. Issa Gold adds, ""Smoking fuego with your dame/ Been like a whole 20 minutes, can’t front, nigga still don’t know her name /30 minutes later, had my pinky in her brain/ She like, I thought you was different, all of you rappers just the same/ She ain’t complain.""</p>
<p>The latter songs throw everything that precedes it into doubt. Are the Underachievers just rap dudes lusting for weed, bitches, and cash like everyone else? They’re obviously aware of the contradictions, but <i>Evermore: The Art of Duality</i> places these adventures in a present-tense context. Perhaps they’re simply acknowledging their flawed humanity. Just as likely, they don’t yet realize that their perspectives on sex and violence can be as tough to break as the mental prisons that damaged their troubled youth.</p>
<p>The <i>Evermore</i> journey is an engaging one, but it would have slid into a new age torpor if not for the spate of ugliness near the album’s end. The coarse ""Generation Z"" shenanigans give the earlier ""Chasing Faith"" added urgency. We now know why the Underachievers strain to ascend their earthly selves. ""I done came far, still got a lot further to go,"" raps Issa Gold on the final track, ""Unconscious Monsters (Evermore Outro)"". ""Trying to leave a mark by giving everything that I know.""</p></div>"|20998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20998-evermore-the-art-of-duality/|7.5|Mosi Reeves

And somehow Juicy J is forty but he seems particularly ageless—there’s <i>When the Smoke Clears</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4388-three-6-mafia/"">Three 6 Mafia</a>, there’s Juicy J accepting an Oscar and appearing on his own show on MTV, then there’s 2011 Juicy J, attached to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a>’s Taylor Gang troupe, rapping with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16912-somethin-bout-kreay/"">Kreayshawn</a>, spawning catchphrases (""you say no to drugs—Juicy J can’t!""), and releasing free music at a furious clip, keeping up with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>'s of the world and rappers half his age.</p>
<p>Juicy J didn’t <i>have</i> to come back, but he did, and his career reached a logical conclusion with his third solo record, 2013’s <i>Stay Trippy</i>, which was surprisingly great then, and holds up now. At the time, it wasn’t hard to see some cynicism in Juicy J’s late-career moves—he appeared to be angling for the blog-space that spent so much time covering guys who directly bit his original style (somewhere <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29688-spaceghostpurrp/"">SpaceGhostPurrp</a> is sighing). But Juicy J is from blue-collar Memphis, all he does is work.</p>
<p>On the heels of the largely forgettable <i>Blue Dream &amp; Lean 2</i>, <i>100% Juice</i> drops all pretense and opens with the clearest mission statement possible: ""There’s too much stupid-ass shit happening right now, it’s time to turn up."" From there, it’s business as usual: dense, booming dark beats, hooks that mostly consist of a phrase shouted like a salutation, cataloging of various drugs taken and sexual escapades, then an occasional guest to break it up.</p>
<p>While Juicy J’s re-emergence came on the heels of Lex Luger, Mike WiLL, and Young Chop beats, now he’s playing in a contemporary field consisting of 808 Mafia, Sonny Digital, and Metro Boomin. Juicy J’s greatest asset has been his ability to make his surroundings his own. The same way he ran through those 2011 Lex Luger beats, he slides right into the spacey, trap-noir of 808 Mafia—""Still"" runs a piano loop sounding straight out of <i>Halloween</i> as Juicy J sticks the landing on a vivid line like ""she got my wife-beater on as a nightgown"" and the punchline ""you just looking for a quick come-up, I can feel it in the air like Phil Collins."" How Juicy J rattles off these lines, in a way not unlike the now-infamous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a> triplet flow, but with an ascending and descending cadence that emphasizes the <i>right</i> syllables, is indicative of how effortless this comes to him. He never sounds tired, never phones it in. He’s the consummate pro.</p>
<p>Juicy J is funnier than most rappers and capable of getting the most ludicrous hooks stuck in your head (""I drop them beans in my lean"" will haunt you for days) and he’s the rare rapper who commands respect from the people around him. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32643-boosie-badazz/"">Boosie</a>’s vicious, borderline-disgusting verse on the ""Film"" remix is impossible to not run back a dozen times, demonstrating the intensity with which artists approach a Juicy J feature. Same goes for Lil Herb, who pops on ""Ain’t No Rapper""; the change of scenery breathes new, vibrant life into the Chicago emcee’s scratchy, traditional gangster tropes. <i>100% Juice</i>, while not a revelation, is sturdy and solid. A great artist <i>can </i>endlessly remake the same sounds and make it work, and the self-contained good time of <i>100% Juice</i> adds a few new wrinkles.</p></div>"|21076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21076-100-juice/|7.1|Matthew Ramirez

An odds-and-ends compilation with no coherent vision, the tape finds Thug rapping at a high level, but performing less consistently as a songwriter. It's not clear he even wants to be a songwriter on all these records; one gets the impression the tape's been compiled ex post facto, a few fully-fleshed out classics mixed in with studio dross. Some feel more like workouts, perhaps cut quickly during marathon recording sessions. (Initially </span><i>Slime Season</i><span> was to be produced entirely by London on da Track. ""Ask 300"", the beatmaker </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/LondonOnDaTrack/status/644282892873392128"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>tweeted</span></a><span>—a reference to Thug's label—when questioned about the more diverse production lineup of the final tracklist.) The bulk of these songs are for Thug completists, or those convinced of his infallibility. Nevertheless, Thug remains one of hip-hop's most exciting stylists, consistent even amid inconsistency, and there are moments worth savoring.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Part of the problem is that Thug's catalog has already been flooded with leaks and unofficial releases. Some of them—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17542-young-thug-hey-i/""><span>""Hey I""</span></a> is a particular standout—are superior to many of the records here. Thug's biggest fans would be better off compiling their own greatest hits from the pile, and Thug neophytes will find this year's <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20529-young-thug-barter-6/""><i>Barter 6</i></a> or last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19901-birdman-young-thug-rich-homie-quan-tha-tour-part-1/""><i>Rich Gang</i></a> tape a much more consistent entryway. It's unclear why certain records made the cut and others didn't. The inclusion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Wayne</a> feature ""Take Kare"" (which has been out since last year) may be yet another pointed dig at Thug's idol (the two have since had a falling out), but it was also an anticlimax. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-75788b7f-fc3e-df01-8ae9-4fa79909f9ec""><span>""Power"", produced by London on da Track, seems like something left on the cutting room floor from the </span><i>Barter</i><span> sessions, and if it was, it's easy to hear why: where each </span><i>Barter </i><span>record made up a discrete facet of the album's sound, ""Power"" sounds a little bit like three of them at once</span><span>—</span><span>consummate filler. </span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In the rush to fete Thug for his radical talents, <span id=""docs-internal-guid-75788b7f-fc3f-5f6d-74e8-ae6eab276d75""><span>it's important to draw distinctions between what records work, and which ones do not</span></span>—or those which <i>sort of</i> work, if you look at them from the right angle. Part of the joy of his art is that you can draw together your own version of his canon from a scattered field, picking up on the pieces that most attract you. (This is not a quality limited to Thug; it's been this way since the Internet began to reward rappers, like Lil Wayne and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"">Gucci Mane</a>, who could flood the market without drowning in it.) The most evident gem here is ""Best Friend"". Its hook is inspired by a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbT51WD71Fk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>viral vine</span></a> (Tokyo Vanity, the meme's creator, has released a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bta4NZKQku0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Best Friend""</span></a> record of her own), and its surreal video is sly and artfully unpredictable. The Ricky Racks-produced record, which builds upon disorienting sound effects and hypnotic pizzicato strings, draws you in while bringing you no closer to figuring it all out, a contradiction at the heart of the Young Thug project.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Thug's best songs are carefully structured, even if they appear effortlessly thrown together, and the most effective moments tend to be subtle, sidling up to the listener. Each of the song's parts—melodies, backgrounds, hooks, choruses, and flows—lock in to give the song a shape as particular as a fingerprint. Many songs on</span><i> Slime Season</i><span> don't chase this goal; at the album's opening,</span> Thug's <span id=""docs-internal-guid-75788b7f-fc40-4571-090e-7a45d76a2386""><span>drawn to repetitive, headbanging patterns</span></span> and the results are for hardcore fans only. The opening tracks, the Sonny Digital-produced trap banger ""Quarterback"" and the Southside-produced ""Rarri"", are interesting but lack replay value. A<span id=""docs-internal-guid-75788b7f-fc40-f5ff-4eae-3989e444838e""><span> few of the harder-edged songs do work: </span></span>""Freaky"" might be its best experimental moment, with Wondagurl's unstructured, percussive beat bringing Thug's songcraft and improvisational rap style to the fore.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But the album's true highlights don't arrive until its close, with the one-two punch of ""Draw Down"" and ""Wood Would"". On the former—which has been out for some time—Thug  strategically deploys different flows to shape the song, while his unpredictable figurative language keep the listener on their toes: ""Pull up with that K out of the coupe! I like my bitch brown like a mu'fuckin' boot!"" he says at one moment, or later: ""Put that pussy on my head like a fuckin' Motrin!"" Disguised in his squall of a delivery, </span>they're not conveyed as jab-you-in-the-ribs punchlines; they're playful and impossible to anticipate, chasing novelty rather than cliche, lending the song an uncertain, volatile air.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-75788b7f-fa29-6491-e514-f471e82d93b3""><span>As for ""Wood Would"", it's the album's strongest, and stands among the best in his catalog. With its sample skipping like a stone as its drums slam in place, it's low-key and unassuming, evading direct translation and shifting in and out of lucidity. Yet Thug wears his heart on his sleeve through one of pop's oldest tools: an undeniable melody. It says everything he doesn't need to, as if everything you didn't know were clear as day.</span></span></p></div>"|21099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21099-slime-season/|7.6|David Drake

Harris. Since 2001, the Atlanta rap icon has been churning out hits—be they of the ""mixtape street classic"" or ""mainstream feat. <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Rihanna</a>"" variety—and thanks to those hits, he has resisted a slow fade into obscurity. In fact, he has packed his dance card to the gills, what with his recent appearance in Marvel's <i>Ant-Man </i>and the usual busywork that a globe-trotting, ""Blurred Lines"" appearing, Iggy Azalea co-signing (and then disowning) Grand Hustle label head has to slog through. While his hardcore fans remain supportive (did you know that T.I. has never had an album that didn't sell at least 250,000 copies?) it wouldn't really shock anyone if he decided to phone it in as an artist by now.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In recent interviews though, Harris is adamant on returning to his old ways and <i>Da' Nic</i>, the new five-song EP meant as a warm-up for the forthcoming <i>Dime Trap</i>, showcases this shift effortlessly. <i>Trap</i> will be the first album Harris will record under his original TIP nickname, which he eschewed for T.I. way back when in order to avoid confusion with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"">Q-Tip</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6195-a-tribe-called-quest/"">A Tribe Called Quest</a>. As a release, <i>Da' Nic</i> isn't going to pacify any longing you might have for *Trap-A-Holics voice* REAL TRAP SHIT, but it's a strong record from one of the better rappers we have these days and a breath of fresh air from a guy who was treading the path of ""reality show dad"" just a few years back. If the last few T.I. releases have sounded complicated and unnecessarily heavy, <i>Da' Nic</i> sounds like the guy most of us met on 2003's <i>Trap Muzik</i> finally heading back to his old neighborhood to sit on the porch and talk some shit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like many others, T.I. has occasionally fallen beneath the weight of the Major Label Rolodex. (Just because you <i>can</i> put Usher or Chris Brown on a song doesn't mean you <i>should</i>, dig?) On <i>Da' Nic</i> there's only one feature: The London on Da Track-produced toe-tapper ""Peanut Butter and Jelly"", which features guest verses from ""Young"" rappers both new (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Thug</a>) and old (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10852-young-dro/"">Dro</a>).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>More than anything, this record sounds like the work of a seasoned veteran who's annoyed that everyone isn't giving him his dues as a good rapper. Even on his most bloated releases—2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10397-ti-vs-tip/""><i>T.I. vs. T.I.P</i></a> being the best example—count on T.I. for at least one moment where he showcases his ability to ramp up his verses when he even <i>senses</i> that people are sleeping on him. On <i>Da' Nic</i>, that moment is ""Ain't Gonna See It Coming""  (""No, I'm not that old nigga think that he run it/ And talkin' bout what he did back in the day/ I'm just as vicious as ever, I'm brilliant and clever and still 'bout that action today""). It's refreshing to hear him serve notice.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Let's be honest: While the EP is a welcome return to form, it's still five songs. You aren't going to find hidden treasure here. However, for those who have said they want the old T.I. back—the Lil' Flip- and Shawty Lo-obliterating King of the South who spit acid when he wasn't making the girls dance, all while wearing a Braves fitted cocked on his head at an angle that doesn't make any logical sense—<i>Da' Nic</i> promises some hope for his upcoming <i>The Dime Trap.</i></span></p></div>"|21075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21075-da-nic-ep/|6.9|Ernest Wilkins

For most of the last decade, Argote's band has existed as a Jekyll/Hyde operation, oscillating between thrashing noise rock and hushed folk. Depending on her lineup, a Des Ark show might find her making a mockery of ear plugs, contorting her body into impossible positions to force the cruelest sounds from her instrument, or playing for a crowd seated on the floor, inviting them to squeeze in closer in order to hear her over her unplugged guitar.<br/> <br/> Argote makes either extreme feel like her natural state on stage, though capturing both on the same record has proved more of a challenge. 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15418-dont-rock-the-boat-sink-the-fucker/"">Don't Rock the Boat, Sink the Fucker</a></i> positioned scorching punk uncomfortably against pretty but sometimes overworked songs that lost some of the intensity of Argote's solo performances. On <i>Everything Dies</i>, she avoids that whiplash. Though it was recorded in bits and pieces at six studios in five states over a span of several years, with a range of collaborators including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9500-thor-harris/"">Thor Harris</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1346-engine-down/"">Engine Down</a>'s Jonathan Fuller, and Saddle Creek journeyman <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/9932-andy-lemaster/"">Andy LeMaster</a>, it coheres like the product of a single session. <br/> <br/> No track benefits more from this unified approach than ""Ties"". Argote has been kicking that song around since at least 2007, when it first appeared under the misleadingly silly title ""Covert Conspiracy of Spanish Speaking Cats"" on <a href=""http://desark.org/wxduv2lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a solo session</a> Argote recorded for the Durham station WXDU. On its <i>Everything Dies</i>' update, she's accompanied by imposing guitars and drums that give the song thrust, underscoring Argote's violent imagery without drowning out the dread in her voice. It's the most devastating song she's ever written, a chilling documentation of the tolls of loving an addict—the promises they might break, the things they might steal, and the bruises they might leave. ""Here it is,"" she sings, ""The bathtub where you'll find the love of your life, choking up his own blood."" The words seem to fight her as they leave her mouth.<br/> <br/> Not all of <i>Everything Dies</i> is so bleak—it couldn't be. ""French Fries Are Magical"" plays like a prolonged hug, as does the album's most unabashedly pretty number, ""Street Woods"". And the one song on the record that does live up to its irreverent title, ""Don Taco &amp; His Hot Sauce Toss"", is downright gleeful, a communal rejoice that falls somewhere between <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3361-the-polyphonic-spree/"">the Polyphonic Spree</a>'s rainbow sing-alongs and the radiant pop of <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"">Feist</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10178-the-reminder/"">The Reminder</a></i>.<br/> <br/> As on <i>Don't Rock the Boat</i>, there are moments on <i>Everything Dies</i> where you can't help but wonder how a songwriter this good has existed so far below the radar of so many listeners. In a recent interview with <a href=""http://www.afterellen.com/people/451115-des-ark-writes-songs-women-queer-people"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">After Ellen</a>, Argote shed some light on why that might be, explaining that she prefers to play queer-friendly venues and safe spaces removed from the threats and harassment that women face at traditional venues. ""I don't really feel like I need to cultivate a male audience,"" she explained. ""My songs are written for women and they're written for queer people; those are the people I've been closest to in my life, who I obviously want to share my music with … Really what I would like to do is create spaces that are safe for everybody and since I identify as queer I think it helps.""<br/> <br/> Those comments sparked some distracting backlash from male commenters somehow upset that a woman might want to target her music at her own community, but they reveal a lot about these songs. For all the turmoil it confronts, <i>Everything Dies</i> really does create that sense of safety. Nearly every song extends a hand to the abused, the subjugated, or the otherwise marginalized and reassures them they'll be all right. ""I'll bandage up your arms, your legs, and leave you where the wounded lay,"" she offers a lover on ""Coney Island Street Meat"". Argote cycles through nearly every emotion imaginable in these songs, but the one that drives her the most is concern.</p></div>"|21009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21009-everything-dies/|7.5|Evan Rytlewski

From <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13931-causers-of-this/""><i>Causers of This</i></a> on, each Toro Y Moi release has been a subtle shakeup: 2011’s stellar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15129-underneath-the-pine/""><i>Underneath the Pine</i></a> laser-cut the corners of chillwave down to a fine point; 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17516-anything-in-return/""><i>Anything in Return</i></a> turned his songwriterly impulses into disco and pop gems; and, most recently, he channeled early experiments with garage and indie rock into this past April’s <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20385-what-for/""><i>What For?</i></a> But each project somehow sounds distinctly like Toro Y Moi, bound by Bundick’s unflagging production chops. The latest Toro Y Moi project, <i>Samantha</i>, is a free mixtape that piles together recordings from as far back as 2012 and as recent as last month. It serves as a neat way of tracking Bundick’s progression as a musician while prominently highlighting his talent for both beat-driven and atmospheric production. </p>
<p><i>Samantha</i> is filled with unexpected turns. Sparse one- and two-minute instrumental sketches serve as interludes, creating a sense of flow with soul and R&amp;B samples (""Stoned at the MoMA"", ""Prayer Hands"", the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"">Ciara</a>-quoting ""Boo Boo Mobile""). Bundick ventures into ambient on glitchy, sedate closer ""welp, tour’s over"" and ""ambient Rainbow"", with the latter layering choral vocals and soothing washes of sound to mesmerizing ends. It’s a testament to Bundick’s innovation that he’s still finding ways to contort his signature sound into new shapes. Even when songs do call back to his previous work, as on ""Us 2"", which pairs a churning hip-hop beat with sugary synth pads that sound lifted from his 2011 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAyB7rGyS2w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> of Cherrelle’s ""Saturday Love"", they still put a fresh spin on the approach.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Samantha</i> are about the ups and downs of relationships, placing most emphasis on the downs. Bundick even goes so far as to tack an extended sample of <i>The Notebook</i> onto the end of creeping, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"">Washed Out</a>-assisted ""Want"", a move that very narrowly evades tipping over into schmaltz. On the trap-influenced ""The Usual"", he laments the frustrations of being a workaholic in a relationship, an unusually frank moment from Bundick. Elsewhere, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30151-kool-ad/"">Kool A.D.</a> spins off into woozy, emotionally conflicted verses (""I got problems acting like a fuckin’ grown up,"" he grouses in Auto-Tune on ""Real Love""), while rising Atlanta rapper Rome Fortune relays relationship fallouts on two of the tape’s best tracks, <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17578-toro-y-moi-pitch-black-ft-rome-fortune/"">""Pitch Black""</a> and Puff Daddy-sampling ""Benjiminz"". <i>Samantha</i> lightens up by the end, as on the sweetly jittery ""Enough of You"", but the main theme seems to be that relationships are complicated messes that can lead to comfort and love as easily as pain and heartbreak.</p>
<p>That <i>Samantha</i> comes in the wake of the guitar-driven <i>What For?</i> makes the mixtape particularly welcome, like a palette cleanser to prepare us for wherever Bundick goes next. Even if he's purging his hard drive of one-offs that didn’t fit anywhere else, with a free-form structure, winning collabs, and appealingly nocturnal ambience, <i>Samantha</i> is a welcome addition to Bundick’s catalog.</p></div>"|21059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21059-samantha/|7.5|Eric Torres

Since their relatively conventional-sounding art-pop debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12922-jewellery/"">Jewellery</a>, </i>the band has pushed their experimentation further every new release, from crafting homemade instruments to recording live arrangements alongside orchestras. And now, just a year after releasing her harrowing avant-garde <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19239-mica-levi-under-the-skin-ost/"">score for the film </a><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19239-mica-levi-under-the-skin-ost/"">Under the Skin</a>, </i>Mica Levi has returned to her band to release <i>Good Sad Happy Bad</i>.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the aftermath of composing a soundtrack for a major motion picture, Levi wanted to bring simplicity back to Micachu, as <i>Good Sad Happy Bad</i> toys with a warped minimalism that feels new even for this band. The record counteracts the fuzzy, almost punk rock energy of their last album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16849-never/"">Never</a>,</i> settling for soft, acoustic guitar and childlike keyboard arrangements. Even the production of the record is spare and unedited, with warbled vocals and frequent inclusions of studio chatter on songs like ""Dreaming"" and ""Crushed"".</p>
<p>The record feels intimate and casual in this unrefined state, but the line between relaxed and lazy is shaky on <i>Good Sad Happy Bad</i>. When all the tinker-toy elements align, it works beautifully, as on ""L.A. Poison"" with Levi singing softly about the loneliness of urban life over mechanically looped strumming guitar and a simple kick-drum. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17569-micachu-oh-baby/"">""Oh Baby""</a> sounds like a murky, blues-leaning lullaby, as if its keyboards are being played underwater while Levi croons above them. But the off-key, off-tempo energy of tracks like ""Hazes"" and ""Relaxing"" feel thrown together and messy, even if it was purposeful. </p>
<p>The biggest shift here is to be found in Mica Levi’s voice, which is strained and echoed as she sings wearily about bad feelings. You can barely understand her at times, but <i>Good Sad Happy Bad</i> is fundamentally a gloomy self-help record, with its assurances delivered realistically. ""It’s gonna be okay,"" Levi repeats in a chipper, sing-song voice at the end of ""Sad"". On ""Thinking It"" Raisa Khan relays how she wants to get better at working out and being healthier so she can enjoy her old age. On ""Sea Air"", all Levi wants to do is breathe in the ocean air because ""all that crap means nothing to [her].""</p>
<p>Although <i>Good Sad Happy Bad</i> is certainly the band’s least polished-sounding record, the combination of the scattered arrangements and Levi’s ruminations on sadness shrewdly underline the topsy-turvy feeling suggested by the title. Even with the band’s music messily chopped, looped, and jangled, the emotional messages always ring clear. ""It’s only suffering,"" Levi sings on ""Suffering"", her voice suddenly lilting the phrase as the song gains tighter, harder percussion and guitar as the song nears its end. ""That keeps my conscious clean.""</p></div>"|21069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21069-good-sad-happy-bad/|6.9|Hazel Cills

History suggests they are nearly twice as likely to produce a resounding dud as a working piece of art, and yet the prospect never ceases to excite us. When rumors began to swirl weeks ago that Drake and Future might be releasing a joint project, the Internet went into a frenzy. <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/""><i>Watch the Throne </i></a>parallels were drawn, fake cover art circulated, and a website countdown appeared as if to wish it into existence.</p>
<p><i>What a Time to Be Alive </i>materialized on Sunday<i>, </i>and the mixed results won't surprise anyone who has already noted the decided lack of chemistry between these two. There's been a Drake feature on every Future album, but none of them are particularly riveting, and on <i>What a Time </i>it's clearer than ever that they have difficulty sharing the same space. Many tracks<i> </i>are just Future songs with Drake verses tagged on (Future gets almost double the airtime), and Drake often sounds out of his element. When Future gets rolling on songs like ""Digital Dash"" and ""Live From the Gutter"", Drake is a bystander. The tape was allegedly born out of an impromptu, six-day recording session, and too many moments on it <i>feel</i> like they were thrown together in that time span. Drake probably shouldn’t be on a song called ""I’m the Plug"", for example, and the hook on ""Big Rings"" is terribly bland and awkward. This wasn't created with the care or the dutiful curation we've come to expect from both artists when solo.</p>
<p>But that spontaneity is kind of the point of <i>What a Time to Be Alive</i>. Unlike <i>Watch the Throne</i>, which was presented as a grand statement album from self-coronated heads of rap royalty, <i>What a Time</i> is a tag-on release, a one-off that intentionally exists in the shadows of its 2015 predecessors as a bonus disc. <b></b>Designating it a tape seemingly alleviates the pressure to curate. Meanwhile, Drake’s cushy Apple deal allows him to disseminate it for retail via iTunes and premiere it exclusively on his OVO Sound show on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio. It’s a low risk, high reward proposition.</p>
<p>Both artists offer slightly watered-down versions of themselves: Drake offers snarky responses to his recent ghostwriting allegations (""I might take Quentin to Follies,"" ""The pen is working if you niggas need some ghostlines,"" etc.) and Future mentions internal struggles (""When you say you love a nigga do you really mean it?/ When I was sleepin' on the floor you shoulda seen how they treat me/ I pour the Actavis and pop pills so I can fight the demons,"" ""I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average""). It’s an odd juxtaposition, especially with Drake returning to the stiff, pinched ""<i>yes, I wrote these, can’t you tell?</i>"" style of his circa-2010 hashtag rap bars, with some truly dire results (""<span>You remind me of a quarterback/ That shit is all in the past"", from ""Digital Dash"", needed a vigorous ""no"" from someone in the room). </span></p>
<p>Even with Drake’s lazy punchlines, though, both he and Future are still great rap artists in their primes, and sometimes they figure things out just based on sheer talent. What the tape lacks in congruence, it makes up for in glimmering Metro Boomin production, and Drake throws Future the perfect alley-oop on ""Scholarship"" over his muffled synths. ""Jumpman"" is a certifiable banger. ""Diamonds Dancing"" is the first great Drake-Future collab that clicks on all cylinders. Of course, the brightest moments for both rappers come at the end of <i>WATTBA</i> when they are each allowed to work on their own and make music in their respective comfort zones—first Future on ""Jersey"", then Drake on the 40-produced ""30 for 30 Freestyle"", which showcases some of his best rapping in recent memory. It’s a disjointed but fitting end for a working relationship that’s still a work in progress.</p></div>"|21102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21102-what-a-time-to-be-alive/|7.0|Sheldon Pearce

She tells her about the bad dream she just had, in which her father emailed her a digital folder containing nude images of Remy taken when she was a child. But the really weird thing about it was—as Remy notes with a combination of embarrassment and pride—""I was </span><span>kinda hot stuff</span><span>. I mean, I don't know, I looked </span><span>good</span><span>—so it was kind of confusing."" What follows is a brief conversation about the peculiar relationship dynamic between fathers and daughters compared to moms and sons—Remy's friend concludes that if she had been born a boy, she'd be ""one of those sons that turns into a fascist dictator,"" while Remy retorts, ""instead of just another woman with no self-esteem."" Her sardonic punchline is punctuated by a burst of canned sitcom laughter—and, much like </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXq2rsaOxWQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>that infamous Rodney Dangerfield scene in </span><i>Natural Born Killers</i></a><span>, the device elicits more squirms than chuckles.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But on <i>Half Free</i>, that bizarre exchange counts as comic relief. And even though this interlude—titled ""Telephone Play No. 1""—appears just six minutes into the record, it's still a necessary respite. By that point, we've already heard from the unhappily married wife of a man who had previously bedded her two sisters (""Sororal Feelings""), and a widow grieving her soldier husband's death over a riotous reggae groove (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17436-us-girls-damn-that-valley/"">""Damn That Valley""</a>). And there are several more tales of women with no self-esteem to come—unflinching portraits of ladies reeling from inattentive, cheating, or absentee lovers. So the seemingly random appearance of ""Telephone Play No. 1"" actually makes more sense as the album plays out. It's simply a verbal manifestation of what Remy's proper songs do musically: take us into the spaces that are supposed to provide us with solace—home, family, relationships—and make them feel awkward and uncomfortable. (As the dejected narrator of ""Sororal Feelings"" declares through a deceptively sunny harmony: ""Now I'm going to hang myself/ Hang myself from my family tree."")  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Likewise, Remy's music has always thrived on the conflict between the familiar and foreign. On previous U.S. Girls releases, her pop and experimental sensibilities—part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6809-the-shangri-las/"">Shangri-Las</a>, part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"">Sun Ra</a>—were often at war with one another. (Take 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16064-us-girls-on-kraak/""><i>U.S. Girls on KRAAK</i></a>, where the Ronettes-style romp ""State House (It's a Man's World)"" gets rudely elbowed into the free-form subterranean skronk of ""Sinkhole"", as if two opposing spirits were fighting for control of Remy's soul.) But, by building upon the grotto-bound R&amp;B introduced on 2013's <a href=""https://badactorsinc.bandcamp.com/album/free-advice-column"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Free Advice Column</i> EP</a> (whose hip-hop-schooled producer, Onakabazien, returns here), <i>Half Free</i> further fortifies the common ground between Remy's diamond-cut melodies and avant-garde urges. The album sounds like your favourite golden-oldies station beamed through a pirate-radio frequency, seamlessly fusing '60s-vintage girl-group serenades and smooth '70s disco into dubby panoramas and horror-movie atmospherics.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But even as its backdrop mutates from deep-house throbs to psych-rock guitar solos,</span><i> Half Free</i><span> always focuses your attention to where it should be: on Remy's radiant voice and vivid storytelling. She's the sort of songwriter who can set a 3D scene in a single line that simmers with suggestion—the first words we hear on the record are ""Well there were a four of us in a real small space/ Sharing more than just a family name,"" and you can immediately feel all the humidity and unease hanging in the room. The cinematically scaled production on </span><i>Half Free</i><span> only intensifies the domestic dramas playing out within her lyrics: the steady, string-swept build of disco reverie ""Window Shades"" mirrors the emotional breakthrough of its protagonist, a woman scorned who finally summons the courage to confront her philandering partner; the drizzling, slow-percolating beat of ""Red Comes in Many Shades"" provides the gray-skied ambience for Remy's tale of a doomed affair with an older paramour, all while her ""tears fall like rain."" And though ""Sed Knife""—an upbeat power-pop revision of a 2012 B-side—may seem like an outlier here, its images of kitchen-table tensions fit right into the album's theme.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-325d726f-e20c-e8d2-08b8-ff9c067f6d18""><span>The women at the center of these songs are indeed half free: they're prisoners to bad choices, cruel circumstances, and duplicitous men—but they're starting to take control of their situation. And with the epic closer ""Woman's Work"", Remy leaves them with a neon-tinted, mirror-ball-twirling anthem to herald their impending liberation. ""You arrived in your mother's arms/ But you will leave riding in a black limousine,"" Remy seethes at a departing ex who's off to live the high life—or the afterlife—without her, but the defiance in her voice suggests she's richer for it. ""A woman's work is never done/ She doesn't sleep 'til the morning comes,"" chimes the Greek chorus behind her—and when applied to a creatively restless, audacious voice like Remy, it sounds less like a complaint than a promise.</span></span></p></div>"|20978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20978-half-free/|8.0|Stuart Berman

After that track, Martin and Robinson joined forces as King Midas Sound and followed with the 2009 full-length <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13616-waiting-for-you/""><i>Waiting for You</i></a>. Their latest project is a series of four EPs collaborating with an outside artist, beginning with this release with Austrian guitarist-composer Christian Fennesz.</p>
<p>Those familiar with Martin’s brand of concussive dub and Fennesz’s elegant dance between electronic glitches and dulcet guitar washes might be taken aback by the hushed tones of this pairing. There’s very little of Martin’s telltale drum programming, while Fennesz’s singular guitar tone is hard to parse amid the hash of gray static that envelops almost everything here. Kiki Hitomi, who previously lent her voice to both the Bug and a KMS remix, does her best Beth Gibbons impersonation on the melancholic trip hop of ""On My Mind"", but its one of the few tracks with a discernible pulse. Robinson whispers a line about ""hold[ing] each other tight"" but everything about his voice on the record suggests the phantasmal, a now-departed ex-lover who returns only in a dream. When he slurs about searching for safe ground on the eerie ""Lighthouse"" it seems to have been recorded from inside an abandoned one.</p>
<p><i>Edition 1</i> mimics the depression and subsequent grind and quiet desolation of a breakup so precisely that it's hard to take in all at once. And while the effect of such distant vocals works early on in the album, by the back half, it just sounds like every vocal was recorded over a poor cell phone connection, tinny and small. Robinson details the depression of a breakup in maddeningly mundane detail, muttering about going through the days in a ""weed fog""; subliminal rhythms fade in and out but the expected bass surge never arrives. The album fully comes to life only on the haunting 14-minute instrumental ""Above Water"".</p>
<p>The dark melodic guitar elements on the record sound like Fennesz, but very little else is instantly traceable to him. Much of his discography involves collaboration with distinct artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O’Rourke</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3902-sparklehorse/"">Sparklehorse</a>, but what’s remarkable here is how Fennesz dissolves into the bleak landscape, his signature sound rendered indistinct, a loss of identity that mirrors the album's main theme.</p></div>"|21014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21014-edition-1/|6.7|Andy Beta

In 1994, Atlantic released Jawbox's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13732-for-your-own-special-sweetheart/""><i>For Your Own Special Sweetheart</i></a> and that same year Epic issued <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3776-shudder-to-think/"">Shudder to Think</a>'s <i>Pony Express Record</i>. Both groups had made their names on Dischord, and ""selling out"" was a fraught move for anyone from that world. While neither record made much of a mainstream impact, they were masterpieces that used a major label's resources to magnify, not dilute, an innovative sound formed in a close-knit Washington, D.C. punk scene. Jawbox had a unique approach to that aesthetic with their jazzy time signatures and noise-rock textures, and their major label debut arguably represents the pinnacle of D.C. post-hardcore, catching it just as it made its way into the alt-rock era.</p>
<p>But if Jawbox reasonably fit into the mainstream three years after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> broke, it wasn't meant to last. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a>'s <i>Mellow Gold</i> also came out in 1994, leading the way for the stoned, sample-happy kitchen-sink pop that was about to push ideological punk-derived music aside. In the twilight of grunge, <i>Sweetheart </i>could get away with being defiantly noisy and raw. Two years later, Jawbox's self-titled finale, which is now being reissued, showed some signs of capitulation to an omnipresent college-radio sound. A certain passively disaffected mien creeps in here and there, an awkward fit for a famously earnest, intense, and hardworking band. But a few dated details detract little from the songwriting, where rampaging fury is tempered by calculating musicianship, pitch-conscious singing, and precise ethics disguised as cut-up squawks of code.</p>
<p>Jawbox signed with Atlantic in order to play music full-time, not necessarily to become famous, and their contract wasn't onerous. They had a lot of freedom on <i>Sweetheart</i> and anatomized their sound on its greatest song, the angelically bruising <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvz1JQAPgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Savory""</a>. Nothing about it is hard-charging in the manner of classic hardcore punk; everything coils and squirms in an ominous quiet punctuated by deafening detonations. All of this is still true on <i>Jawbox</i>: J. Robbins' warm, chesty voice oscillates between an ominous croon and an octave-leaping peal. His guitar's spidery treble clashes against Bill Barbot's gnarled, almost bluesy licks, bent out of shape by a high-pressure rhythm section. Zach Barocas lays a volatile foundation, drumming around the beats at a slant, and Kim Coletta's bass embeds more zooms and fillips in outwardly brawny, inwardly delicate masses of sound.</p>
<p>But ""preserved"" is an apt term, as the record sounds more canned than its predecessor, losing some of its palpable danger. Though the guitar attack can be ferocious, the former dynamic range is squeezed in. Barbot's guitar work is perhaps more inventive than ever before, but instead of exploding into being, it more often sidewinds in and out of the mix. Relaxed, almost boho passages on ""Mirrorful"", ""Desert Sea"", and ""Livid"" sound more like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1337-embrace/"">Embrace</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8999-rites-of-spring/"">Rites of Spring</a>, early emo-core bands that influenced Jawbox. My favorite song on the album is also their prettiest ever, ""Iodine"", a sleepy, melancholy ballad where Robbins sings, with unusual tenderness, over a limpid melody painted in liquid trails of guitar. There's even a hidden song, an unironic (if not overly reverent) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7SmTUbfCP0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover of Tori Amos' ""Cornflake Girl""</a>. You can't get much more <a href=""http://120minutes.tylerc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""120 Minutes""</a> than that.</p>
<p>Signs of the times aside, there is plenty of peak Jawbox to be found. ""His Only Trade"" churns as thrillingly as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q45skdIgpy0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jackpot Plus!""</a> from <i>Sweetheart</i>, with Robbins' fiery vocal performance matching the urgent lyrics: ""Someday he's gonna wake up in a burning house and wonder what to save and wonder who to blame."" ""Empire of One"" finds a deep, exhilarating pocket in jungle drums and terse call-and-response vocals. ""Capillary Life"" is notably grand and subtle, with a multi-staged depth and scope elapsing in the usual three-or-so minutes. J. Robbins chants and spits like he means it.</p>
<p>But what did he mean? ""Best of all,"" as he sings, ""it's open-ended."" You'd call the lyrics stream-of-consciousness if they weren't so focused, the phrases and delivery so sharply wrought. Robbins' cryptic tirades have a moral dimension and an aesthetic one; they accuse and self-lacerate; they are wary of systems and alert to betrayals of trust. Two frames in particular stand out. On ""Won't Come Off"", Robbins sings, ""One second cut from the arc of a swan dive, pulled out tight to the pitch of a taut line,"" as if encapsulating his band's situation and style: An arc of force that has been pulled straight, thrumming with the strength of its own will to bend back. ""At the bottom, they all want proof, and at the top, no one's making room,"" Robbins adds on ""Chinese Fork Tie"", as if diagnosing his position between an equally restive underground and mainstream. </p>
<p>After their self-titled album, Jawbox's Atlantic sub-label disintegrated and mainstream music moved on from cleaning up punk bands. In their relatively brief existence, they made made a lasting impression on incoming waves of math-rock and post-punk bands with dissonant textures, awkward stop-start dynamics, and knotty instrumental phrasing. And if it's not their best album, their self-titled swan song, frequently cutting through its temporal trappings with that old desperation and drive, still holds up. </p></div>"|20892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20892-jawbox/|7.6|Brian Howe

The group tends to invite friends on stage, uniting players from typically insular realms like hardcore, minimal synth, and metal in the service of further saturating its already dense, imposing performances. There’s a tagline for this, New American Heavy Underground, which you can find on t-shirts. And the catalog of <a href=""http://www.ascetism.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ascetic House</a>—an art collective and tape label tied to Destruction Unit—likewise corrals sounds from the shadowy margins of accessibility. Eroding those superficial scene divisions dovetails with broader visions of liberation: Destruction Unit celebrated the release of its latest album, <i>Negative Feedback Resistor</i>, with the pioneering prison abolitionist group <a href=""http://criticalresistance.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Critical Resistance</a>, for instance. But for all of that refreshing commitment to activism and exploding aesthetic cliques, the album sounds rather familiar, an echo of its last full-length statement, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18382-destruction-unit-deep-trip/""><i>Deep Trip</i></a>, and the usual proto-punk touchstones.</p>
<p>Destruction Unit's current lineup solidified by 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17745-destruction-unit-void/""><i>Void</i></a>. Previously, the handle was a vessel for vocalist and guitarist Ryan Rousseau, a refugee from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29598-the-reatards/"">Reatards</a>. With a new lineup, the Arizonan outfit favored up-tempo, punchy beats inherited from hardcore; riffs pitched to near-total scree; and barren, windswept passages reminiscent of the group’s forbidding but awesome Sonoran Desert surroundings. It was an estranged sort of psychedelia, distinguished by what felt like elemental terror from the American southwest, but with Destruction Unit’s latest album the same approach risks exhaustion. Repeatedly evoking an arid landscape is perilous work; inspiration could evaporate.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Negative Feedback Resistor</i> is assaultive in a way that <i>Void</i> wasn’t. This is in no small part due to the rhythm section, which defaults to an up-tempo beat that lurches and bludgeons in the insistent style of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7759-motorhead/"">Motörhead</a> or even <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Discharge</a>. With their reliance on halftime breakdowns and sharp drum patterns, Destruction Unit sound inspired by hardcore, but they leave out the concision. That’s too bad. The three-minute highlight ""If Death Ever Slept"" could lead a savage seven-inch. Instead, it’s easy to miss after the album’s midway slog through redundant nine- and seven-minute numbers.</p>
<p>This lack of dynamics works better in the band's cataclysmic live show, where the band has few peers. But <i>Negative Feedback Resistor</i>’s relentlessness made me pine for <i>Void</i>’s atmospheric excursions. There are a few hazy, impressionistic moments, notably the introduction to ""Judgment Day"", but they feel appended rather than interwoven. And, as with many traits of <i>Negative Feedback Resistor</i>, the same could be said for <i>Deep Trip</i>. Indeed, Destruction Unit’s prior album opened with a song that pivots abruptly from sprint to halftime in much the same way as ""Disinfect"".</p>
<p><i>Negative Feedback Resistor </i>also harks to space-rock like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5395-hawkwind/"">Hawkwind</a>, not to mention that the core riff for ""Salvation"" is essentially identical to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">the Stooges</a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIEBHoabzE8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Feel Alright""</a>. Rousseau’s words are mostly inaudible, morphed into queasy, feverish missives, but the ongoing allusions to drugs and the bible indicated by song titles and lyrical snippets are frustratingly pat and disappointing. Off record, the band’s ideas about getting free are much more urgent, inventive, and contemporary than those psych clichés. Sadly, the band's stylistic conservatism has such a blurring effect on their records that any three tracks contain its total rewards.</p></div>"|21073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21073-negative-feedback-resistor/|6.6|Sam Lefebvre

So while his albums draw you in with the vibe—the impeccably recorded and mixed songs that shuffle bits of folk, new wave, or country in the mix but are always squarely down-the-middle rock—you return to them for their human qualities, the way they offer a manner of seeing the world, a glimpse at a perspective that feels both voyeuristic and easy to connect to your own life.</p>
<p>You have to feel for Vile when he does early interviews for one of his records and he’s asked to characterize them. Music writers look for a story, an angle, a hook, and he gamely tries to give them one, a reason why an upcoming record is different from his last few. In the case of <i>b’lieve i’m goin down</i>, he pointed out that it was darker, an album from the night, written in the lonely quiet hours after his wife and two children had gone to sleep. (My favorite quote on this came from his interview with <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/how-kurt-vile-rediscovered-the-sound-of-his-couch-for-darkest-lp-yet-20150403"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>: ""It’s definitely got that night vibe…KV’s Night Life—it’s my sequel to Donald Fagen’s <i>The Nightfly""</i>). But Vile’s albums mostly vary in smaller details; they are collections of songs that generally draw from a similar handful of influences, and Vile’s style as a guitarist, songwriter, and especially a vocalist keep them relatively uniform. His arc so far has been a process of refinement, of gradually figuring out settings in which the songs work best.</p>
<p>On <i>b’lieve i’m goin down</i>, that means he’s incorporated a bit of banjo and a bit more piano and has eased off <i>just</i> slightly on the reverb. The essential quality of his music is no different, but the banjo picking draws out a bit of folkiness, and piano shifts things slightly from capital-R Rock to singer-songwriter territory. But many of these songs could have just as easily been found on either of his last two full-lengths, which in his case is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Something that <i>has</i> changed over the years is that Vile has grown steadily funnier, and his lyrics have grown more sophisticated. Humor was always part of his music, but on <i>b’lieve i’m goin down</i> it’s an animating principle. Lines like ""When I go out I take pills to take the edge off or to just take a chillax, forget about it/ Just another certified badass out for a night on the town"" scan as goofy on the page, but in the context of the arrangement of ""That’s Life, tho (almost hate to say)"" they become something else entirely. The song is a dark, doom-laden thing, with fingerpicked guitar out of ""Can’t Find My Way Home"" and a bleak undercurrent of synth, something in the realm of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a> in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSC25Ue8Gg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black Eyed Dog""</a> mode. In this setting, Vile’s tossed-off musings, where punchlines alternate with striking imagery (""I hang glide into the valley of ashes""), remind you that every sage worth a damn knew that life was absurdly funny and tragic simultaneously.</p>
<p>The quotable lines are many. It’s been a while since I heard a description of a hangover as evocative as ""A headache like a ShopVac coughing dust bunnies""; ""I’m an Outlaw""’s banjo accompaniment might make you think of a folk ballad, but Vile’s outlaw is like one you’ve never seen, one ""on the brink of self-implosion, alone in a crowd on the corner, in my Walkman in a snow globe going nowhere slow."" ""Pretty Pimpin"" describes a moment of existential confusion in front of the bathroom mirror, with Vile brushing a stranger’s teeth before realizing ""they were my teeth, and I was weightless""—whoops. ""Lost my Head there"" has a piano riff like the theme from an early '80s sitcom, but played a step too slow, like you’re about to watch the usual ridiculous ""Three’s Company""-style misunderstanding happening in drug-induced slow motion. But then it turns out to be a tune about its own creation, and Vile’s description forever colors how you hear it: ""I was buggin’ out about a couple-two-three things/ Picked up my microphone and started to sing/ I was feeling worse, than the words come out/ Fell on some keys and then this song walked out.""</p>
<p>As compelling as Vile’s words can be, much of the magic lies in his delivery. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9474-tom-petty/"">Tom Petty</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Bruce Springsteen</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>, Vile’s singing voice has acquired an unstable accent of indeterminate origin that shifts to suit his musical decisions, rather than connecting to genre or region or even his own upbringing. Most often, he’s got a nasally twang unlike that of any other native Philadelphian, and it helps his low-key murmur cut through the wooly mid-tempo haze. That twang makes his music feel more grounded and conversational, and there’s also a bit of a ""Hey, it’s me again"" quality the first time you hear it on a new album, an aural watermark that never leaves you any doubt that you are listening to a Kurt Vile record.</p>
<p>Vile’s signature qualifier is ""I guess…""—the phrase shows up frequently in his songs. It’s easy to believe he’s never quite sure of what he’s seeing or exactly how he’s feeling. Vile’s version of reality is always slightly confused, a blurry approximation of what’s out there, one in a state of constant revision. This could strike some as lazy, like he can’t be bothered to whittle the blunt stick of his music down to a fine point, and it’s this perpetually fuzzy quality that leads people to label Vile a spaced-out stoner. But from another angle the uncertainty feels honest, an acknowledgement that a great deal of life involves making it up as you go along. Or as Vile puts it on ""Dust Bunnies"", ""There ain’t no manual to our minds, we’re always looking, baby, all the time.""</p>
<p>Vile now plays ""rock"" in the most '70s sense of the word—album oriented, guitar solo-friendly, very much about long-haired dudes sitting in a room playing instruments. That he’s hitting his peak as an artist at a time when rock music of the type he practices is falling out of favor and is becoming just another genre instead of the center of the musical universe only adds to his appeal; this is not an artist concerned with being in step. Vile’s relevance to the music world at large rises and falls, but he keeps plowing ahead, secure in the knowledge that in an examined life there will always be more to explore, another bleary morning with another unfamiliar face looking back at you over the bathroom sink.</p></div>"|20840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20840-kurt-vile-blieve-im-goin-down/|8.4|Mark Richardson

""Our music had become so incredibly dark and cold, we couldn’t really get any darker or colder,"" he says. ""I remember quite clearly sitting in a club in New York one night, around three or four o’clock in the morning, and thinking how great it would be if we made music, electronic music, that could be played in one of these clubs."" The rest, of course, is history. New Order would go on to become one of the most successful and innovative dance acts of all time, creating an aesthetic that split the difference between guitar-heavy post-punk and club-ready dance music. Some 30 years later, New Order continue to develop and refine the template they essentially created with surprisingly positive results.</p>
<p><i>Music Complete</i> is New Order’s 10th studio album, and for all intents and purposes, it’s the first thing they’ve recorded since 2005’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5769-waiting-for-the-sirens-call/""><i>Waiting for the Sirens' Call</i></a> (2012’s long-delayed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17532-lost-sirens/""><i>Lost Sirens</i></a> was essentially a hodgepodge of <i>Waiting </i>outtakes). It also reflects a series of shifts within the band, created after the departure of bassist Peter Hook and reintroducing original keyboardist Gillian Gilbert back into the fold. For longtime fans, the acrimonious departure of Hook is potentially worrisome, as his melodic basslines were so integral to many of New Order’s most beloved tracks. As it turns out, they needn’t have worried too much. New bassist Tom Chapman, who formerly played with Sumner in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27947-bad-lieutenant/"">Bad Lieutenant</a>, creates a pretty faithful simulacrum of Hook's signature sound both live and on record. Having largely eschewed the heavy guitars that weighed down much of their output for the past decade, New Order embrace electronics again on <i>Music Complete</i>, conjuring the kind of synth washes and house-y piano runs that could have easily pulsed across their records during their mid-'80s heyday, making for what is arguably the most refined record they’ve released since 1989’s <i>Technique</i>. </p>
<p>The 11 tracks on <i>Music Complete</i> essentially touch on all the things that New Order do best, from the wistful melancholy of the record’s first single, ""Restless""—a lovely <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ZHVmSuBJM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Regret""</a>-like bummer ode to the perils of never being satisfied—to the pounding eurodisco of ""Tutti Frutti"", it is as if the band tried to assemble a record based on all of their most iconic vibes. In large part, they manage to succeed. On even their most classic records, New Order can be amazingly inconsistent, the truly great songs always eclipsing the simply forgettable ones. In this way, <i>Music Complete</i> is no exception. ""Plastic"" is the most inspired bit of dance music the band has recorded in years—a sprawling seven-minute bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Moroder</a>-ish synesthesia in which Sumner’s perfectly affectless vocal—""It’s official, you’re fantastic, you're so special, so iconic""—plays against tastefully employed bits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29394-chic/"">Chic</a> guitar jangles and a classically New Order-ish bassline that somewhere is making Hooky's head explode. It’s really the only track on the record that belongs on the same kind of rarefied dance floor as classic New Order jams like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfI1S0PKJR8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""True Faith""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYwNLlTt3AQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fine Time""</a>—which means it’s the kind of slick, slightly chilly, and grandly magisterial electro pop that is essentially begging to be remixed into some kind of ecstatic 12” version that can play on a loop for days.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, ""Singularity"" opens with what literally sounds like an old Joy Division outtake—an ominous bassline and some warped guitar lines that sound as if they were being played in a room just adjacent to the actual recording studio—before exploding into a digitized electro banger, while ""People on the High Line"" could be a distant cousin to <i>Republic</i>’s ""World"", complete with chorus-echoing female backup vocals. ""Tutti Frutti""—one of three tracks featuring additional vocals from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27831-la-roux/"">La Roux</a>’s Elly Jackson—reaches for a similar state of dancefloor euphoria and <i>almost </i>gets there. As always, Sumner’s lyrics are hit and miss (""You got me where it hurts / but I don’t really care/ ‘Cause I know I’m OK / Whenever you are there."") but he always manages to sell it effortlessly. In fact, effortlessness has always been New Order’s greatest trick. The best tracks on <i>Complete</i> are the kind of tastefully deployed dance track that the band has spent decades articulating—perfect, polished, airtight—but one can’t help but wish that <i>Music Complete</i> had a few more of them on board.</p>
<p>The record’s weakest tracks are generally the most tepid. ""Academic"" and ""The Game"", while certainly not terrible, suffer from being both unmemorable and somehow overly familiar, sounding like a dozen or so other fine but mostly unremarkable New Order tracks haunting the latter halves of previous albums. Elsewhere, ""Stray Dog""—a track featuring a long spoken word passage growled by none other than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"">Iggy Pop</a>—would make for an appropriately larky B-side, but is something of a momentum killer when placed squarely in the middle of a pop album. The record does end on a high note though, with the swooning ""Nothing but a Fool"" adding the requisite dollop of perfectly-metered melancholy and album-closing ballad ""Superheated"" (featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12459-brandon-flowers/"">Brandon Flowers</a> in what one can only imagine is his ultimate wet dream of a guest spot) bringing <i>all </i>the feelings to a charmingly earnest song about lost love that sounds like it could/should have played during the penultimate scene of a John Hughes movie (in the best way possible).</p>
<p>For longtime fans, <i>Music Complete</i> is something of a return to form for New Order—complete with appropriately chic minimalist artwork courtesy of Peter Saville. The record’s carefully considered aesthetic and meticulous production bear all the hallmarks of the band’s most iconic work. Still, it’s hard to know if anyone other than the band’s legions of devotees will find most of this material truly arresting. <i>Music Complete</i> certainly doesn’t do anything to diminish New Order’s formidable legacy, but it doesn’t necessarily expand upon it either. That being said, it still sounds like classic New Order, and now over three decades deep into their career, it's kind of amazing that nothing else really does.</p></div>"|21036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21036-music-complete/|7.2|T.

At the time, a number of bands were finding inspiration in progressive rock from the '60s and '70s and pushing those sounds toward fuzzier and more frantic extremes. This was also the year that Santa Cruz's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"">Comets on Fire</a> released their well-loved record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1563-blue-cathedral/""><i>Blue Cathedral</i></a>, and around the same time that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1032-dead-meadow/"">Dead Meadow</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3482-pearls-and-brass/"">Pearls and Brass</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/620-boris/"">Boris</a> were putting out some of their best music.  </p>
<p>Ten years later, a lot of these groups have split up, moved on, or faded from view, but Dungen have proven surprisingly durable, even a bit influential. It’s hard to listen to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"">Tame Impala</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14279-innerspeaker/""><i>Innerspeaker</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/""><i>Lonerism</i></a> without hearing some parallels to the Swedish band, particularly in the sense of rhythm and the doubled upper-register vocal melodies.</p>
<p><i>Allas Sak </i>is Dungen’s first release in five years and seventh album overall. Not too much has changed since their last record, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14604-skit-i-allt/""><i>Skit I Allt</i></a>. Like that album, <i>Allas Sak</i> is split almost evenly between Swedish-language pop songs and instrumentals. And like all preceding Dungen records, it sounds awesome. Led by singer, multi-instrumentalist, and engineer Gustav Ejstes, the band is able to perfectly dial in the organic tones of vintage '60s pop, even when working with computer-based recording software.</p>
<p>While Dungen have never quite bested <i>Ta Det Lungt</i> in terms of pop uplift and songwriting, the band have also never made a truly bad record. Rather, they have remained remarkably consistent, so much so that by the time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12231-4/""><i>4</i></a> came out in 2008, audiences had probably started to take them for granted—one more record, one more Keith Moon-style drum fill, one more expertly-fuzzed guitar solo. But after half a decade off, <i>Allas Sak</i> provides some great evidence for why Dungen have endured while so many of their peers have trailed off.</p>
<p>Though Ejstes initially wrote all of the songs and even performed most of the band’s music, over the years Dungen have gradually become a group effort, with a dedicated band including guitarist Reine Fiske and drummer Johan Holmegard, and bassist Mattias Gustavsson. As a result, they’ve gotten progressively jammier from album to album. But while Dungen’s music has its share of sprawling moments, it’s seldom aimless. Even in their most improvisational passages, the band’s songs move with intention—one solo or spaced-out interlude setting up the next climax or scene shift.</p>
<p>Of the record’s instrumentals, only the guitar-driven freak-out ""En Dag På Sjön"" sounds like it was clipped from a spontaneous jam session, while the rest are deliberate and composed. On ""Franks Kaktus"", Ejstes performs the lead melody on a flute, trading riffs with the guitar and guiding the band in and out of a bongo-laden groove. As smooth as the music is, though, it doesn’t come off as arch or ironic. Indeed, you can hear evidence of Ejstes earnestly vibing out every time his notes go slightly sharp—the wind equivalent of a bent guitar note or scrunchy face. On ""Flickor Och Pojkar"", a delicate Rhodes piano melody is gradually augmented with string and acoustic guitar flourishes that sweep across the stereo field. The music recalls the work of film composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Ennio Morricone</a> in its attention to arrangement and sonic detail.</p>
<p>This obsession over small moments and gestures is important to the Swedish band’s music. A lot of psychedelic rock is focused on the big-picture freak-out—the zonked experimental and spontaneous moment where the music becomes combustible and uncontrollable. And while Dungen are capable of producing those moments, the band have always set their primary focus on hooks, both in a rhythmic and melodic sense. Just about any four bars of a Dungen song could be sampled and looped as the foundation for something else.  </p>
<p>And though the group’s music appropriates sounds and production styles from the past, it’s hard to think of a particular act from the '60 or '70s that Ejstes is consciously emulating. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-d5e32603-f19f-ef1d-8b7b-bda4f97ad703""><span>Rather, Dungen use retro-minded instrumentation and recording techniques to convey fairly modern musical ideas, removed from the established sounds of classic rock and psych</span></span>. The rhythm section, in particular, takes a strong influence from the feel and pulse of hip-hop. In this, they’re a little like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>, another band that drew heavily from vintage experimental music, but who would never be mistaken for revivalists.</p>

Within the past year, <span class=""il"">she's</span> spoken frankly about her </span><a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?2106"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>coming out experience</span></a><span>, a development in her sexual identity that has found its way into her music. Her awareness developed in large part on the dance floor, manifesting in a colossal yet loving environment that also served as a space for personal catharsis. </span><i>Inevitable</i><span> brings this catharsis to her listeners. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span class=""il"">Kmeto's vocals have always been a tool in the production of her past works, but they ring out with</span> clear and present force on <i>Inevitable</i>. Her singing is forthright but also verging on breaking, as if she was struck by a sudden wave of vulnerability. From the record’s first seconds, she telegraphs how different the stakes are for her: On opener and title track ""Inevitable"" she pleads ""When you coming back, baby? When you coming back?/ I will love you down, baby, when you’re coming back."" The unadorned sound and raw sentiment send a powerful message: Take me for who I am.</p>
<p><i>Inevitable</i> sounds sharper and smoother than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18223-natasha-kmeto-crisis/""><i>Crisis</i></a><span>, but it still feels raw, like the sort of music that is ripped in desperation out of the heart and guts—the truly messy parts—of its creator. There is an unfinished charm to her music; the components of the tracks sound like they don’t (or shouldn’t) mesh together. <span class=""il"">Kmeto</span>’s voice shimmers on ""Inevitable"" while the slow, rumbling and minimalist instrumentation dies just short of a climactic peak. It seems incomplete, but Kmeto saves it with the vividness of her lyrics and the quiver of her voice.</span></p>
<p>Kmeto has been compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a> and <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mayajanecoles"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maya Jane Coles</a>, but those comparisons feel flimsy at best. <span class=""il"">Kmeto</span> is better understood next to the criminally underrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30522-cooly-g/"">Cooly G</a>. Both make music lyrically fueled by desire, exploring the possibilities of unspoken meaning found in mood, in space and silence, and in carefully considered lyricism. The music builds as the stakes do as well.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On ""I Thought You Had a Boyfriend"", one of the strongest tracks on the record, <span class=""il"">Kmeto</span> sings about a confusing romantic connection. ""Your eyes, lingered on me as you said goodbye,"" she sings at the outset. ""And our hands held a little bit longer than what would seem polite."" <span class=""il"">Kmeto</span> sounds at once frustrated and open, and as the song progresses, the synths build and build to an overwhelming wall of sound. Is it the rising bite to <span class=""il"">Kmeto</span>’s words as she sings on the chorus that makes the song so unsettling? ""I thought you had a boyfriend/ I thought you had a man,"" she says. ""I thought it wasn’t like that/ I thought you had a plan."" After two verses, the synths wash over the listener like a tidal wave of emotions as she repeats the chorus again and again. <span class=""il"">Kmeto</span> doesn’t ask a question, but she does demand an answer.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Other strong songs on the record fit this same structure. ""Closer Comes My Love"" at first sounds like a sensual slow jam, but peaks in cacophony. ""Peak"", more of a traditional dance track, has straightforward lyrics that pair seamlessly with the slight dubstep flourishes found in the track's final minutes.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Unlike her young peers also creating soulful jams (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31259-tinashe/"">Tinashe</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29698-jhene-aiko/"">Jhené Aiko</a>), <span class=""il"">Kmeto</span>’s music refuses to slink into the background. On <i>Inevitable</i>, <span class=""il"">Kmeto</span>’s personal awakening blooms into her music, both lyrically and structurally. As queer identity gets shoved aside with the mainstreaming of electronic music, as if the queer community didn't fuel the genre's formation, it's more vital than ever to have voices like Kmeto's bringing it to the forefront. This, without question, is a record of discovery and confusion as much as it is about the power of confidence in understanding and loving oneself. <i>Inevitable</i> is a collection of slowly ripping cords, the underlying tension manifesting on tracks as if <span class=""il"">Kmeto</span> must manage simmering emotions and can’t, or maybe won’t.</p></div>"|21072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21072-inevitable/|7.8|Britt Julious

Initially born as a side project from Stephenson's gig drumming for Denton electro-acoustic outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28283-sleep-whale/"">Sleep Whale</a>, Botany has since grown into a full-fledged solo act with a peculiar net of influences: sci-fi pulp novels, <a href=""http://www.emergentmusics.org/theory/13-a-theory-of-emergent-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""emergent"" music</a>, beat architects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a>, psych and krautrock, free jazz virtuosos. It’s no wonder Stephenson has described his music as ""studious,"" and often provides long, sometimes brainy explanations in interviews about what his mood-driven soundscapes are all about.</p>
<p><i>Dimming Awe, the Light Is Raw</i>, Stephenson’s second full-length under the Botany moniker, scours away the haze of his underrated 2013 debut <i>Lava Diviner (True Story)</i>. That album, the soundtrack to an imagined sci-fi film about a ""geological religious sect hell-bent on destruction"", was dazed and occasionally too dense, but on <i>Dimming Awe</i> he winnows the widescreen approach down into what feels like a clear step forward in both quality and execution.</p>
<p>Stephenson’s biggest strength as a producer is his ability to weave all of his influences<span>—</span>Eastern-based samples, throbbing hip-hop beats, stretches of noodly ambient<span>—</span>into alternatingly danceable and meditative psychedelia. Opening instrumental tracks ""Sungblood"" and ""Raw Light Overture"" bounce appealingly between xylophones, bright-eyed melodies, and lilting vocals, even if they hew a little close to Adult-Swim-commercial territory. The circuitous and unpredictable Chicago rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32446-milo/"">Milo</a> enlivens ""Au Revoir"" and the soporific ""No Translator"", the latter of which distinctly recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">FlyLo</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17115-until-the-quiet-comes/""><i>When the Quiet Comes</i></a>. Milo is a good foil for Stephenson: The looped sampling of a laugh track and French <i>chansons</i> on ""Au Revoir"" neatly align with Milo’s meandering, stream-of-consciousness verses. ""Au Revoir"" and ""No Translator"" are also Stephenson's first time working with a rapper, an experiment that bodes well for a collaborative EP with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27805-lushlife/"">Lushlife</a> (featuring appearances from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28847-shabazz-palaces/"">Shabazz Palaces</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/"">Open Mike Eagle</a>) slated for next year.</p>
<p>Stephenson has said that much of this album was improvised, his way of taking cues from jazz favorites like Herbie Hancock and Pharoah Sanders. You can hear it in the improv drumming that clatters around in the background of ""Birthjays"" and the synth ad libbing that drives ""All Is Rite"", little touches of ingenuity that insist upon repeat listens in order to catch all the different nuances at play. In a world as carefully constructed and satisfying as <i>Dimming Awe</i>, it's a worthwhile requirement.</p></div>"|21031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21031-dimming-awe-the-light-is-raw/|7.2|Eric Torres

As an artist, she's never shied away from the obvious, but the image feels almost <i>too</i> on-the-nose, <i>too</i> apt—Lana doing T</span><span>he Full Lana</span><span>. And yet, that's exactly what </span><i>Honeymoon</i><span> gives us—</span>it<span> is Lana Del Rey's purest album-length expression, and her most artistic one.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Accordingly,<i> Honeymoon</i> is a dark work, darker even than <a href=""%20http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19449-lana-del-rey-ultraviolence/""><i>Ultraviolence</i></a>, and the pall does not lift for its 60-plus minutes. It's an album about love, but ""love"", as Del Rey sings it, sounds like mourning. The romance here is closer to addiction—something that's sought for its ability to blot out the rest of life's miseries. On the title track, when she croons ""Our honeymoon/ Say you want me too"", she's dopily hopeful as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Brian Wilson</a> singing ""We could be married/ And then we'll be happy."" The album luxuriates in this bleak space between dream and reality, which stretches endlessly from one melancholy track to the next. It's not until ""The Blackest Day"", eleven songs in, that <i>Honeymoon</i>'s static depression gives way to apocalyptic ecstasy, as she gasps ""In all the wrong places/ Oh my God"" in multi-tracked harmonies on the chorus. The moment is <i>Honeymoon</i>'s emotional apex, but it still moves at the pace of a funeral march, and the release it depicts is that of embracing rock bottom.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The morose orchestral grandeur of the album feels like an arrival point, and also possibly a dead-end: the sentimentality and drama throws back to old Hollywood film scores. The setting is pitch-perfect and a million mothballed years away from the current pop landscape; it's strange, a barometer of youth culture trading in such old music. As a singer, Del Rey sounds more like the singer of her pre-Lana Lizzy Grant days here, when she was was performing torch songs in secretarial skirts at A&amp;R showcases, looking too young to seem so haunted. Her previous two records felt like earnest stabs at finding a pop context for that voice, but they were both overwrought, and <i>Honeymoon</i>'s arrangements feel built to rectify that.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Honeymoon</i> acknowledges what, or rather <i>who, </i>we are here for. It knows that we want big, sad, fucked-up epics. It's rare to get to a chorus within the first minute, and until that point it's usually just Lana, maybe a little guitar or some cinematic strings. The programmed drums of ""High by the Beach"" and ""Religion"" wait nearly a minute to enter, and ""Terrence Loves  You"" is even sparser. Many tracks expand sleepily past the five- or six-minute mark, which is to say that <i>Honeymoon</i>'s languor takes our attention for granted. Which is certainly not a mistake.</p>
<p>While she's obviously a pop artist, <i>Honeymoon</i> feels as though it belongs to a larger canon of Southern California Gothic albums—<i>Celebrity Skin</i>, <i>Hotel California</i>, <i>The </i><i>Hissing of Summer Lawns</i>. She sings about it all—the sprawl, toxicity, the culture of transactional relationships, the particulars of the light (""God Knows I Tried"")—with an East Coast blue-blood accent (""scared"" becomes ""skaaaahd""). All the gee-whiz irony of previous albums is gone, often she sounds like ABBA's Agnetha Fältskog roused from a nap, sweet but disconnected.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like Joan Didion's ur-California girl transplant, Maria Wyeth, Del Rey sings like a woman who ""knows what 'nothing' means""—on ""High by the Beach"", ""Freak"", and ""Art Deco"" she sounds beyond longing, like it's been a long time since she felt anything at all. She is cruelly incisive on ""Art Deco"" (""you're just born to be seen""), a highlight that curdles when the careless phrase ""You're so ghetto"" comes out in the chorus. It's one of the few tonal misfires on an album that otherwise feels like Del Rey moving into the temple she's built.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">She has been transfixed by, and riffing on, America since the beginning, but <i>Honeymoon</i> pushes past easy Kennedy kitsch and undulating flags to mine something more specific. In the opening track, she sings ""We could cruise/ To the blues/ Wilshire Boulevard,"" and the name check is shrewd. One of L.A.'s earliest thoroughfares, a locus of establishing the city's car culture, Wilshire runs sixteen miles, and as architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/24/entertainment/la-ca-wilshire-boulevard-20130324"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writes</a>, ""can take you from a world-famous piece of architecture to a weed-choked lot, from a realized ambition to an abandoned one, in the space of a few blocks.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the following verse, she replaces blues with ""news"" and substitutes ""Pico Blvd."", which is working class for its duration, bi-secting Koreatown and running through Ecuadorian, Salvadoran, Russian, and Mexican communities. </span>The juxtaposition is startling and canny. In the space of one lyric, she posits the invisible, real city running parallel to the gleaming, manufactured one, sketching an arterial map of a city coursing with ambition. It reminds us of something that was the very issue with Del Rey that irritated some early on—she knows <i>exactly</i> what she is doing. <i>Honeymoon</i> just synthesizes ideas she's been vamping on from the beginning into a unified work. She figured where she was going long before she got there; with <i>Honeymoon</i> she has finally arrived.</p></div>"|21033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21033-honeymoon/|7.5|Jessica Hopper

He's produced for artists including Ray LaMontagne and New Orleans piano legend Dr. John, and helped give <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19449-lana-del-rey-ultraviolence/""><i>Ultraviolence </i></a>its sweeping, cinematic sheen.With his latest side-project the Arcs, the guitarist and vocalist steps back into the spotlight, recruiting Truth and Soul Records founder Leon Michels, Black Keys touring bassist Richard Swift, Menahan Street Band member Homer Steinweiss, Amy Winehouse collaborator Nick Movshon, and guitarist Kenny Vaughan.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Instead of coming across as a ""Dan Auerbach &amp; Co."" record though, <i>Yours, Dreamily </i>strikes a more collaborative balance, with all members receiving songwriting credits and an overall feeling of longtime friends jamming ego-free in basements (never mind the fact one of those practice spaces was New York's Electric Lady Studios). In a recent <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/black-keys-dan-auerbach-unveils-new-side-project-the-arcs-20150609"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with <i>Rolling Stone</i>, Auerbach said they were inspired by ""old soul records, Captain Beefheart, and newer hip-hop"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Much like Auerbach and Patrick Carney's well-meaning but poorly-executed rap-rock experiment <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13747-blakroc/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>BlakRoc</i></a>, the album was recorded quickly in two weeks, though fans of the Akron, Ohio's last stadium rock duo standing will find plenty to enjoy here. Rollicking opener ""Outta My Mind"" could easily be a lost Black Keys <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11358-attack-release/""><i>Attack &amp; Release </i></a>B-side and the Arcs incorporate a love of psychedelia and the Stax Records catalog more successfully than the group's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19329-the-black-keys-turn-blue/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">last outing</a>. There's a lot of influences coming together here, but they work sonically, from the clop of horses and bird chirps on the country-tinged ""Everything You Do (You Do for You)"" to the orgiastic shrieks and frenzied saxophone on ""Come &amp; Go"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">While nobody's claiming to be innovating wildly here, the biggest flaw of <i>Yours, Dreamily</i> lies in its ham-fisted and occasionally rote lyrics (""Pistol Made of Bones"" is the biggest offender). With the exception of the horn-heavy, Junior Kimbrough-referencing ""Velvet Ditch"", which Auerbach says was inspired by a motorcycle trip he took from Nashville to Clarksdale, Miss., too many of the songs here come off like failed attempts to write a Muscle Shoals version of ""Bad Blood"". It's not the first time he's sung about ill-fated romance (his acrimonious split with wife Stephanie Gonis in 2013 made tabloid and music blog headlines alike)—see also his 2009 solo album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12669-keep-it-hid/""><i>Keep It Hid</i></a>—but over the course of 14 tracks, it grows slightly repetitive.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Thankfully, his wearied tales get a welcome assist from Brooklyn-based all-female mariachi band <a href=""http://www.mariachinyc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flor de Toloache</a>, who provide ghostly backup vocals and a much-needed sense of perspective on slow-burning highlights ""Put a Flower in Your Pocket"" and quasi-ballad ""Chains of Love"" (disappointingly not an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uttV1VZUgQQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erasure cover</a>). On tender lead single ""Stay in My Corner"" (inspired by the May 2015 boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao), he pleads his allegiance to a lover claiming ""I will fight for you"" but it sounds like it's himself he's trying to convince. Like that fight, the Arcs will draw audiences (they've already been booked as a musical guest on an upcoming episode of ""Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" and are sure to be a lock for the festival circuit) and <i>Yours, Dreamily </i>draws spirited performances from its players, but works best as a one-off event.</p></div>"|21064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21064-yours-dreamily/|6.8|Max Mertens

On one hand, the purpose is simple: Richter intends for the listener to press ""play"" on the full-length digital version, nod off to sleep somewhere between the patient piano chords of ""Dream 1"" and the vocal-and-organ ululations of ""Path 3,"" and re-emerge after eight hours of music to a gentle crescendo of stretching strings, wordless harmonies, and long-tone bass near the close of ""Dream 0"". By consulting with famed neuroscientist and <a href=""http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/sum-by-max-richter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">past collaborator David Eagleman</a>, Richter has created a slow-motion, electronics-and-chamber-ensemble hybrid meant to reinforce and reflect natural sleep cycles. ""An invitation to dream,"" <a href=""http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/09/max-richter-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Richter has called it</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the third-of-a-day span between the beginning and the end isn’t some inert, sustained tone, simply meant to maintain a snooze. Instead, it’s an ever-shifting set of meticulously performed pieces that both affirm and expand Richter’s reach as a composer. He webs together string quartets and electronic drones, tense duets for piano and violin, and somnolent keyboard meditations. Richter brings most of his interests as a composer to bear here, too. He blends an Arvo Pärt-like sense of motion with deep, low notes and shimmering drones that reflect his past in electronica and adoration of Brian Eno. His love of high-minded concepts, previously reflected by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6917-the-blue-notebooks/"" target=""_blank"">the likes of his essential <i>The Blue Notebooks</i></a>, meets his exquisite, human touch as a pianist. </p>
<p>So should you use <i>Sleep </i>as directed, as ""a landscape … where people could fall asleep""? Or should you sit upright and let the beguiling Richter ease your daylight hours? Can you actually do both?</p>
<p>Richter, of course, is not alone in his quest to help listeners rest better. Sleep is an active avenue of both art and commerce—in large part, it would seem, because we do not get enough of it. The ceaseless streams of social media feeds and on-demand entertainment have intensified that diagnosis. According to <a href=""http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/sleepless-in-america/episodes/sleepless-in-america/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sleepless in America</i></a>, a National Institutes of Health-supported documentary aired last year by National Geographic, the average person now dozes thousands of hours less than they once would have, a condition that comes with profound physical and mental symptoms. Instead, we <a href=""http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/07/23/Sleepless-in-America-A-32-4-Billion-Business"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spend billions of dollars every year</a> on ways to get more sleep, from medicines that induce it and conditions that foster it to beds that support it and systems that monitor it. We write books <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2015/08/21/433520796/mom-and-toddler-put-sleep-inducing-rabbit-book-to-the-test"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">meant to reward children </a>for falling asleep, and in a rather Orwellian twist, we <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110613093500.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">weed out employees</a> whose sleep disorders might disrupt productivity.</p>
<p>And when we do get it, we brandish it, whether bragging about how good it felt, analyzing our dreams, or funneling pieces of the experience into art. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/arts/design/review-the-morbid-anatomy-museum-presents-a-view-from-the-subconscious.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A recent show in New York</a> sampled centuries of art inspired by hypnagogia, that surreal state of mind just between wake and sleep; in 2013, the hotel chain Ibis introduced a feature to guests that tracked their nocturnal movements and transformed them into a lysergic piece of <a href=""http://www.accorhotels-group.com/en/news/make-your-sleep-a-work-of-art-thanks-to-the-new-ibis-sleep-art-application.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sleep Art""</a>. Sleep fascinates exactly as it frustrates, creating a reflexive cycle that never actually ends.</p>
<p>For these <a href=""http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/us/cat/4795267"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">31 uninterrupted pieces</a>, Richter accepts the extraordinary challenge of not only aiding sleep but also translating the act into art—that is, he scores a scene he sets himself. If you listen while you’re awake, many of these pieces conjure dreamy states, where ideas seem fluid and flexible and the world around you seems somehow softer. ""Aria 2"", which arrives in the piece’s final third, turns a sublime piano phrase into a seemingly infinite maze, as though you could follow it forever and never go anywhere. Strings and electronics wash around the melody in waves, oscillating glacially between a few glowing notes like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a> at their most romantic or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"">Stars of the Lid</a> at their most staid.</p>
<p>""If You Came This Way"" suggests the sweeping, soaring motion of a symphony, though muted and slightly distant, as if it were being played in another room of the same building. The action grows grand only for an instant, testing the limits of your reverie only to galvanize it a moment later. And the gorgeous ""Song / Echo"" seems to do for chamber pop what <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a> has long done for folk rock—disassemble it and scatter the elements in a cloud, making something so wide and gentle that you think you might be able to live inside it. You can snooze in any of these songs. Just don't think about all you will miss.</p>
<p>In talking about this eight-hour nightlight of sound, Richter has often lamented the pace of the modern world and the torrent of information that many of us must face each day. ""We have to curate our own information space and that’s quite a big deal to do,"" <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/18458-max-richter-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told <i>The Quietus</i></a>. ""You’ll still have to make tons and tons of choices and spend so much of the day reading all these different messages which will give you tons of reading. So sometimes a pause is a good thing.""</p>
<p>That idea aligns Richter with the researchers and marketers trying to give people a chance to check out for eight consecutive, recuperative hours, yes. But his use of the word ""pause"" also reflects the way I’ve enjoyed <i>Sleep </i>the most—not as a sleep aid but instead as a relaxing agent. Most of this music is indeed calming not to the point of boredom, where I <i>need</i> to sleep through it, but so that I simply <i>want</i> to sit still and listen and ponder. And though Richter took considerable pains to make <i>Sleep </i>seamless, the payoff of hearing it as a whole (a rather exhausting proposition, ironically) versus the resources required to do so is incredibly low. The music shifts between and slowly recycles parts, so you consistently wind up at some place very close to the start. Instead, I like to push ""play"" in random places and listen for an hour or so, a move that allows me to hear Richter at glorious work and gives me the chance for the restorative ""pause"" for which he’d hoped. This music is absorbing. You'll want to pay attention, to shut out other concerns. The stretch between the narcotic ""Chorale / Glow"" and the twinkling ""Non-eternal"" is perhaps my favorite segment for this reason; it’s an immersive sampler of Richter’s past successes and some new ideas, blurring into one.</p>
<p><i>Sleep</i>, then, is simply too didactic as a name. It’s a command that tells us how to enjoy something that clearly has other uses. That handle, combined with Richter’s conceit, has turned the record into a kind of clickbait story, too, which seems entirely antithetical to Richter’s point. (""That 8-Hour Sleep Album—Explained,"" <a href=""http://time.com/4022816/max-richter-sleep/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">offers the <i>Time</i> headline.</a>) <i>Pause</i> and <i>Rest</i> come closer to Richter’s ultimate goal of simply taking some time out from the whirlwind around you. At its best, <i>Sleep</i> feels like compositionally rigorous new age music. It’s a place in which you can settle for a while, with or without a pillow, and emerge only when you are ready to rejoin the restive world.</p></div>"|20987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20987-sleep/|7.0|Grayson Haver Currin

To his fans—he's maintained a frenetic release pace since early last decade (often under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=baobinga"" target=""_blank"">Baobinga</a> alias)—but mostly to other artists, as the majority of those releases feature collaborations with vocalists or other producers. This tends to be the first thing anyone mentions about Binga, and while it's refreshing, especially in electronic music, to see an artistic approach other than Genius Lone Wolf, it's also resulted in a highly variable catalog that has obscured anything resembling a signature touch or sound. <i>Wasted Days</i>, Binga's proper debut record, again features a host of MCs and offers a robust 17 tracks (a four-sided LP version is trimmer) but stands as his most realized and bountiful work yet, synthesizing two decades of UK bass music into something vigorous and modern.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Binga is a child of UK rave culture, and his production style has flitted between drum'n'bass, grime, and dubstep. Grime's resurgence, as both a pop and underground phenomenon, has refocused UK music's relationship with dancehall culture, as MCs have increasingly stepped back into the booth. Before grime, though, MCs played a large role in DJ sets, toasting over jungle and UK garage sets. It's this loose, improvisational feel that defines <i>Wasted Days</i>, as vocalists shuffle through tracks Binga has tailored to showcase their slurring patois. Their muddied taunts and boasts offer crucial texture and melody to Binga’s drum-heavy chambers, leaving the tracks in a liminal space between structured song craft and narrative-driven rap.</p>
<p>Putting a precise name on Binga’s productions proves difficult. They have the tempos and streamlined tech-y-ness of modern-day drum’n’bass (the album is on <a href=""http://www.criticalmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Critical Recordings</a>, the pre-eminent home for underground drum’n’bass in 2015), eschewing cut-up breakbeats in favor of sound design. Its slithering melodies and dub-heavy sound recall grime and dubstep, and rap and footwork has seeped into Binga’s work just as it has general UK dance culture. It’s the rare record for which the imprecision of the term ""bass music"" is a positive. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At times <i>Wasted Days</i> feels like someone shined a spotlight into whatever dungy corner Kevin Martin’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/539-the-bug/"">the Bug</a> project has inhabited the past few years, fumigating the living room and disinfecting the kitchen. The two share a love for UK soundsystem culture, but Binga’s version is far less blunted and menacing. On tracks like ""Mind and Spirit"" and the title cut (featuring frequent Martin collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6033-warrior-queen/"">Warrior Queen</a>) Binga’s productions advance in sustained, athletic bursts, moving explosively between verses. Opener ""Believe"" largely consists of a rapid bursts of sub-kicks, leaving plenty of headroom for MCs Redders and Rider Shafique’s id-driven swagger.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On ""Stormy Weather"" and ""Reclaim"" (which features fellow bass explorer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28615-om-unit/"">Om Unit</a>) Binga manages to ease off the gas and offer more contemplative work without sounding lame or maudlin. They offer just enough variety, even if the combination of Binga and the MCs suggests harder/better/faster/stronger is the correct impulse. What’s remarkable though is how well <i>Wasted Days</i> comes together, and how easy it is to return to a 17-track collaborative album of indeterminate style; the degree of difficulty in actually pulling this off shouldn’t be understated, and you need look no further than the last Bug <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19742-the-bug-angels-devils/"">album</a> to see how easily this kind of project can bog down. <i>Wasted Days</i> manages to provide a grand stage not just for the MCs but, at last, for Binga’s talents as well.</p></div>"|21084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21084-wasted-days/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

""You's a fake and your man's a clown,"" she raps on the intro, leveling barbs at an invisible adversary.  She recalls the huffy, hedonistic bravura of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2614-lil-kim/"">Lil' Kim</a>—right down to calling your man a bird. ""If he with me then you know I make him eat it proper, cuff my hands and show me if you're down to be the poppa, poppa."" Wielding Biggie's nickname like punctuation, it's inarguable that she's paying homage to one of her borough's finest.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Phone Call"" resumes the schtick, this time over a beat. It's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM9zpTTZirk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Phone Tap""</span></a> minus the <i>mise en scène</i>: an old school, pre-social media kind of goading. The message is that DonMonique, without being too <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"">Joey Bada$$</a> precious about it, feels like an old school rapper. Stelios Phili, DonMonique's producer, helps further the allusion. Of the seven beats that follow the intro, no less than three invoke the crisp, airy, neck-cracking loops of the late '90s. ""UNTLD"", in particular, channels <i>Blunted on Reality</i>-era Fugees. <i>Brrrraps</i> waft about the track while guest rappers Remy Banks and Wara duck and weave, playing the Pras and 'Clef to DonMonique's sneering Lauryn. ""Jada"", the EP's closer, fades out with a clip featuring Jada Pinkett in the classic all-women heist flick, <i>Set It Off</i>. And on ""Fifty Kay"", over Stelios' brisk drums, guest rapper Noah Caine makes all these '90s fantasies explicit: ""Me and Don the new Biggie and Kim.""</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a>, who worked through his own formative influences before breaking out to become one of rap's premiere weirdos, cuts enthusiastically in like a Kramer entrance on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17557-donmonique-tha-low-ft-slayter-and-danny-brown/"">""Tha Low""</a>, which features a honky-tonk piano loop over smoke-thick bass and boom bap drums. His presence energizes what is otherwise a classic street-to-stage come-up story (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17557-donmonique-tha-low-ft-slayter-and-danny-brown/"">DonMonique's said</a> that it's inspired by Wu-Tang's ""C.R.E.A.M."") ""I don't serve no more, bookin' shows off the flows,"" raps DonMonique. On the next verse Brown mirrors the sentiment by looking back: ""Remember when I was thirsty, couldn't even afford the orange juice.""</p>

It's the most pop-sounding track on the EP, with slithering hi-hats and an Auto-Tuned hook that bears traces of the now. I's good, but not the album's best song. With </span><i>Thirst Trap</i><span>, DonMonique makes a case for a certain kind of nostalgia: one that's not about lifting classic cadences and rhyme schemes, or cloyingly idealizing the more noble values of a bygone era. This is not a treatise on real hip-hop. Instead, DonMonique zooms in on the lean, mean rapping that made Brooklyn hot.</span></span></p></div>"|20954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20954-thirst-trap-ep/|6.8|Anupa Mistry

In that time, she's also <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47711-video-julia-holter-and-nite-jewel-what-we-see/"">worked with</a> electro-pop act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"">Nite Jewel</a> and psych-folk cult favorite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3422-linda-perhacs/"">Linda Perhacs</a>, and in all of this activity, you hear her restlessly pinpointing and subsuming new, piquant sounds. Those sounds range widely, from French impressionist classical music and 17<sup>th</sup>-century madrigals to Talk Talk's jazz-infused post-rock, from the avant music-drama of Robert Ashley and Meredith Monk, to the pop songwriting that evolved in the hills of her Los Angeles hometown in the 1970s. But though these names remain on the tip of your tongue as you listen to her music, none of them describe Holter; they are only points on a broader and more inscrutable map. </p>
<p>Her latest album, <i>Have You In My Wilderness</i>, is by some measure her sunniest and most accessible. There is no overarching concept uniting the music, no references to Euripides or '50s MGM musicals. As Holter told <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1823765/qa-julia-holter-on-her-new-album-have-you-in-my-wilderness/franchises/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Stereogum</i></a>, she ""[made] up stories for every song"" for <i>Have You</i>, but this being Holter, our glimpses of each ""story"" are brief and foggy, and the vignettes themselves are often plagued by ambiguities (""I hear small words from the shore/No recognized pattern"")  and moments of overpowering grief or wonder. More questions are asked than answers given in her often-unrhymed prose poems, and statements fold into themselves dizzyingly: ""Figures pass so quickly that I realize my eyes know very well/It's impossible to see who I'm waiting for in my raincoat"" (""Feel You""). Like a good student of the art music world, Holter clearly hopes that listeners will nurse their own impressions.</p>
<p>The music has also shifted, gaining warmth and weight while remaining enigmatic. <i>Lo</i><i>ud City Song</i> was a mess of stylistic dissonances working in the service of one discrete story (borrowing mostly from the 1958 film for the musical <i>Gigi</i>), but <i>Have You…</i> is tied together by music so airy it feels in danger of floating right past you. Despite the heavy cloak of reverb,  the record has the clear sound of a small rock band playing the studio, highlighting the inventive but uninvasive upright bass and percussion of Devin Hoff, Corey Fogel and Kenny Gilmore. The haze is also dialed back on Holter’s vocals, making them crystal clear at crucial moments. </p>
<p>Despite the breezy, poppy feeling of  the singles ""Feel You"" and ""Sea Calls Me Home"", the choruses are not as immediate as those on the earworm-heavy <i>Ekstasis</i> or <i>Loud City Song</i>. But in looser, through-composed songs like the sensual torch ballad ""Night Song"" and jazz-fusion-inflected ""Vasquez,"" Holter find other, deeper ways to hold our attention. In ""Betsy on the Roof"" –  an inspired reworking of a song Holter previously recorded on 2010’s <i>Live Recordings </i>– she drifts in and out of muted speaksong, sliding from pealing, Newsom-like tones into throaty speech. The chorus (""’Uh oh,’ she said/What of this cloud?""), though, is belted and raw-sounding, and in the wordless coda her gossamer crooning recalls either Christine McVie or Judy Collins.</p>
<p><span>But what ultimately makes </span><i>Have You in My Wilderness </i><span>transcendent – and unique in Holter’s catalogue – is its intimacy. The atmosphere is often light-hearted or even parodic:</span> In the  giddy ‘70s singer/songwriter melismas of ""Sea Calls Me Home,"" the husky, Marlene Dietrich-like delivery of ""How Long?"" or the jokey, clap-trap country shuffle of ""Everytime Boots,"" you hear Holter trying on sounds like costumes, sometimes for only a bar or two. Ironically, the more she shapeshifts, the more we seem to get to know her. For an artist who could sometimes seem forbidding or remote, <i>Have You In My Wilderness</i> feels humane,  and with each new release, it seems like a bit more of the personal is teased out of Holter's stately, high-concept approach. <i>Have You In My Wilderness</i> embraces the specific, rather than the eternal, and in her <span>narrowed focus</span><span> you can sense a palpable self-confidence and a hard-won precision.</span></p></div>"|20825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20825-have-you-in-my-wilderness/|8.4|Winston Cook-Wilson

Lady Gaga positioned herself as a benevolent ally to the marginalized despite being white, thin, blonde, and rich. Feminism, once an ideological haven, has now become a buzzword bastardized beyond recognition because we insist on aligning its values with celebrities. What keeps the status quo—particularly as it pertains to money, power, and beauty—intact is a kind of cultural phagocytosis: devouring difference in order to bastardize and co-opt.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Part of the appeal of Mykki Blanco, a multigender-identifying performance artist and musician, has been his refusal to become prey. ""I would rather be famous like Insane Clown Posse, than A$AP Rocky,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8793-we-invented-swag/"">Blanco said</a> in 2012, helping situate the shock-rock roots of his debut LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17350-cosmic-angel-the-illuminati-princess/""><i>Cosmic Angel: Illuminati Prince/ss</i></a>. At the time, Blanco was amongst a cohort of ‘gay rappers,’ all finding critical acclaim—and <a href=""http://fashionista.com/2012/03/move-over-azealia-banks-212-this-is-fashions-new-anthem"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fashion week placements</a>. But Blanco didn’t just survive the mainlining, he got harder.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Listening to </span><i>C-ORE</i><span>, Blanco’s loud, new collaborative project, feels a bit like fear closing in on itself. Out on his new !K7 imprint, Dogfood Music Group, </span><i>C-ORE</i><span> is an album that amplifies the psychic tensions of living under ""conventional cultural boundaries and constructs,"" as Blanco says in the press release. Blanco, Yves Tumour, Psychoegyptian, and Violence put to music a dense prognostication of a world within sight, where subcultures and identities rise up to claim their right to expression. </span><i>C-ORE</i><span> doubles down on being outsider and punk in both aesthetic </span><span>and</span><span> practice.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""They don’t wanna see a man in a dress succeed,"" he says, setting up the threat that is ""Coke White, Starlight"". A reverberating clank, produced by Jeremiah Meece of The-Drum, the song ensnares you with its righteous rage and then pushes you to dance as it clicks into double time. It’s just one of two Blanco tracks on </span><i>C-ORE</i><span>—the other is ""Paw"", an aqueous, drumless, EKG-bleep—but it’s an entry point to an alternative space where it’s okay to still think things are amiss in the world. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> Most of </span><span><i>C-ORE</i> </span><span>is a chasm of noise. </span>Like a key scraping at a car door, Violence etches guttural raps onto piano and strobe-synth beats. Airhorns signal his impending verse on ""Saturn"". The four contributions by Yves Tumour are mostly wordless: ""Histrionic"" is a three-part suite of dank, hissing, convulsing sound and explosion, which find contrast in the mellow, minimal, hi-hat-driven stutter of ""Childish"". And one of <i>C-ORE</i>’s real standouts is the ""LBCD"", by Psychoegyptian. ""My rap name used to be Little Soda, Little Child Soldier, Little Not Sober, Little I Might Make You Get Melanoma,"" he bellows, his taunting cadence like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29999-azealia-banks/"">Azealia Banks</a> meets Mark Hoppus. Later, on ""Lullaby"", he borrows the drunken slur of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a>-via-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32825-travi-scott/"">Travis Scott</a>. These moments moments of humor help leaven a project that might seem high-minded and self-serious.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Earlier this year, a few months after the release of his third project <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20002-mykki-blanco-gay-dog-food/"">Gay Dog Food</a></i>, <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2015/03/24/mykki-blanco-quits-music-to-pursue-investigative-journalism/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blanco announced</a> he’d be leaving music and rap to pursue investigative journalism.<i> C-ORE</i> isn’t a <i>Kingdom Come</i>-like statement of return, but it’s also not a departure. As a collaborative work, it documents multiple experiences of life on the margins of America, of music—putting it all on blast.</p></div>"|20960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20960-mykki-blanco-presents-c-ore/|7.0|Anupa Mistry

The single’s sound perfectly matched the attitude of its lyrics: a minor-key piano loop anchored a surprisingly powerful series of verses about a miserable party experience. ""Really, I would rather be at home by myself,"" Cara sang, demonstrating a well-defined personality and no small amount of self-assuredness. People noticed. ""Here"" debuted at #4 on the Billboard/Twitter Emerging Artists Chart. Lorde, Taylor Swift, and Drake <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6678428/alessia-cara-interview-drake-cosign-taylor-swift-know-it-all-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">co-signed her</a>. The <i>New York Times</i> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/arts/music/alessia-cara-speaks-up-for-the-outsiders-on-here.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">profiled her</a>.</p>
<p>Less than six months later, she's made a fast transition from ostensible outsider to insider. An ""antisocial pessimist"" who’d rather not have been invited to the party in the first place is quite suddenly the toast of the pop scene, her songs in heavy rotation on Beats 1. Cara finds herself a priority for <a href=""http://www.defjam.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Def Jam</a>. They’ve quickly capitalized on her success with an EP, <i>Four Pink Walls</i>, which packages ""Here"" next to four other songs, three of which are very different from that first hit.</p>
<p>Cara has a strong voice but lacks the power of an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31708-ariana-grande/"">Ariana Grande</a>, let alone a Mariah or a Whitney. Nevertheless, the label seems to think she’s best off belting anthems on the familiar subjects of teenage-dom. ""Seventeen"" kicks off the record with a vocal loop, a simulated handclap, and stirring chords that build into a hook about listening to your parents and appreciating your youth. Sometimes you can hear Cara’s spiky attitude poke through the sweet, pop polish. For instance, in response to her mother’s earnest advice about staying grounded, Cara rolls her eyes: ""Yeah, I guess that sounded nice when I was 10.""</p>
<p>But—spoiler alert—she accepts the advice, and it becomes the song's focus. This sense of giving in to conventionality is also present on the record’s other anthem, the even catchier ""I’m Yours"", which, with its fluttery melodies and earthshaking chorus, could have fit in nicely on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"">Haim</a> album. Some of ""I'm Yours"" is seemingly meant to reflect an antisocial pose—this time toward a guy—but it's more poutily flirtatious than anything else. ""Oh how rude of you, to ruin my miserable, and tell me I’m beautiful,"" she sings. ""I'm mad at you for being so cute.""</p>
<p>There’s no reason to expect Cara to be permanently frozen into a charmingly grouchy position. But the specificity of ""Here"" has given way to blander, faux-outcast posing. ""Seventeen"" and ""I’m Yours"" are both well-constructed pop songs, sugary lyrics and all, and it’s easy to imagine them as huge hits. The worst track here, as its name suggests, is ""Outlaws"". Its cheerful, burping horn and tinkling keys don’t seem to do anything for Cara, as she croons that her partner is ""the shine into her star."" She sounds properly Stepford-ized, almost completely without her personality.</p>
<p>That leaves us with the title track, a boom-bap, neo-soul closer that shares more musical DNA with ""Here"" than anything else on the EP. And suddenly, the girl with her own opinions and feelings is back. She sounds comfortable vocally, and you can hear shades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1944-lauryn-hill/"">Lauryn Hill</a> (who Cara has said she admires) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"">Erykah Badu</a>. This is also the track where Cara lets us back into her shyness. She tells the story of her sudden fame, going ""from ‘when boredom strikes’ to ‘Ms. Star on the Rise,’"" she sings. ""But those four pink walls, I kind of miss them, man.""</p>
<p>The four pink walls are her bedroom, where she was first discovered posting clips to YouTube, before she was snatched up by Universal Music Group.

On the title track of <i>Acne/Ears</i>, they're ready to tell their own. It's as unflattering as you'd expect from a song called ""Acne/Ears"", two facial features that seem to exist for the sole purpose of causing adolescent embarrassment. ""Some boys are filled with piss and vinegar/ Some boys are filled with just pus and blood,"" John Gleason sings, recalling the days when his breakouts were so profuse, he didn't even bother going to school. It's similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29129-strand-of-oaks"">Strand of Oaks</a>' breakthrough single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16824-goshen-97/"">""Goshen '97""</a>, in which a sullen teen finds relief by singing terribly in the mirror even when he could hardly bear to look at himself.</p>
<p>As Gleason inventories his musical, physical, and spiritual failings throughout <i>Acne/Ears</i>, he becomes an avatar for an easily identifiable nowhere man<span>—</span>the guy who trudges through high school without much distinction or even the dignity afforded by being a true weirdo, starts a band, gets a job, and never gets quite far enough away from his origins to forget his past life as a pockmarked loner. On the album centerpiece ""Donna (Reno)"", Gleason thinks back on every book he's read and forgot, every show he was too drunk to remember, and shrinks from the laughter of construction workers and a middle finger from a bus full of schoolchildren. His only wish is to be cremated and baked into the highway, ""so you can say I helped build something."" But otherwise, Gleason tries to turn his liabilities into assets on <i>Acne/Ears</i>—misery as an opportunity for character building, introspection as a bullshit detector.</p>
<p>At its best, <i>Acne/Ears</i> unassumingly places itself within reach of New Jersey's A-list of confessional indie rockers. But it lacks a true sense of stakes<span>—</span>Gleason's take on romance occasionally bears the startling bite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4626-the-wrens"">the Wrens</a> on <i>The Meadowlands</i>, but otherwise his insights pass after a brief sting, like those kids on the school bus. Nor do Roadside Graves have the youthful brass or ambition to impose its will on naysayers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus"">Titus Andronicus</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27599-cymbals-eat-guitars"">Cymbals Eat Guitars</a>. The lack of urgency can sometimes show just in the inescapable fact that this took four years to make. There are questionable binaries in ""Surfin'"" that feel at least that many years behind the cultural conversation, and the rousing coda of ""Acne/Ears"" is sunk by archaic gendering of what <i>true rock'n'roll</i> means—""Somebody please wake up those girls in the back on their phones/ Ears are meant to be destroyed by boys in basements making noise.""</p>
<p>Though they're now signed to the esteemed <a href=""http://dongiovannirecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don Giovanni</a> label, Gleason works as a second-grade teacher and the rest of the band is spread out across the country; ""no big tours planned now but hopefully one day!"" reads a post on their <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/43528078750/photos/a.239816018750.134805.43528078750/10153352979148751/?type=1&amp;comment_id=10153353012278751&amp;reply_comment_id=10153353014003751&amp;total_comments=1&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a>. Gleason spends a stray thought in ""Donna (Reno)"" dreaming of getting married, moving in with his cousins back in Jersey, and quitting Roadside Graves. It's unclear whether he sees any of that as progress or resignation, but for the time being, he finds a way to live in the moment by expressing disarming sincerity on the title track—""I'm just happy you're listening.""</p></div>"|21046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21046-acneears/|6.9|Ian Cohen

In a world of unending and presently meaningless commercial riffs on the infamous <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> artwork (<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=unknown+pleasures+artwork&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMIkbD_rIH8xwIVQ5COCh3fnwqA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">look, you can get it printed on leggings!</a><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=unknown+pleasures+artwork&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMIkbD_rIH8xwIVQ5COCh3fnwqA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a>), the Manchester quartet are the first reference for people who don’t know much about the subgenre—that’s not a slight, simply a fact.</p>
<p>Post-punk is rich and expansive territory, though, and there have been bands mining it consistently from 1978 onward. Even among the glut of bands currently exploring the first-wave strain of post-punk, East Berlin’s Diät stand out, much like their labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30145-total-control/"">Total Control</a>. Their song structures are playful and unique, their riffs memorable, their lyrics sly and clever, and their rhythm section unbelievably taut (check the drum solo that opens <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17593-diat-toonie/"">""Toonie""</a>). While there will doubtless be comparisons to Joy Division, I hear more Blitz circa <i>Second Empire Justice</i> in the guitar lines (bless Diät’s hearts for using the chorus pedal to genuine effect rather than just applying it flat across the entire record), more Crisis in the politic, more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/307-bauhaus/"">Bauhaus</a> in the unfettered energy of the playing, more Modern English circa <i>Mesh and Lace</i> in the song structures.</p>
<p>Diät are more than the sum of their influences, and they prove what I suspected from their first two 7""s, released in <a href=""https://ironlungpv.bandcamp.com/album/pick-a-line-no-accent-7-lungs-031"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2012</a> and <a href=""https://ironlungpv.bandcamp.com/album/pick-a-line-no-accent-7-lungs-031"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://ironlungpv.bandcamp.com/album/everyday-hinge-bracket-7-lungs-037"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2013</a>: their debut LP was worth the several-year wait. These songs were worked to the smallest detail. ""Young and Successful"" is wry commentary on how we internalize the capitalist work ethic, and on the line ""Write a manifesto, write a shopping list,"" the song ends abruptly, hanging, grasping, as it should. ""Hurricane"", with its slow percussive build and sharp riff, is about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Dorner_shootings_and_manhunt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris Dorner</a> and the inherent tensions of policing, and the subject fits perfectly with the ominous instrumentation. ""Nightmares"" is fast and meaty and propulsive, more punk than post-.</p>
<p>There’s also a Cannanes cover on this record, of all things, and it is a really good one: that is to say, it does right by the well-loved original while putting Diät's own powerful spin on it. This brings me to the title of the album—<i>Positive Energy</i> might seem like a misnomer upon first bleak recognizance, but it’s not. Look no further than a cover of a song by a well-loved Australian indie pop band (some say they were among the '80s twee originators) on a dark punk record for the truth: ""positive energy"" isn’t an ironic pose for Diät. It’s not the kind of sarcasm that goes nowhere. It’s in their approach to music—sarcasm as a way to get to the heart of the matter, with the beating heart still going despite the outside world’s many attempts to still it, that heartbeat being the most important thing, the only thing.</p></div>"|20994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20994-positive-energy/|7.0|Jes Skolnik

He favored post-production tricks that made him either sound trapped in a well or a bouncy castle, but he always sounded <i>alone</i>, and the music bore none of the visceral signifiers of rock. But he'd likely call his previous work ""insular"" now, created at a point when he was lucky enough to talk about love, death, and the societal contract as abstractions and avoid dealing with the <i>real</i> shit going on inside of him. After the release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17672-youth-lagoon-wondrous-bughouse/""><i>Wondrous Bughouse</i></a>, Powers cancelled a run of tour dates after the drowning of a close friend. Up to this point, Powers already seemed like a guy who'd bruise from a stiff wind; <i>Savage Hills Ballroom</i> has him feeling everything with even greater sensitivity.</p>
<p>This is first time we can hear what Powers actually sounds like<span>—</span>the piercing clarity of <i>Savage Hills Ballroom</i> has to be a reaction to the muffled bedroom ambience and warped kaleidoscopism that respectively defined <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15873-the-year-of-hibernation/"">The Year of Hibernation</a></i> and <i>Wondrous Bughouse</i>. And the most immediate revelation is just how aggressive his vocals are. When clouded by reverb and dozens of flange effects, Powers resembled bemused warblers like Dean Wareham and Wayne Coyne. ""Officer Telephone"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17581-youth-lagoon-the-knower/"">""The Knower""</a> present Youth Lagoon as a freak-folk torchbearer gone digital, Powers adopting the keening, incantatory tones of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom"">Joanna Newsom</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart"">Devendra Banhart</a> (and even a melodic glimpse of Tori Amos' ""Crucify"" on ""Free Me""), though without the same kind of supernatural presence.</p>
<p>Powers still sounds barely a third of his 26 years (""we're all babies born too soon,"" he yelps), but it works in the context of his angriest music, since most toddlers don't know much about restraint either when they first discover the world pushing back against them. With the assistance of Ali Chant, who worked on<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/""> Perfume Genius</a>' similarly glammed-up and streamlined third album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19798-perfume-genius-too-bright/"">Too Bright</a></i>, Powers equips himself with the instruments of war<span>—</span><i>Savage Hills Ballroom</i> is full of layered drums, atonal noise, and horn sections used for both melodic counterpoint and blunt force. Even when the loping keyboards of ""Highway Patrol Stun Gun"" and ""Rotten Human"" recall Powers' standard operating procedure, the songs are kinetic, obsessed with forward motion and melodic precision<span>—</span>aspects that are completely new to Youth Lagoon.</p>
<p><i>Savage Hills Ballroom</i> is also the first time we can hear what Powers actually has to<i> say</i>, and that's by far the greatest risk on a record that's already attempting to redefine Youth Lagoon. Powers shows an admirable willingness to engage with broader societal issues, though the accusatory tone of ""Rotten Human"", ""The Knower"", and ""Again"" open him up to scrutiny the often banal commentary can't withstand: ""the clones, they've always said to stay in line,"" ""so we take a pill and trust the doctor's lie,"" ""television soundtrack drones,"" using ""computer"" as a verb. ""Through aisles of cans you walk/ 'Cause you'd rather spend than grow a crop,"" he spits on ""Again""; there's a possibility he's critiquing his own obsessive habits here, but he eventually shifts to the plural first person and becomes the guy on your Facebook feed posting #hottakes about GMOs.</p>
<p>While <i>Savage Hills Ballroom</i> awkwardly stretches to make universal points from Powers' personal distaste, his personal heartache results in the most truly resonant moments. Tucked within the civic-minded back half, the exceptional ""Kerry"" is a dramatic elegy to Powers' uncle, holed up in Vegas, on the run from the law and addicted to crack cocaine. Meanwhile, ""Officer Telephone"" finds Powers in a heightened sense of shock while mourning, the ""terrible tone"" of ambulance sirens reminding him of a time when they were too late to help. Both of these songs match the devastating emotional impact of ""July"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14776-dropla/"">""Dropla""</a> while accessing a darkness he couldn't address directly on <i>The Year of Hibernation</i> or <i>Wondrous Bughouse</i> (""I've felt heaviness creep since I turned 8 years old""). Regardless of the subject matter or the production or the arrangements, the most truly self-searching Youth Lagoon album has Powers realizing he perhaps knew his position of strength all along<span>—</span>the inner child set adrift in the adult world, left to figure it out on his own.</p></div>"|21047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21047-savage-hills-ballroom/|7.2|Ian Cohen

It’s often a distinction used by rap elitists and purists to separate rap with a supposed intellectual bent from the rap they consider low brow or obtuse. It can be an ugly, divisive term, one that stands at the center of rap’s greatest schism; it has been a defining label in many rap class wars.</p>
<p>But sometimes the term categorizes rap acts that truly exist on the fringes of the genre, acts that stretch the boundaries of how rap can sound with progressive and daring compositions. Producer Chief Xcel and emcee Gift of Gab have been one such creative force as Blackalicious, a Sacramento-based project pushing a positive, often Afrocentric message that’s more prudent than preachy over dynamic production. From 2000 to 2005, the tag-team released a trio of strong LPs—<i>Nia</i>, <i>Blazing Arrow</i>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/788-the-craft/""><i>The Craft</i></a>—but parted soon after to pursue individual interests. On <i>Imani, Vol. 1</i>, their first album in a decade, Blackalicious reunites triumphantly.</p>
<p>With <i>Blazing Arrow</i>—the duo’s seminal work—Blackalicious offered up one of the greatest alternative rap records of the last decade, a complex opus that felt seamless and simple with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28552-gil-scott-heron/"">Gil Scott-Heron</a>’s barreling profundity, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3503-uestlove/"">Questlove</a>’s drums, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"">DJ Shadow</a> interlude, Zack de la Rocha’s anarchist shouts, and rapid-fire rapping all arranged carefully on a funky sonic canvas. The pair’s last album, 2005’s <i>The Craft</i>, lived up to its title with a yeoman's approach to lyricism and a tinkerer’s mentality toward innovation, but in its quest to be an experimental marvel, it over-thought its thesis, occasionally doing too much, sonically and technically. The first of a projected trilogy,<i> Imani, Vol. 1</i> takes important lessons from both, tempering its big ambitions with subtler arrangements and careful pacing.</p>
<p>Blackalicious is most effective when Gift of Gab’s knotty multisyllabic schemes unspool without decryption and nestle neatly in the nooks and crannies of Xcel’s soulful romps, and on songs like ""Ashes to Ashes"" and ""I Like the Way You Talk"", they lock in. Gab, one of the most underrated technicians of his time, can still trade bars with the best of them, but what makes <i>Imani, Vol. 1</i> particularly powerful—and what separates it from the duo’s work outside of Blackalicious titles—is its warm energy and its infectious groove.</p>
<p>Imani is the Swahili word for ""faith"" and on the opener of the same name Amde of the Watts Prophets spells out the album’s mission statement: ""Never let life’s troubles block your flow/ Have faith and get where you’re trying to go."" Blackalicious has always promoted positivity, but here it seems less like a cultural critique and more like general life-coaching. Throughout, <i>Imani, Vol. 1</i> is driven by an underlying spirituality and palpable chemistry. It’s often about connection. The duo has joined forces once more in an effort to overcome personal trials, and <i>Imani</i> is no different: Gab suffered kidney failure just as the duo started preparing to make the record in 2012, and a ""borrowed time"" narrative punctuates many of <i>Vol. 1</i>’s loose ideas, particularly on ""The Hour Glass"" and ""Escape"". Time is a central theme on the album, especially with nostalgic glimpses into the past, like on rare missteps ""That Night"" and ""Inspired By"". But there’s also a watchful eye on the future, too (""Love’s Gonna Save the Day"").</p>
<p>Xcel productions are often rooted in the sounds of rap yesteryear, but they hedge toward the modern. On <i>Imani, Vol. 1</i>, he again bridges the then and now, lining crisp boom bap drums with splitting guitar chords, protruding basslines, and prickling piano riffs. He samples less often than he has in the past, but he still finds time to chop up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"">Lee Perry</a> (on ""Blacka"") and scratch in a vocal fragment here and there (""On Fire Tonight""). His beats aren't game-changers, but he finds new and interesting ways to follow the patented Blackalicious formula.</p>
<p>When Chief Xcel and Gift of Gab are both producing at max output, there are few rap duos more capable, and on <i>Imani, Vol. 1</i> they flex their muscle, showing little sign of rust after the long layoff. What <i>Vol. 1</i> lacks in memorable hooks, it makes up for with ferocious lyricism. That the album was even made feels like a victory, especially considering it took a PledgeMusic campaign to fund it, but <i>Imani, Vol. 1</i> doesn’t feel crowd-sourced: It is an intimate piece of work, an inspiring take on conquering personal struggle and coming out whole on the other side. On ""The Sun"", <i>Vol. 1</i>'s brightest moment, Gab spins metaphors on the darkness-vanquishing power of light, jubilantly basking in its rays, shining once again.</p></div>"|20890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20890-imani-vol-1/|7.2|Sheldon Pearce

But he's equally a fan of far more modest statements. Since 2005, his annual contributions to <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=pop+ambient""><i>Pop Ambient </i>series</a> have typically taken the form of bite-sized reflections on a single mood, texture, or tone. Now, on <i>The Emissary</i>, he strikes a balance between these approaches. It is an invitation for the listener to travel but as travelogues go, <i>The Emissary </i>features no panoramic views, no grand vistas, no monuments, no scenes of splendor. It's more of a soothing blur flashing past, as seen from a comfortable seat aboard the bullet train.</p>
<p>There are two principal modes at work across the album's nine tracks: pulse and echo. ""It Started on Wednesday"" uses both at once, and it's serene to the point of detachment, in which patient bass notes dissolve into reverb trails so thick you could smear them with a putty knife. In ""Moonshine Tangerine"", quarter-note taps are fed through filters and delay, gradually building up into interlocking shapes with a debt to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5751-robert-hood/"">Robert Hood</a>'s brand of ultra-minimal techno, but drum-free and dew-bubbled. ""The Life Of"" also brings to mind techno rendered in water droplets.</p>
<p>The pulse-oriented productions aren't always so regular, however. The opening ""St. Pop"" is comprised of short, monophonic synthesizer bursts, first fast then slow then fast again; they suggest neurons firing in some post-cryogenic scenario, and they feel both melancholy and slightly numb. In ""Hands"", a three-note piano figure reminiscent of new age pianist George Winston runs in unsteady cycles, its shifting accents conveying a simultaneous sense of stillness and movement. The same goes for ""Water Dancer"", a duet for looped guitar and sloshing waves that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>'s method of traveling without moving. The remainder of the album is more placid—""About Turn"" hangs glowing in the air like a fog that veils the sun, while ""Trip the Light Fantastic"" slows a sense of ecstatic wonder to a deathbed crawl with a minute-long fadeout. </p>
<p>These tracks aren't terribly sophisticated; as per Kompakt's Pop Ambient dictate, the album is content to take a pretty simple idea—ambient music as comfort food—and stretch it as far as it can. But there are also promising signs that Beyer isn't quite content to leave things there. As ""Moonshine Tangerine"" fades out, a scrappy guitar figure, run through tremolo, pops up from out of nowhere, and the same thing happens at the end of ""The Emissary"", this time with a tentative little piano prelude that runs for nine-and-a-half bars and then breaks off, silenced by a sigh in the background. These codas feel like riddles, hints of wormholes to other worlds that lie just out of reach of the album's sheltering ambient cocoon. They're reminders, maybe, that every journey is also the story of a journey not taken—teasing snapshots of the world beyond the train's windows as it comes fleetingly to rest.</p></div>"|21015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21015-the-emissary/|6.8|Philip Sherburne

On each successive release, they seem to be trying to find their undeniably unique voice by mixing bits and pieces of '90s AmRep brutality and funky alt-rock (Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and so forth), a mix that makes a peculiar sort of sense if you also grew up in the D.C./Baltimore area with local freeform-turned-Infinity Broadcasting alt-rock radio titan <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHFS"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WHFS</a> in one ear and any number of college radio stations in the other.</p>
<p><i>Kunk</i> is more of a prolonged howling squall than its direct predecessor, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19959-dope-body-lifer/""><i>Lifer</i></a>, though the filters on Andrew Laumann’s vocals are still set to ""cargo shorts."" Opener ""Casual"" is nearly all hair dryer guitar, that gated-distortion squeal that is guitarist Zachary Utz’s specialty; it’s the interplay between Utz’s looped noise and powerful drummer David Jacober that makes Dope Body so gnarly. The first single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17575-dope-body-old-grey/"">""Old Grey""</a>, is another standout; Laumann’s refrain ""I’m living in a trash can"" is a pretty descriptive phrase for Dope Body’s ethos, and the track bumps and screeches and spins, lurching forward at regular intervals, crashing into itself spectacularly as Laumann asks himself what this band’s life, what their particular brand of destruction, has wrought.</p>
<p>There are sludgier, heavier moments (""Goon Line"" and ""Obey""); here, Dope Body feel genuinely precarious, unhinged, and uncomfortable. This is a good move for them; they’ve always been known as a wild band, but to focus on their riffs and the hefty panic a good noise-rock rhythm section can give make Dope Body more powerful and interesting than the never-ending in-joke they could be characterized as. This contextual balance between paranoiac music and absurdist lyrics was something Dayton's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainiac_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainiac</a>, a band Dope Body are often compared to, excelled at.</p>
<p>The instrumentals on the album (""Dad"", ""Ash Toke"", ""Pincher"") are Dope Body’s version of rap skits—little unfinished goofs—and somewhat of a breath of fresh air in that they <i>are</i> sketches, pictures of the band figuring out their directions together. They seem to be stretching themselves on this record, searching to create something meaningful in an ugly world, realizing that there are limits to their subgenre-referencing sound and if they are to grow they’ve got to push themselves.</p></div>"|21024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21024-kunk/|7.0|Jes Skolnik

That is partly due to an ingenious effect: a delay pedal that she uses as a startling, mid-note pitch-shifter. But if she didn’t have anything to offer beyond that novelty, her playing wouldn’t sustain the three modern jazz groups she currently heads (a trio, a quintet and a septet), as well as her sought-after work in various other ensembles—including two different bands led by jazz guitar luminary and occasional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a> sideman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3571-marc-ribot/"">Marc Ribot</a>. With her quick, experimentalist’s mind, Halvorson resembles the great composer, saxophonist and teacher Anthony Braxton (an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaw0nsX3_JY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early instructor</a> of hers, with whom she still collaborates). On her new album <i>Meltframe</i>, a set of guitar covers, she is simultaneously employing two suggestions from her former professor’s syllabus: develop a solo act, and don’t forget to engage with the past.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Halvorson is well respected in the jazz community for the speed with which she can conceive of strong ideas. In the midst of a fleet improvisation you might hear her becoming progressively enamored of some small portion of a given melody, selecting it for additional repetition within the flow of a solo. Next, she’s slowing the tempo and turning the fragment into a rollicking vamp, while switching her amplifier’s tone. As you’re appreciating the rhythmic change, you may not immediately notice that she’s also creating a new path back toward the full theme. But when she returns to the original hook, the culmination is as satisfying as any single effect she may have used for punctuation along the way.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Meltframe</i>’s tracklist was refined during her stint as the opener for an acoustic tour by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32324-buzz-king-buzzo-osborne/"">King Buzzo</a> of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"">Melvins</a>. If at first it seems like a self-consciously idiosyncratic grab bag (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14299-duke-ellington/"">Duke Ellington</a> <i>and</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"">Ornette Coleman</a>?), as usual, Halvorson has a plan. She links these two composers in the album’s sequencing via mournful tune-selection, but uses different methods of attack to preserve a distinction. Slide-playing and tuning quirks grace her performance of Coleman’s ""Sadness"" (while recalling something of the composer’s own <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmolodics"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""harmolodics""</a> concept). Then, she slows Duke’s ""Solitude"" way down, using a delicate reverb to provide the sparest of pulses. Her playing shines in both performances. Nor is a conceptual subtlety the only thing <i>Meltframe</i> has going for it. The opening number is a finger-busting, grungy take on Oliver Nelson’s ""Cascades""—a song aptly titled, given its quickly swooping figures. Those familiar with Nelson’s soulful hard-bop sound may be tempted to wrinkle a nose at the interpretive move, here, but they shouldn’t: Halvorson’s recourse to the distortion pedal successfully underlines what an imposing riff-writer this composer was. A high energy approach also predominates during the back half of Halvorson’s exciting reinterpretation of McCoy Tyner’s ""Aisha"" (which features on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"">John Coltrane</a> album <i>Olé Coltrane</i>).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Halvorson also tosses recent pieces by contemporaries like Tomas Fujiwara and Chris Lightcap into her mix. These cuts don’t always carry the melodic jolt of the certified classics, but Halvorson’s performances show how today’s jazz still works with an awareness of popular textures, including indie rock (as with the noisy drone section she creates when playing Lightcap’s ""Platform""). </span><span>Surely, Halvorson’s most personal statements are still found on the albums where her own compositions rule. Though by liquefying some of the curatorial borders that surround jazz in the popular imagination, </span><i>Meltframe </i><span>refocuses our attention on an essential malleability that is the genre’s core tradition.</span></p></div>"|21027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21027-meltframe/|8.0|Seth Colter Walls

Music as a producer) and the punk rock antics, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a> progeny who is continuously changing shape. One minute he’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/"">Kid Cudi</a>, the next he’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>. The rager has made a living parlaying aesthetics into musical capital, but there’s value in his ability to repackage styles and sounds into something that requires little to no unpacking. After releasing a solid buzz-building free studio album, <i>Days Before Rodeo</i><i>,</i> last year, Scott follows it up with his long-awaited major debut, <i>Rodeo</i>, a master class in the pyramid scheming of rap industry politics.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Travis Scott studied carefully at the Kanye West School of Maximalism, where sounds are expensive and songs are sumptuous with rich, interlocking details and meticulously selected guests. Since releasing his debut EP, </span><i>Owl Pharaoh</i><span>, in 2013 (and perhaps even before) he’s been honing a sixth sense for emphasizing gravitas. His greatest trick is making songs <i>feel</i> big and important. But Scott has cobbled together a composite identity to compensate for lacking his own. He’s quickly earned a rep as a shameless biter, an aesthetic bender with no regard for ownership or authorship—a claim given credence by </span><span><i>Rodeo</i>’s</span><span> second single, the Swae Lee-imitating ""Antidote"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This has become the enduring criticism of Scott’s work so far: That he’s a skilled impersonator posing as a creative, a mime playing puppetmaster. (There are at least three alleged reports of creative theft, which led to </span><a href=""http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/travis-scott-is-worse-than-iggy-azalea-1682870003"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>this takedown</span></a><span> in Deadspin.) But this narrative overshadows the more glaring holes in his music. Travis Scott isn’t good at rapping—he often bawls out clunky phrases that dawdle into banality (""Always hit the gas like I broke wind"")—and his self-proclaimed status as an auteur isn’t dictated by his own talent, but by the talent of those surrounding him. ""Who do I owe? Nigga, no one,"" he boasts on opener ""Pornography"", when he’s actually deeply indebted to those in or adjacent to the Kanye Think Tank and the others he’s wrangled based on that affiliation.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One thing Scott does very well is squirm through openings onto bigger platforms, which is a talent in and of itself. He is one of rap’s premier young capitalists, an opportunist deft in the use of social currency, turning a friendship with Illroots creator Mike Waxx into a relationship with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"">T.I.</a> and finagling a meeting with Kanye West out of networking with his engineer, Anthony Kilhoffer. The strength of his catalog is almost exclusively dependent on the strength of his connections.</p>
<p><i>Rodeo</i> is the culmination of Travis Scott’s amassed networking efforts. The credits are a Who’s Who of the big names in rap and its neighboring genres: Narrated by T.I., it tells a nebulous tale of Scott’s meteoric rise and the perils of fame. The lush and often gorgeous production comes courtesy of current league leaders in rap hit-making Metro Boomin, Sonny Digital, and Zaytoven, with add-ons and attachments from a host of heavy hitters like Mike Dean, DJ Dahi, Hit-Boy, Wondagurl, Southside, FKi, and TM88. There’s standout work from Frank Dukes and Allen Ritter. Sometimes, like on ""Oh My Dis Side"" or ""90210"", beats jack-knife in two, revealing stunningly posh second acts. Sometimes, like on the nearly eight minute epic ""3500"", they have shimmering piano outros. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a>-produced ""Flying High"" fastens a surging, slow-rolling coda onto a wailing beat. The sound is a kind of big-budget alt-trap with lots of accents and gloss, like if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20810-dirty-sprite-2/""><i>Dirty Sprite 2</i></a> was executive produced by 2010 Kanye, and it often pays big dividends.</p>
<p>Many of those dividends, though, feel as though they arrive in spite of Scott. He’s easily outmaneuvered by charismatic rappers of note <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a>, Quavo, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"">2 Chainz</a> (""Crib bigger than your imagination""). Pop singers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a> and Justin Bieber both steal the show with singsong rap-like verses on their respective features. Even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"">Toro Y Moi</a> make their presences heavily felt, upstaging the Houston rapper in the process. Travis Scott’s verses are often without substance and chock full of choppy cadences, and songs without guests, especially ""I Can Tell"", are undone by the monotony.</p>
<p>To be fair, Scott isn’t without his merits. He is most effective when he harshly distorts his vocals to create texture, and in the company of others he can serve as a welcome change of pace. He has an ear for programming. But <i>Rodeo</i>’s best songs—""Maria I’m Drunk"" and ""Nightcrawler""—mostly succeed because they overcome his contributions. He's still a middling talent, and comes across as rebellious youngster that’s been given the keys to dad’s Porsche and simply asked not to wreck it.</p></div>"|21016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21016-rodeo/|6.0|Sheldon Pearce

""If you've ever enjoyed my music, I badly need your help asap."" Two weeks later, his fans had delivered and, shortly thereafter, so did Funk. At face value, <i>Thank You for Your Consideration</i> could be seen as Funk's version of ""pulling a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>""—which, as of 2015, is often shorthand for the way new music is released. But unlike Bey, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>, the Winnipeg producer's new record was neither accompanied by a plea for remuneration (fans had already donated without any promise of a reward), nor was it part of a larger marketing scheme (the album was posted on Bandcamp, rather than released via Funk's longtime label, <a href=""http://www.planet.mu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Planet Mu</a>). Instead, like much of Funk's work that came before, <i>Thank You for Your Consideration</i>'s release was enigmatic, raw, and, one must assume, sincere: ""Thanks for having my back and caring about me and the music I make,"" he wrote.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For about a decade beginning in the late '90s, Funk was a restless creative force—dropping album after album of breakcore beats in a deluge that resulted in some of the decade’s most arresting electronic music. At his creative peak—arguably 2005's ambitious, classically-inspired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8445-rossz-csillag-alatt-szuletett/""><i>Rossz Csillag Alatt Született</i></a>—it wasn’t uncommon for Funk to issue several releases a year. But eventually, his output slowed to more human levels. Four years passed between 2010’s <i>My So-Called Life</i> and 2014’s <i>My Love Is a Bulldozer</i> and, in that time, Funk himself seemed to cede momentum to artists whose own sounds softened or refined parts of the one he helped create (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"">Death Grips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31026-gobby/"">Gobby</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31225-the-range/"">the Range</a>, and the Vaporwave aesthetic all owe much to the road he paved).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One might guess, then, because of the nature of its release and Funk's prolific recording schedule, that <i>Thank You for Your Consideration</i> is cobbled together from different stages of his career, or simply a collection of tracks he never planned to release at all. As he <a href=""http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2014/06/20-questions-venetian-snares-tal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told XLR8R</a> last year: ""I think I still make the same amount of music, I just barely show it to anyone anymore."" While that may be the case, unlike other odds-and-ends albums, <i>Consideration</i>'s 14 tracks come off as remarkably—and appropriately—considered when taken as a whole. While last year's <i>My Love Is a Bulldozer</i> saw Funk experimenting with his own vocals to beguiling results and this year's <i>Your Face</i> showed a more condensed side to Snares' sound, <i>Thank You for Your Consideration</i> bursts with the explosive strangeness and mathematical focus that defines much of his best work. The album's intricately programmed drums have the loose feel of much of his mid-2000s aesthetic and Funk's dynamic time signatures spin like rogue gyroscopes feeding off their own entropy.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album opens with ""Smersonality"", a wobbly production whose groove is driven by spazzed-out synths and jazzed-up beats. For longtime fans, it's a return to form; for newcomers, it may recall Zach Hill by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>. Venetian Snares' music is often purposefully difficult to swallow in large doses, but more often than not there's a cleverness and humor that rewards deeper listens. ""Koopa Cookies"", whose name portends the glitchy chiptune that erupts from the song's placid opening, plays like a boss battle where Mario's mushrooms aren't of the legal variety. Further down the road, ""Thousand Mile Stare"" is a jungle track with a vocal sample as sinister as its razor-blade synths. Funk has also always been capable of tempering high-octane drum and bass with less combustible fare. ""Beside the Past by a Lake"", for example, uses a retro-futuristic palette to paint a scene that's as soothing as it is unnerving without feeling disjointed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While the unnamed circumstances that led to <i>Thank You for Your Consideration</i> are no doubt terrible for Funk's personal life, the fact that a plea can be answered, and that an artist can return that favor in kind just weeks later, is the sort of story that illustrates the adaptability of the Internet. While jaded listeners may view each new leak and mixtape as the next piece of a perpetual PR machine, <i>Consideration</i> is an argument for a more human view of technology. (As is clear from a recent <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2015/08/13/interview-venetian-snares-hates-the-music-industry/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FACT interview</a>, there's perhaps nobody more jaded by the music industry, or music criticism, than Funk himself.) From the patient, apocalyptic drone of ""09sept09"" to the synapse-sizzling electro of ""Ötvenöt 3"", <i>Thank You</i> stands for itself. But it's difficult to ignore the context: ""Still royally screwed, yet you've made me so feel supported and loved,"" he wrote when linking to the album. Like much of Funk's best music, it's a statement filled with tension and contradiction.</p></div>"|21067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21067-thank-you-for-your-consideration/|7.4|Nathan Reese

He visits a church and a strip club, </span><span>soaking in the city by himself</span><span>. Beal’s recent work feels born out of that movie, its meandering pace and self-assessing narrative a direct complement to the flick’s equally meditative theme. In </span><i>Memphis</i><span>, Beal’s character hits a minor breakthrough, his face bathed in blue light as he sings in one of the film’s pivotal scenes. Beal never achieves such catharsis on </span><i>Noctunes</i><span>, his latest album. Instead, he casually floats by in a billowing wave of airy soul that never quite lands. </span></p>
<p><i>Noctunes</i>, Beal’s seventh album in five years, moves slowly—<i>very</i> slowly—as he tries to channel the same ethereal ambience <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a> once did. Like the album title suggests, these are evening tunes. That they induce sleep if played at low volume is perhaps on purpose. The music just sort of hangs around without any progression, making the album seem longer than its already not short 63-minute runtime. This is a bedroom recording in the truest sense: as it plays, you can almost see Beal sitting in a dark room, calmly peeling off each note. That makes <i>Noctunes</i> a pretty heavy listen, except these songs aren’t as structured as previous efforts. The light melodies accentuate Beal’s best feature—his dynamic, gospel-inflected baritone—as he sings about personal struggles. And while he draws you in by the sheer magnitude of his timbre, Beal gets lost in the tracks too often, making <i>Noctunes</i> tough to sit through.</p>
<p>He’s got plenty to talk about, though: In August, Beal was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60689-willis-earl-beal-spent-about-two-weeks-in-jail/"">arrested</a> in Portland, Ore. on charges of criminal mischief and harassment. He’s struggled with alcoholism, been homeless, and was plagued with health complications that forced him from the Army. Last year, Beal had a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55568-willis-earl-beal-discusses-split-from-former-label-xl-for-new-album-experiments-in-time/"">very public fallout</a> with his then-label, XL/Hot Charity, and spent time couch surfing on the West Coast <a href=""http://www.papermag.com/2015/08/willis_earl_beale_noctunes.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">following his divorce</a>. He addresses those romantic perils toward the middle of <i>Noctunes</i>—on consecutive tracks ""No Solution"", ""Stay"", ""Say the Words"", and ""Love Is All Around"". On ""No Solution"", in particular, Beal sounds especially contrite. He references a ""lost"" wedding ring and the dissolution of his marriage. By ""Love Is All Around"", he gives in to some sort of finality: ""Those haunting words that she said/ ‘Go the fuck away.’"" The singer processes these emotions on <i>Noctunes</i>, though his thoughts don't always shine through, given the album's milieu and paltry backdrop. These should be great deep blues songs, but they’re missing the cohesion of that genre at its best. <i>Noctunes</i> is muddy and unfocused, and not inspirational at all. Instead, the tracks are drab and make the album almost impossible to endure.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-963e4f02-cdc7-fe4e-fc21-1b37c300ff1f""><span>Beal's output has never been polished, </span><span>but at least on his </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16454-acousmatic-sorcery/""><span>fascinating debut</span></a><span>, there was a certain earnestness to his music</span><span>. With Beal, there was something alluring about the lo-fi hiss of ""Sambo Joe from the Rainbow"" or ""Too Dry to Cry"". </span><i>Noctunes</i><span> resembles a half-baked effort to recapture some sort of personal peace. A noble exercise, but in Beal’s attempt to exorcise old demons, the LP comes off way too moody and far too methodical to resonate long term.</span></span></p></div>"|21002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21002-noctunes/|5.7|Marcus J.

What has changed, however, is her voice. Far from a whisper, it now rings out. She’s performing.<br/> <br/> Credit her time in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29313-tu-fawning/"">Tu Fawning</a> for that enhanced presence. During her solo hiatus Repp dedicated herself to that Portland band, which began as a freewheeling outlet for whatever whim captured the fancy of her and co-lead Joe Haege, be it droning psychedelia or freakish jazz. By 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16779-a-monument/""><i>A Monument </i></a>the group had discovered some discipline, playing in line with the percussive thrust and theatrical bombast of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"">the Black Keys</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"">Florence and the Machine</a>. It was a solid record, and so conveniently in sync with popular tastes that the group must have had high hopes it. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAuwF4h9tuc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">live footage of the group</a> from around that time, Repp almost seems to be practicing for bigger stages. The band never made it that far, though. They dissolved soon after, along with Repp’s romantic relationship with Haege.<br/>  <br/> <i>The Pattern of Electricity</i> is a breakup album, albeit one a bit removed from the initial sting of the split. After Tu Fawning unraveled, Repp stashed her guitar in a closet and spent a year away from music to collect herself. These songs reflect that cooling off period, capturing the early healing stages of heartbreak, when resentment and grief begin to give way to thoughts about picking up the pieces. ""Woman, shed yourself again,"" she commands herself on opener ""The Beast Lives in the Same Place"", as if recovery is something to be willed. She sings song after song with the wounded determination of somebody who understands on a rational level they’ll be all right, even if her gut doesn’t fully believe it yet. <br/> <br/> That same hard-fought resolve carries through even the album’s most sorrowful moments, like the hymnal-esque ""Woods"" and the organ-washed ""Long Shadow (with Pb)"", but <i>Electricity</i> resists wallowing in the darkness just for the sake of it. Repp smuggles some genuine dazzle into the album’s showiest number, ""Pattern the Cuts / Calm Ass Mofo"". From its minimalist opening pulses, that seven-minute song blossoms into a dapper orchestral pop suite with shades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"">Grizzly Bear</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13078-veckatimest/""><i>Veckatimest</i></a>. ""I haven't been this calm before,"" she sings, ""and now I know I want more."" Like much of the album, it’s a song about trying to channel heartache into something productive, a search for a silver lining. These songs may grieve, sometimes toughly, but they never mope.</p></div>"|21008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21008-the-pattern-of-electricity/|6.6|Evan Rytlewski

But the Japanese musician's simultaneous attention to psych rock and some of the more meditative aspects of global free improv</span><span> has helped him build a catalog of improvised music that sounds beholden to no school.</span><span> (He even funked it up with Miles Davis' great fusion-era guitarist, Pete Cosey, on the unmissable 2001 album </span><i>Fisherman's.com.</i><span>)</span><span> His skill as a synthesist is so great that it can sometimes feel self-effacing, with Sakata often appearing more concerned with a given group's success than individual heroics.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given this, it's only fitting that Sakata wound up collaborating with Jim O'Rourke, the unassuming experimental magus responsible for this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20488-simple-songs/""><i>Simple Songs</i></a> (as well as, in large part, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>'s late-period renaissance). Their first recorded collaboration—a generally frenetic, double-live 2011 set titled <i>and that's the story of Jazz…</i>—placed O'Rourke's guitar and Sakata's reeds alongside the free-time pulse of drummer Chris Corsano and bassist Darin Gray (the duo known as Chikamorachi). This time, they've added Japanese noise-electronics eminence Merzbow to the mix, but instead of upping the cacophony, the addition results in a frequently spare and considered work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Presented as a 71-minute jam cut in Tokyo, </span><i>Flying Basket</i><span> begins quietly, with Sakata lingering over a few notes and phrases. O'Rourke also avoids heading straight for the shredding post-punk that dominated his playing on this ensemble's last recording. Merzbow, too, starts softly; nearly a tenth of the album has passed before his prickly shards pervade the album. This slow, muted intro helps lend weight to the explosions that pop up throughout.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-ca4cc98b-d2ec-1b84-ce0d-47a54c1f96fa""><span>The piece tenses and slackens, passing through fits of raw soloing and quiet drones and extended technique texture. The overall feel is graceful; during one passage that finds Sakata on clarinet, he manages the trick of grouping some pinched notes into phrases that sound like charming exclamations. The interplay here, just before the record's midpoint, is so nuanced and powerful that the ""everyone go fully nuts"" ending seems somewhat less impressive than it otherwise might. Still, <i>Flying Basket</i> is another valuable document of a vital, contemporary avant-team-up. Anyone who has been following O'Rourke's varied activity since moving to Japan should want to hear this—along with more of Sakata's own discography.</span></span></p></div>"|21007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21007-flying-basket/|7.1|Seth Colter Walls

Seeing it through to the end is a show of diligence and commitment. So when Ought singer-guitarist Tim Darcy drops a fulsome ""yes"" in the middle of ""Beautiful Blue Sky""—the spectacular centerpiece track of his band’s sophomore album, <i>Sun Coming Down</i>—he’s sure to savor it. Amid a song whose chorus reads like a laundry list of 21st-century blights (""Warplane/ Condo/ New development"") and excruciating water-cooler chit chat (""How’s the family?/ How's your health been?/ Fancy seeing you here!"")—Darcy declares, ""I’m no longer afraid to die/ Because that is all that I have left/ Yessssss,"" stretching out that last letter like pizza dough on a woodblock.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s an alarming admission, one that reads like the last will and testament of somebody who’s been so numbed by the dispiriting, clockwork demands of modern life that choosing death feels like the only empowering, self-actualizing move at their disposal. But Darcy invests his ""yes"" with an ecstatic sense of clarity, as if he was </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYURDHAOTHI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=43s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>John Lennon meeting Yoko Ono for the first time</span></a><span>. Though Darcy is a poet whose voluminous verbiage often overwhelms his melodies, it’s no insult to say that simple ""yes"" is the greatest lyric he’s written—because it so perfectly crystallizes his band’s essence and purpose.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Ought make indie rock that sounds like how urbanity makes you feel: nervous, antsy, sometimes hostile, yet intoxicatingly vibrant. And Darcy, likewise, gesticulates like a dutiful office drone who’s played by the rules his whole life but just can’t take it anymore. Ought’s 2014 debut,</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19248-ought-more-than-any-other-day/""><i> More Than Any Other Day</i></a><span>, was an album of slowly unfurled epiphanies, stoking simmering tension into fiery, exultant release. Those sort of affirming moments are a little harder to come by on the more chaotic and caustic </span><i>Sun Coming Down</i><span>, but the album’s relentless drive and uncompromising attitude constitute their own special kind of thrill. If </span><i>More Than Any Other Day</i><span> was about the hard-fought, triumphant ascent, </span><i>Sun Coming Down</i><span> is the giddy, daredevil ""wheeeeee!"" down the other side of the peak.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A lot has changed for Ought since the release of their first album—not the least of which is their lead singer’s surname. (Darcy was billed as Tim Beeler the last time out.) More significantly, what was once a casual project among university roommates was promoted to workhorse touring act, and </span><i>Sun Coming Down</i><span> sounds like the sort of record that was hastily hashed out in between transatlantic jaunts. But that’s not to suggest the album sounds unfinished or is lacking focus—rather, the new album takes full advantage of Ought’s fully revved, road-tested engine and increased horsepower, in a strike-while-the-iron’s-hot move. Gone are the </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVq4mekmiKc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>hazy ambient ballads</span></a><span>, </span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXt_Jpvtu5Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quirky congeniality</a>,</span><span> and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9nzU5gvQuc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>taut goose-stepped grooves</span></a><span> that, on </span><i>More Than Any Other Day</i><span>, counterbalanced the band’s wiry freneticism. Here, Ought doubles-down on their oft-cited early-'80s Fall and late-'80s Sonic Youth reference points, handily destroying any inkling you might have had about this band following the likes of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah or Vampire Weekend into big-tent-indie territory.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Sun Coming Down</i>’s more aggressive attack pushes Darcy out of his usual agitated-everyman mode to deliver more cryptic narratives in a theatrical snarl that, at times, verges on Mark E. Smith karaoke. But while Ought’s influences may be obvious, you’re never really sure where they’re taking them: the fearsome rapid-fire rants, clanging guitar tangle and jackhammered drums of ""The Combo"" turn oddly celebratory in the wake of the song’s surprisingly cheery chorus (""Jubilation, darling!""); the bee-swarm buzz and frantic accelerations of ""Celebration"" are undercut by Darcy’s wonderfully fey, Fred Schneider-worthy exhortations (""Okay... let’s do it!""). Other songs are subjected to more abrupt change-ups: ""On the Line"" alternates between ponderous tone poem and garage-punk rave-up, before settling into a sublime third act that recalls the steady, galloping build-up of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxygqSTO1lQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patti Smith’s ""Gloria""</a>, while ""Passionate Turn""—the only time here Ought attempt to channel the nocturnal grace of <i>More Than Any Other Day</i>’s knockout ballad <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16858-ought-habit/"">""Habit""</a>—turns from swooning, stumbling serenade into a menacing, militaristic march for its final verse/chorus run.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-7258bb9d-ca4c-378f-102e-0816385f2769""><span>Even the songs that remain locked into formation undergo subtle yet substantial mutations. The opening sprint of ""Men for Miles"" sees Darcy rewriting his verse melody with each pass and, as the band lean their full weight into the song’s motorik momentum, his unyieldingly abrasive guitar noise gives way to hypnotic, third eye-prying bliss. And the aforementioned ""Beautiful Blue Sky"" may initially sound like Ought’s answer to </span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlbunmCbTBA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Marquee Moon""</a>,</span><span> but spiritually speaking, it’s their </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98AJUj-qxHI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Once in a Lifetime""</span></a><span>, a song that paints a vivid picture of cubicle-bound 9-to-5 conformity before providing you with the sledgehammer to smash it. The transmission may be a little more distorted this time out, but, with </span><i>Sun Coming Down</i><span>, Ought’s underlying message is the same as it ever was: you have the power within you to change your lot in life. When you feel like there’s no way out, just say ""yes.""</span></span></p></div>"|20913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20913-sun-coming-down/|8.0|Stuart Berman

But I like to imagine that when he relaunched Public Image Ltd. six years ago, he saw the extended careers of peers like Mark E. Smith or David Thomas—iconic singers who can make interesting music with pretty much anyone—and thought, ""Shit, I can do that too."" He’d likely snort at the suggestion, but whatever his motivation, the two latest PiL albums are similar to recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">Fall</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3284-pere-ubu/"">Pere Ubu</a> efforts: They’re solid not because of the songs, but because of the singer.</p>
<p><i>What the World Needs Now…</i> is an improvement on 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16668-this-is-pil/""><i>This Is PiL</i></a> primarily because Lydon’s vocal theatrics and calisthenics are even more entertaining this time. He rants, spits, croons, screams, gulps, and whispers, all with equal commitment. In the process he injects tension into even the most predictable music. And much of <i>What the World Needs Now…</i> is musically predictable, but not in a bad way. At their best, PiL—again like the Fall—construct sturdy grooves and momentum-building loops that Lydon sprays his voice all over like graffiti splattering a wall.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The moments when the music matches the intensity of Lydon’s singing are exhilarating. Fiery opener ""Double Trouble"" is so cartoonishly angry it sounds like a Sex Pistols parody, until you realize Lydon’s in on the joke (the lyrics </span><a href=""http://www.simonprice.dj/johnlydoninterview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>recount</span></a><span> a mundane argument with his wife over toilet repair). Even sharper is the delirious ""Know Now"", where it sounds like Lydon got dizzy trying to keep up. This synergy works on some mellower songs too, such as the shuffling ""The One"" and the soaring ""Spice of Choice"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Other mid-tempo tunes on </span><span><i>What the World Needs Now…</i> </span><span>don’t fare as well. The line between compelling repetition and tedious wheel-grinding is pretty thin for this group, and though Lydon always battles valiantly to breath life into flatter songs, he can’t save them all. Things never quite fall apart completely, though it does become tough to find a heartbeat inside the fuel-deprived ""Big Blue Sky"". It doesn’t help that the tune’s disengaging loops and arena-rock choruses last for over eight minutes.</span></p>
<p>Those kinds of struggles come during <i>What the World Needs Now...</i>'s second half, which makes the album feel a bit like a five-mile race run by a sprinter. Things end on a pointed note, though, as Lydon solves the riddle of his own album title: ""What the world needs now/ Is another fuck off!"" Anyone ensnared by Lydon’s past work will find enough here to hope he and PiL continue to seek those kinds of answers.</p></div>"|21058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21058-what-the-world-needs-now/|6.8|Marc Masters

The binary between authenticity and artificiality has remained a perennial interest for the Toronto-based musician, and it comes up yet again on her band Metric's latest album </span><i>Pagans In Vegas </i>with zero subtlety.<span style=""line-height: 24px;""> In one corner waits the natural, manifested in dressed-down guitars and Haines’ lilting soprano. In the other, the machines state their case through forays into disco drudgery, stiff synths and Siri singalongs. Over the course of 13 tracks, these two forces collide, with the latter ultimately winning out.</span></p>
<p><i>Pagans in Vegas</i> deepens the new-wave  dalliances of its predecessor (2012's <i>Synthetica)</i> with their slinkiest, slickest palette to date. Depeche Mode’s influence is impossible to ignore – opening track ""Lie Lie Lie"" and mid-album highlight ""Too Bad, So Sad"" take their rhythmic cues from the bluesy strut of ""Personal Jesus"", while ""For Kicks"" channels the nocturnal throb of ""Precious"". The cartoonish 8-bit bleep-bloops adorning tracks like ""The Shade"", meanwhile, belie a quirkier, '80s-arcade inspiration.</p>
<p>This gives listeners the chance to experience Metric in an unprecedentedly cheery context, but in the case of ""The Shade"", it comes at the cost of stirring up traumatic memories of Adam Sandler’s god-awful video game movie <i>Pixels</i>. Fortunately, the group make up for it with lead single ""Cascades"", a glitched-out dance track that casts Haines as some type of forlorn, sleep-deprived android, whispering against the percussionists’ paranoid, thumping percussion. It’s the perfect synthesis of <i>Fantasies</i>’ meaty fretwork and <i>Live It Out</i>'s glossy electronics, as well as a rare moment of stylistic equilibrium.</p>
<p>As with past albums, Haines continues to seek lyrical inspiration from everyday Sisyphean struggles. On ""Too Bad, So Sad"", she finds herself in a restless transit ""back and forth between the desert and the sea"", qualifying it with a shrug: ""who I was and I will always be"". Love proves an equally futile endeavor; on ""For Kicks"", Haines offers the least-comforting parting words imaginable to a former interest, cooing that she’d stay true ""if it was easy"" (par for the course in the Tinder age). ""I want it all!"" she crows on ""The Shade"", and as the album progresses, Haines’ self-awareness emerges as the most intriguing aspect of the album's character. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.spin.com/2015/08/metric-emily-haines-interview-pagans-in-vegas-new-album/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In a recent interview with SPIN</a>, Haines revealed that Metric have already prepared an answer to <i>Pagans In Vegas</i>: a follow-up album recorded entirely with all analog instruments. Up to this point, the band’s maintained a long-lasting marriage to the zeroes and ones, but that appears to be changing. The shift would be more compelling if it didn't feel so literal. In <i>Pagans in Vegas,</i> humans and machines exist in a binary relationship. The reality is both more nuanced and fertile than that. </p></div>"|21006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21006-pagans-in-vegas/|6.0|Zoe Camp

It is his first album in seven years, and its predecessor, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10000-steingarten/""><i>Steingarten</i></a>, was itself a kind of reboot. Early on in the Pole project, Betke was remarkably productive: In just six years he recorded five albums, and the first three of those were instant classics, despite the fact that they were all essentially variations on the same theme—an alchemical fusion of dub bass and static crackle. But with albums four and five, as Betke sought to escape the strictures of his own signature, he seemed to find only detours rather than a viable way forward (2001's <i>R</i>, featuring remixes from Burnt Friedman and Kit Clayton, has held up rather well; 2003's <i>Pole</i>, featuring the rapper Fat Jon, has not). A four-year break followed, and it must have done him good, because <i>Steingarten</i>, in 2007, was among the best work of his career. Abandoning the midrange murk and omnipresent white noise in favor of crisp sounds, elastic rhythms, and vast space, it felt like vacuum-sealed krautrock, and as a celebration of texture and tone color, it was exhilarating.</p>
<p>Perhaps Betke's unwillingness to repeat himself explains why he followed <i>Steingarten </i>with yet another extended silence, one broken only in 2011 with a trio of EPs, <i>Waldgeschichten</i> (German for <i>Forest Stories</i>). That title, like <i>Wald</i>, refers to the walks in the woods where Betke apparently looked for inspiration. That image may bring to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5821-wolfgang-voigt/"">Wolfgang Voigt</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"">Gas</a> project, whose foggy swirls of classical samples were inspired by the Black Forest and its role in German Romanticism. But the two artists' impressions of the woods couldn't be more different. Where Gas is either dark and claustrophobic or starlit and idyllic, Pole's <i>Wald </i>evokes porous thickets and branches stripped bare by the elements. </p>
<p>As is customary in his work, texture reigns supreme. Instead of melodies, there are clusters of tone—glassy drum-machine pings, brushed metal, scraped flint, the atonal shimmer of a guitar being strummed above the nut. In ""Käfer"", a junkyard guitar provides the semblance of a through-line across a landscape of crickets and electrical interference; a synthetic melodica takes the lead in ""Moos (Live)"", and wheezing organs lend both color and a viscous sense of substance to many of the album's tracks. Only in ""Myzel"" and ""Fichte"", whose chiming leads are faintly reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>, does a melodic sensibility begin to creep back into the heavily abstracted landscape.</p>
<p>The three songs designated as ""Live"" aren't concert recordings, but live-in-the-studio updates of tracks previously released on the <i>Waldgeschichten </i>EPs. That method—recording in real time, both hands on the mixing desk—is Betke's enduring debt to dub. Those dub mechanics have a lot to do with the music's flexible rhythms and odd syncopations, which contribute to the mercurial sense of flow: There are almost always more elements in play than you can track, and whatever silvery filament you choose to focus on, your attention will soon be hijacked by something else. Still, there's nothing hectic about the listening experience; thanks to its relaxed pace and gently abstracted shapes, <i>Wald</i> is every bit as contemplative as the forest walks that inspired it. It has an unfettered sense of motion that, for an artist who was once, by his own admission, stuck in a rut, sounds like the sweetest kind of freedom.</p></div>"|20880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20880-wald/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

And though she brings on collaborators like <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/28880-lower-dens/"">Lower Dens</a>’ Jana Hunter and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30314-ava-luna/"">Ava Luna</a>’s Felicia Douglass, Schneit winds up streamlining her sound instead of expanding it. <i>Parting Glances</i> hones in on her laconic delivery and dry touch on the fretboard, never losing its poise but rarely getting too visceral, either.</p>
<p>As a lead vocalist, Schneit also keeps her cool. Her sandy, stoic timbre mingles easily with the treble- and cymbal-heavy orchestrations she wraps around it with her three bandmates. When she sings over Hunter’s low harmonies on opener ""Horse Race"" and centerpiece ""Thunder"", it’s like we’re hearing two sides of the same artist. The voices twin each other, leaving just enough space to cast shadow in the valley between them, and lending an extra slice of depth to a sound field that tends to skew flat. </p>
<p>The lyrics on <i>Parting Glances</i> err toward the simple, too, but even the most well-worn lines work when folded into their surroundings. When Schneit sings ""Someone take this pain away from me"" in the first few measures of ""Fantasy"", she cracks the last word into two syllables, two notes, like the pain itself can’t be contained inside the words she uses to alleviate it. ""I’m not sure what it’s about/ 'Cause the meaning never came,"" she sings, and she doesn’t plumb further. Her pain and its weight never resolve themselves; they just circulate in an endless four-chord progression while she sings like she’s trying to keep her head above water.</p>
<p>""I’m a bad man for coming around/ But you invited me here,"" Schneit proclaims on the enigmatic ""Frank"", one of many songs where she traces only the shadow of a character and lets us do the work of filling in the rest. Most of <i>Parting Glances</i> works invisibly like that—the album won’t stand out for its depth or its guts, but finds its stride in its smarts, in Schneit's knack for elliptical storytelling. These aren’t the richest stories you’ll ever hear, but they're enough to hook you along for the ride.</p></div>"|21011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21011-parting-glances/|6.7|Sasha Geffen

<p dir=""ltr""><span>The opening track ""Gentle"" is a discomfiting funeral dirge that sets an unnerving mood early on. The instrumentation combines static-y bits of industrial percussion with rich, elegant keyboard accents, as Mimi Parker’s near-falsetto flutters in and out, sometimes multi-tracked and sometimes padded out with as much reverb as can conceivably be applied. The song's verses feel like free-associative jumbles of words like, ""gentle, battle, torture, stable and silence"", underscoring the song's fitful, uneasy energy.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That mood settles into the album, which otherwise doesn't offer dramatic shifts. Airy, luscious backing vocals and sparse, gritty instrumentation remain the mainstay of Low’s sound, and they are used to wondrous effect on the nearly 10-minute long penultimate track ""Landslide"". But there’s a real immediacy and liveliness to Alan Sparhawk's vocals and playing there that’s been missing from the group’s more recent records. His singing is so full and present on songs like ""Spanish Translation"" and ""Lies"" that it feels like a renewed bid for your undivided attention. And as much as they are able to make a conventional ""pop"" song then ""No End"" is it. For all intents and purposes it’s a pretty standard, under three-minute, get-in and get-out love song, and based on the words alone, a very treacly one at that: ""I couldn’t wait to come back through/ To you."" Not exactly a left-turn, but a welcome, additional flavor. </p>

It's got a black-and-white color scheme and an elegantly austere design, in the center of which a neatly centered photograph of a bridge rises, bleached and brittle as a wishbone, from a wintry thicket of trees. Those familiar with Rhode Island may recognize the structure as the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge—and what is Rhode Island if not a longstanding hotbed of unorthodox electronics?</span></p>
<p>But <i>Grind</i> is not a noise record, even though its darkly lustrous synthesizers could probably serve as the foundation for a pretty blistering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"">Prurient</a> track. Like the Rhode Island native’s previous EPs for New York’s White Material label, DJ Richard’s debut album strikes a balance between house and techno: analog in feel, melancholy in mood, and rough around the edges, yet still unmistakably elegant. More than his previous singles, <i>Grind</i> serves as a bridge between European and American styles, perhaps as a result of his relocation to Berlin. Its patient, four-to-the-floor rhythms, consonant tones, and twinkling details are of a piece with German producers (and Dial regulars) like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7523-lawrence/"">Lawrence</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10842-roman-flugel/"">Roman Flügel</a>, and the wistful shimmer of ""I-Mir"" and ""Vampire Dub"" echoes Kompakt’s resident sentimentalist, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4074-superpitcher/"">Superpitcher</a>. But his unvarnished drum machines and torn-up textures have more in common with the brawnier approach favored by scrappy domestic crews like L.I.E.S., while his crisply jacking grooves go straight to the Midwestern root.</p>
<p>Far more than a formal exercise, though, the album is as expressive as techno gets, tracing a path from sullen mood pieces to bittersweet melodies to something that feels cathartic. It was recorded after two years spent living in landlocked Berlin, which might explain the vaguely coastal theme that surfaces in titles like ""Savage Coast"", ""Waiting for the Green Flash"", and ""I-Mir"" (the latter two are references to an <a href=""http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/gf2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">atmospheric optical illusion</a> occasionally seen at sunset). Above all, <i>Grind</i> comes across as a meditation on homesickness and distance; that’s particularly true of the album’s bleakest tracks, which are rooted in coldwave and dark ambient.</p>
<p>The album opens with a lowing foghorn dirge that brings to mind the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jFmwI_LCAQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bilious drones </a>of Christoph de Babalon’s 1997 album <i>If You’re Into It, I’m Out of It</i>. It's one of several beatless, atmospheric tracks that help set the album's pensive tone: ""Waiting for the Green Flash"" sounds like a pitched-down approximation of the beatless closing minutes of Sonic Youth's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP4I_kHmC-Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Expressway to Yr Skull""</a>, all brooding bell tones and trembling harmonics, while the monolithic ""Ejected"" sounds like a synth player's tribute to microtonal minimalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/816-tony-conrad/"">Tony Conrad </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/816-tony-conrad/"">Phill Niblock</a>. At first blush, these tracks might seem static, but turn them up loud enough and zero in on the shifting contours of their frequencies, and they truly come alive.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b5463fd1-b7ab-9057-7524-52a40e7ab2a6""><span>His beat-oriented work benefits from the same richness and subtlety. ""Nighthawk"", ""Savage Coast"", and ""Bane"", in particular, are examples of how to sculpt and layer relatively simple analog sounds so that they really sing. Richard's taste in synthesizers leans towards soft pads that beg you to sink into them, and he has a knack for contrasting those airy patches with tough, cutting drum hits that leave welts where they land. On ""Nighthawk"", a stretched and sandpapered wail in the background is both harsh and enveloping—a tactic that goes to the heart of the producer's keen sense of balance. He favors stuttering drum programming that suggests a mechanical kind of funk, and he is skilled at arranging contrapuntal lines into complicated but elegant orbits. Despite the outward simplicity of his productions, there's always something to tip their intensity levels subtly into the red. On ""Screes of Gray Craig"", it's the slight detuning of three or four separate synthesizer parts, so that they vibrate wildly in combination. And in the closing ""Vampire Dub"", a relaxing cut suffused in dreamy chords, it's the eerie, atonal bleating that burbles on like cosmic background radiation. Still, even at their most roiled, </span><i>Grind</i><span>'s waters invite extended immersion. It's both one of the year's most sumptuous techno long-players and a masterful example of an unusual, bare-knuckled strain of ambient music.</span></span></p></div>"|20878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20878-grind/|8.1|Philip Sherburne

The group, who grew out of the late '70s Glasgow punk scene paired brightly-colored, synth-driven new wave melodies with lyrics that often spoke of sadness and loss. That polarity between light and darkness became even more apparent in the group’s acrimonious dissolution in 1986, just five years after they started. MacDowall had always nursed an interest in the occult, but over the course of the duo's brief run, it deepened, moving beyond a childlike fascination with fairies into the realm of straight-up black magic (in one <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/14/cult-heroes-strawberry-switchblade-the-clue-was-in-the-name"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">oft-repeated story</a>, she was so furious with a bad note during the recording of ""Let Her Go"", she allegedly stared at the tape machine and willed it to burst into flames). Her curiosity only intensified after she and her husband fell in with Genesis P-Orridge, which led to even darker pursuits—in <a href=""http://www.strawberryswitchblade.net/interviews/bysubject_27.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an extensive interview</a>, Bryson claims McDowall developed an obsession with Nazi history, going so far as to hang a Nazi flag in her apartment. While McDowall <a href=""http://www.strawberryswitchblade.net/interviews/bysubject_28.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">emphatically denies</a> the claim, her collaborations with suspect artists like Boyd Rice and Death in June in the intervening years seem unwise at best.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Fortunately, none of these matters surface on <i>Cut With the Cake Knife</i>, which McDowall recorded in various locations around the UK in the 1980s, shortly after Strawberry Switchblade’s breakup. Instead, the album’s 11 songs follow the same blueprint that made McDowall’s previous group so bewitching, pairing bleak—and, at times, violent—lyrics to the kind of sugary music that might soundtrack a particularly rambunctious children’s show. Drum machines whirr and rattle, keyboards blink like buggy Lite Brites, and McDowall’s somber alto winds its way through the center like a serpent cutting a path through cellophane Easter grass. On the opening track ""Tibet"", she seems to be wrestling with Strawberry Switchblade’s breakup, sighing ""I don’t want you to go/ But can’t ask you to stay/ I wish I could change your mind/ But wishes sometimes die."" The music that surrounds it is a kind of ersatz calypso, with charmingly chintzy rhythms and gurgling keyboards, but the vocal melody is so assured and clear-eyed that the song never feels cloying or saccharine. ""Sixty Cowboys"" dabbles in the kind of synthetic country that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2643-the-magnetic-fields/"">the Magnetic Fields</a> would master on <i>Charm of the Highway Strip</i>, with brittle keyboards filling in for banjos and McDowall’s lonesome voice floating upward like campfire smoke. And while the title ""Crystal Nights"" takes on an ominous meaning in light of the allegations about McDowall’s hobbies, the song itself harbors no questionable subject matter. Instead, it depicts her in bed daydreaming about her lover as keyboards spiral like fireflies around her.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-27e15379-b27e-526f-1f81-a489583188ba""><span>While its ingredients are undeniably basic—all of the songs are built from a few period-appropriate keyboards and chugging drum machines, and that’s mostly it—what makes </span><i>Cake Knife</i><span> so consistently endearing is how </span><span>effortless</span><span> it all sounds. That the only bum note is a chirpy cover of ""Don’t Fear the Reaper"", which comes off like the theme music to an old Commodore 64 game, speaks to how strong the rest of the record is. On </span><i>Cake Knife</i><span>, McDowall has created a kind of aural </span><span>Candy Land</span><span>, one where she can break off vanilla bark from Jujyfruit trees while she sings about death and despair. The title track—which was originally intended to be a Strawberry Switchblade song—takes that m.o. to its logical extreme. While a comically cartoonish bass and hyperactive synths jitter and pop around her, McDowall beckons a lover closer before announcing in its deliriously euphoric chorus, ""I will take you by the hand and lead you/ To my sunny side and I will/ Cut you with the cake knife/ Right between the eyes."" In McDowall’s world, cake and chaos go hand in hand. She’s the witch at the door of the gingerbread house, beckoning you inside.</span></span></p></div>"|20912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20912-cut-with-the-cake-knife/|7.7|J. Edward Keyes

""Slowed some music down and called myself an artist."" The lyric is a recognizable jab at the musician’s own past, a career built on choppy dance remixes of pop songs labeled as ""experimental"" or ""vaporwave,"" collected and stacked up like bricks in a well-supported corner of Bandcamp.</p>
<p>But now DeRobertis has made moves to ground himself. He signed to <a href=""http://carparkrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carpark Records</a>, ditched his previous corporation-provoking moniker, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31982-saint-pepsi/"">Saint Pepsi</a>, and started singing himself instead of simply <a href=""https://saintpepsi.bandcamp.com/track/carly-rae-jepsen-call-me-maybe-saint-pepsi-edit"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remixing others</a> voices. While ""Can’t You See"" is directed at grabbing the attention of a girl, as DeRobertis’ first statement on the record it's pointed just as much at his fans. And <i>Prom King</i> is his slickest project to date, brimming with as much confidence as its title suggests. This is dance music that’s almost a late-'00s throwback, with the record’s synth arrangements and affinity for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29394-chic/"">Chic</a> basslines more in line with the early music of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28404-miami-horror/"">Miami Horror</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"">Neon Indian</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5730-cut-copy/"">Cut Copy</a> than what clubs are playing now. No bass drops, no house revival, no costumed persona; this is highly warped nu-disco that’s frantically aggressive in its pacing and composition.</p>
<p><i>Prom King</i> vibrates at all times with hyperactivity. On songs like ""Cash Wednesday"" and ""Bounce Is Back"" it sounds like someone restlessly flipping between radio stations, with violins, new wave synths, and fluttery sampled R&amp;B vocals rolling into one another. ""My album is sort of about the narcissism that comes with nostalgia,"" DeRobertis <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/saint-pepsi-fiona-coyne/#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said in an interview</a>. ""You have to have some sort of audacity to claim a certain time as ‘the best’ and throw out everything in the present and everything in the future.""</p>
<p>In this sense, Skylar Spence isn’t making pop music, but making music <i>about</i> pop. You don’t just hear it in how he mixes his songs, but also in how he writes them. ""Oh darling, won’t you believe me,"" DeRobertis’ sings on the infectiously groovy, ""Degrassi""-referencing ""Fiona Coyne"", first released as a single last year. ""I’ll love you ‘til the record stops."" And every ""I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love"" on ""Can’t You See"" is directed at his own reflection in the mirror.</p>
<p>DeRobertis could plausibly have built an album of could-be radio hits like ""Fiona Coyne"" if he toned down the freakiness of the music beneath him, but that doesn’t seem to be his objective. The spliced-together samples and glitchy collages makes<i> Prom King</i> distinctive, although sometimes it feels over-indulgent. Even with DeRobertis’ distanced, conceptual take on pop nostalgia, he's still made a great pop record in itself. It doesn’t matter what noises or instruments he’s appropriating from, in his hands it’s all good to dance to right now.</p></div>"|20977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20977-prom-king/|7.0|Hazel Cills

The title track of the Kentucky singer-songwriter’s beguiling third album, ""Over and Even"" is a gentle canter. Cymbals splash idly against a steady electric guitar, and a banjo babbles in the distance, as though it soon hopes to join Shelley’s fireside chat. The song itself, though, is an anxious number, where images of domestic bliss disintegrate into feelings of longing. At first, Shelley offers scenes of nesting bliss in her warm contralto—smoldering embers and full cups of coffee, handwritten letters and thoughts of friends. But during every other verse, her voice becomes a thin and nervous soprano, as if she’s barely able to utter her own words. With the song's last words, she admits to an abiding loneliness: ""I miss your scent and sight,"" she sings, her voice about to break. ""How can I write this?""</p>
<p>Shelley weaves that feeling of vulnerability throughout the dozen songs of <i>Over and Even</i>, an album that is alternately more confessional and prismatic than her previous output—and better for it. Shelley comes from an American folk background, with a history singing songs endemic to her rural region. She records, for instance, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9226-age-and-time/4/"" target=""_blank"">Maiden Radio, a trio </a>that works through standards with traditional instruments and commingled country voices. While her earliest solo records spoke to that pedigree, last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19828-joan-shelley-electric-ursa/""><i>Electric Ursa</i></a> took bona fide compositional risks. ""Something Small"", for instance, grew like a post-rock phoenix, while ""Remedios"" suggested a lullaby bound forever in hypnagogia. She embraced elliptical songwriting, too, webbing together evocative phrases to suggest a story more than share it. If <i>Electric Ursa</i> began with a folk core, it ended with folk in fragments.</p>
<p>On <i>Over and Even</i>, however, Shelley returns to her roots without fully retreating beneath them. Accompanied by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9226-age-and-time/4/"" target=""_blank"">fingerstyle guitarist and musical archivist Nathan Salsburg</a>, she favors a refined simplicity. ""My Only Trouble"" is a duet for strummed-and-picked acoustic guitars and her leaping-and-diving voice, while ""Easy Now"" is a big-chord ballad, where reassuring piano lines offer support behind lithe, bluegrass-like runs. Even the more fully produced numbers, like the organ-lined and electric ""Ariadne’s Gone"" or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a>-backed beauty ""Stay on My Shore"", seem only to dress up simple structures, to cast them in a full studio glow.</p>
<p>The lyrics follow suit, too, with Shelley letting listeners in as she previously didn’t—hence, the hint of unease that ends ""Over and Even"". ""My Only Trouble"", for instance, is sensual but bothered, with confessions of intimacy chased by admissions of worry. Likewise, ""Stay on My Shore"" betrays a human neediness that Shelley might have once clouded or cloaked. As Oldham chases her through the verses, their musical push-and-pull reinforces the give-and-take of any good relationship or, as they sing with their last shared breath, ""the pages of our story."" That clear lifetime theme returns during the gentle ""Not Over by Half"". Meant both as a mournful dirge and an anthem of expectations, the song positions a death as a reminder that everyone else still has the chance to live. ""Here on the mountain I’m thinking of you,"" Shelley sings in one of her most vivid bits of writing yet. ""The birds are all singing, screaming of youth."" She keeps the listener almost as close as the subject.</p>
<p>This tension between plain old songs and structures and an interest in omitting details and accessorizing sounds enlivens <i>Over and Even </i>from start to finish. Shelley started with folk and then pushed away from it, to <i>Electric Ursa</i>’s spectral and soft version of roots-rock. But now in the middle, where the songs are direct but bent just so, she’s more compelling than she’s ever been.</p></div>"|20930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20930-over-and-even/|7.8|Grayson Haver Currin

Leading up to its release, he got more press for his loathsomely tone-deaf justifications of ""U.O.E.N.O""'s rape lyric, which<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50291-reebok-drops-rick-ross-due-to-rape-controversy/""> cost him his sponsorship with Reebok</a>, than he was for radio hits. Besides ""Sanctified"", an album cut featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>, little of <i>Mastermind</i> has lingered in the public consciousness. As for <i>Hood Billionaire—</i>the second album Ross released that year—did <i>you</i> recall that existed?</p>
<p>Times are tough for rap supervillains, it seems: even Rick Ross's nemesis <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/"">50 Cent</a> is declaring <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/5GoNBYsLyB/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bankruptcy</a>. And <i>Black Dollar</i>, Ross' first new project in a year, feels slightly recalibrated to reflect the new hard times. A ""grounded"" Rick Ross would be unthinkable, but he <i>has</i> scaled back, mostly on the production, which leaves behind the booming, slow-moving productions of Lex Luger and his many imitators. ""Foreclosed on my past life,"" he bellows on the opening track ""Foreclosures"", an early highlight and the most compelling music he's made since his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/""><i>Rich Forever</i></a> peak. </p>
<p>The song offers the welcome surprise of hearing Ross treat money as something that eats away at relationships and breeds distrust, instead of green rectangles he enjoys tossing out of helicopters. There are not-so-veiled references to contract issues with his own artists: ""That paper get funny when publishing's involved/ Mechanicals never matter, 'cause that was your dog."" Rapping about music-industry arcana like ""mechanicals"" and publishing<b> </b>is not a surefire recipe for excitement, but Ross' sonorous voice still breeds drama. His delivery is so convincing that the man who once air-lifted his mansion from Miami to Boca Raton sounds halfway-believable as a financial advisor: ""I never met an artist who fully recouped/ These the deals the deal dealers wanna deal to you!"" he raps through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>That voice of his, and the way he makes it leap and tremble with joy, can momentarily make you believe anything. At his best, Rick Ross isn't just a fantasy-fulfillment rapper, or a maximalist hitmaker: He's a <i>performer</i>, in the purest sense of that word. On ""We Gon Make It"", his voice climbs in excitement, and the gusto, the control, and thunderous conviction of his performance recalls the promos cut by the greatest WWF wrestlers. There is a trace of <a href=""http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-25-greatest-mic-moments-in-wrestling-history/page-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dusty Rhodes </a>in how he savors pauses, pounces on ripe-sounding words, sometimes at the expense of intelligibility. On ""Turn Ya Back"", he spits every repetition of the word ""back"" like it's a mouthful of poison. ""Money and the Powder"" repurposes the chanted chorus from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3707-scarface/"">Scarface</a>'s classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1naWK2BEas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Money and the Power""</a>, and by the time Ross is done with it, the phrase has melted into simply ""money and the POWWW!""</p>
<p>This energy has always been the electrifying current enlivening even his silliest lyrics—on ""Bill Gates"", he reiterates his dearly held dream of a world with ""Wing Stops on every corner."" It is what allows him to somehow to diss <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Freeway%22_Rick_Ross"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Freeway"" Rick Ross</a>—the very real gangster whose identity Ross co-opted—and 50 Cent in the same bar on ""Geechi Liberace"". There are dull, rote spots on <i>Black Dollar</i>—""Money Dance"" retreats into a soft-focus world of bowties, marble floors,  and cocktail-jazz pianos that is about as exciting as eavesdropping on senior executives. And the reduced ambitions also mean that there are no calling-card songs here, no tarmac-sized beats or immediate chanted hooks. It's clear that Ross is regrouping. But the project serves as a reminder: This a good energy to have around, still.</p></div>"|21025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21025-black-dollar/|7.1|Jayson Greene

""Fight the Power"" provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a> based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">the Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s recent ""i"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i>, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's <b><i>Live at Yankee Stadium</i></b>, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's <b><i>Inside You</i></b> and 1982's <b><i>The Real Deal</i></b>, and the first-ever release anywhere of <b><i>Wild in Woodstock</i></b>, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&amp;B hits but never seeing crossovers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's <b><i>Shout!</i></b>, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: <i>3 + 3</i>, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later <b><i>The Heat Is On</i></b> became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A close listen to <i>The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters </i>underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">With this 1969 hit, along with the <b><i>It's Our Thing</i></b> album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the <i>now</i> of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|8.5|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A close listen to <i>The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters </i>underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">With this 1969 hit, along with the <b><i>It's Our Thing</i></b> album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the <i>now</i> of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|7.0|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">With this 1969 hit, along with the <b><i>It's Our Thing</i></b> album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the <i>now</i> of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|7.7|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

They last cracked the charts in 2006, with ""Just Came Here to Chill"" petering out at 25 on the R&amp;B charts. Few other artists can match that kind of longevity and, fittingly, the band's biggest hits still resonate. ""Shout"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""This Old Heart of Mine"", ""It's Your Thing"", ""That Lady"", and ""Fight the Power"" all arrived during the glory days of Top 40 in the '60s and '70s, enduring hits still heard on oldies radio, movies, television, and commercials. The Isleys also are a bottomless well for samples in hip-hop. ""Fight the Power"" provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a> based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">the Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s recent ""i"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i>, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's <b><i>Live at Yankee Stadium</i></b>, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's <b><i>Inside You</i></b> and 1982's <b><i>The Real Deal</i></b>, and the first-ever release anywhere of <b><i>Wild in Woodstock</i></b>, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&amp;B hits but never seeing crossovers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's <b><i>Shout!</i></b>, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: <i>3 + 3</i>, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later <b><i>The Heat Is On</i></b> became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product.

Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|8.3|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

They last cracked the charts in 2006, with ""Just Came Here to Chill"" petering out at 25 on the R&amp;B charts. Few other artists can match that kind of longevity and, fittingly, the band's biggest hits still resonate. ""Shout"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""This Old Heart of Mine"", ""It's Your Thing"", ""That Lady"", and ""Fight the Power"" all arrived during the glory days of Top 40 in the '60s and '70s, enduring hits still heard on oldies radio, movies, television, and commercials. The Isleys also are a bottomless well for samples in hip-hop. ""Fight the Power"" provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a> based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">the Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s recent ""i"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i>, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's <b><i>Live at Yankee Stadium</i></b>, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's <b><i>Inside You</i></b> and 1982's <b><i>The Real Deal</i></b>, and the first-ever release anywhere of <b><i>Wild in Woodstock</i></b>, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&amp;B hits but never seeing crossovers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's <b><i>Shout!</i></b>, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: <i>3 + 3</i>, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later <b><i>The Heat Is On</i></b> became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A close listen to <i>The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters </i>underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>

Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|8.9|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

They last cracked the charts in 2006, with ""Just Came Here to Chill"" petering out at 25 on the R&amp;B charts. Few other artists can match that kind of longevity and, fittingly, the band's biggest hits still resonate. ""Shout"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""This Old Heart of Mine"", ""It's Your Thing"", ""That Lady"", and ""Fight the Power"" all arrived during the glory days of Top 40 in the '60s and '70s, enduring hits still heard on oldies radio, movies, television, and commercials. The Isleys also are a bottomless well for samples in hip-hop. ""Fight the Power"" provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a> based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">the Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s recent ""i"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i>, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's <b><i>Live at Yankee Stadium</i></b>, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's <b><i>Inside You</i></b> and 1982's <b><i>The Real Deal</i></b>, and the first-ever release anywhere of <b><i>Wild in Woodstock</i></b>, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&amp;B hits but never seeing crossovers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's <b><i>Shout!</i></b>, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: <i>3 + 3</i>, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later <b><i>The Heat Is On</i></b> became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A close listen to <i>The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters </i>underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">With this 1969 hit, along with the <b><i>It's Our Thing</i></b> album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the <i>now</i> of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n.

They last cracked the charts in 2006, with ""Just Came Here to Chill"" petering out at 25 on the R&amp;B charts. Few other artists can match that kind of longevity and, fittingly, the band's biggest hits still resonate. ""Shout"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""This Old Heart of Mine"", ""It's Your Thing"", ""That Lady"", and ""Fight the Power"" all arrived during the glory days of Top 40 in the '60s and '70s, enduring hits still heard on oldies radio, movies, television, and commercials. The Isleys also are a bottomless well for samples in hip-hop. ""Fight the Power"" provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a> based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">the Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s recent ""i"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i>, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's <b><i>Live at Yankee Stadium</i></b>, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's <b><i>Inside You</i></b> and 1982's <b><i>The Real Deal</i></b>, and the first-ever release anywhere of <b><i>Wild in Woodstock</i></b>, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&amp;B hits but never seeing crossovers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's <b><i>Shout!</i></b>, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: <i>3 + 3</i>, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later <b><i>The Heat Is On</i></b> became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A close listen to <i>The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters </i>underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">With this 1969 hit, along with the <b><i>It's Our Thing</i></b> album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the <i>now</i> of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection.

""Fight the Power"" provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a> based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">the Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s recent ""i"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i>, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's <b><i>Live at Yankee Stadium</i></b>, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's <b><i>Inside You</i></b> and 1982's <b><i>The Real Deal</i></b>, and the first-ever release anywhere of <b><i>Wild in Woodstock</i></b>, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&amp;B hits but never seeing crossovers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's <b><i>Shout!</i></b>, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: <i>3 + 3</i>, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later <b><i>The Heat Is On</i></b> became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A close listen to <i>The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters </i>underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">With this 1969 hit, along with the <b><i>It's Our Thing</i></b> album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the <i>now</i> of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|9.0|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A close listen to <i>The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters </i>underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">With this 1969 hit, along with the <b><i>It's Our Thing</i></b> album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the <i>now</i> of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|7.4|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">With this 1969 hit, along with the <b><i>It's Our Thing</i></b> album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the <i>now</i> of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|6.4|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

They last cracked the charts in 2006, with ""Just Came Here to Chill"" petering out at 25 on the R&amp;B charts. Few other artists can match that kind of longevity and, fittingly, the band's biggest hits still resonate. ""Shout"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""This Old Heart of Mine"", ""It's Your Thing"", ""That Lady"", and ""Fight the Power"" all arrived during the glory days of Top 40 in the '60s and '70s, enduring hits still heard on oldies radio, movies, television, and commercials. The Isleys also are a bottomless well for samples in hip-hop. ""Fight the Power"" provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a> based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">the Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s recent ""i"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i>, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's <b><i>Live at Yankee Stadium</i></b>, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's <b><i>Inside You</i></b> and 1982's <b><i>The Real Deal</i></b>, and the first-ever release anywhere of <b><i>Wild in Woodstock</i></b>, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&amp;B hits but never seeing crossovers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's <b><i>Shout!</i></b>, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: <i>3 + 3</i>, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later <b><i>The Heat Is On</i></b> became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product.

Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|5.4|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

They last cracked the charts in 2006, with ""Just Came Here to Chill"" petering out at 25 on the R&amp;B charts. Few other artists can match that kind of longevity and, fittingly, the band's biggest hits still resonate. ""Shout"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""This Old Heart of Mine"", ""It's Your Thing"", ""That Lady"", and ""Fight the Power"" all arrived during the glory days of Top 40 in the '60s and '70s, enduring hits still heard on oldies radio, movies, television, and commercials. The Isleys also are a bottomless well for samples in hip-hop. ""Fight the Power"" provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a> based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">the Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s recent ""i"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i>, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's <b><i>Live at Yankee Stadium</i></b>, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's <b><i>Inside You</i></b> and 1982's <b><i>The Real Deal</i></b>, and the first-ever release anywhere of <b><i>Wild in Woodstock</i></b>, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&amp;B hits but never seeing crossovers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's <b><i>Shout!</i></b>, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: <i>3 + 3</i>, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later <b><i>The Heat Is On</i></b> became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A close listen to <i>The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters </i>underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>

Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic. Retroactively, these records do have a crossover appeal, due in no small part to their lasting legacy within the R&amp;B demographic, a legacy echoed through samples that underpinned crossover hip-hop hits of the '90s. After <i>Showdown</i>, however, the last run of Isley records on T-Neck—1979's <b><i>Winner Takes All</i></b>, 1980's <i>Go All the Way</i>, 1981's <b><i>Grand Slam</i></b> and <b><i>Inside You</i></b>, 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i>, 1983's <i>Between the Sheets</i>—are records divided between smooth quiet storm and cloistered disco fallout, records that substitute adventure for calculation. By most measures, these albums aren't as strong as what came before, particularly the hot streak of the mid-'70s, but when listened to in succession, they're not drastic disappointments; they underscore the fleet-footedness of the Isley Brothers, how they followed fashion and wound up reflecting their times. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This eager elasticity is why Eric Weisbard uses the Isley Brothers as his R&amp;B case study in his revelatory book <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9550-top-40-democracy/""><i>Top 40 Democracy: The Rival Mainstreams of American Music</i></a>. Weisbard argues that the Isleys were crowd-pleasing showmen from the start, a group keenly aware that a broader appeal meant steady work, so they were happy to go wherever their audience went, no matter what sound took them there. Through its sheer variety, <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i> does provide supporting evidence for this thesis but the wonderful thing about the box is how the Isley Brothers never sound crass or mercenary as they hop from church-inflected R&amp;B to funk to quiet storm. The Isley Brothers never abandoned their identity as they rolled with the changes, finding sly ways to make fads seem like divine inspiration. If they never did manage to deliver an outright classic album—<i>3 + 3</i> and <i>The Heat Is On</i> come very, very close—this box suggests using this metric as a yardstick for measuring greatness is a fallacy. What the Isley Brothers achieved can't be contained in a single album nor can it be adequately summarized in a hits collection. They seized all the tumult, all the excitement, all of the sounds of their time and turned it into enduring commercial art whose endurance and depth is best appreciated in a set like this, where the actual records can be heard in their entirety. </p></div>"|20989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20989-the-isley-brothers-the-rca-victor-and-t-neck-album-masters/|5.7|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

They last cracked the charts in 2006, with ""Just Came Here to Chill"" petering out at 25 on the R&amp;B charts. Few other artists can match that kind of longevity and, fittingly, the band's biggest hits still resonate. ""Shout"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""This Old Heart of Mine"", ""It's Your Thing"", ""That Lady"", and ""Fight the Power"" all arrived during the glory days of Top 40 in the '60s and '70s, enduring hits still heard on oldies radio, movies, television, and commercials. The Isleys also are a bottomless well for samples in hip-hop. ""Fight the Power"" provided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> with the title and some beats for their defining 1989 protest anthem, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a> based ""It Was a Good Day"" on ""Footsteps in the Dark"", ""Between the Sheets"" provided the bed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">the Notorious B.I.G.</a>'s ""Big Poppa"", ""That Lady"" invigorated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" and can be heard in <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s recent ""i"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kendrick's sample illustrates how the Isley Brothers remain close to the surface of modern culture, so perhaps the time is ripe for <i>The RCA Victor &amp; T-Neck Album Masters</i>, a brick of a box containing 21 albums, nearly all expanded with single mixes and other assorted rarities (it also represents the first CD release of 1969's <b><i>Live at Yankee Stadium</i></b>, the U.S. digital debut of 1981's <b><i>Inside You</i></b> and 1982's <b><i>The Real Deal</i></b>, and the first-ever release anywhere of <b><i>Wild in Woodstock</i></b>, a good live-in-the-studio record cut in 1980). As hefty as this is, it doesn't have all the recordings they ever made, not by a long shot: everything they did for United Artists (where they recorded ""Twist and Shout"") or Motown (where they struck gold with ""This Old Heart of Mine"") is absent, as is anything from the 20-plus years they spent hopping between Warner, Island, and DreamWorks, racking up sizeable R&amp;B hits but never seeing crossovers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, the RCA designation is a bit of a misnomer, as the only record the group recorded there was 1959's <b><i>Shout!</i></b>, so this winds up being a deep dive on the Isleys' work for T-Neck, the independent label they launched in 1964. About a decade later, the Isleys signed a distribution deal with an Epic Records run by Clive Davis and that's when their career hit its stride: <i>3 + 3</i>, their first album on Epic, reached #8 thanks to ""That Lady"", and two years later <b><i>The Heat Is On</i></b> became their first #1 on the back of its single ""Fight the Power"". The Isleys stayed in the pop Top 10 until 1980's <b><i>Go All the Way</i></b> and racked up platinum albums until 1983's <b><i>Between the Sheets</i></b>, after which the band's classic lineup splintered and the group left Epic, selling the label the rights to T-Neck as a way to get out of a financial jam.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite this prolonged success—and even when they hit a rough patch in the early '80s, they bounced back on the R&amp;B charts within a couple of years—the Isley Brothers never have been considered album artists, not in the way such peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> were. They never had an album place on <i>Village Voice</i>'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, they never make All-Time Greatest Albums lists; they're seen as a perennial singles act, responsible for some of the greatest 45s of the 20th century but never tying it all together into a grand artistic statement—a sentiment, if true, would make this 23-disc set a slog. It's not. It's absorbing, due to the Isley Brothers' ability to shift with the fashions, their dogged work ethic and embrace of recorded music as commercial product. At their peak, they delivered hot funk and smooth soul every year without fail—sometimes splitting an album in two so there was a fast side and a slow side—and there is something to be said for that regularity: when you laid down your money, you knew the Isleys would deliver the goods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A close listen to <i>The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters </i>underscores how the Isley Brothers may have been reliable but they were never static. They were keenly aware of emerging trends—shamelessly exclaiming ""It's a Disco Night"" in 1979 but threading in hot analog synths á la Rick James on 1982's <i>The Real Deal</i> as they slowly drifted into a quiet storm—and listening to these albums back-to-back underscores progression, not complacency. The presence of the outlier of 1959's <i>Shout!</i> emphasizes just how far the group travelled. Here, the group—just a trio of Ronnie, O'Kelly, and Rudolph Isley—slipped exuberant R&amp;B in between blues and Tin Pan Alley standards, the kind of tunes acceptable to the supper club audiences that constituted a pop crossover in the late '50s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This was standard practice in 1959 because kids didn't buy long-players, adults did, yet this divide between respectable material and rip-roaring rockers like their original ""Respectable"" gives <i>Shout!</i> a slight musty air. The Isleys traded the standards for the twist while at United Artists in the early '60s, a swap that emphasized their youth but still carried traces of stiffness due to UA and the Isleys chasing dance crazes. Like so many artists, the Isley Brothers learned how to cannily blend their commercial aspirations with pure soul while at Motown, a pivotal moment missing on this big box. Instead, this set has their fledgling mid-'60s singles for their own T-Neck, 45s heard on the compilation <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>. Released in 1971—the date explains why Jimi Hendrix, the trio's guitarist in 1964 and 1965, looms over the band itself on the cover art—<i>In the Beginning</i> crackles with the rumblings of the intense grit of funk, goosed along by Jimi's proto-psychedelic guitar, music that points the way toward T-Neck Isley Brothers more than Motown's <i>This Old Heart of Mine</i>. Ernie Isley picked up the thread Hendrix lay hanging, but before Ernie turned into a guitar hero in his own right came ""It's Your Thing,"" a wild, loose-limbed groove that functioned as the Isleys' repudiation of Motown and embrace of Sly and the Family Stone funk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">With this 1969 hit, along with the <b><i>It's Our Thing</i></b> album that accompanied it, the Isley Brothers embraced the <i>now</i> of '60s soul. The album was very much their thing: they threw in everything they had in reviving their indie T-Neck, abandoning the uptown soul without losing sight of a pop audience while also deepening the groove, all giving them their biggest hit to date. Maintaining momentum proved tricky, especially when their socially conscious, Black Power-fueled records (1969's <b><i>The Brothers: Isley</i></b>, 1970's <b><i>Get Into Something</i></b>) didn't catch a spark, so the group caught the rays of the hippie sunset in the early '70s, scoring a genuine hit with Stephen Stills' ""Love the One You're With"", the cornerstone of a covers-laden '71 LP <b><i>Givin' It Back</i></b>, where Ronald, Ernie, and Marvin all posed like Earth-minded singer/songwriters on its burnished cover. <i>Givin' It Back</i> coincided with the rise of album-oriented radio and, as there was now an audience consuming albums as albums, the Isleys began structuring their long-players as immersive experiences. A flirtation with Philly Soul followed in 1972—<b><i>Brother, Brother, Brother</i></b> bore a huge hit with ""Work to Do"", but it's an anomaly on a record where the second side contains just two songs, one of which is a 10-minute workout on Carole King's ""It's Too Late""—and then came the <i>3 + 3</i> makeover, when the trio doubled the size of their lineup and found funk.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>3 + 3</i> is the breakthrough, the album where the bespangled bell-bottomed soul renegades of the '70s were unveiled—not coincidentally, it's the first released on Epic—but it's a record where the fizzy ""That Lady"" sits next to a cover of James Taylor and the Isleys find a way to bring soul to Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine (Go Away Today)"" and Seals &amp; Crofts' ""Summer Breeze"", two of the most sensitive of the '70s SoCal soft sounds. More than anything, this illustrates how the Isleys' phases overlapped: they found their groove thing but weren't quite ready to leave covers behind, not when those covers were successful and broadened the audience. They needed the security of one other hit—1974's <b><i>Live It Up</i></b>, whose title track went to four R&amp;B while a cover of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a> ballad sat on its second side—before they cut their first album of all originals, 1975's <i>The Heat Is O</i>n. With its ""Fight the Power""—an anthem of defiance that seemed more political than its lyrics actually were; it was a rebellion that jumped demographics—they had their biggest-ever crossover hit and it's one firmly grounded in funk: its attitude and melody hooked in a larger audience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Heat Is On</i> proved to be the apex of the Isley Brothers' chart success, at least as far as the crossover pop audience was concerned. Hit albums still followed—1976's <b><i>Harvest for the World</i></b>, 1977's <b><i>Go for Your</i><i> Guns</i></b>, and 1978's <b><i>Showdown</i></b> all went platinum or better, all accompanied by major R&amp;B hits—but the Isley Brothers were now firmly an R&amp;B act, one who were still stars but stars for a specific demographic.

But first, ""Ain’t It Sweet"" spends a full minute stretching out: A steady guitar chug beckons a Wurlitzer’s gap-tooth whistle; low fiddle dips around skittish piano notes, before everything whips to a gentle crest. Only then do Cook, his brother and </span><a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/admin/albumreviews/albumreview/20964/pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/""><span>Megafaun</span></a><span> bandmate Brad, and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5976-justin-vernon/""><span>Justin Vernon</span></a><span> blast the title, exalting like sunflowers at dawn—or a rural bar band toasting a lock-in. The sweetness is Cook’s comfort in knowing that, ultimately, he and his wife will lie together in the ground. He’s not singing about heaven, but turns the gothic foreboding of death-do-us-part into radiant, secular gospel: ""Well we’re wide awake then we’re dead and gone/ But we find a way just to carry on.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That’s the stuff, right there—not that carrying on is as simple as just saying so; Cook spends much of </span><i>Southland Mission</i><span> attempting to find the way, just as the path to this he record was its own calling. ""It had to come out of me,"" he has </span><a href=""http://www.thebluegrasssituation.com/read/language-music-interview-phil-cook"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>said</span></a><span>. ""I didn’t realize it had to come out of me, but it had to."" A decade ago, Cook moved his family from Wisconsin—where he was a member of Bon Iver’s orbit—to North Carolina, lured by the music of the Delta, Bayou, and Appalachia. He played gorgeous, doleful folk rock in Megafaun, complemented the cohorts of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30501-matthew-e-white/""><span>Matthew E. White </span></a><span>and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30386-hiss-golden-messenger/""><span>Hiss Golden Messenger</span></a><span>, acted as bandleader for the Blind Boys of Alabama, and produced for Indigo Girls’ Amy Ray. In 2011 he released </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15442-hungry-mother-blues/"">Hungry Mother Blues</a></i><span>, a low-key solo instrumental record that chased Ry Cooder and John Fahey. </span><i>Southland Mission</i><span> is a more full-bodied commitment. <span style=""color: #222222; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 24px; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"">Whether simple banjo fare, outlaw stompers, or reeling strut, each one of Cook’s modes is an easy and infectious exertion. And </span>like any good missionary, Cook’s fervor is infectious.</span></p>
<p>Although <i>Southland Mission</i> is studiously steeped in tradition, it wears it lightly. Recorded in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the warmth of the Durham, N.C. community behind the record (the likes of Matt McCaughan, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28236-mountain-man/"">Mountain Man</a>’s Amelia Meath) beams through as its own kind of congregation, though there’s occasionally a homespun gospel duo here, too, in the golden tones of Sophie Blak and Jeanne Jolly. They’re crucial to the record’s two-part centerpiece: chastising Cook for procrastinating on ""Sitting on a Fence Too Long"" before coming to ""Lowly Road"", a bluesy spiritual reckoning, which ends with a call-and-response as the duo welcome him home. Like Hiss Golden Messenger’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19681-hiss-golden-messenger-lateness-of-dancers/""><i>Lateness of Dancers</i></a>, <i>Southland Mission</i> handles doubt with the possibility of redemption, reinforced by the record’s persistent, joyous uplift.</p>
<p>Cook navigates the extremes of the squeezed middle class on <i>Southland Mission</i>, staring down what it looks like to fight or flee. ""1922"" is a cover of a Charlie Parr song about the Piedmont musician’s parents’ Depression-era experiences, where ""ain’t it sweet"" becomes ""ain’t that the way it is."" Fed up of giving all his money to the government, a boy leaves his dead end job, gets beat up in a new town, and, dead broke, has no choice but to go back home: ""Times are hard here and I can’t roam/ But I ain’t got nothing more."" Every verse ends with Cook addressing some ""boys,"" like it’s a tale of bar stool bravado, though choice is never treated as an act of heroism on <i>Southland Mission</i>. ""Nothing sacred, nothing saved/ Get your ass on the morning train or get the hell out the way,"" he sings on ""Great Tide"", an empathetic epic that swings between tender moments and brisk, reeling jubilation.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-9cd74f80-b8c2-f3fe-bfd8-6a6b0630c139""><span>Ultimately, choosing to stay and stoke life’s intimacies wins out over fleeing. ""Anybody Else"", a duet with </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29027-frazey-ford/""><span>Frazey Ford</span></a><span>, sees Cook resisting easy reassurances in favor of a deep and nourishing love. ""Gone"" is a parable about how you might as well give it all you’ve got when you can’t take anything with you. To have is not necessarily to hold, and when possession is transient, belonging is all you have. </span><i>Southland Mission</i><span> lights up tradition with rare and overt joy and palpable gratitude. It’s an open invitation from a man who’s found home. Say yes.</span></span></p></div>"|20964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20964-southland-mission/|7.8|Laura Snapes

Though it seemed crazy at the time, it actually wasn’t the world’s most unusual pairing—both bands had at one point shared a label and each made pop punk songs that were equal parts snotty and catchy—but Pansy Division were an overtly and aggressively gay band with a cult following, while Green Day were riding high on their mainstream major label breakthrough. Even though Green Day's audience seemed flummoxed by Pansy Division—I remember people around me asking <i>‘Are they serious?’</i>—the fact that it was happening <i>at all</i> felt pretty revolutionary. Indie rock was still mostly the unwelcoming domain of straight white dudes. With the occasional exception of seeing Pansy Division, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Is_My_Co-Pilot_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">God Is My Co-Pilot</a>, or the mighty <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Dresch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Team Dresch</a>, being an openly queer person at a mainstream rock show still felt like an open invitation to getting your ass kicked.</p>
<p>It’s hard not to think about Pansy Division when listening to PWR BTTM—the gloriously queer garage punk duo of guitarist Ben Hopkins and drummer Liv Bruce. Formed after the two met at Bard College in upstate New York, queer-identified PWR BTTM make very loud and occasionally very messy music without ever adopting some kind of faux masculine posturing. In fact, that band pretty much eviscerates said posturing with their live sets, in which the two loudly rip through their arsenal of pop-punk missives while flaunting a very rudimentary kind of drag—thrifted dresses, globs of glitter, and kabuki smears of makeup. What saves the whole enterprise from just being a well-played bit of cultural commentary is PWR BTTM's music—they write really catchy songs and they play the shit out of them.</p>
<p>The eleven tracks on <i>Ugly Cherries</i>, PWR BTTM’s full-length debut, mostly vacillate between two-minute rave-ups about boys (""I Wanna Boi"", ""All the Boys"") and two-minute ruminations on the lack thereof (""West Texas"", ""C U Around""). On ""I Wanna Boi"" Bruce recites a list of needs for potential partners (""I want a boy who thinks it’s sexy when my lipstick bleeds/ I want a boy who can go all night without stopping/ I want a boy knows exactly what he needs"") against a stomping guitar/drum track that wouldn’t sound out of place on an early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">White Stripes</a> record. He even goes as far as to share his email address just in case any qualified applicants want to get in touch. The song, like much of the rest of <i>Ugly Cherries</i>, is certainly funny, but it isn’t a joke.</p>
<p>In fact, the record is hearteningly earnest. The band’s best songs are about articulating the goofy, anything-goes joy of being young and open, quite literally, to anything. And while the basic guitar/drum setup doesn’t allow for much subtlety, Hopkins and Bruce manage to wring impressively dynamic tunes out of the most basic power riffing. ""We can do our makeup in the parking lot/ We can get so famous that we both get shot,"" Bruce sings on ""Dairy Queen"" as the song morphs into a loud/quiet/LOUD jam. On ""1994""—a track that, not coincidentally, sounds like it could have been recorded in 1994—Hopkins sings that ""These days it pays to be so strange and I’m like nothing"" before the song cracks open into a series of falsetto’d ""ooohs,"" handclaps, and arena-size guitar shreds.</p>
<p>And though it all seems simple and sweet enough at first, <i>Ugly Cherries’</i> real strength lies in the way it addresses the fears and foibles of the young and queer-identified, both for better and for worse. While the glee expressed on the record feels like a middle finger aimed directly at the hetero establishment, there is an endearing vulnerability at work as well—an understanding that the world is not always your friend. On ""Serving Goffman"" the duo celebrate the merits of being unafraid to make a fool of oneself in the name of making art and finding love, while acknowledging that it comes at a cost. ""I held my breath in a suit and a tie because I didn’t know I could fight back,"" sings Bruce, ""I wanna put the whole world in drag but I’m starting to realize it’s already like that."" Elsewhere he notes that ""I found out people aren’t that mean but it still feels like they're laughing at me/ When they're just saying hello."" The world has certainly changed, but there is still always a price to be paid for simply being yourself.  Their songs aren’t just a prolonged wink and a nod, but rather complicated statements on what it means to be young and queer and confused and somehow othered.</p>
<p>""Why are you so handsome, gaymazing, and nice?"" asks Hopkins of a lover on the record’s closing track. It’s the kind of question that might have been impossible to ask in a non-ironic way back in 1994 and it’s exactly the kind of thing that makes <i>Ugly Cherries</i> such a special listen. The record is not only catchy as all hell, but it’s also sweet and openhearted and not one bit cynical.

On the jokily earnest, chillaxed last few strummed seconds of ""Punks"", the second track from their sophomore LP <i>Too</i>, frontman Zac Carper muses, ""Relationships are fucking wack/ They make me want to smoke crack/ And girlfriend or boyfriend can suck my dick/ Masturbate, let's make it quick."" It's a perfect encapsulation of FIDLAR's outlook (the band name is an acronym for Fuck It, Dog, Life's A Risk), one that they already cemented on their enjoyably party-hardy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17559-fidlar/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, a hormonal love letter to getting fucked up and fucking up. And while a title like <i>Too</i> might lead you to believe that FIDLAR are wisely committed to not fixing what isn't broke— there are more scuzzy guitars and songs about bad medicine, bad habits, and stupid decisions (all of which happen to be song titles)— it seems to have bigger things in mind for itself.</p>
<p>FIDLAR were initially met with the obvious-but-apt comparison to kindred West Coast spirits <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Wavves</a>, and <i>Too</i> seems to greatly admire Nathan Williams' transition from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12783-wavvves/"" target=""_blank"">disaffected skate rat</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14415-king-of-the-beach/"" target=""_blank"">pop-punk Beach King</a>. It's a crisper, almost radio-friendly effort that's feels slightly jarring in comparison to <i>FIDLAR</i>. Part of this shift can be chalked up to the fact that in the past two years, FIDLAR have made a concerted effort to clean up, as Carper has since kicked everything from heroin to booze after a band intervention. The result is a more levelheaded FIDLAR, an incarnation that likely won't scare away too many fans as it aims to convert new ones. Gone is the feral scrap and the forays into sunburnt surfabilly, replaced by a more MTVU-friendly approach that only feels ""grown-up"" in the sense that it's graduated from 40s in the high-school parking lot to Smirnoff in the frat house basement.</p>
<p>It's too bad <i>Too</i> doesn't boast more numbers like highlight ""West Coast"", a song about getting wasted on the road. But FIDLAR aim a little lower, offering dated-sounding blues stompers (""Punks""),  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Black Lips</a>-lite junkie laments (""Overdose""), interminably bratty nose-thumbing (""Sober""), questionable arena rock (""Bad Habits"") and a weird little detour into the British Invasion (""Why Generation"", which is hopefully supposed to be taken as tongue-in-cheek). The hooks feel forced this time, a byproduct of their desire for a broader audience that dilute the essence of what made them appealing to begin with.</p>
<p>But it's undeniable that <i>Too</i> comes from a good place. Most of the record revolves around Carper's road to sobriety, and the many inherent pitfalls and setbacks faced along the way. ""I figured out when I got sober that life just sucks when you get older,"" he sings on ""Sober"", and it's a brief but affecting peek inside the head of a guy on the other side of addiction and staring down his thirties. A song like ""Leave Me Alone"" carries more weight when you realize it's about Carper's intervention, but too often, the songs break down into digestible little nuggets of stoner wisdom. So while <i>Too</i> is at times brave, that doesn't necessarily make it compelling.</p></div>"|21063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21063-fidlar-too/|5.8|Zach Kelly

Though he's fallen off since the 1980s—who, in his shoes, wouldn't?—it's this artist's strange and frequent urge to over-promise that helps keep everyone harping on <i>Sign 'O' the Times</i> as his apogee. Yet here we are again. An album title like <i>HITNRUN Phase One</i> promises a fair amount, not least the possibility of a concept worth serializing. And that's before the album is announced by its creators as being <a href=""http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/31/prince-interview-hitnrun"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""experimental""</a> in construction. Though after stripping away the promotional language from this streaming-only platter, exclusive to Jay Z's Tidal service (for now), one finds something far less earth-shaking: a casual, slightly-weirder-than-usual release with one very good R&amp;B song (that's reportedly been kicking around in his vault for a while), stranded in the album's penultimate slot.</p>
<p>To get to that very good song—at least in the manner that Prince and his young co-composer, producer, and mixer Joshua Welton intend—you'll plug through a half-hour sequence that contains a throwaway intro, a trio of putative party-starters cluttered with the confetti of modern-dancefloor production-debris, two reworked (as opposed to improved) songs from 2014's superior <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19900-prince-3rdeyegirl-art-official-ageplectrumelectrum/""><i>Art Official Age</i></a>, and a tweaked version of the ""Fallinlove2nite"" standalone single that failed to make that prior album. (Ditching Zooey Deschanel's backing vocals doesn't much elevate that breezy tune's mild charm.)</p>
<p>Among the remains, ""Hardrocklover"" would seem to be an opportunity for one of pop's most reliably sensuous guitarists to make up ground. But the song seems strangely subdued and bored with itself. While the lyrics (""Turn my guitar up so I can make this woman scream"") suggest that the inevitable appearance of guitar-heroism will be climactic, Prince's unfurling of his distorto-wail cape feels rote. The loopy-but-hard-hitting funk of ""X's Face"" is initially promising, though it too is thin on development. Elsewhere, the (mostly) instrumental ""Mr. Nelson"" riffs with a modicum of inspiration on remnants from <i>Art Official Age</i> standout ""Clouds"".</p>
<p>On a first listen, you might suspect that the album's opening sequence of not-disastrous (but not-terribly-memorable) EDM-influenced jams is going to be the focus of <i>HITNRUN Phase One</i>. Though this, too, is part of a formula: compare Prince's almost-rap flow on ""Shut This Down"" to that of 1992's ""My Name Is Prince"", and it's easy to see that the artist has a template for approaching ascendant pop trends. There are stray, tasty touches in this opening salvo—a brief electric-bass clinic in ""Shut This Down"", the integration of saxophone, rhythm guitar, and digitally programmed curlicues in the last minute of ""Like a Mack""—but experimental this ain't. Not for the artist who wrote and recorded ""Crystal Ball"", anyway. (By point of comparison: Prince has also made newly available some truly chancy and obscure work from the late 1990s—like the extended paranoid-freakout ""The War"" and the mostly-acoustic album <i>The Truth</i>—on Tidal.)</p>
<p>Disappointments and missed opportunities aside, it's still great to have an official, Prince-sung version of ""1000 X's &amp; O's"" (an old composition once <a href=""http://www.princevault.com/index.php/A_1,000_Hugs_And_Kisses"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">intended</a> for Rosie Gaines). When Prince sings in an environment unmolested by contemporary cliche, he gives us more than at any other point on <i>HITNRUN Phase One</i>—including that iconic, multi-tracked one-man choir, in addition to lyrics that, while they might not be much on the page, snap with a seductive pull when placed in his mouth (""Every drop of sweat on your brow/ Is well-earned/ So you best believe""). Even if, this time around, you can forget the familiar discographical parlor game of comparing each new Prince record to earlier triumphs—this one isn't his best album in the last twelve <i>months</i>, let alone years—songs and performances like that one show why it remains unwise to count him out.</p></div>"|21026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21026-hitnrun-phase-one/|4.5|Seth Colter Walls

Founding guitarist and songwriter Jeff Hanneman's passing in 2013 from cirrhosis of the liver looms large; it's impossible to overstate the impact he had on the group. His hardcore influences, and the way these influences warped the group's early NWOBHM style, formed the more extreme wing of thrash that would later inform death and black metal. Hanneman's death is Slayer's greatest concern, but it's far from the only one. Founding drummer Dave Lombardo quit in 2013 allegedly over money concerns, and Paul Bostaph, who played on Slayer's '90s records, returned to replace him. Bostaph is no slouch, but Lombardo is a once-in-a-lifetime talent, whose ferocity set the standard for metal drumming as a whole. The two remaining members, bassist/vocalist Tom Araya and guitarist Kerry King, also seem to be <a href=""http://radio.com/2015/05/14/slayer-interview-tom-araya-kerry-king/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">somewhat at odds</a> with the future of the band. King's never short of bluster and says Slayer will soldier on; Araya is a little more apprehensive. How much either's letting on is hard to determine, but there's definitely a rift.</p>
<p>There's also a clear waning in popularity. Slayer headlined this year's Mayhem Fest, which was plagued by attendance problems. It was depressing to see a legendary band barely filling amphitheaters and having to downgrade the venue in San Antonio, one of the most solidly metal cities in the States. King was also open with his disdain for the fest's lineup, and his online spats with tour organizer Kevin Lyman kept the metal news site Blabbermouth going this summer.<i></i> And <i>Repentless</i> is not Slayer's first album to be released on September 11—<i>God Hates Us All</i> came out the day of the attacks. In the case of <i>God</i>, it was an unfortunate but morbidly appropriate coincidence; with <i>Repentless</i>, it seems calculated to appeal to the basest shock values of metalheads. So, yes, it's easy to be cynical about a new Slayer record.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, <i>Repentless</i> is solid—far from a classic, but the best possible outcome. King and Araya may be drawing from the same well as they always have, but no one knows how to make a Slayer song like they do. Three decades on from <i>Hell Awaits</i>, ""Delusions of Saviour"" shows they still know how to create a lurching intro, minus Satan yelling ""WELCOME BACK!"" It leans heavy on the wah, but King doesn't overdose on it like Kirk Hammett would. The title track and ""Take Control"" display steadfast worship to their own speed; the product is quality, and <i>Repentless</i> does benefit from focusing on that speed Hanneman fostered. But ""When the Stillness Comes"" recalls <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWvqjLxd14M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Spill the Blood""</a> from <i>South of Heaven</i> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNFglDcW7dQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dead Skin Mask""</a> from <i>Seasons in the Abyss</i>, two of Slayer's slower classics. Araya works within his vocal limitations to complement King's rhythms to honor Slayer's slower side without straining or parodying himself. Sticking close to the Slayer playbook was probably the most sensical move—King and Araya have every chance to overindulge or lose the plot but don't. Most songs on <i>Repentless</i> will remind you of a specific track from Slayer's past, and there's enough diversity within their own style.</p>
<p>Losing two key members will irreversibly change dynamics, and <i>Repentless</i> isn't immune. Exodus' Gary Holt, Slayer's live guitarist since 2011, contributes solos, but King played almost all of the guitar here. There isn't the chaotic back-and-forth that Hanneman and King wrestled with in their prime. In fact, the solos are oddly conservative by Slayer standards. They fit, but Hanneman's loose touch is noticeably missing. King is essentially playing off himself—he can't be the more metallic foil to Hanneman's punk ear. Granted, he does wrangle a convincing homage to Hanneman's punkiness in ""Atrocity Vendor"". It's oddly a more fitting tribute than ""Piano Wire"", which Hanneman had a hand in writing. ""You Against You"" is another punky track that could have been slipped in <i>Undisputed Attitude</i>, and that it comes right after ""Wire"" and ""Atrocity"" suggests that Slayer made a little Hanneman suite in his honor.</p>
<p>Bostaph is a dependable presence, which is both a compliment and a slight. ""Vices"" and ""Take Control"" could have benefitted a little bit from Lombardo's intensity on the double bass. Still, he came into probably the toughest assignment of his career and knocked it out. Bostaph's return also brought back some of the more groove metal tendencies that Slayer adopted in the '90s, most evident in ""Implode"". ""Implode"" worked as a one-off single before it was known it was goning to be on the album, but it doesn't mesh with <i>Repentless</i> as a whole. It even brings down the second half of the record, which doesn't have a ""Stillness"" to compensate. For a band that made a genre-defining album that doesn't break 30 minutes (<i>Reign in Blood</i>), Slayer have lost a bit of their editing touch.</p>
<p>Will they continue after this record? If they do, and they're likely to milk at the very least a couple tours, <i>Repentless</i> doesn't spell their end. If they hang it up, at least they didn't end their career on an embarrassing note. Slayer, even with their recent turmoil, have had good fortune compared to their other peers in the Big Four. Their decline is more gradual, the kind that merely comes with age; they never fell off like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"">Metallica</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9199-megadeth/"">Megadeth</a> did. They've managed to produce one good record without two irreplaceable members; even so, <i>Repentless</i> doesn't quite answer if they've still got it for the long haul.</p></div>"|21001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21001-repentless/|6.8|Andy O'Connor

There are elements of dance music, rap, and rock scattered throughout his debut album,  <i>La Vie Est Belle / Life Is Beautiful</i>, but none of those labels quite describe his sound. And while Ilunga frequently incorporates elements of his half-Congolese, half-Angolan ancestry, his music shouldn’t be shoved off into that condescending, colonialist hangover, ""world music."" ""Psychedelically-tinged baroque contemporary African pop with heavy goth undertones"" is a mouthful, so ""noirwave,"" a descriptor coined by Ilunga himself, works as well as anything.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ilunga introduces us to his sound with a literal fanfare. Following an impressionistic, semi-abstract intro that sets up Ilunga’s predilections for complex rhythms and sensual modulated textures,<i> La Vie Est Belle</i> explodes with the chorus to his first single, ""Best"", which tops an achingly cathartic post-punk hook with an off-kilter brass arrangement that comes in from out of nowhere to flip the song’s buttoned-up synthpop mood on its head. The horns are jarring, bracing, and just dissonant enough to add a manic edge to the song. They sound like maybe they were inspired by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Ennio Morricone</a>, or maybe by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3025-neutral-milk-hotel/"">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>, or maybe by any number of brass bands you can find playing on streets from New Orleans to Kinshasa.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For listeners of a certain persuasion, trying to trace <i>La Vie Est Belle</i>’s sounds back to their influences can be a distractingly entertaining way to appreciate the record, especially when the trail gets as intriguingly ambiguous as that horn part. (Such as Ilunga’s supple, swooningly expressive baritone, which can sound a little like Dave Gahan and a little like David Bowie’s more lucid moments of the '80s.) It’s a tough game to keep up, though. All those different pieces come at you at a rapid pace, and it’s hard to keep an eye on the individual threads when Ilunga keeps pulling your attention back out to the entire tapestry.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In a pop music landscape where eclecticism has become the status quo, Ilunga’s not only pulling from a broader range of sounds than all but a few other players in the game, he’s able to synthesize them into a seamless sonic entity that stands entirely away from the pack. <i>La Vie Est Belle</i> is a gorgeous, complex trip, not just aesthetically but emotionally. By turns, it’s abysmally abject, bravely hopeful, unguarded, canny, sexy, and profound—the kind of richly, messily variegated album that only comes around a few times a year. </span>Yannick Ilunga feels like pop music's future—borderless but deeply rooted, challenging but pleasurable— and <i>La Vie</i> is strong enough to have earned Ilunga the right to call his revolution whatever he wants.</p></div>"|21012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21012-petite-noir-la-vie-est-belle-life-is-beautiful/|7.7|Miles Raymer

Lerner's flirtation with synths and machinery began on his 2013 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17748-telekinesis-dormarion/"" target=""_blank"">Dormarion</a>, </i>hinting that that he might someday trade indie pop for synthpop. As far back as his 2009 debut, he pled for the attending physicians of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVPvqUK2Kx4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Calling All Doctors""</a> to ""replace my heart with a machine."" With <i>Ad Infinitum</i>, the operation is complete.</p>
<p>Detailing his transformation in <a href=""https://medium.com/@_TELEKINESIS/ad-infinitum-7578af38fdf9"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a piece for Medium</a>, he says he spent much of the past two years amassing and learning how to use a collection of vintage synths, as well as hook them up with newer technology to make new music. <span>""</span>This proved to be incredibly time-consuming and, at times, a ridiculously difficult task,<span>""</span> he writes.</p>
<p>All of that ridiculous difficulty was time well spent: he has made some beautifully textured music with moods that recall the original '80s heyday of synthpop. <span>""</span>Edgewood<span>""</span> sounds like an outtake from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11881-speak-spell-music-for-the-masses-violator/"" target=""_blank"">Speak &amp; Spell</a></i> and the instrumental <span>""</span>Ad Infinitum, Pt. 1<span>""</span> recalls the grandeur and evocative melodrama of the first side of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Disintegration</a></i>.</p>
<p>Lerner also produced the album—a first for him—with some assistance from Eric Elbogen of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27707-say-hi/"" target=""_blank"">Say</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4124-say-hi-to-your-mom/"" target=""_blank"">Hi</a>. But the problem with taking on so many new responsibilities is that something's got to give. In this case, it's the lyrics. They're often vague and seem like they were the final pesky pieces that he fit into the process. He utters the word ""forget"" in more than half of the songs with lyrics, and ""future"" on three separate occasions. Though Lerner has learned well how to make these sounds, he doesn't elevate the form enough. </p>
<p>""Sleep In"", with its light hip-hop beat and elfin <i>ba-ba-ba-ba</i>-ing is <i>Ad Infinitum</i>'s most innovative track. Lerner gets in his own way on this song though, when he employs an actual <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM8FcN0aAvU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Speak &amp; Spell </a>machine. Whether it's a nod to the aforementioned Depeche Mode debut or not, it feels forced. (Though it doesn't induce as much of an eye roll as <a href=""https://youtu.be/hMvHWGFZKIs?t=2m22s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Limp Bizkit's Speak &amp; Spell experimentation</a>, it's not quite as cool as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNu7_CAJ3uA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">what Robyn and Röyksopp do</a> with the machine.)</p>
<p>Despite all of this, the songs still sound very much like Telekinesis. Lerner's songwriting is direct and even with all of this gadgetry he has a knack for a simple, effective melody. The harmony on ""Farmers Road"" is locked in tightly, and ""Ad Infinitum, Pt. 2"" feels like it's threatening to break into <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VpjSv_4QM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shining Star""</a> in the chorus. The tunes are sturdy, and depending on how ambitious Lerner is with this tour, he could easily put any of these songs into his comfortable power trio arrangement. He could even do them on an acoustic guitar, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii-nXSGjw1U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as he is wont to do</a>.</p>
<p>Lerner has reportedly said that he started collecting vintage synthesizers because he felt like he had already gotten all of the songs out of the guitar that he could. The songs he summons from the synths offer proof that there were more songs left in him, but he's still digging in the same mine. <i>Ad Infinitum</i> might be the sound of an artist challenging himself, but it's not the sound of an artist challenging his listeners.</p></div>"|20837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20837-ad-infinitum/|6.4|Pat Healy

Still, <i>Imagori</i> comes at a difficult time for him, having recently lost his old sparring partner in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8797-harmonia/"">Harmonia</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8799-dieter-moebius/"">Dieter Moebius</a>, who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60454-dieter-moebius-of-cluster-and-harmonia-has-died/"">passed away</a> in July. It’s unlikely Roedelius would let sentiment cloud his vision—much of his recent output is marked by a strict adherence to precision, culminating in works that feel like they were finely shorn down with an X-Acto knife. <i>Imagori</i> continues in that vein, with Roedelius linking up with Gotan Project member Christoph H. Müller. Over 10 tracks, the pair work around weighty, impenetrable electronics, dispensing with any loose ends and producing an overall sound positively suffocating in its density.</p>
<p>The genesis of Roedelius and Müller’s collaboration lies in a series of concerts undertaken in Paris in 2012, where the pair improvised on stage together. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/gotanprojectofficial/videos/10150767873756084/%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Video footage</a> of the events show the men bathed in stark white light, sharply dressed and fully focussed on the machines at their disposal, including a grand piano. <i>Imagori</i> is less tender than those performances, with the pair retreating into darkness in the studio. There’s a morbidity that eats away at the corners of these tracks, forming an atmosphere not far from the rolling banks of angst that blanketed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a>’s trip hop classic <i>Mezzanine</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Trip hop may seem an odd reference point for Roedelius, especially as it possesses an emotional weight he’s rarely approached in his career. Müller's work in Gotan Project veers far closer to the genre's environs, although this album lands some distance away from his output there. Instead, <i>Imagori </i>finds Roedelius and Müller setting genre ideas in the abstract, linking classical piano embellishments to twists of bass synth reminicent of <i>Mezzanine</i>’s ""Risingson"" (on ""Time Has Come"") and letting ripples of piano form an echo back to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Protection</i></a>’s ""Heat Miser"" (on ""Valse Mecanique""). The album contains an overall sketch-like quality, executed from shards of thought—not necessarily a bad thing, but not conducive to producing a work as enveloping as Harmonia’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kVr8_c-HJY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Watussi""</a> or Cluster’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLExozlYhtU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Caramel""</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a cameo from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> buried deep in <i>Imagori</i>, on a track about the process of recording music that's appropriately titled ""About Tape"". It’s a standout, largely because it forgoes the thickness that encases much of the album, instead working through glassier layers of electronics, plus a half-spoken, half-sung vocal from Eno that adds a welcome measure of eccentricity to an otherwise rather dry record. Its nadir comes on ""The Question"", where a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>-like robo-voice peers from its slowly shifting groove—an idea that feels a little too rote for someone of Roedelius’ stature. <i>Imagori</i> is perfectly serviceable as a piece of background noise, but it doesn’t work in the multifaceted way that Cluster and Harmonia albums can, where they either prick the attention or provide a soundtrack to other things going on. This just drifts along in its immaculately chiseled way.</p></div>"|21005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21005-imagori/|6.4|Nick Neyland

Condon had been embroiled in personal and creative despair for a few years, some of it the result of working on a new maximalist opus in the vein of his previous work. He abandoned this material to return to low-stakes jamming in a piano trio format; ultimately, <i>No No No</i>'s songs developed out of this approach, and the album was recorded in just a couple of weeks. The resulting nine-song, 29-minute barely-LP, appropriately, sounds like a collection of exposed scaffoldings—a record of a rehabilitative process, more a story of survival rather than a shot at reinvention.</p>
<p>It would be easy to assume that reinvention was foremost on Condon's mind. After all, his ethnomusicological interests and motley folk orchestras have next to nothing to do with today's musical landscape. Nine years ago, however, these elements seemed to fit in perfectly, distinguishing Condon from the expanding crooner rank-and-file (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2590-jens-lekman/"">Jens Lekman</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/356-andrew-bird/"">Andrew Bird</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4644-patrick-wolf/"">Patrick Wolf</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4542-rufus-wainwright/"">Rufus Wainwright</a>) and aligning him with a broader drift toward prewar—or, to use a once-popular keyword, ""sepia tone""—nostalgia (see also: the shanties and strophic ballads of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists/"">the Decemberists</a>, the carny/gypsy fusions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2938-man-man/"">Man Man</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1744-gogol-bordello/"">Gogol Bordello</a>). But it was doubtless Condon's sense of how to make his compositions sound ornate and simple at the same time—through triumphant, sometimes wordless choruses—that truly gained him his fanbase. His 2006 and 2007 releases were full of mild-mannered anthems that stood on their own—mix-CD-ready cuts like ""Postcards from Italy"", ""Elephant Gun"", and ""Nantes"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Unlike this formative work, there's a sense of absence in the music of <i>No No No</i>; sometimes Condon's commitment to simplicity leads to undeveloped ideas.<b> </b>Condon has honed his innate skill<b> </b>as an arranger of chamber horn and string ensembles over the years: The first half of his 2009 double EP, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12689-march-of-the-zapotec-holland/""><i>March of the Zapotec</i></a><span>, scored largely for 19-piece Mexican brass band, took his skill to its furthest level of complexity, while the follow up, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15715-the-rip-tide/""><i>The Rip Tide</i></a><span>, found him making a more serious bid for pop/rock crossover success. For Condon to put his big-bandleader chops to the side—so crucial to all of his previous work—on his first album in four years seems like a tacit acknowledgment that the style of his earlier music is no longer in vogue, as well as a need to find a new, less obsessive process.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When Condon <i>does</i> employ horns on the new album, they are effective precisely because they are so sparing: <span>The  writing has a punchier, more functional quality that is worlds away from his former</span><b> </b><span>brass chorale leviathans</span>. There are no vestiges of the approach that sometimes made it feel as if Condon had built his entire career in the shadow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3025-neutral-milk-hotel/"">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUdiq0ZHsjw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Fool""</a>. These are horn licks in the tradition of '60s and '70s R&amp;B, and all of the later pop music that bent it out of shape.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But though this is all new for Beirut, the charm of the well-chiseled, simplistic grooves is modest, and Condon's strong melodic voice is not always there to create a through line. It floats on top of everything like a decorative descant, which can sometimes be taken or left. The two-minute ""At Once"" pairs an irresolute, maddeningly cyclical four-chord piano progression with a melody that is mostly just one note, and vocals are eschewed entirely on ""As Needed"" (which sounds like we are hearing only the backing track for a ""Surfs Up""-like </span><i>Smile</i><span> outtake). It's sometimes easy to wonder what, exactly, Condon was going for when committing so fiercely to such lightly sketched ideas.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The answer would seem to be mood, or simply his own pleasure; Condon's own comments articulated how fun the process of making the album was. The greatest joy, however, seems to have occurred when these ideas were germinating, not being formalized and committed to wax. On midtempo flotsam like ""Pacheco"", or even the slightly awkward title track, the passion seems to have already been wrung out of the song. The best tracks are the most uptempo and groove-locked: moments where Condon's initial excitement seems to have seeped into his melodies. The clearest examples are ""Gibraltar"" and ""Perth"", with their syncopated guitar rhythms.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-8bbe0df9-9892-cea1-b812-d4d7de710593""><i>No No No</i><span> may sound ineffectual after a cursory listen, but it reveals some subtle pleasures if you keep it in rotation. Even potentially soporific moments like closer ""So Allowed"", with its borderline </span><i>West Side Story</i><span>-quoting chorus, are ultimately pleasant, and even poignant. But it lacks the melodic heft out of which Beirut briefly built an empire, and doesn't demonstrate Condon searching for something else to fill that void. While it definitely unifies itself around and gains some affective power from sounding unfinished, it still sounds it.</span></span></p></div>"|21003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21003-no-no-no/|6.7|Winston Cook-Wilson

Whether she's releasing new material as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a> or collaborating with bluesmen and noise savants (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2824-roy-montgomery/"">Roy Montgomery</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4683-xiu-xiu/"">Xiu Xiu</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5420-tiny-vipers/"">Tiny Vipers</a>), Harris builds up immersive, perplexing landscapes, tearing it all down just as we're starting to figure out where, exactly, we are.</p>
<p>For her latest creative venture Helen, Harris has teamed up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28298-eternal-tapestry/"">Eternal Tapestry</a> drummer Jed Bindeman, bassist/guitarist Scott Simons<b>, </b>and a mysterious, possibly mythic third collaborator (more on her later). Despite its purported origins as a thrash band, Helen's sun-baked ambient lands somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>'s distorted bliss and Eternal Tapestry's psyched-out experiments. Upon cursory listens, the band's debut album, <i>The Original Faces</i>, appears to be an accessible, if noisy, entry into the shoegaze-pop canon, not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5171-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow/"">A Sunny Day in Glasgow</a>'s excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19478-a-sunny-day-in-glasgow-sea-when-absent/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sea When Absent</i></a>. In all actuality, it's a little bit insane.</p>
<p>Harris' distorted, manipulated vocals divulge their secrets slowly, after the melodic sweetness wears off.  She plays with our senses and expectations: Listeners must wade through a creaky, corrupted tape sample to reach the triumphant roar of opening track ""Ryder""; when the drums finally kick in on the dreamlike ""Pass Me By"", it's with exaggerated, almost comic force, as though she's acknowledging our impatience. Her more nocturnal, funereal side informs the <i>The Original Faces</i>' best moments, particularly the achingly beautiful ""Violet"", which sounds like a memorial service being held 20 yards away from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a> rehearsal. </p>
<p>The other noteworthy member of the band is the album's mysterious, unidentified backup vocalist, whose vocals sound uncannily similar to Harris but are credited separately to ""Helen"". Is she Grouper's alter ego? An unnamed surprise guest? The mythical Greek heroine, a symbol for unattainable, destructive perfection? These are solid guesses, but I'm partial to imagining her as a ghost, who materializes every so often to bestow the music with an otherworldly presence. ""Helen""'s presence is tenuous; on cuts like ""Right Outcome"" and ""City Breathing"" her harmonies pierce the void to carry Harris' leads upward, while on ""Covered in Shade"" and ""Allison"", they're tucked away into the background. <span>Considering the mythical connotations of Helen's namesake, her presence makes sense here as an extension of the album's interest in the divide between delicate beauty and all-consuming din.</span></p>
<p>Whatever else she does, ""Helen"" helps diversify the sound of <i>The Original Faces </i>and injects a youthful spirit into the solemn proceedings. Along with other traces of pop, like the jangly interludes ""Motorcycle"" and ""City Breathing"", she provides a respite from the surrounding gloom. These ninety-second-ish ditties are too gaunt and echo-ridden to stand alone as memorable singles, but within the tempestuous framework of the album, their vulnerability hits like a late-summer thunderstorm.</p></div>"|20962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20962-the-original-faces/|6.9|Zoe Camp

The louder he shouted, the harder the band roared back, drowning his words under sheets of blistering squall. Like their Danish neighbors <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"">Iceage</a>, however, Lower's overheated punk has cooled down considerably as their scope has expanded. By last year's full-length <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19301-lower-seek-warmer-climes/""><i>Seek Warmer Climes</i></a>, which favored post-punk's slow crawl over hardcore's speed-trial tempos, the singer was no longer locked in bloody competition against the rest of the band. Lower's latest EP <i>I'm a Lazy Son…But I'm the Only Son</i> cements their new pecking order: Now Toubro's voice leads and everything else follows.</p>
<p>That voice has earned its place at the front of the mix. It's the band's strongest instrument, and it's never been more expressive than it is on these five songs. On opener ""At the Endless Party"", he croons ""Come on sweetheart, take me as I am/ Drag me to your chamber and toss me around,"" pulling at the word ""sweetheart"" until it becomes an accusation. It's the delivery of a desperate man trying to preserve his dignity in the face of dire need. ""We'll never connect; there's no way around it,"" he mourns. He's not the first guy to sing about using sex to numb the pain, but he may be the first to make the pain sound like the better alternative.</p>
<p>""Endless Party"" introduces the latest evolution in the band's sound, which undergoes a logical shift from post-punk to goth—specifically the booming goth rock of the '80s, when acts like Sisters of Mercy and the Cure recorded in what sounded like cobwebbed dungeons that had been improbably outfitted with high-end studios. The stark, churning bassline of ""Keep Me in Mind"" lurches as if it's weighed down by frost. Lower's commitment to goth's pervasive dreariness is impressive, though as <i>Only Son</i>'s unhurried closer ""Nasty Business"" crawls past the six-minute mark it's hard not to pine a little for the speed and brevity of their punk output. The band makes an effort to fill in the track's creaky expanses, coloring it with sober pianos and echoes of muted horns, but really, this is Toubro's show, and it's his poetry of sorrow that drives the EP. ""I deserve something more,"" he broods, ""So much given, nothing given in return."" On song after song, Toubro defends his own honor, demanding to be heard. And he is.</p></div>"|21004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21004-im-a-lazy-sonbut-im-the-only-son-ep/|6.4|Evan Rytlewski

She has the breathy, clear, slightly husky soprano voice that's come to characterize ""indie"" (the genre, not the ethos). She has the right image. She has the instrumental chops. She could have created songs that are more easily consumable than those on <i>Till It's All Forgotten</i>, songs that fit into TV and film montage or title sequences. She could have taken the easy road. We should all be thankful she didn't.</p>
<p>Like her countrywoman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31232-jenny-hval/"">Jenny Hval</a>, Jahnsen's work defies categorization and commodification at every turn. It's not in the least bit easy to create music that sounds truly like <i>you</i> and nobody else, but Jahnsen manages to do so. The instrumentation on <i>Till It's All Forgotten </i>is rich—electronics, horns, synth strings, piano, a standard guitar-based rock band, vocal manipulation—and though all that layering and texture could feel heavy and cluttered, it rarely does. Jahnsen has an ear for structure, always pulling when the song could have pushed, turning right when it could have turned left, never relying on ABABC to get her through. Opener and title track ""TIAF"" is a perfect example—it's a lush, beautiful song with stacked vocals and a cascading synth that would drift into quirky Starbucks background fare if not for the stuttering, off-time percussion that jars the song out of complacency.</p>
<p>The lyrical themes on <i>Till It's All Forgotten</i> always circle back to the gaps in human communication and the desire that grows in those damp, mossy spaces left open between us because we're too scared of our own shadows to look into them. It's an album about slippage, discomfort, unease. ""Bodies"", which was released as a single with an <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/read/exklusive-videopremiere-farao-bodies-867"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unsettling and intimate video</a> depicting the solitary and intense relationship between two teenage girls as they explore a landscape abandoned by adults, is a dense song even without the visuals, with its military-percussive lope and clot of horn punctuation. Jahnsen has said the song is about <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/06/22/surrender-to-bad-decisions-with-faraos-bodies"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""surrendering to bad decisions and consciously going down the wrong path""</a>, something all of us can relate to but few of us would brag about.</p>
<p>It's this commitment to quotidian territory  that makes <i>Till It's All Forgotten </i>so engaging. The delicate ""Hunter"" could read as a love song but is instead about the process of dehumanizing another. The haunting ""Feel"" could be simply about sexuality but is instead about the desire for deep connection with someone else. The sprawling ""Warriors"" refuses to lapse into epic inspirational platitude; it is about the exhaustion of being perpetually ready to fight. Jahnsen takes well-covered general themes and distills something small and strange out of each; her instrumentation is huge and complicated while her lyrics remain resolutely human-scale.</p>
<p>Jahnsen played and arranged many of the instruments on the album herself, and the album is like an expansive and bizarre terrarium in which Jahnsen has carefully called for the placement of each element. She places tinny synth microtones next to big wooden piano notes on ""Fragments"", a song about human complications, and she loops her vocals around these basic tones, she demonstrates how naturally complications arise from a simple setup. Arrangements this teeming could be claustrophobic, but Jahnsen exerts firm control over her rich and highly detailed world. It's her mastery and attention that is ultimately what, I suspect, makes her work so consistently complex and worthwhile.</p></div>"|20957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20957-till-its-all-forgotten/|7.1|Jes Skolnik

Last year, her label <a href=""http://crimeonthemoon.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crime on the Moon</a> released <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/06/san-francisco-is-doomed-music-comp/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>San Francisco Is Doomed</i></a>, a compilation of local acts—including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29837-mikal-cronin/"">Mikal Cronin</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1354-erase-errata/"">Erase Errata</a>—railing against the Google-led tech boom that’s pushed rents into the stratosphere and made America’s historic counter-cultural capital increasingly unaffordable for starving artists. Meanwhile, Lew used Cold Beat’s 2014 debut length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19498-cold-beat-over-me/"" target=""_blank""><i>Over Me</i></a>, to address the situation in more oblique terms, mining the feelings of dislocation and depression that result when your city no longer feels like home, and everything that once made it special has given way to consumerism and conformity. A glance at the imposing, sterile glass skyscraper on the cover of Cold Beat’s sophomore release, <i>Into the Air</i>, would indicate Lew is still waging war on search-engine ostracization. But, at the same time, the parting clouds above it suggest she’s starting to appreciate the silver linings of her situation.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like </span><i>Over Me</i><span>, </span><i>Into the Air</i><span> thrives on the oppositional tension between frigidity and motion inherent to the Cold Beat name, through a yin-yang balance of winsome '60s girl-group melodies and icy '80s post-punk. But the synth and drum-machine experiments sprinkled among </span><i>Over Me</i><span>’s guitar-battered rave-ups have been given much more room to flourish here. It’s to the point where Cold Beat effectively resemble two discrete bands: an endearingly scrappy garage-rock act and a mechanistic, melancholic electro-pop outfit. However, </span><i>Into the Air</i><span>’s savvy sequencing plots a gradual journey between these two poles, lending this seemingly compact 10-song, 31-minute album a more epic sense of scale. </span><i>Into the Air</i> is frontloaded with the most exuberant pop songs Lew has written to date—in particular, the gleaming jangle-punk jewel ""Broken Lines"", which barrels forth like a joyous, C86-ed take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/630-blondie/"">Blondie</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU3-lS_Gryk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dreaming""</a>. But by letting in more sun, Cold Beat also produce deeper shadows—after whipping through two breezy verses on ""Bruno"", the song’s propulsive bassline leads us into an exhilarating, stomach-turning descent that makes you feel like you’re rolling down Powell Street on a cable car with broken brake lines.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tellingly, the flow of <i>Into the Air</i> mirrors the very process of gentrification that’s weighed so heavily on Lew’s mind, transforming the opening tracks’ raw and restless energy into a more orderly and austere second act. ""Cracks"" is the album’s key transitional track, pitting Lew’s beautifully sighed chorus and circular-saw guitar noise against synth oscillations and a motorik rhythm track to usher us into the album’s electro-oriented back half. But as her sonic environs turn more chilly, Lew cranks up the heat: she delivers <i>Into the Air</i>’s most captivating performance on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"">Chromatics</a>-tinted nocturnalia of ""Spirals"", while on ""Ashes""—which evokes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMThz7eQ6K0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>a classic David Bowie song</span></a> in both name and ping-ponged synth squiggle—she renders post-apocalyptic scenes of fiery, floating detritus with an elated, operatic coo, as if gazing wondrously into a snow globe filled with black flakes. The San Francisco she once knew may indeed be doomed, but Lew will be ready to rebuild it from the rubble when the bubble inevitably bursts. </p></div>"|20974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20974-into-the-air/|7.7|Stuart Berman

She first appeared as a member of Brooklyn's Celestial Shore, a quirky art-rock quartet rising in the wake of Dirty Projectors and Vampire Weekend. After debuting her Empress Of alias with a series of </span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU27T04Zlok"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">color-coded song snippets</a> </span><span>on YouTube, she released an EP of shimmering synthpop just as kindred spirits like Phantogram, Grimes, and Purity Ring were crossing over. Now, she's stepping up as an avant-R&amp;B auteur with pop star potential—like </span>a Björk unleashing her inner Beyoncé. But each step of the way, Rodriguez has gradually become a more captivating singer, compelling songwriter, and creative producer. And what makes the first proper album from Empress Of so impressive is that it's not just Rodriguez's most outwardly pop-focused work to date, but also her most restlessly experimental and—as suggested by that stark, <i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_%28album%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Horses</a></i>-style cover shot—lyrically raw.   </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's that last point that provides the real revelation on <i>Me</i>. True to its title, <i>Me</i> is a vessel for Rodriguez's most personal thoughts; she wrote these songs during an extended sojourn to central Mexico, where she lived alone for five weeks at a friend's house in a remote small town. The intense isolation provided the opportunity to reflect upon her life back in Brooklyn with great clarity, as she laments the financial hardships of trying to make rent in a gentrified city (the steamy slow jam <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17658-empress-of-standard/"">""Standard""</a>) while acknowledging the luxury of living in a country with potable H20 (the rippling house of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17456-water-water/"">""Water Water""</a>). But for the most part, <i>Me</i> is a requiem for a doomed romance, and the greatest measure of Rodriguez's confidence is just how candid and vulnerable she allows herself to be here.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The bulk of </span><i>Me</i><span> forms a concept album of sorts documenting the life cycle of a relationship. She takes us from the sloppy hook-up sex of ""Make Up"" (""Nothing comes between us/ But a piece of latex/ When you tear my clothes off/ Like I was a paycheck"") to the obsessive dependency of ""Everything Is You"" (""All I want to be is you""). She chronicles the lapse into domesticity on ""Need Myself"" (""Can we stop watching the TV?/ Can I get up off of my knees?"") to the intoxicated post-breakup haze of ""To Get By"" and the heartache-induced insomnia of ""Icon"" (""Close my eyes/ I see your face/ I just keep myself awake""). Rodriguez's writing is loaded with vivid details (""I can hear you grind your teeth/ When you're laying fast asleep""), but the scenery will feel familiar to anyone who's languished in a partnership after the thrill is gone, and agonized over the decision to break free.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If the songs on </span><i>Me</i><span> resemble diary entries, the pages have been torn out and shuffled, so that events fall out of order. We are continually shifted between pre- and post-breakup experiences, which mimics the experience of sorting through a failed love. After all, our memories rarely materialize in chronological order—a fleeting fond reminiscence of an ex has the power to momentarily override the longing and pain that fueled it.</span> The narrative goes beyond Rodriguez's candid lyrics into the production itself, which offers dramatic commentary or reinforcement. When she confronts some cat-calling bros on ""Kitty Kat"", the track responds to her simple plea of ""let me walk away"" with a cluster of claustrophobic synth jabs. And the tripped-up groove of ""To Get By"" comes off like a bad trip in the middle of a nightclub, where your stomach turns queasy, knees wobble, and the faces of the dancers around you become slow-motion psychedelic smears.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-54e37776-99ed-bb0f-517a-609ebcce4ebb""><span>But Rodriguez is equally adept at channeling her inner turmoil into euphoric release, like on the </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5681-hercules-and-love-affair/""><span>Herculean</span></a><span> house romp ""How Do You Do It"" and the pitch-shifting space-disco delirium of ""Threat"". On the latter track, Rodriguez effectively coins </span><i>Me</i><span>'s don't-look-back mission statement by declaring ""our memories are a threat""—and by the time that chorus is punctuated by the blare of synthesized trumpets, her troubles are already forgotten. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-54e37776-99f1-3b7f-1419-6b12b2f34334""><span>Rodriguez may spend much of </span><i>Me </i><span>inside her mind, but it’s as much an invitation to get out of our heads.</span></span></span></span></p></div>"|20976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20976-me/|8.2|Stuart Berman

His comment might not be literally true (<a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided by Voices</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"">Daniel Johnston</a>, and countless others toyed with a similar level of fidelity), but there was something about the way Barlow made hiss and mistakes synonymous with his personality that made him special. It was part and parcel with the beautiful-loser tag he cultivated throughout his solo work. He wasn't espousing any discernible ideology, except maybe an inclination to find beauty in rough edges, and if to not self-consciously fuck up his work, at very least to accentuate its ugliness at moments. Barlow's work, in other words, has rarely been feel-good, and <i>Brace the Wave</i>, his first new collection of songs since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3733-sebadoh/"">Sebadoh</a>'s comeback 2013 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18482-sebadoh-defend-yourself/""><i>Defend Yourself</i></a>, is no exception.</p>
<p>This is music for late-night self-reflection, if not quite the self-loathing of the younger Barlow. While the elephant in the room throughout <i>Defend Yourself</i> was the dissolution of Barlow's marriage, <i>Brace the Wave</i> is somehow even more personal, delving into the minutiae of his collapse. On the opener ""Redeemed"", Barlow reveals to a newfound love, ""I need a place to hide/ Somewhere I can bring my thoughts to you/ And be redeemed."" The track builds slowly, hitting its emotional peak as he laments, ""Memories are made of razor blades"", and the gentle acoustic strum turns brittle and forceful.  </p>
<p>Redemption is a recurring theme throughout <i>Brace the Wave</i>, as Barlow's loves, past and present, collide in dreamlike succession. There is almost a sense that Barlow is watching his life flash before his  eyes: The twitchy ""Nerve"" pines for idyllic times as Barlow mischievously recounts, ""I remember we were hipsters sleeping with our cats/ Young and thin and fucking crazy/ Fine 'til something cracked."" On the stomp and stammer of ""Boundaries"", he disarmingly concedes, ""You made yourself available/ I crawled into your arms.""</p>
<p>One of the first songs Barlow ever released, on Sebadoh's <i>Weed Forestin'</i>, was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTuGJ35xXhQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ride the Darker Wave""</a>. On the track, rife with wanton aggression, Barlow implores flippantly, ""Hello tomorrow today/ Ride the darker wave."" Contrast this with ""Wave"", the semi-titular track of <i>Brace the Wave</i>, which reads like an ambivalent breakup note, as Barlow enumerates his own defects (""When I'm not home for ages/ I look for ways to fade"") while abjectly entreating ""I leave you alone but don't go"", before accepting the inevitable (""I don't heed the warning signs/ It's our time""). It's a devastating recognition of a relationship long past its expiration date, and like the rest of <i>Brace the Wave</i>, echoes the complexity of ending an adult relationship with dignified resignation. </p>
<p>Barlow isn't the yearning aesthete any longer, and he doesn't act like one. But what's most remarkable about this album is, despite the high gravitas of the subject manner, it still manages to capture the yearning and imagination of youth, and never loses touch with the redemptive qualities of interpersonal connectedness. Life and relationships rarely offer easy answers, and <i>Brace the Wave</i> doesn't either.</p></div>"|20946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20946-brace-the-wave/|7.1|John Everhart

It’s a world populated by hoodrats and club kids, by dealers and party girls, by guys who look like André Cymone and women named Robbie Robertson (""but people call me Robo""), by the financially desperate and the spiritually confused. Each new song and each new album expands that universe significantly, implicitly or explicitly adding new chapters to ongoing stories as Finn hangs out off to the side, narrating from the periphery of the scene.</p>
<p>It can be forbidding to pick up these narrative strands at this late date, but at his best Finn’s songs swallow you up in that word entirely. His lyrics continually provoke a spark of recognition, as he invites you to connect the dots between a new song and an old one. Listening to ""Sarah, Calling from a Hotel"", from his new solo album, is a bit like eavesdropping on a friend who has landed on rough times. ""Hadn’t seen her since the races at the ending of last summer,"" Finn sings over a sparse coffeehouse strum. ""We watched the horses run up on each other/ She looked pretty."" Is this the unnamed subject of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOFeaedv3Uc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chips Ahoy!""</a>, from the Hold Steady’s 2006 breakthrough <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9474-boys-and-girls-in-america/"">Boys and Girls in America</a>, </i>the clairvoyant who ""can tell which horse is gonna finish in first""?</p>
<p>If so, the tone of chapter is much darker and more dire than migraines and emotional detachment. <i>Faith in the Future</i> is a character-driven record, even if it doesn’t restore Finn to the heights of his mid-2000s heyday. It’s full of prominent proper names: Sarah and Maggie, Christine and Sandra. St. Peter even shows up, because this is a Craig Finn album. The names are mundane, not exotic. You probably don’t know anyone named Charlemagne, but you’re likely Facebook friends with a Christine. There’s not a single hoodrat on <i>Faith</i>, but there are plenty of people caught between the youthful indiscretions of the past and the adult consequences of the present.</p>
<p>That pretty much describes Finn these days. Even during the disastrous Bennigan’s gig in ""Roman Guitars"", he comes across as more grown up, imbuing his narrators/stand-ins with a maturity that pushes them even further into the margins—the fate of all thirty- and fortysomethings. He’s no longer talking to the kids, and he’s not coming up the stairs or coming from the streets. Instead, he has entered what you might call the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wolf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter Wolf</a> phase of his career, when the old band has sputtered out and the frontman tries to re-establish himself as a serious songwriter. And if you don’t know who Peter Wolf is, well, then you’ll realize there is a certain unglamorous anonymity that comes with respectability.</p>
<p>The catch, of course, is that the Hold Steady and the J. Geils Band were great groups—exciting and clever and bold and even fun as they wallowed in rock’s less reputable urges. Downplaying riffs in favor of texture, <i>Faith in the Future</i> plays it much safer, which means there’s more emphasis on the words than on Finn’s delivery of them. Finn’s solo debut, 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16201-clear-heart-full-eyes/"">Clear Heart Full Eyes</a></i>, attempted to match his songs to amiably twangy arrangements, which in retrospect was an intriguing experiment, but there’s no comparable strategy in place for enlivening these songs. There’s a lot of bland acoustic strumming, as though the austerity of the arrangement were meant to reinforce the slice-of-life songwriting, but anyone who has ever skipped ""Citrus"" or bristled over <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10136-live-at-fingerprints/"">Live at Fingerprints</a></i> knows that acoustic isn’t Finn’s best setting. He doesn’t always have to have a rousing bar band behind him, but he does need something that will lend his lyrics more immediacy and higher stakes.</p>
<p>The best songs succeed despite the music, not because of it. ""St. Peter Upside Down"" may be the most compelling song of his solo career, a sharp juxtaposition between romantic regret and religious sacrifice that somehow grows more burdened, more beat down with every iteration of its chorus. Finn has, of course, plumbed similar territory in the past, but instead of redundant, it plays like the culmination of his obsession with Catholicism, as though he’s adding an epilogue to his previous spiritual inquiries. As it proceeds, <i>Faith in the Future</i> becomes more and more a benediction for the scene, a goodbye to all that. The perfectly titled ""I Was Doing Fine (Then a Few People Died)"" sounds impossibly world-weary, as Finn gets drunk with an old friend (possibly, hopefully even Sarah herself). ""She said some nights I wonder if anything means anything,"" and the only consolation he can offer is, ""I never said I was Jesus.""</p></div>"|20993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20993-faith-in-the-future/|6.3|Stephen M.

The Seattle experimentalist is best known for the woozy ambient music he has released as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32250-k-leimer/"">K. Leimer</a>, but Savant’s approach was something like an avant-garde jam band re-imagined as musique concrète. Riffs, grooves, and rhythms were crafted on a wide array of instruments—electric bass, drums, Oberheim DMX, Prophet 5 synthesizer, and objects identified in the credits with names like ""Percussion (Wood, Silver, Plastic),"" ""Guitar (Prepared, China),"" and ""Guitar (Cloud Guitars)""—and then broken apart, looped, layered, run through primitive effects, and reassembled at last by the razor-wielding producer across lengthy spools of reel-to-reel tape.</p>
<p>The recombinant approach had something in common with <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>’s work during the period, particularly his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a> collaboration <i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i> (Eno, too, was fond of fanciful instruments like “snake guitar”), and the results similarly hovered somewhere between funk, loosely speaking, and more abstracted forms of ambient sound. Debut single ""Stationary Dance"", with its breakbeat structure and a voiceover sampled from an instructional LP, anticipated cut-and-paste artists like M|A|R|R|S and Coldcut by six or seven years, while the watery B-side, ""Sensible Music"", sounds today like a more muscular, lo-fi version of Talk Talk’s later work. Listeners familiar with Leimer’s solo catalog will detect echoes of that music here: the glassy synthesizers of his ambient recordings trace serpentine paths through Savant’s songs, and the rolling, otherworldly drum programming of K. Leimer’s 1983 album <a href=""http://www.palaceoflights.com/?display_album_info=93"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Imposed Order</i></a> bleeds through into the stop-start rhythms of ""The Neo-Realist"" and ""Indifference"".</p>
<p>But the bulk of Savant’s catalog sounds like nothing else that had come before. These tracks, where skeletal dub rhythms underpin an array of daubed-on splotches of electric bass and Clavinet and atonal guitar, feel less like ""songs"" than amorphous organisms where a rippling pulse is the only constant. The structure can be hard to follow but in a fascinating way—long and convoluted 10-bar phrases are not uncommon, and it often feels like a rug is being pulled out from under you, even when the bassline plunges deep in the pocket. ""Shadow in Deceit"" begins with a flurry of bells and post-punk bass and gradually transforms, via interlocking marimbas, into a vivid template for <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>’s brand of new-age techno. ""Heart of Stillness"", with its unsteady pitter-patter percussion and dripping guitar tones, has an even headier rainforest vibe; it feels like sound just on the cusp of coalescing into music, or perhaps vice versa.</p>
<p>Given that the bulk of the album’s tracks were made between 1981 and 1985, it’s harder to judge the final three cuts, all previously unreleased, which date from between 2009 and 2014. ""Facility"" is dark and alluring, and it’s not hard to imagine it appearing on a contemporary label like R&amp;S. But the context differs so radically from the early work that the later songs might as well constitute a different project altogether. But that’s OK—the 11 songs that comprise Savant’s prime output amount to some of the most striking and original American electronic music of that period, so much so that it seems almost inconceivable that it went largely overlooked until now. Had a tastemaker like Detroit’s Electrifying Mojo gotten his hands on Savant’s slim catalog, who knows how things might have turned out. <i>Artificial Dance</i> is enough to make you rethink what you thought you knew about that era—and to make you wonder what else might be out there, just waiting to be rediscovered.</p></div>"|20953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20953-artificial-dance/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

Versed in the foreboding thump of Atlanta trap but very much New York in spirit and form, Chinx at his best (the mischievously weird <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi0jI40hTOA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm a Coke Boy""</a>, from <i>Cocaine Riot 2</i>), suggested that Coke Boys could be more than just <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"">French Montana</a>'s goon squad. Then one May morning the unthinkable happened: Chinx was killed as shots were fired at his car outside of a venue he’d just performed. He was only 31, married with three children and a fourth on the way.</p>
<p>As a method of coping with the loss, his manager and close collaborators gathered to honor their friend the only way they knew how: workshopping the sessions he’d left behind. As a result, <i>Welcome to JFK</i> is a different kind of hip-hop debut. Instead of pointing the rapper toward the places he could go, <i>JFK</i> hint at places he might’ve gotten. From the dejected Auto-Tuned opener ""Experimental"", in which Chinx sings ""I swear I want this to last us a lifetime"", to the foreboding closer ""Die Young"", the specter of mortality haunts the proceedings.</p>
<p>Despite all of this,<i> </i>it's a testament to Chinx's still-growing pop smarts that<i> Welcome to JFK </i>is sometimes a lot of fun. ""Experimental""’s mournful opener is quickly offset by a stream of upbeat shots at radio play. ""Thug Love"" and ""The Other Side"" spring for help from outside singers, the former calling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a> for the chorus and the latter tapping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> in full goon regalia. The real gem of the batch is ""Yay"", a bratty bit of spiteful money counting that is concise and catchy without sacrificing Chinx’s dopeboy veneer.</p>
<p>For the stretch of songs from the wistful pep talk ""How to Get Rich"" through the closing Coke Boys posse cut ""Die Young"", <i>Welcome to JFK</i> tenses up and eases off the good times. Chinx walks his audience behind the triumph of ""Go Get It"" and ""Yay"" to illuminate the hard decisions and paranoia that accompant success on the streets. ""Pray"" pairs him up with Chicago Coke Boys affiliate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"">Lil Durk</a> as each ponders mortality and their legacy. In the latter, Chinx raps chillingly about a nightmare in which he gets shot in the head, only to dive into a chorus essentially eulogizing himself. <i>Welcome to JFK</i> doesn’t allow much comfort. The album is by turns a succession of punchlines so snarky it’s upsetting Chinx won’t be around to write more of them and an unnerving trip into a mind coming to terms with the ever-present reality of sudden death.</p></div>"|20924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20924-welcome-to-jfk/|7.3|Craig Jenkins
