    fairytale and horror show, a mix of surrealism, magical realism, and poetic visuals that explores the
    fears, desires, and sexual awakening of a young girl.  That film-- which lends part of its title to
    Broadcast's ""Valerie""-- is also a fitting inspiration for the Birmingham, England band's second full-length
    album, <i>Haha Sound</i>, which walks a rope between awe and dread, human longing and sonic unrest.</p><p>
<i>Haha Sound</i> is a sharp turn from Broadcast's debut full-length, <i>The Noise Made by People</i>, and
    their early singles (collected on 1997's <i>Work and Non-Work</i>).  As their album titles indicate,
    Broadcast are steeped in the exploration of the detail and nuance of ""noise"" and ""sounds.""  On <i>The
    Noise Made by People</i>, the band created seamless, languid, soothing dreamscapes; here they've opted
    for a more cluttered, percussive rattle.  As she has in the past, vocalist Trish Keenan still seems as
    if she's singing lullabies, though the rest of the group is more intent on inflicting nightmares.  Keenan's
    opening confession and request, ""I am gray/ Still on the page/ Colour me in,"" is heeded over the course of
    the record by her bandmates as her detached vocals and fragile melodies are accompanied by a carnival of
    vintage electronics and sometimes-cacophonous sheets of polyrhythms.</p><p>
    
    Broadcast again retain their affection for charity shop sounds here, but the past they now explore is the
    mythical ideal of our millennial future as popularized in the 1950s by post-war consumerism-- a wide-eyed
    vision that found province in science fiction films, mid-century modern furniture, and the spectral pop
    produced by outer-space abstractionists like Joe Meek and Phil Spector.  The ghost of Meek, in particular,
    is echoed most clearly on ""Man Is Not a Bird"", ""Minim"", and a trio of short instrumentals, which may be
    slightly off-putting to long-time listeners accustomed to Broadcast's sultry, soothing sounds.  Fortunately,
    however, <i>Haha Sound</i> is compelling right from the word go, thanks to the leftfield Big Top melody of
    ""Colour Me In""-- perhaps the band's most overt homage to their unofficial patron saints, 60s psych-pop
    group The United States of America-- and the propulsive ""Pendulum"".</p><p>
    
    A pop/rock band that has been affiliated with Drag City, Tommy Boy, and Warp, Broadcast seem comfortable
    as outsiders searching for their own unique aesthetic.  On ""The Little Bell"", Keenan claims: ""Deep inside
    my wooden clock, there is a tick but not a tock/ Although into a room it chimes/ It only tells me half the
    time.""  She could have easily been talking about Broadcast's approach to creating off-kilter beauty.  On
    <i>Haha Sound</i>, Broadcast take the infectious tick of pop and add it to the head-music tock of often
    non-pop genres (European art house soundtracks, exotica, incidental music, <i>Ohm</i>-style electronic
    pioneers).  The result is an enveloping, mysterious record that marries the idealism of ""the future of
    tomorrow today"" to the stark reality of the post-millennial present and finds beauty and fascination in
    the tussle between melody and rhythm.</p></div>"|947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/947-haha-sound/|8.2|Scott Plagenhoef

These
    bands attempt to meticulously emulate that which they cannot themselves imagine, and always to middling
    results.  Others mimic certain elements of multiple bands and combine them into one incongruous whole.
    Still others snatch bits of existing songs, employing artist license to add heft to their own work by
    nabbing someone else's.  These techniques are rarely effective in any other respect than making these
    bands look like total dipshits.  But there's one technique that consistently produces interesting results:
    when a band simply touches the influences that inspire them, acknowledging their force but also challenging
    them.  Music as an artform evolves when talented bands touch and are touched-- when, if you will, they abide
    by Newton's Third Law of Motion.</p><p>
    
    Ambulance Ltd. is a young, talented Brooklyn quintet that violates that law. Their self-titled EP is a
    collection of five vastly different songs, each an expert forgery of the work of some 90s indie rock muse.
    But considering the band's malleability and wide-ranging rock sensibility, it's particularly frustrating
    that these songs are only isolated forgeries and not the riveting atom-splitters that could have resulted.</p><p>
    
    ""Stay Where You Are"" is Ambulance's Elliott Smith song.  Like all Smith compositions, it's melodically very
    pretty-- singer Marcus Congleton even pulls off a confident imitation of Smith's vocals. Guitars are subdued,
    only coming to prominence every two bars to announce a change in chord, but providing a distinct internal
    drive. The drumming is masterfully subtle: the bass drum puts four to the floor, accompanied by a steady
    ride and some occasional tom work.  It takes two minutes, however, for a snare to enter the mix at all,
    finally breaking up the bass drum's steady pound and setting the rest of the instrumentation free.  It's
    slightly gimmicky, sure, but the effect is nicely dramatic, and has much to do with this track being the
    EP's standout.</p><p>
    
    After the ho-hum, honky-tonk regurgitation ""Primitive (The Way I Treat You)"", Ambulance launch into ""Heavy
    Lifting,"" a song composed of three very distinct parts.  First comes the My Bloody Valentine shoegazing
    portion, followed by an early Beatles interlude, and then, perhaps ironically, a climax unlaudably ripped
    from the piano solo in Guns N' Roses' ""November Rain"".  Elsewhere, ""Helmsman"" learned everything it knows
    from <i>Washing Machine</i>-era Sonic Youth, while ""Young Urban Professional"" is a fun lilt that one very
    well could have found on Yo La Tengo's most recent effort, <i>Summer Sun</i>.</p><p>
    
    There have been several other bands mentioned as reference points for Ambulance Ltd.-- more than anyone
    could reasonably be expected to tolerate-- but it serves to reiterate that Ambulance is truly a very
    malleable band with tons of energy and much occupation with detail.  Here, they've very meticulously
    (though perhaps unwittingly) isolated their influences.  With any luck, they'll grow more adventurous
    on future releases, <i>recontextualize</i> those influences, and arrive at their own unique sound-- a
    blueprint for future Ambulance Ltd.'s to emulate in their embryonic stages.</p></div>"|407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/407-ambulance-ltd-ep/|6.4|Nicholas B. Sylvester

He had initially entertained dreams of being a classical     composer and conductor, but when his ideas brushed up against an academy     who hadn't come to grips with musique concrete (much less rock and roll),     his plans changed, and soon he found himself under one of the few     sympathetic souls in new music, Karlheinz Stockhausen.  That's an     understatement, of course, as Stockhausen was arguably the highest figure     in modern classical music beginning from the 1950s and to now, and his     work looms large over any experimental music being made during the time     young Czukay would have been with him-- be it classical, rock or otherwise.</p>
<p>During the mid-60s, Czukay also taught composition; one of his students was     an even younger Michael Karoli, and through him, Czukay was introduced to     the world of rock via The Beatles and The Velvet Underground.  He then teamed     up with fellow Stockhausen associate Irmin Schmidt, a jazz drummer called     Jaki and an American street poet of some esteem.  The rest is history.</p>
<p>Oh, but then there was the part about how Czukay was one of the first people     to sample, and about how his solo music of the late 60s is among is some of     the most groundbreaking in all of electronic music.  And by the way, he's     still pushing forward in his own music, turning out better beats and more     interesting textures than most DJs half (or even a third) his age.  If this     sounds like an infomercial, it's only to set up the intimidating backlog of     history one might consider when approaching a new Czukay record.  There, now     it's your turn to carry the baggage.</p>
<p>Luckily, Czukay's music is fresh enough that you don't have to remember the     good old days to appreciate it.  Unlike all but the most tirelessly devoted     classical alchemists (sorry Kraftwerk), this man at 65 is pressing on like     someone without the slightest care for pacing or an idea of how people his     age are supposed to drift away.  <i>The New Millennium</i> (despite library     fines on the title) is his latest collaboration with the enigmatic,     tone-be-damned seductress U-She-- or as Czukay's website about her says,     ""under construction.""  It's a record that pulls out many of the composer's     familiar ideas, but is also admirably modern-- almost effortlessly so.     Ultimately, he hasn't slowed down, and that's good news.</p>
<p>Since <i>The New Millennium</i> begins with a piece called ""Le Secondaire""     (a remix of an older Czukay tune called ""La Premiere"") built out of bits     of Can's ""Chain Reaction"", you'd be forgiven for thinking he was attempting     to pillage his back catalog for ideas.  In a way, maybe he was, but since     he's been putting samples to good use for decades, no one should be shocked     that he's able to make some pretty captivating house out of that stuff now.     U-She's French vocals fight off a whole cast of other voices spouting things     in varied speeds, and out-of-time drum machine breaks punctuate the beat     where most dance producers would patch in a cymbal swell.  Likewise, on     ""Rosebud"", the holy house bass drum drafts no snare to back it up and only     a chorus of U-She and Sinai fanfares to give it color.  Czukay's version of     dance music is just as tribal as it ever was, but these days his flair for     pristine production and immaculately placed, ever-changing samples that make     up the real heart of his music are the marks of a master.</p>
<p>Not every tune is there for the grinding: ""Cinderella"" begins with a frantic     flurry of triangle and church bells with accented bass notes in the piano.     Before long, the ensemble gives way to cavernous echo and fidgety tic-tac     percussion, and just as suddenly, the ""beat"" comes back with electro congas     and art-house horror asides from U-She.  In truth, her contributions may not     be everyone's idea of interesting, but in the context of these pieces she     actually manages to tie otherwise unconnected sections together, forging     an unlikely ""pop"" out of ""avant-garde.""</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the only time this     doesn't really work is on the de facto pop song of the bunch, ""Millennium"".     It isn't so much that U-She wavers ever so slightly with the tune so much     as Czukay's arrangement of oboes and New Age synth never manage to crash     the party of big fat 80s drums.  This is a shame, too, because ""Millennium""     is exactly the kind of song Can made work-- think ""Moonshake"" with more     than one good chord change.</p>
<p>""Supernova"" features Czukay's own spoken-word vocals over still more restless,     precision jitter-house.  I hear samples of strange Eastern stringed instruments,     what sounds like a chamber ensemble of saws and cellos, several thousand     percussion instruments that go ""ping,"" and oddly timed handclaps and one-measure     organ solos.  ""Metropolis"" begins with a loop of flute, succeeding to bassoon     and then onto spooky reverb and atonal guitar mutterings.  Throughout <i>The     New Millennium</i>, the details impress and their integration into an     interesting whole seals the deal-- and despite all of this, it's still U-She's     relatively untouched vocals that seem most out of place.</p>
<p>The first time I listened to this album, I was a little disappointed that     Czukay's drum sounds seemed a tad dated, as if from the not-so-distant past.     However, those kinds of worries could take a backseat the more I concentrated     on the number of other things happening in his pieces.  Obviously, if you're     looking for something to spin during a mix, <i>The New Millennium</i> might     not be the best choice-- at least at first.  Still, Czukay's been called ""subversive""     before, and under the right circumstances, I could see him infiltrating a whole     new academy.</p>

    Due in no small part to the ghetto-tech innovations of The Neptunes/Timbaland axis, even the hardest-to-please
    music fans have, over the past few years, been flocking to the mainstream for their hip-hop fixes-- but now,
    with Def Jux running underground shit and endless collectives (the Anticon, Rhymesayers, and Stones Throw
    crews, to name just a few) thriving, some of the illest stuff going these days is flying well below the MTV
    radar.</p><p>
    
    Stones Throw, in particular, has had one hell of a productive year, with MC/producer/ringleader Madlib's
    seemingly endless stream of records (<i>Madvillain</i>, <i>Jaylib</i>, <i>Yesterday's New Quintet</i>,
    <i>Shades of Blue</i>) and recent releases by Dudley Perkins and Stark Reality responsible for much of the
    label's recent acclaim.  Strange, then, that the anticipated solo release by Madlib's Lootpack cohort
    Wildchild is so very pedestrian.  Produced by Madlib and fellow Stones Throw-er Oh No, <i>Secondary Protocol</i>
    should, by all accounts, be one of the year's hip-hop highlights.  Instead, it's a merely passable record
    marked by a handful of solid singles.</p><p>
    
    There are certainly plenty of interesting ideas at work here, and sometimes they come together: The first
    of the aforementioned singles, ""Code Red"", won't settle the ongoing debate over Wildchild's lyrical skills,
    but the banging, clickety-clack percussion track will surely keep heads nodding.  The other, ""Party Up"",
    rides on a funk bassline and scratchy, distant bell percussion, with female vocals providing the song's
    hook-- both tracks, recently featured on a single 12-inch, will likely make lots of hipster mixtape-hitlists
    this year.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, ""Wonder Years"" shows Wildchild's flow at its best, albeit with at least one head-scratching
    line: ""Child ponders, 'Why is it okay to drink when marijuana is still illegal?/ Though I don't smoke I wish
    I knew how to change it for my people.""  Coming from such a close associate of Madlib (by his own admission,
    motherfucker smokes enough herb that he should've turned into a bush by now), such a declaration of personal
    innocence seems downright odd.</p><p>
    
    Lyrical enigmas notwithstanding, <i>Secondary Protocol</i> has trouble creating an aesthetic identity.  ""The
    Movement"" shapes up as a routine ""respect for hip-hop"" number, with Wildchild dropping overwrought lines
    about his loyalty to the hip-hop tradition (""Making 'em pack deep/ Like the movie <i>Wild Style</i> did it"").
    And while ""Bounce"" and ""Secondary Protocol"" show promise, they quickly wind up encumbered by too many ideas
    crammed into tiny sonic spaces.  ""Bounce"" is especially reprehensible: it begins interestingly enough, with
    flatulent synth burbling, but by the time the vocals kick in, the track reveals itself as a decent production
    idea burdened by its clumsy execution.  Tuneless, defiantly funkless, and packed full of weak rhymes, it's
    the absolute nadir of both this record and Wildchild's career to date.</p><p>
    
    ""Code Red"" ends with a mock Q&amp;A; session between Wildchild and a probing journalist. Responding to a question
    about the album's personal nature, Wildchild goes off on a tangent to explain that <i>Secondary Protocol</i>
    is for ""the mainstream heads, the worldwide heads, universal.""  And therein lies the problem: he seems to
    want this record to be all things to all people.  There's not a lot obviously wrong here, but coming from a
    member of the Lootpack (whose 1999 LP <i>Soundpieces: Da Antidote</i> was a milestone for underground hip-hop),
    <i>Secondary Protocol</i> is just too damn homely to make a lasting impression in these heady days of
    consistently intense one-upmanship throughout the underground scene.</p></div>"|8758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8758-secondary-protocol/|6.3|Brad Hurst

Well, let me clarify that a bit-- it's easy being a band
    with an image schtick, like Manowar in their leather underwear and fantasy battle gear, but not to be a band
    with a musical one: after all, staying within the set parameters of one distinct sound tends to result in
    artists either making the same album over and over again, or limiting their creativity to the point that
    the quality of their music suffers.</p><p>
    
    Morphine had that problem to a degree, but they compensated with little deviations like ""In Spite of Me"",
    and ultimately even abandoned their stripped bass/drums/sax approach on their overlooked swansong, <i>The
    Night</i>.  The fact is, Morphine had to change on that last album to avoid becoming totally lost in the
    cul de sac they found themselves in on their previous release, 1997's <i>Like Swimming</i>.  God only knows
    what they'd sound like today if Mark Sandman was still with us.</p><p>
    
    Traveling further up the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority's Red Line, we find another Boston-area band
    discovering that a distinctive sound can quickly become a well-worn rut, and subsequently branching out.
    Guster originally emerged from Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts in the mid-90s with a pair of
    self-released albums that brought their two-guitars-and-bongos busker act to the studio and earned them a
    bucketload of worshipful praise from the Boston music press.  There was a charming simplicity to their
    portable music, but-- as my esteemed colleague Mark Richardson once remarked about them on this very site--
    when you're doing the stripped-down acoustic thing, every song has to hit hard or your album won't hold up.</p><p>
    
    Guster actually realized this in time for their third album, 1998's <i>Lost &amp; Gone Forever</i>, an album I
    still give a spin from time to time.  That record could have easily been trounced by Steve Lillywhite's
    spit-shine production, but the songs were so intricately layered and expertly crafted that I didn't really
    mind.  Still, that album's liner notes crowed about the fact that all the drumming was done sans-sticks,
    and the band's overall dynamic and intensity hadn't changed at all-- they'd just elevated their craft and
    got a bigger budget.  A whole five years later, the band has given up all pretense of preserving their
    original setup, purchased a drumkit. generously endowed each of their songs with basslines, and even gone
    so far as to bring aboard Yo La Tengo producer Roger Moutenot.</p><p>
    
    The trio certainly has no shortage of catchy melodies on hand here, and they open with a three-song volley
    that'll stick straight to the roof of your mouth.  ""Diane"" is brisk, polite pop spattered with sparingly
    applied harmonies, while ""Careful"" takes that formula and squares it, ratcheting up the harmonies the band
    does so well and taking the time for details like a brief tempo change and some burbling guitar jangle.
    But it's ""Amsterdam"" you'll never get out of your head-- this song is so insidiously catchy it could be
    the theme to a fucking sitcom.  It's not as cloylingly sentimental as, say, The Rembrandts, but it's got
    the requisite squeaky-clean jangle and buoyant harmonies for any number of Jason Alexander vehicles
    currently in development.</p><p>
    
    The highlight award is stolen by ""Homecoming King"", which gives a nod to the hand percussion they
    built their name on, but makes full use of a rubberband bassline and some harp-like, almost African guitar
    parts.  What <i>Keep it Together</i> has in highs, though, it also has in ho-hum middles-- indeed, it never
    approaches the track-to-track mastery that <i>Lost &amp; Gone Forever</i> did, painting the corners with
    midtempo filler like ""Backyard"" and ""Ramona"", which are by no means bad, but won't likely grab you at
    all, either.  The band are naturally right at home with the front porch banjo folk of ""Jesus on the Radio"",
    but when they try a detour into stuttering prog-pop on the cheekily titled ""Red Oyster Cult"" (you forgot
    the umlaut, guys-- get on the ball!), they wind up wasting some good melodies on a distracting arrangement
    that thinks it's ""Achilles' Last Stand"".</p><p>
    
    The thing that really bothers me the most about this album is how conventional it sounds.  Guster are
    undeniably accomplished tunesmiths, but the quirks that show up here in the form of, say, the background
    whistling on ""Long Way Down"" or the strange schoolkid choir and fluffy strings of the hidden track used to
    be more prominent, and it made them a band you could embrace for their artfulness as much as you could
    listen to them.  There's still plenty of chicken soup for your pop soul here, but this time the broth is
    from concentrate.</p></div>"|3609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3609-keep-it-together/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    solitary game of critical Taboo: it's instantly apparent that there exists a specific set of unavoidable
    descriptive clichés and overly pitched idiosyncrasies chaperoning all previous and current press for this
    band-- often due to an inability to creatively parallel the level of the phenomenon: the more unique the
    spectacle, the less inventive the appraisal.  So, in honor of the tenth anniversary of the Milton Bradley
    game of terminological no-no, I've drawn up a shortlist of words and terms to sidestep for the rest of this
    review.  I will be given five words and phrases, along with ninety seconds on the timer.  Start the clock...
    now.</p><p>
    My buzzwords are (as determined by highest journalistic prevalence): multi-instrumentalist, novelty (act),
    vaudevillian, simultaneous (ly), and one-man.</p><p>
<i>Forms and Follies</i> is the third full-length player recorded by Chicagoan Jeremy Jacobsen (better
    known as The Lonesome Organist) as well as his first release since the turn of the century.  Though it's
    not at all uncommon for a solo artist to release material under a distinct bandname or even play all of
    the instruments on an album, it is slightly more atypical for the artist to play them all simul-  er, all
    at the same time, as does Mr. Jacobsen.</p><p>
    For his latest release, he had as many as eight tracks available
    to him, which is considerably more than he had at his disposal for previous albums, but only rarely did he
    utilize more than a few.  For several songs he played drums, guitar, keys and sang; all jointly.  The
    formula alone is cause enough for concern and admittedly makes me a touch anxious.  It's all fun and games
    until somebody gets hurt.</p><p>
    The result is an eclectic, curious, seething mass of sound, sometimes delicate, often garbled and rough,
    and frequently meandering to the point of disenfranchisement.  That he's a singular musical talent with
    a unique vision isn't debatable.  The payoff, however, is.  A large portion of the disc, though interesting
    and tastefully unconventional, is devoid of any real compulsion or atmospheric engagement, and is rendered
    a mere curiosity with multiple listens.  Songs like ""The Multiplier"", a two-minute, frenetic organ-driven
    track, feel like thirty second interludes gone a minute-and-a-half too long.  In fact, much of the material
    on the disc feels a bit too much like filler.</p><p>
    The album's more structurally cognizant moments, such as the jazzy, upbeat ""The Moped"", reminiscent of his
    earlier, more (comparatively) inhibited work with 5ive Style and Euphone, provide the strongest material.
    The above track is marked by a compelling series of track-long drum rolls and fills and a frugal bassline,
    and is abetted by digressive but nifty keys and fulgent chimes.  A few tracks have vocals, and two are
    actually sans-instrumentation altogether; Doo-wop tributes that hearken back to a time more suited to our
    anachronistic Lonesome Organist.</p><p>
    Just as <i>Les Miserables</i> is far better served by the stage then as a cinematic vehicle for Claire Danes,
    The Lonesome Organist can be most appreciated in a live setting where his physical urgency and arresting
    compositions are best underscored.  His one-m, his, uh... his unaccompanied live performances have received
    widespread encomium and are said to be the best judge of his musical merit.  Unfortunately, you can't burn
    visceral engrossment or artistic perspiration on to a compact disc, and for this, <i>Forms and Follies</i>
    suffers.</p></div>"|4838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4838-forms-and-follies/|5.2|Bill Morris

    record is a tactile experience.  Like drops of water caught by a strobe light or slivers of ice ready to
    melt to water, these electronic sounds are tensing on the edge of tangibility: you can almost feel them as
    they pour through your fingers.  Nordheim once based a work around the image of a solitaire diamond, and
    here, too, his compositions shimmer like stones of unmeasured preciousness.</p><p>
    The arch clarity and profound body of the sounds give no sign that these works are over thirty years old.
    <i>Dodeka</i> is the third Rune Grammofon release to champion and resurrect the works of Arne Nordheim.
    For a man who's often praised as Norway's greatest living composer, Nordheim started his career by pushing
    his country to keep up with him. He first discovered electronic music in Paris in the mid-50s, but back
    home, musicians were refusing to play new music; reportedly, Oslo's Trinity Church actually <i>forbid</i>
    the organ works of György Ligeti.  Over the next decade, as a composer and critic, Nordheim challenged his
    country's conservative establishment to accept new music.</p><p>
    That's a battle he won a long time ago.  He's earned renown in Norway and abroad, not only for innovative
    electronic music, but for acoustic works like the striking ""Aftonland"", for soprano and chamber ensemble,
    and ""Greening"", commissioned in 1973 by the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra.  (Serious Nordheim explorers
    can run through the full range of his work on the staggering seven-disc box set <i>Listen: The Art of Arne
    Nordheim</i>, on Aurora.)  And as much as he rebelled against demands to write more ""folklorist"" music, he
    doesn't shy away from local attachments: he's written for the Oslo City Hall Carillon, and ""OHM"" features
    the valley-sweeping bellows of a Norwegian mountain horn.</p><p>
    Rune Grammofon has focused on reviving his electronic works, and 1998's <i>Electric</i> dug up major works
    like ""Solitaire"" and ""Colorazione"" that were barely available for the past thirty years.  By contrast, the
    twelve pieces on <i>Dodeka</i> have never been released.  Nordheim's brief liner notes talk about them more
    than anything in sentimental terms, describing them as ""too resonant to forget.""  The album documents a key
    part of his career, but <i>Dodeka</i> is also deeply engrossing for its obsessive refinement, and its
    subtle emotional depth.</p><p>
    Even if I could detail the working methods and technologies that went into these pieces, it would just
    distract from how free of context they sound: from the tinkling high notes that evade tempo like a
    hand-cranked music box, to the pensive echo and boom of the deep lower tones, none of the sounds betray
    their origin or hint at any source at all.  They also defy narrative: each piece runs around three minutes,
    but in this set of miniatures certain sounds and motifs repeat from piece to piece, leading up to ""Summa"",
    where Nordheim runs them all together to get a sound like a city of alien clocks ringing different hours.</p><p>
    But although they're abstract, these works are far from dry.  A halting emotional tone-- I can't call it
    ""warmth,"" though its coolness makes it stronger-- suffuses these pieces, fractionally expressed in tense
    pauses and isolated murmurs.  Nordheim has characterized it as a ""yearning,"" and in these works he distills
    that feeling, without object or nostalgia, into an incredible purity.  And while there's much to enjoy and
    study in his technique, it's that engagement which makes the music vital-- even after so many years in the
    vault.</p></div>"|5879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5879-dodeka/|8.3|Chris Dahlen

    cash-raking style war, a soundclash to bump in your truck. Unfortunately, like with most CDs filed under
    Various Artists, The Neptunes' newest woofer-friendly venture, <i>Clones</i>, is an exercise in failing to
    be everything to everyone.</p><p>
    
    The hottest production team in music today, Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams have crafted a million dollar
    organization out of their deceptively simple beatmaking style. They've worked with everyone from Daft Punk
    to Beenie Man, and this disc is the proverbial victory lap at the peak of their success. So, as expected,
    they've drafted the very biggest stars out of their two-way pager address books to develop a venerable
    who's-who in hip-hop today.</p><p>
    
    Ironically, the biggest names fare the worst. The most established artists realize that with their level of
    notoriety, they no longer need to impress. Snoop Dogg, Ludacris and Nelly each sleepwalk through their
    performances, with beats that complement their lack of interest and lack of concern with diversifying their
    portfolios. Busta Rhymes is laced with a crisp jungle funk backdrop that samples Kraftwerk, but he also
    fails to live up to the task at hand, settling on saying the word ""ass"" about a hundred times.</p><p>
    
    Even the Star Trak artists disappoint. Rosco P. Coldchain's collaboration with Pusha T and Boo Bonic, ""Hot"",
    falls on its face, based on the incorporation of a lame barebones interpolation of the Beastie Boys' ""Paul
    Revere"" and lackluster verses from all involved. Arguably the worst song on the album, Fam-Lay comes off
    like Eazy-E on morphine on ""Rock N' Roll"", claiming he has ""so much coke, got coke in jail."" Surprising to
    see a majority of the eighth planet populace's affiliates don't share the same agenda for innovation.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, when the Neptunes step out of their accepted hip-hop box, they find their greatest success.
    The highly anticipated new N.E.R.D track naturally isn't very interesting, lyrically (""We will not be the
    losers"" is this generation's ""We Are the Champions""), but is stunning, beatwise. A laser-guided funk missile
    collides with handclaps and a pulsing bassdrum backbeat, on a spiraling trajectory towards surprisingly
    inspirational lyrics from the Clipse.</p><p>
    
    Speaking of the Clipse, they drop the best song on the album through their clever attempt to reinvent the
    success of last year's ""Grindin'"". The 'Tunes assemble the twins with Ab-Liva over a hard drum loop that's
    accented by rumbling bass, handclaps, an infrequent cellphone alert and what can only be described as a
    layer of <i>Batman</i> theme-esque horns. It stands to succeed in its purpose, primarily due to the Clipse's
    ""pastors of the church of Jay-Hova"" approach. Pusha T, in particular, impresses, claiming he ""hurries the
    'cane like Miami U"". Like ""Grindin'"" refined, pitch shifted and swallowed by the Bomb Squad, ""Blaze of Glory""
    forecasts the upcoming Clipse record as a definite must-hear.</p><p>
    
    Production is the strongest facet of this album, with The Neptunes handling all tracks with their trademark
    of being exceedingly technical in their simplicity. From the fuzz-bass and stuttering organ stabs of Kelis'
    ""Popular Thug"" to the bowling alley imperial march through nuclear winter on ""Blaze of Glory"", The Neptunes
    move all around the style map.  With other excellent appearances from Nas, Supercat, Jadakiss and Dirt
    McGirt, <i>Clones</i> manages to succeed in delivering a worthwhile listening experience without fully
    realizing the goal of an innovative star mash. The Neptunes may be at their creative, commercial and
    financial peak, but if this album is any indication, they should expect a long tenure at the top of the
    musical ladder.</p></div>"|5876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5876-clones/|7.2|Rollie Pemberton

    <i>Microminiature Love</i> had been a ridiculously obscure find-- assuming anyone
    was looking for it at all-- until its vinyl reissue last year on Destijl.  Now the
    album is experiencing its biggest push ever, thanks to Seattle powerhouse Sub Pop
    who've just given it its first-ever CD pressing.</p><p>
    
    Michael Yonkers' backstory is, frankly, intense: When he committed <i>Microminiature
    Love</i>'s seven tracks to tape in the fall of 1968, he was a four-eyed technophile
    in his late teens who'd just graduated from surf-rock to the more sinister sounds
    of the Stones, et al.  Only two years later, his career and livelihood would suffer
    a devastating blow: While working at an electronics warehouse in 1971, he was crushed
    by 2,000 pounds of computer components, severely injuring his back.  Subsequently,
    the dye used in the invasive x-ray procedures led to a degenerative condition of the
    inner lining of his spinal cord.</p><p>
    
    He managed to self-release four other Jandek-styled folk records on his own eponymous
    imprint in the 70s, but soon after shifted much of his attention to dance therapy as
    a means of easing his pain.  His condition reached an apex in the mid-90s, forcing
    him out of the live circuit entirely, but due to the attention brought his way by the
    reissuing of his music, and with the help of a homemade back brace and stand for his
    guitar, he's recently played some live dates with Wolf Eyes, Six Organs of Admittance,
    and Low.</p><p>
    
    It makes sense that he's shared bills with these black-as-night DIY noisemakers,
    washed-out acid-folkies, and blissed-out dream-poppers.  A consummate techie, Yonkers
    built and modified all of his equipment: he created two effects pedals, made one guitar
    out of two, constructed synths from childrens' toys, and chopped his Fender Telecaster
    down to a small rectangular plank to facilitate his psychedelic experiments. (He still
    uses the scaled-down Tele, which these days is held together by duct tape.)</p><p>
<i>Microminiature Love</i> put Yonkers' homemade equipment to good use: the album is
    characterized by its droning open-tunings, choppy distortion, twangy folk ministrations,
    outer-world speaker pans, and bevy of crazed fretwork.  But there's a point at which
    this record shifts from wacky historical curiosity to full-on psych-rock excellence:
    the clanging fireworks that launch the final vibrato of ""Boy in the Sandbox"" from
    gloomy minor to stratospheric noise triumph.  The song spins anti-war slogans into
    a narrative about an everyday kid who passes time with toy soldiers until outgrowing
    his ""sandbox days,"" when he discovers girls, love, an actual war, and finally, a
    ""tomb of sand.""  The song's narrative leaves an open ending as the song breaks into
    the extended, atonal epiphany.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Scat Jam"" is a deconstructed space-out that recalls Comets on Fire,
    featuring strangely out-of-left-field drum breaks, entropic wooden percussion,
    Yonkers' gleeful shouts, and Wayne Rogers' guitar-blast tectonics.  The more staid,
    midtempo garage of ""Kill the Enemy"" (another grapple with the suffocation of Vietnam)
    is buttressed by the shimmering, soft white-noise of sandy-beach radio waves; targeting
    religious self-righteousness in the face of military action, it fades along a plateau
    of pulses after Yonkers lets out a final blistering fuck-off! scream (despite his youth
    in these recordings, he sounds something like a throatier Roky Erickson howling discord
    through an acid-fried Roy Orbison).</p><p>
    
    Though some of <i>Microminiature Love</i>'s six bonus tracks drag, and not all of it is
    as moving as the more powerful moments I've pointed out, there are more than enough
    quavering wah-wah nuggets to make it a heady audio experience-- especially for fans of
    The Troggs, The Zombies, more blistery Animals, Red Crayola, Thirteenth Floor Elevators,
    and that Twisted Village stargazing vibe.  For those of us who do most of our shopping
    in thrift stores, it's these forgotten bits of a visionary history that make our
    continual searching worthwhile.</p></div>"|8863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8863-microminiature-love/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

    winterland, populated by a young boy in a knit hood. In contrast, the cover of this year's <i>Empty the
    Bones of You</i> is a pale figure thrust into a nightmarish spiral of skulls, spears, and oblivion. I'm
    wagering that Chris has been to a couple of funerals in the last two years.</p><p>
    
    While, contrary to what my first paragraph might suggest, I did actually listen to this album, the
    distinction is instructive.  Clark's last album, while not a bad album by any means, struck many as
    standard-fare Warp, the type of guy you hear on a comp and then attribute to some better known artist.
    And while the songs were better Aphex/Squarepusher tracks than the ones on either <i>Drukqs</i> and <i>Go
    Plastic</i>, they were still just Aphex/Squarepusher songs. The sole innovation was Clark's segregation of
    moods; with a few exceptions, there were happy songs and sad songs, with very little in between. It was
    classic Warp without the ambiguity, a technically virtuoso performance channeling mediocrity.</p><p>
    
    On the new album, however, Clark gains some unique ground. ""Indigo Optimos"" opens with a minimal Detroit
    techno beat, then gets trounced by some jarring cuts.  Rather than tediously layering one audio track on
    another and then peeling them off slowly at the end, he'll simultaneously put on three or four tracks for
    a bar, then get rid of them all at once, only to sample the same passage later in the song.  The result is
    haunting, and leagues more accomplished than anything on his debut.  On ""Early Mass,"" a music box gets
    stuck on a groove, grows increasingly metallic, and then gradually fades away until only a shell of the
    initial sound remains-- the erosive gives way to the evocative.  The sound is literally haunted.  Later,
    the apparition circumnavigates the original music box sample and, until ""Tyre"" comes along and drops the
    instrument into the street, the sound perfectly balances infantile calm and sophisticated mourning.</p><p>
    
    Most songs seem on the brink of collapsing completely. Each struggles to get its melody out, but is threatened
    by static, loops, and that form of antagonistic buzzing that can only be described as Basic Channel.
    ""Holiday as Brutality"" features a jazzy synth absorbed by distortion until the song starts over again on
    a lighter frequency.  The melody here is weathered, but intact.  The phenomenal ""Gravel (Obliterated)"" seems
    to rest on a dilapidated suspension bridge-- eventually the ropes fray, the planks fall, and the entire song
    just sort of drops into a static that continues into ""Gob Coitus"", which restructures the white noise and
    melody into a more subterranean atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    The album's second half flounders a bit with well-executed, but not particularly memorable pieces (""Farewell
    Track"", ""Betty""). What must have been intended as the centerpiece, the six-minute ""Wolf"", is a surprisingly
    traditional ""epic hip-hop"" instrumental (think DJ Shadow) and not nearly as impressive as the next shorter
    track, ""Slow Spines"", a potpourri of harp, grated cheese, robot handclaps, and whistling. While Chris Clark
    has found his voice on this album and will, in all likelihood, become a household name on par with the Warp
    flagships, he hasn't yet recorded his masterpiece. Still, there's an ambition in this stuff that was absent
    in <i>Clarence Park</i>-- one that will surely make this Best Promising Sophomore Album sometime in the
    near future.</p></div>"|1484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1484-empty-the-bones-of-you/|7.8|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    Robert Pollard over these long years since the broadly accepted twilight of Guided by Voices' reign over the
    (very nearly) barren kingdom of indie rock as we now know it?  The sum of all the criticism heaped on GBV
    for years (excepting <i>Do the Collapse</i>-- universally agreed upon as the absolute nadir of the band's
    catalog), all the way back to <i>Mag Earwhig!</i>, has amounted to barely more than a weak-kneed ""wait 'til
    next year.""  And we waited, and some of us are still waiting, while others have simply given up; critics
    have been crying wolf for years, so who can really blame folks for finally losing faith?</p><p>
    
    So how did he do it?  Critics, notoriously, are jackals, trying, always trying, to thin the herd, to cull the
    sick and dying at the first sign of weakness; Pollard, it would seem, has been staggering around on his last
    legs for three or four not-so-hot-to-lukewarm albums (if that sounds like revisionist history, it's only
    'cause history was wrong in the first place).  And yet he still lives!  How?  His only defense, I now
    submit to you: pure enthusiasm, a forever-young charm; I can see no other explanation.  There have been
    plenty of unlikely rock heroes, but after fifteen (!) albums, only Robert Pollard still sounds, for all the
    highs and lows, like an ex-schoolteacher trying to live the dreams of his idols, still trying to grow into
    Pete Townshend's arena-sized shoes.  Deep down, I firmly believe, even Pollard's critics want him to succeed,
    or at least would rather forget him than be forced to say he failed.</p><p>
    
    By now, you've seen the rating (go on, look) and if even the expectation of the phrase ""better than the last
    few GBV albums"" stirs only cynicism within your jaded insides, it might just be the case that you're in
    healthy working order.  As a reformed Robert Pollard apologist, I will not ask you to see the promise of
    better things to come from here or wait 'til next year; I'll go one better: <i>Earthquake Glue</i> meets
    any GBV album that isn't named <i>Bee Thousand</i> or <i>Alien Lanes</i>.  It sounds improbable, but all
    I'm asking you to believe is that Bob's year to finally make good on any incubating potential he's shown
    since the halcyon days of Tobin Sprout has finally arrived.  A ""Guided by Voices album"" has meant too much,
    for too long, to too many (and if you need reasons, I just mentioned both of them), but this isn't a normal
    GBV album.  This is Bob Pollard at his most direct, most natural, and finally ready to shake the stadiums
    down to their very foundations.</p><p>
    
    It's no secret that Bob Pollard's Who-caliber aspirations have been leaking into his work way back since he
    had a devil between his toes-- you can hear Roger Daltrey turning green with every swelling power chord of
    ""Wished I Was a Giant"" and earlier.  He's masked it for a long time with whimsically beautiful lyrics, lo-fi
    production, and generally keeping the guitar windmilling to a minimum on soft-spoken classics like ""Goldheart
    Mountaintop Queen Directory"", but it's been fully silenced.  It hardly needs to be said, but when folks
    describe you in terms like ""whimsical,"" like a Dr.Seuss character-cum-pop superstar (the main character in
    <i>Robert Hears The Who</i>), filling Madison Square Garden ain't gonna be easy, probably impossible.  But
    steadily, Bob's realized this and begun shedding the belovedly quirky trappings of his past; what's felt
    like ""falling off"" for so long was really gradual metamorphosis into a different beast entirely.</p><p>
<i>Earthquake Glue</i> differs from any past incarnation of GBV; the anthems here are realized to the fullest
    height of their earthly majesty, with no real pretense of the muddy indie aesthetic GBV helped to usher in
    out of sheer fiscal necessity more than a decade ago.  This is not the shiny, breezy pop rock and crunch of
    <i>Isolation Drills</i>; ""I'll Replace You with Machines"", ""Beat Your Wings"", ""Apology in Advance""-- these
    are smoke machines, strobe lights, and pyrotechnics.  And Bob, with his vaguely raspy, vaguely British lilt,
    sits center stage, twirling his microphone, pumping his fist with the practiced air of a rock star who truly
    has ""been around the block,"" and in a nod to his various ups and downs, ""even threw up one street over.""
    He ""keeps searching, turning on, equally frustrated,"" but without any hint of self-conscious indie antics,
    maybe no longer; whether brooding on the shiftless, railcar blues of ""Dirty Water"" or transcendent on ""Dead
    Cloud"", Pollard never struggles to find powerful vocal hooks.  It finally seems effortless.</p><p>
    
    Even more surprisingly, it doesn't sound like it's just Bob's show anymore; GBV is no longer a euphemism for
    ""Robert Pollard and his faceless, rotating cast of backing musicians""-- these guys actually sound like an
    honest-to-god-swear-on-some-bibles band.  There's actual, intangible chemistry between Doug Gillard and Nate
    Farley's explosive chords and Kevin March's cymbal washes.  Most importantly, Tim Tobias gives Pollard
    something he's lacked since <i>Alien Lanes</i>: a memorable bass melody that isn't devoured by jangling
    guitars.  Think back to ""Echoes Myron"" or ""My Valuable Hunting Knife"" and it's easy to recognize how
    necessary those basslines are; for exactly one track, Tim Tobias almost single-handedly revives the old
    magic.</p><p>
    
    ""The Best of Jill Hives"" is a GBV classic by any measure, new or old, and, like the best of Pollard's lyrical
    work, is made even more meaningful by avoiding his effective, but impenetrable, stream-of-consciousness.  ""I
    know where you get your nerve/ I know how you choose your word,"" he calls out, and like the wounded beauty
    of ""Game of Pricks"", it doesn't sound like a clever fiction, but like something that happened between real
    people.  It's a single, brilliant, bittersweet concession; contrast that ""old"" sound with the sheen of
    ""Useless Inventions"".</p><p>
    
    Some may mourn the change, but I contend that in its own way, ""Inventions"" is equally
    classic.  Endlessly catchy, as tight and triumphant as anything Pollard has ever done, this song epitomizes
    the unfettered, imaginative re-invention of GBV, immersed in the hard rock tropes Pollard has until now only
    toyed with.  Side by side (nearly), it's clear that GBV has subtly crossed over into truly uncharted (though
    nearby) territory; after playing into the same well-worn channels they've run for years, there's no more
    fuzz, no more elf-kicking to conceal Pollard's hard-rock dreams; as such, <i>Earthquake Glue</i> never
    languishes in the awkward lows that seem to plague almost everything else he's done.</p><p>
    
    In the end, it's fitting that the idea of soldiers and warriors recurs throughout the skewed landscape; GBV
    has been dumbcharging at the music industry for fifteen years, and Pollard and all his various lineups have
    the battle scars to prove it.  In some ways, it's a shame that in order to revitalize the idea of GBV as a
    band it seems to have meant abandoning the very facets that made GBV a household name around only the hippest
    households so long ago, and that could be the deepest wound of all. But Pollard's perseverance has shown him
    to be a hell of a soldier, and if that cut still stings, he's not letting on.  In fact, closer to the end of
    the battle now than the beginning, he and Guided by Voices still might be a long way from filling stadiums,
    but they're not going down without a fight.</p></div>"|3595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3595-earthquake-glue/|8.5|Eric Carr

    have so neatly built inside.  Mostly, his warbling coos just feel disembodied and awkwardly appropriated,
    like a trucker hat that hasn't been properly tweaked; whereas Lee's pop contemporaries openly own and toy
    with the results of their stealthy pilfering, it's like Lee just pretends that Stevie never even happened!
    The result is karaoke-Buckley, a record full of vaguely self-indulgent vocal noodling without the grinning
    nuance required to make anybody want to roll down the windows, crinkle their nose, and yowl along.</p><p>
    
    Clocking in at a little over thirty minutes, <i>Cool Rock</i> plays like a smoothed-out, perpetually
    swooning exercise in pseudo-soulfulness.  It's not so much that Lee himself seems especially disingenuous
    or affected (although he occasionally does), it's that his songwriting has somehow disintegrated into
    shapelessness-- which, in turn, exponentially amps up the inherent sappiness of gooey soul-singing.</p><p>
    
    Lee's self-titled debut was comparably sharp and capable, with a sort of quasi-Southern, bashful charm; <i>Cool
    Rock</i> is mushy and benign, with most of the record's eight tracks lost in a haze of overwrought vocal
    cartwheeling, vague backbeats, and garrulous guitars.  Lee has gone elevator-polite, laying down the smarmy
    sentiments and boring instrumentation without the slightest bit of self-awareness.</p><p>
    
    Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley mans the drumkit for Lee (Shelley released Lee's second record, <i>Plays and
    Sings Torch'd Songs, Charivari Rhythms, and Oriki Blue-Marches</i> on his own label, Smells Like Records,
    back when Lee was still earning a shitload of half-hearted Buckley comparisons), but his musical influence
    seems pretty negligible, as Lee lumbers from adult contemporary ballads to poppy swan songs.</p><p>
    
    There are a
    handful of redeeming moments: the overdubbed horns on ""(I Was a Teenage) Symphony to God"" are so
    unselfconsciously predictable and retro-lounge that they're almost charming.  Perhaps more notably, the
    somewhat ironically titled and buried-at-the-back ""Say It Ain't Soul"" is an unquestionably solid, standout
    track-- thankfully spare instrumentation (on <i>Cool Rock</i>, less is almost always more) showcases Lee's
    undeniable vocal prowess and range, and his wails are finally pretty convincing.  Then, a few minutes later,
    the record ends.</p></div>"|4714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4714-cool-rock/|3.8|Amanda Petrusich

    that the Olympia-via-Arkansas trio churned out at a sweaty Knitting Factory gig in July of last year.
    Originally released by the band as a cassette-only edition of 50 titled <i>Non-Dead In NYC</i>, the 27-minute
    set is a boomy swath of analog noise that compliments the band's sloppy-ass, faux-naive approach to the blues.</p><p>
    The band races through material from each of their recent full-lengths, but the most immediately noteworthy
    track is the one they didn't write: a perfunctory cover of The Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"".  Over the
    years, the song has been covered (to varying degrees of shittiness) by Hüsker Dü, Uncle Tupelo, The Meat
    Puppets, Elf Power, GG Allin, Sonic Youth, Swans, The Birthday Party, and Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts, so
    it's impossible to know for sure exactly which version The Gossip are botching here.  The trio is joined
    here by GSL punks The Chromatics for one blathering five-minute jam, replete with what sounds like some Good
    Charlotte instrument-smashing to round out the punk-as-fire festivities.  It lacks nuance, though, and
    charisma-- a re-tooling of Bessie Smith or The Ramones would have made more sense contextually.</p><p>
    But before this half-ass finale gets underway, there's some valuable stuff to learn.  Initiating the set
    with a muddy strum, some tuning and banter, a splice, and finally a grindingly ho-hum ""Got All This Waiting""
    from their 2001 debut <i>That's Not What I Heard</i>, <i>Undead in NYC</i> doesn't really get going until
    the second track, ""Non, Non, Non"" (originally released on this year's <i>Movement</i> as ""No, No, No"").
    My big bitch about The Gossip's studio outings has always been the guitar's incongruent cleanliness and
    Ditto's too-upfront pop-diva vocals, so it's nice to hear the band indulging my aesthetic pipe dream:
    ""Non, Non, Non"" is an evened-out miasma of Southern-styled Tower Recordings boom.  As a bonus, the shrieking
    crowd forms ad hoc high-end percussion to the otherwise dense super-bass sound. Damn nice: this is how they
    should've sounded always.</p><p>
    ""Don't (Make Waves)"" is similarly, gloriously buried in a pile of dirt: when Ditto's voice falls farther
    back in the mix, she stretches and ducks more powerfully around the fractured feedback, hummingbird
    drumsticks, and other concrete obstacles.  Ditto remains the band's singularly unique talent, and listening
    to her notes bounce off the Knitting Factory's walls is a treat.  In fact, all the material from <i>Movement</i>
    shines, sounding more complex and intriguing than ever. On the other hand, the stuff from 2001's <i>Arkansas
    Heat</i> EP slides by like a sigh, lacking detail and succumbing to boring garage-rock tropes (even if the
    band would rather be pigeonholed as ""punk"").</p><p>
    Also worthwhile as a downtown field archive, <i>Undead in NYC</i> captures the crowd's gleeful response to
    Beth Ditto's every word. Though she doesn't actually say anything very interesting, her snotty delivery and
    joyous attitude are fun enough. Formally, a peculiar but totally interesting aspect of <i>Undead</i> is the
    gaggle of sloppily edited between-song breaks, cutting Ditto off mid-sentence or syllable and creating some
    strange juxtapositions, and the beginning of a new from-beyond-the-grave William Gaddis novel:</p><p>
<i>""So I'm looking for somebody named--""<br/>
    ""--This songs is for all the f--""<br/>
    [feedback]<br/>
    [inaudible]<br/>
    ""...proud of your fucking selves.""</i></p><p>
    These odd splices and cuts continue throughout, creating a bizarre Jackson Mac Low vibe: now if only they'd
    start chopping the songs in half and attacking obvious compositional structures.</p><p>
    Despite its boring cover choice and the less-than exciting <i>Arkansas Heat</i> material, <i>Undead in NYC</i>
    offers a few energetic, beautifully contained environmental recordings. As a whole, I'm not sure it has much
    use for anyone besides hardcore fans, oddball technophiles, or the folks who attended this particular
    performance, but The Gossip should use it as a blueprint, hire Neil Hagerty or Henry Flynt, and record
    in the future with a similarly integrated, basement hiss aesthetic.</p></div>"|3532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3532-undead-in-nyc/|6.9|Brandon Stosuy

For many, the great icon of this     quasi-imperialist dominion over the United States' vast cultural reserves is Peter Brötzmann. Ah, yes:     we see lil' Peter in Remscheid, Germany, wicker hat over his brow, a little red wagon precociously tugging     at his hand and his heart. The radio switches on: Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon.  Brötzmann meets     jazz.</p>
<p>As theories have it, after a few seconds, either the radio lost all reception at the most clangorous volume     imaginable or Brötzmann suffered a severe injury to his nervous system. No one can say. However, in hindsight,     it is irrevocably clear that when Brötzmann thought he was still partaking in classic jazz, he was now     actually listening to ten fifty-foot chainsaws attached to flaming rotor blades in the middle of a railroad     destruction derby.  And thus was born European free jazz.</p>
<p>Through the 60s and 70s, Brötzmann and a legion of similarly minded outcasts, clad in the skin ripped from     Ayler's cadaver, rode into ever-expanding rings of demonic noise.  Now a paterfamilias for the free jazz     vanguard, the sixty-year-old portrayed on this concert album recorded in Montreal on April 10th, 2001 is     even more iconoclastic, griseous, and steel-lunged. The trio (three-fourths of the Die Like a Dog Quartet)     dedicated the album to Peter Kowald, who passed away a few months after this concert. Coincidence?</p>
<p>This is a pernicious, pummeling disarray, like all of Brötzmann's albums, and he still makes time for some     significant innovations. For a woodwind who began his era of infamy with a music that had no precedents,     this particular lineup cavalierly aligns Brötzmann with a rich American tradition of frenetic and dense     hard bop (courtesy of Parker and Drake), although that doesn't nearly classify this style of playing--     concrete bop, perhaps, or black-hole-singularity bop. The instruments are still gloriously combusting all     over this show, but there's a more melancholy lyricism affixed to them. This is the first Brötzmann album--     hell, first European improv album-- that got stuck in my head hours after it had ended.</p>
<p>From the first ten seconds of the first four-part opus, ""Never Run But Go"", it's evident that this ain't your     father's avant-garde. Brötzmann's shriek of a wraith of a blow bifurcates his clarinet LIKE THE SERPENT'S     TONGUE IN EDEN. Parker starts walking up and down, occasionally allowing some tones to break asunder and     reinvigorate the clarinetist. Drake is playing the most fervent fills ever conceived, with rolls occurring     about every ten seconds. The 45-minute piece is probably one of the most accessible avant-garde jazz moments     of the last few years. This is some mad, foaming audacity, but it does have a rhythm (one not recommended for     small children or pregnant women).</p>
<p>On ""The Heart and the Bones"", an initially catastrophic lunacy suddenly goes from Parker sawing his bass in     half with the bow into a meditative and elegiac line that sounds like a vacation in Polynesia, except instead     of birds in the trees, there are amped-up coffee machines. It's perversely soothing, although I still can't     decide if Parker's riff is closer to Reich's <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i> or the <i>Crash Bandicoot</i> soundtrack. Either way, the respite is greatly appreciated. (And I use ""respite"" cautiously here; Brötzmann     is still playing at frequencies that make dogs shatter.) The second disc, while nearly as essential, is a     more traditional Brötzmann: less fills, less funk, and more carnage. The titular piece starts with some     light brushing and leads into a more ""intimate"" version of his great band works of the 70s. The final track,     ""Halfhearted Beast"", is unlike anything I've ever heard in free jazz, a blues bounce that seems to intentionally     regiment Brötzmann's sax, and I still don't know whether to take it seriously or not.</p>
<p>Brötzmann's style is one of those wondrous achievements that we hope employs digital effects, if only so we     can sleep soundly at night knowing no one has that much organic power. He typically pulverizes the horn,     blowing straight through it and consciousness. Thus, any two-disc set of his work is a little like going     to the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot twice in two hours. Pack your bags.</p></div>"|966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/966-never-too-late-but-always-too-early/|8.5|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    some well-deserved slack.  The first, ""Never Alone"", is a put-on-- a 30-second slow jam that points directly
    to a Boyz II Men poster that may lie hidden behind an old pile of <i>Ranger Rick</i> magazines in Rob's closet,
    while the second (which follows the sublime ""Beyond Him"", a sample of the type of stuff the rest of the record
    will contain) is simply a thick slice of cold uncool: its title (""Jedi Outcast"") speaks volumes, and lyrical
    tidbits like ""Jedi will crush the Sith"" might be a bit much to swallow, but it's important to note that this
    bit of sci-fi fandom is offered in the form of a heavy metal dirge-- double-time bridge included.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, if Rob gave a rat's ass about looking cool for all the kiddies, he'd shelve such excursions and
    offer more of the low-key acoustic four-track chicanery that fills the rest of this disc.  But then, why stop
    there?  Why not cut that song about being a fucking robot (""Kill All the Humans"") or that dreamy, reverb-happy
    track about the helicopter (""Helicopter"")?  What next-- drop the song with the Foo Fighter drumbeat about
    hating your job (""Overtime"")?  Introduce the cutting room floor to ""Catching the Trap"", a stop-and-go track
    that slaps together frantic strumming and leisurely picking?</p><p>
    
    The way I see it, liking Rob Crow means taking the good with the bad-- if you're going to groove along to the
    typewritten pop of ""Some Things"" and the somber meditations of ""Finger"" and <i>especially</i> the contagious
    beat of ""A Subtle Kiss"", you'll have to accept that Rob's an unabashed <i>Star Wars</i> fan and that he wants
    to share his 80s boy-band homage with you.  Crow's ideas come fast and furious, and it's better to give them
    voice and let them hit the air than squelch them for fear of them sucking.  Yeah, it's a mess, but it's a
    glorious, expansive one.  Folks that want a more concise and less willfully idiosyncratic Rob Crow can listen
    to Pinback; the rest of us willing to dig for diamonds will do just fine getting dirty with this.</p></div>"|1712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1712-my-room-is-a-mess/|7.2|David Raposa

<center>
</center><pre>
    02   65:08
    </pre></p><p>
    
    On my discman that means two tracks that total 65 minutes. In the instant
    when I see that display and crunch those numbers, certain questions
    inevitably come to mind: How is this person going to keep me interested for
    30-minutes at a stretch? What are they going to be <em>doing</em> with all
    that space? How many times in my life am I going to hear the final five
    minutes of those 30-minute pieces?</p><p>
    
    Well, on <i>Beautiful Blood</i>, Daniel Menche (who has released a lot of
    albums I haven't heard) does a wonderful job keeping me engaged over pair
    of his half-hour tracks. Menche's music is built around drones that stand
    tall and stretch deep and wide-- drones like that need a lot of time to
    develop.  Shrinking these things down to pop song lengths (or even 10-minute
    slabs) would be like trying to condense a season of <i>The Sopranos</i> down
    to a two-hour feature film. Menche is working the long form.</p><p>
    
    As you might guess from the album title and cover that borrows its sinister
    ""red forest at night"" motif from Gas' <i>Zauberberg</i>, Menche's drones tend
    toward darkness. The first track is a messy braid of artificially held piano
    chords, sampled strings, bass pedals, and whirring noise machines, and his
    patient sense of timing as he introduces new textures ensures continued
    engagement. Though it seems quite static on one level, the first track
    actually changes almost constantly, so that any one 10-second segment is
    noticeably different from the ones that surround it. It builds an impressive
    head of steam, becoming noisier and harsher until it eventually leads to a
    single banged piano chord-- the same place the track began.</p><p>
    
    The second track shuffles the deck a bit, using some of the same elements
    (with the interesting addition of the endlessly stretched human vocals
    favored by Popol Vuh on <i>In Den Garten Pharaos</i>) while adopting a
    more minimal vibe focusing on held tones. The build happens even slower
    and the tone is less foreboding and more reflective. It still works, but
    if I were to get bored of <i>one</i> of these tracks eventually it would
    definitely be the second one. It requires a level of concentration and
    involvement that I rarely have. But this afternoon in the park I was able
    to give <i>Beautiful Blood</i> my full attention as I laid on the grass.
    It was an hour well spent.</p></div>"|5549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5549-beautiful-blood/|7.2|Mark Richardson

    all brothers (except for the one that's a cousin), raised by a Pentecostal preacher who traveled the South
    feeding them roots-rock and the Lord's word in equal measure. It's the sort of tale that many in the music
    press lap up because it plays into rock's need for a linear history, and because it has roots in the history
    of rock, blues, country and many of America's established musical legends.  So next to Jack White's
    anti-technology screeds, Kings of Leon have the rock press' most beloved non-image image. They so come
    across like a fictionalized version of What Rock Is Supposed To Be circa 1973 that they could pass for
    Stillwater.</p><p>
    
    Kings of Leon can't be faulted for their reviews, nor should they be judged by their appearance.  Hell, rock
    needs more characters and personalities.  It needs more people who aren't afraid to look foolish or to reach
    for greatness and potentially fail. The willingness to take chances and to do something truly different has
    been slowly bled out of rock by safe careerism. Most bands get one shot in the studio every two years to
    maintain or grow their fanbase, and too often seem reluctant to confound expectations.  It's frustrating,
    then, that Kings of Leon's debut, <i>Youth and Young Manhood</i>, seems to be about removing any possibility
    that the band could put a wrong foot forward.  Their bar band approach sounds as if they've taken a book of
    rock history and, dutifully following along, bookmarked some of the most unremarkable passages.</p><p>
    
    Their music is often referred to as Southern Rock, although it doesn't rock at all-- it lacks force, velocity,
    and power. It also has little in common with a lot of what of the best Southern Rock had; it doesn't display
    the craftsmanship and technical proficiency of the Allman Brothers, the anthemism and storytelling of Lynyrd
    Skynyrd, nor the eccentricity of Little Feet. More accurately, Kings of Leon sound as if they're aiming more
    to ape the blues-inflected Rolling Stones, The Faces, or early Bob Seger. Unfortunately, without the dexterity
    or ferocity of any of them, they end up closer to the likes of Foghat, Black Oak Arkansas, or The Doobie
    Brothers.</p><p>
    
    It's all very disappointing, because blues-rock can still be powerful when its purveyors demonstrate charisma,
    quirk, muscle, and a penchant for hooks.  <i>Youth and Young Manhood</i>'s opener, ""Red Morning Light"", with
    its gritty, minimalist stomp, could pass for the White Stripes, but elsewhere, Kings of Leon stagger from
    CBGB junkie blues (""Trani"") to Led Zeppelin-lite (""Joe's Head"") to a muddy, sluggish take on AC/DC (""Spiral
    Staircase"").  ""Happy Alone"" is the album's strongest track and-- thanks to the clipped guitar and singer
    Calen Followill's garbled, slow drawl and indecipherable lyrics-- the one that most justifies all of the
    ""Southern Strokes"" tags.  Followill's voice has an element of gravely confidence, yet it off-puttingly
    carries the ugly sense of entitlement of young machismo.</p><p>
    
    Like Fountains of Wayne or The Stereophonics, Kings of Leon aim to meet your every expectation to a T, and
    nothing more, making music that's seemingly bulletproof simply because it's built on the foundation of the
    way things were done in the good ol' days.  Which is much of this band's problem: Kings of Leon attempt to
    substitute their supposed possession of ""honesty,"" ""purity,"" ""realism,"" ""history"" and ""authenticity"" for
    ideas, hooks and songs.  And like so many bands touted as bearing these intangible, inaudible sensations,
    they simply aim for pantomime, careful not to reach for anything other than the tried-and-true simply because
    that's perceived as the ""right"" way to do things.</p></div>"|4558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4558-youth-and-young-manhood/|4.2|Scott Plagenhoef

The new book ""Spectres of Inheritance"" 
    (by Chrisott McAcademic; Gerd University Press; $22) points out with zesty dread that the eighties were a bad prequel for now, a phantom menace in tapered britches: 
    we are re-fraught with eighties fads, toys, celebrities, design, and fashion. We're also cylically dolloping attention on things that never left, the profiles of which seemed 
    to zenith under Reagan and Elderbush: empires, evil, AIDS, Africa, cocaine, and turning outer space into either a minefield or an Ultimate Laser Tag. And of course, 
    <i>Ferris Bueller's Decade Off</i> haunts music in ways wonderful (turn on the Lite Brites again, please, Interpol) and ways heinous (that payola-punk band the Colecos 
    covering Glenn Frey). Orwell deserves to win another golden Prescie from the Hindsight/Foresight Institute: whether or not calling his war-peace surveillance-conformity 
    epic 1984 was his idea, he even nailed the year during which so many subtly totalitarian seeds got sown. He didnt predict pop's culpability, though, in helping us ignore 
    global crises. Surely CNN will soon announce which sweet primetime slot will be held by Huey Lewis and The Evening News. Surely the Department of Homeland 
    Security will soon announce that it is training an elite unit of <i>Ghostbusters</i>.</p><p>
    
    Anyway, dont buy this Thick Pigeon reissue unless you love post-Warhol sub-glam absurdist-meets-infantile eighties-underground New York-ness, or if you're not a 
    feigned-erection-via-Jello-Pudding-Pops-splint (remember Cosby? you named your goldfish Theo? AWESOME) completist of a] New Order (two members play here)
    b] Sonic Youth (that's a young Kim Gordon's former bandmate singing, and Thurston Moore guests on ""Pope"") c] atrocious-Tony-Wilson hair-era Factory (this was 
    Fact85 and Factus16, with a seven-inch and compilation track added), d] filmscore genius (the music here is by the man who soul-blowingly soundtracked the snowy 
    car approach that begins <i>Fargo</i>).</p><p>
    
    More a project than a band, Thick Pigeon was Stanton Miranda (Durutti Column guest vocalist, Jonathan Demme actress, and blasphemer of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" on the 
    awful Virgin anti-tribute <i>A Means To An End</i>-- her version sounds like Belly on herbal ritalin) and Carter Burwell (composer for almost every Coen Brothers film, as well as <i>Psycho 
    3</i>, to which Miranda also contributed). Their music is minimalist but spacious, and though the ingredients for dance tracks are in the house, the songs are wallflowers teeming 
    with art-faggy whimdulgence. After the first three tracks, Thick Pigeon loses the listener's hope. I know theyre not suposed to be fettered to logic, but even as free-range confections, 
    Miranda's lyrics make as much sense as a dumbwaiter on a pontoon. Burwell clearly cares more about atmosphere than rhythm: his moody keys suggest a sci-fi Satie, but 
    the handclappy beats are rote-- were Ciccone Youth spoofing this album?</p><p>
    
    With the exception of the Ladytron-like jam ""Fred + Andy"", on which Miranda softens her warble-burp-chant, the original <i>Too Crazy Cowboys</i> sounds fronted by a prematurely 
    aged Punky Brewster (though ""Jeff + Bart"" would work without an album around it, as an oddity, as it mixes Miranda's unsinging and unlyrics captivatingly, with tingly anthemic 
    synths and quaintly outdated robot voices). The three bonus tracks are the re-release's keepers: clubbier, they take David Byrne's limp white funk and Factory-ize it (echoes,

    its end is this eighties revisitation not flukily miserable or befuddlingly lurchy. To quote eighties icon Lloyd Bentsen (the first line of <i>Donnie Darko</i>, you'll remember, is about 
    voting for Dukakis) : ""I knew Yaz. Yaz was a friend of mine. Thick Pigeon, youre no Yaz.""</p></div>"|8236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8236-too-crazy-cowboys/|2.1|William Bowers

    ballrooms of 1940s Hollywood and the sparking mechanization of an automobile factory, but Weilheim, Germany's
    Tied &amp; Tickled Trio have managed to make one.  On <i>Observing Systems</i>, Duke Ellington travels back to
    the future, electric Miles discovers the glitch, and Gil Evans collides head-on with Lee Perry.  Don't let
    the goofy bandname throw you, by the way-- this is heady music by accomplished musicians (most of which are
    either members or associates of The Notwist).  Also, they're not really a trio, typically arranging their
    music for twice that many musicians.</p><p>
    
    Tied &amp; Tickled Trio is officially a side project for all involved, but it honestly holds up against recent
    offerings from The Notwist and Lali Puna quite well, lending a keen focus to the jazz leanings explored by
    the former band on 1998's <i>Shrink</i>.  This is actually the Trio's fourth full-length of slippery
    electronic jazz, and they've gotten successively better as time has passed, this time choosing to augment
    organic performances with dub and mechanical flourishes.  The album opens with a deep, dark blend of horns
    and sax, tinged with just a hint of device-generated incandescence.  It's remarkably similar in mood to some
    of Duke Ellington's humid extended compositions, though it's fair to say that these northern Europeans don't
    have quite as much swing as your average Ellington band.</p><p>
    
    ""The Long Tomorrow"" is well-placed at the start of the record, as it's probably the band's most stunning
    moment to date.  From that dark horn intro, simple drum rhythms carry intricate horn counterpoint forward to
    a dramatic climax, when the drums add a double-time pulse and the horn builds to a frenzied, dissonant wail.
    Ultimately, the band breaks into solos, gradually playing more freely and out of the pocket while an ominous
    bass rhythm creeps in from the back.  It's got Mingus written all over it-- a great tribute not only to the
    man's music, but also to his fiery personality.</p><p>
    
    The most notable instrumental standout is Johannes Enders, who lets rip with his tenor on ""Bungalow"", playing
    the sax for its full range and breathing in a way that emphasizes the acoustic properties of the instrument's
    interior-- you can feel the air moving through the brass tube.  The record is filled with dense, vibrant horn
    textures throughout, and it's a treat to hear how these textures blend with harsh programmed snares and hi-hats,
    as well as the deep dub echo that swallows some cuts.</p><p>
    
    There are moments when the band allows the mix of live and programmed percussion take the spotlight, such as
    the comparatively sparse ""Like Armstrong &amp; Laika"", a tribute to the first man on the moon and the first dog
    in space (though it could as easily be read as an homage to a jazz legend and a contemporary trip-hop group),
    or the locked beat of ""Motorik"", which features a buried, but rather frenzied solo from Enders, processed to
    sound almost like a violin.  Closer ""Henry and the Ghosts"" slips between flute-led horn arrangements and a
    haunted, creaking piano interlude where brief classical figures cry out from an abyss of echo.</p><p>
    
    Despite its ambitious blurring of genres, <i>Observing Systems</i> feels utterly natural, which is probably
    due in part to the fact that the band is really a no-pressure situation for its members.  The only reason
    this band exists is because its members are too creatively restless to sit still between albums by their
    other bands.  How fortunate that we should benefit from that restlessness.</p></div>"|8234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8234-observing-systems/|8.3|Joe Tangari

    time.  Certainly there are some great scores out there: Nina Rota's work for Fellini, Bernard Herrmann's amazing music for Hitchcock and Stanley
    Kubrick's survey of modern classical music for his own pictures are a few of my favorites.  However, generally I think soundtracks are written as
    supporting roles rather than feature attractions, and taken on their own, that doesn't always equate to a gripping performance for listeners.  Jason
    Swinscoe, leader of the UK post-fusion, part-time IDM outfit Cinematic Orchestra, certainly knows how to enhance a mood (witness his moonlighting
    as a DJ and remixer), but on this set of vignettes-- all recorded in 1999-- he usually settles for pleasant nothings.</p><p>
    
    Unlike last year's surprisingly lively <i>Every Day</i>, wherein Swinscoe passed up noir-jazz tastefulness for edgy expressionist, post-Ayler extroversions, <i>Man
    With a Movie Camera</i> catches his project in a much more conservative mode.  Swinscoe's soundtrack for director Dziga Vertov's 1929 silent documentary of
    the same name plays it smooth for the most part, using muted James Brown funk beats and the occasional dash of electronic sheen as the spice in an
    otherwise minimal, contemplative brew.  Not having seen the film (also recently released on DVD with this accompanying soundtrack), I can't really
    say how well his pieces complemented scenes of the young Russian workers only 12 years into an unprecedented way of life.  I'll give him the benefit
    of the doubt that he was able to make acid-jazz work, though you have to wonder how old Vertov would have felt.</p><p>
    
    As with many soundtracks, I often get the sense here that things are kept at an even, not-terribly-intrusive keel in order to support whatever might be
    happening onscreen-- and as a result, they don't necessarily work very well as stand-alone listening experiences.  Sure, I'm free to let the theater of
    the mind have its way with this music, but as sparse, ""evocative"" music goes, these guys have little on, say, Stereolab (or a Martin Denny record
    for that matter).  When the Orchestra plays it ""cool,"" as on the reprise of their cover of the Art Ensemble of Chicago's ""Theme de Yoyo"", they come
    perilously close to playing background music that might even go unnoticed by the guys in the band.  Drummer Luke Flowers and reedist Tom Chant do an
    admirable job of keeping things afloat on the slow, cocktail funk simmer, as electric piano and Phil France's bass make sure everything stays in its
    right place-- yet, without a climax, or any obvious direction, the tune meanders.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, on pieces like ""Postlude"", where Flowers' expert 2-step beat and the spooky pluck of strings give straight cop-show melodrama a hip edge, the
    blunt club of repetition and lack of dynamic arc suck the life out of it.  Swinscoe again injects subtle electronics, and even vinyl scratching into
    the mix for color, but I'd argue those elements are actually too subtle and that in general, the album could have benefited from a punchier production.
    As such, the titles that work best are the ones forgoing upbeat energetics entirely for atmospherics.  ""Russian Record"" uses marimbas and a rainy-day
    string arrangement, perhaps as perfect accompaniment to the dour, never-changing routine of the average Russian worker.  The simple, but
    effectively wry chorus of violins on ""Reel Life"" does wonders for its clumpy, mid-tempo funk shuffle-- Cinematic Orchestra play ""sophisticated""
    well.</p><p>
    
    Since these pieces were recorded in several years ago, anyone curious about the further development of Swinscoe and company will have to wait.  It's
    clear that their adventures in support of the big screen have gotten more engaging over the years, though melodically and texturally, <i>Man With a
    Movie Camera</i> is pretty consistent with the rest of the band's catalog.  Still, I would recommend anyone start with <i>Every Day</i> and work backwards as
    far as hitting their best stuff first.  This isn't a bad album, but should almost certainly work better with something else happening.</p></div>"|1468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1468-man-with-a-movie-camera/|6.0|Dominique Leone

    exactly like that kind of band: polished, palatable, and boasting the quasi-confident swagger that comes from nabbing three number-
    one records in your homeland but enjoying relative anonymity almost everywhere else-- especially the market-saturated States.  Because 
    despite some fairly rousing recommendations from members of Sonic Youth (Lee Renaldo helped produce their 1993 debut, <i>Sound As Ever</i>, 
    which, curiously, was recorded in Canon Falls, Minnesota) and smiley kudos from the kids in Soundgarden and the Strokes, You Am I 
    have suffered a Robbie Williams-style, collective ""Eh?"" from insular American listeners since the band's inception over a decade 
    ago.  It's weird, because on <i>Deliverance</i>, their fifth full-length, You Am I seem so blatantly influenced by elements of classic, early 
    70s Americana-rock and moody, southeastern alt-country that it's hard to imagine their songs being more instantly applicable to any 
    other landscape.</p><p>
    You Am I's questionable band name is fairly funny in the proper context (it was plucked from the well-wet mouth of a rambling fan 
    who was caught spouting broad philosophical treatises at a YAI show), but that's not especially helpful to anyone without a press 
    kit or band biography.  Instead, You Am I bank on the songwriting proficiency of frontman Tim Rogers, who consistently crafts catchy 
    rock songs with big, singalong choruses and easily air-guitarable riffs.</p><p>
    For the most part, You Am I are a noodle-heavy outfit willing to take the occasional detour toward catchy pop hooks or porch-country 
    bellows.  <i>Deliverance</i> evidences all of the band's sonic tendencies, from acoustic ballads to modern rock singles to wild electric romps, 
    brought to fruition-- the record is a varied, occasionally scattered bit of tight-pants guitar rock in the grand tradition of 
    albums by the Black Crowes, or, in the band's better moments, the Allman Brothers. You Am I don't break much new ground here, but 
    <i>Deliverance</i> is still a solid showcase for Rogers' innate songwriting knack, and a carefully crafted, well-realized rock record. </p><p>
    ""One Trick Tony"" sees Rogers' high, straining vocals and ample wah-wah swinging back and forth, boisterous and bluesy; ""The Wrong Side 
    Now"" is a gentle acoustic lament, subdued and sweet (check the acoustic breakdowns and shimmery chimes!) ""Nifty 'Lil Number Like 
    You"" is all country twang, dynamic vocal teasing, and foot-tapping prances. </p><p>
    Mostly, You Am I just seem oddly well-suited for a Cameron Crowe soundtrack (seriously, think Jason Lee and <i>Almost Famous</i>' 
    Stillwater) or for filling an amphitheater on a late and lazy summer afternoon.  The world might not be in desperate need of more 
    proficiently played, bluesy rock and roll, but, you know, here it is.</p></div>"|8857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8857-deliverance/|7.1|Chris Dahlen

    titular blue dog, used to host <i>Blue's Clues</i>, the insanely popular children's show on Nickelodeon.
    And yes, Steve Drozd of The Flaming Lips backs him on this album, with the bulk of production duties held
    down by Lips producer Dave Fridmann.  The indie A-list backing hasn't made much of a dent in the guy's
    street cred, though-- it seems everyone's been gunning for the guy to fall flat on his face. <i>Nobody</i>
    wants to acknowledge this album.  I can't blame them-- the guy's impossible to watch.  I had some trouble,
    myself, swallowing that this character with doofus hair (guy should pay Moe Howard's estate royalties for
    that shit) had gained affiliation with one of the best bands going today, in indie rock or otherwise.</p><p>
    
    But doubts about Burns' talents are dashed instantly, with the phenomenal opener ""Mighty Little Man"", a
    colossal wallop of orchestral guitar-pop that's leagues beyond most of Fridmann's recent production work.
    It's perhaps the best example of Burns' lyrical style, relaying the tale of a television addict who transforms
    (under mysterious circumstances) into a superhero.  Recent Lips material aside, space-rocking epics of this
    sort aren't the most original thing going these days, but you'd have to be a hardened cynic to deny the
    track's ebullience-- over a year since I first heard it, I'm still surprised at its grandeur.</p><p>
    
    Burns falters slightly on ""Maintain"", which, for all its catchiness, dives into dreadful Jack Johnson-ish
    plucked acoustic territory at its outset.  The song's mindless hippie jauntiness is thankfully ameliorated
    by Drozd's trademark drumming and a sparkling chorus, but even these assets can't save the unfortunate
    lyrics, which go so far as to steal a line from obvious influence They Might Be Giants: ""And I'm standing on
    the corner/ Gonna jump out of my skin/ Gonna float above the buildings/ See which one you're in.""</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, Burns regains his composure with the symphonic, sweeping cello and trumpet of the tentatively
    optimistic ""Stick Around"" and the loose, airy guitar workout of ""Super Strings"".  Elsewhere, an upbeat,
    likeable slice of indie-pop called ""What I Do on Saturday"" ambles along in definitie Lips-like fashion,
    while ""&gt;1"" stands out as a plaintive downtempo number.  Featuring standard-issue Fridmann backing effects--
    subtly whirring synthesizers and gauzy strings-- the song works a surprisingly swampy guitar solo into the
    song's intimate environs.</p><p>
    
    Many will surely grouse that <i>Songs for Dustmites</i> succeeds only thanks to Burns' star collaborators.
    But while Drozd and Fridmann's influence is undeniable from the start (they're clearly responsible for a
    good deal of the album's sparkle), Burns' lyrical insight and gift for writing and arranging endlessly
    listenable pop songs consistently manages to steal the show.  Given the Flaming Lips' penchant for animal
    costumes and general childlike weirdness, it's no shock that these guys chose to record with Burns-- the
    surprise here is that, rather than the update of Fred Rogers' ""Won't You Be My Neighbor"" many indie snobs
    might have been expecting, <i>Songs for Dustmites</i> manages to remain true to Burns' legacy as a nice-guy
    kid's show host despite having made an unabashedly adult record that deals with familiar themes of love and
    loss.</p></div>"|1065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1065-songs-for-dustmites/|7.8|Brad Hurst

If Cannibal Ox is a new-age EPMD
    and El-P is a one-man Public Enemy, S.A. Smash is the black Beastie Boys. Def Jux has been pushing S.A. Smash
    as the underground's answer to the city walkers, the music we (and we alone!) could get jiggy to, waving our
    Aesop Rock wristbands in the air with reckless abandon. But there's a problem with this theory: the underground's
    purpose was to be the other side of the balance beam, the hip-hop with a message. S.A. Smash's message seems
    tailor-made for New York radio, except for the fact that they are fucking terrible at rapping.</p><p>
    
    Similar gruff voice, bouncy cadence and narrow subject matter bind them together as the Smash Brothers.
    These two emcees are the sound of 106 &amp; Park ambition. It's no surprise that they're from the same crew
    as Copywrite, as the lyrics are all about how dope they are, how much they love vagina and how much they
    could kick your ass. It's boring, derivative and lacking of the main factor that makes commercial rap
    enjoyable: the rainbow of emotions and situations touched on. These guys are all good times and no backlash.</p><p>
    
    The reason this album doesn't work is because they don't have the emotional severity and nonchalant allure
    of commercial artists, they don't have the intelligence and song structure of underground artists, and they
    can't write a chorus to save their lives. Choruses range from painful (""You're a Robot, where's my people?/
    You're a systematic format and you're lethal!"") to bizarre (off-key crooning in the tradition of Cappadonna
    and ODB: ""Man, I know this seems weird to you/ We're the only niggaz in the room!"") to song-destroying
    (horribly failed faux-Parliament ""ooh's"" and ""ahh's""). All the songs could just be condensed into one single
    sentient song.</p><p>
    
    The main thing you'll notice off the bat is that S.A. Smash have a penchant for getting monstrously overshadowed.
    Cage, the dope rapper that no one will admit to liking, rapes the opener ""Smash TV"" (""Turn on the TV, smash
    the S.A., with an I-N-S-A-N-E/ heaters smoke until his lungs empty""), Vast Aire beats the home team at their
    own game on ""Slide On 'Em"" (""Computer nerds, life is bigger than iMac/ That's why, backstage, with your girl,
    I mack!"") and Aesop ""The Drawing Point"" Rock brings out a brilliant road sex narrative on ""Love to Fuck"" (""She's
    grabbing at the car keys, I pull over to the shoulder, stop sudden/ A second later, we're both riding shotgun"").
    This is the sound of a show being stolen.</p><p>
    
    ""Ain't shit worse than a waste of talent,"" the chorus on ""Illy"" exclaims. Ironic that this song boasts the
    only El-P beat. But maybe I'm being too hard. Camu Tao is a rapper with a massive amount of potential, as
    evidenced on his solo 12-inch banger ""Move the Crowd"". I mean, seriously, it's not like they sampled Led
    Zeppelin or something.</p><p>
    
    OH WAIT, THEY FUCKING DID. ""Last Night"" steals ""The Ocean"" in a manner slightly more heinous than Puffy
    ripping off ""Kashmir"". See, Puffy doesn't have any common sense. Stealing is expected from someone like
    him. But as an artist that has clearly been staring at the industry for ages, Camu should know better than
    to jack a rock standard.</p><p>
    
    Regardless, the beats are a bright spot on the toilet in this instance. Tao has a level of production talent
    where he can shoot out moderately chopped club bangers like Ecstasy pills to inebriated girls. Their
    composition is still somewhat sloppy, forgettable and uninspired, but they still get the job done. Overall,
    the best drops are by El-Producto (the mindblowing, multi-layered guitar assault ""Illy""), Blockhead (the
    smooth funk on ""Love to Fuck"") and Przm (the slow-motion saloon bass funk of ""I Know What You're Thinking"").</p><p>
    
    An interesting point can be made that Camu uses the same sample on ""Spot Tonight"" that Kanye West blessed
    Freeway with on ""Hear the Song"" earlier this year. Comparing the two beats shows the huge valley of talent
    within and the fact that the commercial world has already made this album with a higher level of quality and
    polish. Hopefully they can make like the Beastie Boys, leave Russ-El and join a label where they can expand
    into the environment that they so obviously feel they belong.</p></div>"|7711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7711-smashy-trashy/|4.2|Rollie Pemberton

The occasionally jarring transitions between the house tracks     and the jazz bits bothered some people, but I thought they worked despite the vastly different production.     In addition to just sounding good mashed up against each other, I enjoyed listening for threads that ran     through the tracks in an attempt to understand Herbert's base-level preoccupations regardless of genre.     Herbert is a house producer but also a fine pianist, having studied since he was a kid, and he has a serious     affection for elegance.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and <i>Bodily Functions</i> was built in part from sampled sounds of the human body. Mustn't forget     that, with Herbert, there is always a concept.  That his records still sound great even if you don't know     what's happening or why (the Radio Boy release <i>The Mechanics of Deconstruction</i> might be the exception     here) is a testament to his vast talent. Your average music listener isn't going to log on to magicandaccident.com     to read a 3,000-word screed on Herbert's methods. They want something that sounds good when they're cleaning     the apartment. And Herbert is careful to deliver on that level-- at least with music he expects you to pay     money for. The overlapping layers of concept and commentary are an additional benefit, something to pry     apart and analyze after the music has stopped.</p>
<p>Herbert's latest project ups the stakes in every imaginable way. <i>Goodbye Swingtime</i> (which has yet to     find U.S. distribution) finds him broadening the aspects of his music that already set him apart from the     electronic music community. Where on <i>Bodily Functions</i> he wrote music for a small jazz combo, the     Matthew Herbert Big Band is a unit with four trumpets, four trombones, and four saxes, along with Herbert's     piano, bass and drums. The Big Band developed out of an invitation to assemble a group for performance at the     Montreaux Jazz Festival. Ultimately, Herbert wrote the tunes, worked with arranger Pete Wraight to realize     the harmonic structure, recorded the band live, and then mixed and manipulated the results on computer.</p>
<p>Of course, the ""big band in a digital mood"" idea isn't enough, and Herbert has his theoretical preoccupations.     He indicates in his notes that ""The conceptual back bone of the album is political literature."" Books by Noam     Chomsky, Michael Moore and others are rustled, tapped and otherwise made to sound without benefit of the     actual words within. Sounds of a printing press, Herbert's own inkjet printer, and a rally against the war     with Iraq make appearances elsewhere. Herbert also invited listeners to send him recordings of their local     telephone books being dropped to the floor, in an attempt to build a collective howl from the noise made by     literally millions of individual names (I wonder if I'm in there somewhere?). A heavily layered concept,     even by Herbert's standards.</p>
<p>Truthfully, though I've read some of his suggested reading and have an interest in Herbert's politics, I     haven't been able to integrate his concept into my reception of the music on this record. And it doesn't     really matter. What I hear on <i>Goodbye Swingtime</i> is a well-written, creatively arranged big band album     that becomes breathtaking when the acoustic elements break down and reassemble themselves, which doesn't     happen <i>quite</i> enough for my liking. Far more interesting than the subliminal far-left rhetoric are     the subtle and surprising manipulations Herbert manages to integrate into the sound of the band.</p>
<p>With Herbert it's all of a piece; every gesture is politicized but the music itself never preaches.  The     listener decides which content to absorb, and I'm most impressed by how the song ""Fiction"" slowly transforms     \xBE of the way through from a punchy, brassy pop arrangement worthy Doc Severinson into funk a la The Dirty     Dozen Brass Band and then finally into a short section of completely cut and programmed beats that retain     the same rhythmic thrust. The way all this goes down in approximately 90 seconds is astounding.</p>
<p>Picking up the ball, ""The Three W's"" uses a looped section of the aforementioned printing press' metallic     grind as a perfect percussion motif, like this is what Gil Evans would be doing now if he'd held on a little     longer.  The drama in ""The Battle"", which feels like several separate but related tunes warring for thematic     dominance, is heightened further when the meticulously voiced harmonies dissolve from something arranged to     something played by a lone man with his hand on a mouse.</p>
<p>Not all the interesting breaks involve digital manipulations. ""Chromoshop"" pauses halfway through for Herbert     to insert a few bars of solo piano dripping with the lyricism of Vince Guaraldi. But for all of Herbert's     production and editing brilliance, sometimes the vocal end of things on <i>Goodbye Swingtime</i> is a bit     less successful. ""The Three W's"" and the slinky ""The Simple Mind"" both feature his frequent collaborator Dani     Siciliano in her usual torch song mode, which I can't get enough of.  I'm less enamored with Super_Collider's     Jamie Lidell, though, with his heavily mannered, faux-Al Jarreau yelps.  Both ""Everything's Changed"" and     ""The Many and the Few"" are less than they could be because of his presence.</p>
<p>A few dull moments aside, <i>Goodbye Swingtime</i> is a highly original and engaging record that's also one     of the last things one would expect for a producer who made his name with house music. It has a way of     confounding expectations even after multiple listens because of its unusual production approach. The way     Herbert combines the sound of a big band with his studied deconstruction, the invisible mental border we     draw between a record as document of a live event and a record as a product of studio technology is unusually     and unpredictably porous. Herbert always has a way of making confusion an attribute.</p></div>"|3833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3833-goodbye-swingtime/|7.6|Mark Richardson

    has borrowed, appropriated, subverted, and redispatched tiny bits and pieces of a million different (and
    varied) subcultures.  The sloppy-but-beautiful result of all this mashing is sorta impossible to define with
    any degree of authority or clarity (really, watch VH1 for five minutes and see) but rock's intangible,
    ass-kicking essence still rambles on in the eternally damned souls and pointed index/pinky fingers of
    contemporary outfits like NYC's blaring, 70s-inspired Darediablo. Even if you've been shamelessly
    devil-horning to <i>How the West Was Won</i> all summer, <i>Feeding Frenzy</i>, Darediablo's oozing
    Southern Records debut, is a thick enough slab of instrumental rock to earn some vigorous head-thrashing
    and volume-topping of its own.</p><p>
    Darediablo have distilled rock and roll to an alarmingly pure state (never fretting over peripheral shit
    like lyrics, vocalists, or a fourth member) and they deliver their throbbing, gimmick-free sprawl without
    a single weepy apology or power-ballad-for-the-ladies.  Hammond and Rhodes organs, guitars, and drums kick
    out the jams trio-style (keyboards at the front), and their muscular output sounds about as authentically
    rockist as possible in 2003-- although, like any group of honest rockers, Darediablo owe a few nods to their
    blues/jazz/funk brethren (especially groove-heavy outfits like The Meters).</p><p>
    And much like label-and-city mates Ui, Darediablo have nailed down blunt New York jabbing.  <i>Feeding
    Frenzy</i>'s thrusts are unrelenting: Jake Garcia's thick, angular riffing may evoke lots of fond (if
    repressed) Deep Purple memories, and all three have chops-y tendencies that could be considered sorta prog.
    But <i>Feeding Frenzy</i> is more of a beer-in-plastic-cups party than a studied meditation, and the music
    is jumpy enough to get anyone dancing-- even if all your moves are preemptively restricted to fist-pumping
    and head-bobbing.</p><p>
    ""The Hornet"" shows off the band's raw, throwback power: mercilessly self-assured, the track opens with some
    heavy, distorted guitar play, until organs pulse in and stake claim of the melody.  Chad Royce's drums push
    hard, Garcia solos nimbly, and keyboardist Matt Holford dutifully keeps shit in check; everywhere, kids in
    black t-shirts and ill-fitting jeans bite their lips and grimace happily.  The big, crunchy guitar opening
    (and subsequent recession) happens a lot on <i>Feeding Frenzy</i>-- ""Dark Horse"" sees Garcia's pounds fall
    away to some comparably benign organ jamming, while ""Slide Rule"" comfortably intertwines guitar and keyboard.
    Darediablo can be a little trickier than they seem on paper, though: the instrumentation here is clever enough
    to satiate those who regularly storm through <i>Guitar</i> magazine, and their approach is varied enough
    (from heavy to relaxed to curiously harmonious) to keep casual listeners poised and curious.</p><p>
    They've got kind of a ridiculous name, a semi-hilarious album title, and a photograph of a silvery fish
    popsicle on the red-checked cover of their record, but Darediablo still nobly transcend every other
    meatheaded hard rock cliché by consistently pushing out thick, unadorned, intellectual rock and roll--
    complete with compelling grooves, unremitting force, and lots of opportunities for bookshelf-shaking
    blasts.</p></div>"|2521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2521-feeding-frenzy/|7.2|Amanda Petrusich

Some people have argued that punk rock, with its
    easily reproduced songs and grassroots support system, represents a modern equivalent of the genre; others
    insist that hip-hop, with its origins in the street parties of the South Bronx, is the rightful heir to the
    loaded term.  Even Soul Asylum and the Red Hot Chili Peppers have claimed to be folk acts at one point or
    another.</p><p>
    
    Yes, the seemingly egalitarian political connotations of the word ""folk"" are a pretty hot property these days.
    But the same certainly can't be said about the word's aesthetic connotations.  As progressive as music that
    proclaims itself to be ""folk"" gets, the music that the rest of us call folk has remained pretty much the
    same-- acoustic, unadorned, melodic, and often making use of antiquated words and phrasings.  Even these
    purely musical qualities seem ideologically charged, though-- folk music has been, and still is, often
    construed as anti-modern, which in no small part explains why the genre has rarely ever been permeated by
    electronic instruments.</p><p>
    
    Still, not everyone is afraid to take folk music in new directions.  Will Oldham added more elaborate
    instrumentation, his own unique songwriting sensibility, and the word ""fuck"" to the folk music paradigm--
    with classic results.  Appendix Out frontman Alasdair Roberts shares Oldham's sensibilities in that regard,
    not so much dressing up the hundred-year-old corpses of folk songs as channeling their spirits into something
    very much his own.  On this, his second solo album, Roberts allows himself more room to stray from the
    traditional folk songs he so obviously adores, making a record that's ultimately less constrained and more
    convincing.</p><p>
<i>Farewell Sorrow</i> opens with its remarkably strong title track, which sounds like one of the finest
    classic folk songs never written.  Haunting and beautiful, ""Farewell Sorrow"" is impossible to place in time,
    as Roberts manages to deliver archaically worded sentences without sounding like a budget Yoda impersonator.
    ""Join Our Lusty Chorus"" fares less well, borrowing bits of a traditional hunting song without really
    integrating them into the greater framework of the song.  Indeed, the most interesting thing about
    <i>Farewell Sorrow</i> is the fact that the entirely Roberts-penned songs often better convey an air of
    somber, musty beauty than those that are built upon traditional folk melodies.</p><p>
    
    As with Roberts' debut full-length, <i>The Crook of My Arm</i>, <i>Farewell Sorrow</i>'s greatest weakness
    lies in its dynamic and textural homogeneity.  Though an endlessly pleasant album, it's rarely transcendent.
    ""When a Man's in Love He Feels No Cold"" is a charming song, but as shallow as its title suggests.  The more
    expanded bass, drums, and organ arrangements Roberts utilizes here keeps the album from dragging too much,
    but also draws attention away from Roberts' voice, which can be remarkably powerful when placed right at the
    front of the mix.</p><p>
    
    Weaknesses aside, <i>Farewell Sorrow</i> succeeds both in conveying Roberts' love of traditional folk music
    and demonstrating his ability to tinker with and expand upon it.  Increasingly, Roberts seems to be coming
    into his own sound-- one reverent towards the past without gratuitously shunning the present.  In other words,
    he's found his voice, and all that remains now is for him to figure out what it is he wants to say.</p></div>"|6800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6800-farewell-sorrow/|7.5|Matt LeMay

If that seems like a cliché, it's probably due to an overabundance of PC sloganeering that-- while 
    perhaps well-intentioned in its goal of inclusiveness-- has turned a shred of wisdom into an excuse to ignore.  Which is to say, if our voices are instruments, it 
    might stand to reason we're all musicians and that any one person's definition of music is as valid as the next.  Of course, this is where subjectivism, inclusiveness 
    and improvisation get tangled up into an intimidating knot that no one person is able to unravel or pass on to their friend for a second opinion.  Every sound is 
    art, or maybe nothing is art and we're all tooting our own horns.  And for Cage's sake, please don't bring up the post-modern.</p><p>
    So let's just say for the moment that every sound we make is ""music."" Other than de-emphasizing the preciousness of artistic expression (by way of 
    supply and demand), it should also make each of us an expert on composition and improvisation, even if we can only comment on our own.  The intimate 
    relationship artists have with their material-- and its connection to the social, political and natural world-- would in turn become a mundane 
    experience, worthy of not much more consideration than our choice of socks in the morning, or the last word in this sentence.  Ultimately, ""anyone can 
    do it,"" and despite my suspicion that this has never actually been true, it's still a comforting thought.</p><p>
    Japan's Ami Yoshida exposes these conditions on her solo CD <i>Tiger Thrush</i>, and in the process perhaps raises more questions than anyone without a grant 
    and six months sabbatical could hope to tackle.  Yet, in a basic sense, she amazes: if we are all allowed in the same artistic space, how is it that her 
    music seems so unprecedented and consistently surprising?</p><p>
    Yoshida was born in 1976 and performs improvised music with only her voice.  She specializes in a self-described ""howling voice"" wherein her 
    vocalizations often take the form of barely audible shrieks-- sometimes similar to frequent collaborator Sachiko M's supersonic sine-wave tones.  
    Other times, Yoshida produces sounds that don't seem to have been originated from a person at all: distorted ""electronic"" feedback, erratic clicks, 
    metallic scrapes and grating scratches.  On <i>Tiger Thrush</i> she often uses loops to further obscure her ""instrument"" to the point that the end result 
    has something in common with the experimental ambience of Farben or Sutekh.  I'm hard-pressed to call her music ""vocal"" or ""improvised,"" as the generally 
    very short sound fragments could be linked to any number of scenes, but I have no reservation in recommending this fascinating listen.</p><p>
    Since all 99 tracks are untitled, and many are shorter than 30 seconds, it's a little pointless to recommend highlights: <i>Tiger Thrush</i> works best 
    when you have the time to invest some serious ""deep listening"" (headphones are even better).  Many of the selections seem like the result of fanatically 
    obsessessive editing, even though I know they're merely short excerpts of Yoshida recorded at her Tokyo home.  Track 82 is a loop of her witchy growl; 
    83 a straight take of what sounds like a baby drowning in her own saliva; the opening 23-second cut sounds like something gone very wrong with your CD 
    drive, as if it was suddenly unable to play the album and began melting the lens instead.  I could go through the whole thing like this, but I doubt it 
    would give you a good idea of the experience.</p><p>
    Technically speaking, Yoshida (along with fellow improviser Toshimaru Nakamura, who mastered the disc) shares much with the Japanese onkyo 
    performers, in her use of silence and natural sound.  Some of the tracks use the ambience of her home (and the various sounds outside her window) as 
    counterpoint to her own emissions.  Track 85 features a loop of her voice singing a straight tone, but is colored by what was probably accidental 
    feedback from her microphone; this leads directly to a track where her growl is transformed into a warning siren.  In both cases, minimal compositional 
    elements are used to magical effect and though short in duration, should delight anyone who thinks they've got a handle on the capabilities of the 
    human voice.  More than that, it is hypnotic music; casting as potent a spell as any ambient recording I can think of.</p><p>
    Even though it's difficult to classify this music as straight improvisation, some folks averse to that may very well have the same reaction.  <i>Tiger 
    Thrush</i> is hardly the room-clearing storm that some of her peers in Japan's improvised music scene have been known to release (see Otomo Yoshihide's 
    stereo-destroying <i>The Night Before the Death of the Sampling Virus</i> as both a prime suspect, and prelude to all of onkyo), but if you aren't prepared to 
    accept the ""pictorial dictionary"" of all the sounds Yoshida is able to produce, it could be a long, maddening trip.  As I see it, this music is not 
    only mesmerizing because of her voice and subtle electronic manipulations, but because it manages to appeal to me on the same level as any other 
    ""traditionally"" beautiful recording.  No matter from what angle you approach the record, I figure everyone could use another one of those.</p></div>"|8862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8862-tiger-thrush/|8.5|Dominique Leone

I had read the backstory from the liner notes: an
    Atlanta bike messenger with an acute sensitivity to air takes a roadtrip one fall, brings along some guitars and a borrowed laptop. \x93You have roots and wings,\x94 he says,
    \x93but now is the time for roots.\x94 Just another guy using Scott Herrex92s name to issue a private experiment on Eastern Developments, I thought. Twenty long minutes of
    abstract snooze-out. Accessible, but inscrutable. Unreviewable.</p><p>
    From the dry perch of reviewery, the non-verbal cuts a slim profile. Sometimes it just vanishes. This is no great loss for literature, but music is a different story: often the
    more wordy (like most rap) or wordish (like Prefuse 73) an album is, the easier it is to describe and evoke in words. Music writers regularly dodge this problem by talking about
    people, or scenes, instead of the music itself, but that's not a solution.</p><p>
    Oddly, <i>This Book is About Words</i> is the least verbal music I've heard in a long time. Only after a month-long train trip through India, a week-long silence at my computer,
    and a day-long blackout did I start to wander away from the thought of talking about this music. I saw something there, and I want to tell you about it. </p><p>
    Each track unfolds in a meandering line, like a bike messenger who's forgotten his destination but not the urgency of the message; or, as the liner notes suggest, an
    \x93unmanned vehicle.\x94 The feel of acoustic guitar sets up a lot of the figures, kind of like Villa Lobos meets Nick Drake as seen through a variety of prisms and filters.
    The textures that result are alternately fuzzy and airy, open and clean-- undemanding, and sincere. Music that's almost richer when you forget to listen.</p><p>
    \x93Para Eva\x94 abandons a driving tick-track early on for some aimless noodling, but the harmonic logic starts to drop back in, slowly, as the track becomes its own autopilot,
    pushing into a simple vamp that hides a little system of twangs and skips. The basis of a real beat-- fashioned from sampled taps and cracks-- even drops for a few
    seconds in \x93Tobacco Path\x94 before the guitar licks pan out in a ticcish fit of self-interruption. </p><p>
    \x93Goodbye Beautifuls\x94 stutter-sprays its opening sallies, then voids itself in diphthongs and cracklings, but \x93Cadaques\x94 proves a real song, with the kind of aimless inertia that
    few but Evan Mast have mastered. The only track whose unplugged version might stand on its own is \x9385 Into Night\x94; muffled plucks and greasy squeaks confirm that this
    music is digital after all: music for fingers.  Perusing its own flat domain, barrelling down a road leading to more road, <i>This Book is About Words</i>
    is scattering in a fit of skips and purrs. And panning out.</p></div>"|7697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7697-this-book-is-about-words/|7.5|Jascha Hoffman

    genre seems almost terminally idle.  But sweet-faced, shaggy-haired poet-players have always seeped up an
    inordinate amount of hyperbolic, next-big-thing gushing from critics and fans; it's usually the kind of
    unchecked flattery that stems from recognizing what massive balls it takes to be unabashedly earnest,
    accepting that it's actually kinda brave to indulge the precious sentimentality that goes hand-in-hand
    with maudlin emoting.</p><p>
    Come the fuck on.  This shit doesn't earn anyone a free pass.  It's still possible to-- without repressing
    romanticism entirely-- take your broken heart and make its artistic likeness more interesting and dynamic
    than the overwrought, acoustic sap perpetuated every day in coffeehouses and Hallmark stores across America.
    Because on its own, even a really convincing Sincere Face is never enough to make anyone's gut flip.</p><p>
    Yes, the soft, tortured acoustic ballad is a valid and occasionally transcendental form of creative
    expression (see Dylan, Buckley, Nick Drake et. al.) but over the last fifty years, it's also become
    mind-numbingly formulaic.  Irish troubadour Damien Rice's steadfast refusal to revise and redeploy means
    that his ten-track debut, for all its quiet confessions, is ultimately far more stagnant and sonically
    predictable than anybody wants to admit: <i>O</i>'s musical path is so painfully well-tread that the record
    seems at times almost self-mocking, and Rice himself singer/songwrites like he's playing that shit on TV.
    Bravely calling on all renowned acoustic slingers from Joan Baez to Elliott Smith, Rice synthesizes the
    defining characteristics of folk-rock's quirky forefathers without coughing up a single noteworthy
    contribution of his own-- not only is Rice failing to augment the contemporary folk-rock paradigm, he's
    just doing an awkward imitation. </p><p>
    The big, inescapable problem with <i>O</i> is that, aside from being derivative, Rice's songwriting is also
    unbearably repetitive-- he stubbornly relies upon time-tested singer/songwriter formulas (quiet acoustic
    strumming and sober, wavering vocals), and repeats them almost exactly the same way, every time.  Even his
    noble attempts at creating distinction, including an expectedly swelling string section whose rises and
    falls are, yes, cartoonishly familiar, seem knee-jerk and contrived.  The whisper/scream trick, the dim
    acoustic intro, the painfully restrained percussion, the lilting chorus-- a hidden, a cappella version of
    ""Silent Night""?  Really?</p><p>
    And yet Rice makes it difficult to pull the bullshit card, because <i>O</i> is so unrelentingly affable.
    It's thoughtfully rendered, and if only superficially, all the proper parts are in place.  His breathy
    vocals-- curiously pitched and slightly broguish-- are compelling, and when mixed with the airy coos of
    the impeccable Lisa Hannigan, these songs <i>can</i> surpass their mundane, by-the-book casings, at least
    momentarily; likewise, Rice is a capable guitar player, although his Dave Matthews-via-David Gray
    pluck-and-strum can be awfully exhausting.  Still, irksome familiarity will always eclipse niceness,
    and this record's got no surprises.</p><p>
    Single ""Volcano"" is <i>O</i>'s highlight.  A rich, meandering cello line slides in between jerky acoustic
    strums, light drums and curt cymbal tapping pushing up against Rice's sufficiently vague lyrics (""What I am
    to you/ Is not real/ What I am to you/ Is not what you mean to me"").  There's a spectral creepiness implied
    in the uncomfortable sparseness of the track, which sorta falls apart in the crooned bridge, but comes back
    in the haunting, many-tracked vocal breakdown with Hannigan, and its sinister suggestion is welcome-- when
    ""The Blower's Daughter"" interrupts, with its dramatic ""I can't take my eyes off of you!"" hollers, the memory
    of ""Volcano""'s baleful, Nastasia-y threat becomes infinitely more appealing.  Things get worse: even the
    leather bound adult-alternative handbook advises against publicly airing sentiments like ""Cannonball""'s
    ""Love/ Taught me to cry.""</p><p>
<i>O</i> has a thick canvas cover and impressive art-book packaging; its liner notes are crammed with drawings,
    paintings, and curiously superimposed poems.  It seems instantly unfair that the record housed inside doesn't
    get the same kind of boundary-breaking treatment, but relies instead on all the whiny, sad-eyed clichés of a
    genre in desperate need of a fresh approach.</p></div>"|6898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6898-o/|5.4|Amanda Petrusich

Slide guitars, on the other hand, sound great.
    Earthbound as they usually are, country and blues lend themselves remarkably well to the atmosphere, set
    amongst the reverb and stars; witness Pink Floyd's ""A Pillow of Winds"" or Beechwood Sparks' ""Sweet Julie
    Ann"".  These are just two of the bands that quickly spring to mind when Lowlights' self-titled debut drifts
    out of the speakers like a transmission from a drifting satellite.  Another name-- one that flashes even
    brighter-- is Spiritualized, those masters of interstellar heartache who've lately given over to indigestible
    orchestral bloat, leaving behind a perfect vacancy for California's Lowlights to fill with their synthesis of
    Gram Parsons folk and regal, ionospheric psych.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with a sweep of pure phase space-rock called ""In the Distance"", a slow descent overflowing
    with huge harmonies jerked earthward by dense clusters of distorted guitar.  ""Wave Goodbye"" puts the brushes
    to the drumkit and the steel to the strings, but never comes down completely, floating a few miles up as
    bandleader Dameon Lee admonishes, ""Don't turn around/ Just wave goodbye.""  Generally, Lee sticks to narrating
    human emotion in his songs-- there's none of the drug damage of Spiritualized or bedsit philosophy of The
    Verve to distract from the heartache and desperation in his songs.</p><p>
    
    Lowlights definitely have a sound/bandname synergy going on-- the gentle repetition of ""Brown Eyes"", with
    its lonely, echoing trumpet and weeping pedal steel is a great way to come down from a physically active day
    of mowing the lawn and assembling Swedish furniture.  The band squeezes a lot of variation from a fairly
    limited sound palette, constantly shifting tempos and making little changes, like subtly subbing in a
    harpsichord for an acoustic guitar, while keeping the overarching sound full of cavernous echo and open
    space.  Lee's voice has gravel enough to sound weighty even when cast in the album's zero-gravity atmosphere,
    and he's well complemented by the silk-smooth backing harmonies of Angela Brown.</p><p>
    
    On the whisper-quiet ""Wheelbarrow"", which features guest vocalist Brisa Roche backed only by a wandering
    Rhodes and a quivering Farfisa, Lowlights conjure some of Yo La Tengo's sparsest Georgia Hubley ballads,
    yet things close at a majestic crawl with ""How Does It Feel?"", a languid drift through the solar system
    topped by pining steel and lush, homespun folk harmonies.  Thick electric guitar cuts in on the refrain,
    a false start that teases at a closing firestorm, but shuts down instead, bowing to the pastoral glow of
    the verses.</p><p>
    
    It's an impressive debut, and Lowlights seem to have all the pieces in place to churn out at least a few
    more in the near future.  They have a mastery of the texture that a record like this requires to pass as
    more than just an ambling experiment, and they've proven they have the ability to write more than one kind
    of song, which is something a lot of their peers simply can't do.  They may not be doing anything terribly
    new, but their execution is beautiful, and sometimes that's more than enough.</p></div>"|4946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4946-lowlights/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    reputable rock publications, praising <i>Cyborgs Revisited</i> as nothing less than ""the greatest Canadian
    rock album ever.""  And sure, they overreacted, but you understand, because this is everything a cult album
    should be: the only trace of a lost band that was so exciting, but so obscure it's a wonder there's anything
    to remember them by at all.</p><p>
    
    This album first came out in 1989, a full decade after Simply Saucer had broken up.  Flipping through the
    small booklet, you can read countless anecdotes of rock band purgatory: gigs that almost sparked riots,
    others that did nothing at all, rough demos, stolen gear, and of course, continuous line-up changes.  In
    spite of it all, the band kept experimenting-- like the time they cranked up the feedback in their Hamilton,
    Ontario rehearsal space, and went outside to see if they could hear it (they could), locking themselves out
    in the process.  The local firemen who had to let the band back inside described it as ""the loudest sound
    heard in these parts since World War II.""</p><p>
    
    Here's a band that could splice the DNA of Syd Barrett and Soft
    Machine with Iggy Pop and the Velvet Underground, that could bridge post-psychedelic mind-altering
    electronics with a buzzed proto-punk urgency: the ultimate garage band, rehearsing constantly and trying
    everything and doing it all at top fucking volume.  And right after they finally got around to issuing
    their debut release, a well-received seven-inch, in 1978, the band split and became history.</p><p>
    
    The saga, however, was just getting underway.  Longtime Saucer fan Bruce ""Mole"" Mowat uncovered enough of
    the band's material in the late 1980s to assemble an actual posthumous full-length album.  A one-single
    cult band that could have been consigned to <i>Nuggets III: Original Artyfacts from the Northern Territories
    and Beyond</i> instead captured their own spotlight.  Mowat culled nine songs from a forgotten studio
    session and a free afternoon show at a shopping center, and crazily, they're all so fantastic that you
    can properly call them a legacy.</p><p>
    
    The studio cuts come from a 1974 session recorded by Bob Lanois in his and brother Daniel's basement studio
    (the live set was recorded a year later).  We'll never know what the band's original epic setpieces sounded
    like, but apparently, by this point, frontman and main songwriter Edgar Breau was cutting the material down
    into more concise songs (if jarring and very eccentric ones)-- it's all the fury of the band's live sprawl
    crammed into the most condensed possible space.  These sessions are explosive, with Breau playing the
    space-rock guitar hero while Ping Romany works out on Moog synth and some other analog electronics.  The
    three live tracks, meanwhile, see the band stretching out: drums and bass gallop through on ""Illegal Bodies"",
    setting up a noisy busy-circuit solo from Romany that sets the stage for Breau's most precise, shrieking
    guitar attack.  Even at a free show on a Saturday afternoon you can tell these guys were an absolutely
    crushing entity in the flesh.</p><p>
    
    But jams and noise-rock don't always ossify well onto vinyl.  Which brings us back to the songs: a whole set
    of garage rock classics that are both ecstatic and bluntly riff-bound.  Breau wrote lyrics that were strikingly
    direct-- from ""Instant Pleasure""'s demand for carnal reward, to ""Nazi Apocalypse""'s crass punk humor, to
    ""Bullet Proof Nothing"", which just keeps demanding, ""Treat me like dirt.""  And though Breau's voice, while
    strong and clear, has no actual remarkable qualities (I'm saying he'd never stand out in a garage-rocker
    line-up), it's the perfect counterbalance to the music, grounding Simply Saucer's instrumental flights and
    Romany's ""third ear"" electronics.</p><p>
    
    Sonic Unyon's reissue collects the 1989 album, and also tacks on a half hour of rehearsal and live tapes.
    The later material (dating from '77 and '78) has the band arcing away from psychedelia and closer to
    proto-punk; Ping Romany has quit and Steve Parks has joined the band on second guitar.  The bonus tracks
    sound rough but they include some gems, like the bluesy ""Low Profile"" demo or the album's only ballad, the
    affecting ""Yes I Do"".  Sonic Unyon also included the first CD issue of the band's single, ""I Can Change My
    Mind"", along with its flipside, ""She's a Dog"".  The single deservedly made waves in its day, landing them a
    touring slot with Pere Ubu, but the band sounds diminished on it: the songs are jagged, semi-chaotic shards
    of sneer-punk with lyrics that snarl but that never hinge off the groin like the band's earlier work.</p><p>
    
    It shouldn't have ended there-- the band were slated to record an official full-length before they disbanded--
    though it is hard to imagine how this band could have improved on <i>Cyborgs Revisited</i>; ""I Can Change My
    Mind"" and ""She's a Dog"", in particular, seem like formal grade school portraits after all the candid craziness
    that came before them.  With all their ideas and influences it's unbelievable that we could catch them at a
    point of such balance, but that might have been because they didn't freeze up to perfect it.  Simply Saucer
    made their defining statement without even knowing it.  How can you beat that?</p></div>"|7704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7704-cyborgs-revisited/|8.8|Chris Dahlen

Playing-up the reclusive-genius schtick to such an extent that some of these cats look like Unabombers-in-training, 
    its major artists have catered to one primary fanbase-- reclusive shut-ins and undersexed college kids-- by maximizing the I and M whilst largely ignoring the D (all respect to Ludacris, yo).  The 
    brooding dourness of the scene hasn't just disregarded dancing, though, as many of the major players in the game focus on abstraction to the extent that visceral reaction of any sort is out of 
    the question.  In shot, this record did <em>not make me dance.</em></p><p>
    
    His music might not encourage conventional dancing, but Donna Summer (obviously not the diva) doesn't suffer idle head-bobbing lightly.  A balding, slightly overweight journalist and 
    WFMU DJ named Jason Forrest, Summer works in a manner encompassing every IDM-trend to come along in the past decade-- drill-n-bass, gabba, tigerbeat6-esque laptop trickery, 
    plunderphonics-- all are fair game for Summer to destroy and recontextualize.  Part of a loose collective of sample-fiends, including Giorgio Marauder (AKA END) and Duran Duran Duran,
    all working under the nom de 
    electronique ""cock-rock disco,"" Summer and crew are proponents of what Forrest refers to in a recent Vice Magazine piece as ""the new computer music.""  Musically speaking, these acts have little to do 
    with traditional 
    disco, and while computers surely factor in heavily, things never get too tech-geeky.  Performance-wise, however, the banner starts to make sense-- playing out all over Europe to sold-out 
    audiences, they (and Summer in particular) have become renowned as much for their flamboyant, confrontational shows as for their challengingly appealing music.</p><p>
    
    Listening to <i>This Needs to Be Your Style</i>, Summer's second release (following the <i>To All Methods Which Calculate Power</i> EP), is disorienting at first: imagine your 
    favorite DJ scratching and 
    crossfading between your local best-of-the-80s radio station and a Hrvastki record, and you're getting close.  Summer assembles tracks almost solely from samples, albeit with a heavy DSP 
    coating.  Like John Oswald's Plunderphonics approach (Summer is an admitted Oswald fiend), his tracks blatantly taunt copyright laws, though his sample choices surprisingly avoid the esoteric 
    in favor of more obvious pop-based sources.</p><p>
    
    As a result, and despite the avant-garde construction, a pop feel permeates many of the tracks-- ""What You Truly Need"" is loaded with fragmented call-and-response vocal cuts, horn stabs, and 
    radio-funk palm-muted guitar chugging, while ""We Call It 'The Box'"" flays hip-hop conventions, coasting on 808 hits and what sounds like a sample from Planet Patrol's rollerskating-rink classic 
    ""Play At your Own Risk"".  Things get even more pop on ""Heels Over Head"", during which Summer inverts the classic Go-Go's single.  Intercut by a sample of the organ-buildup from J. Geils' ""Freeze 
    Frame"", Summer rips ""Head Over Heels"" apart at the seams, leaving the signature melodic hook intact as a basis over which to splatter drill-n-bass heroics.</p><p>
    
    The ""rock"" part of the ""cock-rock disco"" equation does shine through on two of the album's most technically impressive cuts.  The album's structural masterwork, ""Prog's Not Dead"" lives up to its 
    title, as 13/8 time signatures fly by at a disarming pace.  Unfortunately, the track also succumbs to the traps of the genre at which it slyly winks-- this is surely digital-virtuosity of the highest-order, 
    but like even the best prog-rock, the musical-masturbation tires quickly.  Summer fares better on ""Accept the Cheap"", where elaborate polyrythms and video games plinks clash with metal guitar 
    riffing, truly fulfilling the promise of his vision of this ""cock-rock disco.""</p><p>
    
    Full of enough copyright-abusing fellatio to choke Kid 606's pussycat, <i>This Needs to Be Your Style</i> shreds through familiar hooks with such blinding pace that their origin can only be 
    discerned after 
    repeated listens. Like Max Tundra's <i>Mastered By Guy At the Exchange</i>, this is a pop record at heart, loaded with familiar blips of melody and rhythm, but filtered through the perspective of something 
    truly rare: a hyperactive IDM'er who really just wants to RAWK.</p></div>"|2516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2516-this-needs-to-be-your-style/|8.1|Brad Hurst

    Tackling myriad frozen forms-- a cold, steel van or dark room, cold hearts and complicated breakups-- with the smokey vocals of a Midwestern Jawbreaker, 
    the anomalous four-piece is too heavy and unsentimental to fit the current emo framework, too Cometbus romantic for the majority of today's floor punchers, 
    and way too pop punk for the indie set.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of categorization, <i>The River Bed</i> is a wise warming-up to the band's early, most cathartic form. Less self-consciously clean than 
    <i>Our Own Wars</i> (1999) and rawer than the often hollow <i>Dead Reckoning</i> (2001), a number of  <i>The River Bed</i>'s 
    tracks are a satisfying blend the band's nascent sound: catchy bass playing, three-part harmonies (one melodic singer, one distant screamer, 
    one burly shouter), and tender teen lyrics package in a blue-collar aesthetic.  Despite what the record snobs tell you, emotion doesn't have to turn into a 
    caricature, and punk with hooks isn't necessarily embarrassing. I'm not generally a fan of this sort of music, but Small Brown Bike have a certain je ne 
    sais quoi that keeps me returning to their rust-belt sermon.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with ""Deconstruct/Rebuilt"", a claustrophobic scribble on citywide alienation; like the best Small Brown Bike, its tone remains 
    triumphant despite the dour positioning of lyrics like, ""So I stare outside the window and I wish I was alive,"" which could only be a late-summer battle cry for 
    unshaven urban hermits.  ""Safe in Sound"" and ""A Declaration of Sorts"" are both midtempo lovesongs that build to a final shout-a-long, the kind of 
    thing Jawbreaker did well for so long, but emo (and Jets To Brazil) in the 90s just hasn't. In ""Safe in Sound"" Mike Reed shouts staccato,  ""I can 
    see it/ A picture of one cold, dark cloud/ A mist around you to choke the painful words out of your crooked mouth."" It's no ""Chesterfield King"", but  
    it's effective in its own way, especially the final group shout of "" I will be there to resuscitate you.""</p><p>
    
    ""What's Missing Is Dead"" is an epic, sprawling chanter about emptiness full of odd percussive shaker rattles and thinly sliced feedback: ""I 
    brought home a fake badge to wear around the house and show my loved ones how much I try/ I've killed what's missing."" Perhaps because the band 
    includes brothers Ben and Mike Reed, family and a sense of place are regular thematic watering holes. Outside of the brief romantic tableaus, this is the 
    band's strongest lyric path.</p><p>
    
    Through eight songs, <i>The River Bed</i> doesn't miss too many beats; unfortunately, the track list goes to ten, and its final two compositions cave-in on their 
    own ambitions. ""The Outline of Your Hand Still Remains On My Hands"" is-- in title at least-- the sappiest Small Brown Bike to 
    date. A twangy, tumbleweed-etched ballad, it describes the unraveling of a relationship in a darkly ponderous <i>Spiderland</i> tone. It's not horrible, but 
    its frozen molasses pace is meandering at best.  Things only get less dynamic on a ""A Lesson To Remember"" the plodder that follows in its wake. 
    The album's longest track, ""A Lesson To Remember"" formally links to <i>Dead Reckoning</i>'s equally lengthy and dramatic closer, ""I Will Bury You in Me"" (that 
    album's strongest track, and a manic finis). In lieu of kick-ass, roof-top fireworks, ""A Lesson To Remember"" can only pass-off ghostly slide guitar, sharp 
    arpeggios, and cheesy group harmonizing.</p><p>
    
    Thanks to their shaky ponderousness, Small Brown Bike have never topped the lo-fi caterwauling of 1999's <i>Collection</i>, a thirteen-song 
    compilation of 7-inch singles, compilation tracks, and the band's demo tape. Owing to inexpensive recording techniques, the band fell into Guided By 
    Voices' poppy collage aesthetics, applying a cut and splice overload to hardcore dynamics: ""Crossing Guard"" and ""Cold"", for 
    example, were stitched with feedback and a slow motion, insanely sludgy drum beat, plus guitarist Travis Dropp's super dense background bellow. While the 
    band projected this tough-ass sound, a gentle homesick heartbeat thumped in the center. Often so-called progression brings with it a tendency to add 
    strings, electronic bleeps, or the aim for an anomalous genre bending mishmash of outsider influences. With bands like Small Brown Bike who excel 
    at contrasts, pummeling their instruments and finding a path towards melody through splintering volume  and sludgy hiss, such arty detours ineluctably 
    sabotage their strengths.</p></div>"|7703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7703-the-river-bed/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

Grim title. Not a single new song. What we have on our hands is a perfect posthumous release,
    with the sole disadvantage that Paul Banks &amp; Co. are still walking this Earth.  Owing less to inspiration
    than to a multi-pronged strategy for breaking the band in every possible market, Interpol's <i>Black EP
    arrives to European stores and Stateside hard drives today loaded with some dubious booty. I've kept my
    backlash impulse in check all through the band's ascent, but that urge (to horribly paraphrase) is out of
    the icebox.</i></p><p>
    
    Opening the disc is ""Say Hello to the Angels"", arguably one of the weakest numbers on the band's 2002
    debut, <i>Turn on the Bright Lights; it's the only one that sounds something like The Strokes, and
    thus makes for the record's most predictable single. Since the version included here is the same one found
    on the LP, it makes little sense to discuss it in the context of this EP, although I can't help but note
    that it does feature the all-time widest gamut of Banks's lyrical skills: going from the genuinely great
    line, ""This isn't you yet/ What you thought was such a conquest,"" to the lazy, automatic scripture, ""You're
    hair is so pretty and red/ Baby, baby you're really the best,"" is one of the most painful juxtapositions in
    quality in the band's entire catalog (though ""Obstacle 1""'s ""Her stories are boring and stuff/ She's always
    calling my bluff"" still marks the nadir).</i></p><p>
    
    Next comes the demo version of ""NYC"" already available on the <i>Yes New York</i> compilation.  Lacking the
    album's caviar-rich production and Greg Calbi's always impeccable mastering, the song loses most of its
    whooshing sweep; in fact, it begins to sound suspiciously like something by Luna circa <i>Penthouse</i>.
    One could argue that isn't a problem, since Interpol will in all likelihood tone down their insecure,
    overeager fashion sense and tidily fall into that chic, detached role at some point, but the rest of the
    EP is pure ballast.</p><p>
    
    The remaining four cuts are culled from the band's August 27, 2002 appearance on The Black Sessions, a
    popular in-studio concert broadcast on France's Inter radio, aired during Bernard Lenoir's <i>C'est
    Lenoir</i> program.  By now a widely available bootleg (with several additional tracks not included on
    this EP), their <i>Maison de la Radio</i> Black Session evidences a frequent complaint leveled against
    these <i>Royal Tenenbaum</i> goths: the sound of their songs in a live setting varies little from how
    they appear on record.  To boot, this was clearly not the band's most ""on"" performance: the <i>Turn on the
    Bright Lights</i> tracks (""PDA"", ""Leif Erikson"" and ""Obstacle 1"") are sober and flat, and impossibly,
    ""Specialist""-- an excellent track they've strategically made something of a ""rarity""-- sounds even more
    exhausted than its dub-like indie jangle.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to imagine a reason a label would issue this disc, other than to pacify completists, but the
    rabid fans will no doubt already have the entire Black Session on MP3.  You can throw a bone in a variety of
    ways, but <i>Black chooses the most insulting one, bouncing widely traded material off our begging noses.
    The best EPs out there feel like genuine spasms of generosity, even if they're overt placeholders while a
    band cautiously probes new turf or clears house before a big departure; Radiohead's </i><i>Airbag/How Am I
    Driving?, the </i><i>ne plus ultra</i> of the latter, packed seven songs, ten pages of artwork and Noam
    Chomsky's biggest paycheck.</p><p>
    
    Whether or not Interpol have had much of hand in the decision-making behind <i>Turn on the Bright Lights'
    satellite releases, it is having an affect on their image.  That their debut album was priced under $8 until
    it began to take off was a windfall in cool and credibility, but as their singles discography continues to
    grow and the level of substance decreases, fans might not be remiss in wondering if the band had planned all
    along to recoup by selling the same album twice.</i></p></div>"|4115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4115-the-black-ep/|3.5|Michael Idov

He started out creating personas on <i>Language Arts</i>, moved onto developing a distinct style (<i>Vertex</i>) and was last heard experimenting with 
    drum 'n' bass rhythms-- and weird song structures-- on <i>Man Overboard</i>.  Now the self-proclaimed ""Ratfish"" has shifted to a major label, and into a new, slightly contradictory focus: accessibility
    through the esoteric.</p><p>
    
    Buck (government name Rich Terfry) is best known for three elements: his terrible voice (best described as chain-smoking 10 year old), his rigid flow and, most importantly, his diverse subject 
    matter. Although nothing on this album is on the level of obscurity as his sub-famous ""Centaur"" narrative, Stinkin' Rich still manages to rip through a myriad of issues. He goes from discussing 
    intergender politics (""Square 2"") to the tribulations of childhood friendship (later on the same cut), to the social ramifications of science (""Square 4""). He even has a narrative about a local girl's 
    degeneration at the hands of incest rumors regarding her family (""Square 3"").</p><p>
    
    The trouble doesn't come with his rhymes either, as Bucky comes relatively fresh throughout the album. When confronting his past, he claims that he'd ""go down by the river to watch the way 
    the devil dances/ I never took his hand, even though I did have several chances."" When describing his gripes with industry asskissers, he explains that they ""can't dance but do dance anyway"" 
    and have ""vampire fangs and see-through hearts."" Lyrically, he tones down the bravado and persona switching, settling instead on distant narratives and detached commentary, slowly showing 
    contempt for traditional hip-hop barriers. Although he lacks vocal dexterity, and may bug out every now and then-- threatening to ""ovulate on your pillowcase""-- Buck 65 still stands tall as one of 
    the best writers in underground rap. </p><p>
    
    His production borrows heavily from early 90s masters like Prince Paul (De La Soul), Digable Planets and Ali Shaheed Muhammad (A Tribe Called Quest) and it definitely shows on 
    <i>Square</i>. From down-tempo tone experiments on ""Square 3"" to the labored piano loops of ""Square 2"" and some elegantly flipped video game sampling, Buck knows that being 
    saddled with such a rough voice, he lives and dies on his production.</p><p>
    
    Separated into four tracks that range from 13 to 17 minutes apiece, <i>Square</i> is a concept album clearly developed with the ideas of consistent play and analysis in mind, but, in actuality, 
    Buck's intentions make the album disjointed: it's a chore to fast forward past a four-minute instrumental breakdown to get to some rapping. In fact, over the 60 minutes of <i>Square</i>, 
    there are only about 13 rap songs, typically three minutes each. This leaves roughly a third of the album to less-than-progressive instrumentals, hit and miss vocal samples and above-average 
    scratching. These techniques are welcome on the album, but come with the added expense of a bloated listening experience. </p><p>
    
    ""Square 4"" is where Rich cuts corners and develops the deadly circle that envelops all the worst elements of the album: a lack of focus, concepts meant to show versatility that end up flawed in 
    execution and overlong), and pointless instrumental breakdowns that wreck the consistency of the movement. A particularly embarrassing moment comes near the middle, where Buck makes 
    it abundantly clear that he is ridiculously hungry. Not as an emcee per se, but as a person. Imagine playing this at a social gathering and seeing faces contort at every ""Mmmmm..."" that Buck 65 
    tosses to the listener.</p><p>
    
    Still, keep in mind that everything that led up to this final Cube-sized serving was a melodic mix of folk rock sensibility, smooth early 90s style production, clever lyrical observations and a relatively 
    enjoyable train ride into the mental station of Halifax's best-known emcee. Although unable to touch his 1999 masterpiece <i>Vertex</i>, Buck shows his plans for progress in his home-brewed rap 
    subgenre.</p></div>"|1068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1068-square/|7.0|Rollie Pemberton

They're too sharp to 
    fail. After all, Minibar-- guitarist/singer Simon Petty, bassist Sid Jordan, guitarist Tim Walker and drummer Malcolm Cross-- are quite content doing their own thing, 
    whether anyone takes notice or not, especially since their debut (2001's <em>Road Movies</em>) received no backing from then-label Universal. As Petty recounted in the July/August issue of <em>No 
    Depression</em>, life after Universal ""forced [Minibar] to become a much tighter unit not just musically, but as a band in the broadest sense of the word.""</p><p> 
    
    Petty is true to his word, though his band is hardly the type to start any us-against-them fistfights. Like their fellow countryman Peter Bruntnell, Minibar have a knack for cranking out beautiful, simple, 
    dusty alt-country descriptions of their adopted homeland (the Southwestern United States). But they're more Jay Farrar-- he with the voice like a January desert sky-- than say, Calexico.  It's worth making a 
    comparison to the slightly-better-known Bruntnell, himself a Farrar disciple and employer of former Son Volters Dave Boquist and Eric Heywood, to boot. Where Bruntnell offsets his quiet 
    moments with willful weirdness (<em>Normal for Bridgewater</em>'s ""By the Time My Head Gets to Phoenix"" or ""Tabloid Reporter"" from <em>Ends of the Earth</em>), Minibar stick to the plaintive 
    steel pedal lament.</p><p>
    
    Album opener ""It Is What It Is"" sets the desert-vibe template that runs through all of <em>Fly Below the Radar</em>. With an air of Zen peace (""It is what it is/ There's no need 
    for argument at all"") and the autumnal chill of the guitar and keyboards, the song's pounding bridge comes as a surprise. Minibar may not wander too far from the trail, but they can find a hook 
    in even the simplest song. Which is a good thing, otherwise <em>Fly Below the Radar</em> would trigger a rash of suicides. ""Unstoppable"" finds Petty noting that ""I've been alone for so long/ 
    Sometimes I don't know what to say."" An album full of lyrics like that and you'll find yourself hoping for some Bruntnellian kookiness. Fortunately, the middle of the album is brightened by the 
    funky ""Somebody Down Here Loves You""; delivered with a knowing wink by Petty (the son of a vicar, as is Jordan), this tune of earthly delights is the alt-country equivalent to Matthew Sweet's 
    ""Evangeline"". </p><p>
    
    But then it's back to the lonesome trail, and by now <em>Fly Below the Radar</em> is either thematically cohesive or thematically oppressive. I'm opting for the former, as there's an unmistakable 
    quiet charm informing even the lesser songs. ""Martha"" approximates a dustier Willard Grant Conspiracy, loosed from their chamber (WGC themselves a band that exudes quiet charm). The tune 
    is inspired by <em>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em>; in the words of fellow alt-countryman Jeff Tweedy: ""He takes all his words from the books that you don't read anyway.""  It was a play Jeff, 
    but we won't nitpick.</p><p>
    
    The title track boasts the album's fist-pumpingest chorus, and proves these guys can rock out when they need to, but they also excel at tunes like the acoustic ""Badlands"", which is haunted by 
    ghostly violins and images of the Joshua ""field of crucifixion trees."" Taken as a whole, Minibar is not tears-in-your-beer music; it's more 
    pull-over-on-a-deserted-stretch-of-Texas-highway-sit-on-the-hood-of-your-car-and-count-the-stars-on-a-cool-clear-evening music. Surely there's a pithier description of their niche, but why 
    settle for one word when 25 will do nicely.</p><p> 
    
    Minibar are content to let the experience and idea of the Southwestern U.S. wash over them, not actively seek out the heart of the region...which is also the best way to ""get"" <em>Fly Below the Radar</em>.
    ""Fragile""-- every bit the road song with its spacey keyboards-- recalls the Zen air of ""It Is What It Is"": ""There nothing we can do anyway/ So just smile and tell yourself it'll be okay,' and coming out of 
    Petty's mouth, it's not so much sad as it is true (and it might just double as the band's mantra given their dealings with major labels). </p><p>
    
    While it's asking a lot to rely on four transplanted Brits to approach alt-country's mid-90s heyday, <em>Fly Below the Radar</em> is the kind of record many alt-country fans have been waiting for since 
    Son Volt's <em>Trace</em>; lord knows Farrar, last seen flying past Saturn with the ""Space Junk"" of <em>Terroir Blues</em> is not the man for the job. </p></div>"|5540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5540-fly-below-the-radar/|6.1|Stephen Haag

    summarize certain of its 28 dumbfounding cuts, almost all of which are characterized by awkward phrasing
    and excellent musicianship:</p><p>
<li> <b>""Rat a Tat Tat, America"":</b> A bicentennial march about the dignity of birds that somehow
    builds to a machine-gun salute to our freest of lands that sold guns to Indonesian rapists, etc.  Imagine
    an ""I Like Ike""-era Disney response to <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>.<p>
<li> <b>""I Like Yellow Things"":</b>  Plagiarizes at least three standards to constitute an easy-boogie,
    canary-themed list, a la <i>The Sound of Music</i>.  A ""Pomp and Circumstance"" for the short bus set.<p>
<li> <b>""I'm Just the Other Woman"":</b> Sung by a trilling male, from a lovestung Lazarus' point of view.
    John Waters needs this bad.<p>
<li> <b>""Human Breakdown of Absurdity"":</b> David Koresh gets a thesaurus.  Something wonderful about
    Israel and the occult and the government and the undead and massacres and whores.<p>
<li> <b>""Richard Nixon"":</b> Stunning slice of civil religion, circa 'Nambat.  I promise it ain't just a
    novelty; you'll recue the chorus, ""God in his infinite wisdom put Richard Nixon on this Earth/ To bring
    to us his heritage, one of priceless worth.""  This ode to a ""blessed man, surely in God's plan"" will warm
    your heart as you give thanks for how Condolences Rice has hit up TVangelist Jack Van Impe for an ""outline""
    of Revelation/Armageddon.  Nixon is a ""genius,"" a ""miracle,"" ""the rapture of music and melody/ of culture
    and of love.""  And curse those damned Jews!<p>
<li> <b>""Jimmy Carter Says Yes"":</b> Isaac Hayes does <i>The Nation</i>.  Superfly does Plains, Georgia.
    The referendum gets skull-pimped.<p>
<li> <b> ""How Long Are You Staying"":</b> Every line rhymes ""disco"" (Frisco, Crisco), but I can't tell if
    it's about unemployment or blueballs.<p>
<li> <b> ""I Lost My Girl to an Argentinean Cowboy"":</b>  Either the most suave slice of mannuendo ever, or
    the funniest slice of unintentional homoeroticism ever.  Thrill to the saga of a ""cooing"" ""gayboy""
    ""hip-shooting"" ""cavalier"" ""whip-cracking"" ""great-romancing"" ""tenor.""  Watch out for the ""bunkhouse gang.""<p>
<li> <b> ""Ecstasy to Frenzy"":</b> Fits seamlessly between ""Crimson and Clover"" and <i>Forever Changes</i>.
    The disc's best ""straight"" song, even if it's quaazonked.<p>
<li> <b>""All You Need Is a Fertile Mind"":</b> A touching (tee-hee) indictment of pornography, espousing a
    healthier masturbatory ethic of pretending.  Why feed a ""woman like Venus"" when you could just ""unwind""
    to the fantasy that your hand is a dream-cootch?  When the backup singers kick in, decrying ""material
    waste of photography,"" you'll know in your rank heart that the smut-kings are but brainwashers.<p>
<li> <b>""Gretchen's New Dish"":</b> Wow. Wow. Oh man. Whew. Wow. Possibly the catchiest celebration of
    pedophile incest scat-crimes yet, beating out even Whitney Houston's ""The Greatest Love of All"".  A
    six-year-old ""full of doodoo""`gets a present that a ""liquid swish"" lights up, just like ""Pa does his
    mustache cup.""  I can't stop singing it.  The children really are the future, I decided long ago.<p>
<li> <b>""Blind Man's Penis"":</b> I hope my mom isn't reading this review.  These lyrics aren't honest;
    they're by someone who sent them in to see how far the song-poem orchestras would go for a vanity-buck.
    This anthem is about warts and nipples and zebras and Nazis and erections and gelatin-fingers.  Recommended

Skin.  Blood.  Cheers.  This would prove to be a common sequence of events for the greatest boxer in
    history, Muhammad Ali.  While sports historians never forget to mention his ability as a fighter, most will
    recall that he partially made his name by talking shit.  From one Ali to another, the tradition continues.
    This time in the visage of a young Brother with two red eyes, pale white skin, a black soul and what I
    believe can safely be called one of the year's best albums.</p><p>
    
    A Molotov cocktail of Nas' chipped-toothed storyteller, Slug's introspective emo-thug, and Common Sense's
    wordplay aficionado, Brother Ali has clearly studied the album structures of mid-90s masters.  From the
    urine-soaked authenticity of his portrayal of inner city Minneapolis life (""Room with a View"") to the
    staggering detail of a conflict with his wife-beating neighbor (""Dorian"") to a bass monster spiritual alloy
    of The Legion's ""Jingle Jangle"" and Atmosphere's ""Flesh"", where he claims to be ""a cross between John Gotti
    and Mahatma Gandhi"" (""Bitchslap""), Ali focuses his powerful delivery equally on reality-based depth charges
    and classic rap braggadocio.  In this regard, Brother Ali truly is the bad motherfucker his <i>nom de plume</i>
    ancestor was.  On ""When the Beat Comes In"", he claims to be, ""A big teddy bear/ Until they scream 'stop
    slamming the car door, that's my fucking head in there!'"" and, subsequently, tells an invisible adversary
    that he'll ""serve your family and write about it in my journal like I'm Mr. Belvedere.""</p><p>
    
    Brother Ali made a name for himself through freestyle competitions and mind-blowing live shows, and this
    energy translates well to the compact disc format.  His greatest power lies within his sedimentary flow.
    His rhyme schemes skit and scat across instrumentals like pebbles breaking waves on the beach, while his
    sheer force-of-will cadence drags this album into the upper echelon.  When Ali tells you that he's ""walking
    tall enough to make your half-moon whole,"" he says it with the confidence of a man that just stuffed the
    ballot box.</p><p>
    
    Although the focus is consistently directed to Mr. Ali's magnetic delivery, props must be given to
    Atmosphere's Ant for his most consistent production to date.  While his work with Slug has typically been
    hit (""Flesh"", ""Guns and Cigarettes"") or miss (""Tears for the Sheep""), this album is more or less flawless
    instrumentally.  Clearly influenced by the RZA, and more recently, Rocafella associates Kanye West and
    Just Blaze, Ant has finally surrounded his single drumkit with samples that distract from his trademark
    headphone-destroying snare.  The cheery church organ flourish of ""Forest Whitaker"" and the ridiculously
    smooth flute-guitar battle of ""Star Quality"" both exemplify Ant's sudden willingness to diversify his
    portfolio.</p><p>
    
    Granted, not every beat is completely rock solid, and some of the most interesting tracks end far too
    quickly (""Forest Whitaker"" was a verse away from being the best song about living with Albinism ever,
    while Ali's collab with Slug, ""Missing Teeth"", sports one of the best beats on the album, but only lasts
    for less than two minutes), but when these kinds of minor issues are an album's only shortcomings, you
    tend to look past them.  <i>Shadows on the Sun</i> one-ups Ali's already sick debut, and proves him one
    of the first great voices to emerge from the underground so far this century.</p></div>"|1066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1066-shadows-on-the-sun/|8.7|Rollie Pemberton

    torpedoes and talk about how cool someone is. Someone whose music is all bang-buzz gob-growl happy-go-lucky
    tech-punk bounce, slathered with burned-chunky motor oil from evil cartoon dumptrucks and yet in very little
    need of any prettying-up. This particular someone: Marco Haas, recording as T. Raumschmiere. And this
    particular album: a pretty good one.</p><p>
    Raumschmiere's notable skill is this: he rocks out. Not in a mean way, or anything-- there's a friendly,
    invitingly deranged quality to his jumparound brutalism-- but the guy certainly likes to make
    four-on-the-floor a snarly, happy, fist-raising experience, and it's said that his live shows are
    energetic enough for audiences to fear for the safety of his equipment. Here on <i>Radio Blackout</i>,
    we come across what just might be the crown to his line-so-far of joybanging singles and especially
    remixes (of Goldfrapp, Komëit, 2raumwohnung): ""Monstertruckdriver"", the track one imagines led the <i>New
    York Times</i> itself to compare his music to ""a monster truck rolling through a rave."" (And this was even
    after they resumed double-checking to make sure their stories were, like, true: you can't argue with that.)</p><p>
    ""Monstertruckdriver"" is the Raumschmierian tech single in its pure form-- it kicks in with the shuffling
    glam beat that's infected plenty of folks on his own Shitkatapult label; it brings in steady blurts of the
    grotty bass speedbump he clearly loves; the lead comes in buzzy, but bounces melodically like he got the
    idea from <i>Sesame Street</i>. You know those heavy metal devil-chick-on-muscle-car animations? It's like
    that, only without the bad metal.</p><p>
    The thing about <i>Radio Blackout</i>: more than the sterile, precision-molded minimal techno of last year's
    <i>Anti</i>, and more than the clunkier brute scraping of the previous year's <i>The Great Rock'n'Roll
    Swindle</i>, this is Raumschmiere as the ready-for-prime-time singles artist. It opens fairly dirty and
    streamlined, but in a preparatory way; ""Monstertruckdriver"" revs up in the second slot. ""Someday"" wanders
    rather prettily around a slow-creeping beat, taking its tech-tweaking and IDM-type rhythm variations at a
    casual pace; ""The Game Is Not Over"" sort of reprises ""Monstertruckdriver"" at four, only now with the usually
    flat-voiced Miss Kittin pouncing and sneering over it in a way that's scarily reminiscent of Adult.'s Nicola
    Kuperus. (""Highway rock and roll disaster!"") The back and forth that leads through the first half of the
    album-- dancefloor exciter, subtler moodpiece, and repeat-- is so simple it just does work: I think
    Raumschmiere's got my attention span matched near-exactly.</p><p>
    Not that there's anything wrong with the mood pieces-- the title track, just floating ambience and ghostly
    radio static, is a great lull, and ""Drown in the Sea While Watching the Stars"" pulls off a nice combination
    of sultry vibe and metallic scraping. It all just hangs together surprisingly well, full of interesting
    diversions: ""Rabaukendisco"" pairs a great big rock grind with screaming saxophones; ""Wir Kinder Vom Bahnhof
    Strom"" and ""Querstromzerspaner"" offer some terrifically assembled mid-pace techno for a return to the
    dancefloor-appropriate; ""A Million Brothers (Blah Blah Blah)"" even takes a curiously okay shot at hip-hop,
    though the ""blah blah blah"" might as well apply to guest MC Soom T's heard-it-before criticisms of government.
    (She's from Glasgow, and this track is a bit too much like Tricky once the paranoia started slowing down the
    creativity.)</p><p>
    At its most interesting, <i>Radio Blackout</i> lets Raumschmiere do exactly what an album should let him do:
    work around whichever edges of his terrific singles sound aren't entirely appropriate for a club floor. I'm
    sure the folks at Mute are damned happy with that, and I am too-- it's nice to hear a full-length that
    captures what the man's known for quite so efficiently.</p></div>"|6694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6694-radio-blackout/|8.0|Nitsuh Abebe

    should probably know straight off what you're getting into.  The key word here would be ""heart"" (not
    coincidentally the name of the album), as in ""wears on his sleeve"" or ""in her mouth"" or ""-shaped candies
    with cute little phrases on them.""  Stars have come to rock the master of your cardiovascular system, and
    if you're not prepared to accommodate a healthy serving of lyrical earnestness, you should probably just
    Remove All from your Winamp and go play some street hockey, you manly man you.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately for whoever remains, that leadoff track (""What the Snowman Learned About Love""-- see what I'm
    saying?) then supernovas into a synthy planetarium soundtrack worthy of M83 before scaling back to a delicate
    sing-song in the vein of Broken Social Scene's ""Anthems for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl"".  It's a fitting
    overture to a strong pop album that effortlessly shifts from bombastic chamber to plink-plink twee over
    eleven songs, blissfully unburdened by the ambition to sound particularly new or different.  In fact, I
    doubt the band would even mind much being referred to as a Canadian Belle &amp; Sebastian, albeit a B&amp;S; with
    more 80s synth-- which, come to think of it, might just be what the new Trevor Horn-mentored Belles will
    sound like.</p><p>
    
    But one song form Belle &amp; Sebastian were never real strong with was the boy/girl conversational duet (think
    ""Don't You Want Me?""), and Stars are happy to fill the void.  ""Elevator Love Letter"" puts a jangly frame
    around urban shyness-- she's a rich girl, he's hot for the rich girl, both have spent too much time under
    florescent lights.  ""Romantic Comedy"" is a domestic disintegration dialogue set to perky acoustic guitar
    runs and accordion.  If the subject matter sounds a bit Hallmark, well, it is, but it's so persistently
    romantic that it should just about reach the level of excusably cornball for emotion-arbiters, like the
    video for Air's ""All I Need"" or the final scene from <i>Field of Dreams</i>.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, the group coasts on a good amount of orchestral carpets: ""Time Can Never Kill the True Heart""
    juxtaposes the quartet with very-very-lite techno programming; ""Look Up"" is plausible Delgados forgery,
    thanks to smoky Amy Millan vocals.  But even when stripped of symphonic accouterments the act doesn't wilt;
    the polite high range of part-time actor Torquil Campbell works wonders in ""The Woods"" with just a french
    horn and an answering machine message for company.  Only when the group tries to develop some sort of
    awkward dark edge (the uncomfortably dreary lyrics of ""Death to Death"") or the sound gets nudged off the
    MOR cliff (greasy-slick ""The Life Effect"") does <i>Heart</i> skip a beat, become clogged, or experience
    any other negative heart pun of your choice.</p><p>
    
    Chalk it up perhaps to another case of Pitchfork Canuckophilia, but Stars comes as yet another Montreal
    act to keep the indie pop dream alive in '03.  Less all over the map than the Voltron-like Broken Social
    Scene, and without the fetishist spice that off-kilters the otherwise straight-shooting pop of The Hidden
    Cameras, Stars could very easily be overlooked, or avoided like a couple prone to PDA.  But as of yet
    we don't have immigration quotas on music from the Great White North, and <i>Heart</i> is a valuable pop
    record for those of us whose cardiac muscle hasn't stained completely black like that of, I dunno, Chris
    Ott.</p></div>"|7471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7471-heart/|8.4|Rob Mitchum

    released in 1995. The date didn't seem right. One reason was because Tricky's work with Massive Attack and
    his groundbreaking early singles predated the LP's release by two or three years; another is because it's
    still difficult to believe that he's been considered irrelevant for only about a mere four or five years.</p><p>
    
    It's been an unfair fall, in some ways. That's not to say that paranoid ramblings about your record label or
    a trio of disappointing to disastrous albums (<i>Angels with Dirty Faces</i>, <i>Juxtapose</i>, and
    <i>Blowback</i>) aren't grounds for turning your back on an artist. But as one of the architects of a
    much-maligned former ""now"" sound, the pressure on Tricky to stay ahead of the curve was perhaps always
    going to be an impossible burden, and so it seems that with every subsequent release, the shadow of
    <i>Maxinquaye</i> has loomed.</p><p>
    
    The recent release of the Island-issued best-of comp, <i>A Ruff Guide</i>, is a reminder that at least the
    first two of Tricky's missteps have something worth salvaging. Yet with the release of Tricky's seventh
    album, <i>Vulnerable</i>, the <i>Maxinquaye</i> comparisons are perhaps apt. Tricky's latest record seems
    to celebrate his new label and locale, and his seemingly healthier outlook on life: Instead of wading in
    a swamp of paranoia and dread, he's stepping into the light with sunnier tones, brighter hues, lilting
    strings, and even some soothing melodies. Unfortunately, this figurative new start is also literally
    reminiscent of his stunning debut, even going as far as drafting in a female vocalist (Costanza) who can't
    help but remind listeners of Tricky's original muse, Martina Topley-Bird. So after years of running into
    creative dead ends, Tricky seems as if he's retraced his steps.  The retreat to his career starting line
    is more than a bit distracting.</p><p>
<i>Vulnerable</i> does begin by hitting a few promising notes. ""Stay"" has a galloping rhythm, dub undertones,
    and playful melody, and its boy/girl lyric makes effective use of the dual vocals. (Unfortunately, Tricky's
    rasp is featured on every track, sometimes to superfluous effect.) The second and third tracks, ""Antimatter""
    and ""Ice Pick"", are even more encouraging. Each is a restrained nod to everyone's new favorite decade (that's
    the 80s)-- the former has both a curiously bubbly vocal hook and melody that wouldn't be out of place on a
    Sugababes or Girls Aloud record, and the latter has a propulsive hook. Another keeper, ""Car Crash"", is
    delicate, atmospheric, and the best showcase for Costanza's graceful voice, although it's just a Zero 7
    remix away from lapsing into chillout compilation territory.</p><p>
    
    From there, things go downhill quickly. The new-wave tangents are continued on Tricky's requisite covers,
    this time of XTC's ""Dear God"" and The Cure's ""The Love Cats"" [sic], neither of which is worth a second
    listen. Tricky's own compositions on the remainder of the record are even more problematic. A trio of stabs
    at high-octane guitar tracks-- ""How High"", ""Where I'm From"", and ""Moody""-- are clumsy and canned, a common
    result when riffs and power chords are shunted off to the side of a track rather than supplying the meat
    of a song. (And, unfortunately, those who merely dabble in guitars for those reasons seem to universally
    make them sound ham-fisted <i>and</i> bury them in the mix.)</p><p>
    
    By the end of the album, Tricky returns to acting on his worst impulses, stumbling through hackneyed sonics
    and wincing lyrics. ""Wait for God"" is a dull and simplistic anti-Christian commentary with lines like ""I
    wait for God and it's very hard."" Album closer ""Search, Search, Survive"" poorly nicks Duran Duran's ""Save a
    Prayer"" and passes off ""You're lucky alive/ You could be Aaliyah"" as sentiment. At one point in that track,
    Costanza reads an Italian translation of the song's lyric.</p><p>
    
    If this is supposed to be a new beginning for Tricky, at least that implies an acknowledgment of past sins.
    A full exorcism of his defensive inclinations and the <i>Maxinquaye</i> blueprint would be a welcome next
    step but less than a decade after his startling debut, it's hard to imagine that this once-bulletproof
    talent has the goods to offer more than the ghosts of his own past.</p></div>"|8152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8152-vulnerable/|4.9|Scott Plagenhoef

    locate a bright enough angle in the room-- perhaps changing locations-- and let each ghostly marking catch the sun. On their first full 
    length, Cobra High's willingness to insert such detail and to mesh equally subtle sonic layers into compositions pushes them 
    beyond the faux-dark edginess of such overdressed lightweights as the Faint. Avoding the pompous caricatures of their paper-thin brethren, 
    Cobra High's aesthetic know-how deepens upon repeated listens, their understated hooks lodging themselves into your frontal lobe through their 
    integral placement. Featuring eight tracks roaming in and around analog synth and drum machine, all spun through 
    guitar, bass, and actual drums, this two-year-old Seattle four piece channels New Order, Roxy Music, Cabaret Voltaire, Pere Ubu, and some less 
    vaunted 1980s Midwestern scavengers.</p><p>
    
    The album begins with three solid tracks that don't stutter anywhere in their pronunciation of that decade's more interesting half.  ""Paper Gods"" 
    inaugurates the underkill with a flashback sounding much like The Damned's ""Smash It Up"". Beyond this ringing synth introduction, the track shifts 
    focus to a rave-up akin to the vastly forgotten Naked Raygun. In fact, Naked Raygun vocalist Jeff Pezzati is one of the better comparisons for Justin 
    Schwartz's resonantly dusted baritone. The second track, ""White Diamond"", is a lyrically psychedelic dream-quest about a river; here Schwartz's smokey 
    delivery brings to mind the stand-off cool of early Urge Overkill. Blend this with the rhythmically sublime Mission of Burma rocking along to New 
    Order's stark ministrations and you'll get a sense of the track's overall arc. Rounding out the triad, the ridiculously titled prog instrumental, 
    ""Awesomology"" packs a Wire meets King Crimson wallop, though, admittedly, post Trans Am's agonizingly ironic posturing, I can muster no love for the 
    vocorder. Still, with two strikes against it, the track is a sloppily pretty whirling dervish that would've been better served if named after the 
    evocative album title.</p><p>
    
    But Cobra High set the bar too high, and much of the remainder of <i>Sunset in the Eye of the Hurricane</i> falters. ""Black Boomerang"", for example, errs noticeably on the side 
    of that particular Luxx brand of new wave. Here, the rock resonances of ""Paper Gods"" and ""White Diamond"" are ditched in favor of mewling 
    Faint-styled ponderousness; like much of that abyssmal genre, it sounds like incidental music to low-budget film noir.  ""El Fang Dorado"", on the other 
    hand, does bring the rock, but by fixating on naval-gazing math dynamics and not the outward-looking old-school charisma of the stronger work, it turns 
    into anonymous Breadwinner aping by guys with too much time on their hands to practice their scales. Worst of all, the album peters out sourly 
    with ""A Leaded Trace"", a maudlin dear-mom-and-dad bit centered around piano, distant ""angelic"" vocals, and a half-assed sing-a-long. The wimpiest XTC was 
    more explosive.</p><p>
    
    Not that it's all shit after the handshake: ""A Cut of the Money"" smartly manages the band's varied ingredients, treading a rich 
    liminal space between each layer, carving-out five minutes of hooky artiness honing-in on and honoring the furious noisemaking of Pere Ubu's 
    <i>Pennsylvania</i>. Moments like this confirm suspicions that the stronger tracks weren't a fluke.</p><p>
    
    Despite the missteps, Cobra High make it plainly obvious that too many over-determined contemporary pretenders are pillaging the wrong paths 
    through borrowed '80s record collections. For those who've always like more rock and less hairspray, you'd do yourself some historical good if you 
    searched out <i>Sunset in the Eye of the Hurricane</i> along with the band's self-titled EP on Grand Mal.  While you're at it, why not absorb a bit 
    of the band's smartly evoked influences?</p></div>"|1718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1718-sunset-in-the-eye-of-the-hurricane/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

    [Excerpted from ""<i>quebec</i>: Journey to the center of Ween""]</p><p>
<b>Methcathinone (""Speed"" derivative, in common parlance):</b> Total inability to relax or concentrate for
    any length of time.  ""It's Gonna Be a Long Night"" takes on elevated significance; listened compulsively on
    repeat for fifty-one hours (1,080 repetitions).  Throbbing rockabilly-by-way-of-cheese-metal riffs carried
    over from Moistboyz side project opened the album almost as well as the fondly remembered ""You Fucked Up""
    opened <i>GodWeenSatan</i>.  Made me want to set my room on fire; instead I repainted it twice, both times
    blue, as Gene sang directly to me, ""Don't call your mother/ Don't call a priest/ Don't call the doctor/
    Call the police/ You bring the razor blade/ I'll bring the speed/ It's gonna be a long night.""  Other songs
    not listened to.</p><p>
<b>Oxycontin (Painkiller):</b> ""Zoloft"" is nice.  Sat motionless three inches above the couch, vaguely
    nauseated, while ""Zoloft""'s loopy, wavy percussion, harp-like flutterings, and lounge keyboards kept me
    floating sedately.  Almost laughed when Dean sang about sucking down Zoloft, but then didn't feel like it.
    Almost thought it sounded forced, like a gratuitous inclusion for people who expected another quirky track
    like ""The HIV Song"", but then didn't feel like it.  Total tropical hammock-style, piña colada relaxation.
    The weird pixie voices in the background almost scared me, but then I didn't feel like it.</p><p>
<b>Nitrous Oxide (N2O):</b> Mixed effect.  The total randomness of the album's first half-- from metal-blade
    racket, to classic rock nostalgia, to full-on whacked-out Ween-ness-- is all hilariously near-perfect Ween.
    Even the name makes me giggle.  Ween.  Heh.  The Vaudevillian theatrics of ""Hey There Fancypants"" made me
    wet myself with laughter, but it stopped there.  Even on nitrous, the tired, prog-influenced back end of
    <i>quebec</i> isn't very funny.</p><p>
<b>Cannibis (Marijuana):</b> I totally get it.  It all makes sense now, man...  On ""Captain"", they're not
    just, like, ripping off Floyd's massive orchestral swells and psychedelic haze; they're channeling it, you
    know?  Ween, like, goofs on that wacky shit like the creepy vibes of ""Happy Colored Marbles"", but they left
    their hearts back in the 60s; the overblown classic rock sweep is the true Ween.  The apocalyptic build of
    ""If You Could Save Yourself (You'd Save Us All)"" is vintage, <i>Ziggy</i>-caliber Bowie, ""The Argus"", and
    it's still, like... but the most boring track of all, ""Alcan Road"", in which there's nothing but
    hollowed-out, windy drone for, like, ever is cool, on pot.  Even the indecipherable, thrashing noise at
    the tempestuous center of ""So Many People in My Neighborhood"" is brilliant as a break from the way serious
    psychedelic guitar washes, sitars, and underwater vocals of tracks like the aptly named ""Tried and True"".
    It's a total bummer, too, 'cause when I'm sober I like ""crazy Ween"" a whole lot more than ""sincere-ish
    Ween,"" and there's a whole lot more of the latter on this album.  I'm gonna need more pot.</p><p>
<b>Diacetylmorphine (Heroin):</b> No effect.  Passed out; threw up in my own mouth.</p><p>

    [Excerpted from my soon-to-be-published biography, <i>Nancy Reagan: Wolf in a Sheep's Hairdo</i>]</p><p>
    And lo! she approached the podium, and thus spake to the doe-eyed graduating class of Winnemack University,
    1982:</p><p>
    ""Graduating class of 1982, hear me!  Just say 'No' to drugs!  I never took drugs, and I'm First Lady of the
    most powerful nation in the world!  I had sex with the President!  The hippies lost!  No one listens to that
    freaky, burnout ""progressive rock"" anymore!  Really, no one even cares about Pink Floyd or Jethro Tull!""</p><p>
    She didn't talk about the graduation, or the future, or anything; most heard her message, but some did not.
    Were Gene and Dean Ween in the audience that day?  Did they even go to college?  I don't know, but I do know
    this: By the time they finally burned through whatever stash they had and got around to making <i>quebec</i>,
    they learned a few lessons, and did some growing up along the way.  They can still sell crazy with the best
    of 'em, and they do, for a while; when they calm down a little, though, suddenly lines like, ""I'm makin'
    time/ Breakin' ground/ Greyhound Bus to chocolate town,"" are still good for a chuckle, but there's a
    disturbingly genuine honesty underlying it all, and the beautiful echoes of the cascading solo to conclude
    ""I Don't Want It"" will kill any hint of cynicism in even the blackest heart.  But back to Nancy...</p><p>

    [Excerpted from the review most people probably wished I had written]</p><p>
    I don't think anyone who already has some notion of wanting <i>quebec</i> could possibly be disappointed--
    it's the genre-defying psych of <i>The Mollusk</i> and the incongruous irreverence of <i>12 Golden Country
    Greats</i>, and some of the madness that is <i>GodWeenSatan</i>, and it's a lot better than the go-nowhere
    <i>White Pepper</i>, but nothing I say makes any difference.  It's Ween.  Their fans adore them, and the
    rest of you don't care.</p></div>"|8605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8605-quebec/|7.7|Eric Carr

    Tomlab.  Most of Enrico Wuttke's tracks (for he is Flim) were built around
    minimal piano melodies, with hints of synthesis added here and there. The
    Brian Eno/Harold Budd release <i>The Plateaux of Mirror</i> was one reference
    point, with a bit more processing and the occasional addition of beats. It
    was a fine record that stood apart from the bedroom IDM world it was lumped
    with-- it just didn't sound like anything else. Guitar-based laptop folktronica
    is everywhere at the moment; Wuttke is one of the few artists applying these
    same ideas (deconstructing and rearranging the deep associations bound up
    inside the tone of a familiar instrument) to the ancient, cumbersome piano.</p><p>
    
    The follow-up album, <i>Helio</i>, is considerably more varied and ultimately
    more in line with Tomlab's catalog with its computer-based sound, but there
    remains a unique edge to Flim. Synthetic sounds now dominate and the piano
    becomes a baseline reference sound that comes and goes. ""How I Trashed My Knees""
    beings the album, oddly enough, with a droning harmonium melody, but before
    the track disappears down a dark Grubbs-ian hole of endlessly held tones, a
    pop bassline and shakers come in, reminders that Flim works in the realm of
    instrumental pop. The piano doesn't even make an appearance until three
    minutes in, at which point Wuttke taps away on a tension-building cluster of
    notes, and then the drones recede and Wuttke finds solace in a pattern only
    slightly more complicated than ""Chopsticks"". ""How I Trashed My Knees"" introduces
    the more dynamic and layered version of Flim.</p><p>
    
    The most arresting moments on <i>Helio</i> come when the sound of the piano
    is tweaked and rendered as imperfect and malleable as the surrounding
    electronics. The keyboard is recorded so high on ""Conversation"" that a
    mist of red distortion surrounds each note, bringing the sound of wood
    soundboards and steel wires completely into the electrical realm. ""Snow
    Behind My Chair"" achieves a similar effect.  Both of these tracks go for
    an innocent music-box melody vibe, but ""New Livingin"" shows another side
    of Flim, with booming, distorted drums and a punchy keyboard riff that
    dissolves into a swirl of delicate feedback for its coda.</p><p>
    
    Occasionally, <i>Helio</i> veers even further into abrasive territory.
    The midrange drone of ""For Fred"" almost seems designed to irritate the
    ear, although at low volume you'd never know it-- and the fact that it
    serves as a counterpoint to a minimal piano bit along with more huge
    percussion makes it more tolerable. No question, <i>Helio</i> is all
    over the place, a serious departure from Flim's debut.  It's inevitably
    less consistent, but the range of material here points to many potentially
    intriguing future records.</p></div>"|3100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3100-helio/|7.4|Mark Richardson

Appetit!</i>, was the first post-Scissor Girls offering from AZ
    (also known as Azita Youssefi), and offered a restrained and refined take on the jagged and frayed chaos the
    Girls were best known for.  This current offering, the second and final Bride of No No record, comes on the
    heels of Azita's newest record, <i>Enantiodromia</i>, and offers even more refinement, owing more to the
    laidback acerbic cool of Steely Dan than the scatological indignation of The Fall.  Knowing that <i>II</i>
    was actually produced between <i>B.O.N.N. Appetit!</i> and Azita's newest album, it's not surprising to
    learn that it serves as a bridge between the Bride's loose interpretation of rock and Azita's Bowie-esque
    balladry.</p><p>
    My first impressions of the record made me think this was a bridge best left burned.  The music sounded stiff
    and inept.  Azita's singing, already something of an acquired taste, sounded particularly wretched, her atonal
    cawing and yawping more affected than affecting.  And the addition of a piano to certain tracks brought to
    mind unflattering, cacophonous thoughts of <i>B.O.N.N. Appetit!</i> and <i>Enantiodromia</i> playing
    simultaneously at unbearable volumes.</p><p>
    A track like ""Slugville"" was a prime offender in this regard-- it starts with some distorted guitar, and
    then begins to shamble along, with some piano along for the halting ride.  After two minutes of stumbling,
    the song switches gears, grinding against itself before going for a brief jaunt, and then concluding with
    a reprisal of the introductory shamble.  And, of course, there's Azita, mewling about the best show on earth
    being free or some such nonsense.  It sounded awful, chaotic in the worst possible way, ill-formed and
    misbegotten.</p><p>
    But then I gave it another listen.  I noticed how the instrumentation, for all its shoddiness and seeming
    ineptitude, stayed steady, established a pattern, propelled this sluggish song.  In fact, all the elements
    of the song-- the lazy leaden guitar soloing, the drunken piano, the stumblebum drums-- act like things
    you'd hear in an ordinary blues lament.  In this light, the piano I heard as superfluous and distracting
    actually lends this thudding track some necessary buoyancy, and also anchors the tempo changes.</p><p>
    If you can listen past some cosmetic ugliness, there's plenty of other rewards to be found on this album.
    ""Proven Formula"" doesn't actually offer one, but instead gives you three songs within its five minute frame.
    ""Wait a Min"" is the closest this record comes to conventionally rocking out, though it's still not all that
    conventional.  The ten minutes of ""Piano One"" switch between tortured piano-led ruminations and the Bride's
    particular brand of rock (discordant, haphazard, abrasive) in the service of telling a not-so-simple story--
    ""It's all right that you go/ I would follow... Watch as the film runs slo-mo/ To catch a bigger man than you
    or I/ To be the bigger man than you'd like.""  And, in case you're hankering for something that's readily
    accessible, the 3\xBD minutes of ""Piano Intro"" are without a doubt the most beautiful moments this record has
    to offer.  For the folks out there willing to work and give this record a chance, it's a just reward.</p></div>"|932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/932-ii/|7.2|David Raposa

We expect personal truths and broad revelations from musicians, but we
    often expect these insights should be delivered through a mundane, relatable form of honesty.  Sure, singers often borrow words, ideas and emotions from the experiences
    of others, ranging from friends and family to long-dead or non-existent cultural and historical figures.  But these identities are almost always kept somehow separate
    from that of the singer, who in turn manipulates these secondary personas into acceptable personal statements and observations.</p><p>
    
    Though Carey Mercer's voice is heard throughout <i>The Golden River</i>, the identity of the album's narrator always seems to be shifting and slipping.  The album
    is less a work of cognizant storytelling than a fever dream.  Personal and cultural memory bleed together, as Mercer spins fractured images lifted straight from the pages of
    Grimm Brothers fairy tales and Homeric Epics.  And yet, nothing about <i>The Golden River</i> seems contrived or gratuitously literary: its otherworldly sonic and
    lyric richness is matched at every turn by the striking immediacy of Mercer's wide-eyed delivery.  The result is a record every bit as stunning and imaginative as it is
    memorable and affecting, and one of the most unique and interesting I've heard in ages.</p><p>
    
    ""One in Six Children Will Flee in Boats"" opens the album with a flimsy, strummed guitar figure that's immediately, strikingly overshadowed by Mercer's breathy gasp.
    Suddenly, a rich swell of guitar, drums, and keyboards evokes a grandiosity bringing to mind glam-era Bowie; Mercer captures the Thin White Duke's anthemic and melodic
    delivery, but couples it with a frenzied, grizzled intensity and the gruff, world-weary sensibility of Tom Waits.  Mercer matches this intensity lyrically, singing ""Over that ridge,
    a hunter lives/ Stake him out with broken gifts/ By the light, by the merry men/ Who gave his lives when he gave knives to children/ Raise him up, stake him up/ Grab the
    sun and drink his blood in cups!""  Out of context, it may seem nonsensical, but the conviction with which Mercer sings renders it an unnervingly powerful image.</p><p>
    
    After an ethereal instrumental break, ""Time Reveals Its Plan at Poisoned Falls"" plays up the operatic nature of Mercer's voice, as he rattles off funhouse mirror images of a
    royal court and hissed accusations of jealousy.  Rather than simply sounding crazy, he conveys the doomed frenzy of a prophet.  About halfway through the song, he
    sings as if possessed by the spirit of the monarch whose death he has forseen: ""I'm the head of the queen/ I float around the night unseen/ And I know when to scream
    'oh baby wake up!'""  At a mere 1:29, ""Time Reveals Its Plan at Poisoned Falls"" is both a vivid fantasy and a desperate plea to return to consciousness and reality, a potent
    juxtaposition that Mercer hints at throughout the record.</p><p>
    
    A procession of similarly strong songs follows, each one sonically rich and brimming with melody and imagination.  Only  ""Orbis Magnus"" temporarily shifts the tone of the
    record to one of unadulterated, introspective sadness.  In a subdued mumble, Mercer intones: ""You can have boyfriends, but not men/ You want your words to be penned/
    There's women on the barge, on the waters that bend.""  Here, Mercer seems to embody the timeless trope of the lonely monster, his previous outbursts reduced to a
    barely-contained air of self-loathing.</p><p>
<i>The Golden River</i> closes with two of its strongest tracks.  ""World's Greatest Concertos"" is a fit of gleeful self-destruction, as if Mercer has finally been driven mad by the images
    he has seen, shouting ""Encapsulate the body and emasculate the body/ And hold the burning waters, the tubs of burning waters/ Holiday!/ The trees are bones and dipped in
    wazing burning cones and call a celebration/ The master's burnt in his burning station.""  Mercer's shrieking falsetto it segues into the sublime ""Picture Framing the Gigantic Men
    Who Fought on Steam Boats"", the most beautiful song on <i>The Golden River</i> and also quite possibly the most unsettling.  The vocals are slightly more subdued here,
    cushioned by breathy backup singing provided by Carolyn Mark.  Right before it ends, ""Picture Framing"" takes on a somber and ominous tone, as Mercer repeats,
    ""I'll keep on sailing on/ Until the rosy-pink dawn,"" cleverly citing a Homeric epithet to suggest that his voyage will, in fact, never really end.  It's a stunning moment of resignation,
    as the narrator accepts his place in this terrifyingly vivid fantasy world. </p><p>
    
    This album seems to exist in a world apart from our own.  From Melanie Campbell's insistent, simple, and often strangely cartoonish drumming to Carey Mercer's
    fantastical lyrics and overwrought delivery, <i>The Golden River</i> taps directly into your imagination, short-circuiting any traditional notions of what should constitute ""sincere"" and
    ""emotional"" music.  These songs are the lost soundtracks to those frantic, epic dreams that you can never remember in their entirety, but stay with you for the rest of your life.</p></div>"|3265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3265-the-golden-river/|9.1|Matt LeMay

    of the past half-century: Sun Ra, George Clinton, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry-- it's an elite club, but by no means an exclusive one.
    What sets these artists apart from their contemporaries and/or imitators is the fact that their effortless, genuine material occupyies the fringes of
    acceptable musicality without ever sounding pretentious; they translate their visions direct to tape and send them out into the world to fend for themselves.  
    By definition, such prophets are prolific, and usually to a fault: who has time to edit existing ideas when there are already a dozen more waiting to be made musical flesh?
    It's a curse/blessing that makes for horribly inconsistent discographies with two or three full-out flops for every single flash of brilliance.</p><p>
    
    In less than ten years, Madlib has proven himself a logical heir to this peculiar tradition. He's already got more projects under his belt than
    Sun Ra had hats.  Beginning with his role as emcee and producer with the Oxnard, CA-based Lootpack, Madlib has gone on to infiltrate the musical
    consciousness with an entire backpack worth of aliases: the helium-blunted rapper Quasimoto, the one-man nu-jazz band Yesterday's New
    Quintet, and collaborations under his more common name with Jaydee (Jaylib) and MF Doom (Madvillian).  Like the aforementioned
    auteurs, Madlib's projects have their share of hits and misses, but the creativity and lack of stultifying concern for critical assessment 
    clearly shows there's a lot more coming down the line.</p><p>
    
    It's a bit of a surprise, then, that an artist as multi-faceted as Madlib was invited into the dank catacombs of the original Blue Note master tapes for a ""remix""
    project.  Though he's certainly not the first to gain access to the house that Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff built, his predecessors-- Pete Rock, Biz
    Markie, Us3-- were cut from a considerably safer cloth; which presumably explains the decision to package the results as Madlib ""invading"" the Blue
    Note catalog, just in case his unpredictability happened to get the best of him.  But, gentle executives, your gamble pays
    off two-fold: Madlib gets a shot at a significantly wider audience <em>and</em> the label has an opportunity to redeem itself for all those Kurt
    Elling and Joe Lovano records they've been haplessly peddling since the early 90s.</p><p>
    
    Appropriately enough, Madlib's multiple personality disorder creates the ""shades of blue"" the title refers to.  On one hand, he stars as himself,
    semi-dutifully remixing Blue Note classics by Gene Harris &amp; The Three Sounds, Donald Byrd, Ronnie Foster and Bobby Hutcherson into outsider works
    of downtempo and instrumental hip-hop art.  With the exception of Bobbi Humphrey's ""Please Set Me At Ease""-- which Madlib and guest emcee Medaphoar
    transform into Slum Village hip-hop-- there's nothing overtly radical about the remixes, but closer listening reveals strange happenings in their murky
    depths, as the role reversal of foregrounded breakbeat and buried melody on the disc's centerpiece ""Stepping Into Tomorrow"" illustrate exquisitely.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the tracks are ""new interpretations of Blue Note classics"" by Yesterday's New Quintet and its offshoot ensembles Morgan Adams
    Quartet Plus Two, Sound Direction and the Joe McDuphrey Experience.  Don't be fooled: this is entirely the work of Madlib and his uncanny ability to play
    a disorienting number of instruments, and his equally clever habit of inventing names for each member of the fictional band(s).  As a result,
    these pieces are slightly more linear in construction, relying more on harmony and tempo dynamics than the loops upon which the remixes are largely
    built, but are similarly genius in terms of both concept and execution. Madlib even goes so far as to fake a live recording for the Joe McDuphrey
    Experience's medley of Horace Silver's ""Peace"" and Herbie Hancock's ""Dolphin Dance"", only to give himself away by chopping up the mix beyond 
    recognition in the middle of the piece.</p><p>
    
    Judging from the results of this encounter, I'd like to see Madlib let loose upon the Saturn catalog, or crafting a Yesterday's New Quintet record of
    Parliament-Funkadelic tunes like the one he concocted in tribute to Stevie Wonder last year.  But if his creative impulse moves along at anything
    remotely attuned to the speed it has so far, I'm sure there'll be five or six more Madlib-helmed records to sort through every year from here to
    Armageddon as he hits and misses his way to defining his own Black radical cosmology.</p></div>"|5541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5541-shades-of-blue-madlib-invades-blue-note/|8.6|Scott Hreha

Anyone who's ever synched up a Beach Boys 
    track to a spitting blizzard gets that those kinds of temporal assignments can be awfully limiting, but there's something 
    intensely beach-blanket/windows-down about <i>Twice</i>-- the Tyde's snarkily-titled follow-up to their 2001 debut <i>Once</i>-- 
    that seems to make pigeonholing inevitable.  Boasting all the smooth, amber glow of a Beachwood Sparks record (evidence 
    three overlapping members), but hardly any of Beachwood's salty, shaking twang, <i>Twice</i> evokes only the clearest of deep, 
    California skies, all crickets and moonlight, warm beer and bonfires, sticky fingers and splintering boardwalks.  Pack it in a bag with 
    your sandy beach towels and cracked goggles, surf wax and weed; dewy, power-popped, and properly hooked, <i>Twice</i> 
    is culled from glossy picture postcards and cheap hotel rooms. It's forty minutes of straight summer soundtrack.</p><p>
    
    Thematically, <i>Twice</i> marries the 60s psych-pop of <i>Once</i> with late-70s/early-80s cult jams, incorporating big nods to Felt and 
    Television Personalities, relying less heavily on blatant homage to the Flying Burrito Brothers and Buffalo Springfield, and finding 
    room for a single, victorious holler to the Velvets: ""Henry VIII"" finds frontman Darren Rademaker twisting his mouth into his best Lou 
    Reed glower, shouting about the impossibility of life with/without drugs (""We just won't stop/ We don't stop/ Sometimes everybody 
    needs a friend"") and layering thick, jangly guitars over spare, jumpy percussion.  Rademaker's carefully effects-laden vocals 
    occasionally sputter like a less pouty Julian Casablancas', deliberately retro but still intensely likeable, all lazy nuance 
    and mellow sighs.</p><p>
    
    There's not too much here to knock the sprinkles off your ice cream cone, but <i>Twice</i> is an impressively consistent and well-
    crafted collection: ""Best Intentions"" is five minutes of slow, artful meandering, languid and 
    peaceably anchored by lilting guitar while ""Blood Brothers"" (despite the fairly wince-inducing lyric ""Do you want to 
    know what it feels like to be a man?/ Try spending twenty-five years in a band"") is a rousing, organ-riddled salute to old-
    fashioned, back-slapping brotherhood.</p><p>
      
    The Tyde have effectively shifted British post-punk from the dim, rainy streets of England to the broad, sunny avenues of California, 
    trading vague melancholy for relaxed grins.  Rhodes, piano, lap steel and synths add some interesting textures, but <i>Twice</i> still 
    suffers from the predictability inherent in direct transplantation-- nearly every track can be quickly linked back to the 
    artist or year that inspired it, and while the Tyde's contemporary re-interpretations are perfectly pleasant, they're not always 
    compelling enough to let the shameless co-opting pass unnoticed.  Like summer itself, <i>Twice</i> is peripheral, contingent upon the other 
    eight months of the year for its bold existence, destined to be remembered, come autumn, as a fleeting, sweet, and delightfully 
    innocuous burst of light. </p></div>"|8230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8230-twice/|7.0|Amanda Petrusich

Perhaps spurred on by the warm reception (after a short 
    of period of inactivity), Ralf Hutter, Florian Schneider, Karl Bartos and Wolfgang Flur set out working on a forthcoming album, to be titled <em>Technopop</em>.  
    <em>Technopop</em> was to feature songs including its title track and ""Sex Object"", which would later surface on 1986's <em>Electric Café</em>.  Its first single was to 
    have been ""Tour de France"", and that track was in fact released in 1983.  However, <em>Technopop</em> was not to be: due to a series of circumstances-- not 
    least of which, Hutter's bicycle accident, which kept him out of serious action for the better part of a year-- the band decided to stretch their 
    deadline, incorporate a few more state-of-1986 recording techniques (including, gasp, sampling) and concentrate their full length ideas on 
    <em>Electric Café</em>.  ""Tour de France""-- not a particularly classic entry in their singles catalog in the first place-- was left to drift into nothingness, and all was 
    tidily swept under the mouse pad.</p><p>
    But you know Kraftwerk have never been ones to let perfectly customizable data lay unaltered.  From the time Hutter and Schneider hooked up in 
    Düsseldorf in the late 60s to their heyday of the late 70s/early 80s and on through their complete catalog reworking (1991's <em>The Mix</em>), Kraftwerk 
    have been a model of efficiently planned obsolescence.  Taking a page from fellow tech-freak George Lucas (and Bill Gates for that matter), they don't 
    even want to make their earliest releases available, making sure all client-side installations have been successfully updated to the most recent 
    Kraftwerk sound.</p><p>
    To their credit, Kraftwerk have a knack for emphasizing their best ideas, as almost all of their records from <em>Autobahn</em> until <em>Computer World</em> are dazzling 
    specimens of the single-minded desire to progress, and the synergy of four pretty distinct individuals.  What's more, they're pop.  Unlike virtually 
    any other band from the first wave of Krautrock, Kraftwerk produced music that worked as both experimental museum piece and a dancefloor (or living 
    room) beacon.  They are like the Beatles of electronic music: inspirations to NPR coffee talkers, crusty academic types and regular folks who just want 
    to get robotic every now and again.
    </p><p>
    So what a disappointment it must seem to witness the band rework ""Tour de France"" and slap a few new tracks down for their ""new"" LP, a 
    soundtrack to the annual cycling event.  I mean, in this fertile era for electronic music, when so many sounds seem ripe for the next revolution, you 
    would think the godfathers of the genre would be serving up more than leftovers for our digital consumption.  In fact, when the three-part ""Tour 
    de France"" single was released earlier this year, many fans were disappointed: it would take more than modern tweaking to turn its thin 
    melody and almost non-existent lyrical concerns (even for Kraftwerk) into something interesting.  Bet step back-- perhaps surprisingly, Kraftwerk 
    still have a few tricks up their sleeves.  Their latest LP may not pack the same fortune-telling punch of their classic records, but it is nevertheless 
    a distinctly engaging, sophisticated experience.  And I think ""sophisticated"" is ultimately the perfect word for Kraftwerk, able to forge 
    beautiful, instinctively appealing sounds out of mercilessly mechanical processes.
    </p>
<p>
    After the short synth-driven ""Prologue"", the album begins with the title track, divided into three parts.  ""Tour de France Etape 1"" starts as a 
    fairly quick, light splash of microhouse featuring patented vocoder vocalizations stating the title, and various stages of the actual race.  
    There really isn't a melody per se, except for a recurring synth line sounding not unlike one of the perky jingles used as the soundtrack for your 
    computer booting up.  ""Etape 2"" modifies the texture slightly, with flanged effects panning across the mix and subtle harmony vocals, but otherwise 
    proceeds unchanged; ""Etape 3"" drops a glittery, arpeggiated synth figure to start, but soon returns to the main theme of the first section.  All three 
    pieces are clearly part of one large ""Tour de France"" mega-mix, and probably work best when you opt to appreciate the small details instead of looking 
    for epiphanies in the beats or hooks.
    </p>
<p>
    Things get a lot more active on the second half of the record, as tunes like ""Vitamin"" and ""Aero Dynamik""/""Titanium"" sparkle from the ever-pristine 
    Kraftwerk polish.  The latter tunes are practically perfect realizations of the power of a minimal, uncluttered mix of activity when you know how to 
    highlight a beat (hint: they do). The calculated resonance of each percussive ping probably deserves its own article in a journal for 
    electronic music, but we're free to just let them go by and by and by.  ""Vitamin"" begins with an extroverted, constantly modulated synth line and 
    fluttery, reverb-drenched chord cluster over which a patented Kraftwerk bot-beat runs its course.  Similar to the title suite, the song works its 
    magic via a repetitive power of persuasion, and also similarly features an optimistic, recurring melody.
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps the only really disappointing aspect of <em>Tour de France</em>-- beyond the still-not-that-great version of the title song (which ends the album)-- is that 
    it emits a muted, comfortable aura rather than the immediately striking tone of their classic releases.  In the end, that probably won't make much 
    difference in your enjoyment of this music, but if first impressions are very important, it could be a potential turn-off for those expecting a 
    return to Kraftwerk's trailblazing status.  Sure, they might not ever be heads of the class again, but when you own the school, smart students will 
    probably listen to what you have to say anyway.

He adhered to the idea of a musician doing what he or she wants, regardless of talent or 
    precision and, along with Johnny Rotten, was the most strident believer in the idea that punk could, should, and would kill rock 'n' roll.</p><p>
    Tom Verlaine was the leader of Television, one of the earliest and most vibrant U.S. punk bands. He was an ornate guitarist and expressive vocalist with a fondness for French symbolist 
    poetry, complex arrangements, and lengthy solos.</p><p>
    These two iconic, eccentric, and disparate performers were the unlikely catalysts for Felt, one of the most enduring and oft-overlooked bands of the 1980s. Over the course of 10 years, 
    Felt released 10 singles and 10 albums, as planned by the band's offbeat leader Lawrence (née Hayward).</p><p>
    Over the course of their lifetime, Felt were nearly always out of step with UK pop. 
    When Felt started, they made glistening, reverb-heavy intricate pop while the rest of the underground was making either rhythmic and/or dark post-punk and the charts were full of clean, 
    crisp New Pop. When shambolic, jangly, bedist indie became popular in the mid-80s, Felt was making Hammond organ-heavy pop/rock. Post-Acid House, Felt released a selection of 
    cocktail jazz instrumentals á la Godard's own embrace of lounge music (<i>Train Above the City</i>) and a record of autumnal, organic beauty (<i>Me and a Monkey on the Moon</i>). Of 
    course, they never reached a large audience. Between their shifting sounds and Lawrence's oblique lyrics, they often had a difficult time retaining even their core fans. </p><p>
    In the years since, Felt hasn't been explored with the same ferocity as many of their contemporaries because they never had a single album that was settled on as their classic, as proof of their 
    genius and a succinct argument for their legend. Yet between Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch placing multiple Felt references in his lyrics and liner notes and the band's sound 
    apparent in artists such as the Sea and Cake and the Clientele, the group has, increasingly, become a chic name to drop.</p><p>
    Felt's legacy was also heightened in recent years by the unavailability of many of their key records. This year, Cherry Red-- along with Creation, one of the two label's the band recorded for 
    during its lifetime-- is redressing the situation with a full reissue campaign, re-releasing all 10 of Felt's albums, including the long out-of-print ones. To date, <i>Crumbling the Antiseptic 
    Beauty</i> and <i>The Splendour of Fear</i> have been released. Next week, Felt's Cherry Red classic <i>The Strange Idols Pattern and Other Short Stories</i> and <i>Ignite the Seven 
    Cannons</i> will be issued, with the rest of the band's catalog to follow later in the year.</p><p>
    The reissue campaign was kicked off with a collection of their best singles, b-sides, and EP tracks, <i>Stains on a Decade</i>, a rare compilation that serves both as the best introduction 
    to a band's career and a vital addition to any fans' collection. Of the songs included-- all selected by Lawrence-- only two (""Primitive Painters"" and ""Dismantled King is Off the Throne"") are 
    also featured on the band's albums. In all, <i>Stains on a Decade</i> includes 11 tracks that won't appear in any other form throughout Cherry Red's reissue campaign, and single versions
    of another two-- ""Fortune"" and ""Sunlight Bathed the Golden Glow""-- that are slightly different (and an improvement over) their more well-known album renditions.</p><p>
    In defense of the potentially superfluous tracks, no Felt singles collection would have been complete without ""Primitive Painters"", which features the Cocteau Twins' Elisabeth Fraser 
    sharing vocals with Lawrence and fellow Twin Robin Guthrie as producer. It's an ambitious, shimmering, dramatic gem and is probably the band's best-known recording. ""Dismantled 
    King Is Off the Throne"" is one of Lawrence's keenest balances of self-deprecating lyrics-- often expressions of hopelessness or fatalism colored by sheer boredom-- and original guitarist 
    Maruice Deebank's sinewy work. ""Fortune"" is a relatively minimalist for the band's Deebank-era work, but it's haunting nonetheless.</p><p>
    In their earliest days, Felt was characterized by Deebank's decorative playing and a near total lack of bass. Lawrence's flat, affected vocals and cultivated, fey, witty lyrics gave the band 
    both a sense of feminity/androgyny and an air of sophistication, like the Smiths if they were informed by the fine arts rather than Shelagh Delaney plays and 60s rock. Instead of Marresque 
    riffs, the classically trained Deebank was a virtuoso with virtually no knowledge of or concern for modern rock-- an ironic compression of Lawrence's twin musical fascinations (Godard and 
    Verlaine). The seven tracks included here from that era are all near-perfect slices of delicate, multi-layered, cerebral pop. ""Sunlight Bathed the Golden Glow"", the aforementioned ""Primitive 
    Painters"" and ""Dismantled King Is Off the Throne"", and the dark, despairing ""Penelope Tree"" are lamented lost classics.</p><p>
    Deebank eventually departed the band-- one of many lineup changes for what was essentially Lawrence's project-- in 1986. <i>Stains</i>' first post-Deebank track ""Ballad of the Band"" 
    is an intriguing confession of the frustration and a curious revelation of the group's internal squabbles. Written as a reaction to Deebank's departure, Lawrence admits that ""I feel like giving 
    in"" as he recounts the band's failed attempts at connecting with a wide audience and sarcastically blames himself for the group's lack of fame or money. After admonishing Deebank for his 
    lack of commitment to the group and his hanging out with ""Jesus freaks,"" Lawrence airs he and Deebank's artistic differences by claiming: ""There's a place for abstract and there's a place 
    for noise/ There's a place for every kind of sound."" To add further insult, the song is dominated by the Hammond of then-new member Martin Duffy (Primal Scream), whose musical 
    contributions replaced Deebank's just prior to arguably the band's strongest LP, 1986's <i>Forever Breathes the Lonely Word</i>.</p><p>
    Despite that album's success, the Creation selections on <i>Stains of a Decade</i> aren't as strong as the Cherry Red/Deebank ones. Still they're a welcome unearthing of some long largely 
    unavailable tracks. The vibrant, Hammond-led ""I Will Die With My Head in My Hands"", bittersweet, acoustic ""There's No Such Thing As Victory"", and burbling synth-pop of ""Space Blues"" highlight 
    the post-Deebank material.</p><p>
    Despite Felt's internal struggles, the constant was Lawrence's lyrics and his search for a balance between reality and perception in the hope of discovering a life worth living. ""I hold out but 
    there's no way of being what I want to be,"" he sighs on ""Primitive Painters"". ""You're trying much too hard to make your world seem like a dream"" Lawrence scolds on ""Sunlight Bathed the 
    Golden Glow"", but he's more often resigned to seeking a dream-like escape from his life and himself: ""I was lonely until I found the reason/ The reason was me.""</p><p>
    With that sense of crippling self-deprecation-- sometimes delivered with a wink, other times with his head in his hands-- Lawrence's pop world wasn't always as inviting as his band's 
    melodies suggested, but it remains captivating. More than a decade after splitting, Felt remains vital part of the UK's music history and an indie pop benchmark, and the vital <i>Stains on a 
    Decade</i>, is the first Felt collection to include all of the group's unique twists and sounds. As the compilation's title suggests, Lawrence is still dabbling in irony and self-loathing in 
    equal measure. Thankfully, though, some stains are permanent.</p></div>"|3261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3261-stains-on-a-decade/|8.7|Scott Plagenhoef

For 25 years, whenever this record has been reissued, it's been as a questionable semi-bootleg mastered from vinyl, and never endorsed by the band.      Apparently, Can want to keep this one under rug swept.  How bad can it be?</p><p>It's not a total loss. In fact, from one perspective, <em>Out of Reach</em> is an inspiration. Knowing that the godlike musical force that recorded the     <em>Tago Mago</em> --&gt; <em>Ege Bamyasi</em> --&gt; <em>Future Days</em> troika could, only a few short years later, sink to this level of awfulness makes anything seem possible. Perhaps     our lives are in a constant state of flux and any one of us might turn out a hero or a murderer, an exciting prospect, if you think about it. If Karoli,     Liebezit and Schmidt can one day decide to transform their pristine artrock rhythm machine into a beered-up and sloppy Pablo Cruise in a jammy mood,     maybe we can move equally far in the other direction.</p><p>You'll notice I made no mention of Holger Czukay-- that's 'cos he chose to be completely the fuck out of reach when the boys went into the studio to     record. He came back for <em>Inner Space</em> the following year, but wasn't a member of Can at this point. Rosko Gee, who joined in 1977 for <em>Saw Delight</em> (along with percussionist and fellow Traffic alum Rebop Kwaku Baah) handles the bass duties. His parts aren't bad, actually, and Baah's percussion is     sometimes the most interesting thing going, so there's no way to pin the blame on the Traffic guys. At this point in their career, Can just had no idea what kind of     band they wanted to be.</p>
<p>They'd dabbled with dance rhythms for a little while by 1978, but <em>Out of Reach</em> finds them going deep into Latin disco rock territory. Now, understand     something here: if someone described a band as ""Can doing Latin disco rock,"" I'd normally be all over it. The fact that these masters of space and     precision decided to explore genres known for thick layers and elasticity is a beautiful thing. It just turns out that Can are <em>not very good</em> at     Latin disco rock. At <em>all</em>.</p>
<p>Actually, when it comes to the songwriting part of the equation, they're downright terrible. The attempt at a dance hit ""Pauper's Daughter and I"" has     a tune so completely flat and lifeless, Rosko Gee's comically off-key vocals become a moot point. Honestly, it sounds like a song written     by Eddy Grant's slow brother. Weak vocals also kill the otherwise-OK lite-rock fluff ""Give Me No Roses"", whose chorus contains <em>Out of     Reach</em>'s only successful hook.</p>
<p>If ""Pauper's Daughter"" is inept, ""Like INOBE GOD"" is just weird, a kind of Latinized Calypso groove with the addition of an Abba-like studio sheen, all set      underneath what sounds like drunken, improvised chanting. If you can forget for a moment that this is actually     Can, ""Like INOBE GOD"" could be enjoyably imagined as a curious a private-press recording of a late-70s wedding band from San Diego.</p>
<p>When they're not doing disco, Can displays what can only be described as overt Santana worship, and it's significant that <em>Out of Reach</em> is actually at     its most satisfying when the band is in what Mark Prindle described as their ""Cantana"" mode. The high-energy ""Serpentine"" has some pretty cool percussion     interplay between Liebezeit and Baah (on the disco cuts the mighty Jaki just sounds bored) and Karoli's wailing guitar in ""November"" has a sense of epic,     widescreen drama. ""Seven Days Awake"" and ""One More Day"" are just bad 70s prog, ""experimental"" without any sense of playfulness or invention.</p>
<p>The label claims that this reissue of <em>Out of Reach</em> has been remastered, but at points it sounds suspiciously like a vinyl transfer. Certainly, in     addition to being Can's nadir it's also a career low for engineer Conny Plank. The mix just sounds <em>off</em> in so many places, like pieces     recorded at different times just don't match up.  Still, the difficutly in finding <em>Out of Reach</em>-- up to this point-- proves Can are trustworthy: they knew what they were     doing holding this back.</p></div>"|1270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1270-out-of-reach/|3.7|Mark Richardson

<i>Understanding Psychedelic Music in the Aftermath of Post-Rock</i><br/>
    August 12th, 2003<br/>
    Test Three</center></p><p>
<b>MULTIPLE CHOICE.</b> Read the following questions and select the best answer from the options listed below.</p><p>
    
    01.	Given the following description of a track from Bardo Pond's recent ATP release <i>On the Ellipse</i>, indicate the song title 
    and emotional hue in which the work metaphorically bathes you.</p><p>
    
    ""Beginning with a melody laid out sparingly by a somber acoustic guitar-- so intimately close you can hear nimble fingers sliding on the greased 
    frets-- the song builds on its base with calculated, yet never forced harmonies, in part courtesy of the ethereal and omnipresent wind.  After an appropriately 
    soothing lull, the droning crash manifests as the rhythm section propels itself into the spotlight, lasting until the song's lumbering end.</p><p>
    
    (a)	""Killing All The Flies"", no...<i>Happy Songs For Happy People</i> + Green.<br/>
    (b)	""Every Man"" + Black.<br/>
    (c)	That song with the paper-thin allegory + Grey.<br/>
    (d)	All of the above.<br/>
    (e)	None of the above.</p><p>
    
    02.	You're at a concert.  A hot Earth Mother-looking woman is playing Sabbath riffs on a flute set against a wavering guitar line.  Drum and bass 
    work together to draw out overarching stomps of pure noise and energy that eventually form a blistering, dense wall.  What is the name of the band you are 
    watching, what song are they playing, and what is the concordant sexual position to accompany intimate listening to said song?</p><p>
    
    (a)	Fleetwood Mac + ""Say You Love Me"" + The Butterfly<br/>
    (b)	Bardo Pond + ""Dom's Lament"" + Missionary<br/>
    (c)	Slint + (the song the group would have made had they contracted a female band-member as advertised in the liner notes of <i>Spiderland</i>) + Gemini<br/>
    (d)	I don't know.  Personally, I only take note of clarinet players, what with their tighter embouchure and greater tongue control.<br/>
    (e)	None of the above.</p><p>
<b>MATCHING.</b>  Match the following artist with their band role.</p><p>
    
    1. Isobelle Sollenberger<br/>
    2. Michael Gibbons<br/>
    3. Clint Takeda<br/>
    4. John Gibbons<br/>
    5. Joe Culver</p><p>
    
    (a) Guitar 1<br/>
    (b) Guitar 2<br/>
    (c) Vocalist/Flautist<br/>
    (d) Drummer<br/>
    (e) Bassist</p><p>
<b>PASSAGE INTERPRETATION.</b>  Answer the following questions based upon analysis of the given excerpt.</p><p>
    
    ""...similar to Janis Joplin fronting Acid Mothers Temple buried underneath a fog of dense instrumentation.  A tumultuous guitar chimes in to wonderful effect, as Isobelle's 
    voice fluctuates from meek humility to forceful gusto, building toward a plump bass line that slides ""Test"" into silent acquiescence.</p><p>
    
    ""JD"" and ""Walking Clouds"" both make use of the dry ambience of their recording atmosphere, the former eventually laying on thick electric reverb in lieu of its 
    introductory acoustic sound, the latter content to muddle on the six-string like a less complex John Fahey.  To this mixture ""Clouds"" also adds a faint human sighing/humming, 
    acting as the constant, lesser companion to a flourishing flute melody, a tune that constantly has to fight for fresh air over the entire second half of the track.</p><p>
    
    The heavy hitter comes last: ""Night Of Frogs"" ends the album on a deservedly high note.  After a guitar- and effects-laden false intro, the song eventually 
    begins with the light plucking and strumming of an acoustic guitar, laying the foundation for a melody that will eventually be eaten alive by song's end.  Atop a full load of 
    odd percussion, Isobelle expounds on the uneasy topic of mortality and the speed with which one's time passes on Earth, slowly leading the listener into the belly of the beast 
    as bongos usher in the inevitable and desirable crash and crescendo of the fully orchestrated band.  The frontal assault is slowly deflated until the song's relatively peaceful 
    end, leaving one nearly as grateful for the conclusion as the experience itself.</p><p>

    (a)	Agree with the reviewer.  Though the fusion of jam band mentality does fortuitously jell with the ebb and flow of post-rock instrumental techniques, at times this 
    mixture can highlight the more undesirable characteristics of both musical genres.<br/>
    (b)	Disagree with the reviewer.  This is stoner-rock at its epitome; the reviewer needs to toke up or get out.<br/>

    <i>Steam Kodok</i> thankfully avoids a major pitfall many ethnic samplers plunge headlong into: all too often, the songs are so similar, it makes for a bloated and 
    tedious compilation.</p><p>
    
    Anyone aroused at the mere mention of 60s beat probably already owns <i>Steam Kodok</i>, but beyond its topical value, this compilation is a remarkable historical 
    document of the effect rock music had on the rest of the world, particularly the East. Up until 1961, the South-East Asian scene was almost entirely instrumental; music was 
    situational: culturally significant, but otherwise insignificant per se. As the Western influence crept in via the increasingly popular Beatles and, says Grey Past, 
    a late 1961 concert by Cliff Richard and The Shadows, South-East Asia eschewed the musical collective and embraced the concept of the ""band""-- steady members, 
    writing songs for their own entertainment.</p><p>
    
    Beyond ""significance,"" though, these songs are utterly enjoyable. South-East Asian musicians were hardly big-budget pop stars, 
    nor did they taut extensive rock pedigrees, and therein lies the charm of <i>Steam Kodok</i>: singers' voices are incongruous but delightfully honest, and the actual 
    compositions-- though necessarily somewhat derivative-- have such a passion that even track 21's note-for-note aping of a Carlos Santana solo is 
    forgiven. The positive energy of each song is just staggering-- <i>Steam Kodok</i> is the sound of a culture thrilled by the prospect of rock-and-roll, overjoyed and unable to 
    stop smiling.</p><p>
    
    ""Ali San"" starts things off appropriately, a lounge-y instrumental with an aching country-western melody traded back and forth between guitar and keyboard, haunted every so often by a bird-like 
    flute trill.  <i>Steam Kodok</i> aims to present a broad survey of the 60s a-go-go scene, and instrumental groups were the first among it; 
    the Eastern flair of the song is immediately apparent, and perfectly encapsulates the worlds-collide motif to which Grey Past most certainly aspires.</p><p>
    
    As the Singapore beat scene progressed, the singer became more than just an afterthought. Lyrically, there was a predicament: Malay and Chinese were national 
    languages, but English was more popular, and its facility with metaphor certainly made it more conducive to rock-and-roll's quasi-poetry. <i>Steam Kodok</i> presents songs 
    from these three very different traditions, each equally rewarding to English-speaking listeners. Regarding the Malay and Chinese lyrics, it is a rare chance to experience 
    vocal melody without the distraction of semiotics (outside of scat singing, of course, whose spontaneity keeps it from achieving the same thoughtfulness of melody). We 
    have no idea what the vocalist is singing in ""Ikan Todak"", for instance, but the very tenor of his voice conveys a level of playfulness so profound, words would have 
    been entirely irrelevant anyway (""Ikan Todak"", incidentally, means ""swordfish"").</p><p>
    
    What stands out most in the English-language cuts is their remarkable simplicity. We tend to think of 60s British and American beat lyrics as utterly quaint 
    and simple-- how much simpler can you get than ""I want to hold your hand"" or ""You got me so I don't know what I'm doing""?-- but emotionally these are pretty 
    complex.  Wanting to hold someone's hand carries metaphorical baggage. A commitment is at hand, so to speak, and paradoxically, a larger physical 
    gesture of love, like a kiss, does not mean nearly as much as a simple hand-hold. When Singapore's the Quests sing, ""You walk with me, you talk with me, and you 
    dance with me,"" ""you'll be my bride,"" and ""I'll be your man,"" they intend no more than just what they say. There is no deeper significance, no implications-- the words 
    are intended prima facie, and the honesty is hugely endearing.</p><p>
    
    As I mentioned earlier, some melodies on <i>Steam Kodok</i> are taken directly from previous English renditions, with only the lyrics replaced or perhaps
    translated to the native language. These minor recontextualizations redeem their outplayed originals: anyone who has spent three seconds in a 
    car with a radio has heard the Temptations' ""Get Ready"", and it's a good song, but many of us have tired of its reincarnations as family vacation sing-alongs. Over time, 
    it seems songs like ""Get Ready"" function more as part of a social fabric than they do as songs themselves-- the thought of coming back from 
    work and listening to some old Temptations records doesn't appeal to me at any rate.  ""Bersedia""-- the Malaysian version of ""Get Ready"" by Ismail Haron 
    &amp; The Guys-- differs from the original only in choice of language, but the variation avails an opportunity to appreciate the song's fantastic melody and snare-on-one 
    backbeat, the elements that made ""Get Ready"" an immediate classic in the first place. <i>Steam Kodok</i> is doubly redemptive, in this sense: on one hand, 
    it rescues otherwise forgotten moments in a rich 60s South-East underground culture; on the other, it makes relevant again our own rich musical history, which we 
    rarely consider on a strictly aesthetic level.</p><p>
    
    Beyond the thought that informed this carefully considered compilation, what fascinates me even more is how powerful of an artform rock-and-roll had become, 
    especially so early in its lifetime. Freedome, fame, fun...it was immediately relevant to so many different cultures. The genre, as <i>Steam Kodok</i>'s 
    very existence would suggest, was instantly politicized, and theretofore has brought together otherwise completely dissimilar cultures, each enchanted by the 
    possibility of creating something that might transcend petty but very real social differences that keep us apart. It speaks to the faculty of art in general, and, 
    given the historical background of <i>Steam Kodok</i>'s contributors, one can only wonder what might have happened in the 1960s had we traded in grenades for guitars 
    and pistols for paintbrushes.</p></div>"|2023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2023-steam-kodok-26-a-go-go-ultrarities-from-the-sixties-singapore-and-south-east-asia-underground/|8.7|Nicholas B. Sylvester

As you may have noticed, these walls, ceilings and floors are very thin: when you drag your chair, play 
    music early in the morning and late at night, you're waking up the neighbors.  Please be considerate and limit these activities as much as possible.  
    Thank you very much.  --Neighbors.""</p><p>
    At one point in time, this courteous yet curt note reminding me of my communal responsibilities would have sent me off the handle, provoking 
    an immature retaliation of Modest Mouse's ""Paper Thin Walls"" followed by Björk's ""Army Of Me"" blared from ceiling to floor at the maximum volume 
    my sleek, wood-grained speakers could muster.  After all, why should I turn down the soothing 6am sound of the Buzzcocks and Pylon when the 
    people below have a baby that screams and hollers at all hours, day and night?  Oh sure, they can ask me to make concessions regarding 
    the passions in my life, but if I were to go downstairs and tell the crying little bundle of joy to shutup, all of the sudden I'm the bad guy.</p><p>
    Suppressing my urge for eviction, I eventually complied, and switched to low volume listening, saving up enough money for  a 
    decent set of headphones.  But the notice came at a bad time, as sitting atop my stack of albums to be reviewed was the most 
    recent Kevin Martin (Techno Animal, The Bug) and Justin Broadrick (Godflesh, Napalm Death) collaboration, under the working guise Curse of the 
    Golden Vampire.  <i>Mass Destruction</i>.  Billed as an electronic melee of hardcore vocals adn hip-hop beats-- with refreshing genre names like 
    ""Death Jungle"" and ""Scum 'n' Bass"" thoughtfully offered for my consideration-- I worried whether I would eventually have to critique the album from the point-of-view 
    of my cramped and acoustically dry car in order to hear it properly.</p><p>
    Fortunately, the Honda-experience wasn't necessary, as the muted apartment revealed a level of <i>Mass Destruction</i> I hadn't originally expected-- a 
    low-key, rhythm-driven album with more to it than meets the ear.  Though it's hidden beneath a layer of deceptively sloppy beats, the record 
    displays a surprising amount of complex and-- for lack of a better description-- pleasant melodies intertwined between the hardcore vocals and fuzzed 
    out bass.</p><p>
    Dismissing off-hand the soon-to-be ebarrassingly dated political stabs-- including the coquettish ""The Myth of Democracy"" and ""United Snakes 
    of America"", the Rogue State-influenced ""Oil Money"", ""State Rape"", and ""Manslaughter""-- the album stands atop a strong base of amalgamated 
    genre-mashing, oft-times providing windows of inquisitive and novel exploration into the respective worlds of hardcore, jungle, and drum 'n' bass.</p><p>
    ""Total Annihilation of Self"" begins the album on an incredibly strong foot, as repeated static notes give way to the hard drums and strong bass stomp of 
    this techno meets hardcore track.  Beneath a harrowing stream of vocal lacerations, the duo expertly control the breakdown of faux-horns and industrial 
    racket, as moments of relative silence creep up occasionally, adding a sense of dynamic mood and tension.  ""Parasite"" follows suit, initially 
    relying on a straightforward guitar intro, but ultimately succumbing to a cyclical backbeat consistently augmented by whining high register noise 
    and mobile electronic tones. </p><p>
    If the latter pair of tracks derive their influence from the heavy hand of metal and hardcore, then ""Iron Ghetto"" is the direct product of the visceral beat and 
    lyrical delivery of Ipecac label-mates and hip-hop revolutionaries Dälek.  Over a dirty beat, the track focuses on the disintegration of structure nearly as much 
    as it does the genesis, leaking break-beats and distorted vocals over the distorted canvas as if the pair of Martin and Broadrick was more concerned with the 
    medium of their message than the context.  ""Murderer"" continues this electronically-born leitmotif of anger and political respite with 
    more ambient industrial noise high in the mix, as the influence of a less reflective SPK is detectable along with the buried musical authority of Alec Empire's 
    former presence.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the multitude of ideas on <i>Mass Destruction</i> don't come to fruition in all regards, as a good portion of the disc slips into homogeneous 
    sounds strongly influenced by the likes of Japanese noise artist Merzbow and/or depressingly obvious, disjointed genre collisions.  While ""Mind Vs Body"", 
    ""End Civilization"", and ""Insecticide"" all make strong use of a wide variety of influences-- from the dance-music of UK ""gare-redge"" 
    to the free-jazz of Brötzmann's Machine Gun-- none of the tracks do so with any type of veiled seam, the stitches in their britches producing a glaring and 
    uncomfortable break in the tracks, akin to watching your grandparents dance the Electric Slide at your cousin's wedding reception.</p><p>
    Even with the benefit of musical interludes segueing the path in between such strongly disparate tracks, the schizophrenic nature of the album ultimately 
    leaves a strong sense of awe and wonder as to why the creators couldn't endow the work with a greater sense of flow and unanimity.  Despite this, 
    <i>Mass Destruction</i> still comes across as a solid addition to the catalogue of both artists, a composition to be enjoyed on many levels, whether as adroit and patient 
    background music or the confrontational, antagonistic screams of political mantra set to the hellish noise of the underground.</p></div>"|1717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1717-mass-destruction/|7.0|Andrew Bryant

    of comparisons are made between this Norwegian hardcore quintet and those ghoulish guys with the corpsepaint and angelic sky-shattering guitar licks. 
    Ask anyone from Seattle, Chapel Hill, or Olympia: regional associations are nearly impossible to shake once the international media pigeonholes you, 
    oversimplifying and repackaging your otherwise multivalent scene. Of course there're more to Norway than black metal, 
    ice and low crime rates, but outside of the internationally recognized Mayhem-and-Burzum-influenced genre, Norway's biggest commercial musical 
    exports are A-Ha and the insipid Kings of Convenience. Neither is very loud, even if the latter want us to believe dull emotional folk passes as 
    having some sort of resonant volume. Other international hitmakers Röyksopp and Secret Garden offer moments of ethereal prettiness that could 
    theoretically bloom-- lopsided-- in late-period Emperor, but that's pushing things a bit. So who's a critic gonna namedrop if not Immortal, et al?</p><p>
    More in the realm of Kaospilot's corpus is JR Ewing, a rattling post-hardcore band who released the excellent, sonically deconstructed 
    <i>Ride Paranoia</i> on GSL a few months ago, but judging from Kaospilot's self-titled debut for Level-Plane, the band would rather consume American 
    screamo's raw-throat yowling, quivering, utopian anarchy-lite lyrical animosity and cathartic slam-dance swizzle-stick breakdowns than take a nod 
    from JR Ewing's inventive re-tooling of classic hardcore. Arming their fists with smashed bottles, Kaospilot sweats Orchid-styled rasp, lacking the 
    seminal pre-Panthers band's ability to construct cogent political sound-bytes while cracking jokes about the Frankfurt School. Like far too 
    many of their less interesting American hardcore counterparts, Kaospilot offer an unfocused agenda, spouting cliches about commodification, sexism, 
    and oppressive governments without offering any possible solutions besides yelling and turning up the amps.</p><p>
    Plowing through tortured scribbles buried in a consistent haze of distorted guitars, most of the eleven tracks are indistinguishable. One of the more 
    interestingly <i>un</i>successful song (""Akathisia"") raises an issue prevalent in black metal: ""What happened to our culture?"" Posing it as a 
    larger, more universal query, the posit loses any specificity that could've otherwise turned it into an interesting diatribe. It jumps through 
    so many cliched Crimethinc hoops, a cogent argument hasn't the space to breath a life of its own without getting restless leg syndrome and running 
    out the door. ""Akathisia"" is the longest piece on the album, plodding for a seemingly interminable 4 whole minutes. When a dreamier moment introduces 
    a break in the onslaught, with whispered female spoken word coupled with sporadic, echoey 
    guitar strumming, the sonic room is appreciable, but unlike their black metal neighbors, when Kaospilot aren't going full-throttle (i.e. loud/soft/louder/soft/loudest/Jawbreaker coda),
    their musical attack is too one-dimensional and unnuanced to keep things interesting. With an approach this thin, it's all-all-all or just about nothing.</p><p>
    To be fair, Kaospilot offers a tight and soaringly adequate battle cry for newly agitated punks who kick it suburban-style at the Warped Tour, but the 
    band's arguments and approach are so overplayed I can't muster a reason to bother listening otherwise. Perhaps if they'd swallowed some of the 
    previously mentioned Norwegian color and incorporated battles-of-the-north bombast and/or multi-note precision into their tedious 
    second-hand approach, Kaospilot wouldn't sound like every boring American hardcore band recycling an already anesthetic past.  It doesn't matter 
    where you're from-- screaming white guys with unkempt hair and black pocket tees don't cut it anymore.</p></div>"|4555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4555-kaospilot/|4.9|Brandon Stosuy

Nothing more, nothing less.  
    From the time when it was fashionable to call bands like Cream and the Hendrix Experience ""power trios"" through the 80s and 90s, when bands like Husker Du and Nirvana 
    would have puked if you'd called them that, this efficient setup has bounced back and forth between the underground and the mainstream, trends permitting.  
    These days, with the internet, file sharing, and instant word of mouth, there's hardly anything like an underground anymore, and just about everything is floating in some main 
    stream or another, but the basic rock trio continues to prove that it's still possible to make a new recipe with the same exact ingredients people have been using for decades.</p><p>
    
    The Natural History seem quite comfortable with their three-piece setup, easing through a lightning-quick batch of snappy American Britpop tunes on their debut album like they've been doing it 
    for years.  The threesome is currently reaping a whirlwind of positive association with the nebulous Yes New York thing, which isn't really a movement, but kind of feels like one 
    anyway.  They had a track on the flagship <i>Yes New York</i> compilation-- ""The Right Hand"", included here-- and they've turned up on Star 
    Time International, one of several tastemaker labels to spring up near the mouth of the Hudson in recent years.</p><p>
    
    Seems as though the table is set for the Natural History, and when folks get their ears on <i>Beat Beat Heartbeat</i>, chances are they'll dig right in.  Really, there's almost nothing <i>not</i> 
    to like here: punchy, semi-distorted guitars, memorable basslines, crisp drumming and vocals that sound a lot like Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys.  Though the vocals are mixed 
    too far down, and the production lacks the necessary pop to complement the band, this doesn't make the music any less invigorating. </p><p>
    
    Guitarist/vocalist Max Tepper can't seem to get Wales and Southern England out of his larynx-- he's just the latest in a long, long line of Americans who just can't help 
    singing in an accent that doesn't belong to them-- but it fits the bouncy songs he's singing so well, it feels almost natural.  Four of these songs aren't even two minutes long, 
    but I have to say I'm glad the album only clocks in a shade under 28 minutes, because the recording makes it too monochromatic to endure for much longer.</p><p>
    
    Tepper's brother Julian anchors his stuttering guitar chords and wiry riffs with tastefully melodic basslines that occasionally make the difference between a boring song and 
    a great one.  ""Run de Run"" is a perfect example, Julian's line ricocheting off of Derek Vockens' strictly rhythmic drums for a feel that's a little bit Philly Soul, a little bit 
    Disco Not Disco.  ""Watch This House"" packs a ton of information into its minute and 43 seconds, with the guitar and bass moving in and out of step with each other while the 
    drums stay utterly focused on the pocket.  Max's falsetto may be the band's secret weapon, as his range helps make the melodies that much more memorable despite being 
    hidden in the mix.</p><p>
    
    ""Do What You Should"" and ""Hours of My Life"" are the best back-to-back illustration of the Natural History's range, the former droning on a nervous guitar and bubbling, tense 
    bass line, while the latter swings full on into a swaggering guitar riff and blaring choruses packed with mad strumming and big drums fills.  It's that range that will make the 
    Natural History a great band in the future if they learn to explore it (and make a recording that's more sympathetic to it).  <i>Beat Beat Heartbeat</i> is a fun, guileless debut from a 
    band with obvious reference points that nonetheless sounds pretty distinct.  Something tells me their next move will amaze us.</p></div>"|5877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5877-beat-beat-heartbeat/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    transformed into a secret weapon of sorts for contemporary bands trying their pitch-pipe best to channel some kind of Brian Wilson, 
    surf-rock thing.  Either way, it's an ambitious, if inherently plucky proposition; outside of elementary schools and churches, 
    misused four-part harmony can be deeply embarrassing in a gruesome, tingly way, all awkward, straining notes and graceless 
    synchronization, missed beats and screechy climaxes.</p><p>
    
    Given the context, it's possible that the Joggers have just four-handedly manned a vocal revolution.  On <i>Solid Guild</i>, the former 
    members of Stateside see their round, puppy-dog warbles coalescing into quirky, unexpected four-part harmonies inspired, supposedly, 
    by the shape-note (or sacred harp) traditions of the late eighteenth-century, an inclusive vocal system devised to make group 
    hymn singing possible for folks who couldn't otherwise read music (written notes are assigned one of four different shapes; 
    participating singers arrange themselves in a circle or square, facing inward, and perform a capella.)  For <i>Solid Guild</i>, the four 
    Joggers airlift the shape-note process from the deep and dirty American south, setting it down on the comparably tidy streets of 
    Portland, Oregon, and transplanting their resulting harmonies into perfectly contemporary punk rock songs.</p><p>
    
    The idea of deliberately co-opting a semi-obscure, southern hymn-howling convention might seem unbearably pretentious on paper, but 
    it's an entirely different monster in practice-- dynamic and heavily textured, there's a bare-boned, unfiltered honesty to the 
    Joggers' yelps that should dissuade ill-willed naysayers and gospel purists. Truthful and energized, the Joggers' anachronistic 
    harmonies offer an airy counterpoint to their prickly, arrow-slinging guitars and sharp, every-man-for-himself riffing-- rather 
    than bogging these songs down, they somehow open them up.</p><p>
    
    ""Back To The Future"" leads with mischievous guitar interplay, axmen Murphy Kasiewicz and Ben Whitesides antagonizing each other via an 
    echo-and-build exchange before drums curl in and all four voices pipe up enthusiastically, pointing in different directions-- 
    eventually, they lose the instruments all together, their broad, scrappy wails going unaccompanied, lyrics unintelligible, trills 
    popping up and down, attacking from all angles.  It's an engaging moment, and the Joggers periodically employ this type of 
    clearinghouse trick, pushing their punchy instrumentation aside in favor of sharp vocal breakdowns. ""Neon Undercarriage,"" an otherwise 
    Strokes-ish garage romp, sees its perky guitar hook interrupted by a stand-alone slap of harmony, this one abstract and convoluted 
    enough to function, successfully, as its own kind of four-man instrument.</p><p>
    
    Keep in mind that vocals aren't the only shots being fired: most of <i>Solid Guild</i> plays like a big, well-choreographed skirmish, with 
    Kasiewicz's and Whitesides' guitars darting and tumbling, wrestling and pinning each other down, Jake Morris' punchy drums piping up, 
    slotting in raucous fills where you'd least expect them, and Darrell Bourque's persistent bass stringing all the disparate parts 
    back together, sort of.  It's a huge, exhilarated mess, a clash of sounds, starts, and stops that's nearly impossible to chart; 
    traditional notions of synchronicity aren't relevant, and nobody's doing the same thing at the same time.  They might be necessarily 
    complex, but the Joggers' compositions aren't sloppy, impenetrable, or gratuitously harried-- it's just rich, purposefully disjointed 
    fun, entirely cringe-less and consistently surprising.  All without the matching vests.</p></div>"|4335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4335-solid-guild/|8.0|Amanda Petrusich

    drably dressed doppelgangers, and  people in red without torsos; across the tan expanse, two inscrutable nurses and a guy in a bear suit observe this 
    nap time-cum-mass suicide. Since the mid 90s, this punk-rock Joseph Cornell's tiny drawings of dancing trees, angry deer, fatuous alligators, 
    bloody frogs, worrisome amputees, violent elves, and other damaged, often armed characters have accumulated like snow, forming an 
    obsessive cosmology built upon dusty bookstore ephemera. Unfortunately, The Weakerthans' by-the-books music isn't nearly as captivating.</p><p>
    
    Known mostly as a gentler post-Propagandhi project, The Weakerthans are fronted by John K. Samson, who during his five years with the left-wing 
    jokesters contributed the bratty pop filler to the band's enjoyably cartoonish agenda. If you were to expand those bits about preteen 
    McCarthyism and Southern Manitoba into an entire pop album, make 'em a bit alt-country, and add a a few more literary references-- say, an icy dinner
    with a Derrida-toting Michel Foucault, and a song named after a Martin Amis novel in which time plays out backwards-- you'd have a good idea 
    what <i>Reconstruction Site</i> is all about.</p><p>
    
    Though their critical framework is stuck in the 80s (come on, Scritti Politti did ""Jacques Derrida"" in '82!) the intellectual smarminess is good 
    for a shiny poetic moment here and there. ""(Manifest)"" sports one of my favorite album-opening lines in recent memory; though the song 
    itself implodes along the fault lines of its own cleverness, the distance and intimacy is admirable: ""I want to call requests through 
    heating-vents/ And hear them answered with a whisper, 'No.'""  Aside from a couple other fine one-liners and the soaring trumpet by guest player Rusty 
    Matys, the song's pretty tired. The chords and vocal line show up twice more, with slight variations, as ""(Hospital Vespers)"" 
    and ""(Past-Due)"", the latter  drenched in John Berger's <i>Ways Of Seeing</i>: ""February always finds you folding local papers open to the faces 'passed 
    away'/ To wonder what they're holding in those hands we're never shown/ The places formal photographs refuse to mention."" The venerable Greek Chorus, notions of 
    difference/repetition, and communication theory are noted, but if one track is unremarkable the first time around, it just grows irksome 
    thrice! Word?</p><p>
    
    And there are lower points than that triad: the title track sounds like Smash Mouth, ""Time's Arrow""-- the Amis song-- is 
    reminiscent of lightweight All About Chad or some other adolescent twee crud from the mid 90s, and the last third of the album sounds like absolutely 
    nothing at all (which is remarkable in and of itself).</p><p>
    
    On the plus side, Samson pens lyrics from the point-of-view of a cynical cat-- ""Plea From A Cat Named Virtue""-- and both ""The Reasons"" and the 
    French-inflected ""Our Retired Explorer (Dines With Michel Foucault In Paris, 1961)"" would make finely catchy radio singles for fans of faux-Weezer geek 
    rock. It's also fun discovering well-wrought nuggets amid the dross: lines like ""tune the FM in to static, and pretend that it's the sea""-- from the 
    James-Agree referential ""The Prescience of Dawn""-- are fine flourishes for aesthetes and pop romantics alike.</p><p>
    
    Throughout it's fourteen tracks, there's no doubting The Weakerthans are smart guys who keep up with literature and politics, but over the course of 
    an entire album the band's ambitious literary posturing drowns in the bland songwriting and lack of captivating hooks. Perhaps best consumed as a 
    single between Built to Spill and Dismemberment Plan on some smarmy Ivy League college radio show, The Weakerthans need less talk and a lot more pop 
    in their formula.  With their soundtrack, I'd much rather read the book.</p></div>"|8593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8593-reconstruction-site/|5.6|Brandon Stosuy

    lots of different things pretty well. Beck's heir apparent in the eclecticism-masking-as-bursting-with-creative-energy lineage was Badly Drawn Boy, but the charm that burst from the 
    stocking-capped one's early EPs-- and occasionally raised its head on <i>The Hour of the Bewliderbeast</i>-- quickly settled into a stench of MOR tunes framed by tired honest, busker 
    ethics. Other FM dial-skimmers are worse: The Dandy Warhols are practically a bar cover band; Ryan Adams has even gone so far as to appropriate all of the obnoxious trappings of how a 
    Rock Star is supposed to act; the Vines sound like a condensation of the contents of a typical issue of <i>Q</i> magazine. Are these guys any more interesting than specific necrophiliacs 
    like the Thrills or Kings of Leon or Black Rebel Motorcycle Club? Not really, but their failing to be succeed in multiple different ways creates the illusion that they're actually offering something 
    interesting.</p><p>
    
    More to the point: are Australia's the Sleepy Jackson any different? Well, almost. With a capacity to write winning choruses and graceful sinewy guitar lines, the Sleepy Jackson's Luke Steele 
    is a more than capable tunesmith, but one too often pleased with compounding his rustic pop core with restless, offputting eccentricity (including lamentable stabs at the offbeat 
    such as a single child-like voice over plink-plonk piano on ""Morning Bird"" and the gothic spoken-word bore ""Fill Me With Apples"").</p><p>
    
    I'm not the least bit surprised this is getting good reviews from the British press. For the past, say, five years or so, the <i>NME</i> and the monthlies seem to make time for anything that fits 
    the romantic notion of America as an expansive sometimes untamed land, any record that embodies California's slow sun-kissed pace, the grandiosity of Big Sky country and its endless 
    horizon, or the twang of the open trail. In the hands of Mercury Rev, Lambchop, or the Flaming Lips that's frequently been a good thing, but many of their contemporaries (Grandaddy, the 
    Polyphonic Spree, Giant Sand, Beachwood Sparks, most of the Americana bands that get fellated in Uncut) don't do much to inspire. These are the sorts of styles between which Sleepy Jackson's Luke Steele
    flits, but the more stereotypically American he seems, the worse the result. Outsiders borrowing elements of a specific sound can result in some charming mis-readings or clever 
    interpretations/spins on classic formulas, but where the Sleepy Jackson try to swing open the saloon doors they merely end up walking on steakhouse-floor peanut shells. </p><p>
    
    It's a shame, because the brooding ""Don't You Know""-- with a ""Rock On""-style electro-gurgle stalking the tune's perimeter while a generally restrained choral voice and 
    string lines fills its baroque center-- demonstrates a tasteful balance between what Steele does best: Deceptively direct tunes delicately layered with ornate production and instrumentation.  
    The best results of that formula are a pair of leftovers from a series of EPs the band recorded over the past couple of years, ""Good Dancers""-- a deadringer for John Lennon's ""#9 Dream""--  
    and ""This Day"", which is proof that Steele is as familiar with fellow Aussie Grant McLennan (the Go-Betweens) he is with George Harrison (who is surely the record's patron saint). </p><p>
    
    In other spots the results are a bit more mixed, but there are still a handful of things worth savoring; new single ""Vampire Racecourse"" is a decent faux-glam stomper, and ""Rain Falls For Wind"" 
    is a great summer night track, but it's one you won't remember in the morning. The jangly ""Come to This"" is only a reminder that Tom Petty actually wrote a decent tune or two before becoming a fulltime 
    curmudgeon spouting insightful ""rap is crap""-style witticisms on VH1 and in <i>Rolling Stone</i>. </p><p>
    
    If his eccentricity was tamed and the pained attempts to hop genres were avoided, Luke Steele could just produce something close to sublime. As it stands, <i>Lovers</i> is a fairly pleasant 
    application of some charming reference points, but please, let's stop pretending that that's good enough.</p></div>"|7698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7698-lovers/|6.0|Scott Plagenhoef

    last I heard, James was busy scaring the shit out of solicitors at his South Carolina home.  With that in mind, it's good to know his legacy and legend 
    are in safe keeping via his music, and the myriad compilations detailing the facets of his genius.  <i>In the Jungle Groove</i> was originally 
    issued in 1986, just as interest in Brown's backbeats reawakened via the power of sampling in hip-hop, and cut for cut, it's in the highest category of 
    Brown compilations, standing tall alongside any of his greatest hits sets (and even the <i>Star Time</i> box). It's not that it necessarily covers a lot of 
    ground, or even gives a good overall view of Brown's career-- because it really only spans a short period from late 1969 until mid 1971, with a bonus 
    track from 1972 added for this reissue-- but those years were particularly fertile, and this set nails them.</p><p>
    
    The early 70s is generally viewed as Brown's last really great period, but it's not without problems.  For starters, his band underwent two 
    complete overhauls: after working with the same basic core since about 1964 (with minor fluctuations as during Maceo and Melvin Parker's military 
    stints), mutiny reared its ugly head in the spring of 1970.  With trombonist Fred Wesley checking out to L.A., Maceo took his ball and the rest of the 
    band and went on the road his own damn self.  Without anyone to back him, Brown was in dire straights-- that is until right hand man Bobby Byrd 
    called long-distance to the Cincinnati residence of William (""Bootsy"") and Phelps Collins.  Along with longtime associate Sir Clyde Stubblefield, the 
    new groove was formed, and dubbed the JB's.  That is, until Bootsy started having horrific acid experiences onstage, and fell out with Brown in the 
    process.  When Wesley returned, and regulars like St. Clair Pinckney and John ""Jabo"" Starks climbed back onboard, the JB's were officially retooled 
    and managed to stick it out until the mid-70s.  Hardest working men in show business, indeed.</p><p>
<i>In the Jungle Groove</i> runs through all of that via ten pretty amazing tracks that manage to sound like one huge break despite the clamor behind the 
    scenes.  ""It's A New Day"" leads things off on a particularly upbeat note, even for these guys.  Brown makes his case for letting ""the girls know what 
    they can do for us"" before Jimmy Nolen drops a very funky Stax-esque guitar lick and the horns hit their thing.  When the drums come in and the 
    handclaps slap, I do believe the portion of cosmos located right above my house is aligned.  We're one song in, and the fucking cosmos is aligned.  
    ""Can I get a witness?""  By all means, and then serve up ""Funky Drummer"".  Of all the songs here, ""Funky Drummer"" is easily the most heard, even if only 
    for Stubblefield's still-unholy-after-all-these-years break.  What's not so known is the understated, but cutting solo by Maceo and Brown's own wildly 
    unhinged organ touches.</p><p>
    
    The Bootsy years are represented by a very hot remix of ""Give It Up or Turn It Loose"", ""I Got to Move"", ""Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing"", ""Get Up, Get 
    Into It and Get Involved"" and ""Soul Power"".  ""Give It Up"" in particular stands out, thanks to the whiplash sound of Stubblefield's drums and 
    Bootsy's restless, but tight bass lines.  There's a break in the middle where the band drops out and only Brown's orders to ""clap your hands, stomp 
    your feet"" and Johnny Griggs' congas are keeping the beat alive.  When Brown gives the signal (""Clyde!""), and the drums re-enter, dollars to donuts 
    you're out the window with funky joy (or calling for the Neptunes' heads for their complete rip of this trick-- ""drums!""-- for Justin Timberlake, of all 
    people).  ""Talkin' Loud"" also gets a new shine via the remix treatment, as the golden tag team of Stubblefield, Collins and Nolen get their rocks off 
    and then some.  James Brown isn't really the kind of artist who needs his stuff beefed up, but here it only serves to make a very good thing harder 
    and hotter.</p><p>
    
    The final track is the previously unreleased, extended version of ""Blind Man Can See It"", originally a part of Brown's soundtrack to the blaxploitation 
    flick <i>Black Caesar</i>.  Jabo Starks keeps everything very much in the pocket here, as Brown is content to run amok off-mic around the studio.  The 
    mostly-instrumental jam keeps fairly calm (and the Rhodes asides are key), and if not for Nolen's rampantly sampled guitar line and Brown's ending 
    soliloquy lamenting the lack of gigs around, this could probably pass for straight ahead acid-jazz funkateering.  It's perhaps not in the same 
    stratospheric pantheon as other cuts on the set, but like pretty much everything Brown did during this time, it gets the job done easily.</p><p>
    
    There are a few very good compilations available covering Brown's pure funk period: besides this one, be sure to check out the <i>James Brown's Funky 
    People</i> series, <i>Funk Power 1970</i>, <i>Make It Funky: The Big Payback</i> and the two-disc JB's anthology.  All of them are incredible, and emphasize slightly 
    different aspects of his (and his band's) music from the late 60s and early 70s.  However, times are tight, and if you only have room for one on your 
    shelf, you couldn't do much better than this CD.  Cliff White had it right 17 years ago, and he has it right now: this ain't for the faint hearted.  
    This is the jungle groove.</p></div>"|974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/974-in-the-jungle-groove/|8.6|Dominique Leone

    store, complete with a repeatedly revised list of ""pivotal"" influences and some superfluous exclamation points at the bottom? 
    Turns out there are new, fancy ways to get a group together: garage-blues duo the Kills are the unlikely result of a heated cross-
    Atlantic cassette correspondence between British instrumentalist Hotel and American vocalist VV, and all the head-scratching quirks 
    of their bizarre formative circumstances (Hotel? VV? Florida to London?) are perfectly communicated in the quasi-desperate nuance 
    of their smarmy guitar-and-drums tunes.  The <i>Fried My Little Brains</i> EP-- a three-song companion piece to the Kills' full-length debut 
    <i>Keep On Your Mean Side</i>-- is as reckless and unexpected as the Kills themselves, with all the lonely, awkward distance of a tape-by-
    tape, multi-national, air-mail band rehearsal.  VV might have eventually relocated to London to facilitate their songwriting 
    process, but the cold, sleeping-alone separation of their start still lingers here.</p><p>
    
    Clocking in at a twitch over two minutes and featuring a single sinister, foot-pounding blues riff, ""Fried My Little Brains"" can be 
    a semi-befuddling single/EP choice, considering that <i>Keep On Your Mean Side</i> also houses some significantly more dynamic (and longer) 
    cuts-- but it's still a reeling, addictively cocky stomp, with full boy-girl harmonies and steady, minimalist percussion.  VV and 
    Hotel's repetitive hollers (""Won't move over/ Won't get gone/ Won't move over/ Fried my little brains"") play like disinterested whines, 
    childish despite their illicit connotations-- their half-hearted yelps capture, expertly, the bored, numbing part of being young and 
    druggy.</p><p>
    
    B-side ""Jewel Thief"" hollers back to the spirit of the band's <i>Black Rooster</i> EP, with its churning, lo-fi blurriness, frenzied acoustic 
    strumming, and typewriter-tap drumming. Less blatantly Delta-loving, ""Jewel Thief"" is a welcome counterpoint to the determinably 
    garage-based blues noodlerisms that make <i>Keep On</i> occasionally sag; sexy and playful, ""Jewel Thief"" is mischievous and surprisingly 
    light.  Closer ""Sugar Baby"" is a shifty, fuzz-heavy Dock Boggs cover-- although Boggs' Kentucky-coal-miner-gone-Lonesome-Ace-barn-
    dancer twang is conspicuously absent, as is his beloved banjo strum-- thick with the kind of contemporary ambivalence that would, 
    presumably, effectively exclude it from any future <i>American Folk Music</i> anthologies.  </p><p>
    
    Overall, something about VV's disembodied howl can be unnervingly empty, and her perpetually blank-faced detachment is what keeps the 
    Kills' sound distinctly theirs, despite a bunch of otherwise apt comparisons to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O.  Appropriate or not, 
    it's still an interesting parallel: as a vocalist, O. is an intensely palpable performer, a raw, busted-up, writhing mess that, 
    for all her predetermined posturing, feels extraordinarily actual to an audience.</p><p>
    
    No matter how far back you're crouching at a Yeah Yeah Yeahs show, you're gonna get hit with the thick, sour smell of intentionally dribbled beer, 
    feel O.'s half-drunk kicks and punches, hear her frantic gasps for air-- inevitably, fans are assailed, sometimes mercilessly, by all the peripheral quirks of a 
    woman who's occupying her voice. With the Kills, what kills is how remote and distracted VV sounds, and how tense her absence is in 
    the context of Hotel's fiery guitar slamming. But the conflict works-- the pair make oddly compelling partners, and <i>Fried My 
    Little Brains</i> is, at less than ten minutes long, a nicely jarring burst. </p></div>"|4425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4425-fried-my-little-brains-ep/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

    ""Cameltoe"". It's half-smash, half-novelty; its tight cartoon booty-beat leaps out of car speakers like a G-rated ""Me So Horny"", but its radio play has more to do with the two 
    teenage girls dropping lines like ""Is your crotch hungry, girl?/ Cause it's eating your pants.""</p><p>
    
    But we are not going to talk about ""Cameltoe"", which turns out to be one of the less interesting tracks on the full-length <i>So Stylistic</i> (most interesting: ""Hey Mami"", which 
    we'll get to in a second). Instead, we will review the story-so-far of Fannypack, and then I will explain why I might be mining this little collection for mix-tape fodder pretty heavily over the 
    coming weeks.</p><p>
    
    The Fannypack concept comes from a couple of DJs-- Matt Goias and ""Fancy""-- who got frustrated with the big beats-per-minute gulf between danceable house and slow-loping 
    hip-hop hits, which please crowds but aren't as good for working up a sweat. Their go-getting solution to this problem is an intuitive mash-up of a few things: rumpshaker 
    club hip-hop of the booty-bouncing, system-rattling kind (it doesn't get made much anymore); the clean-lined robotic twitching of old-school electro breakdance tracks, and 
    the straighter rush and careful production of house and techno. All of which makes it sound a million times more complicated than it really is, but the fact that this stuff can be 
    so straightforward and yet naggingly unique is its biggest gift: critics have hemmed and hawed about it and mostly just agreed that it reminds them of L'Trimm's memorable 
    one-hit ""Cars with the Boom"".</p><p>
    
    Which brings us up to the next part. L'Trimm's Bunny and Tigra were two very young girls in snappy outfits who didn't rhyme so much as talk and preen and be awesome; 
    Goias and Fancy, after enlisting red-headed indie-chick Cat for the tracks they were working up, hit on something similar. Goias claims he just happened to hear 18-year-old 
    Jessibel Suthiwong screaming across a Brooklyn street one day and figured she was exactly what they needed; she and her even younger friend Belinda are here for lifesize 
    bratty cool much more than award-winning mic-handling. Soon enough, they were decked out in fab accessories-- Belinda's shoes versus Cat's scarf!-- and posing for the cover 
    of this record. For the electro girl-group <i>W.I.T.</i>, producer Larry Tee found three micro-dressed prettygirls to pose, giggle, and flirt; Fannypack has the same New York 
    fashion-plate fun-time vibe, only these kids are far more earnest than they are camp.</p><p>
    
    And no, of course it's not a good record by the high-modernist rock-boy standards of seriousness and emotional outpouring and whatnot. But neither, ""Cameltoe"" notwithstanding, 
    is it just a bit of brainless fun. Between Goias and Fancy's remarkable drop-rolling bass science and the girls' bratty-Brooklynite rhyming, the better singles on here wind up 
    sounding like something unprecedented: a booty-bass record for small children. There's just no other way to describe it: the guys' clever boings and beeps tend to be as cute as 
    they are ass-twitching, making the whole thing feel like the would-be soundtrack for a Saturday-morning Salt 'n' Pepa cartoon.</p><p>
    
    So between sampling both the Legendary Cold Crush Brothers and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and between a bunch of talky tracks in which Jessibel makes fun of Fancy's shirt and 
    Cat gets called a hippopotamus-ass, here are the bits I'd be leaving on mix-tapes left and right if I weren't too lazy to make them:</p><p>
    
    ""Hey Mami"". The obligatory buzz-off to scrubby guys turns out to be the best track on the record. It's the best beat, some deconstructed Latin piano tinkling over a super-jumpy beat 
    and some of that pervasive big, boingy bass rolling; it's also the best microphone tag-team, the moment where you suddenly suspect the girls' rhyming really is meant to be a focus. 
    When a big crisp break and a load of scratching come in at the end, the Pavlovian response is to start it all over again, just for this: ""Hootin and hollerin/ Ring around the collar and/ 
    This ain't Scores, and you ain't waving a dollar.""</p><p>
    
    ""So Stylistic"". The big old-school breaking track, like if Grandmaster Flash got early access to mid-90s sub-bass; the slinky darkness of the ""Push It""-style electro lead and the 
    vocordered chorus hook are a perfect backdrop for this Friday-night glamour-girl proclamation. Belinda's nails are done. So is her homework.</p><p>
    
    ""Boom Boom"" and ""Do It To It"". Like the names indicate: here's where you get the stiff tickle and the robotic ""make that booty jerk"" commands. The former has the 
    album's queasiest bass drops and most insistent chopped-up dance instructions-- ""Booty up, booty down/ Work that booty all around"", yet it's somehow totally kid-friendly. 
    The latter pairs some actual singing with Cat trying out the electro monotone voice Miss Kittin usually gets calls for.</p><p>
    
    ""Things"". Not because it's really good, though it's a nice mid-album diversion: just thought you might want to know that this is the one where they sample the Yeah Yeah Yeah's 
    ""Art Star"". For the purpose of an 8-year-old's singalong about their likes and dislikes: yes to parties, candy, shopping and boys, no to school and bad weather. Between this 
    and the preceding discussion of bunnies, the ""cute"" reaches a mildly discomforting peak.</p><p>
    
    Not exactly a great victory in the album-oriented terms of solidity or consistency, though the other tracks aren't nearly ""bad."" On the other hand, thank God for that: <i>So Stylistic</i> holds at 
    least two of the most interesting tracks I've heard this year, and Fannypack have built a decent enough album around them.</p></div>"|3259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3259-so-stylistic/|7.7|Nitsuh Abebe

In my own experience anyway, love-- even relatively simple love-- always complicates 
    things.  Easy living really requires a lack of commitments, not to mention a lack of consequences for taking it easy all the time (i.e. no asking why the garbage didn't go out or why the phone 
    remained silent even as the clock ticked past 1:00 am).  Being in love isn't bad, of course, it's just not easy.  But then again, I guess <i>Love or Easy Living</i> doesn't quite have the same 
    ring to it.</p><p>
    
    Central Falls turn the <i>Easy Living</i> half of the title into an outright Gershwin reference just as the record kicks off.  The clean, wispy guitars take a quick pass at the opening progression 
    and melody to old George's classic ""Summertime"" before wandering off into the haze where they spend the rest of the album.  The song is even called ""Springtime""-- get it?  Of course 
    you do, but don't expect any more music dork humor ahead, because the Chicago boys in Central Falls play it pretty straight from there on out-- <i>Love and Easy Living</i>'s overarching vibe 
    is one of a sad, sultry summer, and its tone keeps making me slip and call it <i>Love and Easy </i>Listening.</p><p>
    
    The two major players in this whole Central Falls conspiracy are brothers Ben and Adam Vida, who all good scenesters know from their respective other bands, Town &amp; Country and U.S. 
    Maple.  A word of caution: don't go looking for any traces of U.S. Maple in Central Falls, because there aren't any-- Adam Vida spends his time behind the kit in U.S. Maple banging out 
    anti-rhythms while his mates explode and melt around him, offering answers to the question ""what happens when rock collapses?""  Here, he hands the sticks over to Jason Adasiewicz, 
    a skilled skinsman who's made the rounds in the Windy City post-rock scene, and who sticks rather politely to steadfast, simple rhythm and the occasional Nick Mason fill.</p><p>
    
    Adasiewicz is mixed too low on ""Springtime""-- so low, in fact, that you can't hear him until you turn it up quite loud, which is a problem, because the meditative guitar parts need his 
    guiding push in order to sound like anything other than soup.  When you boost the volume though, the song's lilt and bounce work pretty nicely-- the larynx of a Vida is typically given 
    to a smooth tenor croon that blends nicely with a crisp electric guitar and a Hammond-- and the brothers harmonize well, though they don't exactly bring to mind anyone named Wilson.</p><p>  
    
    As is frequently the case with albums that have more to offer in texture than melody, though, things bleed together like watercolors, and longer songs like ""The Fights Are Staged"" are 
    inevitably marooned in the ""Is this still the same song?"" maze that so many albums get lost in.  Still, ""Weekenders"" rises above with a fine horn arrangement and a rather affecting 
    refrain of ""Weekenders, you fuck off/ I am here forever,"" which could be an anthemic sentiment for any number of folks, from resort town natives to kids manning registers on a Saturday 
    evening.</p><p>
    
    If nothing else, Central Falls have improved appreciably on their even more diffuse debut, and crafted a fine album for folks whose seasonal affective disorders kick in halfway through 
    July (perhaps Red Sox and Cubs fans?).  There's more dynamic tension here, exemplified in the shifting rhythms and jazzbo guitar of ""Covered Below"" and the toothy horn part to ""Morning 
    Sky"".  Really, tighter melodies are all Central Falls need to put a record in your face, instead of on the periphery, but as wallpaper goes, <i>Love and Easy Living</i> is good stuff, well 
    mounted.

    going to refrain from using for the remainder of this write-up.  Just as rock of the independent variety had fans, writers, and PR employees shoving twee-ness like East River 
    Pipe into the same overfilled nook with rabid madmen like 
    the Jesus Lizard, so would the E word attempt to cover more musical ground than one might consider reasonable.  A quick check of fourfa.com (a noble attempt to make sense of 
    this madness) would have visitors believe that just about anything from Rites Of Spring to Cap'n Jazz to even The Strokes qualifies as-- OK, I'll say it-- emo.  That's a lot of area to 
    lay claim to, and it does little more than turn that E word into a mutt-like descriptor-- the term refers to so many things, it ends up referring to nothing.  That doesn't do a group like the 
    Jealous Sound any favors.</p><p>
    In its current configuration, The Jealous Sound features former members of Knapsack, Sunday's Best, Jawbox and Shudder to Think (those last 2 groups are part of 
    the litany thanks to drummer Adam Wade, but Wade didn't even drum on this record).  In this instance, the key precedent to take note of is Knapsack-- that's the voice of former 
    backpacker Blair Shehan singing lines like ""There was a guy/ Making a plan/ Find a girl/ And she'd understand.""  Yeah, yeah, you <i>think</i> you know the drill-- MORE 
    silly love songs?-- but then Shehan offers less obvious lines like, ""Did you manage to forget / Did you tie the tourniquet?/ Forgive me for gushing."" This is a cloyingly 
    clever sample, but Shehan's decision to err on this side rather than on the clichéd and plainspoken ""he said moon/ she said June\x94 side does the record a world of good.</p><p>
    Where these words might once have found themselves attached to a voice prone to tortured yelping and pre-pubescent cracking, they're now delivered by a raspy croak not too 
    dissimilar from something off a Replacements record.  Haters might want to point to the Goo Goo Dolls instead-- it's all about the indie cred with some folks-- but both 
    comparisons would be equally appropriate.  There's enough of a down-to-earth rock vibe on this record to keep the more mawkish moments from becoming overbearing.  
    Besides, if you're already fond of the Superchunky basslines and synth blubbery on <i>Kill Them With Kindness</i>, it's doubtful that a little thing like who the singer sounds like will keep you from 
    enjoying it.</p><p>
    And this actually <i>is</i> an enjoyable record-- a solid set of rock songs that hovers somewhere between the professionalism of Jimmy Eat World's <i>Bleed American</i> and your 
    favorite slice of homegrown emotion.  This assumes, of course, that you have an affinity for this stuff.  If the thought of a band performing this heartfelt guitar-centric safety dance 
    for a bunch of Doc Marteneers makes you want to shave your head and talk to yourself in mirrors, then please leave the Jealous Sound be and let me introduce you to a group of 
    earnest young men calling themselves Dashboard Confessional.</p></div>"|4334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4334-kill-them-with-kindness/|6.8|David Raposa

A patron of music and patron 
    saint to so many of its players, there was a crossroads left in his wake. Electric instrumentation was slowly seeping in from one side, and with it, its rockist and 
    studio-manipulated pleasures.  Miles Davis employed electric keyboards, punched in solos and seamlessly edited tracks in this era, and is an obvious example, 
    as are folks like Eddie Harris and Charles Lloyd, who were similarly amplifying and opening for rock groups at the Fillmore West. The other route was to take the music even further 
    out into the cosmos, as Albert Ayler did with his inner-being blues holler or the Art Ensemble of Chicago, with their Pan-African extrapolations into the primal unknown. Few attempts 
    were made fto find a middle ground though, that could mingle jazz with rock, or free-playing in a more palatable pop manner without falling victim to the later Fusion craze.  Or 
    at least so I thought, until coming across this Byard Lancaster reissue of his debut recording as band leader.</p><p>
    
    What strikes me first is the overall melodic sensibility of each of the players. Lancaster, on alto sax and flute, would go on to play with outsider luminaries like Sun Ra, Bill Dixon, 
    and Fred Hopkins. Sharrock's violently strummed strings on Black Woman and Monkey Pockie-Boo led to the vortices of Sonic Youth, Fugazi, and pretty much all future physical guitarists. Eric 
    Gravatt would soon join an early version of Weather Report, yet everyone defers their skronkier, unrestrained abilities to the overall structure of each tune. This gives the Anglo folk base 
    of some of Lancaster's compositions plenty room to be heard and hummed. Even moodier pieces like ""Last Summer"" move smoothly as panther haunches, Sharrock's playing clean 
    and lissome over the slowly bowed, bassy sinews of Jerome Hunter as the band tenses and glides about the flute line.</p><p>
    
    ""John's Children""-- an overt reference to their own state as post-Coltrane players-- has the undulating modal walk of a Jimmy Garrison bassline, incessantly prying open the infinite portal 
    as Byard cries down into the void. The horn's palpable ""space"" is coated by producer Joel Dorn with enough reverb as to make his alto sound as if its emitted from the recesses of a cave, 
    the guitar, congas, and cymbals a dizzying whirlwind of bats about him. Lancaster trills along with Sonny's humming bumblebee blurs and stinging single-string tones in 
    their homage to Ayler, ""Mr. A.A."" The chord progressions are the most rock-sounding I've cmoe across from this era of jazz, and the pan-pipe flits that the flute elicits echo not only 
    Henry ""Ragtime"" Thomas but the contemporary Canned Heat update ""Goin' Up Country"". </p><p>
    
    The flute that tweets over the stomp of ""Dogtown"" recollects those weird Herbie Mann records that had Sharrock on them and its conga-clapped coda is a real sign of the studio's 
    presence, as the tape speeds the hits into a blur, dropping us into the stunning rendition of ""Over the Rainbow"". Lancaster's take would be noteworthy enough, but it's the way certain 
    notes are bandied about, held in space by Dorn over the deep bass gurgle, that creates dozens of little whirls within the song, the melody expanded but the fabric never shredded. 
    After such a poignant solo turn, it seems the nine-minute closer has him there in presence only, and it's just the guitar-bass-drum trio that fully imbibes this dynamic, heavily 
    breathing dark music, heaving like tides in the deepest night. Not surprisingly, it's entitled ""Satan"", an unsettling way to end this singular jazz session. </p></div>"|4944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4944-its-not-up-to-us/|8.0|Andy Beta

I see that double entendre in your new album title.  Anyone with a passing familiarity with your work could guess it's just another morbidly humorous 
    jab at yourself, like the title of your last full-length of new material, <i>The Invisible Man</i>.  Ah, but further research reveals the true back story here-- <i>The Ugly American</i> was recorded 
    in Greece, with a band of local musicians playing mostly traditional instruments.  You're still poking fun at yourself, but this time it's more specifically aimed at your temporary 
    expatriation.  Mark, I don't wanna accuse you of being in a holding pattern or anything, because I hear you're writing stuff for a new album, but two albums with no new 
    original material in two years is mighty suspicious.  I'm just saying.</p><p>
    
    Last year's <i>Music for Courage &amp; Confidence</i> was a diverting foray into the oft dodgy realm of covers by our man Eitzel, but it wasn't terribly essential listening, largely because it 
    found him putting aside his primary strength-- songwriting-- in favor of a spin through a weirdly chosen repertoire of other people's songs.  I guess you could see it as something 
    of a vacation for him, and <i>The Ugly American</i>, following almost exactly a year later, feels like an extension of that vacation, revisiting nine songs from his past (both solo and with 
    the venerable American Music Club), and recasting them through the lens of Greek folk music.</p><p>
    
    It's not as singer/songwriter-goes-all-World-Music-on-our-asses as it sounds, though.  The mournful character of the Greek modes and the gorgeous timbres of the 
    traditional instruments build quite a house for Eitzel's dejected muse to live large in.  The atmosphere is a huge departure from the ProTools ambience that unexpectedly 
    marked 2001's <i>The Invisible Man</i>, and Eitzel sounds unusually comfortable-- his singing here may be the best he's ever done.  Half of the album consists of songs from 
    his days with American Music Club, and the reinventions they get complement the original versions nicely, for the most part.  ""Western Sky"" and ""Last Harbor""-- both from 
    AMC's <i>California</i>-- rank among Eitzel's most haunting compositions, and the treatment the Greek band gives them lends them an effervescence even the original versions 
    didn't quite possess.</p><p>
    
    Manos Ahalinotopoulos crafts a gorgeous melody on pipes for ""Nightwatchman"", and the buoyant drumming of Panos Tolios gives it a confident bounce; this version has a 
    sweep and grace to it that are hard to deny, even if you swear by the original.  ""Take Courage""-- originally from the Eitzel solo set <i>Songs of Love: Live a the Borderline</i>-- is beautified 
    by Manos Pirovolakis' Cretan lyra countermelodies, and is one of several songs that makes the case that there needs to be more mandolin on rock albums.  Thoughtful violin 
    orchestration, pensive clarinet and sympathetic drumming turn ""Will You Find Me?"" (from AMC's excellent <i>Mercury</i>) into a rich meditation where it was once stark and unrelentingly 
    bleak.</p><p>
    
    The biggest shock, and the biggest misstep, on the album is the version of ""Here They Roll Down"", originally the opening track from AMC's first truly great album, <i>United 
    Kingdom</i>.  Where the definitive version blends with a field recording of a highway underpass and ends with an odd false crescendo, this version is full of squealing cacophony, 
    mostly from wind instruments, while Eitzel sings the lyrics about directionless motorists almost without regard to the weirdness flailing around him.  It's...strange, and while it's 
    certainly a bold track, it doesn't fit.</p><p>
<i>The Ugly American</i> closes with a cover of a song by producer Manolis Famellos, which, with its hook of ""She crucified my ruined heart so sweetly,"" is perhaps a tad more 
    melodramatic than most of Eitzel's work, but nonetheless fits the mood of the album well.  For Eitzel's loyal core of fans, this is obviously required purchasing, if only for the 
    versions of such difficult-to-find gems as ""What Good Is Love?"" (from a tour-only disc) and the two Songs of Love tracks (""Jenny"" and ""Take Courage"").  <i>The Ugly American</i> stands 
    well on its own, though, and certainly proves Eitzel to be a more versatile performer than he sometimes seems.  For a loop in the holding pattern, it delivers 
    much more than expected.</p></div>"|2701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2701-the-ugly-american/|7.7|Joe Tangari

As soon as I slipped the disc into my Walkman,
    hit play, and heard indie glitch-pop, I was crestfallen. At the time, I was only familiar with the German group as the architects of ""Scoop"", a sublime click-infused slice
    of ambient techno, one of the highlights of Morr Music's 2000 compilation, <i>Putting the Morr Back in Morrissey</i>. The record had just been released in Germany,
    and the only pre-album press I had seen for <i>Neon Golden</i> was a prominently placed review in French music mag <i>Les Inrockuptibles</i>, which I had
    thumbed through at a newsstand but alas couldn't read. My hopes dashed, it took a few weeks for me to embrace, and eventually love, the album.</p><p>
    The change in direction and sound of this newest release by Notwist leader Markus Acher's other, arguably more established group Lali Puna isn't anywhere near
    as jarring as the difference between ""Scoop"" and <i>Neon Golden</i>, but it's certainly a left turn. After two rewarding albums of melodic, warm digital melodies,
    Lali Puna's <i>Left Handed</i> EP prominently features (gasp!) guitar.</p><p>
    The title track of this slender three-song, 13-minute EP begins with a frantic pulsating synth, but it's soon overpowered by Acher's familiar, churning six-string.
    More forceful than in any of his recent Notwist work-- although still far from the band's punk roots-- the track briefly gives center stage to Valerie Trebeljahr's melancholy
    voice and pensive lyrics, before building into a thrashing climax. Blurring the lines between Acher's two most high-profile bands, ""Left Handed"" sounds like a seamless,
    self-made mashup from this ambidextrous artist.</p><p>
    This EP-- Lali Puna's first new release since a 2002 split single with Isan-- is either a teaser to acclimate listeners to a new sound or a curious one-off flavored by the
    contribution of Notwist touring guitarist Max Punktezahl, who earns a co-songwriter credit on the title track. I'm hoping for the former: as entrancing as the band's previous
    efforts are, after two albums of virtually identical moods and sounds, change is welcome. ""Left Handed"" was recorded almost 18 months ago-- around the same time as
    <i>Neon Golden</i>-- so, if this was an anomaly rather than a taste of what is to come, it would make little sense to sit so long on its release.</p><p>
    The EP's second track, ""Left Handed Dub"", is equally wonderful. A remix of the title track, it's at first built on dub's recognizable explorations of space and use of echo, but
    quickly speeds its pace and slides into an engrossing mélange of spongy phrases and rhythms. Delicately layered, it moves from gurgling beats to spy-film paranoia to
    engrossing warmth without any neck snapping.</p><p>
    Filling out the EP is the band's cover of Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder's ""Together in Electric Dreams"", first released on the 2000 tribute album <i>Reproductions:
    The Songs of the Human League</i>. Oakey and Moroder's track is more notable for the collaboration itself than the result, which is a surprisingly limp ballad. Lali Puna's
    cover is an improvement, retreating into introspection and infusing the song with passive-aggressive resignation.</p><p>
    The inclusion here of ""Together in Electric Dreams"" does cheekily nod to what is striking about the title track. If Lali Puna plan to retain the guitar as a fixture in their sound,
    the song's key sentiment-- a fleeting love that will ""always be...in electric dreams""-- seems an appropriate, sweet farewell to the band's all-synth days.</p></div>"|4647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4647-left-handed-ep/|6.7|Scott Plagenhoef

    Chapter 11: Projects Purporting to be ""Diverse"": How to Proceed</p><p>
    
    I.</p><p>
    
    When a recording artist or their promotional team/record label describes his or her latest record, and the word ""diverse"" gurgles its way out of their ambitious throats, your mind 
    should immediately expect one of two definitive reactions to the music and album in question:</p><p>
    
    1. Said album will exhibit a lack of interest in being ""diverse""; artists in question will be mixing styles and sounds purely for the experience of taking on new 
    challenges and incorporating favored styles. Interest in exposure on multiple radio formats and the maximum number of British magazine covers rates low on the fulfillment 
    scale. See The Flaming Lips' <i>The Soft Bulletin</i> and Super Furry Animals' <i>Guerilla</i> for detailed examples. Note the confidence in the composition and the resulting pleasurable 
    listening experience.</p><p>
    
    2. Said album will present an unsure and uneven collection of oddly juxtaposed compositions, some embellishing a familiar genre with elements of a presently 
    lucrative or otherwise commercially validated sound. Songs will cover no less than three areas of music, and shall name no less than 6 on their promotional materials. Furthermore, 
    the artists in question will no doubt stack the weights in their favor, inviting an otherwise respectable musician to join in on the ""diverse"" project.</p><p>
    
    Possibility Number 2 is our primary concern, as it represents nearly 2/3rds of ""genre-hopping"" projects available for consumption. The following is a case study of a weak and 
    forgettable album being marketed as ""diverse,"" including tips for the music consumer on how to avoid albums and artists seeking to sell their aimless recordings with similar tactics. 
    You will find a copy of the case study enclosed with the Manual's supplemental materials.</p><p>
    
    II.</p><p>
    
    Case Study: <i>Invent Modest Fires</i> by the group Ghost Cauldron</p><p>
    
    Released in 2003, said album was brought to the market by the !K7 label, a known purveyor of electronics-based recordings. Said album was distributed in its promotional 
    form with a sticker extolling the virtues of the Ghost Cauldron project and its founder, the former member of a German group called Terranova. Said sticker claimed that contained 
    on the enclosed compact disc were ""not only...breakbeats and techno vibes but also folk and rock elements as well."" This should immediately alert your suspicion. The vagueness 
    of the terminology (""techno,"" in particular, is one you would do well to remember) and the dangerous sentence fragment that follows should send up red flags for 
    the conscientious consumer.  ""This album is diverse as ever...""</p><p>
    
    If we have the benefit of a CD player and a free copy of the album Invent Modest Fires, an intense inspection of the recorded material is our best evidence in exposing this music, 
    parading as ""diverse,"" as lackluster and stale.</p><p>
    
    Step 1. Play Track 1, ""Fire Walk With Me"", now.</p><p>
    
    As the reference to David Lynch suggests, this track and the cut that follows are preoccupied with cinematics, composed with a soundtrack artist's ear for musical cues and 
    movements. This is montage music with no montage, a mixture of interesting string arrangements backed by fairly stale and uninspired drum programming, no doubt evidence of the 
    ""techno"" element and its failings. Track 2 ups the ante by featuring Priest of Anti-pop Consortium, whose horror-core delivery nearly saves the song from drowning in its own ominous 
    melodrama. Consumer beware: the inclusion of a familiar face is a clever ruse, a way to slip past your defenses and set up shop. Tread carefully.</p><p>
<i>Note: At this point it may be useful to reference Track 5, ""Fear"", which features the entire Anti Pop crew. While listening, try to determine if an increase in guest talent correlates to a 
    decrease in the blandness of the song itself.</i></p><p>
    
    Step 2. Play Track 3, ""See What I've Become"" and Track 8, ""Right Now"", consecutively.</p><p>
    
    The inclusion of solemn acoustic ballads and brit-pop genre-mixing projects is a standard approach in these cases; see DJ Muggs' <i>Dust</i> for prototypical examples of this technique. 
    Ghost Cauldron employ the nasally warble of Nick Taylor on these tracks, somber affairs that cover predictable rock territory, perhaps leaning towards the brit-pop side of things, but 
    remaining moody. Beyond appearing to be mere calculations-- attempts to blanket a more broad target audience-- said tracks contain insipid lyrics, rigid drum-machine accompaniment, 
    and an overall lack of inspiration. Be careful, as many participants easily forget these songs, and repeat Step 2 multiple times.</p><p>
    
    Step 3. Play Track 11, ""Death Before Disco"", now.</p><p>
    
    Often times, one or two compositions on a ""genre-hopping"" project such as <i>Invent Modest Fires</i> will expose the musician's true calling, interest, or talent. The result is a feeling of 
    angst in the listener, an uncertainty of how to judge the project in question. As a fine slice of electro-inspired, Legowelt-ish electronica, the track in question sounds fresh and interesting, 
    suggesting an obvious love of the referenced genres and, in effect, imbuing the song with authenticity, unquestionable by even the most jaded music consumer. Although we are almost 
    finished proving the worthlessness of this ""diverse"" project, it is important to note that every failure can be expected to contain some percentage of success, no matter how minimal. </p><p>
    
    Step 4 and Conclusion. Please read the ""File Under"" copy included with the compact disc.</p><p>
    
    As !K7 would have you see it, Ghost Cauldron is all things to all music-loving people, encompassing ""breaks, trip-hop, post-rock, electro, rap, techno"" in an effortless, fluid mix. As a music 
    consumer, compound words used as descriptors should give us pause. Note also the broad categories mentioned, how they leave plenty of room for interpretation, in many ways akin to 
    legal jargon and legislation: !K7 cannot be held responsible if their definition of post-rock and trip-hop do not emulate your own, and Ghost cauldron can't be libeled in the event of such a 
    discrepancy. Trust your instincts: if  a project purports to draw influence from all corners of the musical realm, it's your duty to be suspicious, your right to be 
    incredulous. In far too many situations, the compact disc you hold in your hand is a half-baked conglomerate of industry buzzwords not intended to shake your ass, but to 
    lick your ear and remove the contents of your wallet.</p></div>"|3624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3624-invent-modest-fires/|2.9|Mark Martelli

    hip-hop sincerely, rather than as shock ammunition.  Beats are back?  Looking back, I can't recall them leaving: we had the same revelation about ten
    years ago when the Beasties picked up their instruments (again), Cypress Hill met Lollapalooza, and Beck decided to quit fucking around in his bedroom and
    fuck around in the top 40 instead.  And of course that whole Madchester thing a few years earlier, when Shaun Ryder's Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses decided
    it was easier to be wasted in the pocket than out; before that, Blondie and Talking Heads shook their left feet as PIL and Gang of Four dangled their right lobes.
    When people say that dance is back, they probably mean ""dance is not currently a guilty pleasure for some people who might otherwise be sulking in the corner

    remorselessly abrasive debut, <i>Cone Toaster</i> makes the case that, if there had ever been a rift between the 24 hour party people and the nighthawks at the
    diner, it was purely for show.  As if it took this release to spell it out, the lines between rock blast and disco panache (or a
    ""metal-disco fusion"" as longtime Pitchfork booster Chuck Eddy once called it) are often blurry to the point of being confused for one another.  At
    this point, why bother?</p><p>
    
    Side-A features the title track: a new, semi-lengthy excursion into the nether regions of ugly escapism.  Beginning with cut-up cymbals on the left,
    warped guitar samples on the right and a big messy whump in the middle, you'd be forgiven for thinking the band had gone Fennesz on us.  And then
    she hits: bump-bump-bump-bump goes the bass drum, and just to show you they're still hard, they substitute scraping, metallic pogo for house
    hi-hat.  The occasional shimmer of guitar hints at the electric ocean music of <i>Beaches &amp; Canyons</i>, but when the drums come in, it's clear that Black Dice
    want to be considered, first and foremost, a dance band with a noise fetish, rather than the other way around.  Because of the various noises (drastically erratic,
    pitch-shifted synth and occasional generator hum), I'm not sure how well this would go over at your party, but rest assured no one will have trouble
    finding the beat.  They end the piece by speeding up to a tribal, tom-laden race into space.  A voice-sample is sliced into small fragments, cycled
    repeatedly, while the reverb all around soaks up residual clamor; the end result is spacey, but alluring, and almost psychedelic.</p><p>
    
    Boredoms' Yamatsuka Eye remixes  ""Endless Happiness"" from <i>Beaches &amp; Canyons</i> on the second side.  If ""Cone Toaster"" represented the breaking point of a
    noise band coming to terms with groove, ""Endless Happiness"" revels in carefree celebration of it.  The song should be a warning siren to anyone in
    doubt about either the roots of Black Dice's change of heart, or the future of this music, to which the opening alarm clang clatter attests.  However,
    soon afterwards, jazz bass and light bells paint a much subtler picture.   When the soft beat comes in, the tune takes on a light, tropical ambience
    perfectly suited to an oceanfront sunset.  Eye brings it down a little more before introducing a thick, howling sample and pumping up the festival drums
    full bore.  At that point, it sounds fairly similar to some of recent Boredoms adventures (particularly from the Shock City Shockers projects),
    and anyone enamored with that sound should be feeling pretty good.  Eye has a nice way of introducing fairly noisy elements into the mix with
    considerable grace, subtracting them just as well, so that, even though there's always a lot happening, it never seems too busy.  Nice track.</p><p>
    
    Normally, the question might now be, ""what's next?""  We know Black Dice are in the midst of making music for their upcoming full-length, and one can
    only assume it will be along the lines set forth on this primer.  So far, they appear to be following a clear path to something pretty interesting,
    and if someone wants to label them a dance band now, so be it: I'll take whatever they've got when the results are as consistently
    engaging...hell, when they <i>jam</i> as much as this.</p></div>"|746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/746-cone-toaster-12/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    our coffee-stained fangs into. Producing the kind of unassuming cheery pop their moniker would indicate, <i>2</i> offers up a plethora of 
    armor chinks for a hardened soul to exploit; in fact, if it didn't sound so unpleasantly racial, I'd almost
    describe it as all chink.</p><p>
    
    But even stolid mopers have to admit that <i>2</i> stays remarkably on-message in its delivery, and without the
    protective shell of irony one might expect from the shield with a K in it.  Providing fifteen distortion-flavored bubblegum 
    songs in twenty-nine minutes, <i>2</i> is something like The Ramones without that
    pesky Y chromosome and all the macho behavior that comes with it.  Topics span from marrying boys to
    dancing with boys to stealing boys from other girls, the vocals are chipper than chip, and the music is the
    sort that provokes wanton tired comparisons to sugary foods.</p><p>
    
    It's a combination that could easily provoke toothaches (oof, sorry), but generally, they pull it off, 
    endearing enough to earn a solid place as open-window fare.  Musical stalker-valentine ""Jason Lee"" is 
    particularly over-winning, despite its content resemblance to that fifteen-minute novelty ""David
    Duchovny"" song, and maybe because I too have a bit of a crush on Mr. Lee myself.  
    Songs fortified with keyboards, never mind how obvious (""Video Game Heart"" features joystick laser 
    noises, ""Samantha Secret Agent"" 60s spy-movie organ) stand out above the go-go surf-drum fray of perky 
    mantras like ""Becky"" and ""Million Things"".</p><p>
    
    If there's a criticism to be made-- other than the dead horse of one-dimensionality-- it's one that would
    require a lot more women's studies textbooks than I happen to own, not to mention one that we already
    sorta covered in our review of their debut.  Perhaps I'm suffering from pseudo-liberal oversensitivity, but
    it's a bit worrisome that an all-girl summer fun band would necessarily have to sound like a quartet of 12
    year-olds in the subject matter of their music.  Since ""Jason Lee"" drops the knowledge that at least one
    member is 33, it seems a bit regressive for another vocalist to be yearning to ""run around like a puppy
    dog"" elsewhere on the album, as nice as that sounds against a three-chord fuzz backdrop.  Couldn't they
    aspire to more mature lyrics in a pop setting, like Neko Case's bold statement (to my ears) of ""I don't
    need eventual dance halls/Just a bill from a restaurant?""</p><p>
    
    Okay, I don't know what the fuck that means either.  And come to think of it, Fountains of Wayne are
    currently on M2 talking about how Stacy's mom has got it goin' on, so maybe it isn't a gender problem at
    all, but an issue for the whole power-pop-ulation.  But here's a wish going out to the women of the All
    Girl Summer Fun Band, a wish for <i>3</i>, <i>4</i>, and so on to feature more mature subject matter while preserving
    the spry slices of two-minute July they've perfected.  Because last I checked, us old people can still have
    some summer fun on occasion too.</p></div>"|114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/114-2/|6.9|Rob Mitchum

Now they're Quannum Projects, talent incubator for the West Coast
    underground. Their latest project is the Lifesavas, two kids from Portland who rap but didn't start out as MCs: Jumbo the Garbageman is a sample-monger at
    heart, and Vursatyl is really a streetwise vocalist. This works, as Jumbo's punchy vamps only get expanded by veteran producer Chief Xcel (of Blackalicious fame),
    and Vursatyl's subdued hooks are broken up by a whole guesthouse full of mercenary rappers (including Gift of Gab, Latyrx, and J-Live). Still, while there's no
    lack of variety in structure, style, and content, after a few listens one starts pining for the instrumentals.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Soldierfied"" is a janky, thorax-blunting session, typical of the clean kicks and filthy snares to follow. The battle rhymes, impelled more by
    villainous vamps than any heartfelt hostility, bleed over into ""It's Over"": ""Who cares if you can rhyme in Arabic with a Portuguese accent [and] recorded your
    demo 30 below zero in the basement of a Buddhist shrine?"" Vursatyl first breaks out his street-smoothed singing voice in ""What If It's True?"", a catchy,
    vacant jam on the level of, say, the Black-Eyed Peas. It's great that Quannum isn't afraid to hire the occasional session musician, and the rhythm tracks stay
    compulsively spare and unpretentious; the only real musical letdowns on the album come a good forty minutes later, with the rushed and unrappable ""Emerge""
    and a flat rehearing of ""Blackbird"".</p><p>
    
    In ""Hellohihey"", Vursatyl plays the ghosts of his own egos past, present and future, in a trite but well-executed parable about ego trips, whose punchline draws
    a nice distinction between raw egotism and healthy self-hype. The rest of the morals on <i>Spirit in Stone</i>, however, are less predictable and more controversial:
    one song manages to come out against abortion, cloning, sodomy, pornography and war almost in the same breath. So when Lifesavas say, ""Careful what you
    rep of the new left, only a few left,"" it's an open question whether they're counting themselves. Like good liberals, they distance themselves from oil politics,
    corporate scandals, and terror profiling. So what do they want? First, reparations for slavery. Then ""revenge for the engineered virus, slit they eyelids, carve a image
    in they iris."" Are you listening, Howard Dean?</p><p>
    
    It just gets weirder as a Last Judgment vibe takes over the album's farthest reaches. ""5th Horseman"" is a mix of undead camp and apocalyptic politics. ""Inventing proverbs
    in the hot tub-- famine, pestilence: here come the fifth horseman in a b-boy stance!"" This is not your pastor's Book of Revelations. Then ""Skeleton"" wins the Most Unlikely
    Sample prize for 2003, dunking a folk ghost song into a nasty, swaggering clav pocket (""Have you seen the ghost of John?/ Long white bones and the rest all gone/
    Wouldn't it be chilly with no skin on?""). Here Lifesavas take a break from abrasive self-righteousness to make room for some real, if stale, theological speculation: ""The
    world's worst death was in the kiss,"" they muse. ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing us he didn't exist."" There's no danger of that for these rappers,
    who must either see a lot of movies, or a world of men teeming with Satan's work. Everyone else will have to get by on faith that the instrumental album exists.</p></div>"|4945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4945-spirit-in-stone/|6.8|Jascha Hoffman

    sac of 2000's <i>Pole 3</i>, I've wondered where Pole would (or could) go next. Betke had seemingly squeezed everything he could from a broken Waldorf
    filter, hiss, crackles and room-shaking bass (and all things considered he extracted some very good music); his next full-length record, it seemed,
    would involve a new direction out of necessity.</p><p>
    
    And so it does. As previewed on two EPs (<i>45/45</i> and <em>90/90, the latter being more of a DJ tool with its multiple versions of a single track), Pole has
    scrubbed up his sound considerably, fleshed out his beats with upfront drums, and opened himself to collaboration. The noise that previously filled
    the chasms of space-- all the sonic byproduct that used to all but define him as a producer-- are essentially gone. In fact, you may not hear a cleaner 
    record this year. As for the collaborators, the most notable addition is backpack rapper Fat Jon, who lends his lyrics and his dispassionate diction
    to four of the record's nine tracks. Other tracks include acoustic bassist August Engkilde and saxophonist Thomas Haas. Taken together, these changes
    completely shuffle the deck for Pole.</em></p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, it doesn't come up aces. <em>Pole</em> has some worrying problems, starting with the tracks featuring Fat Jon. On the one hand, given
    the sparking minimalism of Pole's new musical direction, Fat Jon seems a logical choice for vocals. His style is equally clear and precise, and he
    can rap with speed and skillfully navigate complex phrases without losing the rhythm. His lyrical interests tend toward the phenomenological, probing
    the nature of the way we experience time, love, and struggle, among other concerns, and they are not without insight. But Fat Jon's style is so
    removed, so focused on the word at the expense of quirkiness or hooks (each of his choruses is just a phrase repeated <em>ad nauseum</em>), his raps just
    hang there like another element on the Cubase grid. Even allowing for lack of interest and knowledge in underground rap, Fat Jon still strikes me as a
    rather dull stylist. There is no tension when his voice is set against Pole's beats, and the pairing ends up being <em>too</em> complimentary.</p><p>
    
    Generous collaborator that he is, Betke's backing tracks for Fat Jon are just that, background loops used to support vocalist's ideas in the words.
    Betke stretches a bit more on Pole's five instrumentals, and in a few of these are seeds for a potentially interesting album. The honking saxophone
    that Haas adds fills the stainless steel dub of ""Bushes (There is a Secret Behind)"" provides just the sort of tonal contrast that the track needs (it's
    also the only track with a hint of a crackle). ""Green is Not Green (Yellow)"" also has some of Hass' riffing, this time with Engkile adding some loping 
    upright bass. It's one of the loosest and funkiest Pole tracks extant, and, with its melodica accents, is the most dub selection on <em>Pole</em> by far.
    I already raved about ""Back Home"" when I talked about the <i>45/45</i> EP; suffice to say that it's a glowing surge of joy more nakedly emotional than you
    imagined a Pole track could be. Pole goes out on a limb on ""Back Home"" and it works; elsewhere, he goes out on a limb and it doesn't. In lieu of a
    green-sleeved <em>Pole 4</em>, we take what we can get.</p></div>"|6370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6370-pole/|5.5|Mark Richardson

Smith and your grandma, it's still The Fall. My granny has more teeth these days, but The Fall have proven more durable 
    than anyone could have fathomed. From their inception in the wake of a 1976 Sex Pistols show in Manchester, line-up shifts have partially disguised 
    how rigorously stripped-down The Fall's sound has always been, and how enervating the noise is.  Of course, the accommodating, slight sugary pop brought 
    on board by wife Brix made the bitter musings of M.E.S. popularly palatable for a decade, but it still comes down to the singular, caterwauling caustics 
    of that ex-dock worker, and the relentless drums thudding behind him.</p><p>
    Smith is cantankerous enough to combine the wit of Peter Hammill with the purely physical, fricative qualities of the human mouth, a là Henri Chopin, 
    all with an equal affinity for adenoidal rockabilly acetates and crackling Big Youth dub plates. Such a simple formula delivers variations on these lingual 
    themes in thick rap-speak and hiccupping hollers to make Smith a singular creature in pop music, carrying forth unabated throughout his existence.</p><p>
    But The Fall plop out at least two discs a year.  It's always been hard to keep up; in fact, a new BBC collection and box set of 2001 bootlegs have surfaced 
    just as of this writing.  Even the most devout fans I know gave up after <i>The Frenz Experiment</i>, though a few diehards stuck it out until Brix's return 
    (she left Mark in the late 80s) on <i>Light User Syndrome</i> (1996).  Even the stalwarts have surely been overwhelmed by the deluge of scrap material 
    released since. To that end, these two reissues straddle the band's career.</p><p>
<i>It's the New Thing!</i> compiles the burgeoning croaks of the group, when they were signed with Step Forward, who released four Fall singles and two 
    albums. The ground plans are laid bare on this set in the sneering manifestos that would inform each and every step Smith took thereafter. Soundbites 
    such as ""We are the Fall; Northern white crap that talks back"" couldn't hit the nail any harder or more precisely on the head, were it not for the even earlier a-side ""Repetition"", 
    which shows his hand and their MO from that instance forth. Calling out for ""white noise"" at the start, Mark E. details the three R's of his music: ""Repetition, 
    repetition, repetition...Repetition's in our music and we're never gonna lose it."" Can't say he didn't warn us.</p><p>
    ""Frightened""-- the first cut off of <i>Live at the Witch Trials</i> (1977)-- reveals a tune as overtly anthemic as anything else the Fall would attempt for the next twenty-five 
    years, the beats and chords reveling in a freedom that Smith would soon nip in the bud, snipping the melodic elements out of the group altogether. 
    ""Rebellious Jukebox"" is a jangly pop slice that shows a side to the band that wouldn't be resurrected --and ridden to its artistic peak-- until Brix hitched up 
    with the old man in '83. ""Rowche Rumble"" is weird, wiry springs of gut-string guitars quivering as tympanicky thuds jerks about like jacked-up jokers, Smith 
    jeering at valium addicts and their ""suppliers,"" a sound joyous and addictive.</p><p>
<i>Dragnet</i> (1979) is by far the roughest and most assiduously lo-fi of Fall albums (not counting live albums like <i>Totale's Turns</i>), but still hides great flashes in its murk. 
    ""Psykick Dancehall"" is close to a Fall standard, the verbiage a skull chock-full of paranoia, hipster-pricks, record collections, and other hobgoblins of the mind. 
    ""Spectre Vs Rector"" is as much a minimal rock tape composition as it is an eight-minute epic of New Zealand scene-spawning, as cheap-speaker 
    fibrillations, iniquitous riff-noise, and wobbly cassette wheels push about, loutish and callous, even as the beat of the band clanks to life amongst the distorted 
    live tape backing.</p><p>
    Castle Music cannot decide if its trying to compile all of the Fall's singles from this time period or re-release the first two albums (<i>Live at the Witch Trials</i> 
    and <i>Dragnet</i>), so instead, <i>It's the New Thing!</i> does neither. Early Fall sides like ""Bingo-Masters Break-Out"", ""Various Times"", ""In My Area"", and ""Psykick 
    Dancehall 2"" are dropped. Four tracks are left off of <i>Dragnet</i> and the middle of <i>Live</i> is gutted. It's not one-stop shopping, but the crucial stuff is all jammed 
    in here.</p><p>
    For all the highlights of that one disc, the three CD set <i>Time Enough at Last</i> culls together the head-scratching discs that followed in the wake of the ho-hum 
    <i>Light Syndrome User</i> from 1996.  <i>Oxymoron</i>, <i>Cheetham Hill</i>, and <i>15 Ways to Leave Your Man</i> appeared on each other's heels with nary 
    a personnel description or explanation as to their point.  <i>15 Ways</i> is a somewhat tepid live show from London's Astoria in 
    1996, but both accompanying records have live tracks thrown in to confound matters further.  Such is the story of Receiver records' pillaging of The Fall's back catalog: shameless, 
    excessive, inexplicable.  Unutterable</p><p>
<i>Oxymoron</i> is an album package of lips and assholes (literally), with shitloads of vocal processing on Mark E.'s sneer, an unrepentant setting for the clap 
    tracks, and painfully dated drum programming. It somehow works with the Peter Gunn-guitar riffs on the title track and the dateless bounce that the Fall 
    does so effortlessly on ""Powder Keg"". Even with a near hip-hop pattern that simultaneously loads some New Order synth patches in, ""White Lines"" is 
    tolerable, and it has nary a whine or word in sight. But who could withstand the limpid rap Brix does on ""Glam Racket"", which positively reeks of her time spent 
    in the widow Love's shadow, auditioning as a replacement for Hole's overdosed bassist.  Another instro shows up as an ""Italiano"" roadster, pumping 
    cheap acid F/X as it whizzes past. This reveals the repackaging problems that originally plagued this stretch of the Fall discography: not even twenty minutes 
    have passed, and already ""Oxymoron"" is rechristened ""He Pep!"" and given the run-through once again. ""Interlude/Chilinism"" turns up on <i>Cheetham Hill</i> 
    as ""The Chisellers"", and again in a live form as, uh, ""Chilinist"".  ""E.S.P. Disco"" = ""Psykick Dancehall"" live.</p><p>
<i>Cheetham Hill</i> suffers similarly as the first disc, as a scrap heap with a few gleanable keepers like the mellowed ""Time Enough at Last"". The track listing is 
    cluttered with castaways from such indistinguishable Fall albums like <i>Code: Selfish</i>, <i>Cerebral Caustic</i> and <i>The Light User Syndrome</i>. While it's handy to 
    have all the dubious titles that Receiver first foisted on the public in one box, there's so many titles vying for attention that all but the heartiest of 
    Fall-ophiles will already have passed the saturation point into nausea well before you have time enough to go through all of these.</p></div>"|2971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2971-its-the-new-thing-the-step-forward-years/|8.2|Andy Beta

Perhaps comparable to an early '90s Blackjack 
    cut-out, a gas-huffing Acid Mothers Temple, Monoshock-- especially the 1996 opus <i>Walk To The Fire</i>-- or an amphetamine-dosed 
    Blue Cheer, the Santa Cruz quartet Comets on Fire creates sonic defibrillation through burning patch cords, distended Echoplex 
    and endless reserves of frenetic rock-n-roll zeal; at their best, the jams are so all-encompassing and tightly suffocating, they let off a 
    visionary flair, lighting up the nighttime sky of modern garage rock dreck, akin to the time you stumbled across the off-kilter pawnshop halo 
    surrounding 13th Floor Elevators, or the freeform hippie stargazing of Angus Maclise's <i>Brain Damage in Oklahoma City</i>.</p><p>
    
    The band certainly deserves this reissue of its out-of-print 2001, vinyl-only debut, and the venerable Alternative Tentacles does one better, 
    generously including six additional, sprawling songs recorded during a howling, raw concert in 2000 (and pre-dating last year's more eclectically tweaked 
    <i>Field Recordings From the Sun</i> [Ba Da Bing!]). Here, the sprawl doesn't dig paths into Ben Chasny's No Six Organs of Admittance psych prettiness; instead, the band 
    fixates on an endless dose of desperate, over-amplified histrionics, fronted by a distorted martyr with rocks in his mouth. Blustering through 
    more 4-channel explosions than most can probably handle in a single sitting, Comets on Fire avoids slowing down the action or turning down the ear-fracturing skree 
    for over an hour: gilt feedback connects, extends, and exudes, dangling from the ceiling as shiny, fractured stalactites.</p><p>
    
    Starting the proper album off a-squealin', ""All I Need"" is an acid-rock, noise version of tuning, until some seconds into the track, when the various threads of 
    feedback stitch together and bang forward into a washed-out, garbled rock anthem. Ethan Miller's voice-- as outer-limits as his guitar-- treads the 
    waves beyond all the distortion, only allowing brief glances at a few stranded words about grave robbers in love, cosmic ghosts, and miasmatic plagues. Really, 
    though, actual verbal comprehension is secondary to the full-on atmosphere the band constructs: they focus on patterning, momentary pauses, dynamics, and you're left 
    waiting for the roof to cave in under the barometric pressure. The great thing about the echoplex is the way it spreads over any potential blank 
    spaces during the course of the album, like the splatter painting of Pollock spun askew through some centrifugal fuck-up. After the opener, 
    the brief hand-clapped raga ""Rimbaud Blues"" is the only sustained breakdown until the album's end.</p><p>
    
    The live show begins following a two-minute pause at the end of ""Days of Vapors"", the final, gloriously decomposed track from the original self-titled 
    LP. Like a lot of low-fidelity music recorded in boomy rooms, this concert material is high on the high-end and shrill. Miller's vocals, unfortunately, have too much 
    presence here, losing the denser growl of the album, sometimes congealing enough to make sense. All in all, the live material 
    lacks the fullness of the other recordings (the drums sound super tinny) and perhaps offers some glances at cracks in the astronauts' armor. As with Modest 
    Mouse's <i>Interstate 8</i> EP, also featuring a demo set appended, after a couple listens I forgot to wait for the fuzzier, less interesting material and just edited 
    the bad parts out.</p><p>
    
    While <i>Comets on Fire</i> does lack those ponderous Opeth-textured moments of <i>Field Recordings From the Sun</i>, its unrelenting snarled beastliness is one

Music critics jump at the opportunity to prove the name of an album is 
    indicative of the band itself, or the songs contained within, or some radical turn the band has taken.  It's like overzealous comparative lit majors 
    who forge half-baked relationships between two entirely incongruous pieces of work: ""National Lampoon's <i>Christmas Vacation</i> was 
    clearly informed by 12th century cave paintings of vegetarian mating rituals in South India.""  Ah, the Liberal Arts.</p><p>
    We've endured a the Strokes jabs-- ""No, seriously, is <i>this</i> it? I mean <i>it</i>, like, is it <i>really</i>?""-- or my personal favorite Microphones 
    catcall-- ""It was hot, we stayed in the water...and sucked!""  Sometimes the album title is relevant to content, but all too often, these analogies are wrenched 
    beyond reason for the sake of some pithy introduction.</p><p>
    So humor me for second. If there were any pop band out there today ""built on squares,"" the Starlight Mints would probably be the last you'd 
    suspect. A square is simple, unchallenging, and utterly honest; this quirky Oklahoma ensemble, with its bizarre lyrics to its unconventional pop 
    instrumentation, is the furthest thing from equal sides and right angles. </p><p>
    Pop music in a strict sense, however, is very square and very simple. Ultimately, it breaks down to verse and chorus. Our reaction to it is not 
    intelligent or analytical but visceral: we like the way it sounds, and we often judge pop based on how we feel when we listen to it, not how cleverly we 
    see the chords fitting together or why the composer chose to follow one particular note with another. What drives pop music thex96 and what makes it so intriguing 
    as an artform-- is the challenge of crafting (e.g. intellectualizing) a truly visceral experience. In the most timeless pop music-- and perhaps timeless 
    music in general-- there is a symbiotic relationship between the song's visceral immediacy and the depth of its inner workings. The latter preserves 
    the former, while the former makes the latter relevant.</p><p>
    Immediacy is no hard thing to come by in pop music these days-- saccharine hooks are a dime a dozen. The task in front of today's pop musicians 
    is to maintain immediacy, but to make that physical immediacy ""interesting"" too, which is purely on an intellectual level. The most rudimentary elements 
    of pop-- its squares-- must be rearranged for the sake of the genre itself.</p><p>
    Not to bill them as the saviors of pop, but the Starlight Mints-- in a vein similar to the Decemberists or the mid-90s Cardigans-- are doing just that. 
    <i>Built on Squares</i> finds the band writing enjoyable and refreshingly interesting pop songs: all eleven tracks are fun, catchy and well-conceived, making 
    this very much the logical progression from 2001's <i>The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of</i>. The Mints avoid the pitfall of using variety of instruments as a 
    gimmicky substitute for carefully considered song writing, and what results is an album that comes off natural and effortless, rooted firmly in the squares of 
    pop, where even its orchestro-pop embellishments from violin to trombone to bowling pins at the beginning of ""Irene"" seem uncontrived.</p><p>
    After the opener ""Black Cat"", peppered with quirky string arrangements at its beginning and throughout, the catchy quasi-country romp ""Brass Digger"" 
    bops around, replete with a Cake-like mariachi trumpet, blues harmonica and Alan Vest's oddball lyrics. ""From the Brooklyn train to the other everglades, 
    have you ever met a rat named the Brass Digger?"" As if rats weren't bizarre enough subject matter, the spacey rocker that follows (""Goldstar"") has Vest 
    detailing a run-in with a woman ""kinky like a girl from Mars"" who tries to shoot him with the mysterious ""goldstar gun.""</p><p>
    ""Irene"" is perhaps most indicative of the band's ability to conflate a wide range of seemingly incongruous influences and instrumentations, and from 
    these elements to produce something entirely graceful and original. Fuzz bass, horn lines reminiscent of The Price Is Right, skittering Casiotone twitches, 
    and balls-out AC/DC guitar riffs coexist harmoniously as the kitschy female voice floats atop the mix, singing the 50s bubblegum-ish ""You make my world 
    spin 'round."" For its remarkable depth and business, ""Irene"" never chokes on its own complexity. It is a testament to the meticulous production of <i>Built on 
    Squares</i>, which undoubtedly aspired to instruments not dominating each other in the mix.</p><p>
    It is at once easy and difficult to speak of the Starlight Mints' influences, easy because they are immediately recognizable, difficult because there are so 
    many of them. The album's latter half alone, for instance, features the Weezer-like lilt of ""Zillion Eyes"", a blatant aping of the Kinks' riff from ""All Day and 
    All of the Night"" in ""Jack In The Squares"", and Vest's Bowie-like tremolo in ""Jimmy Cricket"". The Starlight Mints in this sense walk the fine line between 
    sounding like no other band and like every other band before them. Such concerns, however, are neither here nor there when the album is within an 
    earshot; <i>Built on Squares</i> is the fun and catchy work of talented pop musicians, writing terribly interesting songs without compromising pop's essential, 
    visceral lure.</p></div>"|7467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7467-built-on-squares/|7.7|Nicholas B. Sylvester

He's a wholly original singer-- comparisons to Tim Buckley and
    Van Morrison describe his range, but not his timbre.  You can't tell if it's birth, booze or smoking that gave
    his voice that strained, rough sound, with its patterns of uneven wear; or maybe talent and practice put that
    craggy edge onto his smooth moans and tuneful wails, insinuating around a lyric and then hitting a note hard,
    as if he thinks it might hit back.  Even his Swedish accent could just be something else that's wrong with his
    vocal cords.</p><p>
    
    What's most appealing about his new album, <i>Tranquil Isolation</i>, is its stripped-down acoustic setting:
    more than his past albums, this one is carried mostly by his singing.  Even though at heart he's a singer/songwriter,
    Dunger's music is hard to pin down.  He's wandered through many styles, from the lush pop arrangements of his
    last release (2001's <i>Soul Rush</i>) to the quizzical instrumentals and jazzbo sidemen on <i>The Vinyl Trilogy</i>,
    three experimental records that sold in the hundreds.</p><p>
    
    Dunger has doggedly veered far enough off-course to evade commercial success; yet the depth of his vocals and
    the unshakable melodies of his songs stay constant.  I've also noticed that my wife has kept this latest record
    propped on her desk so she can keep an eye on the cover photo, which shows Dunger, standing in a wintery field
    in a sweater and scarf, pretending not to show off his scruffy blond hair and blue eyes.  The guy's got fan
    appeal, no matter how hard he dodges the spotlight.</p><p>
    
    That may be why the rough edges of this album suit him so well.  Dunger made the album with the help of Will and
    Paul Oldham, the alt-country greats who don't need much introduction in these pages.  The Oldhams caught Dunger
    performing with Mercury Rev and were impressed enough to invite him to their home studio in Shelbyville, Kentucky,
    where they cut this album in less than a week.  Like the title suggests, the record just shifts between three
    speeds-- easy-going, bluesy, and regular old ""mellow.""  But that doesn't detract from the spontaneous sound
    that the band brings to the music, or how easily they learned how to push their frontman.  The blues jam that
    opens the disc, ""Last Night I Dreamt of Mississippi"", introduces the earthy sound of Oldham and Dunger's guitars
    ringing alongside each other, while Jessica Bailey's raw-toned violin-- the strongest addition to the record--
    buzzes right into Dunger's range.  Will Oldham also harmonizes beautifully as he sets his clear voice behind
    Dunger's gnarled lead.</p><p>
    
    Dunger wrote all the songs (aside from a traditional Swedish folk song), and every one is winningly tuneful.
    The ballad ""Tribute to Tim Hardin"" glows over a piano that's recorded with a watery nostalgia; that's the only
    studio trick they deploy on this album, but it's a good one, and that ""sounds of memories past"" effect also
    works on well on ""Going Home for Christmas"".  Dunger doesn't shy away from sentimentality, but he also goes for
    sadly resigned (the bleak family scenes of ""1st Runaway"").  When he lightens up he's tough and witty-- resigning
    himself to carrying a torch for the girl on ""Hundred Songs""-- and then he breaks out of the mood with the rollicking
    ""Me, Ray and JR"" (which namechecks Jonathan Richman, though Dunger pronounces it ""Yonathan"").</p><p>
    
    Dunger only falters on the lyrics.  The ""go with the flow"" tone of the sessions make the words seem like an
    afterthought-- like he figured that the band was playing so well that he didn't want to stop them to plan out
    the words.  But with a few exceptions the lyrics seem simplistic, cliched (""Heeeyyyyy mama""), or even bizarre,
    as on ""Me, Ray and JR"": ""We take the stairs/ With all those layers/ You call it betrayal/ So much for the
    nailing of dungeons."" Yeah, it sort of rhymes, but a voice like this should get more resonant lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Aside from that, <i>Tranquil Isolation</i> just gets richer with every listen.  It's strange enough to throw
    off many listeners: alt-country fans would expect something starker, while anyone looking for a straightforward
    adult-alternative singer might've expected him to use something more than a single fiddle to sweeten the album.
    But that randomness is part of the appeal: that Dunger could play so casually with total strangers and use a
    thrown-together band in a foreign studio to make a warm and memorable album.</p></div>"|2479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2479-tranquil-isolation/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

    turned not to how I had just ruined my uncle's wedding ceremony-- knees buckled due to both physical fatigue and uninvited intoxication, the result of the previous 
    evening's bachelor celebration-- but instead to the role of the ever-patient queue that is American society.  Head spinning like a locomotion, the only salient wisp of 
    cognition I had at my disposal was the realization that for all intents and purposes my most time-consuming ""hobby"" was neither music or sports as I had previously 
    considered, but instead the act of waiting blindly in anticipation for the series of events that daily forced their way into my path.</p><p>
    Of course, the national fervor with which our culture stands behind demarcated velvet ropes is not without intent or reward: the goal of all this condoned loitering is obviously 
    the inevitable attainment of some worthwhile prize.  Thus, the cycle fatefully continues: structured quiescence leading to-- hopefully-- unbridled 
    enjoyment, be it the stagnant vegetation of waiting for the next big-thing's debut, or the lip-biting standstill of witnessed betrothal resulting in either drunken bliss at 
    some tented reception or some hard-earned wedding night play.</p><p>
    Trends are not so easily contained by international borders, though: somehow, the American tense-and-ease style of life-- and specifically music-- has imbedded itself 
    directly in the unlikely bosom of Oslo, Norway, deep within the ranks of the Norwegian musical collective Jaga Jazzist, in their latest full-length <i>The Stix</i>.  Fronted by the 
    brothers Horntveth, multi-instrumentalist Lars and drum-programmer Martin, the troupe offers an ebb and flow of tight musical compositions derived from such varied 
    influences as free jazz, Squarepusher-drum 'n bass, and Duke Ellington's original big band.</p><p>
    ""Kitty Wú"" begins the album with a low, breathy sigh, as a heavy reed mimics a high register tune before evolving into a fully orchestrated and electronically manipulated 
    pulse of breakdown and return.  From this, a modal progression ascends through the wind and finally collapses into a treated vibraphone, as the skittering sound of 
    drum 'n bass breaks play constantly in the background, only occasionally rising to the forefront of the track.  Eventually, the lazy coda of the composition is picked up anew 
    by the harder-through-comparison ""Day"" and ""Another Day"" suite, the two songs accenting an informal beat, the host to the breezy synth-driven melody.  Sounding like a 
    mid-80s Stereolab soundtrack to a black and white Audrey Hepburn film, the tracks highlight the album's peak with a generous tension supplied between instrumental 
    give and take, enjoyable in the same manner as early Tortoise or the most recent Cinematic Orchestra full-length.</p><p>
    With the exception of a few minor flourishes of awe and surprise littered throughout the remainder of the album-- for example, the high-end fuzz of the previous <i>Animal Chin</i> 
    EP track ""Toxic Dart"", the nursery rhyme skitter of ""Doppelganger"", and the slow salsa beat of ""I Could Have Killed Him In The Sauna""-- <i>The Stix</i> is unfortunately plagued by 
    the merit of its own complexity and taut instrumentation.  This blandness of production and composition often results in leaving the listener with compulsory feelings of 
    neglect between the rare moments when the group actually loosens up enough for the music to sound pleasurable as opposed to forced.</p><p>
    Allowing for the inclusion of what appears to be found sound recordings of a distant panting animal and some industrial clatter, ""Reminders"" prompts a promising introduction 
    that initially seems to excuse the above rejoinder, but ultimately falls into a homogeneous and glossy pattern of dense muzak that is nearly as compelling as a trip to the local 
    dry-goods store.  Following this outline of polish and glean is ""Suomi Finland"", a gushing mesh of instruments of both acoustic and electronic origin that regrettably succumbs 
    to the group's prominent love of 60s-era spy soundtracks and cheesy synth-programs.</p><p>
    ""Aerial Bright Dark Round"" and ""The Stix"" make noble attempts at dredging the rather forgettable second half of the album from its musical muck-- the former yielding 
    its structure to sinister atonal swarms, the latter staggering its melody with a series of sharp electronic pulses-- but, for the sake of the album, it is a case of too little too late.  
    Perhaps it's my overall impatience, but <i>The Stix</i> could benefit from a lessening of the stick in favor of the carrot; an occasional jolt of humanity would endear 
    Jaga Jazzist's songs to heart, rather than pushing us away with the pretensions of this particularly objective slab of instrumental 
    music.  Though there's more than enough undisputed talent in this group to produce a series of wonderful albums in the future-- balanced in terms of likeability 
    and technical skill-- for the moment <i>The Stix</i> is the line in the sand I'll wait for Jaga Jazzist to cross.</p></div>"|4194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4194-the-stix/|6.6|Andrew Bryant

I imagined that by the time I hit my late twenties, a wave would have
    kicked up, of groups made up of people my age, who'd been listening to the same records I had: indie rockers weaned on floofy English
    moaners like Morrissey and the Psychedelic Furs and the masculine American energy of Dinosaur Jr. or the Pixies; indie rockers who
    understood both the charm of romantic, British new-wave pop and the rush of American guitar-fetish snap-and-jangle; indie rockers who could
    crank those things together and run them through a decade's progress into something all fresh and glistening. Maybe even indie rockers who shared
    bashful soft spots for the Sisters of Mercy and the Ocean Blue. All this, I figured-- this second coming of ""college"" or ""post-modern"" rock-- would
    be My Time. Right?</p><p>
    
    Yeah, well, I was fourteen: dim as I was naive. The bands have started coming, of course, but the bulk of them are sort of boring and disappointing,
    no matter how lovable.  The best, New York's Interpol-- a band that explains its creative differences by pointing out that the guitar player is a Smiths man, while the bassist
    prefers the Cure-- are as terrific as they aren't <i>because</i> of their obvious reference points; they succeed by virtue of being just freakishly good on all relevant grounds.
    It's a stretch to expect another.</p><p>
    
    More common are bands like Longwave, whose spacier indie purity is usually likeable and occasionally stirring, but never quite eventful enough to muster much enthusiasm. And worse: a
    lesser scad of proper and inoffensively pleasant Average Guitar Bands.  They know their Pixies riffs back to front.  They've studied the driving jangle
    and guitar arpeggios of bands from both sides of the Atlantic.  They've picked up some atmospherics from stripey-shirted shoegazers, and maybe they're refreshingly unafraid of new wave's
    affectations, synthesizers, poses, and dancing. If they're good-looking, they'll get a video on M2 and sell some records. And that's Elefant, almost exactly, and without prejudice.</p><p>
    
    Elefant are okay, if disappointingly <i>just</i> okay. They feel like a less-British, lighter Interpol (or is that a more-British Longwave?), though their inspirations are probably
    the most Anglophilic of the bunch: frontman and songwriter Diego Garcia has a strong affection for airy poses and washed-out, synthy flower-pop-- one this record can't hide, no
    matter how much it attempts to showcase a muscular rhythm section and rein in the keyboards-- and his melodic pronouncements tend to be scripted like David Bowie croons, despite
    frequent attempts to growl them up a little. If Interpol-- apart from Carlos-- are too rock-boy to have ever really loved a Pet Shop Boys record, well, I'll bet Diego did.  ""Suburbia"", at least.</p><p>
    
    But that's all subtext: for the bulk of <i>Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid</i>'s ten songs, the focus is pretty squarely on the band as a tight-wound, big-room pop/rock troupe. Their potential
    is audible in the first track, ""Make Up"", which kicks in with a wide-open drive from the band's beefily precise rhythm section, drums rolling and ticking in a tense push
    underneath an arrow-straight bass groove; Garcia wanders in casually, tossing off his lines all suave before eventually rolling, repeating, and chewing up the
    phrase ""tastes like candy"" in a way that becomes a signature here. When the guitar breaks through, it's for a wave of superfast arpeggios, and a moment later, it's back to atmospheric
    plucks; guitar-handler Mod's remarkable ability to charge and retreat tastefully is one of the band's biggest strengths.</p><p>
    
    ""Bokkie"" starts with a boxing-bass strut that's more Interpol than Interpol; its chorus hits an album highlight by throwing some uber-new-wave ba-ba-bas between Garcia's
    lines. These guys have been looking too long at their pictures of The Cure-- check the synths on ""Tonight Let's Dance"", or the opening of ""Annie""-- and it's not the kill-me kill-me kill-me sinkholes
    they've picked out of it: it's the rhythm-led pop of ""Just Like Heaven"", stripped down to an American naturalism.</p><p>
    
    The problem is that Garcia isn't about to write any songs that good-- nor, sadly, any songs as good as most of Interpol's, nor any songs as good as those of New York moody-Brit
    recreationists My Favorite (note to Diego: ask them if you can cover ""The Black Cassette""). If <i>Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid</i> has that lovable ten-solid-songs consistency, it's less a matter
    of lacking filler and more a matter of writing a lot of inoffensive but uninspiring tracks that all wander down the same avenues.  Most of them have a hook somewhere you'll shrug
    and admit is decent, but the highlights can be far between, and even those feel more like good craftsmanship than revelations. At worst, the album can be a bit like looking over a tax
    return: everything's printed neatly in place, and it all adds up, but there's nothing to get excited over.</p><p>
    
    Which is one of a few problems I should have noticed in my fourteen-year-old daydream. It's the problem with a lot of bands like this, these shiny American indie bands with their unforced
    and totally-natural nods toward their college-rock records: even when they feel good, sound good-- and look good-- it's not entirely likely to be going anywhere.  A lot has happened
    since the turn of the 90s, and hardly anyone is going to be able to grab that ring as Interpol have.  Tolerable, and occasionally enjoyable as Elefant may be, their trip through
    the looking glass is hardly magical.</p></div>"|2890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2890-sunlight-makes-me-paranoid/|6.9|Nitsuh Abebe

    as luminous as Hot Hot Heat and Jerk with a Bomb-- the sound of a baritone Kristin Hersh fronting an analog
    Ladytron with more heart? Not entirely; The Organ is more like Interpol meets The Shaggs. For example, the
    first song's only lyrics (""Oh goodness me/ We've got to meet/ I need someone to have fun"") are superficial
    cousins of 'Pol's ""I will surprise you sometime/ I'll come around/ When you're down."" Another kinship between
    the two is that their extry-catchy, ridiculously replayable CDs ooze misery-guts. This here typist would pay
    top dollar to borrow Guy Pearce's time machine (that he used to salvage savages like a good whitey) and fly
    to the September 2002 night that The Organ opened for Matador's Fashed Four. The Organ's execution might be
    unsophisticated, but pulling off the refrain ""I can see the hearts sinking"" (barked like a priority item on
    an Ian Curtis wishlist) can't be beginner's luck.</p><p>
    
    Readers with cats named Steven Patrick who mark May 22 by killing uncles and using southpaw grammar, take note:
    Katie Sketch is Miss Moz, croon-floating through the proceedings like a burnished fop-sage. And before you knock
    the simplistic lyrics mostly about how the speaker has become desire's jalopy, remember that an amazing box set
    could be made just of versions of ""Baby Please Don't Go"" (start with Big Joe Williams, then AC/DC, then Them,
    etc).  Savvy does surface, as ""It's Time to Go"" cleverly bemoans a beat scene's ""la da da"" songs with a ""la da
    da"" chorus (less chili-fistedly than Smog's ""Where is the beauty that I once had? I hate songs with questions
    in them"").</p><p>
    
    Befuddlingly, though, this six-songs-in-fourteen-minutes disc is difficult to dissociate from the 1978 zombie
    film <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> (which is no slam of the film's score by The Goblins and Dario Argento):</p><p>
<li> Maybe the bandname (which is supposed to refer to a Hammond X123 that Jenny Smyth plays like a
    beach-carnival spook-house soundtrack) invokes the film's barrage of disembowelin' courtesy of Vietnam-combat-photographer-turned-makeup-effects-ace
    Tom Savini.<p>
<li> Maybe the liner photograph of the band on a mall stairwell invokes the film's zombie-flecked mall setting.<p>
<li> Maybe the band's Canadian-ness is a contributing factor, as <i>Dawn</i>'s central characters were trying
    to get to Canada, and the new remake was filmed there.<p>
<li> <i>Dawn</i> was dark pop, with its weird mix of audience-ingratiation and resulotionless nihilism, and as
    it lingered in theatres throughout 1979, two similarly dual-toned albums would surface whose cavernous minimalism
    is emulated by the buried, angular wedgework of The Organ's guitarist Deborah Cohen: Joy Division's <i>Unknown
    Pleasures</i> and The Cure's <i>Three Imaginary Boys</i> (echoes of Siouxsie's Banshees, who dropped their first
    two during the 78/79 stretch, can also be detected).  (And: The Smiths, major touchstones for The Organ, would
    peak just as <i>Dawn</i>'s sequel, <i>Day of the Dead</i>, emerged in the mid-80s). <i>Dawn</i> even offers
    insight into why we get excited about new revisitations of these old, comfortable worlds: the film's few living
    hypothesize that the zombies come back to the mall because they mechanically recall its importance/centrality.<p>
<li> In addition to being moany and monosyllabic (like... zombies), The Organ's lyrics are about a woman being
    left too alone, just as <i>Dawn</i> was primarily about a woman (Gaylen Ross as the unforgettable Fran) resigned
    to being abandoned in a crapscape (though in accordance with the strangely conservative rules of supposedly
    chaotic apocalypse films, she must be pregnant or otherwise Maryfied/matriarchified-- true of even the recent
    <i>28 Days Later</i>, the zombies of which pick up where the fast-moving undead of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller""
    video left off.) (And damn if Chris Eccleston isn't in both <i>Later</i> and that movie about Joy Division
    dying and coming back as zombies called The Happy Mondays.)<p>
<li> The Organ's Katie Sketch sings of being emotionally torn and rent, just as human skin in zombie hands pulls
    apart like fig newtons or salt water taffy (""There Is Nothing I Can Do"" deals with either gore or innocence:
    the speaker is either cutting paper or herself).<p>
<li> The admittedly novice rhythm section plods like those hobbly old-school zombies, which can make the band
    sound like it's decomposing or about to crumble apart. Perhaps a producer will tighten and polish them for
    their full-length Mint debut, but, like with B-horror, their amateurishness doesn't eclipse their fabulousness.<p>
<li> The final song is the slow jam all zombies should woo and coo to: ""No One Has Ever Looked So Dead"". How
    could the 25th anniversary version of <i>Dawn</i> neglect this track which so inimitably befits how both of the

    ten tracks set up as a vigorous chaser to the handful of comp cuts
    and seven-inches the Boston duo had already put out on their
    Sharkattack! label.  Though the record's liner notes claim it was
    recorded intermittently between September 2001 and May 2002,
    Charlene seem oddly synched up to the early August ethos of
    right now, suggesting (with boyish, hands-in-pockets smugness)
    that we're all about to ram, unknowingly, into the beginning of
    the end-- that something stricter is poised to infringe upon
    loopy summertime bliss in big, dramatic ways.</p><p>
    
    Conceptually, it's sorta old news: the incorrigible melding of
    melody and noise, of disintegration, of static and gnashing
    feedback interrupting otherwise charming, palatable hooks. But
    Charlene's screechy intrusions are soothingly organic and deeply
    foreboding at the same time, thick with inevitability; reverb-heavy
    drums (and lots of drum machines), white noise, keyboards, guitars,
    and smooth, plaintive vocals build persistently repetitive verse/chorus
    tracks that never properly climax or transition, but keep worming
    around, making suggestions, promising things.</p><p>
    
    Muscular and sometimes heaving, Charlene's overarching sound might
    be vaguely reminiscent of the heady spin of bands like Catherine
    Wheel or the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, but Charlene's take on noise-pop
    is an oddly evasive one, and it's almost impossible to figure out
    which of the sounds here are real and which have been coyly
    synthesized-- each track unfolds like a spacey, fuzz-heavy jostle
    through a closet full of noisemakers, where everything is perfectly
    fine until, groping around in the dark, you knock something over
    and can't get it to shut the hell off.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Ripoff"" is steady and controlled, featuring dull, pounding
    beats and consistently reeling guitars that (while not exactly
    rousing) are pretty far from complacent-- their intermittently
    squealing bursts break scene well. The track finally culminates
    in a maddening drum machine hammer that doesn't age brilliantly
    from listen to listen, but still makes its point about the songs
    that follow: pretty doesn't always last very long.</p><p>
    
    ""Shot Down"" is a lit-up electronic rain, a simple, clean keyboard
    melody loping along over shaky beats and disembodied guitar whine,
    while ""Sugarblocker"" is a blurry soundscape of trilling beats and
    earnestly breathed vocals.  The half-acoustic ""Ender"" shows that
    Charlene aren't necessarily wedded to their formula: a soft,
    subdued dirge, its lush keyboard and docile guitar melody prove
    Charlene have the songwriting prowess to exist without tricks,
    that they can pull off slow-burning, sleepy sincerity in a way
    that's both tender and unexpected.</p><p>
    
    The band deserves credit for infusing a familiar formula with
    weight and tension, and for brewing a lingering unease.  It's not
    exactly a seasonal record, but <i>Charlene</i> is suffused with
    the kind of awkward, transitory disorientation that marks our
    calendar year.  Autumn inches closer.</p></div>"|1715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1715-charlene/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

Sure, it's tempting to     cop a jaded wince and react to everything with calculated disinterest, but in a world where the quiet,     seemingly emotionless among us often wind up hanging from the rafters of dank apartments, one has to wonder     how many reactions of shock and trauma are silently repressed and denied.  We're often taught not to register     our emotions, but when those unexpressed feelings finally boil over, the results are virtually <i>always</i> shocking, and it's that simmering combination of rage and terror that often fucks things up in the most     horrific ways.</p>
<p>Xiu Xiu frontman Jamie Stewart is often accused of overblown and dramatic bursts of emotion too intense and     terrifying to be considered even remotely sincere.  But as anybody who's ever experienced (or witnessed) a     full-blown emotional freakout can attest to, it's sometimes the most ridiculous and indulgent moments that     are the most wrenching and unbearable.  At their best, Xiu Xiu manage to tap directly into this kind of     unbearable tension, discomfort, and eventual catharsis, making music that's not always easy to listen to,     but that often elicits a reaction much more powerful and disturbing than almost anything else around.</p>
<p>On this EP, some of Stewart's best songs to date are pitted against the more conventional melancholia of     their Absolutely Kosher labelmates The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up.  The EP alternates between songs by the two     artists, a strategy that seriously disrupts the flow of each artists' work; compared to Xiu Xiu's unique     and confrontational contributions, The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up's songs seem tame and inconsequential.  If one     gets acclimated to the understated moodiness of the Pile-Up, Xiu Xiu's tracks tend to come across as subtle     as a punch in the face.  Taken separately, though, both groups contribute entirely worthwhile songs.</p>
<p>Xiu Xiu's four tracks-- all slated for inclusion on their next full-length-- are some of the most melodic     Stewart has ever written.  ""Fabulous Muscles"", the standout track and one of the band's best to date, features     Stewart singing over acoustic guitar, sparse percussion and plucked strings, offering a chorus of ""Cremate     me after you come on my lips.""  It's bound to strike some as gratuitously shocking, but the song itself is     in fact remarkably subtle; the percussion, though slight, is violent, musically echoing unsettling lyrics     like ""Break my face in/ Was the kindest touch you ever gave.""  Stewart's vocal performance is powerfully     nuanced as he veers from a soft, uncomfortably high croon to a barely contained wail by song's end.</p>
<p>""Little Panda McElroy"" and ""Bunny Gamer"" both make sophisticated use of electronic noises and drum machine     beats in juxtaposed order and entropy; the former is a beautiful drone piece with powerfully disturbing     undercurrents, mimicking Stewart's lyrics of self-effacing salvation.  ""Nieces Pieces"", which appeared in     a similar version on <i>Fag Patrol</i>, benefits from the cleaner sonic treatment it receives here, as it     builds to a chilling, violent-yet-skeletal finale.</p>
<p>The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up's contributions to this EP are wrenching in a much more traditional sense, employing     repetitious piano figures, whispered vocals, and simple, insistent percussion.  Over the course of two albums,     the Pile-Up have proven themselves quite adept at creating dark-yet-dynamic songs that benefit greatly from     subtle instrumental interplay and well-conceived melodies, and these four songs are no exceptions.  ""Seattle""     is the most understated and minimal of the four Pile-Up tracks, making use of a memorable piano part, but     the vocal melody seems intrinsically secondary.</p>
<p>Chris Walla produced The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up's contributions to this EP, and their ""Conversation Stalls"" bears     a striking resemblance to his full-time band, Death Cab for Cutie.  It's their best offering here, benefiting     from gorgeous, clean guitar lines and a ridiculously strong, slinky vocal melody.  ""Birthday Cake"", however,     falls into pure emo cliché, mentioning mixtapes and Nick Drake before closing with the whimpered lyric, ""I     dreamt that I kissed you.""</p>
<p>Shortcomings aside, The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up's four tracks will be a welcome addition to the collection of any     self-respecting lover of sad bastard music.  It just seems unfortunate that they have to share the bill with     a band that continually manages to lay bare the overdetermined emptiness of ""sad bastard music"" as a whole.     Both bands delve into the darker side of human emotion, but where The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up are content to     deftly tell of their feelings, Xiu Xiu lay it all out right in front of you, no matter how awkward or     uncomfortable it makes you feel.</p></div>"|8822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8822-insound-tour-support-ep/|8.4|Matt LeMay

Right there, you have a summation of the
    career of Michael Lenzi, the Chicago auteur behind Resplendent, late of the Fire Show and (in the more distant past) Number One Cup.  Lenzi adopted the pseudonym M. Resplendent
    for his time in the Fire Show, a band whose output was limited, but whose creativity seemed boundless.  In fact, it seems obvious now that they pushed their music too far too
    fast-- last year's <i>Saint the Fire Show</i> was a formidable, almost impenetrable sprawl of icy experimentalism and collapsing structure, but it was hard to imagine where they could go
    afterward, and they splintered rather than enter a cul de sac.</p><p>
    
    Now out on his own, Lenzi continues to change his music, aggressively, and this time pulls back from the brink of total abstraction, dropping a disc of...trip hop?  Well, it's not actually
    trip hop, but it operates on a similar principle, using beats and effects as a launchpad for unorthodox, but fundamentally melodic songs.  Several of the tracks he comes up with are really
    just oddball interludes, like the voices calling through a foggy electronic briar patch in the title track or the just plain jarring juxtaposition of a softly whispering voice and out of synch singing
    and piano in opener ""Wolf Chorus"".</p><p>
    
    ""Semi Hellbent Tip"" comes on like an evil Beck, with a hip hop chassis and sloppy rhyming that comes in backward and quickly reverses itself to reveal Lenzi quasi-rapping, inexplicably
    slipping into an almost British accent at times.  There's some room for debate as to whether lines like ""Mister mister/ Sister sister/ Cerebral friction givin' be a blister"" and ""who's to say
    I'm right, honky?"" are supposed to be ironic or not, but at any rate it's a truly unexpected song.  It benefits immensely from the screwy horn parts arranged by former Fire Show cohort ES
    Roth, who also scores a small coup with his trombone chart for ""Lone Vox"", a slow crawl that rumbles along on a deep, fuzzy bass part and some clockwork drumming.  There's a George
    Martin quality to the trombone bit, and it's surprising how well it fits in with the bass and cymbal sludge it's floating in.</p><p>
    
    Lenzi's vocals run quite the gamut, from the freaked out harmonies on ""Pitch &amp; Yaw""-- which closely resemble his histrionic spasms with the Fire Show-- to his low-key, gentle singing
    on ""Out on the Slicks,"" the aforementioned no-flow rapping, and the sing-speak he adopts for ""Lone Vox"", which true to its title, is the only track where he doesn't double himself.
    ""Pitch &amp; Yaw"" feels the most like a logical extension of the Fire Show, swinging between a saturated drum and sax duel, a haunting a capella passage and some
    chime-like electronics imported from ""Kid A"".  I said it when I reviewed the Fire Show's last album, and I'll mention it again here: one of the most remarkable things about this music
    is how dense it feels while employing only a few instruments at a time-- ""Pitch &amp; Yaw"" feels like it's constantly bearing down on you, even when it's just drums and vocals or vocals
    alone, calling out from inky black silence.  </p><p>
    
    Resplendent ultimately can't help being less satisfying than the Fire Show-- there's less tension and a less palpable urgency to the material-- but it's also more approachable, a relatively
    accessible introduction to the aesthetic that made the Fire Show so fascinating.  <i>In a Wilderness</i> covers an astounding array of ground in its half-hour running time, yet still holds together
    as a piece of work that once again moves Lenzi's creative boundaries in new directions.  You have to wonder what he's got in store next.</p></div>"|6892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6892-in-a-wilderness/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    In 2002, Saloon's ""Girls Are the New Boys"" finished as the Festive 50's No. 1, seeing off admittedly light competition from the UK's scmindie bands, the U.S.'s garage rock revivalists, and 
    poll perennials the Fall. That track is the highlight of the Reading, England five-piece's debut album, <i>(This Is) What We Call Progress</i>, on which Moogs and other vintage synthesizers 
    are used to create pulsating pop sounds and invite innumerable Stereolab comparisons.</p><p>
    
    On their debut, Saloon's brand of moody Krautrock is closer to Broadcast, another band oft-compared to Stereolab. Like the Birmingham quartet, there are hints of Teutonic sound, but very 
    little drone and few metronomic rhythms (the key ingredients to Stereolab's pre-Chicago work). On their second album, Saloon are slowly heading for the autobahn exit ramp-- or at least 
    riding toward France-- combining analogue synth and chugging, Neu! guitars on one track, album opener ""Vesuvias"". After that inauspicious start, it seems as if they're digging out of those 
    comparisons for much of the rest of the record, finally hitting their stride with gorgeous centerpieces ""Kaspian"" and ""Dreams Mean Nothing"". Instead of motorik and mechanical beats, it's now 
    delicate melodies, the drowsy yet mellifluous vocals of Amanda Gomez, and the occasional accents of melodica, glockenspiel, and strings that characterize Saloon's strongest efforts.</p><p>
    
    Throughout their lifetime, Saloon have always been rooted in Reading's musical Now, heading the city's ""Happy Robots"" night and serving as curators of a weekend festival of the same name 
    (a moniker also lent to one's of <i>If We Meet in the Future</i>'s weaker tracks). In some ways, Saloon is also now embracing Reading's shoegaze past. The circular guitar lines on ""The 
    Sound of Thinking"" or the bubbly instrumental passage in ""The Good Life"" wouldn't be confused with the washes of effect-laden guitar of the early 90s, but they display the textural qualities 
    of the best dream pop. It makes for a more approachable sound, offering embraceable melodies and languid sonics, but ones not sullied by an absence of personality or overemphasis 
    on virtuosity.</p><p>
    
    Happily, the concessions to the band's limited past-- ""Happy Robots,"" a Spanish-language track, the jumble-sale electronics-- are disappearing in favor of more atmospheric mid-tempo tracks, 
    often with Gomez's feathery, Harriet Wheeler-like voice dancing over low tones and shuffling drums. The further away from the 'Lab and into a more organic sound the band goes, the more 
    satisfying their music is becoming. That's not just a matter of freeing themselves from the restraints of their influences, but of honing their own strengths as well.</p></div>"|6987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6987-if-we-meet-in-the-future/|7.0|Scott Plagenhoef

    country incompatibility and perpetual misplacement. As a home, Dave Derby's America consistently fails: it's a place rife with 
    internal conflict, wide, faltering landscapes and fiery east/west oppositions; its myths don't deliver and yield startling 
    anti-climaxes.  It's American optimism gone awry, a pulsing mess of searing concrete, fickle girls, empty rooms in Manhattan, Brooklyn 
    moons, and nervous breakdowns in California.  Sometimes explicit (see Derby repeatedly cooing ""I'm just bored/ With the U.S.A,"") and 
    oddly evasive, <i>Even Further Behind</i> is Derby's big, throbbing shot at catharsis, a vehicle for lamenting the 
    impossibility of making his America work, of channeling slow, awkward detachment into a collection of soft, round pop songs.</p><p>
    
    With loads of acoustic strumming and tender backing vocals (fold in the occasional lap or pedal steel, keyboard, cello, and violin, 
    contributed by one of Derby's many collaborators), <i>Even Further Behind</i> is based-- at least musically-- on straightforward, time-
    tested folk-pop principles: opener ""Middle Class Hero"" is a jumpy, half-whispered guitar platform punctuated by tangled vocal 
    melodies, while ""Still Bored"" is a subdued, defeated meditation on apathy, Derby muttering ""If I seem removed/ Does that make it 
    OK?"" over a craggy layer of scraping guitar strings and steady, gentle percussion.  There are waves and lulls, verses and choruses, 
    rises and falls-- all the pleasant chords and perfectly keyed singing you'd expect from an earnest, confessional, guy-with-guitar 
    venture.</p><p>
    
    Derby doesn't break this formula often, but when he does creep away from singer-songwriter weeping, it's a compelling and 
    surprisingly convincing leap: ""You're My Plus One"" is a loud, two-minute distorted mess, with Derby's usually temperate vocals 
    becoming lecherous and squeaky, his previously solemn guitar-stroking going brazen and wild.  For the most part, each track on 
    <i>Even Further Behind</i> reflects Derby's itchy discord with time and place, flitting from tired to sad to temporarily pissed off--
     ""You're My Plus One"", with its fleeting in-your-face growl is the perfect embodiment of a momentary strike back, an adrenaline-
    fueled, over-before-it-started jab at the air right in front of you. </p><p>
    
    There are some trying quirks.  Derby's relentless sentimentality can become tedious (overwrought admissions, unless interrupted by a few 
    bursts of perspective or some compelling skirmishes, inevitably wane), and certain lyrics could use rethinking (""The Dream Is Over"" 
    offers the redundant ""Once I was in love with my one true love,"" while ""You're My Plus One"" has the inexplicable ""UV lights/ 
    Hydroponic entity/ Got a sonic alchemy""). Likewise, Derby's penchant for fading everything out starts to feel lazy by midway 
    through, a gooey cop-out, a quick fix for some otherwise hard-to-write endings; it's a statement of indifference, a songwriting tic 
    that starts to reflect, perhaps unintentionally, the lethargic lyrical content of his songs.  </p><p>
    
    Thom Monahan's production is evident.  <i>Even Further Behind</i> has the same lulling consistency of other Monahan-produced records-- see 
    recent work by the Pernice Brothers and Lilys-- and the record is infused with an airiness that immediately convinces you of its 
    buoyancy, lets you think it would float in water.  Still, there's a darkness skulking here, the often unspoken pressure of being mislaid and 
    disproportioned, a not-quite-definable sense of disparity that messes with things, disabling any chance at complete comfort.  Derby doesn't 
    exactly find the perfect way to isolate and translate that tension, but, somehow, it still lurks in the room, wispy and disembodied, long after 
    this record 
    ends. </p></div>"|2507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2507-even-further-behind/|7.1|Amanda Petrusich

    underground music scenes of the early 21st Century.  The chapter in question deals specifically with one of the major catalysts of the college town's re-emergence into the 
    national/international eye-- Cold Sides' self-produced EP, <i>Corrugated Sibilants</i>.</p><p>
<b>CHAPTER 3.: WARM HEARTS AND COLD SIDES</b></p><p>
    
    Long before the group reached the Rush or Journey level of excess that would plague them in their years of highest fiscal-- yet lowest artistic-- success, Cold Sides was simply a 
    rhythm-driven four piece, the phoenix from the ashes of a previous Polvo-influenced three man incarnation.  The two remaining members of that original lineup, Zeke Graves (ex-Three 
    Stigmata) and Robert Biggers (ex-White Octave), would prove to be the backbone of this fleshed out Cold Sides, set to movement by the sheer muscle of newcomers Neill Prewitt on 
    bass guitar and Dave Cantwell on drums.</p><p>
    
    Though it's difficult to separate fact from fiction-- referring to the group's Zeppelin-esque tour story involving a pound of peanut butter, one light-bulb, and an Asian-masseuse-- one thing 
    that can certainly be confirmed upon listening to <i>Corrugated Sibilants</i> is how aware the group was of their contemporaries, and conversely how eager they were to surpass them.  It would 
    be easy to find fault with the group if they had simply copied a progression of chords from obvious influences like Television, Mission of Burma or The Fall to name a few, but this 
    would be an unfair and ill informed judgment to level at a band who chose to follow in the spirit of those greats, and not in the footsteps.</p><p>
    
    ""Stretched"" begins with a deceptively upbeat guitar surge that's quickly bent over the knee of No Wave into the angular and detuned melody that follows the song until its finale.  A constant 
    and prominent bass line successfully nurtures a call and response between geminating guitars throughout the track, a sound that alternately engages both overpowering hubris and 
    fragile timidity.  The dueling sounds ultimately fall prey to the remark of the other though, leaving the sturdy rhythm to force the song forward into a quiet electric diminuendo.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps bolstered by southern-pride, and the paradoxically anti-foppish attitude of post-punk, ""Field Recorder"" was a warm gun pointed directly at nearby east-coast neighbors 
    Fugazi, and the entirety of the Dischord family.  Singing that he's ""just an instrument,"" Zeke makes more than a simple lyrical reference to the above seminal band, outfitting a 
    <i>Red Medicine</i> beat over the din of industrial drones, before a skronking James Chance sax takes the mantle with disabling atonal swarms of noise.  An example of 
    how painfully aware the quartet was of their time in aural history, the song is actually the sound of a glorious meta-music, the type that only bored ex-record clerks-- who've 
    absorbed countless hours of good music-- can produce well if at all.</p><p>
    
    Finding meaning in the space between notes, ""No Recognition"" is an exercise in extended and often homemade instrumental techniques as well as the mathy-art of the 
    stop/start.  Jading a normal pop-tune with brandished guitars, the track exhibits a jangling chorus that eventually subsides into a sparse bridge, the most vacant moment to be 
    found on the mini-album.  Eventually this empty space is taken up by humbled tones that signal the return of the dark and repetitive bass line, the portent to the track's inevitable 
    and regrettable end.</p><p>
    
    The final track ""Interiors"" endows its content with just that, as reverberating crashes and pulses establish a vast room-tone that is reinforced exponentially by the 
    across-the-room-and-phoned-in vocals of the chorus, the catchy ""ca-ca-cal-calculate interiors.""  From this, a foreign guitar line evolves becoming mated with a simple up-down 
    beat that slowly growls its way through to one last percussive thrust signaling the song's end.</p><p>
    
    A drop in the commercial and creative bucket of Cold Sides body of work, <i>Corrugated Sibilants</i> forebode the talent of what is now acknowledged to be one of the best bands to arise 
    from the 00s Chapel Hill music-scene-- with, of course, the exception being the 2009 Research Triangle Park-sponsored genetic reformation of the original-Beatles line-up 
    circa 1967.  That said, it's important to understand that interest in this EP is not founded on the notion that it captures deified brilliance or even unheralded genius, but on how well 
    it archives the sound of a band on the brink of all of that.</p><p>
    
    Though utterly enjoyable in its own right, <i>Corrugated Sibilants</i> banks on those unappreciated and valid enjoyments 
    that antedate the true prize-- such as the anticipation involved in cooking one's own food, or the feeling one gets watching a girlfriend or boyfriend get undressed before

    forces me to appreciate sincere artistic outpourings from a distance in order to more fully examine them.
    Critics have to understand and express with seemingly imagined words like ""luminous"" what listeners will
    often simply feel in terms more like ""awesome.""  We're not immune to the ""awesome"" bug, though, and we
    still discover certain records that not only disarm our battery of well-honed defenses, but raze them to
    the ground.  For TV on the Radio, all it took was Tunde Adebimpe's sterling, gospel-blues croon, a solitary
    voice multi-tracked into a gorgeous three-part harmony containing multitudes: ""Hear me hailing from inside
    and realize/ I am the conscience clear.""  A rapid, mechanized pulse of clicks lend insistence to his
    suggestion that time is short: ""We were all weaned, my dear/ Upon the same fatigue.""</p><p>
    
    A massive confluence of factors-- masterful levels, nearly too-crisp production, and David Andrew and Jason
    Sitek's beautifully translucent arrangements-- conspire to allow Adebimpe's vocals to shine, diffuse and
    radiant, as the stunning centerpiece of every track on <i>Young Liars</i>.  Bands have played up singers
    in the past, but here, the single-minded focus of every musical element seems designed purely to elevate
    the vocal melodies out of the realm of the merely ""real"" and into the hyper-real.  It's the spirituality
    and soul of the blues filtered through barbershop harmonies, but accompanied in counterpoint by dehumanized
    pulses and drones.  Without hyperbole, the effect is electrifyingly direct, nearly mesmerizing, and nothing
    quite like anything else I can recall.</p><p>
    
    Adebimpe and the Siteks are currently only playing AAA ball in the New York PR farm system, but in
    preparation for their call-up to the Big Show, it doesn't hurt that they've befriended the three-, four-
    and five-hitters in the Brooklyn All-Stars line-up: Aaron Hemphill (Liars), Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs),
    and Brian Chase (also Yeahs).  The guests make their presence known in subtle but unmistakable ways.
    Zinner's trademark, tremulant surf-waves are the vital undercurrent of ""Staring at the Sun"", while his
    low-register distortions lay the foundation of ""Blind"" in drugged-out slow motion-- atop Chase's loping
    mechanics, he creates a grim, plodding backdrop in stark contrast to the chorus' heavenly reprises,
    compellingly tarnishing the optimism of the gorgeous vocals with just a hint of uncertainty.  Adebimpe
    is plaintive and almost impossibly haunting here, but the jagged tears of Hemphill's guitar, distant
    enough to sound two studios away, sends the song blissfully over the edge.</p><p>
    
    On this disc, in which every song bears the weighty finality to close, TV on the Radio provide a surreal
    bonus track: an a cappella cover of the Pixies' ""Mr. Grieves"".  Like a streetcorner serenade, it's got all
    the oooh's, aaah's, handclaps and snaps of classic doo-wop, and yet it somehow remains brilliantly,
    unwaveringly faithful to the original.  As the song spins out its last few seconds, <i>Young Liars</i>
    ends just as it starts, with such an immediately affecting resonance for which words seem almost unfair,
    if only because the time needed to consciously process them seems a frustrating juxtaposition to the
    spontaneity of the connection to something so unique.  With this kind of sound, it's telling that TV
    on the Radio finish by covering one of the most idolized bands in independent music; it's a bold calling
    card for their upcoming full-length.</p></div>"|8196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8196-young-liars-ep/|8.9|Eric Carr

    noise-improv, it was a notable accomplishment.  However, rather than shock his audience with sonic terror, Zorn took an alternate route: he grew up.  
    His original Masada quartet was a markedly different project than he had ever been involved with before: although he'd recorded straight jazz 
    sessions (<i>News for Lulu</i>, parts of <i>The Big Gundown</i> and <i>Spillane</i>), and investigated the possibilities of Ornette Coleman's classic small group 
    methods in a modern setting (<i>Spy Vs. Spy</i>), he'd yet to really make his mark in jazz.</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, prior to a curious 1992 Naked City track on the <i>Radio</i> LP, he'd never really hinted at any relationship with Jewish music or heritage.  
    Masada was his mature statement in jazz, and his own spiritual signature-- rather than introduce complex, pre-determined compositional and 
    improvisational structures, his new band simply played.  The heads were short, often elegant; the solos cutting and fresh; the band performed as if 
    they'd been together for decades, yet always on the edge of chaos.  And like all the great jazz units, they were even better live than on record.  
    Arguably, Masada was (and is) Zorn's crowning achievement as a musician.</p><p>
    
    So, here we are, ten years later, and not much has changed.  Zorn has released a number of accomplished modern classical pieces, as well as 
    revisiting many of the areas (thrash, exotica) he'd been involved with prior to Masada, but nevertheless, since the quartet's inception, Masada has been his 
    dominant voice.  In addition to ten studio records by the band (on Japanese label DIW), his label (Tzadik, Hebrew for a ""righteous one""-- and oddly 
    enough, also having the double meaning of  ""chaos"") has presented live recordings, larger ensemble performances of the Masada material, as well as 
    housing a considerable collection of music from a ""Radical Jewish Culture"" of modern composers.  Obviously, you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy this 
    stuff, though it's clear that if you've grown weary of Zorn's MO over the last decade, you'd best sit tight: it isn't going anywhere.</p><p>
    
    To the composer's credit, he has allowed the Masada repertoire room to breathe.  As excellent as the band (also featuring Dave Douglas, Greg Cohen and Joey 
    Baron) was, sets like <i>Bar Kokhba</i> and <i>The Circle Maker</i> did wonders to keep their concept fresh.  Those releases introduced new players and arrangements 
    of songs that sounded familiar even if you'd never heard them (one criticism I have of Masada is that due to the immediately recognizable Hebrew harmonic 
    modes Zorn uses, sometimes the music can suffer from a little sameness).  To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the band, he's following up on that idea 
    with the <i>Masada Guitars</i> and <i>Voices in the Wilderness</i> CDs from earlier this year.  <i>The Unknown Masada</i> is the third in this anniversary series, and 
    features twelve different ensembles performing Zorn's pieces (all previously unreleased) in their own arrangements.  Like the previous two, and indeed 
    pretty much all the other Masada-related albums, the performances make all the difference.</p><p>
    
    The funny thing about this CD is that, despite its appeal to anyone who might be curious to hear different takes on the Masada sound, the bands that 
    invariably turn in the most interesting tracks are the ones that already have a lengthy back-history playing the stuff.  Most obvious is the 
    fantastic ""Vehuel"", arranged by trumpeter Douglas, and featuring Zorn and Cohen from the original Masada, in addition to Greg Tardy (tenor sax) and 
    powerhouse drummer Ben Perowsky.  This group performs the exotica-laden jungle-boat shuffle with force and zeal, sounding like a mini-big band.  
    Tardy and Douglas in particular knock out fantastic, high-energy solos, and the piece points to a possible new avenue for this music with larger jazz 
    groups.  Likewise, cellist Erik Friedlander (featured on several Masada releases) leads his Topaz project in a sharp, concise reading of ""Kinyan"".  
    The quartet cuts the odd-meter, angular head to shreds, and Friedlander's graceful, but kinetic solo betrays his mastery of this music.</p><p>
    
    Other performances, like Jamie Saft's raga-trance reading of ""Zarach"", or Fantomas' ""Zemaraim"" sound nothing at all like any Masada tune heretofore.  
    Saft's arrangement in particular seems almost from another scene altogether: despite making his name as one of the pre-eminent jazz organ players in 
    downtown New York, Saft's arrangement is heavy on metal guitar and sludgy, repetitive drums.  It's almost as if The Melvins dropped vocals and became a 
    communal trance-rock band, though Saft could have trimmed the length on this tune in order to sustain its impact.  UK outfit Koby Israelite offers up 
    ""Herem"", very reminiscent of the ethnic adventures on Mr. Bungle's <i>California</i>, and though the trumpet solo doesn't quite work over thrash 
    guitar it's certainly an interesting idea-- as is Tatsuya Yoshida's (Ruins) noble attempt at making one-man brutal prog out of ""Shofetim"".</p><p>
    
    Julian Kytasty's solo bandura (a traditional Russian plucked-string instrument) performance of ""Kadmut"" lends the somber piece an epic, regal 
    aura that suits its ancient, folkloric feel nicely.  Likewise, female vocalist Zahava Seewald leads a small chamber ensemble through the gorgeous, 
    practically romantic ""Shagal""-- far from an avant-garde perspective, her performance sounds of pure Sephardic folk.</p><p>
    
    Not every piece on <i>The Unknown Masada</i> will go down as a classic: violinist Eyvind Kang's ""Belimah"" starts promisingly with a chorus of majestic 
    strings, but dissolves into flat, Beatles-esque background music.  Likewise, free-jazz legend Wadada Leo Smith and percussionist Ikue Mori look like a 
    great pair on paper, but ""Demai"" comes out all electro-acoustic atmospherics and precious little to hang onto.  Nevertheless, for the most part Zorn's 
    music has yet again proved to withstand the test of time and interpretation.   If Masada does indeed go down as his greatest moment, it will be in part 
    because other musicians have run with his ideas and been able to make their own artistic marks with his music.  In that sense, <i>The Unknown Masada</i> and 
    the other anniversary series albums are as significant as any release in his canon.</p></div>"|8923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8923-the-unknown-masada/|7.4|Dominique Leone

    singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens, is that its creator was born there.  Few albums more clearly evoke
    their namesake: Towering pines, highways paved through granite walls, great lakes and deep valleys
    resonate in its gentle piano, muted trumpets, and close-mic'd production-- which is particularly odd,
    given that Stevens' home city is Detroit.  It leads you to wonder how one could craft an album so delicate
    from an inspiration its author calls a ""monstrous concrete prison"" which has been ""destroyed by its
    infidelity.""  Certainly, the album is run through with a wistful melancholia, with lyrics that reference
    the city's dead machinery and empty warehouses.  But there's a reason the album's title greets its
    listeners from the state and not the city: The record is a beautiful, sprawling homage to the
    self-described pleasant peninsula.</p><p>
    
    Fittingly, Stevens opens the record on a pensive note: ""Flint (For the Unemployed and Underpaid)"" is a
    lulling, depressive hymn comprised of dew-drop piano and a shimmering backgrounded trumpet.  Like <i>Roger
    &amp; Me</i>, the song focuses on the titular city's impaired economy and empty rust-belt factories, albeit
    with a more bathetic and singular approach than the everyman journalism of Michael Moore: Stevens softly
    sings, ""Since the first of June/ Lost my job and lost my room/ I pretend to try/ Even if I try alone.""</p><p>
    
    ""All Good Naysayers, Speak Up! Or Forever Hold Your Peace!"" follows, offering the first of only a handful
    of upbeat tunes.  Here, the pace shifts to a sound more informed by the metropolis at the opposite corner
    of Lake Michigan, echoing the tight, sophisticated arrangements of Chicago's post-rock scene.  The lengthier
    ""Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head! (Rebuild! Restore! Reconsider!)"" follows suit, also invoking a vaguely
    Sea and Cake-inspired background over which Stevens layers an extensive list of shoutouts to Michigan
    cities, as well as a warped guitar solo and nice tempo implosions.</p><p>
    
    ""For the Widows in Paradise, For the Fatherless in Ypsilanti"" is a banjo-led boy/girl bluegrass spiritual,
    dour but uplifted by the kind of sighing instrumentation Jim O'Rourke made his name on, while the strumming
    of ""Romulus"" evokes the fragile folk of Eric's Trip and Nick Drake.  Here, Stevens' pen most achingly depicts
    the everyday sadness of muted familial disruptions.  The song's narrator remembers his mother distantly:
    ""Our grandpa died in a hospital gown/ She didn't seem to care/ She smoked in her room and colored her
    hair/ I was ashamed of her.""</p><p>
    
    Equally beautiful are the sporadically placed instrumentals.  If Philip Glass wrote pop songs, they might
    sound something like these, as Stevens often uses Glass-like patterns as the foundation for his lushly
    produced, moody indie pop.  ""Tahquamenon Falls"" is what I took to be a glockenspiel clocked with a number
    of mallets and buried within a diaphanous echo of reverb; it varies and shifts slightly for over two
    minutes before trailing off upward.  ""Alanson, Crooked River"" is similar in tone, perhaps using ice cubes
    or the rims of wine glasses as instrumentation.  The mostly instrumental ""Redford (For Yia-Yia &amp; Pappou)""
    is a gently repetitious piano piece with whispered notes at the end: The human voices that resound here do
    so as isolated elements of a winter breeze, not as fully articulated words or thoughts.</p><p>
    
    If Stevens can be at all faulted on <i>Michigan</i>, it's for erring on the side of indulgence, with the
    occasional track running too long.  ""Oh God, Where Are You Now? (In Pickeral Lake? Pigeon? Marquette?
    Mackinaw?)"" drags somewhat over its nine-minute runtime, though to be fair, it does bloom icily towards
    the end.  Its sleety water crystal feel reminded me of the almost anonymous hoarfrost of mid-period,
    pre-Kinks-fixated Lilys and the vastly underrated work of the 90s D.C. indie pop band Eggs.  On the
    ebullient eight-minute ""Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head!"", the repetition works: Nowhere else on the
    album is the Philip Glass influence quite so notable, as its note patterns occur and recur, adding
    layers and resonance through chance sonic meetings.</p><p>
    
    On ""The Upper Peninsula"", Stevens harmonizes with The Danielson Famile's Megan and Elin Smith: ""I live in
    America with a pair of Payless shoes.../ I've seen my wife at the K-mart/ In strange ideas, we live apart.""
    It's this kind of sad observation of the lives of the working class that repeatedly moved me on this album,
    as Stevens offers both realism and idealization in his portrait.  The record is stacked with impressive
    space for Stevens' shimmering geography, and it manages a melancholy beauty; <i>Michigan</i> is a
    frost-bound tone poem in which average people live out their victories and defeats with a shadowy,
    dignified grace.</p></div>"|7510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7510-greetings-from-michigan-the-great-lakes-state/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

But <em>Befriended</em>, the band's seventh full-length since forming in 1986, is pretty far from the     unabashedly maudlin whining and sentimental gushes their circumstances suggest.  Floating on the crushing strength of Peris'     breathy, pitch-perfect coo, <em>Befriended</em> is a bucolic, nuanced bit of Sunday morning coffee-and-wistfulness, lovingly strummed acoustic     guitars (augmented by the occasional organ line, sparingly applied upright bass, and light, flickering drums), rolling out time-tested     chords with unwavering earnestness, revisiting the sweet, confessional early-70s folk of Joni Mitchell and the late-80s     lilt of the Sundays and Cocteau Twins.</p><p>There's an inordinate amount of walking on this record, even for the acoustic neo-folk circuit: ""Walking around New Orleans/ Looking     for a birthday cake,"" ""Now I walk for miles/ Into dark forests of piano songs,"" ""Walking through the world/ Walking under trees,"" ""We     walk the whole two miles to Holly,"" or, on the purposefully-titled ""Walking Around"", ""Walking around/ You know I've had enough     of this trouble.""  And the verb isn't being evoked, exclusively, via lyric nods: musically, <em>Befriended</em> tugs along gently, contemplative     and casual, sauntering purposefully but never building to a full-on sprint or, even, anxious trot.  Rather than wearying, <em>Befriended</em>'s     consistent tempo allows for the formulation of a strikingly cohesive record, an extended stroll through an impressionistically-     rendered New England autumn, pastoral and occasionally inspired.</p><p>""Tomorrow on the Runway"" sees Peris' sometimes childlike chirrup flitting easily from half-obscured whisper to confident bellow,     while thick layers of scraped guitar and organ pile up; the slightly less melancholic ""When Mac Was Swimming"" is a sparse, airy     piano-and-electric-guitar piece featuring a gently tapped tambourine as the sole percussive.  ""Beautiful Change"" is the     record's most dynamic cut, with Peris' vocals (here, echoing the Delgados' Emma Pollock) rising and falling dramatically over now-     familiar guitar strums.  There are certainly distinctions (both thematic and tonal) between each of the record's ten tracks, but     <em>Befriended</em> plays best as an extended rumination, a thirty-six minute, singular experience.</p>
<p>The Innocence Mission's defining characteristic is their control, and if you can get past any secret desires to tear howling through     the studio, knocking down drums and unplugging perfectly-positioned microphones, their restraint can be oddly engaging.  <em>Befriended</em> might be comforting and invitingly docile, but it's also a rich, subtly textured record, executed with impressive grace.</p></div>"|4104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4104-befriended/|7.6|Amanda Petrusich

There are two buses: one from 
    Boston to New York, the other from New York to Philadelphia. On a good day, the layover between shuttle buses only takes about an hour, just about the length of Ova Looven's debut album. 
    Those familiar with the artsy-fartsy album titles of dream-pop past might recall Antarctica's 1997 EP <i>23:03</i> or perhaps the band's equally numerical LP from 1999, <i>81:03</i>-- New York's 
    Ova Looven is Antarctica members Chris Donohue, Glenn Maryanksy, and live-show soundman Steve Depalo. National Skyline's James Minor provides guitar lines for 
    these self-proclaimed \x93electronic-shoegaze alchemists.\x94  And now together, like a comically ersatz Voltron sidelined by its underdeveloped ego, these men have combined their forces to craft 
    <i>58:34</i>, the slickly produced, affected and emotionally retarded soundtrack for my recent Chinatown layover. Here are some memories:</p><p>
<i>Minute 7:01</i><br/>
    Various trinket vendors monopolize precious sidewalk space on Canal Street, selling everything from umbrella hats to flipping elephants to remote control umbrella hats. At one stand 
    is a young boy playing with what appears to be a gold-plated Buddha statue-- it shoots a flame out of its virile member. Intrigued, I pick up another from the table and try to evoke the same flame, 
    but alas, my Buddha is broken and impotent. So, too, are Ova Looven: \x93Invisible Triangle\x94, the song of the minute, is laced with more seemingly emotional lyrics and 80s synth lines than a full season 
    of <i>Miami Vice</i> sound clips. All lines are happening at once, all the time, with nary any build up or collapse in complexity. The effect, as can be expected, is incredibly overwhelming-- kind of like 
    seeing something shoot fire out its plastic crotch. But upon closer inspection, the cheap gold paint gild of synth can no longer hide the boring song structure, and within about a half-minute, the 
    song is out of gas. Like our friend Buddha, the song has blown its load prematurely.</p><p>
<i>Minute 17:37</i><br/>
    Chinatown's side streets are home to thousands of video bootleggers; as I made a turn onto one, Ova Looven took a coincidental detour. A respite from the album's otherwise baroque 
    synth overkill, \x93All Gates Opex94 (invoking Can in name, not melody) is in a sense the only song on <i>58:34</i> where song writing seems to have come before electronic embellishment. 
    Perhaps because of my surroundings at the time, but the song seemed reminiscent of background music played behind any number of late 80s Tom Cruise love scenes, most especially 
    the one in racecar movie <i>Days of Thunder</i>, a film I bought that very day. Keep in mind that this is the highest compliment I can pay this album.</p><p>
<i>Minute 58:00</i><br/>
    As I walk by Popeye's Chicken, a truly incongruous fit in a town of dumplings and hunan steak, the vaguely feminine robot voice from the first track starts talking-- in German. Sweet. We are 
    reminded about \x93das Gedaechtnis,\x94 \x93die Höhle,\x94 and \x93der Cape,\x94 all meaningless hodge-podge which any mediocre German student can tell you is shitty electronica's equivalent to, say, prog 
    rock's fruitless musings on dungeons, dragons, labyrinths, and epic adventures. The rest of the <i>58:34</i>'s lyrics were in English, of course, making this the most pointless use of a German 
    robot voice ever. </p><p>
    It's also an unfortunate paradigm for the composition of this album: Ova Looven's musical decisions seem to defer almost entirely to superficial gimmicks akin to any mediocre 
    \x93sophisti-pop\x94 synth band from twenty years ago. Aside from the incredibly slick production which allowed for a clownish number of loops to run at all times, there is nothing that differentiates 
    Ova Looven from its New Order-aping predecessors, who similarly tried to distance themselves from their source by stuffing their songs with synth. Even New Order itself tried to build upon its 
    own foundation with <i>Republic</i> and <i>Get Ready</i>-- not by embracing more electronics, but by concentrating on the song structure itself. Maybe Ova Looven, in a fit of über-irony, 
    is parodying itself, and this is all part of some elaborate Andy Kaufmann-style joke. Whatever their intentions, I know this: it would be a goddamn ironic masterpiece if I ate at Popeye's, 
    the only non-Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Some things are just plain wrong, though.</p><p>
<i>Minute 58:34</i><br/>
    As the album fades out, I pass through an alleyway going towards East Broadway. On the roof of one building, there are about twenty or so people drinking brews and watching a movie 
    being projected onto a whitewashed wall of the building directly across from it. What a brilliant thing to do; whoever came up with that idea for a party must be the coolest, best-dressed 
    hipster on the planet. He was on Friendster seven years ago, knew about the Strokes before Fab Moretti was even born, and bought his first camouflage 
    mesh hat way before you did. What a guy. The second thing I thought was this: not even he could possibly garner enough ironic energy to enjoy this perfectly unoriginal effort.</p></div>"|6084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6084-5834/|3.0|Nicholas B. Sylvester

    guys are free to call their music whatever they want, and though it may sound like 100% lo-fi dirge to me,
    I guess the image of a deserted town is a fairly appropriate one.  The slowly shifting background textures
    (including some fascinating guitarwork by Acid Mothers Temple's Makoto Kawabata) in ""Heartbroken"" could be
    the wind creaking through some untrodden alley, just as easily as the crippled steel guitars, xylophones and
    pianos that litter the album could signify rusting cars and rotting fences.</p><p>
<i>What the Day Was Dreaming</i> (the band's fourth overall, but only the second widely available in the
    States) is frequently evocative-- the melodic bass and gently sung da-da-da's of ""Dr. Said No"" are inviting,
    the way humid night air feels when you leave an overly air-conditioned building.  Black Heart Procession's
    Pall Jenkins (who also ran the boards on this recording) contributes some spooky saw to closer ""Liam"", a
    song that spends nearly its full duration retreating from standard forms, but that still feels haunted and
    empty.</p><p>
    
    Evocative's great, of course, and it's wonderful when a band really draws you into the mood of their album,
    but a record that's all mood can wear off pretty quickly.  None of these songs present their melodies
    distinctly enough for them to make a lasting impression, which is a shame, really, because by the time
    minute #60 rolls around, they've likely lost you completely, despite any number of striking moments along
    the way.  ""Drunk &amp; Lighting Fires (A Waltz)"" feels brilliant when it's playing, an elegantly wasted guitar
    grind of funereal indie rock topped with discordant horns, but when it's over, it's really over-- the next
    song, yet another with a hanging sense of sameness and anonymous malaise, easily wipes it from memory.</p><p>
    
    Even when Maquiladora come close to developing a really good hook, like with the guitar part to ""Kiss Over"",
    it could always be sharper, and that's Maquiladora's ultimate failing.  <i>What the Day Was Dreaming</i> is
    full of arresting moments that release you just when they're about to get a confession from you, and at a
    full hour, you're almost guaranteed to take a break from it somewhere along the line.  2002's <i>Ritual of
    Hearts</i> actually did a better job of insinuating itself with the listener, and remains the album to go
    to first if you're interested.  But while Maquiladora prove themsleves able crafters of atmosphere here,
    it's going to take some more developed songs to make them anything more.</p></div>"|5100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5100-what-the-day-was-dreaming/|5.0|Joe Tangari

    Beach Boys homages, and Pete Fowler's bubbly cartoons to such a point that slipping into <i>Phantom Power</i>
    comes as a comfortable, pleasant exercise.  To some, comfortable may counted as a weakness-- for those who
    wear their bands like fashion, balling up inside Super Furry Animals' farmer-spun wool sweater won't compare
    to the Issey Miyake-esque bands peacocking down the runway in a loose web of spangles, layers of veneer, and
    sprigs of feathers. SFA are past forcing outwardly cool, past design and into craft. This is a warm album
    you'll want to hang in your closet for a damp day.</p><p>
    
    The third interior panel inside <i>Phantom Power</i>'s liner notes shows a Fowler image of a tired, collapsing
    horse in burnt oranges and blues. It's a striking tribute to the cover of the Beach Boys' overlooked
    masterpiece <i>Surf's Up</i>; instead of the slumping Geronimo, a spectral wisp winds around the mare.
    Though <i>Phantom Power</i> takes its title from the Bush-trimming chrome-plated stomper ""Out of Control""--
    in reference to both a stormy zeitgeist and the U.S. leader's simultaneously world-threatening and vaporous
    personality-- it could just as easily reflect the spirits of American legends The Byrds and the Beach Boys
    which charge the album.  This dichotomy is what makes the album so fascinating-- Super Furry Animals rail
    against the ""gulf of misery"" created by America (snowballing seas ""painted red by bleeding army""), yet more
    than ever invest their efforts in honey-dipped California harmonies, Mississippi mud slide-guitars, and
    snapping Stax drumming. The record is living testament that our nation's greatest contribution to the world
    will be our music.</p><p>
    
    Super Furry Animals never settle into one mood here, and <i>Phantom Power</i> sees the down-to-earth Welsh
    band moving away from genre-hopping and rough juxtapositions, and beginning to blend their influences into
    an evenly spread melange that simply sounds like a highly evolved pop band. The final third recalls their
    wildest forays into world and electronic music, without sounding apart from the whole. ""Valet Parking"" runs
    bossa nova down an open autobahn. ""The Undefeated"" steals enough ketamine to finish off that <i>Surf's Up</i>
    horse, melts down, and gets crunk with hillbillies in the lost Black Ark studio before bursting with horns
    and, literally, machine guns. Before long, bouncing globes of synth have sprung into sweeping strings on the
    stunning closer, ""Slow Life"", before segueing into swirling technopop and back again.</p><p>
    
    But back to the beginning: ""Liberty Belle"" sees Gruff Rhys topping himself in pure songwriting with a simply
    lovely, brilliant song about, well, everything that's happening right now. The lyrics work so wonderfully in
    repeating geographic and avian themes, as Rhys sees birds' fight-or-flight defense mechanisms in cities around
    the world-- like seagulls suddenly taking to the sky in Abu Dabai-- as a warning cry to mounting global
    trouble.  After repeatedly telling us we're ""drowning in [our] oil wells,"" Rhys relates that imagery of
    birds fleeing trees in danger to ashes rising in New York City, past ""the grimy clouds above New Jersey,
    past the kids who smoke like chimneys, to the sea."" It's the most colorful, tragic, witty, and beautiful
    passage written about 9/11. In typical SFA fashion the next song is called, rather jokingly, ""Sex, War, and
    Robots"".</p><p>
    
    Upon first listen, ""Venus &amp; Serena"" sounded like a ballad drawn from the resentment of two sisters forced by
    a conniving father from a young age to enter competitive tennis. After reading the liner notes, it turns out
    to be about a boy raised by wolves whose two closest friends were pet turtles. Go figure. But this is what
    makes Super Furry Animals so enjoyable-- you never get what you expect, and even then the results are layered
    musically, emotionally, and lyrically. This is the most richly melodic, inviting album they've recorded.</p><p>
    
    Gruff Rhys' voice doesn't have that to-the-back-of-the-arena power that so many angstful singers seem to
    rely on, which pushes him into more rewarding harmonies and melody, much like Roger McGuinn and Chris
    Hillman, who were never going to be confused with Sam Cooke, but still managed to write ""Artificial Energy""
    and ""Get to You"". Like the Beach Boys, The Byrds were an ideal collective. And with other members singing on
    ""Sex, War, and Robots"" and the b-side ""Blue Fruit"", Super Furry Animals sound that way more than ever. In
    case you still doubt the connection, <i>The Notorious Byrd Brothers</i>, to which <i>Phantom Power</i> best
    compares, also features a horse on the cover.</p><p>
    
    The mythos of the American West remains a potent signifier for nostalgia, hardship, and bloodshed. Forty
    years ago this was best exhumed with cowboy iconography. These days it can be done musically through the
    two ultimate American West pop bands, and it's what Super Furry Animals are after. If <i>Phantom Power</i>
    sounds like a tame record to your ears in comparison to the Furries' past extroverted wackiness, dig between
    the mesas to find the bones, blood, and booze.</p></div>"|7600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7600-phantom-power/|8.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

I've been listening to Depeche Mode for about
    13 years now, alternating between fandom and bemusement, and the thought had never occured to me.
    But one look at Gahan's debut solo alubm (with its unmistakable, Viradon-toned
    Anton Corbijn cover photo), and I suddenly recognized a fellow son of Israel. It's a good photograph.</p><p>
    
    One of the premier prettyboys of the 80s, Gahan looks defiantly middle-aged here-- the jowls sag a bit, the
    corners of the mouth took a mournful turn downward. He looks like he should at this point: a man with 22
    years' celebrity and six minutes of clinical death behind him. He also looks like a rather prototypical
    Jew.</p><p>
    
    Why the hell am I making a point of this? Well, it's quite indicative of the album's contents. Like many
    solo outings by career frontmen, <em>Paper Monsters is autotherapeutic: Gahan wants to share something
    about himself. It's just another level of self-mythologizing, sure, but it does yield
    interesting information-- sometimes not in the ways intended.</em></p><p>
    
    The first thing we learn is that Dave doesn't really like synthesizers all that much. The most prominently
    featured instrument on <i>Paper Monsters is, oddly enough, slide guitar. Its presence here nears
    Bonnie Raitt levels, coating most solos and even providing ambient beds. The songs
    themselves, meanwhile, are two-thirds smoothly crooned ballads over one-third lacquered rock shuffles-- all
    closer to the digi-soul of </i><i>Songs of Faith and Devotion than the IDM aspirations of
    </i><i>Exciter</i>. Fair enough: much like the Eurythmics, Depeche Mode were never a true electropop outfit. They
    were, and are, a gospel-tinged classic rock band that happened to favor au courant arrangements (as the
    legend goes, the boys switched to synths so as not to disturb neighbors during early rehearsals).</p><p>
    
    Gahan opens <i>Monstersin full masochistic mode. ""Dirty Sticky Floors"" is both the album's designated
    hit single and its most humble moment: by the end of the first verse, the protagonist is already on the
    titular floor ""praying over the porcelain throne."" After two timid ballads in a row-- ""Hold On"" and ""A
    Little Piece""-- Gahan is seized by another bout of picturesque wallowing. ""Bottle Living"" is a classic
    blues shuffle, not even transposed into a more British minor key (which ""Personal Jesus"" was). Over earnest
    guitars and low-moaning harmonica, Gahan roars ""He's living for the bottle,"" evidently recalling his own
    adventures in alcoholism from the safe remove of the third person.</i></p><p>
    
    By the next song, ""Black and Blue Again"", Dave's confessions take on a tinge of a master-and-servant
    game: Gahan might, just might, get off on self-flagellation, with the audience as the unwitting
    dominator. Regardless, there's a great middle section that finds him belting, simply, ""I'm not very nice""
    over a string crescendo. Gahan's vocal can still elevate the dumbest lyric to the level of a cathartic
    mantra, a skill that comes handy in the absence of Martin Gore.</p><p>
    
    ""Stay"" and ""I Need You"" are unfortunately not a two-part Lisa Loeb cover. The former is another
    simple, pretty ballad that brings the album's average BPM to about 90. Its chorus, once again, flirts with
    the pathetic: ""Stay/ You can leave tomorrow"" paints the singer as the whinier half of a fling. The latter
    toys with an inversion of that sentiment-- ""you'll always need me much more than I need you,"" goes the
    lyric-- but the song still ends on a note of puppy-eyed yearning. <i>Paper Monsters  succeeds
    in revealing the ""new"" Dave Gahan, and that's what makes it a faintly embarrassing listen. Whatever the
    motives, it reduces a Don Juan to begging for a pity fuck.</i></p></div>"|3623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3623-paper-monsters/|6.9|Michael Idov

    fuse.""  Pulled from the context of the poem, this line gets me thinking about things like Icarus flying too
    close to the sun or steel-driving man John Henry pounding his way through that mountain to his death.  It's
    a line about power, reach, and limitation.  I read Berman's words and imagine an aesthetic experience as an
    electrical impulse carrying so much energy that somewhere, a breaker is tripped, natural limits are exceeded,
    destruction ensues, and the resulting jumble shows the opposing forces of, well, life.</p><p>
    If I had to describe the music Christian Fennesz is making now with a single line, I could do worse than
    ""the sound of beauty blowing a fuse.""  He started off with other goals.  Early Fennesz wound a path through
    electronic abstraction and then rounded a curve around the time of the <i>Plays</i> single that led to his
    2001 release <i>Endless Summer</i>.  That record was a breakthrough that pointed the way toward a new fusion
    of guitar melody processed with the limitless textured noise made available via computer.  Listening on the
    bus home from work today, <i>Endless Summer</i> sounded even more pop than I remember; once again I was
    humming the title track, which is actually based on some pretty effective changes.  I'm told that, on his
    hard drive, Fennesz has a version of his recording of ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"" with
    Brian Wilson's vocals added on top; someone should write a vocal song to lay over ""Endless Summer"".</p><p>
<i>Live in Japan</i> documents a single show recorded in February, and it contains several chopped and
    processed segments of <i>Endless Summer</i>, but Fennesz does a lot more here than just cue tracks.  Bits
    of <i>Plus Forty Seven Degrees 56' 37"" Minus Sixteen Degrees 51' 08""</i> stream past, there's a remix in
    there along with some scattered <i>Endless Summer</i> quotes, but <i>Live in Japan</i> is Fennesz in
    freeform mode, floating from one idea the next and finding the common core of energy in his varied
    approaches.  You really could chart the emotional pitch of this set on a graph, as it begins in the middle,
    climbs to an early, intense peak, and slopes down for some quiet contemplation before starting for another
    crest.  The word ""symphonic"" comes to mind.  Japanese label Headz is billing this particular performance as
    one of the greatest laptop shows of all time.  I am not qualified to address that hyperbole, but I can say
    that <i>Live in Japan</i> is a very good Fennesz album regardless of how and where it was recorded.</p><p>
    Though the prettier aspects of Fennesz's sound appear with some regularity, <i>Live in Japan</i> generally
    leans toward noisier territory.  It's a thick, heavy mix, and there always seem to be spikes of static
    bouncing against the floating organ chords and acoustic guitar picking.  Fennesz has a way of teasing out
    unexpected sounds from his gear and creating unusual emotional effects.  About 2/3 of the way through his
    set, he constructs a mountain of drone that sounds like the orchestral sweep of Sigur Rós fused with Merzbow,
    and then, in the shadow of this monolith, he inserts a plucked guitar processed to sound like a harpsichord,
    imparting an odd medieval quality that feels completely unplugged from time.  That this towering and heroic
    mass slowly decays into the comparatively stark and desolate ""Codeine"", his remix of a track by Ekkehard
    Ehlers and Stephen Mathieu, is a testament to Fennesz's emotional reach.  He wisely concludes his set on
    this high note and breaks for a moment before plugging back in and working noisier bits of <i>Endless
    Summer</i> back into an encore.</p><p>
    Fennesz's approach with previous records has been to explore a small number of discrete sound ideas in each
    track and then assemble the varied results into an album.  A lot of the fun of <i>Live in Japan</i> comes
    from hearing how he moves from one sequence into something completely different (surely, time spent
    improvising as part of FennO'Berg was an influence here).  <i>Live in Japan</i> is mastered as one 45-minute
    track, and though I've never been crazy about this kind of listener coercion (first foisted upon the world
    with Prince's <i>Lovesexy</i>), it has forced me to consider Fennesz's set as a whole.  This record is a
    finely rendered laptop suite by a master of dynamics and pacing.  There are many people making similar
    music on their laptops at this moment, but very few are as accomplished as Christian Fennesz.</p></div>"|3032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3032-live-in-japan/|8.5|Mark Richardson

Having served as
    Depeche Mode's sole songwriter for two full decades (I know-- weird), he appears more or less content with his
    role as the band's introverted mastermind; Dave Gahan, for his part of the bargain, gets the fame and the
    occasional overdose.</p><p>
    
    Gore's modesty, as it turns out, extends to his solo outings. It just so happens that his and Gahan's
    albums came out a mere month apart, which would normally trigger reams of tedious
    comparison-and-contrast between the band's ""brain"" and its ""voice."" Luckily, <em>Counterfeit 2</em> pre-empts
    any such discussion. It's a covers album.</p><p> 
    
    That's right, the man decided to maneuver <i>around his one universally acknowledged
    talent (songwriting), instead lending his thin and dull voice to eleven compositions by the likes of Nick
    Cave, Iggy Pop and even Kurt Weill. Moreover, he's not even doing it for the first time. That ""2"" in the
    title is not there for oddity's sake-- it denotes a sequel: the first <em>Counterfeit</em>, an EP, came out
    back in 1989.</i></p><p> 
    
    This conceit is pretty disarming, you have to admit. For one thing, we can't accuse Gore of trying to sell
    records. For another, Martin's got a decent taste in other people's music. I can imagine a worse way to
    spend an hour than listening to intelligently arranged, if antiseptic, versions of ""Oh My Love"" and
    ""Candy Says"". Overall, from its (genuinely?) self-deprecating title on down, <i>Counterfeit 2
    correctly presents itself as a box of hobbyish bric-a-brac for friends and completists. It is on that
    scale that we should judge it. </i></p><p>
    
    The one big surprise here: a version of David Essex's ""Stardust"". Less a cover than a rescue
    operation, Gore's take imbues a piece of glam nonsense with sadness and gravitas. Brian Eno's ""By This River""
    sounds most like a Depeche Mode song-- circa <em>Black Celebration</em> no less-- albeit with the obligatory
    2K glitchy-twitchy production. This should shock no one, since Eno at his poppiest and DM at their most
    experimental are almost rubbing elbows (plus, he produced them.  Duh). </p><p>
    
    Those searching for the inevitable big blunder, look no further than a pastiche of Nick Cave's crude epic
    ""Loverman"". Clearly infatuated with the original, Gore forsakes reinvention for impersonation. Picture Cave's
    trademark bombast (""There's a devil crawling on your floor...Give him more/ Give him more"") and then
    imagine it issuing forth from Gore's genteel larynx. Bad idea. Needless to say, this is the longest song on
    the record, clocking in at 7:02.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, a Nico cover (""Das Lied Vom Einsamen Mddchen"") and a detour into Kurt Weill fakebook fare
    better than you would imagine: there was always a vague whiff of the cabaret about Depeche Mode. Now is
    probably the time to confess that one of my recurring adolescent fantasies was ""DM Unplugged"", with candles,
    a string quartet, a Johnny Cash cameo on ""Personal Jesus"", Gahan firmly seated in a Gothic chair, and a
    grinning Gore behind a baby grand. I still think it's a great idea. </p></div>"|3625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3625-counterfeit-2/|6.9|Michael Idov

    projects as ""porchy."" Yes, it sucks that anyone strumming on their stoop is fair game to be mocked by some
    a-hole in a Talon (""Dude! 'Every Rose Has Its Thorn'! Thass tight!'), but even <i>You Are Dignified</i>, the
    new tone-frisbee from one of the most enduring loud jumble-rock bands, reeks of, you know, screen doors and
    skeeter carcasses.</p><p>
    
    The acoustic-equals-porchiness stigma is, reckon, a result of the weird arc fabricated
    by the prominence of Harry Smith's <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>, an arc that runs through Guthrie's
    populist sloganry, through Dylan's self-consciously throwbackian <i>Basement Tapes</i>, and through the work
    of sundry ensembles with either ""Brothers"" or ""Family"" in their name (Palace, Pernice, Radar, Danielson,
    Handsome, etc.). Rather than cover a bunch of traditionals, or garnish modern classics as Crooked Fingers
    did on <i>Reservoir Songs</i>, Silkworm's divaless trio descended into Tim Midgett's basement and belted out
    five tracks by their pals (two by their Touch and Go labelmates, the canny synergists; students of balneology
    will find a whole lot of backside-washing going on).</p><p>
    
    Given the tiki treatment, Shellac's ""Prayer to God"", that almost inhumane chestnut about double homicide
    (""Just kill him/ Fucking kill him/ Kill him already, kill him"") fits perfectly into the lineage of country
    death songs rooted in that Smithsonian thing (especially volume four, on Revenant Records), leaving a
    bloodtrail through Johnny Cash's catalog, through the Violent Femmes' overt ""Country Death Song"", through
    Will Oldham's eerie (Albini-recorded) ""A Sucker's Evening (""I'll hold his arms, you fuck him/ Fuck him with
    something/ The fuck... he deserves it""). Fans of these murder ballads should consult Robert Browning's
    chilling (and ahem, Monsieur Farrar, songworthy) poem ""Porphyria's Lover"", in which the killer holds his
    strangled woman in his lap, marveling at how ""God has not said a word."" Wait, Farrar already did the old
    standby ""Lilli Schull"" (""She begged me not to kill her,"" ""The fire where I burned her"").</p><p>
    
    ""And Then"" was a prototype B-side version of Pavement's ""The Hexx"", from their swan miscarriage <i>Terror
    Twilight</i> (Silkworm's cover was previously released on the Pave tribute <i>Everything Is Ending Here</i>).
    The 'Worm deserves kudos for lending a rugged staidness to the song that even sincere-mode Malkmus can't
    muster. This track wanders as close to GnR's ""Patience"" as this EP dares; dig Andy Cohen's accomplished,
    plangent mandolin stylings (though he plays it much more Malkmusly at the end of this disc).</p><p>
    
    Your enjoyment of the Bedhead reworking (of the Albini-recorded ""Lepidoptera"") might teeter on your appraisal
    of Bedhead (Mine? They're overrated and their best recording is their cover of Cher's ""Believe""). Interestingly,
    Silkworm force the original's buried vox to the forefront, over an arrangement that at times almost falls
    silent (remember, this is a band whose electric solos often sound like by-products of dares). Shame the
    lyrics are hit-and-miss-and-miss, but the mandolin breakdown will soothe those still mourning Lullaby for
    the Working Class's metamorphosis into Mayday, of Emomaha's Saddle Creek imprint.</p><p>
    
    Albini client Robbie Fulks' ""Let's Kill Saturday Night"" is a catchy down-and-out rabble-rouser that transcends
    all John Bon Cougar Jovi-Mellencamp wannabes, and Silkworm was wise to strip the ""rock"" version to its tuneful,
    flannel-flag-waving essentials, but come on, these ""lousy job"" anthems could be generated by a computer
    program (call it Cracker). Cohen's mandolin rules this EP's rendition of Nina Nastasia's (yup, Albini-recorded)
    ""That's All There Is"", seducing the song out of its stolid sparsity and onto a rickety, candle-stained (I'm
    sorry) porch.</p><p>
    
    This EP succeeds as an insidery, and even loving, toss-off, but leaves one half-wishing for a new song, or a
    bare-assed treatment of a Silkworm classic, or at least some drums. Completists should pursue their cover of

    the phrase ""Verbena grunge"" does yield 450 results (make that 451).  But that's bound to happen when you record an album with Dave Grohl, and every Foo Fighters interview circa 
    Verbena's last album (<i>In the Pink</i>) proved Dave all too willing to invoke the mystique and grandeur of a Mr. Cobain in describing Bondy's particular musical talents.</p><p>
    Verbena doesn't do themselves any favors by leading off this album with a referential riff-fest that mimics the current grunge torchbearers, Queen of the Stone Age.  Over a confluence 
    of sturm and drang highly reminiscent of <i>Songs For the Deaf</i>'s opening salvo, Bondy drawls and preens through a minefield of klutzy nods to various bands (""Let the good times 
    roll/ Down in my rabbit hole/ I've got my Mexican radio/ Me and my rubber soul""-- see also the 2nd verse's mention of a ""19th nervous breakdown"").  Even the title (""Way Out West"") offers 
    a not-so-sly wink towards the rock canon-- it happens to also be the title to a Big Star song.  Despite the dubious and derivative nature of this track, it manages to make itself enjoyable 
    enough: if you're able to listen to it  with virgin ears, untainted by a priori musical knowledge, all the better.  If only the rest of the album were this eager to please.</p><p>
    Instead, the majority of <i>La Musica Negra</i> would have listeners believe Verbena is forgoing the flannel, flange,  and pop-friendly self-flagellation of the 1990s for a dive into the gloriously 
    murky and muddied waters that birthed the stuff of Seattle's musical infamy-- Jimi Hendrix in the red house, CCR sailing the green river on the Proud Mary, Black Sabbath's snowblind 
    paranoia.  Yeah, I know I forgot to include the garage rock &amp; punk rock influences as part of what made the Melvins and Mudhoney and the better-known Washington State exports worth 
    remembering.  Thing is, Verbena forgot, too.</p><p>
    Starting with ""Killing Floor (Get Down On It)"", and continuing on until the next to last track (""Rememberer""), Verbena plod down an irredeemable path that finds the group doing their best to 
    bore the pants off us with super-produced, blues-infected sprawl (and by ""blues"" I mean the cream of the crap that contemporaries and disciples of Stevie Ray 
    Vaughn have foisted onto the listening public-- a little stiff shuffle, a little staggered swagger, a lot of mousy mewling).  Bondy's particular mewling vaguely recalls the shredded pipes of 
    hard rock stickmen like the Black Crowes' Chris Robinson (AKA He Who Would Be Otis Redding) and Buckcherry's Josh Todd (AKA He Who Would Be Chris Robinson), albeit without 
    the power and propensity to shriek.  However, in trying to sound tough and dangerous and drunker than drunk (like any hard rockin' singer dood should, duh), he comes off as bored and 
    listless.  In one instance (""I, Pistol""), Bondy's threat ""never mess with me"" brings to mind the lackadaisical mumbling of Oasis' Liam Gallagher.   Sometimes they're fast (""It's Alright, It's 
    Okay""), sometimes they're slow (""Camellia"", ""Ether""), but without a doubt, they're consistently interminable. </p><p>
    As if this half-ass bastardization isn't enough, the lyrics kick it to another level of absurdity by dropping Jesus, his pop and the bad guy often enough that one might think the 
    Catholic church are shilling a nice chunk of change Verbena's way for all this free press.  It's as if the group thinks that giving lip to the man upstairs might grab them some face time with 
    Mr. Satan at the crossroads for a chance to get some of the stuff Robert Johnson got.  Sprinkled on top of this crusty confection are song titles that crib from porn flicks (""Devil in Miss 
    Jones""), indie flicks (""It's Allright, It's Okay (Jesus Told Me So)""-- a line prominently featured in <i>American Movie: The Making of Northwestern</i>-- and good old punk zines (""Me and Yr Sister"", 
    ""White Grrls"") to add a little unearned counter-culture flavor to these bland proceedings.  Verbena even includes a bit of Kurt Cobain vocal idolatry in ""Rememberer"", just so folks can 
    remember the very thing Verbena wants them to forget.  Producer Rob Schnapf (renowned knob-twiddler on bright &amp; shiny albums from Elliot Smith, Guided By Voices and Beck) does 
    a fine job of giving this slop a modern rock sheen-- check out the fierce introduction to ""It's Alright, It's Okay""-- but tying a pretty bow on a pig doesn't keep the damn thing out of the mud.</p><p>
    To make themselves look even worse, Verbena closes the album with ""Dirty Goodbyes"", a gentle ballad featuring brushed drums, piano, and Bondy singing in an 
    unaffected, casual fashion.  The addition of doubled vocals and theremin are an obtrusive reminder of the album's ""professional"" production values, but this track still outshines 
    everything else on this record by a wide margin.  It offers tantalizing hints of what could have been were the band not dead set on coughing up a collection of brittle, craggy debris and 
    passing it off as ""rock music.""</p></div>"|8446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8446-la-musica-negra/|3.6|David Raposa

    collaborate fitfully on the splattered Fluxus games of chance they've disguised as deconstructed western sludge. Already the subject of 
    feature-length documentary bearing the band's name, the trio's substantial conceptual baggage could be a plus or a minus, depending on how many guffaws 
    you enjoy with your guitar solos.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, some of their exercises are interesting. For one, Rudy Bloody, Wizard 333, and Cunt avoid playing shows in clubs; instead, they break down 
    the touring system and kick-it sweaty and suffocated through multi-hued stoner rock in parking lots, crammed into a smokey Volkswagen van. And in 
    2001-- cribbing from the <i>Oulipo Compendium</i>-- they attempted to record 300 non-repetitive LPs of at least 30-minutes over one year; they shot 
    themselves in the foot when deciding to disallow jamming and only managed to spit out 137 full-lengths, one of which includes the twelve-tone-friendly 
    ""Schoenberg Study in Metal"".</p><p>
    
    Following this trajectory, <i>Killball</i>-- the band's first full-length for Load-- is another concept piece and quite lovingly dedicated to the Denver Broncos: 
    ""Killball details an ultra-violent future where games are played to the death. Killball is similar to American football circa 1920-2016, except the 
    players wear no pads and are given PCP to ensure a grizzly game. Each player is equipped with a switchblade and a machete. To be tackled is to be 
    destroyed."" More Beavis than Baldessari, more Butthead than Beuys, the twelve screeching tidbits on <i>Killball</i> act out just such a game, 
    and the resultant 27 minutes and 55 seconds sound akin to American Gladiators cast members caressing the asses of the very confused Melvins, who find 
    themselves acting as beguiling heavy-metal cheerleaders.</p><p>
    
    Dealing in husky noise similar to that of Harry Pussy or Crank Sturgeon, but with the ha-ha gag reflex of Happy Flowers and <i>GodWeenSatan</i>-era Ween, the 
    tone's set from the opener, ""Carnisaur Vs. Unicorn"". In its 1 minute and 11 seconds the Carnisaur is hyped-up as being like steel, while the Unicorn 
    receive props through brassy shouts of ""unicorn power."" The track itself is basically a low fidelity take on the obnoxious  ""Are You Ready For Some 
    Football?"" warm-up you half-watch prior to televised NFL games. And then the games begin:</p><p>
    
    The second track, ""Win"" has repetitious bass, synth, drums, and lots of cymbals:  The Fucking Champs playing along to Dire Straits' ""Walk of Life"" 
    video with swirls of Devo chucked throughout. ""Linebacker Blitz"" opens with shouts of ""go go go go"" and is less like a blitz, more like a drum circle of 
    zombies referees whistle and loud spectators popping and locking with an  ""ooh"" and an ""ah."" Perhaps they're doing squat thrusts? Regardless, it 
    reminded me of the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. There's a shift at the end, too, which brings about more shouting and something that sounds 
    like a group of people tackling a microphone. A stronger track, ""3 Peat (March to the Locker Room)"" has lots of fast drums that stop quickly like, 
    *wince*, Anal Cunt, until guitars feedback and take themselves apart. Here, bass and drums creep along like robots while guitars act as descending fireworks 
    or adrenaline leakage. The big tonal switch on <i>Killball</i> comes with ""Halftime Band""; here the crowd goes crazy for the wacky band's out-of-tune 
    horns and whistle. It's glue-sniffing goodness, a sodden march reminiscent of off-kilter appropriation of popular songs by King Frog and Weird Al.</p><p>
    
    That's just a portion of the first half. The second brings us what sounds like King Diamond leading a wave, a song for John Elway, crippled Monster 
    Magnet, people shouting about yardage, a Clinic-like two minute warning complete with vocal feedback and missile launchers, and the approximation of 
    sonic PCP. The last track, ""Winners"" features fans pealing-out ""yeah, yeah, woo, woo, yeah""  between speakers, making the stereo peak-out. So, yeah, the 
    narrative's not much; though it for real made me want to go check out a young and suave Burt Reynolds in <i>The Longest Yard</i>.</p><p>
    
    Adept at twisting interesting layers of sound and choking out some fervid polyrhythms, Friends Forever could perhaps one day exist nicely outside of 
    the silliness, but for now the band seems pretty unrepentant about affixing a punch line to just about every saturated moment. Unfortunately this 
    particular theme got a bit grating before the work turned into anything substantial.</p></div>"|3264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3264-killball/|5.8|Brandon Stosuy

    TM's cover of ""There is a Light that Never Goes Out"": chilled-out bedroom types working in the idiom of abstract electronics (i.e., patching and processing beats and samples 
    on their computers), but writing songs like sappy indie kids (i.e., with shy vocals, sleepy melodies, and ""real"" instruments). The closest thing to a nametag, ""laptop folk,"" seems 
    left over from the critical orgy around Mum, and it's far more evocative than accurate.</p><p>
    The fact that no one's pushed to define this stuff as a coherent genre doesn't surprise me. For the most part, the trend feels too natural to turn into an event; it's been bound to 
    happen since the first day IDM albums started sharing CD-changer space with indie bands-- or even earlier, when post-rave and ""post-rock"" came thinkily together with bands like 
    Seefeel and Disco Inferno. It's also too broad: the artists may be connected by the processes they employ or the labels they record on-- Germany's Morr Music chief among 
    them-- but their backgrounds, intentions, and the range of their results seem wildly varied, bordering on rock, pop, dance music, and abstract electronica on so many fronts that it 
    seems silly deciding who ""counts."" Writing studious pop songs with computers? That needs a name?</p><p>
    Add to that the big secret-- that a lot of this stuff has just been too obvious, or too boring, to deserve a tag. A lot of it, in fact, sounds suspiciously like the same old indie songs with 
    some timid IDM sequencing running behind them. Styrofoam's decentish <i>I'm What's There to Show that Something's Missing</i>, for instance, sounds like a bunch of Ida songs done 
    over all click-and-pingy: not nearly a bad idea-- fans of the Postal Service will like it-- but not exactly a surprise, either.</p><p>
    If the standard name-drops in this field were anything like Tujiko Noriko, it'd feel a lot more like a notable development-- only we'd never start dreaming of a genre, because
    they'd all be far too idiosyncratic. Noriko, you see, is near-religiously fascinating and spell-casting, even when she's treading the line on boring; compared to a lot of those 
    studious-looking Europeans, Noriko's work is remarkably disconnected from the usual approaches to laptop software and pop songwriting. Where people like Styrofoam make 
    music that's pretty exactly the sum of its parts, Noriko mostly sounds like she's using different parts altogether, and the result feels like something Björk might hear in one of her 
    druggier dreams.</p><p>
    It's a strange image she draws forth, even more so on <i>From Tokyo to Naiagara</i> than on her first full-length, <i>Make Me Hard</i>, released by Mego, a label mercilessly 
    dedicated to the glitchiest of glitch experimentalism.  This record has her moving to the pop-friendlier Tomlab, and doing some deglitching in the process.  The mental 
    picture isn't of a bald-headed guy leaning intently over his laptop; Noriko's sine-wave musicality feels more like someone sitting down at a piano to let loose a starry-eyed sob of 
    a song (and she does, indeed, seem to be playing a lot of organ around her squelchy sine-wave bumps and whirs). <i>From Tokyo to Naiagara</i> is all about that type of real-life real-room 
    hush and stillness, the same feeling as paying careful attention to your breathing: the songs unfold slowly from the most abstracted of places, taking shape serenely around Noriko's 
    heavy sighs.</p><p>
    It's that voice, and its inextricable relationship with the songwriting, that are the keys here. Noriko's remarkably clear, unprocessed singing-- its soul croons and brief pronouncements, 
    and the almost discordantly close harmonies she wraps them into-- seems, at first, almost aimless, the melodies winding around too subtly and complexly for a single melody to 
    stick in your head after it's passed. Sometimes this is actually the bad thing it sounds like-- ""Tokyo Tower"" doesn't move any more than the real thing-- but more often it's just an 
    amazing drifting preface to liftoff: not unlike Thom Yorke's wandering moans for Radiohead, the lines all eventually rise and converge into a big oceanic exhalation.</p><p>
    It'd take a lot of these runs over the climax of ""Pyramid Song"" any day. See ""Rocket Hanabi"", where a bursting drum loop, superlow bass booms, and dream-state organ fizz all gather 
    up into one of the record's many sky-sized swoons; it's what I imagine it would sound like if Boards of Canada teamed up with Nivea, or at least Miho Hatori. See ""Tokyo"", where 
    an almost rhythmless abstraction of mismatched hissess and clunks arranges itself into a dubby slink (what I imagine it would sound like if... Autechre teamed up with 
    Tweet? Nevermind). See ""Kiminotameni"", then, the most traditionally-constructed of the bunch, which takes a simple bass pulse and airy hums to wash out and watercolor a sleepy-dream 
    echo of synth-pop; see the big swoon on ""Zipper"", which trips out like a de-growled Bjork before unleashing a total shivering killer of a ""la-la-la"" backup.</p><p>
    It's all very heavy-lidded-- your head bobbing in aquatically-slow motion-- and it offers little in the way of things like chord progressions and melodic developments, opting instead 
    for the grammar of floaty tones and buzzy tweaks assembling themselves and cresting upward.  It's easy to get lost, disoriented, and yes, for many, possibly bored, but all this is 
    just gorgeous, and not in any cute-and-pretty way: Noriko just might be sobbing and wailing. I would say it's worth the trouble of working your way inside this little world and finding 
    your way around, but getting inside isn't trouble at all: it's lovely.</p></div>"|5835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5835-from-tokyo-to-naiagara/|8.3|Nitsuh Abebe

You know how it goes: you pick up a record, give it a few spins, run 
    out to tell all your friends about it, and BAM!  ""Dude, wake up, nobody listens to that anymore.""  Apparently the only crime worse than listening to 
    out-of-date shit is not realizing it's out of date.  For non-hipsters, it can be pretty confusing, especially in fields of music (like 
    electronica) that tend to move through ""periods"" quickly; it's often hard to tell when an artist or genre has truly passed their peak, or is merely the 
    scapegoat for the newest sound, made to appear passé, when in fact they may not have even broken through to many people in the first place.</p><p>
    Needless to say, very little of this has to do with the quality of the actual music-- you've probably been the recipient of more than one 
    misleading recommendation wherein the criteria seemed to be based on little more than the sparkling shine of new product.  In IDM, over the past couple of 
    years, some people might argue the opposite is happening: good music is being trampled upon for no better reason than the changing of the seasons.  This 
    phenomena is hardly unique to music, or even art, but does make it harder to spread the word about cool tunes.</p><p>
    London's \xB5-Ziq (Mike Paradinas) has done his share to advance the cause of electronic dance (or otherwise) music since his 1993 debut <i>Tango N' Vectif</i> 
    and astounding follow-up <i>Bluff Limbo</i>, both released on Grant Wilson-Claridge and Richard D. James (aka Aphex Twin)'s Rephlex label.  As one of the 
    first of a group of musicians (also including Aphex, Seefeel and later, Squarepusher) incorporating experimental touches into straight-up jungle and techno, 
    Paradinas has never been afraid to step out of the box.  He further proved this on 1994's remix project with The Auteurs, wherein his results bore little 
    resemblance to the English indie-poppers' originals.  <i>Lunatic Harness</i> (1997) is usually brought up as his best release, and is arguably his first to really nail 
    the synthesis of straight drum n' bass, experimental ambient and a kind of future-pop that relied as much on deft, tricky synth lines as it did samples.  
    <i>Bilious Paths</i> expands on this formula, even if it doesn't drop anything drastically new.</p><p>
    If you're looking for a fresh start on <i>Bilious Paths</i>, by all means skip the first couple of tracks.  ""Johnny Mastricht"" is hyperactive, 
    completely saturated jungle: the template hasn't really changed much in almost a decade, but as \xB5-Ziq is one of the people who pushed it into 
    more adventurous realms than mere breakbeats, he's entitled to dwell.  ""Johnny Mastricht"" has a lot more going on (check those telephone samples 
    and the myriad of synth lines) than Paradinas' earliest stuff, and if you're just needing a noisy jam fix, it has you covered.  ""Meinheld"" cuts to the 
    chase: imagine drum 'n bass translated as ""drum solo with ornamental coloring.""  There are some nifty, faux-<i>Apocalypse Now</i> synth textures here, 
    but the real show is clearly the artist's way with a break.  He puts on an impressive display, but if you're wanting him to reinvent the wheel, you may want to 
    look elsewhere.</p><p>
    For me, the highlights are the points where Paradinas either steps away from his table of 1000 breaks, or manages to obscure his moves well enough that 
    it's more fun to let it blast than dissect the drum tracks.  ""Siege of Antioch"" begins as a chirpy computer crash, but soon explodes into a 
    cyclical lightning strike synth line, under which his bass drum does considerable damage.  Shards of jagged metal bounce from one side of my 
    stereo to the other, and for a moment I'm distracted enough not to notice he's injected a solemn chord cluster in the background.  For a time, the 
    song goes by in two keys at once-- disorientating, but of a pretty fascinating position to be caught in the middle.  ""AEC Merlin"" keeps the 
    off-center effect, but this time it's closer to nausea: the BPM is still up there, but \xB5-Ziq does a nice job of keeping things calm (if queasy) with a 
    masterful, gray-toned synth line-- the kind that Autechre gave up on a few years ago (and BoC took to the bank). It's just able to tie together 
    the otherwise jittery, chaotic beats.  Of course, he has those covered as well on ""Grape Nut Beats, pt. 1"", going out to all the epileptics he's loved 
    before.</p><p>
    And yes, there are some downers here (especially the entirely goofy, nerd-hop of ""On/Off""); <i>Bilious Paths</i> is probably not a record that's going 
    to hold off a movement against IDM, but it is certainly not without its merits.  It's nothing shocking for \xB5-Ziq fans I guess, and it would be hard to 
    argue he hasn't beefed up his sound over the years.  The best parts of the record are as cool as anything else going on in my listening room recently, 
    and in the end, that's probably as good a recommendation as I could give you.</p></div>"|8326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8326-bilious-paths/|7.9|Dominique Leone

In science, one controls variables and conducts an experiment in order to     test a hypothesis. Most experimental music doesn't really fit the bill. Experimental music is usually not an attempt to discover whether a specific     idea holds true under a given set of conditions; what we call ""experiment"" in music might better be described as ""tinkering.""</p>
<p>Tinkering is a meandering stream of connected thoughts and movements that might lead to invention: ""Okay now, what happens if I put this here, yes, I     see, then I tighten this screw and wait, that doesn't work, I need to put the screw underneath this fold, okay, that ought to do it. Now I make a cut     here..."" Tinkering is what Thomas Edison was doing when he first sat at his workbench and wrapped tin around a cylinder to see if he might make cuts     into the metal analogous to sounds in the air.</p>
<p>Tinkering is the perfect word to describe this collaboration between Christian Fennesz and Vienna-based improv group Polwechsel. Polwechsel's MO     is to create texture and reveal the inner-workings of sound itself.  Accordingly, there is virtually no melody on <i>Wrapped Islands</i> and instruments     throughout are not used in the traditional manner. Instead we get a series of drones, scrapes, brushes, taps, rustles. There is the sound of John     Butcher's saxophone, but usually he blows a single note for 30 seconds and then repeats, transforming his Western instrument into a Fourth World     didgeridoo. The guitars, including some of Fennesz' trademark processed strums, drift through a seemingly unrelated series of notes chosen for their     geometry, with the occasional jazzy upstroke to keep a foot in the world of conventional music. A cello might be sawed or plucked or tapped or just     banged around a bit to hear what happens.</p>
<p>The members of Polwechsel play established instruments but two of the members (and Fennesz) are also credited with ""computer,"" and other with     ""electronics,"" so you know anything goes as far as sound. Still, the feel of <i>Wrapped Islands</i> is very live and in-the-moment. It's an album of quiet,     subtle, low-key improv, music that rumbles and creaks like a building settling into place after a tremor, with just a hint of tense soundtrack     music providing atmosphere in the background.</p>
<p>There is space in most of these tracks, a thousand holes of silence poked into the chattering web of sound, but my favorites have more density.     <i>Wrapped Islands</i> is at its best when the drones gather some momentum. On ""Framing 3"" (the tracks are titled Framing 1 through Framing 8), a bony     spine of drone, something like the gurgle of an outboard boat engine, snakes through the track giving the typically random sounds something to bounce off     of. When Butcher's tenor enters for a three-note phrase, the most typically jazz-sounding bit on the entire album, the contrast in the tension is     palpable. ""Framing 5"" is also thick and heavy, with gurgling keyboards and deep bass plucks suggesting some kind of threat.</p>
<p>A distant, vague sense that something is wrong prevais on <i>Wrapped Islands</i>, and the tone varies little from track to track. There are     moments when something lighter pops out, as on ""Framing 4"" begins with one of the few concessions to beauty, with a graceful low-end flutter, sterile     but mechanically lovely, but these vanish rather quickly into the dark, serious atmosphere of the group improvisation. This devotion to a small     handful of moods suggests that Polwechsel and Fennesz had something specific in mind when they sat down together to tinker, but my sense is that they     never quite found what they were looking for. <i>Wrapped Islands</i> seems a bit like scribbled notes in pursuit of a potentially great invention.</p></div>"|6392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6392-wrapped-islands/|6.8|Mark Richardson

    head, and spill his wild theories-- sex is violence!  Jesus enjoyed a good menage-a-trois every now and again!
    You can piss in the shower!  On yourself!-- and fantasies about the mountains and deserts he'd probably never
    seen.  If you drove in from the 'burbs and met this guy, he'd tell you things you'd never imagined-- but
    the whole time, he just wanted your money.</p><p>
    The three albums that Jane's Addiction cut, from their commercial breakthrough in '88 to their sudden
    breakup in '91, placed them solidly as one of the great bands of their time.  Farrell partnered with star
    lead guitarist Dave Navarro-- a fellow metal drama queen-- and the stellar rhythm section of Stephen Perkins
    on drums and bassist Eric Avery: you could send them out on reconnaissance and know they'd come back.  Not
    only did the band help start the ""alternative rock"" era and revive great hard rock on the major labels, but
    their fusion of metal, goth, punk-funk-grooves and art-rock showed a breadth and power close to none other
    than Led Zeppelin-- a band whose greatness they scraped with their artistic and commercial pinnacle,
    <i>Ritual de lo Habitual</i>.</p><p>
    And then it was over.  Without dwelling on every solo project and spinoff band, you can argue that each new
    album was safer and duller than the one before.  Farrell's Porno for Pyros made him tame and serviceable,
    as the one-time street threat became the professional concert promoter behind Lollapalooza.  With his
    exotic electronica record <i>Songs Yet to Be Sung</i>, he'd finally made it out to the desert, even if he
    was too straight and cleaned-up to make anything of it.  The others didn't fare much better, but aside from
    a one-off reunion tour (with Flea on bass), the band had been inactive for over a decade when they got back
    together-- with Chris Chaney replacing Avery-- to record <i>Strays</i> and revive Lollapalooza, which
    they're currently headlining.  Again.</p><p>
    If you're an old fan you might stop cold when you hear the band's new sound.  I'll just be direct here:
    Jane's Addiction have embraced the stainless steel of nu-metal.  That said, the old band is recognizable--
    Farrell even shouts ""HERE WE GO!"" to kick it off-- but now they're tight, clean and less dynamic; some
    tracks sound slick enough to fit in a movie about street-racing sports cars.  And who thought Farrell's
    voice would fit the bold, basic hard rock of the single ""Just Because""?</p><p>
    But let's assume none of that bugs you. They went modern, and sometimes they sound like the music your
    little brother listens to because he's still scared of your records-- but they still knock aside pretty much
    anything else on commercial rock radio today.  The performances are ferocious.  Farrell sounds completely
    committed, pushing more out of his voice than you'd think it could give him.  Navarro's leads fly by so
    often he barely pauses to point them out.  Producer Bob Ezrin (Kiss, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd) deserves
    credit for catching (or generating) all the excitement in this date, even if the perfection is unnatural:
    the finishing touches are immaculate, from the light use of keyboards to the occasional choir and horn
    section, all layered barely above the surface. </p><p>
    ""Hypersonic"" is a dizzyingly tight piece of metalcraft that screeches to a giddy finish; ""True Nature"" and ""Wrong Girl"" echo the segues and moody sections of past Jane's tunes, while
    ""Superhero"", the most cussing (and probably my favorite) song, acts as traditional mid-album sass-swagger, with its catchiest hooks.  They sequenced the most
    creative songs around the clichéd hard rock of ""Price I Pay"" and ""To Match The Sun"", but unfortunately, the album's strengths stop at its construction.  <i>Strays</i>
    lacks what what made the band great in the first place: believable songs and lyrics.  According to interviews, the band wrote this material in the studio, so it's not surprising that
    none of the songs sound like they were burning to be written-- or remembered.</p><p>
    The chorus of ""Superhero"" and the Zep-riffs of ""Wrong Girl"" don't excuse the forgettable hooks and by-the-numbers hard rock that fill most of the record.  The problem isn't that they didn't
    write a new ""Jane Says"", it's that none of these songs can touch <i>any</i> of the material from the first three records.  The dynamics-- the bass-led segues and sudden avalanches of sound,
    the hooks and stylistic extremes-- are simply absent.  <i>Strays</i> boasts the band's career-worst dog, the ballad ""Everybody's Friend"", with an acoustic guitar part that <i>won't</i> be played in dorm
    rooms across America, and groaner lines like: ""Men of peace/ Men of war/ Tell me, who knows more?""  And that's more colorful than the kitchen magnet verse on the other songs. Still, as
    if knowing this, Farrell whizzes through and preferentially emphasizes the timbre of his voice over what he's saying: the lyrics have gotten wordier, yet none of them sound like they matter.</p><p>
    It's hard to go from the songs on <i>Ritual</i> that seemed torn from Farrell's guts to this one-dimensional writing, but to be fair, those comparisons ignore that twelve years have passed.
    Farrell's not the man he was-- and nobody wants to hear a fortysomething sing about living clean and studying the Torah.  He's in a different life: he's done letting us live vicariously through his
    mania.  Judging from <i>Strays</i>, he and the band aren't out to add to the significance of their earlier work; they take the momentous quality of their reunion momentum and aim for the ages.
    At least they want to rock.  For a reunion cash-in, that's saying a lot.</p></div>"|4203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4203-strays/|5.8|Chris Dahlen

    not deserving of too much contemplation. But now I'm holding a copy of a CD by Guther, slick and shiny and waiting for the trash can, and I think I might just understand. 
    And I'm hoping that <i>I Know You Know</i> is just one end of the no doubt vast spectrum of ""twee"" music-- the half-assed-attempt-to-sound-like-Belle-and-Sebastian-without-
    actually-being-very-good end.</p><p>
    
    Aside from constructing a vapid time trap, languishing in the blue-tinged world of <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>, where cute teen actors are replaced by 
    sour-faced indie kids with moptops and sweatbanded wrists, Guther seem to have spent their time perfecting just one song. And instead of filling up their notebooks with extra material-- 
    just in case that one perfect tune isn't really as perfect as they'd hoped-- they decide to mix 9 variations on it and call it an album. If their intent is for <i>I Know You 
    Know</i> to function as the shopping soundtrack for The Gap or Buckle, or that flagship of trust-fund suburban style Abercrombie and Fitch, then I can't talk shit, because that mission has been 
    accomplished. You could browse the sale racks for pre-ripped cargo shorts and stressed AE t-shirts till your knees gave out and think you were listening to track one, ""The Other Day"" 
    the entire time. There is so little variation in mood and tempo from song to song, you wonder why masterer Stefan Betke inserted the 2 seconds of silence between ""Taglieben"" and 
    the equally wispy ""Trouble You Cause"".</p><p>
    
    Coy and passive, with some jangly electric acoustic guitar and a smattering of G4 drums, I suppose this fits in simultaneously with the ""twee"" tag and the Morr 
    Music ethos, but it's just fucking boring. The song titles contain more pronouns than you can possibly imagine (""You"", ""What She Felt"", ""We Walk""-- get the picture?), and the 
    subject matter-- girls and boys in love/hate admiration-- has passed through the digestive system of so many like-minded (and much better) bands that the 
    familiar taste is really starting to overpower the packaging.  Maybe for the comatose or half-conscious this isn't really a problem; when you're in the mood for your music to just maintain that 
    mood, and the components aren't of great importance, an album like <i>I Know You Know</i> might not be so offensive. Julia Guther's voice does slip nicely into the haut couture of the 
    music, so whatever Guther is trying to pull off, they've done some homework. But what Morr Music would have us call a ""summer record"" would be better described as beige wallpaper: 
    nondescript, and easily ignored. And this from the people who brought you Lali Puna and Mum.</p><p>
    
    Julia Guther and Berend Intelmann think they've stumbled on a frequency that vibrates your heartstrings, and they ain't turning the dial anytime soon. Their 
    timid vulnerability and doe-eyed sensitivity positively beg for a Louisville Slugger to the jaw: <i>I Know You Know</i> is less a collection of indie-vidual folktronica 
    tunes than one long, self-absorbed sulk-fest on a big pink canopy bed, cigarettes stashed behind the dresser, vintage jeans strewn across the carpet, locked in the baroque mansion 
    of <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>.</p></div>"|3611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3611-i-know-you-know/|2.0|Mark Martelli

    century is how crucial Captain Beefheart's Magic Band was to the compositional process behind their askew, beautiful music. For years the emphasis was on the enigmatic 
    Captain himself, and at the heart of his rock legend lay <i>Trout Mask Replica</i>, whose 28 songs-- as the story goes-- Captain Beefheart (né Don Van Vliet) spurted out in 8 1/2 hours, 
    fully-formed, then laid down in the studio with the Magic Band in a half that time. A revealing book penned by drummer John French, and an all instrumental practice tape from 
    that time that accompanied the box and nixed such instant creation myths. The Band worked assiduously with scant food or money in a cult-like situation to make random notes 
    and patterns-- bare scraps of madman thought-- cohere, winding through wildly varied trains of musical thought and figuring how to converge and crash into some 
    alien semblance of sound sense. While I was crestfallen to have the human hands behind the god-like apparatus of <i>Trout Mask Replica</i> revealed, my dismay 
    was quickly replaced by respect for how luminous the band actually was, seeing the intricate, impossible moving parts glimpsed without the iconoclastic bellows and 
    musings of Don Van Vliet overwhelming them.</p><p>
    Even without Van Vliet (who retired from music in the early eighties), the reconvening of this league of gentlemen for the last All Tomorrow's Parties in Camber 
    Sands was something special. That it took over thirty years for a portion of this anomalous music to finally be appreciated by the populace was an incredible breakthrough, and the 
    chance for these hard-working musicians to get any bit of delayed recognition is deserved. To commemorate the event, the band headed into the studio to tape their rehearsals for 
    the comeback concert. They slashed their way through the strongest points of the Beefheart catalog, focusing on early tracks such as ""Abba Zabba"" and ""Dropout Boogie"" to warm 
    up before heading into the serrated edges of several Trout Mask tunes like ""Steal Softly Through Snow"", ""Moonlight on Vermont"" and ""Hair Pie"".</p><p>
    This version of The Magic Band serves as strata for the various phases of the group. None of the members ever played together-- as this lineup-- before, an intriguing 
    match-up in and of its own right. From their nascent beginnings comes John ""Drumbo"" French, whose musical transcriptions of Van Vliet's of-the-moment blurts helped 
    lay out most of <i>Trout Mask Replicas</i>. It's his multi-dimensional tom rhythms and snapping cymbals that ""tied together"" the numerous Beefheart records, according to the 
    Captain himself. Bassist Mark ""Rockette Morton"" Boston came into the <i>Trout Mask</i> commune and played through <i>Clear Spot</i>. Even with all the extensive research that 
    went into the <i>Grow Fins</i> project, they failed to unearth him, and he only recently resurfaced, still powered by ""laser beans."" Denny ""Feelers Reebo"" Walley was a latter-day 
    guitarist on the original <i>Shiny Beast</i> while Gary ""Mantis"" Lucas was the Captain's manager near the end of his career, actualizing the near-impossible guitar compositions 
    like ""Flavor Bud Living"" and ""Evening Bell"". It's a shame that Bill ""Zoot Horn Rollo"" Harkleroad could not join in the proceedings.</p><p>
    The compositional oddness of differing meters and the clashing keys of jarring note crashes will always be the touchstones of the Magic Band in 
    most folks' minds, but it's the more straight-forward blues palpitations of ""Click Clack"", ""I'm Gonna Booglarize You Baby"", ""Floppy Boot Stomp"", ""Circumstances"" and ""Nowadays a 
    Woman's Got to Hit a Man"" that I return to most often these days (curiously, there's nothing after '72-- perhaps because Boston never knew any compositions after this period?) 
    Built up from the relentless bottom end of a Hooker-like endless boogie, the drum rhythms also draw from more mechanical sources like train engines and windshield wiper 
    patterns (Beefheart was a Lakers fan as well, loving the beats that the basketball would make), creating a lower-body pulse and chug. From these deep grooves, the two 
    guitars would then slide and splatter like dueling paint brushes, freely coalescing colorful lines around Van Vliet, giving his voice ample space to growl 
    and blow harp on.</p><p>
    Of course, Don's not here, and as admirably as the Band lays out the tracks, there's ultimately no steam engine train to smoke over them. French does his best Beefheart impersonation, 
    hitting those weird coyote cackles and guttural blues lines, huffing some  competent harmonica too; but his voice on ten of the seventeen selections is a bit much though, and I wish 
    for more moments like that of the <i>Trout Mask</i> practice sessions, where you could finally glean the irregular cogs of the compositions interlocking. The best example of this is on an 
    instrumental take of the only song resuscitated from <i>Lick My Decals Off, Baby</i>, ""I Wanna Find Me a Woman That'll Hold My Big Toe Till I Have To Go"". Freed from Van Vliet's genius, 
    cheeky poetry, we can hear the gentle yet intricate flexing and relaxing of the band for the first time. More of these moments would have made this more crucial, perhaps 
    even as a good single disc intro to the man, but while John French does the growl'n groan admirably, he's no Captain, and that man's presence is still sorely missed.</p></div>"|5032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5032-back-to-the-front/|7.3|Andy Beta

    of the Beach Boys: check The Thrills, a troop of shaggy-haired Dubliners who, after camping out in San Diego
    for four months, have successfully adopted the breezy, sun-seeking saunter of California's much-mythologized
    coastal heroes.  On the band's glossy debut, <i>So Much for the City</i>, vocalist Conor Deasy casually drops
    references to Big Sur and the massive, gleaming beaches of Santa Cruz, name-checking Hollywood kids, Las
    Vegas, and gently creeping tides while beautifully channeling the Boys' sweet coo-- and without the slightest
    hint of thick Irish brogue.</p><p>
    
    Lifting styles and sounds is a ballsy proposition, but it's not a particularly shocking one.  While agitated
    classic rock fans might be tempted to drag issues of purity and authenticity into their early morning,
    PBR-tainted cock fights, co-opting and barefaced mugging have been indisputable parts of the rock equation
    ever since Presley started gyrating on TV.  Even the biggest late-60s UK acts like the Stones and Led Zeppelin
    nicked their sweets from the Americana store, channeling coarse delta blues into something louder, rounder,
    and a little bit whiter.  Therefore, The Thrills' perplexing geographic origins should ideally remain entirely
    irrelevant to the stuff of their record: a competent, satisfying pop spread, packed with impeccable vocal
    harmonies, happy keyboards, jangly guitar, and plenty of fades.</p><p>
    
    That The Thrills' hometown seems so stupidly anachronistic in the context of their music is-- surprise!-- a
    perfectly valid quibble: their decision to metaphorically (and, temporarily, physically) transplant themselves
    might be the only compelling creative choice they made.  <i>So Much for the City</i>'s sticky, pop-pleasant
    aesthetic has been straightforwardly pilfered from the last forty-something years of pop tradition (The Byrds
    to the Beach Boys to Ben Folds to Grandaddy) without nearly enough alterations to justify its brazen nods;
    even their bandname has been sported by a whole mess of artists already.  I'm not saying every Irish act has
    to (or even <i>should</i>) sound like The Pogues, but The Thrills' external, sometime vaccuous pinching is
    clearly self-conscious, a carefully premeditated breach of expectation that causes more of a wince than a
    flash of pleasant surprise.</p><p>
    
    Still, there are some great summer-songs here: ""Santa Cruz (You're Not That Far)"" has a rolling rise-and-fall
    melody, sliding from a high, lazy piano-and-vocals intro into a full-band crest, punched up by spotless
    harmonies, bursts of harmonica and consistently bright percussion.  Majestic and equally ocean-inspired,
    ""Don't Steal Our Sun"" features cut-time piano and drums, nicely timed shifts, and convincingly aggressive
    vocals, while ""Big Sur"" proves that The Thrills are capable of more than blind regurgitation: searing open
    with a zap of synth, the track's bouncy guitar, scratchy banjo and inescapable hooks are promising, and
    even the ""baby, baby, please don't go"" lyrics become kinda charming by halfway through. </p><p>
    
    Bands are always inadvertently shoveled into scenes and movements, often based on little other than their
    hometown addresses; it's that kind of arbitrary pigeonholing that allows for buzzwords and media-centric
    ""hot spots,"" marketing tricks and random cash-ins.  The idea of preemptively eschewing all that shit is
    understandably appealing-- but The Thrills could have thought a bit harder about finding a bright new sound
    to go with their suddenly sunny locale.  This one's taken.</p></div>"|8037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8037-so-much-for-the-city/|6.9|Amanda Petrusich

Back when I first started to buy CDs-- at a bank-busting clip-- I liked looking through used bins and finding bands 
    with oddball setups; chances are if it was less than eight bucks and had a sackbut or a nyckelharpa in the credits, it got bought.  Of course this led to a lot of bum purchases 
    (I suppose it was better than working from song lengths, like I did in my prog phase), but I never would have dug into the catalogues of Lullaby for the Working Class, Calexico or 
    Die Anarchistische Abendunterhaltung-- a Dutch four-piece whose name translates to the Anarchistic Evening Entertainment-- otherwise, so I like to chalk it up as a 
    reasonably successful buying habit.</p><p>
    
    Thanks to the increased financial burdens of adulthood, I'm well out of that phase now, but I can't help getting a bit giddy when a disc leads off as <i>Olden</i> does, with the twanging 
    jew's harp and trembling bandoneon (similar to an accordion) of ""American Wheeze"".  These two instruments slowly coalesce into a blisteringly dark groove before David Eugene 
    Edwards (grandson of a traveling Nazarene preacher) opens his mouth, exhaling a scorching breath of fire and brimstone.  This is the world Sixteen Horsepower have meticulously created 
    over the last decade, one where everybody's days are numbered, all sinners get their due, and you could be next.  <i>Olden</i> chronicles their crucial early phase, before they had even released 
    an album, scooping together two electrifying six-song demos and a hellraising live performance.  As baby steps go, these are about as confident and destructive as they come.</p><p>
    
    The band's initial creative burst was truly amazing. These recordings date from 1993 and 1994 (five were reprised on the late-90s LP <i>Low Estate</i>); knowing 
    the band allowed them to incubate for so long is an indication of just how mature their craft was early on.  ""American Wheeze"" was one of those songs, and you can hear its 
    evolution here, as it's included in two very different forms: the aforementioned version and a later one that more closely anticipates the frantic final album take.  The rawness of these 
    recordings suits the band perfectly, capturing the slide guitar in particular in its gutbucket glory.  ""South Pennsylvania Waltz"" is manic and violent, while the live version of ""Pure Clob Road"" 
    feels like the circus with the tent collapsing, Edwards acting the part of panicked ringmaster, squeezing his bandoneon in singing in a frenzied half-shout.  </p><p>
    
    If Sixteen Horsepower ever had a problem on their albums, it's that a couple of tracks always sag in the face of their potential, but that doesn't happen here.  
    In fact, the only thing disturbing the disc's flow is the genuinely odd placement of two inconsequential interview snippets at the end of the two demo sessions.  As interviews, they shed 
    light on nothing, and serve only to gum up the transitions between sections of the compilation.  These days, you wonder why-- provided the funds existed-- the folks at Jetset didn't add 
    an enhanced video portion with a full, video interview.  It would have been more generous to the fans likely to buy this, and it would have helped the overall product feel more 
    unified.  As it stands, their inclusion is a real poser.  </p><p>
    
    Still, when ""Slow Guilt Trot"" rages in to start the live set after the second interview bit, it's hard to deny the onslaught.  The disc ends on a breakneck live rendition of <i>Low Estate</i>'s ""Dead 
    Run"", which features some of Edwards' most emphatically dire exhortations with lines like ""One by one, we croak like the raven"" and ""The undertaker knows/ He lays the headstones in 
    endless rows.""  The band's brutal blues-punk attack must have been exhilarating for anyone lucky enough to be at the show.  </p><p>
    
    Recently, Sixteen Horsepower have become more measured in their approach, refining their sound into a more Appalachian mold-- their fifth album, last year's <i>Folklore</i>, contains multiple 
    covers of traditional songs-- and they've taken on a different power as a unit as a result.  Despite its archival nature, <i>Olden</i> captures the band at their fiery peak and sans the filler that 
    slowed their early records; it's an excellent starting point for the uninitiated.</p></div>"|7210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7210-olden/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Just like we did all those years ago.  Step aboard, and be shown a grand old time amongst all this
    lived-in luxury and second-hand splendor.  Astro-boys and girls, it's time for a hit parade of Andy Partridge's old junk-- and you can't get this stuff just
    anywhere (or so the old marketing slogan goes).  Each piece of secret fruit, bursting with stale hope and forgotten promise, is a specimen of unique
    gem-craft lovingly assembled by your favorite lonely toy soldier enthusiast behind the curtain.  Where in dog's green girth could you plunder
    such willing treasures?  Sit back and be swept up and under the buzzing thunder, up inside your mum's weeping underskirt: Ba pa pa pa pa p-- no.
    This must end now.</p><p>
    
    XTC's bitter half has reeled in this cold fish four times.  I admit it: after years of compulsive Partridge purchasing, all the smart money was on me
    buying his latest collection of demos and throwaways, despite being a little underwhelmed by last year's inaugural volumes.  You'd think I'd have learned
    my lesson by now.  Still, it's hard to root against guys like him making a pound or two at my expense-- in the back of mind, maybe I'm thinking he'll
    put some of the surplus towards, oh I don't know, making a new record one day.  And speaking of marketing slogans, any good merchant knows that a bad
    customer will spill their fury for every one lucky friend of the Swindon-4-Life Disciple.  In other words, I'll keep buying your stuff, Andy, but <i>I'm gonna tell
    everyone about it</i>.</p><p>
    
    Just to show that my thinly-veiled agenda hasn't completely ruined my ability to think critically, I'll point out all the stuff that totally sucks
    first-- I figure it's only fair.  Exhibit 1(a)(i): Partridge demonstrates his penchant for lamer-than-thou, wink-wink, ain't-I-the-Dickens, ""Holy Partidge, it's a genre sendup!""
    with the yellow sub-<i>That Thing You Do</i> Brit-Invaded tripe that is ""My Train is Coming"".  Goofy 7th chords?  Check.  Harmonica and cowbell?  30-love.
    Textbook middle eight?  Advantage hyuck.  And for all of the tune's obvious moves, it's actually Partidge's inability to muster any kind of raucous,
    early Lennon (or McCartney for that matter) larynx tearing soul that made all those pre-<i>Rubber Soul</i> hits so great.  In short, our man at Ape
    is just no good at rock.</p><p>
    
    It turns out he's no good at Chinese disco either, as the bedroom Casio adventures of ""You Like Me?"" reveal.  It starts innocently enough with bells
    and fake Asian strings, like those you might hear in a car commercial aimed at yuppies that still think you have to be multiculturally aware to hide your
    inherently nerdy tendencies.  Then he gets PBS on your ass.  When the beat drops-- I guess it's supposed to be a dance beat of some kind-- it
    feels more like it's out to support visuals of fluorescent kites and pre-schoolers running after butterflies, all computer animated circa 1987.  At least Newton's
    Apple had Kraftwerk!  Still, nothing compares to the devastating horror of his stab at hip-hop on Volume 4's ""Zonked Right Out on Life"".
    Partridge's thoughts on this particular song-styling expedition: ""As in most rap, the 'c' is silent.""  Don't believe the hype, A.  Actually, in this case,
    believe the shit out of it.</p><p>
    
    I haven't even gotten to the actual throwaways: ""Tunes"" and ""I'm Playing My Fano"" manage to avoid the lowest depths of indifference
    merely by beating the clock.  That's more than I can say for the handful of XTC demos included on these volumes.  Last year's <i>Coat of Many Cupboards</i>
    presented the band's ugly underneath in a fashion humble and more than a tad endearing.  However, I'd also argue it should have been the final word on
    demos of previously released stuff from them-- by this point, Partridge is running out of decent versions of his tunes to release, and I'm running out
    of patience with his faith in my compulsive buying habits.  No sir, I simply don't need flat, out of tune renditions of ""Great Fire"" or ""That's Really
    Super, Supergirl"".</p><p>
    
    The worst part-- just as with the first two volumes in this series-- is there <i>are</i> a few good songs buried in the mix.  On <i>Volume 3</i>,
    Partridge wisely follows up ""My Train is Coming"" with the entirely fresh ""Lightheaded"", sounding every bit the sprightly, digital age piece of
    psychedelic candy he should be blessing us with full-time.  Likewise, the hazy, almost off-kilter, poppy seedling ""Blue Beret"" is a slap in the face
    to anyone who thought XTC's <i>Oranges &amp; Lemons</i> was too adult-contemporary.  Here, Partridge makes a case that he does the <i>White Album</i> better than a <i>Magical
    Mystery Tour</i>, as he further proves on the dense, chugging ""This is the End"".   That tune was originally meant to close <i>Oranges &amp; Lemons, but was scrapped when our
    hero realized Cookie Monster beat him to the chord progression.  That might've stopped some people from releasing it entirely, but such is the
    persistence of the P.</i></p><p>
    
    These multi-volume demo collections are made for fans only, and dear fan, you must be very, very serious in order to get
    enthused about most of the music contained here.  Truthfully, I doubt I could make a decent half-hour mix out of listenable tunes from this pair.
    If they'd come from anyone else, I wouldn't think twice about selling them back instantly.  Fellow Partridge disciples, don't give up
    the fight-- surely, he'll return to save us from a world where the soundtrack from <i>Punch Drunk Love</i> is the best thing going for eccentric
    anglophiles.  Surely he will.  Right?</p></div>"|6182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6182-fuzzy-warbles-volumes-3-4/|4.9|Dominique Leone

Not for lack of trying, I just couldn't physically <i>hear</i> the subtleties within 
    the collaborative work of the world's foremost ""sound""-- for lack of a more concrete descriptor-- improvisers the label thrives on, due to cacophonic street noise 
    right outside my window (it drowned out all but the most strident noises). The digitized percussion duo of L\xEA Quan Ninh and Günter Müller dissolved in the 
    Brooklyn street din while the dog whistle sinewaves and razors of Toshimaru Nakamura and Sachiko M's <i>do</i> were unrecoverable underneath the truck brakes, street 
    chatter, and ""dink-dink-dink"" music blasting past the window at all hours.</p><p>
    Now that I'm in the back room, away from the street, I can discern more of what's happening between one of Erstwhile's most stalwart artists, English tabletop guitarist 
    Keith Rowe and an AMM bandmate of his going back to the start of the eighties, pianist John Tilbury. It's funny that, while Rowe's duo work has come into prominence over the 
    past few years-- performing and recording prolifically with Nakamura, Müller, Australian guitarist Oren Ambarchi, and others-- this double CD marks the first occasion 
    he has ever performed with Tilbury exclusively.</p><p>
    Those familiar with the instant sound universes created by hardy perennials AMM will not detect any straying from that singular and difficult path. Instead, their sounds are 
    distilled further and reconsidered yet again, the two gents disappearing into the spaces of the recording room, reticent to disrupt the silences that abound about them. Rowe 
    rustles at a low volume, the guitar pick-ups and shortwave radio picking up what sounds to be the very air itself, charged with a constant crackle. Tilbury remains resolute until 
    he hears what needs to be released. Thirty minutes into the seventy-minute first disc, ""Cathnor"", he carefully extracts the tiny percussive sounds of John Cage's prepared piano 
    (something Tilbury has interpreted before). Faint and melodic, his lines evoke distant buoys in the bay, swaying with the unseen ocean that Rowe provides.</p><p>
    At forty minutes, Tilbury further gleans the melody, carving out sustained chords in an elongated ascension that draws more on his exquisite interpretations of New York composer Morton 
    Feldman. These chords soon gain gravity, clanging with a pained-- almost brittle-- sound commingled with thunderous low stabs on the piano, as Keith Rowe gathers metallic 
    storm clouds in louder scrapes, reaching a catharsis that is the exact opposite to the eye of this hurricane, the center being the densest point in the music. Given the recording 
    note that Tilbury's mother passed away two days before the session, it's not surprising to feel that emotional release with him here.</p><p>
    ""Olaf"" is another long exploration, this time at forty-five minutes, featuring Tilbury's percussive taps on the piano wood and Rowe's rather peculiar version of the ether, 
    with a bit more radio captured. I wonder what a car trip with Keith would be like, as he modulates the knobs and ratio between reception/static constantly, coming in and out of 
    perception. The piano recalls its previous prepared sounds, achieving music box tones as Rowe blows about like wind into a field-recording mic. The final piece, ""Oxleay"", 
    has Tilbury exacting ineffable filaments from the space, sometimes just the clack of a high key against the wire, while Rowe respires and hums at near-indiscernible volumes, 
    often drowning in the outside sounds of ceiling fan hum and air conditioning, occasionally reminding you of his gentle presence. It's as there or not there as you want it to 
    be, which is something to think about when people are-- physically, at least-- no longer with you.</p></div>"|6848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6848-duos-for-doris/|7.8|Andy Beta

The fussiest critic I had available 
    to me, my barely two-month old cousin Caitlyn, would soon unwittingly answer a recent musical query-- whether the enjoyment of sound was hinged upon recognizable cultural 
    structures like language and tonality, or whether there was something inherently deeper present in all music, from which pleasure could be equally derived 
    independent of age, sex, or ethnicity.</p><p>
    
    To establish a baseline of response, I previously exposed Caitlyn to countless hours of the <i>Nuggets</i> compilation, which she particularly enjoyed.  I was now ready to 
    present her with the ""experimental"" recording-- Dengue Fever's self-titled debut, released on Trey Spruance's (Mr. Bungle) Web of Mimicry label.</p><p>
    
    ""Alright Caitlyn,"" I said, with babbling affectations sprinkled throughout, ""I need you to listen to this album, and give me your honest response regarding every note you hear."" 
    I prompted her to squeeze my index finger in acknowledgement before continuing to supply her with some background information on the group.  ""The band consists of some real 
    top-notch musicians: the brothers Holtzman, Zac on guitar and Ethan on farfisa organ-- the former of Dieselhed pedigree-- saxophonist and Beck-collaborator David Ralicke, 
    drummer Paul Smith, and bassist Senon Williams of the Radar Brothers.  The story on the female lead-vocalist, Chhom Nimol, is pretty incredible as well, the singer getting her 
    start as a Cambodian pop star who frequently entertained requests from the royal palace for private concerts with the king and queen.""</p><p>
    
    I checked all corroborating factors-- food, diaper, and temperature-- once more before signaling to the babe that I was ready to begin when she was.  With the drop of her arms 
    I pressed play, prompting the sultry melody of ""Lost In Laos"" to begin, my eyes trained intensely upon the glib expressions the child would soon issue.</p><p>
    
    Observation #1: Initially little response, but after a minute and a half, head shaking was exhibited.</p><p>
    
    Though the sax-infused opening tune left her a bit cold, the swelling tones and tinny-warm guitar line soon made Caitlyn swing in her crib, while Nimol's high-pitched and 
    wavering voice fit in harmoniously with the perforated rhythm section.  This excitement continued through to ""I'm Sixteen"" and ""22 Nights"", songs equally influenced by Khmer 
    heritage and the surf guitar of Dick Dale.  The tracks focus on the vertical aspect of the music also had a pleasing effect on Caitlyn, causing her to spit up in excitement over a 
    sound so rich in harmonic engorging.</p><p>
    
    Observation #2: Subject covers her eyes while concurrently moving legs up and down in a rhythmic manner.</p><p>
    
    A brass skeleton, ""Hold My Hips"" is a decidedly meaner track focusing on the darker aspects of dance music that is only occasionally punched through by island flourishes 
    of bright instrumentation.  ""Flowers"" continues this theme with a droll dialogue established between the saxophone and organ, creating a melody not completely unlike 
    something spawned by The Hollies or The Byrds ca. <i>Younger Than Yesterday</i>.  The many stops and starts juxtapose nicely with the near fugal progression of ""Thanks-A-Lot"", 
    which develops over the period of its brief life from a sparse fuzz-guitar driven tune into a liquid cool melody complete with male-female harmonizing vocals.  ""New Year's Eve"" 
    rounds out this relatively sinister portion of the album with a creeping bass line that increases in tempo exponentially until finally progressing into a high-register dance song 
    with psychedelic underpinnings, ultimately plummeting back toward its roots in the quagmire of languid silence.</p><p>
    
    Observation #3: After a brief episode of crying, subject returns to happy state, with erratic movement of all appendages.</p><p>
    
    I had an inkling of the notion prior to viewing her expressions of glee, but by the song's end it was confirmed that funk is part-in-part the universal language.  ""Ethanopium"", 
    an instrumental take on one of the Ethiopiques series' jewels, begins with a thumping rhythm bound high in the mix, but the true worth of the song lies in the continuous 
    and-- I have to say it-- sexy bass, that draws a straight line directly to the soul-funk of early-60s James Brown.  ""Glass of Wine"" sharpens up the mood a bit with a more 
    traditionally foreign sound that provides a pleasantly flush backdrop for Nimol's ensuing conversation with a wavering guitar and a simple organ melody.  Creeping 
    psychedelica inevitably returns to the surface of the album though, on both the chromatically playful ""Shave Your Beard"" and the sax-lullaby ""Pow Pow"".   The groove ultimately 
    finds its resting place among the South Pacific dreams of ""Connect Four"", an original Dengue Fever-tune that glides along like a percolating Stereolab on beach vacation.</p><p>
    
    Not content to merely providing glorious pop-tunes in easily digested song-wrapped packets, Dengue Fever choose the high road of cultural exposure, forcing the hand of the 
    listener in a bid to fully comprehend their art.  Though the lyrics are readily available online for those that choose to follow the stories along with the music-- and I recommend it-- one 
    does not have to understand the content to appreciate what it means to have a good time.  As Caitlyn and I discovered, as long as it's of a quality design, novel experiences such as 
    <i>Dengue Fever</i> can prove to be just as-- if not more-- exciting than that which you may readily call comfortable or normal, though it may require the unexpected help of a humble and 
    uninformed perspective.</p></div>"|2505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2505-dengue-fever/|7.9|Andrew Bryant

    guitar-based music, it's probably no accident. After all, they're generally after the same type of music listeners, all seeking the same core emotions, albeit from different sounds.  Freescha, 
    the California-based duo of Nick Huntington and Michael McGroarty, make that second kind of indie electronic pop: the sort of warm, melodic, almost twee sound that sells well at 
    Darla.com, and is favored by the majority of the Morr and City Centre Offices rosters.</p><p>
<i>Whats Come Inside of You</i> (sic) is Freescha's third full-length (following 2000's <i>Kids Fill the Floor</i> and 2002's <i>Slower Than Church Music</i>), available from 
    their self-run Attacknine label. Perhaps less distinctive than many of their peers, Freescha is taking slight steps away from the organic, clean sounds perfected by Boards of Canada
    and, more recently, Carpark Records' Casino Versus Japan, with whom the California duo recently shared a spot on that label's <i>Wanna Buy a Crapark?</i> compilation. Freescha 
    is still primarily making fluid, mid-tempo, synthesizer-based sounds, but their latest effort is boosted by primarily 4/4 beats, a further emphasis on overt hooks, and more compact and 
    digestible song structures.</p><p>
    The album's provocative, retrograde art suggests a more decadent direction, citing 70s porn, Ming the Merciless, roller-skating, and boom boxes as suggested inspirations. For the most part, 
    however, that seems like a bit of red herring. Despite the near-electro throb of opener ""Rinky Dink""-- which starts off like a bouncy filter-disco version of ""Crocodile Rock""-- the record quickly 
    settles into more traditionally ambient glitch-pop patterns. Like BoC, Freescha dress their sounds in a lot of delay and echo, using dub as a production inspiration more than aiming directly 
    for its spatial qualities. Freescha retains the waterlogged, reverb-heavy feel of electronic dub, but their BoC-style analogue toy box nostalgia suggests they are clouding time and memory 
    rather than simply drum and bass. Vocals are used scarcely and, when employed, are buried under echo or treated with a vocoder, making any words essentially indistinguishable. The 
    sensation of communication is more important here than the message.</p><p>
    The most distinctive of the vocal passages are snippets of heavy breathing and erotic moaning. They're more overtly sexual than sensual as the cover art - as well as song titles such as 
    ""Come Good"" and ""Lover Function""-- suggests. It's the tracks that most tactfully toe those lines between the seedy and sentimental that are the most rewarding, mostly notably the understated, 
    slowly unfolding ""Baby Maker"" or ""Come Good,"" which-- like much of the second-half of the album-- is a dead-ringer for Air. And therein lies part of the problem. With simplistic rhythms and 
    uncomplicated melodies, Freeshca are certainly crafting easygoing, inviting sounds, but are trying to tempt us down very familiar paths.</p></div>"|3263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3263-whats-come-inside-of-you/|6.3|Scott Plagenhoef

    guitar-less trio whose blend of Goth-inflected horror-film synthesizers, new-wave rat-a-tat drumming, murkily driving bass, and Mike Kelley-esque 
    Children of the Night imagery wades rather predictably within the pools of dark-edged 80s dance music. The three raven-haired demigods have the 
    Look and the Sound, but their obsessive conceptual pose-- based on stale leftovers of the Sisters of Mercy's semi-apocalyptic trope= - falters 
    whenever someone opens their mouth to shout about ""scary"" stuff. On their first full-length <i>Songs For Psychotic Children</i>, Eva's mostly nonsensical 
    tales of the macabre are redundant and overwrought, her vocal tracks approaching darkness with the subtlety of a full-body ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" 
    tattoo.  Stylistically, her densely trebled vocals initially bring to mind the beloved warble of early-period Siouxsie, but instead of mixing 
    restraint with the full-throttle howl, she chants through the album's five vocal tracks with relatively unchanged cadences.</p><p>
    Despite the overtly gothic ministrations, <i>Songs For Psychotic Children</i> strikes like a treatise on memory and trauma via allegories of girls with 
    barbed wire teeth, Dorian Gray mirrors, and that old Victorian standard: ballrooms of rotting fruit. Damn! Toned down a bit, these sentiments 
    would be less cartoonish and all the more frightening; I prefer the moments between vocals, the portions less tightly connected to a 
    psycho-ward cliché.</p><p>
    On ""White Walls"" there's much obnoxiously vehement screaming about the lost traces of history buried within whitewashing, but 
    ironically, the ten seconds of fascistic white noise at the end of the track are its most interesting moment, finally burying all that whining in a grave 
    of foreboding feedback. ""Lost in Pictures"" continues the focus on forgotten shadows and the spaces that memories haunt: \x93Children scream through 
    cellophane, a thin layer of hell/ They suffocate trapped in the last position they fell/ 'We live in the shadows on the floor where we will fall 
    / No one will ever hear our voice because we are so small.'""  So, basically, my grandfather's hard candies come wrapped in a 'thin layer of hell'? That's 
    fucked up.</p><p>
    The instrumentals make more sense, or at least hold together better. For listeners who've grown up with a television and access to Stephen King 
    books, the language of horror is firmly ingrained in our psyches and well-enough understood, even on the most corporeal, non-thinking level; we don't need 
    a cheat sheet.  On the band's first instrumental (which is untitled), a synthesizer approximates pulsating wind from outside a window while another sprays atmospherics, 
    humming with horror film obviousness. This track aims to evoke a particular setting; for example, an old dark house on a cold rainy night? ""Sighs on 
    Pyres"" is reminiscent of a slow-as-molasses ""You Belong To The City"", but as a Gothic reinvention with choirs of Casio keyboards pre-set to the ""spooky"" 
    sounds. The fast-paced ""Obituary""-- the album's strongest track-- is a Vampiric dance party bringing to mind both OMD and Psychic TV.  The final piece on 
    the album (also an untitled instrumental) swivels upon the same windy, sawing synthesizer as the opener, but sounds more spacious, interiority replaced 
    with a sense of notes resting in the air, ungrounded, ready to fly o'er the horizon, the silent ghosts that come to terrorize you softly each night.</p><p>
    One of the more interesting aspects of the less-extreme forms of ""evil"" music and the culture that follows are the slippages between the humdrum 
    surroundings of daily existence and the escape into temporary transcendence, to clove-and-absinthe-scented dance clubs. When too many dark 
    buttons are pushed, self-parody becomes a difficult thing to avoid: it's so much harder to fear something that makes you laugh, unless you're laughing 
    nervously. All in all, for this sort of over-determined, laughable evil, I'd rather listen to Cradle of Filth; though their approach is equally schlock-y, 
    they actually make me nervous.</p></div>"|8509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8509-songs-for-psychotic-children/|6.9|Brandon Stosuy

""Blueside"", the lead track on
    <i>Rooney</i>, makes all the Weezer-meets-Beach-Boys rhetoric surrounding this band seem warranted.  Sure,
    it might sound like a bland concept, what with the whining guitar lead and vocals not unlike Mr. Cuomo's,
    but then the chorus comes crashing in, and it does the things one expects a pop chorus to do: 1) it gets all
    the harmonies and magical stuff you can't be bothered with while in the moment stuck in your head; 2) it
    invokes its title, ""Blueside"", ensuring that gets stuck in your head, too.  And consequently, it becomes 3)
    the one truly memorable part of the song-- the bit you'll find yourself singing hours later-- and, 4) the
    moment that embarrasses the other parts of the tune so soundly that the listener is left waiting for the
    chorus to come around again, like a caffeine addict waiting in line at the Dunkin Donuts for something tall,
    dark, and sugary.  It's a style that never goes out of style.</p><p>
    But before you go gaga, join their street team and pledge allegiance to the cute little brown bear featured
    on the band's propaganda, note that this particular song ends up being the highest high Rooney's record hits.
    It's not that the other ten tracks pale in comparison-- actually, ""Stay Away"" is right up there, jonesing on
    a naïve Cheap Trick vibe-- but all of these songs are the same damn color.  ""Blueside"" gets the benefit of
    the doubt simply by being the first track.  In light of what follows, it's no more or less spectacular a
    song than any of their others, which is a shame.</p><p>
    The color I referred to in the last paragraph, by the way, is blue.  It's the pastel blue you might recall
    serving as the backdrop of the photograph of those four nondescript fellows on the cover of that record with
    the song about Mary Tyler Moore on it.  But instead of meting the lovey dovey crap with helpings of gunky
    sweaters and 20-sided dice (or, as all <i>Pinkerton</i> lovers remember, wanton and desperate vulnerability),
    Rooney offer up detached professional tales of girl-wanting, girl-lusting, girl-having and other male
    adolescent hormonal endeavors-- the same type of endeavors, by the way, that these immaculately produced pop
    stars refer to (""You've hit me again one more time"", ""Bye bye bye bye bye bye goodbye"") as ""the killers of rock
    and roll"" in ""Popstars"".  As Bart Simpson once said, the ironing is delicious.</p><p>
    Another wrinkle worth noting: as great and clean as this record sounds-- thanks in large part to those
    ""unsophisticated money machines""-- its cleanliness saps the songs of any personality or charm, qualities
    that could rescue them their boring, almost admirable compositional merits.  All the accoutrements are
    meticulously placed in the proper spots.  When the drums start sounding mechanical (see ""Terrible Person"")
    or the guitars are turned up to 11 (see ""Daisy Duke""-- 80s pop cult ref ahoy!), or the synthesizers are set
    on Fun-Filled Spooky (see the intro to ""Kristen""), it works; when the band starts mimicking the recognizable
    big bang boom that Rivers &amp; Co. trademarked and copyrighted nine years ago, it doesn't: ""Daisy Duke"" is
    ""Buddy Holly"" rewritten as an anti-ballad.  ""If It Were Up to Me"" is shamelessly mimics ""Holiday"", and the
    introduction to ""Losing Control"" sounds suspiciously like REO Speedwagon's ""Can't Fight This Feeling""-- a
    punishable offense in most countries.</p><p>
<i>Rooney</i> is an acceptably underwhelming, state of the art, guitar-centric pop record.  This would be a
    fine thing except for the hubris on display, best exemplified by ""Popstars""-- which, contrary to what Rooney
    might want to believe, is what they are trying to become.  Given Rooney's current label affiliation (that's
    Geffen, as in Interscope, as in a big honkin' cog in that money machine) and the amount of label-generated
    buzz these five chaps are currently benefiting from, calling out Britney and Justin for raking in crazy
    money isn't a brilliant move to bust on your first album.  As a wise man once asked, ""Why do they gotta
    front?""</p></div>"|6830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6830-rooney/|6.5|David Raposa

    auditory sweet spots that exist independent of logic and reason. Maybe it has something to do with an odd brain geography that's resulted in some
    quadrant being unusually receptive to certain kind of stimuli. Perhaps repressed childhood memories, or forgotten dreams, or some bender-induced
    chemical rearrangement from before I knew better are to blame. All I'm sure of is that some combinations of sounds do it for me every time and it
    becomes difficult (and not very much fun) to decide whether this music I'm drooling over is ""good"" or not.</p><p>
    Listening to <i>Ripple</i>, the debut album from Fonica (Japanese boy/girl duo Keiich Sugimoto and Cheason) I realize I'm mad for the sound of pretty, 
    repeating guitars mixed with warm, glitchy electronics. Simply put, when the electro-acoustic guitar/DSP combo is done in a certain way, it can make me
    cry. I <em>think</em> I'm enjoying this album so damn much because Keiich &amp; Cheason are skilled at mixing the acoustic and electric guitar patterns with
    the beeping, static-laden drone underneath, but I'm allowing for the possibility that I'm just a sucker for this sound. Honestly, I'm enjoying
    <i>Ripple</i> too much to care.</p><p>
    The track titles on this alubm are appropriately simple markers of a single idea or impression, titles like ""Soar"" and ""Perch"" and ""Fluid"". Most cuts are a
    bustle of activity, small taps and clicks and keyboard squiggles that mesh into a buzzing sonic tapestry; foregrounded is a simple guitar
    melody that accentuates the pale, blurred color of the mood. Though the laptop processing pioneered by Markus Popp and referenced here suggest the
    beauty of a purely mathematical world, Fonica have completely humanized and softened their glitches, so that their prime references are sensation and
    memory. These tracks make you remember things like the tingle that climbs up your arms as you wade into a lake.</p><p>
    It's interesting to hear Sogar's Jürgen Heckel crop up on ""Whirr"" (he's credited with ""sound materials""), as his recent album <i>Apikal.blend</i> on 12k
    definitely marks him as a kindred spirit. Heckel also makes laptop music using a guitar, though I would describe his work as organic but not
    necessarily human. The microscopic detail of Heckel's thin, shifting drones obscures their guitar origins. On ""Whirr"" it's easy to hear his signature
    trebly sound, which reminds me of the summer buzz of a cicada, but then Fonica blend this digital insect chorus with an evocative guitar melody and
    a bubbly layer of bass. The simple string elements bring the drone much closer to pop, though it could also be argued that it evokes post-rock of
    the Mice Parade variety. Either way, ""Whirr"" is absolutely gorgeous.</p><p>
    Elsewhere Fonica evoke a Childisc-like simplicity. ""Fluid"" is just a wispy music-box melody that sounds like a feather being dragged along a toy
    keyboard. ""Coda"" takes a few acoustic guitar strums and harmonics, chops them up, and layers in some subtle electronic accents. This track and the
    closing ""Zephyr"" remind me a lot of Greg Davis' <i>Arbor</i>, where the laptop can be switched off at any moment to showcase the rich and complex
    sonic properties of plucked steel strings. <i>Ripple</i> is a wonderfully satisfying and succinct little record, a beautiful synthesis of guitar and
    electronics.</p></div>"|3262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3262-ripple/|8.3|Mark Richardson

High-pitched, fevered chirping about garage rock revivals  and Jack White's pants ensued; bands started casually citing the MC5 and the Electric Prunes as super-super-influential.  We talked  about Sweden; we whispered about Detroit. We dreamt about the second coming of Paul Revere.</p><p>  Mid-2003: revival hyperbole has settled down, Swede-mania has long collapsed.  But Caesars (also known as Caesars Palace-- or  to Scandinavians  as the Twelve Caesars, a previous tag) are poised for their very own eye-opening stateside permeation, as Astralwerks perplexingly releases <i>39 Minutes of Bliss (In An  Otherwise Meaningless World)</i>, a pieced-together singles package masquerading as an album (tracks were culled from Caesars' 1998  debut and a handful of subsequently released EPs); it functions for the most part  as the thumping ""garage rock"" soundtrack to a bunch of  goofy beer commercials.  Curiously, a forty-five second advertisement featuring a troop of lovely twenty-somethings  provocatively sashaying through a flooded, soapy laundry room seems like the appropriate venue for Caesars' entirely artificial, smooth- but-empty product.  It's just as believable.</p><p>   With their rousing mod riffs and ample percussion, Caesars' Kinks-ish (circa <i>Village Green</i>) retro-jams are palatable enough (and  certainly catchy enough) for modern rock radio, but they're also studio-polished to the point of becoming impenetrable; the  tunes themselves are a predictable blend of spent Brit pop (half these tracks play like flimsy Oasis B-sides) and gooey American lite  rock.  Opener ""Sort It Out"" boasts wildly meaningless lyrics (""I wanna smoke crack/ Cause you're never coming back/ I wanna sniff  glue/ Cause I can't get over you""); they have the potential to be sorta...charmingly asinine, until the relentlessly thick electric  guitar and simpering pseudo-Doors organ lines suck all the fun out, coating everything in Smashmouth goo.</p><p>  The possibility of squeezing a good snicker from <i>39 Minutes</i>' brazen anti-poetics wanes fast: ""(I'm Gonna) Kick You Out"" nobly  offers, ""I'm a man with a fork/ In a world of soup,"" but it's already too late to hope for prize-winning lyrics from the  vacant, mechanical instrumentation (relentless guitar, plodding bass) that makes up the song.  Frontman Cesar Vidal has  perfected the smug, nasal moan and polished posturing of his white-belted countrymen, but his snotty yelp is so flat and hollow that  it barely qualifies as a credible whine-- by the time <i>39 Minutes</i> reaches the droned-out ""Suzy Creamcheese"", it's hard to even dig up  a half-assed grin for the title. </p><p> 
    Caesars have managed only to co-opt the self-satisfied smirk of rock 'n' roll.  Their promise of bliss is about as  viable as the beer commercials this record is presently being used to sell, but not nearly as fun or mercifully fleeting.</p></div>"|1713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1713-39-minutes-of-bliss-in-an-otherwise-meaningless-world/|3.9|Amanda Petrusich

    prom. The band's U.S. crossover success didn't come until their sixth album, by which time its more creative juices had stopped flowing. So like Adam and the Ants, the Human League,
    and Dexy's Midnight Runners, among others, their homeland success and spirit of experimentation has been erased from U.S. music discourse in favor of hegemonic assumptions and lazy potshots.</p><p>
    With that in mind, I was almost as much surprised as I was pleased to learn that Virgin bothered to release reissues of OMD's first three albums in America. But with the indie
    calendar turned back 20 years, it almost makes sense, and who knows: maybe once the embers of post-punk are fully explored and its rigid dance moves are all perfected, a synth-pop revival is
    next. The Human League got their well-deserved due earlier in the year with reissues of their three most vital records-- augmented by bonus tracks-- and now OMD's peak years get the
    same treatment.</p><p>
    In its earliest guises, the Liverpudlian group's only connection to American hits such as ""If You Leave"" and ""So In Love"" were the dramatic vocals of co-founder Andy McCluskey. He, along
    with fellow multi-instrumentalist Paul Humphreys, wrote and recorded songs throughout the late 70s, the best of which were compiled for their 1980 self-titled debut. Because it's a
    series of tracks written both over a long period of time and before they'd hit upon an original voice, <em>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark</em> does at some points seem like an artful
    pastiche of overground electronic influences. If you're more of the cup-is-half-full type, however, you might consider it their most varied effort, but either way, <em>OMD</em>'s adventurous blend of
    drama and pathos-- and its nods toward the more rhythmic end of Krautrock-- elevated them above the Eno/Kraftwerk template clung to by many of their peers.
    </p><p>
<em>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark</em>'s original release was highlighted by the exquisite ""Electricity"" (here also joined by the slightly inferior yet eye-catching Martin Hannett mix) and the
    brooding ""The Messerschmit Twins"", but the reissue's coup is the single mix of ""Messages"". The band's commercial breakthrough, the elegant ""Messages"" stands out next to the
    record's often sparse, minimalist soundscapes. 
    </p>
<p>
    OMD's second LP <em>Organisation</em> was hastily released six months later, and it sure sounds like it. Typically, a sophomore rush job means a band is cowardly-- quickly rolling
    out more of the same-- or taking a wide-eyed bid at chart stardom. For OMD, it meant recoiling from the spotlight, regrouping to make a willfully dark album. If that was the goal, pre-album
    single ""Enola Gay"" did little to keep fame at arm's length. Despite the song's dreary subject matter (it's named for the plane that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima), its infectious,
    gurgling bounce and McCluskey's theatrical vocals make it one of synth-pop's peaks.
    </p>
<p>
    The remainder of the album is primarily hit-or-miss synth noir, an embrace of the Northern miserablism of fellow Liverpudlians Echo and Bunnymen and a homage to OMD's
    brief Factory Records roots. The addition of drummer Malcolm Holmes made this record more muscular than its predecessor, but its psuedo-Joy Division gothic leanings quickly wear
    thin. The bonus tracks are less valuable, too: b-side ""Annex"" is welcome, but the addition of a four-song instrumental EP is more a curio than a necessity.
    </p>
<p>
    OMD made a quick return to form, however, on their third album, 1981's <em>Architecture &amp; Morality</em>. Shaking off the dread of their music engaging with the public while simultaneously
    weathering critical scrutiny, OMD shows a greater facility for pop melody, crafting songs of aching fragility rather than off-putting gloom. Along with the Human League's <em>Dare</em>-- also
    initially released in 1981-- <em>Architecture &amp; Morality</em> is a bridge between synth-pop's more bleak, industrial beginnings and the shimmer and shine of ambitious New Pop. Lush
    ballads such as ""The Beginning and the End"" and ""Souvenir"" effortlessly cast aside OMD's final notions of Gary Numan-esque faux-robotics. After all, as ""Enola Gay"" hinted, technology
    sometimes had a devastating price.
    </p>
<p>
    Instead, here they explore the mechanics of the soul, again reaching into the past for inspiration, this time with four (yes, four) songs ""about"" Joan of Arc. OK, that seems a bit precious, but
    the teenage heroine trapped between duty and common sense, faith and delusion, and reality and virtual reality made for a poignant central metaphor for a band exploring the fragility and
    warmth of the heart with what is a stereotypically cold, even pragmatic sound. 
    </p>
<p>
    Even with the reissue's addition of some frequently bewitching B-sides, <em>Architecture &amp; Morality</em> retains a fairly even mood, one which is either a bore or something to cherish
    depending on one's willingness to be charmed by electronic lullabies of longing and poignancy. So while OMD's self-titled debut perhaps offers more to like, <em>Architecture &amp; Morality</em>
    is more frequently beloved and the closest the band ever came to making an essential record.

     ""CABARET VOLTAIRE SEEM TO INSPIRE EXTREME REACTIONS: ON THEIR FIRST GIG IN
    SEPT 1975, MAL GOT PULLED OFF STAGE DURING THEIR 2ND SET - THE GIG WAS
    TERMINATED AND  MAL WENT TO HOSPITAL... IN LONDON AT THE LYCEUM IN MARCH, THEY PLAY BOTTOM
     BILLED SUPPORT ON THE BUZZCOCKS TOUR - THEIR SET ENDS UNDER A HAIL OF
    FLYING  GLASSES (PLASTIC) AFTER FOUR NUMBERS...""</p><p>
    
    I really hope the folks tossing plastic at Cabaret Voltaire weren't Buzzcocks fans.  While a Buzzcocks song like ""Noise Annoys"" (in
    retrospect) merely talked the talk, Cabaret Voltaire's ""Nag Nag Nag"" actually <i>brought</i> the noise, sounding
     like a group of technologically poisoned construction workers banging out ""Louie Louie"" on bulldozers and 
     PVC tubes.  Times have changed, of course: after the Warp  and Hanson imprints-- and even Add N to (X)'s 
     namby-pamby electroshock therapy-- a passionless voice intoning ""Nag, nag, nag"" over what amounts to some
     ambient noise, two notes on a keyboard, and a drum machine isn't much to throw overpriced beer at.</p><p>
    
     Neither is this collection.  These 3 CDs compile sounds created by the CV collective prior to laying down, as Richard Kirk 
     (Guitar/ Synthesizer/Voice) words it in the nearly inscrutable liner notes (printed in silver ink on top of black &amp; white pictures-- striking, design-wise,
     but it isn't easy on the eyes): ""the tracks that first brought us to public attention.""  According to Kirk, the first 2 discs (featuring work from
    1974 through 1976) contain the components that would eventually coalesce into the  familiar work featured on the third disc: the aforementioned ""Nag Nag
    Nag"",  ""Baader Meinhof"", and ""Do the Mussolini (Headkick)"".  Not surprisingly, these little bits of familiarity are the dullest portion of this entire package; as
    the title of the box set suggests, the purpose of this collection is to detail the process by which Cabaret Voltaire found their way.  In this light, the
     journey's destination doesn't amount to much.</p><p>
    
     Over the course of listening to these tracks, it might strike you that Cabaret Voltaire discovered themselves the way many an artist gains their
    sea legs: by fucking around.  Try something different, fall flat on your face, try something else, repeat ad infinitum.  In the liner notes, Kirk notes
     (rightly) that the presence of punk rock makes itself known in these demos  through the use of guitar.  It's this overt attempt to ""rock"" in any
    fashion, the capitulation to pop songwriting, that makes the known tracks dull.</p><p>
    
    Even their respectfully disrespectful cover of the Velvet Underground's ""Here She Comes Now"" sounds too obvious,  though CV do their best, approximating the rhythm of the
    original, strumming some chords that might be right, and stabbing the keyboard ""96 Tears"" style while laying down sepulchral vocals to lend a watered-down Joy Division
    air.  They do manage to get their VU adulation right in some respects, one-upping the spoken-word shtick of ""The Gift"" and ""Murder Mystery"" with the ominous narration of 
    ""Data Processing Instructions"" and ""Bedtime Stories"".</p><p>
    
    The best of these tracks eschew punk rock trappings (e.g. the type of guitar-based stuff the Buzzcocks et. al. are known for) in favor of
    embracing the idyllic punk rock ideology of doing your own damn thing.  For the Cabaret Voltaire recording in that attic in the mid-70s, that meant making noises
    like the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, best known for the <i>Dr. Who</i> theme.  ""Synthi Aks Piece Two"" and ""Henderson Reversed Piece Two"" certainly
    recall the haunting moods offered by Brian Eno's ambient material, if not the actual sounds.   Elsewhere, excursions into musique concrete collide with formal
     experiments.  The ""Treated Guitar"" sounds like an overweight bass; the ""Treated Clarinet"" resembles a harmonica; the ""Treated Drum Machine"", a metallic
    cuckoo clock.  ""Jive"" turns out to be a fair approximation of some sort of dubby funk (as essayed by wooden spoon beats and something that sounds like a
    electric Jew's Harp).   And, of course, befitting the punk rock spirit of all this work, ""The Single"" is doo-wop (accompanied by suitably hokey lyrics and a few synth

     Naysayers will gladly pounce on the first track of Disc 3 as the epithet for this collection: ""It's Not Music"".  Of course, even Pizzicato Five fans
    know that music is organized sound-- it's just a matter of what level of organization you're willing to recognize.  The band as represented in <i>Methodology</i> seem
    to recognize patterns that many of the great unwashed were unwilling, or incapable, of discerning.  In many ways, the many moods offered in these demos
    surpasses the comparatively heavy-handed paranoid rebellious slop they doled out via Rough Trade and other record companies. Perhaps those fans in 1978 were right to
    throw things at the group when they opened for the Buzzcocks-- after hearing these attic tapes, who the hell would willfully put up with more nagging?</p></div>"|1211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1211-methodology-7478-attic-tapes/|8.6|David Raposa

<i>""I'm a vegetarian/ Humanitarian/ Imaginarian [sic]/ I'm a Libertarian/ The country's getting ugly and
    there's more in store/ But don't blame me 'cause I voted for Gore.""</i></p><p>
    
    Holy shit, it finally happened.  Welcome to hip-hop as a vessel for smug, middlebrow liberal condescension.
    Meet Northern State: a merry troika of young Long Islanders who rap about Bush and <i>Fast Food Nation</i>
    on their debut mini-album, <i>Dying in Stereo</i>.  But first-- since I'm going to be tackling the doubly
    touchy subject of white female artists working in a black male milieu-- I'll need to lay down some ground
    rules.  First: for the purposes of this review, there is no such thing as ""white"" or ""black"" hip-hop.
    We'll use class definitions instead.  Second: For the sake of my inbox, let's dispense with the girl factor--
    the crew's gender matters only because it triggers 99% of the praise that's heaped on them (and I swear,
    people, somewhere out there is a group of girls even more talented than underground hip-hop's current
    leading lady, Jean Grae), and allows wanting critics an opportunity to finally champion <i>somebody</i> as
    the antidote to rap's misogyny, as if a group of haughty correctives from suburbia could somehow trump--
    or even start a meaningful dialogue with-- the inner city.</p><p>
    
    Armed with the weakest flow in town, squeaky Amy Fisher accents, and a stultifying, wrongheaded sense of
    entitlement, Hesta Prynn and pals have created what must be the most heinous hip-hop release since MC Skat
    Kat went solo.  Clearly children of privilege, Northern State commit the terrible fallacy of co-opting
    street argot-- something that grad-school rappers like MC Paul Barman and Princess Superstar, whatever
    their shortcomings, wisely avoid.  <i>Dying in Stereo</i> is peppered with yo's and aight's delivered in
    a giddy yet suspiciously ironic fashion; the falseness is soul-rending.  Northern State sound like suburban
    brats playing with Ghetto Barbies.</p><p>
    
    It's even more worrying, then, that <i>Dying in Stereo</i> displays no knowledge of hip-hop history
    whatsoever.  Judging from the evidence presented, Northern State base their understanding of the genre
    entirely on the Beastie Boys.  Their collective sound mimics the Beasties' dynamic (the high-voiced one,
    the low-voiced one and the raspy too-many-Marlboro-Lights one), down to their tendency to rap in the
    familiar cadences that overstress the last syllable (you know: ""I'll rock this party like a de-bu-TANTE!"").</p><p>
    
    It's rare that an album is rendered fully unsalvageable halfway through the first verse of the opening
    track, but that is precisely what happens on ""A Thousand Words"", when one of these Long Island lolitas
    utters, ""I'm lean/ I'm mean/ I'm clean/ I'm not 17."" (There goes a good excuse; the crew are in their
    20s.)  Disturbingly, <i>Village Voice</i> critic Robert Christgau, exhibiting distinctly lecherous
    tendencies in his old age, hailed the track's money line (that one about voting for Gore) as a gem. It
    ought to be said that most of the glowing critical ink lavished on Northern State squirts from Christgau's
    pen: <i>Voice</i> coverage aside, it was he who gave the trio's home demo a four-star review in <i>Rolling
    Stone</i>, setting them firmly on track to a recent deal with Columbia.</p><p>
    
    Beatwise, the album is bland and fey, with no low-end or hooks to speak of.  The third track, ""At the
    Party"", distinguishes itself by trying on a sort of Fisher-Price metal riff, then abruptly abandoning it.
    The lyrical nadir, however, has yet to be reached: Save your projectile vomit for the penultimate song,
    ""All the Same"", in which Northern State deign to explain their mission:</p><p>
<i>""All we can do is try/ To speak for the people who haven't any voices/ And feel for the women who haven't
    any choices.""</i></p><p>
    
    The group's bravery is duly noted-- all that pro-life hip-hop's gotta go!-- but the fact that Northern State
    believe themselves to be in the business of empowerment is unconscionable.  Juvenile, simpering, weak,
    preachy, pointless and accidentally snooty, <i>Dying in Stereo</i> is about as empowering as <i>Legally
    Blonde 2</i>, and half as clever.</p></div>"|5841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5841-dying-in-stereo/|0.8|Michael Idov

Every time the song 
    faded, I placed the needle back in the starting groove and waited for the tentative drones to begin again. The Swans' bleak eulogizing mixed perfectly 
    with the snow outside the station window, and I imagined passers-by who could hear were realizing we'd found the proper soundtrack to wait out the 
    winter, literally and figuratively: ""When, when we were young/ We had no history/ So nothing to lose/ Meant we could choose/ Choose what we wanted 
    then/ Without any fear/ Or thought of revenge/ But then you grew old/ And I lost my ambition."" In actuality it's a more temperate song, set to the 
    dusty alcoholism of Malcolm Lowry's  <i>Under the Volcano</i>, and the snow...I was just being dramatic. But Swans-- for all their bombast-- avoided 
    succumbing to the same high-school theatrics during their band's fifteen year existence, contrary to what you might 
    have been told.</p><p>
    
    Formed in 1982 and fronted by vocalist and guitarist Michael Gira (currently busying himself with Angels of Light and Young God Records), Swans 
    included a revolving cast of unrelentingly deft and like-minded downtown players, most significantly vocalist/keyboardist Jarboe, who's 
    pitch-clear voice contrasted diabolically with Gira's deeper-than-hell bellow. Perhaps because of his fire and brimstone intonation-- which makes 
    Ian Curtis sound like a pistol-whipped soprano-- Swans were often pigeonholed as a too-dark, almost laughable gothic experiment. The 
    assessment is reductive and tone-deaf: at their best, Swans seamlessly layered no-wave and heavyweight industrial pounding with streams 
    of erudite Middle-Eastern drones, drop tuning, monolithic sheets of noise, harrowing, force-fed dynamics, and gorgeously lilting strings and acoustic 
    guitars. Add to this adventurousness Gira's dark tales of warped love, lusty damnation, torturous addiction, and soul-sickened existentialism and you've 
    got yourself one of the more interesting musical takes on the underbelly of human nature to crop up in the last two decades.</p><p>
    
    Most of the band's work went rapidly out of print, but Gira has graciously remastered and reissued much of it on Young God. The blistering <i>Children of 
    God</i>, for example, was originally released in 1987 and reissued ten years later as a double CD with <i>World of Skin</i>, a compilation of tracks from Skin, 
    a Gira/Jarboe collaboration focused more on Jarboe's ethereality. <i>World of Skin</i> compiles <i>Blood, Women, Roses</i> (1987) and <i>Shame, Humility, Revenge</i> 
    (1988), albums from the same time period as <i>Children of God</i> (1987).</p><p>
<i>Children of God</i>, one of the band's strongest releases, established Gira as an Old Testament tyrant obsessed with the nature of love, human frailty, and 
    the midnight beauty of black orchids. Much of Swans' earliest work on <i>Filth</i> and <i>Young God</i> found the band fixating on single beats in a brutally 
    sweeping, industrial cacophony, in many ways the realization of the theories of the Futurists. Later, with the addition of Jarboe, Gira brought more 
    varied sounds into the mix, melding hooks and spatial variation to the unwavering rhythms. <i>Children of God</i> stands as a solid example of this 
    transition: the maniacally heavy drone of the album's opener, ""New Mind"" gives way to the fragility of Jarboe's  ""In My Garden"". This is one of a 
    dozen wonderful juxtapositions here; in its expansiveness, <i>Children of God</i> brings to mind disparate touchstones: Joy Division's 
    factory-worker melancholy, more elaborately atmospheric Black Metal bands like Emperor who deal in swirling beauty and intensity, Big Black for pure 
    aggression, and old-time softness of traditional folk.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Children of God</i>, Gira's brief lyrical declarations have also begun to  evolve into a larger sense of storytelling (he in fact published a hypnotic collection 
    of Gothic short tales, <i>The Consumer</i>, on Henry Rollins' imprint 2.13.61 in 1996). On later recordings like <i>The Burning World</i> (1988), the details of the 
    prose equaled the atmosphere evoked within the music.</p><p>
<i>World of Skin</i> is less accomplished, its quiet introspection lacks the maniacal propulsiveness of Swans. On the plus side, tracks like 
    ""Breathing Water"" and ""One Small Sacrifice"" anticipate Gira's later work with Angels of Light, albeit in a more skeletal, funereal form. Here, 
    though, Jarboe's vocalizing often errs on the side of the new age: her interpretation of ""Cry Me a River"" is static (to be fair, Gira's remake of 
    ""I Want To Be Your Dog"" is equally ho-hum) and ""We'll Fall Apart"" sounds like the precursor to some hopelessly lightweight Sarah McLaughlin's 
    malaise. On the other hand, ""Blood on Your Hands"" is a lovely dark-night spiritual harmonized by Jarboe and other singers. This track also shows up 
    on <i>The Swans Are Dead</i>, a mind-blowing documentation of their final world tours of 1995 and 1997. Live,  it grows into a sinister solo alto with a 
    slight drone humming and other ambient noise in the background.</p><p>
    
    Despite the misfires on <i>World of Skin</i>, to experience these carefully paired documents as a singularity is an intense study in contrasts and linkages as 
    well as a compelling look at a particularly fruitful moment in the development of one of America's more ecstatically uncompromising, 
    idiosyncratic, and sadly overlooked composers.</p></div>"|7646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7646-children-of-god/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

    Languidly moving from one mid-tempo tune to the next, it's an album that has no surprises and better yet, no indulgences-- just a remarkably consistent debut showcasing 
    tuneful alt.country.</p><p>
    
    Jason Lakis (ex-Half Film) fronts this Oakland-based act, contributing vocals and guitar; he formed the quartet with members of San Francisco's The Inspectors. They clicked right away, 
    with rough guitar riffs and an impeccable rhythm section.  Lakis' languorous pedal steel dominates every track it appears on, especially the opener ""Spread Thin"", but never 
    detracts from how beautifully it blends with Daryle Goldbar's guitar and Wurlitzer, nor how smoothly it rides the crisp rhythm section.</p><p> 
    
    Lakis also writes all the songs, which are as tasteful as the band's sound: the easy melody of ""Spread Thin"", the riffs of ""Subject to Change"" and the series of great choruses all 
    get better with every listen.  The only cover song-- Bad Brains' ""Sailin' On""-- could have been just a ""punk meets country"" novelty track, but the Red Thread perform it as naturally 
    as if they'd written it themselves; Lakis pairs it with the album's only other rocker ""All In"" before reverting to mid-tempo ballads.  These guys are lovers, not fighters.</p><p> 
    
    As might be expected, the record's steady pace reveals its shortcomings.  Even the engrossing ballads are steady and distant; ""Borrow and Spend"" digs the deepest, even though it seems to 
    need more-- more gutbucket vocals, or another wrap-up verse.  Song after song, Lakis plays it cool, and it wouldn't even be a problem if it didn't highlight what's wrong with 
    Lakis as a singer: we don't get enough of him.</p><p> 
    
    Lakis has a smooth, masculine croon with a languid delivery and a touch of husk, the sound of a guy the men can drink with, and the women can giggle over.  A random 
    survey of nine out of ten female listeners would like to hear more of him, and maybe check out his butt, yet Lakis sits in the middle of the band rather than wearing his 
    appeal like a pair of jeans.  His vocals hang back-- he keeps his delivery consistent, and his voice mixed too low. </p><p> 
    
    That may explain why this is a solid but not striking debut.  The band hits its stride right away, and the songwriting is above average-- even the instrumental coda ""Details"", 
    which could easily have sounded half-baked, flows perfectly to close out the record.  Lakis and company hit the mark again and again, but it seems all too easy.  By album's end 
    you're already hoping they push into riskier territory the next time out. </p></div>"|6729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6729-after-the-last/|7.3|Chris Dahlen

As if to accent the comment, she made a sweeping motion across her brow with one hand-- wiping away 
    invisible sweat-- while the other deftly locked itself around the steering wheel.  Agitated-- she knew I was being forced to see a band I had no true interest in-- there was 
    surprisingly little hesitation in her voice when she asked, ""Didn't you enjoy it?""</p><p>
    
    Its not as if The Dandy Warhols and I have any bad blood between us, but my previous exposures to the band have been sordid to say the very least.  True, I met my significant other 
    and eternal concert partner while absentmindedly reviewing <i>Thirteen Tales of Urban Bohemia</i> for my college radio station-- her noticing the empty jewel-case beside my bag 
    and inquisitively approaching me as I listened-- but those tunes have waned appreciably over the years, turning balanced neutrality into mild disparity 
    at the mere mention of Courtney Taylor's troupe.  Add to this sentimental nostalgia my recent concert attendance, and my initially lukewarm feelings of distaste mutate into venomous 
    and irascible abhorrence.  Petty as it may be, I fully admit that I am not above disliking a band based solely on the fact that they cater to my fears of inadequacy as a male and 
    mate.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the only reason I mention this is to caution the patient reader against lambasting my opinion of <i>Welcome To The Monkey House</i> based solely upon the above numerical 
    rating and any personal adherence one may have to Dandy-ism.  While it's true that I hold damning grudges against some musicians for no other reason than misdirected 
    machismo (guilty feelings? mere jealousy?), I would never pan the actual music if it fairly displayed some amount of talented songwriting and quality.  To wit, I would sooner punch 
    every member of the Saddle Creek family in the nose-- barring The Faint and Now It's Overhead-- than shake their hands or say hello, yet I continue to surreptitiously purchase and 
    endorse every recent Bright Eyes release.  Thus, believe the heart of this kindred music-lover when I state that <i>Monkey House</i> is comparable to and nearly as enjoyable as a 
    pelvic exam with chilled instruments-- seemingly fun, but shaky and ill-advised.</p><p>
    
    Beginning on a warble-- the sound of Courtney Taylor's tongue drilling directly through his cheek-- the title track is a short and typical Warhols' sound that pokes fun at the 
    fabric of pop-culture while simultaneously unraveling it.  Flippantly spouting off lines such as ""When Michael Jackson dies/ We're covering Blackbird"" would be laughable and 
    forgiveable if delivered over any accompaniment other than the dry and clipping electric guitar line that the group pounds out for the song's brief temporal existence.  Partly redeeming 
    is the transition into ""We Used To Be Friends"", a track that fully exhibits the aided production by Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran-fame.  On it, one can hear the warm synthesizers-- otherwise 
    known as Dandy's flavor-of-the-month-- replacing nearly all traces of the guitar in the group's sound, as Taylor pinches his prostrate in some unsettling, yet strangely alluring falsetto 
    vocalizations.</p><p>
    
    A comfortable furniture-filled-room production leaks into ""Plan A"", a track that sports another D2-member, Simon Le Bon, on back-up vocals.  Musical influences and heart vying for 
    equal space on the band's sleeve, the song is catchy enough with a unique sonic layering of acoustic and electronically derived sounds, but suffers for its inability to let go-- the chorus 
    of ""all of us, sing about it"" suffering well past its time of captivation or interest.  Similar tracks-- ""Insincere Because I"", ""Heavenly"", and the morose ""You Came In Burned""-- suffer the 
    same fate, drawing out tunes that couldn't hold anyone's attention for thirty seconds, much less beyond the five minute mark.</p><p>
    
    Not content with their own lackluster tune, ""I Am A Scientist"" drags one of Robert Pollard's best songs through the mud, the band 
    hijakcing the experience of Chic guitarist/producer Nile Rodgers in the process.  Preaching atop an empty pulpit, Courtney drops ironic faux-pedagogic phobias such as ""I try to live on science 
    alone"" and ""I tell you what, mathematically I'm happening,"" before plunging into another hard-beat/fuzzy-bass loop that ends on a whimper of instrumental ornamentation.  Equally 
    predictable: the slight-guitar return of ""I Am Over It"", the Tony Visconti-produced and T. Rex/Bowie aped ""Hit Rock Bottom"" and ""The Dope"", and the slower jangle-pop genesis of 
    ""I Am Sound"".</p><p>
    
    A bright spot amongst the tarnish is the Evan Dando co-write ""You Were The Last High"", the song that undoubtedly gets the group another quarter of a million records sold-- 
    the A-Ha influenced composition that will cause phone company executives' ears to perk up in advertisement bliss.  Alternately sounding like the 
    mix-tape song of choice for your average sixteen year-old girl in the throes of first-luv or a Jarvis Cocker solo release, ""The Dandy Warhols Love Everyone"" rounds us out 
    as best as can be expected-- doo-doo's and wah-ooo-oooh's augmented by electronic beats and a twice-bitten fuzzy bass line.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, these songs highlight the poseur mentality and insincerity that paradoxically plagues and blesses The Dandy Warhols-- one side of the coin endowing them with 
    innocent condescension of their musical roots, the other holding them accountable for their acoustic laziness in the face of so much potential.  The decision rests solely with the band 
    now as to whether future releases will make good on this latent talent, or whether they will continue to rely upon breathy sighs, the crowd-pleasing rush of hedonistic pleasure, and the 
    infidelity of exposed nipples.</p></div>"|2162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2162-welcome-to-the-monkey-house/|3.3|Andrew Bryant

    the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' body of work (repetitive arrangements in Nick Zinner's less-inspired moments, Karen's
    play-acting testing the limits of endurance), the results are staggering when they bring the full weight of
    their collective abilities to bear.  Between Zinner's cutting drones, Chase's lurking rhythms, and Karen's
    (like it or not) ability to grab a listener's, uh, attention, the YYY's at their best sound less like a
    sleazy three-piece and more like a relentless troop battling from trenches.  ""Rich"", ""Y Control"", and most
    of all the flawless mixture of vitriol and vulnerability in ""Maps"" are their crowning achievements, and they
    can release singles until the wheel of fashion finally turns and strands them at the Salvation Army, but if
    they don't single out any of these songs, they're missing the point.</p><p>
    
    We should all be thankful for small favors, though, as ""Pin"" at least manages to convey a fraction of the
    overwhelming force they have at their disposal.  What it lacks in the drag-strip dynamics and pacing of
    ""Date with the Night"" it compensates for with a brooding ebb and flow; stilted treble chords give way to a
    thunderous crash distortion, but that tidal rush is back to sea before the next verse, only to repeat the
    cycle one more time.  The lyrics imply gritty urbanity, but only in shadowy terms: ""Things are feeling thin,""
    sings Karen over the tense, skeletal accompaniment, giving ""Pin"" an appropriately half-hearted, world-weary
    sound.  It's not a frequent pose, but it's every bit as attractive as the bedroom antics Karen typically
    adopts, and more impressive for its relative rarity.  ""I like to sleep with them/ I know, I know.""  Yeah,
    Karen, so do we.</p><p>
    
    Even if ""Pin"" doesn't quite encapsulate the sheer power the band has at their disposal, there's also a video
    for it, so that's something, right?  Who wouldn't want to see that?  I sure as shit wouldn't not want to, but
    my computer choked to death on what's allegedly a ""creepy"", ""Quay Brothers-inspired"" piece of rock action,
    and despite all my protestations to the contrary, this pile of circuits (that's charitably one step removed
    from an Etch-a-Sketch) just wasn't having it.  All I got were occasional still-frames as Karen O ""goes back
    in"" to a door, turns into an action figure of some sort, gets pins stuck in her (clever); the slide-show
    presentation I got made it into the worst stop-motion video ever, though, so I can't comment.  It's just a
    video, it shouldn't take much firepower to dazzle my senses with Karen's trip through the looking glass,
    should it?  Maybe if this machine was actually a multi-million dollar supercomputer that was just pretending
    to be obsolete, it would've run properly...</p><p>
    
    Wiat what?  Was that a dig at the Yeah Yeah Yeahs?  Just a little, but hell, my temporary case of techno-envy
    makes me want to tear up my trucker's cap in bitter defeat.  What can I say?  So no in-depth symbolism analysis,
    no talk of Christ-analogs or phallic portrayals, folks; I'm as disappointed as you are, but just remember that
    whatever I say here about the music (the meat of any album), the disc also includes a video (the gristle).  I
    hear it's good.  It'd better be, too, because when you come right down to it, the meat of this thing is only
    fair.  ""Pin""'s qualified strengths aside, the unmistakable failing of this EP remains that the YYY's seemingly
    have yet to realize where their strengths lie as a band-- and for a group with so much potential, it's
    infuriating to witness yet another wrong turn.</p><p>
    
    Yet, somehow, the YYY's continue to surprise me; they steer into the skid and end up in totally foreign
    territory.  The last time they tried to navigate the sticky terrain of ""experimental"" mixes (with a fuzzy,
    indistinct rendering of ""Pin"", no less) on the disastrous <i>Machine</i> EP, they seemed hopelessly lost;
    it's a wonder they made it back in time to record their album.  If the B-sides of this single shows anything,
    though, it's that they learned from their mistakes.  The ""Pandaworksforthecops"" remix of ""Rich"" crosses the
    haunting harmonic backing of the original with ""Jingle Bells"" and a drummers convention; while Nick and Karen
    overdose on valium, Brian pulls out all the percussive stops-- bells that are singularly disconcerting in
    their monotony, an overpowering drum loop, and ghostly stick clattering in the background-- running roughshod
    over mumbled lyrics and faintly plucked strings.</p><p>
    
    Only hypnotic whole tones reminiscent of the original keep it recognizable as anything other than a totally
    new composition, but its brilliant bleakness only serves to clear the set for baffling, if weirdly impressive,
    finale: a cover of Liars' ""Mr. You're on Fire, Mr.""  I'll concede this: in simple, broad strokes, the YYY's
    have managed to cover Liars in a way that band would surely be proud of; everything outside of the most
    explicit defining characteristics of the original, the rawest of the raw essentials, is hollowed out and
    discarded.  Zinner's guitar is distorted to lifeless tones, Chase provides nothing beyond a lone snare hit
    in terrifying rhythm to pace the track, and the lyrics are beyond indecipherable, Karen's voice barely more
    than a distorted, lazy shriek through the course of the song.</p><p>
    
    It's utterly pulseless: a draining, yawning void in place of Liars' tightly wound dance-punk mania, and in
    some ways, it's incredibly smart.  Nothing could be closer in spirit to the Liars' ever-present desire to
    stay one step ahead of expectations, even if it's not an easy thing to take in and of itself.  Just when it
    seemed like the YYY's could still be nothing but a talented one-trick pony (and luckily for all involved),
    they demonstrate some unexpected depth beyond even the beauty of ""Maps"".  The B-sides of this single carry
    the day, actually building on the off-kilter rock of ""Pin"", turning the jittery, brittle nerves to some
    good use after all.  Now the real is question is not whether they can learn from past errors, but current
    successes, and that remains to be seen; after all, even a one trick pony can get lucky.</p></div>"|8886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8886-pin-ep/|6.8|Eric Carr

Sometimes,
    letting go is the easiest way to get your grip, and as any traveler will tell you, getting there is almost all of the fun.  Get it?  Unless you're
    completely wasted, probably not-- this is the crux of stoner wisdom, wherein often you're the only one who knows that you're right.  Maybe that's why
    music made under these circumstances is usually so out there.  It probably made sense at the time for Tim Leary and Manuel Gottsching to make all those
    strange sounds, but to the indifferent observer they are something else altogether.  This isn't to say chemically enhanced music only
    makes sense to the tuned in and turned on, but I'd argue it's probably much easier to find common ground when you're high.</p><p>
    
    Enter Finland's Pharaoh Overlord, a project led by guitarist Jussi Lehtisalo of Circle, themselves good for a lengthy excursion or three into outer
    space.  The flavor on their second release is decidedly passive where Circle are prone to brute force.  Rather than concoct trance via mere repetition,
    Pharaoh Overlord realize that the quickest way to a sedated heart is to ease in gradually, massaging all the rough edges away and keeping the traveler
    effortlessly afloat.  Fuck, more herb nonsense-- anyway, you probably get the idea.  If not, may I suggest that these guys come off like an intensely
    comfortable version of Acid Mothers Temple, minus all that guitar squealing nonsense.  For the straight-edgers in the audience, just consider it the
    next best thing to warm milk before bed.</p><p>
    
    ""Komaron Runner"" wastes little time establishing the mildly disorientating quease-trance that Pharaoh Overlord specialize in.  A gauze of distant,
    howling breeze covers the minimal guitar-bass-drums vamp like a layer of heavy white smoke.  The sound approaches lo-fi even as the layers of soft
    noise build, giving the tune an ominous, hazy depth.  The band play everything pretty slow, and prefer extremely minor variations on the same
    basic riff played continuously, rather than muck up the mix with extraneous ""psychedelic"" effects (Cotton Casino, I'm looking in your direction).
    Likewise, ""Dark Temper"" wrings plenty of mileage out of its snaky, pseudo-blues thang using little more than that same smoggy veneer and
    surprisingly subtle guitar figures.  The end result is like a younger cousin to Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold"" crossed with Funkadelic's ""Music for Your
    Mother"", but with no vocals, you're free to follow your own narrative.</p><p>
    
    Slightly less engaging is ""Skyline"", if only because it tends to follow the more obvious path to bliss via mind-numbing repetition.  There's a good
    chance you'll have the main riff from this tune permanently ingrained after hearing it a few times-- whether or not that translates to ever wanting to
    play it again depends on your affinity for pre-school blues riffery (and general level of patience).  ""August"" and ""Love Unfiltered"" opt for acoustic
    textures, though not at the expense of the already well-stated preference for sludgy garage rock grooves.  The former tune is almost folky, with a
    dual finger picked guitar attack, good for back porch revelations on a dead-hot summer evening.  The latter is more overtly spacey, though in
    truth, the differences between these two songs (and much of the album) might well come down to how willing you are to be hypnotized: waiting for
    ""something"" to happen is probably beside the point.</p><p>
<i>II</i> won't change the face of rock, or even psyche-rock.  There are literally hundreds of albums from the late 60s and early 70s out
    there that will do a similar trick, though I suppose if you aren't willing to scour eBay like greasy collector scum, Pharaoh Overlord can provide a
    valuable service at a fraction of the price.  Like any decent trip, this music will serve you best when you've cleared your mind, sat back and
    accepted that you aren't going anywhere beyond the bizarre corridors of your mind.  Motherfucker, I just lapsed into that shit again!  Anyway...you know
    what I'm talkin' about, man.</p></div>"|6260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6260-ii/|7.0|Dominique Leone

Norris is probably out for a stroll, right around 7:30 in the PM, breathing deeply and
    	keeping the pace relaxed. He's stocking up on pillows and Swedish furniture, and sleeping in late. Taking it easy.</p><p>
    
    	And rightfully so. Despite scores of brilliant records, from his 12"" releases on Clear to seminal albums like <i>Spook Tinsel Shoal</i> and the flawless diamond that is the <i>Neo Ouija</i>
    	LP, Norris has remained just this side of the spotlight, IDM's best kept secret or beautiful albino in guarded seclusion. In that time he's harvested a crop of like-minded knob-twiddlers
    	for his Neo Ouija label roster, and kept his sound evolving. Although he thinks of some of that early Metamatics catalog as dated (Lee, believe me, it ain't so), a surprising number of
    	elements from previous Norris records still crop up on 2002's <i>From Death to Passwords Where You're A Paper Aeroplane</i>, a subdued album that finds the heavy dance DNA of
    	<i>Dope for the Robot</i> and <i>Neo Ouija</i> turned down to a whisper.</p><p>
    
    	The beats are still there, mind you: Norris pretty much defines the mid-to-late 90s IDM sound, layering skittering loops over skittering loops till the whole thing crackles like the most
    	beautiful sandpaper, and <i>From Death To Passwords</i> cuts like ""Machine Wool"" and ""Colmic Zeus"" are rife with them. ""Remip Ear"" even sneaks a little booty bounce into the bass track,
    	but the sunlit atmosphere that rolls over top of it eskews the funk. What you'll find on the new album is that the Metamatics sound has expanded to include more forays into ambient
    	territory, a rich sense of ghost melody that permeated the best tracks on <i>Neo Ouija</i> (and if you're asking me, those would be ""So Many Ways"" and the title track in particular), and is
    	fleshed out even more so on <i>Passwords</i>. ""Giant Sunflowers Swaying In The Breeze"" has a thick synth hook, with beat textures inspired by his ""Man-Q-Neons"" single
    	on Dot Recordings, best described as house music filtered through the European countryside, preferably populated by healthy, blissed-out sheep. The IDM spirit is in full force on
    	""Byeway (Clan)"", but it's the chiming synth and extended musix box harmonies that make the track work, not the clicks and cuts snipping away behind them.</p><p>
    
    	""A New End"", in every way, is the culmination of this new curve in the Metamatics sinewave. Opening with translucent ambient washes and a spiraling laptop chirp, the song ebbs
    	and crests in an easy rhythm, evoking a calm and meditative void at once melancholy and crystalline, the quiet doldrums of a day spent inside; computer clicks try to put
    	the movements into context, but it's those first four minutes of digital mist that move you.  It swipes the blueprint for lovely from ""How I Missed You"" and takes it on a long sea cruise.
    	It's one of the most indelible soundscapes Norris has ever recorded, and solid evidence of musical growth. </p><p>
    
    	Norris' Metamatics material has always had heart, but on <i>From Death To Passwords</i>, the beats stay quiet long enough for you to hear it with more than your ears. The rhythm tracks
    	are still a thing of beauty, but they've graciously lowered their profile for a spell, and the countryside that lies beyond is worth a thousand ""Organic Healthy Robot""s-- maybe more. <i>Neo
    	Ouija</i> is still the pinnacle, but you can see this record from the summit. In less purple words: this isn't his best, but it's the next best thing. </p></div>"|5251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5251-from-death-to-passwords-where-youre-a-paper-aeroplane/|8.0|Mark Martelli

Hackneyed, overdone musical signifiers are easily and endlessly exploited, but it's often the most engaging and 
    memorable music that reminds us why these clichés exist in the first place, recreating them with spontaneity and sincerity.  When Summer Hymns released their 
    debut <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i> in 2000, there was no dearth of reasons to suspect contrived kitsch-- here was a band with the word ""Summer"" in their name, 
    releasing an album overrun with lazily-plucked banjos, transplanted back porch ambience, and hazy, ethereal vocals.  <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i> seemed so thematically 
    and musically whole that it was destined to be either a masterpiece or a bit of insubstantial fluff.  Thankfully, it fit quite comfortably into the first category, and still stands 
    as one of the most gorgeous, instantly accessible and compelling albums of the last several years.</p><p> 
    With the release of their third album <i>Clemency</i>, Summer Hymns once again find themselves skirting dangerous territory, as many of the musicians whose contributions 
    helped make 2001's <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i> such a rewarding follow-up have moved on, the hole created by their absence filled largely by oft-misused lap steel guitar 
    and the odd sample and drum machine beat.  Frontman Zachary Gresham once again proves remarkably adept at playing music that sounds perfectly suited 
    for itself, crafting a loose, country-tinged rock album that avoids both bar band mediocrity and shallow, overdetermined rootsiness.</p><p>
<i>Clemency</i> wastes no time establishing its sonic difference from the last two Summer Hymns records.  Gresham's voice is right at the front of the mix, its wavering, 
    awkward qualities now embraced rather than reverbed to oblivion.  Opener ""Be Anywhere"" places Gresham's voice atop a relatively skeletal arrangement of guitar, 
    drums, and glockenspiel, slowly building to a melancholy crescendo of slide guitar and harmony vocals.  Gresham's claim that ""I could be anyone with you"" oozes with 
    concurrent sweetness and sadness-- a moment of perfectly captured emotional complexity conveyed brilliantly through the newfound sonic lucidity of his voice.</p><p> 
    ""Upon Your Face"" works similarly, injecting the more upbeat songcraft of <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i> with an oddly unsettling brand of melancholy.  Throughout <i>Clemency</i>, 
    Gresham spikes mundane storytelling with moments of profound reflection, and his music follows suit; ""Upon Your Face"" alternates between a casual, relaxed groove and a chorus 
    so fluid and gripping it sounds like it's melting.  ""Cold Hamster"" rattles off child-like observations about life, death, and pets amidst a subtle harmonic interplay of guitar, bass, piano, 
    and electronics.  The brief ""I Erase"" is a dusty western ballad whose hero rides into town with the drum machine clapping of a digital horse, but it comes across as anything but a 
    gratuitous piece of genre-mashing.</p><p> 
    Though without a doubt a strong record, <i>Clemency</i> does have a few notable moments of weakness that render it less consistently gripping than its predecessors.  ""Pete Rose 
    Affinity"" is the ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" of the album, awkwardly telling a story in a way that comes across as relatively charming the first time, but fails to hold up.   The 
    barely-discernable vocal sample towards the middle of ""Wet Mess"" is a mere distraction-- a shame considering that the song builds to one of the most forceful, 
    rocking crescendos to be found on the album.  ""This Hip Hop"" takes the whole of its length to get anywhere close to convincing, even on repeated listens.</p><p> 
    A few missteps aside, <i>Clemency</i> is generally a consistent record-- if anything, a bit too consistent, as some of the shockingly successful experimentation of the last two Summer 
    Hymns records is sacrificed in favor of a more homogenous collection of songs.  Perhaps the addition of two full-time members who don't have to split time with other bands is 
    responsible for the more live band-like execution of <i>Clemency</i>.  And though it may not be quite as stunning as the previous Summer Hymns albums, you can't help but be drawn 
    in: like the albums that came before it, <i>Clemency</i> is a deep, rich, and profoundly engrossing listen, proving once again that, if used properly, the most familiar 
    sounds can also be the most affecting.</p></div>"|7564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7564-clemency/|8.2|Matt LeMay

Hearing one of Tom Waits'
    love songs in a cover version by a traditionally ""good"" singer, for example, can be enjoyable, but it's no match for the real thing. The extra emotional
    kick in a song like ""I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You"" comes from hearing his mournful croak coughing up the words. During these ballads a
    voice so raw and everyman becomes a powerful tool for exploring tenderness.</p><p>
    Montreal's Frankie Sparo definitely has the rough-voiced part down. That his unschooled wail can make it to record is a testament to the lasting
    influence of ""anyone can do it"" punk. He could be any drunk perched on a barstool warbling along to the juke. On his debut record <i>My Red Scare</i>,
    though, Sparo wasn't able to get tunes to take him where his voice wanted to go. There were no melodic gems buried in the old rags and crumpled
    newspapers. The record sounded nice and had an effective atmosphere, but it only had a couple good songs. Sitting here now I can only remember one
    actual melody, and I listened to <i>My Red Scare</i> plenty.</p><p>
    The good news with <i>Welcome Crummy Mystics</i>, Sparo's second full-length, is that he's improving. He's fleshed out the instrumentation (he toured
    with A Sliver Mt. Zion and recorded a radio-shot EP with the band called Arena Hostile, and many of the usual Montreal post-rock suspects are here)
    but more important, he's crafted more memorable songs. The opening \x93Hospitalville\x94 sets the tone: sweeping strings provide sonic
    lushness while plinking piano and standup bass evoke the lush life of Strayhorx92s dives. And you can hum it. Rubbery acoustic bass and piano also
    decorate ""My Sister\x94, which is like tuneful music handed down from Tin Pan Alley blended with a dollop of melancholy Weill/Brecht expressionism.</p><p>
    When he's not writing grayscale piano ballads, Sparo experiments a bit but this time tosses in the occasional hook. ""Back on Speed"" is dominated by
    off-key screaming (I mean, he's not even <em>close</em> to the tune) that verges on annoying when the song takes a surprise turn. A stern male chorus
    in the lengthy outro transforms ""Back on Speed"" into what could be an Eastern European anthem of workers' solidarity. ""Caméra"" has a wonderful
    Badalamenti thing happening, with a gorgeous tremelo guitar, Sparo's, doubled voice (lyrics here in French) and subtle processed drones elevating
    a simple song into a kaleidoscopic whirlpool of gauzy nostalgia.</p><p>
    There are a few dead spots. ""City As Might Have Been"" in particular seems a throwback to his debut. It opens with a nice string arrangement &amp; throbbing
    tables, but the melody is nowhere and cax92t be redeemed by the tiny orchestra sawing away. Still, because of its production, even the dead spots
    are fair.  <i>Welcome Crummy Mystics</i> at its worst is so-so orchestral rock from the players that have perfected the form, but those moments when Sparo's
    songwriting rise to the same level make the record worthwhile.</p></div>"|7401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7401-welcome-crummy-mystics/|7.5|Mark Richardson

The epitaph 
    will read, ""Everything was just too damn 'quaint'.""  Even now, with Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyonds, Pier One Imports, and Martha Stewart 
    boxing up quaintness and delivering it our doorsteps, only Wal-Mart stands as a bulwark, a final line of cheap, tacky crap to hold back the flood.  Of course, it's not enough, 
    and soon we'll all be drowning in a raging torrent of only marginally less tacky, cloyingly ""charming"" crap, and every last handcrafted, authenticity-guaranteed, cried-on-by-an-Amish-kid 
    nugget will have a country-fresh scent.  Right now, acoustic folk music is a disturbing mirror of our culture's commodification of all things endearing.  Everyone has a tuneful, sappy song to sing.</p><p>
    Jon DeRosa, the musical psychologist-cum-supervillain behind the lush, 
    atmospheric recordings of Aarktica, has repeatedly shown a remarkable ability for walking a very fine line: his work as Aarktica 
    is inviting without becoming pandering, warm without becoming stifling, and at times, he has even manages the difficult trick of making 
    his ambient electronic compositions seem both distant and intimate all at once.  Seemingly genuine emotion is the key to his successes in that icy genre, and more than anything 
    else, he knows how to express it with even the most impersonal drones.</p><p>
    So what happens when that same talent for evoking powerful responses is applied to a genre in which the heartfelt yearning of a Sensitive Singer-Songwriter, the lost loves, the spiritual 
    revelations, has all become just a little...cliché, too expectedly earnest even for the most hackneyed acoustic guitar slinger?  Well, if you're as skilled as DeRosa, two things occur.  
    First, you find a refuge in minimal, subtly nuanced arrangements: a sparsely plucked banjo, some stray guitar chords or a piano, and understated, mournful vocals.  You find beauty in the 
    soft spaces between notes as well as the notes themselves, and you never once substitute emotional bluster when careful simplicity will suffice.  Second, as long as you're singing about 
    God and The One That Got Away, you still kinda fall in that murky goo that all singer-songwriters slog through.</p><p>
    Jon DeRosa's work is often truly charming and often deeply affecting, but by choosing to approach folk in such a conventional 
    manner, he blends in with too many also-rans in the languid race for a grand acoustic ballad.  DeRosa's gentle voice could be 
    his ace in that pursuit, but why bother?  It dominates the Alan Sparhawk (Low) mix so heavily that even when he overcomes the instrumental 
    limitations of the form, it's still consumed by a big-hearted voice too unremarkable to bear the full weight of a melody . </p><p>
    It's an interesting choice to hide the music, since it tends to retain a slightly stale genericness and the silences are often the most compelling aspect of the songs, and on top of that, it 
    further sets apart the truly affecting moments of <i>These Are the New Good Times</i>.  DeRosa covers his own work (as Aarktica) in a gorgeous, string-heavy rendition of ""Aura Lee"", where 
    replacing the thrumming background gauze of the original with crystalline violins and shedding the thick vocal distortions exposes the melody in it's rawest form.  ""Metropolitan Love Song"" 
    and ""Sunday Matinee"" also stand apart from the rest on the strength of the piano and strings, respectively, although at that point it's moot because they're still encumbered by the weight 
    of the genre's (very, very heavy) traditions.  De Rosa was better off bringing warmth to the arctic than trying to sell heart to a genre that always has too much to spare.</p></div>"|6126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6126-these-are-the-new-good-times/|6.3|Eric Carr

    psychedelic short-circuit funk that sounds like Sly Stone taking over Manitoba's laptop-processed pop,
    pressing every button on the console to make sure you hear something that trips you up and out. Sliced-in
    guitar scratches blip all jerky behind Shannon Lee's gospel belting.  And when that tack's exhausted its
    tweakability, a sunny west-coast pop blur sweeps in underneath and carries the rest of the way through.
    You'd have to be awfully jaded not to drop your jaw, however metaphorically, during that first wow-inducing
    rush. HELLO, it says: this is the first time Brad Laner has dragged out and dusted off the Medicine name
    in around eight years, and he's clearly hoping to make an occasion of it.</p><p>
    Not that the sound is a complete surprise-- if anything, it feels like the obvious culmination of the noises
    Laner's spent his long career making. (He's one of those Los Angeles music-biz lifers; his drumming brother
    even makes him a family lifer, like the Waronkers or the Hadens; he was in Savage Republic when I still had
    a flat-top; you will never stop this guy making records.) Medicine itself started off as a full band, and
    one of America's more interesting shoegazer troupes-- partly because Laner's guitar noise had more to do
    with ear-bleeding buzz than the tripped-out swooning of My Bloody Valentine, and partly because he was one
    of few to take note of MBV's tentative attraction to tech beats. But Medicine-- after collaborating with
    both Cocteau Twins and contributing a popular track to <i>The Crow</i>'s soundtrack that painted them as
    gothy dreamers-- fizzled and stalled and shortly split.</p><p>
    Since then, Laner's released a record nearly every year as The Electric Company, gravitating toward samplers and computers and a dozen breeds of guitar drone, electronica, Krautrock homage, and IDM tweakery. While this may have struck Medicine's rock fans as some sort of static purgatory, Laner's currently rising star says otherwise: he eventually linked up with Kid606's attention-grabbing Tigerbeat6 label (the Kid programs some drums here), lending him a visibility one imagines helped buoy him back up to the point of reviving Medicine. That, and\x97even though Laner sings quite a bit here\x97the re-addition of a female vocalist: Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce, which brings the whole Crow thing full circle.</p><p>
    That's the back-story. <i>The Mechanical Forces of Love</i>, as it turns out, is less a synergy of old-Medicine and Laner's Electric Company excursions and more just a fine-tuned pile-up of them. Both impulses are there, constantly jostling for space, and it's the unpredictable victories of each that make the record a surprising listen: just when you've locked onto a guitar-noise groove, the bottom drops out, revealing a pit of queasily acidic squelches; just when you think you've figured out which recognizable blend of pop and technology Laner's working with, the whole thing turns disorientingly on its head and leaves you hanging. There are times when this makes the record impressive and times when it seems like Laner's too interested in pulling out the rug to ever get the furniture set up.</p><p>
    This makes for some gorgeous movements, whose occasionally fleeting appearances in the sifted jumble are half the fun. \x93Best Future\x94 spangles out acoustic guitars and arranges soaring choral harmonies like the airy and crystalline earnestness of His Name Is Alive; \x93I M Yrs\x94 kicks off with a dubby tech groove that's both sort of shocking and just chewily perfect. \x93Astral Gravy,\x94 which follows, is the big resurrection of old-Medicine circa The Buried Life, when Laner realized how great it sounds to filter rootsy guitar-boogie through the dream-pop sound. And above and beyond all of those solid moments, there are countless gorgeous half-minute stretches of meandering dub turns, of psychedelic crescendos, of enveloping atmospheres and out-of-nowhere guitar groans: tech-assisted as it may be, this is a psychedelic record at heart, and those are the bits that count.</p><p>
    But even before the rush of the sonics wears off, the flip-side of that is obvious: the flip-side has, in fact, been obvious since Medicine's 1992 debut. Then, as now, there are the odd Medicine tracks that feel disturbingly empty, and not in the good way: the trebly drone or languid low end might be right to get lost in, but they meander less than thrillingly, as if Laner's response to a lack of concrete ideas is to disorient you and then croon druggily as if there's something there. Sometimes there isn't: it's a curious quality, particular to Medicine records, of extended murk with no way inside.</p><p>
    With <i>The Mechanical Forces of Love</i>, that's a small caveat: whatever falls through the sieve is worth shrugging off in favor of the nuggets that stay inside. It's a striking return for Laner-as-Medicine\x97a psychedelic record with a robot inside, seriously woozy and surprisingly soul-touched trippiness of the lights-out, headphones-on, I-am-sinking-into-a-bottomless-fog variety. For some it might burn off quickly, but for just as many it'll sit just fine.</p></div>"|5202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5202-the-mechanical-forces-of-love/|8.0|Nitsuh Abebe

    Noyes? Do something about the bandname being either a pun on ""noise"" or maybe a typical CapNJazz gesture, like Kinsella's ""Friend/Enemy""-- except this 
    is a negative affirmation, ""no/yes."" All Google yields is a minor, minor poet and two museums. Can't even find a guaranteed ethnicity. Might be a street name if 
    the liner notes aren't a dick-around. Could be a ref. to Ernest Noyes Brookings...you know, the senior citizen songwriter Yo La Tengo, Idlewild, and Robyn Hitchcock 
    cover. Ryan, doesn't the new Pitchfork office have interns that could be my fact-checking cuzzes here? Yes, I listened to Pavement as 
    I rode my bike in the wind today.  I had total nineties hair.</p><p>
    
    Jesus H. Candlebox, let's face the musiquarium: Victor Villareal is the best guitar player alive. Strike ""player""; he's a manipulator, a revisionist, a masseuse-- he 
    should test axxxes for Consumer Reports when NASA sends guitars into space for the big thing when Elton John dies during the next Democratic presidency. I 
    will one day tell my kids about shaking Vic's brilliant hand after an Owls show, even though he was talking to the lispy, shut-in cokehead I had a crush on before 
    her parents yanked her out of school and confined her to their town named for a gay saint. This band's full length should be called <i>Keeping It Villareal</i>. </p><p>
<i>Bowers, you are pushing it.</i></p><p>
    
    Oh my diffident God, he milks the instrument's elasticity. Chris: use ""symphonic,"" ""collapsible"" and ""parlous.""  It's like the instrument has lice, and he's coaxing them out, 
    unafraid to venture from the antiseptic glory of the post-rock shimmer-tone, flirting with ""world"" and ""metal"" interludes.  Word is Villareal can't even keep track 
    of his tunings. That stench? The absent mind of G-E-N-I-U-S.</p><p>
    
    Good old Rapsys is a one-man rhythm-section all over the globe. His Ulrich-y doublations must be why the first track got called ""Puppet Of Masters""; my 
    desktop Bose were producing air like warehouse turbines.  The vocal track ""News Scatters"" showcases more tinny funk-dub talent (from a duo, recall) in its two 
    minutes than many  pedal-stockpiling four-pieces muster throughout whole albums. Rapsys matches and accents Vic's every pullback-and-release on ""This Is 
    The Bad 1"".  Wait until ""So Long, Long Songtitles"" (another possible Kinsella reference?) when Villareal relaxes with his most repetitive and mundane pinch-riff, 
    because Rapsys brings the bottom-end noise as well the cyborgy keys and Mick Turner-style atmospherics.</p><p>
    
    So Ott, I gotta get outta here.  Just warn people who find all ""post-"" stuff a tad manila that they might find these prodigy-steeds and virtuosi-bums...a tad manila. 
    And get the phrase ""soul music that requires a scientific calculator"" in there somewhere. Maybe a line about kitchen appliances slow-dancing. Man, that was 
    effed-up how in <i>Gremlins</i>, they were cooking and dicing those <i>Gremlins</i> (which obviously represented teenagers) and then Spielberg would make 
    <i>Schindler's List</i>.  I mean, <i>Gremlins</i> was like <i>Teenage Holocuast</i>. Consider ending the review with a Public Enemy shout-out (Bring the Noyes!), but I 
    can't tell if that'd be dingleberry or not.</p></div>"|5854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5854-noyes-ep/|7.9|William Bowers

In the hands of Soundmurderer, dj/Rupture (aka Nettle) and the rest of the 
    <i>Broklyn Beats</i> series contributors, and a new wave of Brazilian producers, jungle's resurgence focuses primarily on the more gruff, harsh ragga crossover, an 
    oddly non-dancefloor-oriented revisionism that negates most connections to anything light or feminine or-- oddly-- the communal sensibility rooted in rave.</p><p>
<i>Wired for Sound</i> collects three mixes of jungle-ragga mashups. In total, there are 60 tracks here-- most of which were first released on vinyl-only in the mid-1990s-- spread over 
    70 minutes, although it's not necessary for one to have a sense of the song's or genre's history to enjoy it. The mix combines the moments of release-- the peaks of each 
    track--  so there are no breakdowns and a total absence of any sort of ebb-and-flow dynamic. Instead, it's an exquisitely blended scrum, an exhausting high-speed compact 
    consolidation of harsh rhythm and sonic sludge best listened to one mix at a time than in one 70-minute setting.</p><p>
    
    Unlike many of the releases on the purposefully low-key Violent Turd (Kid606's bastard-pop label), <i>Wired for Sound</i> isn't a smothering of pop sensibilities in splatter beats 
    and sonic goo. Instead, it's a flat-out denial of some of the more pop elements of jungle-- omissions that will irk some, but no doubt be welcome to others. So while Detroit-based 
    Soundmurderer (Todd Osborn, with help from Tadd Mullinix) resurrects jungle, it does so with a very selective memory. There is certainly a bit of self-serving revisionist history on 
    display here as Osborn is celebrating the template in which his own ragga-jungle music-- to date only available on 12-inch singles-- is rooted, but he's not passing the mixes 
    off as a definitive compilation or even an accurate representation of the time or scene, so no bother. </p><p>
    
    The three mixes focus on the infancy of jungle: the explicit influence of high-speed, sometimes Caribbean rhythms and ragga rude bwoys on hardcore rave. Like dj/Rupture's 
    <i>Minesweeper Suite</i>-- also released on Violent Turd-- they draw connections between the rhythms of the ghettoized people of different cultures, placing the fruits of 
    Jamaican soundclashes next to Nation of Islam-inspired jungle such as Kement Crew's ""Truth Over Falsehood"".</p><p>
    
    Leaving room for ragga artists such as Barrington Levy, Cutty Ranks, Ninjaman, and Dennis Brown, Soundmurderer is mostly interested in interpretations of their rhythms and 
    postures, a reimagination of jungle as the dark music of swaggering almost gangsta individuals rather than the domain of communality. Even though it was artists like 
    Shy FX-- included here-- who first broke jungle in the UK charts, this bass- and dancehall-heavy style soon dissipated, replaced by the often jazz-oriented, whitewashed ""intelligent"" 
    drum and bass that hastened jungle's mostly ignominious ending. So although Osborn clearly suffers tunnel vision, his focus on the paranoia and dread of darkcore is as 
    welcome a narrow focal point as he could have chosen. And with ragga written out of too much of the unofficial history of jungle, it's a potentially crucial one as well.</p><p>
    
    Yet while Soundmurderer rescues the thrill of jungle from the head music boredom of its offshoots, the velocity, ferocity, and monolithic force of his mashups makes also negates 
    any possibility that he is making dance music. Because we're without a community or social structure with which to engage with others through jungle-- there are almost no jungle 
    club nights in the U.S.-- that oddly makes a bit of sense. However if jungle did undergo a true renaissance, it would be a shame were it to do so through this haughty, IDM lens. </p><p>
    
    On <i>Wired for Sound</i>, we're offered the rhythmic innovation of early jungle and ragga, but matched with the chin-stroking and quasi-art home music of ambient drum and 
    bass. It's a wonderful, crucial reminder of why jungle was one of the 90s true high points, but-- like the work of Squarepusher or a lot of Kid606's other sonic prankster 
    cohorts-- shows a curious unwillingness to value or even acknowledge its body-first roots. It may be a straw man's history of jungle, but it's also a solid, succinct 
    argument for why it's so beloved; sort of a greatest breaks collection that, although you can't dance to it, has a revolutionary beat.</p></div>"|7375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7375-wired-for-sound/|8.2|Scott Plagenhoef

I wasn't a curmudgeonly kid, but the notion of the Big Top always filled me with
    dull dread.  Some entertainments are simply meant to die, replaced by snazzier, safer and/or more sophisticated
    forms of leisure. And that's good-- that's progress. The mystery play, <i>bangsawan</i> and blackface
    burlesque are all happily retired diversions, subject to occasional, ironic revisitation or ill-informed
    nostalgia. But the circus somehow perseveres with its cruelty to animals, displays of aimless skill,
    terrible sex politics and-- last but not least-- abominable music.</p><p>
    
    Which is where Tod Ashley-- frontman of Firewater-- and I part ways. He loves the circus.  This much can be
    confirmed by a quick glance at the Firewater's record covers, but any track off <i>The Man on the Burning
    Tightrope</i>-- even more so than the band's three previous records-- reveals a wealth of swirly organs,
    squawking accordions, crunchy snares and carny-barker vocals. Before I start talking about the songs,
    let's make a pact. If you happen to like this sort of sensibility, if you need something to tie you
    over between Tiger Lilies records, and finally, if you thought the Zoot Suit Riots of '97 were the best thing
    since Tom Waits...then by all means disregard my sour tone, take everything that follows
    as praise, and multiply the record's rating by the factor of 1.5. Oh, and know that I hate Cirque du
    Soleil, too.</p><p>
    
    The opening instrumental ""Fanfare"" sets the tone with a horn section breathing fire over
    exaggerated, dramatic rolls (the album was produced by the band's Israeli-born drummer, and, perhaps
    unsurprisingly, mixed to showcase the rhythm section). ""Anything at All"" follows, with Ashley croaking
    come-ons like ""If I were a memory I'd creep into your head."" It bears mentioning that Firewater's lyrics are a
    bit on the eye-rolling side, with a preponderance of weak verb rhymes (""Everybody
    lies/ Loves/ Lives/ Cries/ Tries/ Dies,"" this sort of thing). By the third track-- the boringly-titled ""Too
    Much (Is Never Enough)""-- Ashley's vocal affectations suddenly bring to mind Smash Mouth.
    Considering that we're talking about the former frontman of Cop Shoot Cop, that is a sad,
    sad sentence to write. </p><p>
    
    ""Too Many Angels"" is the first to fully make good on the circus theme, and culminates in a fantastic,
    squeaky solo that may blow your left speaker. From here on, the band settles firmly into the
    antic-roadshow act that doesn't let up for the rest of the record. The title song even devolves into a Sgt.
    Pepper skit: ""Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for the one-- the only-- the Man on the
    Burning Tightrope!"" </p><p>
    
    In its second half, Ashley's concept-heavy contraption begins to run out of steam. ""Secret"" stoops to set
    answering-machine messages to music and ""Ponzi's Revenge"" is an instrumental allusion to Firewater's second
    album, <i>The Ponzi Scheme</i>.  The album winds up with not one but two-- two!-- reprises of earlier tracks: ""Dark
    Days Revisited"", a faux-Slavic stomp with a gypsy choir, and a superfluous return of ""Fanfare"". Putting
    aside my dislike of the P.T. Barnum milieu, I will concede that there is a way to approach its arcane
    aesthetic with wit and subtlety (witness Grant Lee Philips, or the films of Mark and Michael Polish).
    You, in turn, must concede that this is not it.</p></div>"|3069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3069-the-man-on-the-burning-tightrope/|5.7|Michael Idov

I fantasize what the music of meek secretaries,
    overweight bus drivers and Puerto Rican produce stockers might sound like, as opposed to what I hear being made every day by bored college kids, whiny
    singer-songwriters, and people with good bad-hair. Always a hotbed for artistic fecundity, the East Village and Lower East Side have stumbled a bit these last
    two decades, and I lose hope that the accountants, legal consultants, and human resources co-coordinators that now inhabit the area will be coming with the
    shit-hot sounds anytime soon.</p><p>
    While a select few characters documented on Soul Jazz's latest, earnest compilation have gone onto careers playing music (Ikue Mori, Arto Lindsey,
    Glenn Branca, Bill Laswell), at the time contained within--1978 to 1982-- many of them were occupied with other disciplines: film, drama, painting, photography,
    performance art, design, fashion, audio production, etc., and would stay within these professions, the music a mere component in life's other pursuits.</p><p>
    ""Optimo"", Liquid Liquid's A side to their more-often celebrated flip ""Cavern"" (sampled by Grandmaster Melle Mel for ""White Lines""), opens the set with a cowbell-driven
    blast of snares, clavé, booty-throbbing bass kicks, roto-toms, and elastic bass that blows past the produced percussion stomps by the likes of A Certain Ratio and
    !!!.  Mars' ""Helen Forsdale""-- the sole escapee of <i>No New York</i>'s black hole-- remains as vital and dark as ever, the two and a half minutes exhilerates like a leap off of
    the Manhattan Bridge. DNA's track from the <i>American Clavé</i> single similarly excites in this one-minute context.</p><p>
    Glenn Branca, Pitchfork's last recipient of the 10.0, represents the avant-garde that also took roots in the LES with his first composition for two electric guitars.
    Chiming and grinding as chimeras, ""Lesson No.1"" predicts entire band career trajectories with the eight-minute piece. His previous band's only single, the
    Theoretical Girls' ""You Got Me"", grafts amplified anvil hits to the chord progression from ""Trans-Europe Express"" and a bludgeoning guitar attack that will in ten
    years' time be called Helmet.</p><p>
    If ""Rapper's Delight"" is the <i>Odyssey</i> of hip-hop, is ""Beat Bop"" its <i>Ulysses</i>? This epic by Rammelzee and K. Rob (along with painter Jean Michel Basquiat in the
    studio producing) contains so many mutant strains of the genre's DNA that each time through reveals whole new levels of meaning. My first time hearing it on Ego
    Trip's compilation a few years ago disclosed the wellspring of countless songs, samples, and careers of some of hip-hop's finest, like the Beastie Boys (I count at
    least five songs) and (in every aspect) Cypress Hill. Contained within the duo's constant flow of back and forth rhymes at once funky, randomly off the dome, street
    observational, laid-back, complicated, alien-tweaked, and socially conscious are layouts for other adventurous types like De La Soul, Slick Rick, the Pharcyde, Kool
    Keith, Quasimoto, Old Dirty Bastard, and Outkast.</p><p>
    The sounds of late 70's funk radio is obvious throughout; from the mocked hi-hat chatter, disco choruses, canned handclaps, and bright horn bursts to the naïf-Nile
    Rodgers sleek slap bass bottom and chopped guitar comping of so many Philly Soul joints are attempted in both the awkward playing and bare-bones production,
    mostly to endearing effect. When slide guitars are stirred in, as on the Contortions' ""Contort Yourself"" and Lizzy Mercier Descloux's ""Wawa"", it makes for the funky
    correlation of the arrhythmic and atonal guitar jags of Captain Beefheart and his, uh, Dazz Band. ""Reduction"", an early Material track, before Bill Laswell went on to
    weave radio staples like Whitney Houston (then-unknown), Nona Hendryx, and Bootsy Collins into the mix, even shows a fondness for early musique concrète and
    Cage's imaginary landscapes, dropping snippets of religious broadcasts into their studious funk and paving the way to future sound collaging, from the Butthole
    Surfers to DJ Shadow.</p><p>
    Arthur Russell, the criminally forgotten cellist, Allen Ginsburg accompanist, minimalist composer, narrowly-averted Talking Head, and creator of exquisite Paradise
    Garage staples and proto-house sides like ""Go Bang #5"", ""Kiss Me Again"", and ""Tell You Today"" has another piece rescued from the unissued catalog: ""Clean
    On Your Bean"". While there are jumping off points from ""Go Bang #5"", Russell stirs echoing group chatter as lyrics, rippling guitar, fusiony organ stabs, congos,
    cello strokes, and trombones to delirious effect, letting Francois Kevorkian sort it out in the mix. </p><p>
    It's long-winded at seventy-one minutes, as most Soul Jazz overviews tend to stay concise (their post-punk counterpart from the UK, <i>In the Beginning was Rhythm</i>,
    was a half-hour shorter), but trying to assimilate all the important foundations that arose out of this particular lot of ground is near impossible. Lydia Lunch and
    James ""Blood"" Ulmer are left out, unfortunately, but there are many vying for its cramped space, and inclusion of The Dance and The Blood surprises. From hip-hop
    to no-wave, jazz-punk disco to house music to electroclash, sleek funk to crusty noise, there's a lot to cover, and Soul Jazz does the job admirably, touring the
    biggest landmarks and some of the interesting diversions not on the map, but nonetheless co-existing side-by-side.</p></div>"|1989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1989-new-york-noise/|8.4|Andy Beta

Many still believe dreams come from 
    rapid batting of our eyelids, sometimes at a rate of up to one hundred or one-hundred and twenty times per minute. Our sight sphere sheaths flutter energetically-- 
    albeit, nearly undetectably-- and because of them, an otherwise motionless body moves about freely at night in a world to which only the mind is privy: the land of 
    dreams, the land of make-believe. Without such kinetic energy, that very same body remains betwixt its sheets, and the mind nary leaves 
    the pillow. Put simply, there's a fine line between the greatest revelatory dream and the most inconsequential night of sleep.</p><p>
    On <i>Come Here When You Sleepwalk</i>, Clue To Kalo-- aka Australia's Mark Mitchell-- walks that line, as have Dntel, Boards of Canada, Ulrich Schnauss, 
    and occasionally Schneider TM before him. Mitchell even seems to acknowledge his tenuous position: both sides of the disc are 
    unmarked and reflective, the division between content and coaster frustratingly blurred.</p><p>
    The album is beautiful enough: it has the lush washes of sound, the simple, sparingly-used voice blended in, the nostalgic, lovelorn lyrics replete with a tinge of cynicism, all essential 
    nocturnal vocabulary. When these sounds seek to transcend into dreams, though, it ultimately comes down to those subtle, nearly undetectable 
    flutters of energy; intangibles transform pretty but otherwise stagnant sound, building, collapsing and coming to a logical conclusion.   <i>Come Here When You Sleepwalk</i> 
    contains a few such inspired, dream-inducing interludes, but overall, constitutes an array of well-crafted sonic images that frustratingly go nowhere.</p><p>
    As if to performatize our foray into his dream world, Clue to Kalo spends the first forty-five seconds of ""The First Song of the Rest of Your Life""-- nearly half the track-- easing up the volume 
    level until we're adequately enveloped in its waves, vocal echoes, and martian beats. He lets it fester, only to cut off the track suddenly and begin the only close-to-perfect song on the 
    album, and one of the best I've heard this year: ""Empty Save The Oxygen"" </p><p>
    A processed guitar fumbles initially, then finds itself as a subtle, driving pulse; it churns throughout as electronic ticks and whisps dance in the background.  
    Mitchell emerges quietly, but confidently on vocals: "" I'd like to love you, but I'd like a lot of things."" It's a song that, if we ever had the choice, our fed-up lovers would sing to 
    us on the eve of our breakups, sparing the equivocation of ""I still want us to be friends."" </p><p>
    ""Empty Save The Oxygen"" is no new take on Humanity's Bout With Inevitable Personal Disappointment, but unlike songs with similar emotional content, it refuses to 
    wallow. Indeed, as Mitchell retires on vocals, it's invigorated by a profound optimism-- everything is clearer, the ticks become more precise and concentrated, the beat more 
    present. Everything sucks, but everything is going to be okay.</p><p>
    After this truly exhilarating opening, the rest of the album makes for poor man's imitation-- especially since Clue to Kalo's palette is more or less fixed.  The songs 
    are frustratingly stagnant-- albeit beautiful-- exercises in lap-pop textures. This would be fine-- wonderful even-- would that the same level of inner energy present in ""Empty Save the Oxygen"" 
    came through, but unfortunately, with the exception of the deftly executed ""This Dies Over Distance"" and the 11-minute sonic rollercoaster ""Still We Felt Bulletproof"", shapes hardly shift. 
    The listener is left with pretty loops, but hardly the carefully considered songs Clue to Kalo has already shown he can compose.</p><p>
    Had <i>Come Here When You Sleepwalk</i> been released three or four years ago, it would have been highly regarded if only by merit of its sound. But as 
    the lap-pop genre has grown leaps and bounds, both musically and technologically, it's become formulaic: simple ear 
    candy isn't impressive anymore. Song structure-- the ""pop"" element of ""lap-pop""-- is playing catch-up to electronica's sonic triumphs. At his best, 
    Clue to Kalo shows he has a unique sensibility, capable of advancing the genre's subtle electronic shoegazing.  Here's hoping his next release delivers; it should be fantastic.</p></div>"|1520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1520-come-here-when-you-sleepwalk/|7.0|Nicholas B. Sylvester

    Most distressing: patient's inability to organize speech into patterns that express the more complex thoughts usually associated with severe acid damage. Insipid rhymes like ""I Said

    stagnation it might eventually result in.  For established artists, there's no more sleep-depriving quandry
    than whether to stick with a successful, proven formula or throw it all out the window in favor of a radical
    change.  But even for a few of those lucky superstars, it just comes naturally, without any deep contemplation.
    Critically speaking, bands who gravitate toward change get high marks for their willingness to continually
    invent and to challenge convention; the water-treaders simply get fans.  It's unfair on any number of levels,
    I suppose, but it's with that understanding that I declare Gang Starr among the most consistent acts in hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    Ever since <em>Step in the Arena</em> and <em>Daily Operation</em> laid down the law for East Coast hip-hop back
    in '91 and '92, Gang Starr have slowed their pace with an ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" aesthetic,
    releasing albums every four or five years between Guru and DJ Premier's increasingly busy extracurricular
    schedules.  And while they haven't broken any new ground since those early 90s classics, their records have
    been astoundingly solid in bearing the standards set by those canonical discs.</p><p>
    
    In the five years since <em>Moment of Truth</em>, Guru and Primo have watched as the face of mainstream hip-hop
    hardened into a countenance chiseled out with bling-bling braggadocio and self-hating diatribes. Fortunately,
    for a duo that's been hard from day one-- don't let that <em>No More Mr. Nice Guy</em> cover fool you-- there's
    a distinct possibility their credibility could translate into commercial success, almost as if the rap world
    has finally caught up with a group that was ten years ahead of its time.  The combination of Guru's tough,
    streetwise lyrics and delivery and Premier's highly polished production fits in perfectly as an honest
    alternative to today's heavy rotation; it's a situation Gang Starr are well aware of, judging from several
    lyrical and interlude reminders that pop up throughout <em>The Ownerz</em>.</p><p>
    
    The record's first single, ""Skills"", is a prime example of its overall potential to launch Gang Starr into
    the mainstream with the respect they've enjoyed in the underground intact.  Carried by the kind of popping
    bassline and sucka-challenging bravado that's powered all of their classic cuts, it's incredibly catchy
    without being overtly commercial. Throw in a couple of high-profile cameos-- most notably Jadakiss'
    firespitting verse on ""Rite Where U Stand"" and Snoop Dogg's right-at-home drawling over Premier's ""In This
    Life..."" beat (returning the favor of some beats Primo cooked up for his <em>Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$</em>
    LP)-- and <em>The Ownerz</em> could accomplish that rarest of feats: commercial success that doesn't require
    a sacrifice of integrity.</p><p>
    
    Naturally, not all of the guest spots are wildly triumphant-- back-to-back appearances by Fat Joe, M.O.P., Big Shug and Freddie Foxx on ""Who Got Gunz""
    and ""Capture (Militia Pt. 3)"" make for a thuggish lag right in the middle of the record, but the flow gets right back in line with the pair of
    cameo-free tracks that follow.  As has been customary on Gang Starr records since <em>Daily Operation</em>, Guru steps aside for some
    young emcees to prove their worth on the mic: NYG'z and H. Stax contribute solid verses to ""Same Team, No Games"" and Smiley the Ghetto Child absolutely
    tears shit up-- like a young Nas or Jeru the Damaja-- on the brief ""Werdz From The Ghetto Child"".  Still, even though the guest spots cover a wide range of
    hip-hop status levels, they all work to enforce Guru and Premier's aesthetic of consistency-- whether it's Jadakiss or NYG'z, the emcee has to make his
    style work with Gang Starr, not the other way around.</p><p>
    
    But all this talk of cameos distracts from all the unassisted cuts that prove Guru and Premier haven't lost an ounce of chemistry in their 14 years
    together.  Primo's jazzy horn breaks underscore Guru's eloquent manifestos with assured refinement on every single track they turn on their own
    (which, impressively for a major-label hip-hop release, is over half the record), even redeeming what would've been the record's weakest cut with a
    bit of imagination: a reposession of Curtis Mayfield's ""Kung Fu"" that makes Guru's mack move narrative on ""Nice Girl, Wrong Place"" a little easier to
    stomach.  For the record, Guru's candor and lack of romanticism are rather refreshing in this context-- just like hot pants, what you see is
    what you get.</p><p>
<em>The Ownerz</em> will have to hold Gang Starr fans over while Premier contracts out beats for usually the only good cuts on
    otherwise sub-par rap records, and Guru releases another tepid Jazzmatazz or (God forbid) Baldhead Slick &amp; da Click LP.  We can't expect a new Gang Starr record until
    2007 or 2008, but in the meantime, there's plenty here to celebrate for consistency's sake-- because for what they've lacked in
    evolution, Guru and Premier have more than repaid in reliability.  And while it's probably too late in their career for a breakout hit
    record, more people are definitely going to know who they are, which will hopefully translate into the same veneration from the
    establishment they've enjoyed from their fans since back in the day.</p></div>"|3391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3391-the-ownerz/|7.5|Scott Hreha

V-Twin have one of 
    those songs, a tricky little electro-blues-punk freakout called ""Delinquency"" that's so great they've used it four times and I still haven't gotten tired of it.  The band's first 
    long-player-- the singles compilation <i>Free the Twin</i>-- contained three different versions, including remixes by Royal Trux and Jagz Kooner, each of which was so unstintingly 
    brilliant, I was convinced nothing but great things lay ahead for them.  It didn't hurt that the rest of the disc was pretty good, too.</p><p>
    Well, three years later, they're still riding ""Delinquency"", this time with a denser, less dubbed-out version that simply proves that all the tampering in the world couldn't ruin this 
    song.  From the signature divebombing drum fills to singer Jason McPhail's declaration ""I reckon rock 'n' roll's from outer space,"" there are so many perfect elements in place 
    that it's impossible to kill this tune's two-chord genius.  But while the song's fourth incarnation is the undeniable high point of the album, the Glaswegian foursome is so full of 
    ideas and Northern swagger that they couldn't help but pull together an interesting album.</p><p>
    If the Beta Band are the Linus of British eclecticism, clinging to a blanket of tape-speed effects and UK electronica, then V-Twin are certainly the Pigpen, swimming in a constant 
    swirl of studio dirt and rock and roll dust.  ""Get Your Wings"" is video game music you can drink cocktails to, topped with fake mellotron and McPhail's White Album-era Lennon 
    croon; ""V-Twin City Rockers"" has those bleepy Trio synths flopping all over its fuzzy bass line and winds up sounding like Primal Scream simultaneously remixing Kraftwerk and 
    Kylie Minogue.  And then there's ""the Emperor Is Dead"", a slow dirge that ropes in the horn section from King Crimson's <i>Lizard</i> and pastes them uncomfortably amidst McPhail's 
    unintelligible pontificating and drunken programmed drums.  </p><p>
    Of course, it's possible to be so full of ideas that they start turning into bullshit, and they do in small patches, particularly on closer ""Across the Lanes"", which loses all focus as 
    a direct result of its overabundant use of echo and effects.  Likewise, the band apparently spent so much time fine-tuning all the flittering whirligigs and sputtering doodads on ""Despot 
    Blues"" that they forgot to write a real melody for it.  But this ceases to be important when you're taking in the splendid mayhem of opener ""Call a Meeting"", a Jasper Johns collage 
    of a song, pasting Albert Ayler horns, Stones bluster and garage sludge into a Pro-Tweaked barrage that bursts every so often into absolutely ecstatic guitar riffs.</p><p>
    It's a mess, but what a glorious mess it is.  The blues hits every mine in the field here, and the explosions are almost uniformly cool.  Rock and roll is a great genre precisely 
    because of its malleability, and though I'd never say these four Scots who named themselves for a Harley Davidson engine type are here to save rock, they do a damn fine job of 
    exploiting its possibilities.  If nothing else, you have to love a band that knows what they're doing is fraught with danger, yet refuses to tread lightly.</p></div>"|8388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8388-the-blues-is-a-minefield/|8.0|Joe Tangari

    This particular afternoon of Rock 'N Roll Grade School had been especially boring, even for the positive and fresh-out-of-college Mrs. Mimms: she had optimistically chosen a Friday to 
    allow everyone in her class a chance to share with their peers what they'd been working on recently.  Thus far, her expectations had been met with tired, subdued results, 
    but she was hopeful yet that some special student would rise above the rest, and offer some delight on an otherwise dreary afternoon.</p><p>
    ""Thank you Jason for that...interesting performance,"" she said, barely forcing a smile.  ""And now could Charlie Campbell please come up front and share with us his,"" Mimms 
    rifled through some papers before cautiously continuing, ""Goldcard project?""</p><p>
    A small box in the corner with a narrow horizontal slit in one of its sides began to make its way clumsily to the head of the classroom, bumping into desks, chairs and students along 
    the way.  The box approached Mrs. Mimms, whispered something quietly in her direction and situated itself to the left of her desk.  With a bewildered look on her face, she addressed the 
    class, ""It seems that Mr. Campbell has made a deal with Off Records' president Chris Slusarenko regarding his public appearances: (1) he is not to be seen or touched while the album 
    is playing, and (2) he will communicate with us via only the slit in his box.""  She sighed and added, ""So without further delay, Charlie.""</p><p>
    ""Thank you very much, Mrs. Mimms.  I would like to start by saying that none of this would be happening if it was not for the efforts of Chris and my friends in Grandaddy and Quasi, because 
    without their constant badgering I would have never compiled all of the Goldcard tapes into the album you are about to hear.  I would also like to thank my former bandmates in Pond, 
    Chris Brady and Dave Triebwasser, for their help in the following recordings.""</p><p>
    There was a rustling noise from inside the box, then slowly, music began to seep forth from its tape-covered edges, organic and fragile with a sliding 
    glissando quickly leading to what sounded like a metallic-tinged series of arpeggios.  ""This is the first track, and it is untitled, as are many of the songs on <i>Goldcard</i>.  
    That sound you hear is what I refer to throughout the project as 
    'the gimmick'; basically it is a guitar technique that approximates the sound of an electric string orchestra, and it is the basis of what inspired me to keep producing music after Pond's 
    fallout with Sony in 1998.  I recorded most of these tracks utilizing the gimmick, but then I lost sight of what the technique was-- though I guess I could have asked Ronald Jones, of the 
    Flaming Lips, or Duane Denison, of Jesus Lizard, to remind me of it-- and with it the confidence in my ability to compose excellent pop songs.""</p><p>
    Charlie continued, ""The next composition is 'We Only Doubt Which Theory We Will Be Proving First'.  This recording includes Sam Coomes and Rebecca Gates, who were 
    present for the one and only true Goldcard practice.  The metallic jangle you hear in the acoustic guitar is achieved through the use of a quarter as a pick.  The gimmick is 
    used liberally in this track, the bass line acting as 
    a lower register mirror to its skittering brightness.  This same idea is carried through to 'Destroy and Recreate', which uses warm guitar effects and my own quivering falsetto to deliver 
    abstract lines alluding to the alluring embrace of anonymity such as, 'From a dancing bear/ Subtract a waltz/ We slowly stop counting/ When long division keeps us apart.'  It's similar to 
    Coomes' Quasi-technique of deceptively accompanying even the most somber and challenging lyrical content with a dazzling and poppy beat!""</p><p>
    ""'Didn't Feel A Thing', 'Picture Of A Horse', and track twelve all utilize the talents of my former bandmates Chris and Dave, augmenting the regular, sort of lilting Goldcard sound with a 
    heavier hand.  It alternates between a backwoods plucking steel guitar to the sound of golden-age Alterna-Rock like Archers of Loaf, Grifters, or Superchunk. But 
    'Rabbit', 'If I Could Help It', and track sixteen are my return to basic indie-pop roots, all displaying the talents of either Grandaddy's old-fashioned 
    guitar-crunches and subtle melodies, Janet Weiss' methodical drumming, or gimmick-less harmonizing courtesy of Beach Boys-aficionado Sam Coomes.""</p><p>
    ""You may have noticed that tracks seven through nine seem slightly incoherent.  Though number seven-- originally 'Outside Suite' from the Colonel Jeffrey 
    Pumpernickel concept album-- is pretty saccharine compared to the drum and bass on number eight and the Vietnamese disco song that follows, they serve their 
    purpose, fanning the range of my concept and building on multiple musical ideas. Disjointed as they are, this all comes to fruition in 'Birthday', which is an 
    experiment in tempo that I believe to be the world's most ambient hardcore track, a gospel delivery recorded at  200 beats per minute.  The composition 
    is meant to provide an interesting counterpoint for the slowly evolving pulse that arises from the backdrop of sonic trickery.""</p><p>
    ""'It Had A Dream' and 'A Fascinated Eye Production' both allude to what eventually eclipsed my fascination with the gimmick and led to my final fallout with music in general-- 'It.'  'It' is 
    either the idea of Universal Love/GOD, or an inside joke between myself and Robert Pollard regarding the alcohol content of Nyquil-- you be the judge.  Either way, the extremely long 
    coda rounding out 'Fascinated Eye..."" is meant to allow the listener time to contemplate what 'It' is to you.  Even though I still haven't resolved 'It', I hope that through this album you will 
    gain some small insight into my personage, and more importantly your own.  After all, that is part-in-part the intent of music, and more broadly, art.""</p><p>
    The box grew silent, and Mrs. Mimms could not hold back the swelling in her heart brought about by the sincere exposure Charlie had just shown the class and inevitably the world at 
    large.  This was the type of work she had been waiting on for quite some time now, wading through countless poseurs and pretenders to the crown just to find that such a rare and 
    unassuming gem as Goldcard was beneath her very nose.  In terms of both talent and originality, Campbell had proven himself the best of his class, though it was a bittersweet victory 
    in that this would probably be the last release to bare his privileged mark.  Somehow that only added to the romantic nature of such a work though, as it suddenly struck her as poetic 
    that Charlie had ended his career on such a high note.  As far as she was concerned his legacy was now cemented, her gratefulness in his courage to finally release <i>Goldcard</i> 
    far outweighing any anger at never having another taste of his undeniable talent.</p></div>"|3500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3500-goldcard/|8.6|Andrew Bryant

Counting two former members of the excellent but defunct Laddio Bolocko, and 
    fronted by a German woman called Silke-- clearly unafraid of bringing the drama like Siouxsie used to do-- the band should add up to a fairly sizeable 
    fish in the tiny, usually refreshing pond of neo art-rock.  However, some funny things happened on the way to the next big thing: sinister theatrics became 
    campy cabaret, digital age psychedelia lapsed into flat, by-the-numbers post-rock, and a modern take on the otherworldly grandeur of The Doors 
    became a lightweight, impotent Jane's Addiction run-through.   The lesson-- especially for Laddio Bolocko fans-- might be that you can't always get what you want.  
    For anyone else, maybe something like ""steer clear of falling stars.""</p><p>
    
    Electric Turn to Me was formed last summer, apparently inspired by eccentric 60s psyche-pop acts like Love and Pretty Things, though to my ears 
    not even in the same universe.  Where the Pretty Things were scruffy mod rockers with hearts of art, sounding as 
    convincing on the folk-laced ""Private Sorrow"" as they did on all-out jams like ""Walking Through My Dreams"", ETTM seem a tad forced.  It doesn't help 
    that their bassless lineup often fails to really bring the power during frequent ""climactic"" moments, though they do pump up the tympanis on 
    occasion-- yeah!  Still, none of that compares to vocalist Silke, who is polarization personified.  Her voice is, shall we say, 
    distinctive.  Her vibrato is...positively traumatic.  For better or for worse, she dominates this music with a thick, wavering tone and Teutonic dread 
    that gives me sore throat just thinking about it.  It's not going to take most folks long to determine if they can handle her.</p><p>
    
    The best moment on <i>Electric Turn to Me</i> is its first 30 seconds, as the band blasts out of the gate on ""First Crimes"" playing hyperspeed, electro-fied 
    rocket rock very reminiscent of Laddio Bolocko.  And then, she happens.  ""FIRRRRST CRIIIIMES, EVERYDAYNIGHTWHENTHEMOONTHOUGHTSOFYERSIDE.""  Well, I 
    can't really tell what she's singing, but her message is loud and clear: bow down before my black terror, o subjects of despair!  The vampire movie organ 
    that accompanies her does a nice job of transforming the vibe from threepenny operatic tension into is-this-supposed-to-be-funny rocky horror.  
    A minute later, Silke manages to unleash the full power of her sonic arsenal, and all I can think of is that scene in <i>Lord of the Rings</i> when Cate 
    Blanchett freaks out and turns silver and blue.</p><p>
    
    ""Watch Out for the Witch"" is slightly less over the top, though clearly the band missed an opportunity here when they titled the record.  Drummer Blake 
    Fleming's ultra-tight pulse, alongside the clipped, distorted keyboard figure make for a decent (and mercifully straightforward-- never thought I'd 
    be so grateful for that) backdrop over which Silke plays it cool for a little bit.  Of course, she lets loose in the chorus, but the song itself 
    isn't a bad update on 60s rock opera a la S.F. Sorrow.  ""Nightvision"", on the other hand, is pretty dreadful: Silke visits the other extreme of her 
    vocal repertoire, opting for moaning, wavering strains while the band is relegated to the unenviable role of trying to keep the ballad moving lest it 
    dissolve into art-show melodrama.  They manage to do this best during the more intense sections, as Fleming hacks at his cymbal and guitarist James Wilk offers a few 
    arpeggios that wouldn't sound out of place on Simple Minds song.  Remember, these are the good parts.</p><p>
    
    Despite my various reservations with <i>Electric Turn to Me</i>, I'm not without hope.  There is a faint connection between the devastating bombast of Silke 
    and the eccentric (but expressive) work of Dagmar Krause (formerly of Slapp Happy and the Art Bears).  Perhaps, like Krause and her bands, Silke and 
    ETTM will develop a sound that makes better use of their various strengths, as I'm certain there must be away to make this mix work.  Until then, tread 
    carefully.</p></div>"|2737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2737-electric-turn-to-me/|3.7|Dominique Leone

    Most of the discernable lyrics offer themselves up as a more risqué interpretation of Karen O's Sheena-is-a-bitch-in-heat shtick-- a High Society to play off the YYY's Playboy.
    Note the following instructions from ""Pretend I'm Sleeping"": ""I want your baby/ So you'll have to come inside me.""</p><p>
    If you've ever heard Weasel Walter's guitar work on the Lake of Dracula album-- chunky, thick, dissonant, frantic-- you might think Sick Lipstick's guitarist owes a tithe 
    or indulgence to Skin Graft for such sincere flattery.  But the perpetual nerves that permeate this disc owe their frazzled state to the 
    supposed Now Wave scene of the mid-90s (cf. the Scissor Girls, US Maple, Arab-on-Radar, that group of film-school drop outs opening for Blonde Redhead in 
    1995 wearing Q-Bert masks and tie-died hospital smocks while playing detuned E chords on guitars strung up with fishing line-- no, wait, that last group sucked ass, 
    nevermind).  As much as the supposed Now Wavers owe their MO and livelihood (relatively speaking) to <i>No New York</i> and Screamers bootlegs, Sick Lipstick 
    brush against an equally well defined preexisting pedigree.</p><p>
    This might be a good album for those of you in a hurry, though: no song on <i>Sting Sting Sting</i> wears out its welcome, with each of the twelve tracks working itself out in 3 minutes 
    or less.  But the best track just so happens to be the longest: ""Thigh-Master I'm Your Master"" manages to make a racket that, in epileptic circles, would qualify as 
    ""danceable"", then builds on the racket to end the song with a convincing head of steam.  The other tracks follow a similar path with little variation (though the intro to ""10-4 
    Can You Read Me?"" sounds more like something from <i>Dirty</i> than something from <i>Here Is the Is-Not</i>).  This isn't a condemnation, though-- Sick Lipstick know what their 
    strengths are, and they ably play to them.  The lack of variation in their attack lends the proceedings a strange consistency; ""strange"" because I don't 
    expect a band taking their cues from the sort of chaos described earlier to qualify as ""consistent.""</p><p>
    Of course, one's fix for spastic, herky-jerky caterwauling punctuated by vocal catchphrasing might be ably sated by offerings 
    from any of the Sick Lipstick's recent antecedents (Yummy Fur, God Is My Co-Pilot) and contemporaries (Erase Errata &amp; related groups, The Ssion, even the Yeah Yeah Yeahs), or 
    even the Canadian group that gave birth to this particular brand of makeup, the much more spastic and abrasive Black Cat #13, half of which comprises Sick Lipstick.  If you're 
    thirsting for this sort of aural abuse, <i>Sting Sting Sting</i> is a fine place to get your fix, but there's a lot of good shit in town right now; you better shop around.</p></div>"|7705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7705-sting-sting-sting/|7.8|David Raposa

There's so much concentration on this record,     because the musicians don't stop to smile: the six improvised pieces are impressively inventive, yet distractedly serious.</p>
<p>This partnership started in the late nineties, when Chicagoan Grubbs met Gustafsson at a Gastr del Sol show.  A high-power reedsman from     Sweden's AALY Trio, Gustafsson runs with a pack of heavy European players who make regular trips to the Midwest's mecca; as opposed to his rigorously-trained partner, Grubbs is     known for playing post-rock, avant-folk and other off-shoots of ""rock.""   The two men recorded an album together in 1999, called <i>Apertura</i>; it was a spontaneous, enraptured hour-long     session of slow droning music, and they went on to play gigs that proved haphazard dissections of both resumes.  To quote their record label, the shows ""wandered     from song to free-jazz freakout to tunnel of drone to digital collage to mouthless saxophone and brainless, bruising guitar.""</p>
<p>You can characterize <i>Off-Road</i> simply as an effort to capture all the facets of the duo's performances, from drawn-out to curious to explosive, every instrument at     their disposal thoroughly studied and reinvented.  The album starts with its only pure virtuoso moment, Gustafsson putting his tenor through a post-Ayler duck-raping     workout.  He doesn't so much play as experiment with instruments, using contact mikes to get a stethescope-like view inside his horns. The best example of this     closeness is ""Dystopian Turboprop"", with its elephantine breaths followed by sampled clicking and fluttering-- the clacking of the keys?-- assembled into a sound that, going with     the title, resembles a flapping balsa airplane powered by a rubber band.</p>
<p>Working on laptop in addition to guitar, Grubbs dominates the samples and processing.  Even when they bring in turntablist Henry Moore Selder, he only adds moaning tonearm     rumbles; his best work here may be the maracas he plays on ""Pumpkin Creek"", a simple, tuneful piece built around a folky guitar line.  The noises, voices and found sounds that     litter the rest of the album come to a head in ""Back Off"", a dryly humorous freak-out during which a meowing cat and an opera singer face off, as Grubbs and Gustafsson run it across     downed power-lines, interjecting tinny drum machines and feedback samples.  Still, most of the random sounds on <i>Off-Road</i> are balanced by structure, Grubbs often setting     up moods or simple figures they can build on.</p>
<p><i>Off-Road</i> is short, and other improvisers would probably spend three times as long covering the same ground; this probably represents ""the best bits"" of their work on that     one day in the studio, and even though each piece is improvised, they're well defined and separated.  On the other hand, without the development that led up to these discoveries,     we're missing some important context; the tone falls somewhere between the rigorous studies of a Keith Rowe and the bring-your-flak-jacket playfulness of a Han Bennick.  Stuck     in the middle, it lacks mood; even as you dig through its nuances, you may appreciate it more than enjoy it, but fans of either performer could find it rewarding.  <i>Off-Road</i> isn't a defining statement, but it's a great index to the encyclopedic sound-world of Grubbs and Gustafsson.</p></div>"|3583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3583-off-road/|6.8|Chris Dahlen

It took me a while to even work out whether this was any good or not because my giggling kept drowning out the 
    music, but by the time ""Lost in the Plot"" came around, I'd fallen out of my armchair over such a sub-par Suede track (as sung by a Canadian who sounds disturbingly like Blur's 
    Damon Albarn circa <i>Parklife</i>). If you catch the irony there-- that The Dears have made some awfully good incidental music for shots of Justine Frischmann sorting through 
    ex-boyfriend photos-- you'll grasp my bafflement. If you don't, it turns out you've got a fighting chance at enjoying this.</p><p>
    
    Because contrary to expectations, The Dears aren't bad at this stuff: in hooks, in atmosphere, and in songwriting, Murray Lightburn-- credited with writing, producing, and 
    ""directing"" <i>No Cities Left</i>-- fares pretty well.  I'm honor-bound to inform you that this record's entertained enough people to receive some rave reviews, and even best-of-year 
    speculation, which is fair enough.  As someone with a Gene ""Sleep Well Tonight"" promotional pillowcase somewhere in my closet, I'm not about to blame anyone for enjoying a 
    decent-ish retro-Brit record. It's just that when bands run around with derivations quite as heavy as these, you expect them to sound sharp and knowing, effortless and 
    graceful, packing some brio.  The Dears, by and large, make tracks that would slide without much distinction onto any number of mid-90s albums, neither 
    gumming up the works nor sounding particularly special.</p><p>
    
    Like...if you don't remember Gene, they were the ones who wore neatly-pressed shirts and did sort of wan, effete reflections of the Smiths, like ""Heaven Knows I'm 
    Miserable Now"" with more dramatic arm-waving: jazzy guitar arpeggios, suave crooning about dirty motel rooms, occasional bouts of prancing. Only at their most 
    innocuous do The Dears sound much like Gene, although the lyric sheets are indistinguishable-- more often, Lightburn's off on the semi-orchestral cabaret-pop trip 
    that would appear to be his big agenda. You'd think that would be a new thing, but no luck: when he does it pretty, it sounds like a less moppety version of the swoony 
    tracks from Blur's <i>Parklife</i>-- say, ""To the End"", or sometimes ""End of a Century""-- and when he makes it dark and ominous, it sounds a whole lot like the cabaret-noir 
    detour Pulp took with <i>This is Hardcore</i>. That Suede-effect comes mostly when they rock, which they shouldn't, and, wisely, don't.</p><p>
    
    If all of those Britpop references mean nothing to you, good: you won't have to distract yourself from your own giggling to appreciate things like the gorgeous saxophone 
    turns on ""The Second Part"", the sneaky musette on the title track, or the subtly twisting melodies, often-keen orchestrations and melancholy pop jangle that are all over 
    this record. You won't have funny little fits of recognition when Lightburn tries on the signature vocal tics of Morrissey and Albarn both within the space of a line, or notice 
    that those ""subtly twisting melodies"" are basically just <i>Parklife</i> gone depressive, because you'll be too busy appreciating the fact that someone made the kind of big, varied, 
    and likeably pretentious pop record no one really makes anymore. You won't have to notice that the lyric sheet and the Side One / Side Two conceit of the track listing seem 
    a lot like the work of someone who spent some serious time with a cassette copy of <i>Kill Uncle</i>-- hi, Murray, me too!-- because you'll be noticing that side two is better.</p><p>
    
    S'not good enough to make this record seem like anything more than an okay album released eight years after the fact, but whatever: you can save the same reaction for 2012 bands 
    that sound like the Hives or the French Kicks.</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, I've never liked the people who take such joy in telling you you're not allowed to like a perfectly pleasant record unless you've long-appreciated similar-sounding 
    records someone else made a decade ago.  If the Dears got as big Interpol, I'd actually be pleased to know so many kids were reliving both ends of my teenage years, not to 
    mention creating a market for me to sell off some old records. I'd offer to help them come up with drinking games for the campy lyrics, like you could when Suede got ridiculous: 
    for them it was a sip every time Brett said ""animal,"" ""poison,"" or ""fire""-- for Lightburn it'd be a sip every time he sings something Gene-ish like ""What we want most is nowhere to 
    be found,"" ""I promise not to cry anymore,"" or ""All I want is to feel better."" You'll die of alcohol poisoning, not depression: in true post-Smiths fashion, he leavens all this with 
    teenage-bedroom optimism like ""You're not alone,"" ""Don't you lose the faith,"" and ""I know we can last."" Gene, for the record, did not throw <i>Bends</i>-era Radiohead guitar squalls 
    into the midsections of selected songs.</p><p>
    
    So that's what you're up against: the peculiar sort of dramatic, flower-throwing, cheekily campy pop record British people were making between the day Morrissey went solo and 
    the day Oasis hit U.S. radio, only without loads of references to London neighborhoods whose symbolism you can't parse-- suave crooning, rainy-day pop strumming, cabaret 
    orchestration, melodic guitar solos, lyrics like ""Somewhere someone says they've got it all/ But that's not even what we want/ Not even close."" Made by Canadians. In the 
    twenty-first century. Passably well.</p><p>
    
    If that's the sort of thing you'd like to listen to, you're welcome in my apartment any time. But we will not talk about the Dears. We will listen to Pulp and watch old Smiths videos 
    and throw flowers at one another.  Like common people.</p></div>"|2224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2224-no-cities-left/|6.8|Nitsuh Abebe

    The leading candidates were Sir Porks-A-Lot and Lord Piggington.</p><p>
    
    The reason for our prolonged contemplation?  Aside from this being the first cadaver any of us had ever analyzed, this particular fetal pig had something going for it that even
    Charlotte couldn't have spun a web about.  While everyone else had a run-of-the-mill wee-hog, ours was delivered straight from the bucket with a full-on goatee and
    a wrap-around mark across its back.  He was wearing a black leather biker's jacket.  It was incredible-- our own Hell's Angel Hog-- and we couldn't have such a cool
    pig sporting anything but an appropriately hip and regal name.  For the sake of time, the group eventually compromised and decided on Elvis Pigsley before cutting
    into his lower abdomen.</p><p>
    
    Upon dissection we unfortunately discovered another unsettling surprise about The King: though he looked relatively normal on the outside, his insides were incomplete and
    nonfunctional.  Underdeveloped lungs, esophagus, and intestines, the pig didn't even have a functioning heart.  DOA.  He was lucky to have never seen the outside world; it saved him
    the pain and harm exposure would have inevitably brought in tow.</p><p>
    
    A similar battle between style and substance-- function sacrificed at the altar of maintaining a dim facade of cool-- played out as I listened to Cardia's self-titled debut, released
    by Mike Harbin's (Burning Airlines) new label, Silverthree Sound.  Choosing not to rely upon any epidermal or follicular peculiarities to forge their reputations, Cardia
    instead use the wonderful power of press release hype, which points their sound squarely toward the vicinity of Radiohead, U2, and Jeff Buckley.  The origin of this comparison is more
    than likely linked to the admittedly beautiful voice of Ian Love (formerly of Rival Schools), outfitted in part by the large guitar sound of St. John Scott IV (Shudder To Think) and the
    loping rhythm section comprised of percussionist Andy Action (2 Skinnee J's) and bassist/MENSA candidate Brad Vanderark (The Verve Pipe).  Constituents in place, the group doesn't
    suffer from lack of technical proficiency or musical experience, instead only coming short in the area that one could argue matters the most in pop music: the hook.</p><p>
    
    While it's not antagonistically bothersome that ""Crash"" bears more than a passing resemblance to <i>Bends</i>-era Radiohead-- Love's Yorke-ian coos and sways atop a deeply
    syncopated rhythm and spacey guitar effects-- it is a nagging nuisance that Cardia seems to have taken the wonderful elements of that familiar sound and shunted them into a song bereft
    of any meaty or gratifying catch.  In the same way, ""Stars"" hints at a mellower ""Airbag"" before diving into a neutered guitar line, effectively debasing a tune I could have proudly whistled
    to my grave.</p><p>
    
    Further shrouding themselves in some semblance of seminal UK rock, the band's subject matter tends toward an interpersonal politic that makes wide use of isolationist metaphors and
    relationship analogies.  Once again-- though their heart is in the right place-- Cardia seems to miss the lyrical point: the draw of such themes is the allusion to content, not the dogmatic
    force-feeding of lines like, ""When the feelings come back to me/ I want them gone"" (""Never Feel"").  ""Our Love Is Real"" doesn't redeem the sentiment either in its pithiness--
    ""And sometimes I feel like/ It's alright to be in love""-- made further unpalatable by the Geddy Lee by-way-of Axl Rose vocal delivery, Love stretching the falsetto beyond the
    measure of good taste.</p><p>
    
    The remainder of the album is an experience in relatively unmemorable, guitar-driven tunes, alternately swinging from the back porch bachelor music of ""Sweet Return"" to the
    Vangelis-trapped-in-a-burning-synthesizer sound of ""Fire!"" before finally ending with the digitized music-box lullaby of ""Don't Let Me Down"".  <i>Off-Road</i> isn't
    disagreeable or even bad, but it's absolutely forgettable.  Though they may move on to greater things, for the moment Cardia represent little more than an
    admonition to future bands, a warning against premature presentation, two-dimensional flashiness, and songwriting bereft of blood and guts.</p></div>"|1302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1302-cardia/|5.6|Andrew Bryant

Dickon Hinchliffe may be talking to a character he created, but he may as well be addressing you      directly: that's the effect Tindersticks have.  Even their gentlest moments can grab and startle you, and their fiercest always overwhelm.  These six sad Englishmen have always been beyond classification; you've never heard anything like them, and the things you could compare them with-- Scott Walker, Serge Gainsbourg, spy      film scores, Leonard Cohen, an apocalyptic bar band-- don't make for an easy description.</p><p>Their last two albums settled back a bit from their sharply confrontational, uniquely miserable trio of early works, albums whose sheer brilliance and distinctiveness the band      are unlikely ever to match again.  A readily identifiable R&amp;B influence unexpectedly came to the fore in recent years, and though it suited them nicely, I was admittedly a bit      worried about <em>Waiting for the Moon</em>, which could have very easily seen them losing the plot and slipping into formula.  Instead, it resynthesizes      everything they've done before, and emerges as a cohesive work mirroring the straightforward format of <em>Simple Pleasure</em> and <em>Can Our Love...</em>, all      the while pushing  the music in bolder directions than either of those albums.</p><p>The fact that Dickon Hinchliffe (the band's violinist and orchestrator) sings the first song comes as a bit of a surprise, though not an unpleasant one.  He sounds      kind of like Witness' Gerard Starkie, and his tenor is a good foil to the more familiar, foggy baritone croon of Stuart Staples.  Opener ""Until the Morning Comes"" is a subtle      lullaby, riding David Boulter's tinkling keyboards and a sweeping string arrangement and never rising much above a whisper despite the violence that crops up in the lyrics.</p>
<p>Staples takes the lead back on ""Say Goodbye to the City"", which is a tense, brooding grind of violin, syncopated drums, droning bass and minimalist guitar that explodes into gales of      dissonant strings and frantic trumpet-- it's their most harrowing song since 1997, and it feels great to hear them back in this territory.  Staples turns to a deadpan spoken      narrative on ""4.48 Psychosis"", as the band builds a steadily boiling drone around him, letting drummer Alasdair MacCauley splatter jazz over his rock beat while Hinchliffe's      violin coats everything.</p>
<p>Tindersticks are still pretty heavily set in their soul phase elsewhere, as on ""Trying to Find a Home"" and Hinchliffe's gorgeous ""Sweet Memory""; the way the songs sit on the album,      you can just feel the group constructing them, letting the pieces fall together naturally.  The title track is a pensive music box of strings that gives Staples a perfect bed to shine      on-- his vocals are probably one thing most likely to drive someone away from Tindersticks, but once you've acquired a taste for it, his deeply soulful gutter croon becomes a salve for      all the worst emotions.</p>
<p><em>Waiting for the Moon</em> is just what I needed from Tindersticks: an album that doesn't abandon their recent direction, but breathes new life into it by drawing      breath from their noisier past.  They may operate below the radar of hype and trends-- especially in recent years-- but for whatever public ignorace, Tindersticks are      one of the best bands going today.  I'm more than happy to have their hands 'round my throat.</p>

Most of the big indies-- Creation, Warp, 4AD, Sarah, Tommy Boy, Touch and 
    Go, Drag City, Matador, Mute, and Rough Trade, among others-- had identifiable sounds, common sensibilities, and fairly consistent strike rate. Today I can count the 
    number of labels I somewhat consistently embrace on just two fingers: Soul Jazz (a London-based, mostly reissue label) and Kompakt.</p><p>
    Based in Cologne, Germany, Kompakt was founded by Wolfgang Voigt, and is co-run by Michael Mayer. It cultivates a style of microhouse characterized by a minimalist, textural, 
    and spacious brand of German techno that embraces elements of dub and clicks-and-cuts in equal measure.  In the past year or so, the label hasn't shied away from vocals or 
    more overtly pop song structures...yet almost none of their hallmarks are on <i>Speicher</i>.</p><p>
    The <i>Speicher</i> mix-- primarily drawn from the label's twelve-inch series of the same name-- is considerably more dancefloor-friendly and rooted in traditional house rhythms 
    than anything the label has released previously. Bass-driven, direct and muscular, and completely grounded in 4/4 time, much of the mix belies German techno's recent embrace of electro. 
    Although it's nowhere near as overtly shiny as Kompakt's recent <i>Total 4</i> and virtually free of vocals, <i>Speicher</i> still sounds-- in some spots-- as much like the Hacker 
    or Zombie Nation as it does the Perlon label. </p><p>
    Mayer architects this 70-minute mix, but it's difficult to toss garlands at his feet: he's  arranging tracks from a small pool of records.  That's not a knock on his efforts as a 
    DJ-- displayed on both the near-flawless <i>Immer</i> and a recent Peel Session-- but it should be a point of pride for his work, as a co-label head and ear for talent.</p><p>
    Many of the tracks here are a couple of years old: the mix features a host of Kompakt's more recognizable, longstanding producers. Superpitcher and Reinhard Voigt each supply 
    two tracks; Voigt also collaborates with both his brother Wolfgang (on the sultry album closer ""Vision 03"") and Mayer (on the melodic ""Unter Null""). Our DJ even tosses in 
    one of his own tracks for good measure.  Mayer selects worthy conspirators: T. Raumschmiere's ""Musick"" has a playful, mechanic skip which dances 
    between typical Cologne robotics and the shuffletech sound, and Guentner-- who almost single-handedly rendered the <i>Pop Ambient</i> series unnecessary with his 
    debut album <i>In Moll</i>-- offers the chime-infused ""Regensburg (Wasserman mix)"".</p><p>
    Superpitcher shines brightest here, which is to be expected if you're familiar with Kompakt's output. The unofficial word on <i>die Stra\xDFe</i> is that he'll finally release a full album 
    later this year, but until then, this mix drags a couple more of his tracks onto CD (ten of the 12 tracks first appeared on Kompakt's twelve-inch series, and are available on disc for the first time). 
    Superpitcher's ""Irre"" kicks off the set, with a throbbing bass and crisp, lockstep rhythm not unlike the more restrained sections of Vitalic's <i>Poney</i> EP. Like much of the record's first 
    half, ""Irre"" only layers a few basic sounds on top of one another, but uses them to combine an anthemic drone and the dirty bristle. On ""Fieber"", Superpitcher kicks off the record's more 
    sun-kissed half-- also highlighted by the rolling rhythms of Reinhard Voigt's ""Supertiel""-- with a slice of elastic digital disco that comes closest to echoing the label's famed dub-house beat.</p><p>
    Fittingly, Mayer himself provides the only vocals on the mix, a monotone delivery of Sade's ""Love Is Stronger Than Pride"". Almost unrecognizable when compared to the original, the song's frail 
    sentiment and bottom-heavy throb was first aired on Miss Kittin's cover-mounted mix for the soon-to-be-defunct <i>Musik</i> magazine, an implicit declaration of the track's tangential 
    relationship to electroclash. It's no wonder she embraced it: Mayer is practically doing a Kittin impersonation on vocals.</p><p>
    With so many producers out of their typical elements, there's the worry that many tracks could sound like mimicry. That's not the case, but there's too much of a fish-out-of-water 
    quality to this disc for it to be considered either a topnotch Kompakt release, or a guaranteed floor filler. Trapped between embracing the dancefloor and showing loyalty to the label's 
    typically more sophisticated, layered sounds, <i>Speicher</i> isn't the best introduction to the label-- <i>Total 3</i> and <i>Immer</i> co-own that claim-- but it's a fascinating addition to 
    the still-bulletproof Kompakt roster.</p></div>"|5550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5550-speicher-cd-1/|7.5|Scott Plagenhoef

No matter how El Presidente (not the Domincan BUSCH, mind you) tried and tires to spin it, I refuse to allow my besieged heartstrings to
    be jerked into turgid stands for vengeance, self-righteousness, or freedom forking-over.  While someone will undoubtedly see the cover of German Powerbook
    composer Ekkehard Ehlers' newest and get all Bill O'Reilly-ed up and go running to their gun rack to grab their Toby Keith double-barreled ""Foot in yer Ass/
    Head up Mine"" Equalizer, I am trying to keep a cool head. But the new studio compositions of Ekkehard Ehlers really irk me.</p><p>
    While America xenophobically crawls up its own ass, back-pedaling from treaties, wary of any and all intruders and work visas (back to Kraut-town with you,
    Damo Suzuki), a similar sense of conservativism and movement towards more traditionally classical sounds is at work in experimental music as well. The most glaring
    examples so far this year have been long-incubating new works by premiere electronics composers like Japan's Ryoji Ikeda and Germany's Ekkehard Ehlers that forego
    technology: the former decided that the sound of a rosined bow on strings was so amazing, he tried to make a whole record out of it, and now Ehlers is similarly
    infatuated, adding the sounds of spittled lips on a bass clarinet reed.</p><p>
    A three piece composition for bass clarinet based on the floor plan of the Kunsthalle Schim Frankfurt, ""Mäander"" begins in an eerie, droning rasp,
    the breath of Burkhard Kunkel billowing through the wooden instrument like so many ghosts. Last year's astute observers will remember a portion of Ehlers' <i>Plays</i> dedicated to
    Albert Ayler by way of cut-up cellos, and it's a formula that Ehlers sticks with here. There's a wavering,  wispy sustenance Ehlers grasps at, and sometimes keeps aloft,
    barely revealing the wires he employs to pull off such levitation. At times it reminds me of the similarly focused clarinet explorations that Jimmy Giuffre respired so resplendently
    on his solo flights of fancy in <i>Free Fall</i>. Eric Dolphy's angelic fluttering on ""God Bless the Child"" stirred up in my head as well, as it too moves from melody to \\
    melody, humming through the appartus itself and back in a flicker.</p><p>
    Where these were all about exploration and infinite possibilities in the exquisite, fleeting melodicism of hallowed sound, Ehlers stays stubbornly single-minded, focusing
    on mere textures and extended techniques, layering one breath upon the other until the supposed chamber sound of a woodwind ensemble is achieved. Even the
    collaborative duos of Evan Parker and Lawrence Casserley found a way to take a similar concept of instrument and instant manipulation-- and do it in real time. Even
    with infinite time to process, Ehlers' take can't compare, settling unevenly in places, neither the notes nor their arrangements ultimately cohesive.</p><p>
    ""Blind"" is as troublesome and unimpressive. Also built from cello, the compositional technique employed on the first piece is unchanged, as the
    bowed strings sputter and squeak over one another, bumping into the other 'players' (one player is turned into a quintet) and glitching out. A similar inability to
    gain momentum or sustain an ambiance of any duration leads to its shaky structure and temporality.</p><p>
    Yet all is saved, with twenty-one minutes of yet another artistic homage, ""Woolf Phrase"".</p><p>
    Originally scored for William Forsythe and his dance company Ballett Frankfurt, ""Woolf Phrase"" revisits the ideas put forth in the <i>Plays</i> series, this time focusing
    on the ethereal grandeur from side one of <i>John Cassavetes</i>, looping a curl of strings and pulling it to a sad, sagging
    state of deliberate decay, allowing it to swirl at a slow, languid pace, making for a grave whirlpool of grandiose sounds as immersive and emotionally consumptive as
    the best of his works. Released in a limited edition on his own gallery label Whatness, it makes a greater impact here, vindicating the early meandering.</p><p>
    All three pieces are dated from 2001, which makes me wonder what Ehlers might actually have been up to the last two years. He doesn't foresake his electronics, but he remains elementary in
    his investigations, leaving the deeper compositional problems unresolved. Hopefully it's just a slight pullback before new directions and syntheses of both the technological and
    classical; if anyone, Ekkehard Ehlers is capable of that.</p></div>"|2690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2690-politik-braucht-neinen-feind/|6.9|Andy Beta

    of thick, grainy strums; six seconds in, Guthrie tumbles off the edge of his kitchen chair, dragging his entire patchy, four-track
    setup down with him in a dissonant crunch. Introduction complete.</p><p>
    
    Unsurprisingly, Royal City's Jim Guthrie doesn't exactly fulfill his bombastic (if ill-fated) prophecy, but his solo
    Three Gut debut does boast twenty-four tracks of scrappy, lo-fi maneuvering, littered with all the bells, whistles, and pings expected of
    an artist who records his music in an apartment crammed with unnamed noisemakers.  <i>A Thousand Songs</i> is seventy-four minutes
    of artfully pieced together song collages; to the uninitiated, the prospect of

    record, peppered with bizarre moments of cut and paste genius.</p><p>
    
    Guthrie's sparse, handmade works are lucid enough to save themselves from tedium-- the time-tested pitfall of recording shit
    without a band, producer, or studio-- and he shows an impressive sense of balance and structure, toying with the tension of pairing
    raw, un-tempered sounds with proficient songwriting.  Sometimes blissfully short (could anyone realistically endure more than
    twenty-five seconds of Guthrie and friends hollering ""Rama-lama-ding dong!"" and giggling, or placidly tolerate additional samples
    of someone cawing ""Pots and pans!"" over-- hey, brilliant match-up here-- the crashing of cookware?), Guthrie's samples are usually
    perfectly timed for listener appreciation, and coalesce like a poppier, less DJ-minded Fog.  Remarkably, <i>A Thousand Songs</i> requires
    far less patience than might be (rightfully) anticipated from an artist who currently employs a Playstation as a band member/co-
    songwriter: Guthrie's compositions may be full of noises and unidentifiable hiss, but they're still solidly written songs.</p><p>
    
    Snippets of found sound and cuts from old records (a quick clip from the Statler Brothers' ""Flowers on the Wall,"" a broke-down
    cover of Tortoise's ""Gamera"") mingle peaceably with guitar, drums, keyboards, Playstation-synths, and Guthrie's unadorned
    vocals.  ""The Fantabulous"" opens with rich, acoustic plucks, Guthrie's modest guitar melody stumbling into a light drum and
    cymbal crash and then crawling out, rolling through twitchy beats and cycling back through again, building, breaking down, and
    evening out.  ""Who Needs What"" is a sweet, strikingly sincere acoustic plea, with Guthrie quietly imploring ""Don't back down on
    me now/ I need this/ Go get drunk on me now/ You need this.""  It's a welcome bit of quiet sentimentality before ""Who Needs What"" sees
    Guthrie toss his heart back down, return to form, and holler, ""Shit yeah, I can dance!""</p><p>
    
    Despite being originally released by Three Gut in 1999-- making Guthrie a semi-celebrity with resourceful Canadian critics in
    2000-- and earning a re-release by the label in 2002, <i>A Thousand Songs</i> is terrifically hard to track down stateside, unless you
    frequent Three Gut's website (the label is hoping for U.S. distribution this fall).  Guthrie's scrap-heap gig has already been
    brazenly co-opted by hundreds of crafty, resourceful kids with acoustic guitars and shitty microphones (who probably learned their
    tricks from a well-worn, heavily-stickered tape of <i>Stereopathetic Soul Manure</i>) and unfortunately, much of what's so unique about this
    release will, in all likelihood, seem pretty tired by the time it finds its way into the listening booth of your local indie
    retailer.  But Guthrie's work is more honest and artful than much of the over-posed gimmickry-as-music of his peers, and even now,
    nearly four years after its initial release, <i>A Thousand Songs</i> deserves some attention.</p></div>"|3612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3612-a-thousand-songs/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

His trio, featuring keyboardist Andrea Parkins and drummer Jim Black, have     released as steady stream of records for Swiss avant-garde imprint Hat Hut since 1996, and have just as steadily gained a lofty rep as one of the     most interesting and creative jazz units.  Taking cues from the classic Ornette Coleman quartet of the early 60s, up through the structured improv adventures of     John Zorn in the 80s and on to any number of sounds and beats from today, his group has made the virtually miraculous discovery of playing new jazz that     isn't 1) hopelessly traditional or 2) hopelessly experimental.  In some ways, his music is always contradicting itself-- a tune here with a melody     nicked from the schoolyard is almost uncomfortably straightforward; a piece there threatens to veer off into areas that have no context at all.  Eskelin     pens all his own liner notes, and his hesitancy to ""explain"" what is happening is probably warranted.</p>
<p><i>Arcanum Moderne</i> is the eighth release by this trio, and, like its predecessors, is an excellent example of how vibrant jazz can be in a world     where rock, hip-hop and electronic music are the dominant forms of artistic music expression.  Still, I can't help but wonder if Eskelin might have     helped us out by providing some background.  Unlike last year's incredible <i>12(+1) Imaginary Views</i> or 1998's <i>Kulak 29+30</i>, <i>Arcanum</i> seemingly emphasizes     the abstract-- or at least on Eskelin's more expressive tendencies.  Especially on the final two tracks, ""Half A Chance"" and the title piece, I'd     almost go so far as to say this was as close to free-jazz as the trio had come on record.  Yet, Eskelin foils me in his notes when he talks about     realizing most people weren't used to thinking of sounds in an improvised setting as being ""specific"" or ""intentional.""  Knowing there are structures     at work on his prior albums, I wonder if he's trying to tell me something about this record.  At the very least, it's     most rewarding when you have the opportunity to give it repeated listens, with time to really consider what's happening.</p>
<p>That said, the record begins in typically lighthearted and eclectic fashion with ""It's A Samba"".  What is it?  It's a samba, and also typical     of Eskelin, the melody is simple yet perfectly memorable.  His long tones glide over accordion and Black's deft, busy groove, and the trio once again     finds a way to make sounds in a jazz setting that aren't obviously jazz.  In between verses of melody, Black takes short solos without ever really coming     out of the beat, though on the last statement, Parkins and Eskelin begin their double chorus.  Parkins subtly modulates completely out of the     original key while the saxophone makes various low-key comments in and around the beat.  Midway through, despite Black's persistent pulse, it's     hard to believe this thing started so quaintly.  The band veers almost completely off track just before the climax, when the trio joins Eskelin in     a 4-note repeated pattern, nailing each note with increasingly intense force.  Black attacks his kit for a joyously wild solo chorus, and then the     trio are right back to the beginning.  It might sound scattered, but in the context of the record, ""It's A Samba"" is easily the most traditionally     structured.</p>
<p>""43 RPM"" starts with a bang, with a wail from Eskelin and high-speed rock beat from Black.  Again, the melody is simple, almost minimal, but the solo     breaks are the real blood of the piece.  Black's pulse morphs into manic drum-n-bass and Eskelin plays like a man possessed by both Albert Ayler and     Maceo Parker.  And what do you call this music?  Instrumentation notwithstanding, I'd be hard pressed to say jazz, as hardcore noise-rock     freaks would have just as substantial a claim on it.  Likewise, ""For No Good Reason"" begins with a jittery funk pulse, features extended solo forays by     Eskelin without any hint of being connected to the rest of the tune, and then proceeds to ride out some strange form of torch song led by Parkins'     piano figure owing more to ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" than any jazz standard.</p>
<p>""Half A Chance"" begins on breathy utterances from Eskelin's instrument, unaccompanied by his band mates.  His figures are staunchly anti-melodic,     winding through registers like water running down the side of a very tall building.  He is joined by ambient sounds, possibly emanating from Black's     cymbals, though likely the result of some synth magic.  This queasy atmosphere is maintained until Black crashes in with a few jabs to his toms,     and Parkins whips out her accordion again.  Their interaction is almost violently intense, though just as ""For No Good Reason"" resolved into soft     strokes, here they hit the rock-tinged processional.  The title track seems to go about its way in the same way, beginning with very airy statements     from Eskelin-- in fact, the tune ends very enigmatically with Eskelin ""playing"" nothing more than his own breath through the sax.  Over the course     of almost 15-minutes, the trio investigates multiple textures (assisted largely by the Parkins' array of keyboard sounds and Black's love of     handheld percussion), though with no clear point of reference, it's sometimes tough to know where they're going.</p>
<p><i>Arcanum Moderne</i> is not an easy record to recommend to folks unaccustomed to stuff without many obvious formal signposts.  There is a moment in the title     track, near the end, when the band converges on a single chord and everything seems resolved-- but if you were waiting for fireworks for its     first ten minutes, you might have been disappointed.  Eskelin notes that his audience doesn't really seem to be your typical jazz crowd, and one can only     hope they come out in droves for this.  I'd probably hip beginners to <i>12+1 Imaginary Views</i> first, but ultimately <i>Arcanum</i>'s rewards may very well be     just as sweet.</p></div>"|2832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2832-arcanum-moderne/|8.0|Dominique Leone

These images from the     ""The Fire Sermon"" section of T.S. Eliot's examination of spiritual isolation, <i>The Waste Land</i>, could     easily have been lifted from the expressive lyrics of The Clientele's Alasdair MacLean.  It's no wonder the     English band have taken the title of their long-awaited debut album from Eliot's masterpiece.  In Eliot's     tome, the violet hour is ""When the eyes and back turn upward from the desk/ When the human engine waits/     Like a taxi throbbing waiting.""  It's a time of transition from the shackles of the day to the potential     vibrancy of the early evening, when-- after the drain of work, desperate for rewarding social connections--     we are able to seek emotional nourishment.  Much of <i>The Violet Hour</i> is concerned with this quest,     and seems haunted by the spirits of lost opportunities to experience rich, honest humanity.</p>
<p>The album is also haunted by the sound of the band's string of evocative singles and EPs-- most of which were     previously collected on <i>Suburban Light</i> and the U.S.-only <i>A Fading Summer</i>-- and many of the     band's familiar traits thankfully return here: Alasdair MacLean's languid, almost resigned whisper, his     eloquent lyrics, a slightly out-of-tune guitar, and all of that reverb.  But The Clientele add some new     instrumentation as well-- steel and Spanish guitar, field recordings, violin, chimes-- to create a lush     tapestry of hazy pop, like Felt at their most impressionistic.</p>
<p>The band is given the opportunity to explore the scope and expanse of the album format for the first time     here, and it embraces it, erecting vivid song cycles and mood pieces.  Just as surrealist Joseph     Cornell (a Clientele favorite) frequently updated his boxes of found objects by adding items, so does the     band, adding layers to the ephemeral template established by its earlier work.  Out of character for the Clientele,     ""Lamplight"" and ""The House Alw
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/&lt;script type=""></script>
js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt; ays Wins"" even stretch to upwards of six-and-a-half and eight minutes     respectively, drifting beyond the band's typical hazy psych-folk and unfolding tighter arrangements and     heavier guitar work than ever before.  Also like Cornell, The Clientele dabble in a sort of light surrealism,     the arrangement and cherishing of mismatched images and scattered snapshots.  Their songs are sentimental     collections of memories and moments, some treasured and some lamented, frequently filtered through odd     shades of light and the often-unreliable hazes of memory and nostalgia.  MacLean's delicate, sometimes     poignant, sometimes mordant words of loss and love unfold like a soft-focus slideshow over the band's     swirling, reverb-drenched tones.</p>
<p>A sense of time has always been indicative in much of The Clientele's work, and it continues here.  Check     the titles of songs past and present: ""An Hour Before the Light"", ""As Night Is Falling"", ""Lamplight"", and,     of course, each of their long-playing titles: <i>Suburban Light</i> and now <i>The Violet Hour</i>.     Stepping into the unreal light of The Clientele's violet hour is like looking at faded photos or grainy     film stock, emerging into the daylight following a matinee, trying to peer through the London fog, or     walking into dusk after a day inside artificial light.  It almost <i>sounds</i> the way different shades     of light alter otherwise familiar objects, or the way the experiences of the past, which always seem     extraordinary in hindsight, loom over the present, at which they almost always seem trite.  As a result,     there's a lot of longing here: ""Missing"", ""Everybody's Gone"", ""When You and I Were Young"".</p>
<p>Just as Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i> is credited with helping to define modernism, The Clientele are     marking slight shifts in time, mood and atmosphere.  In combination with their faraway, almost Francophile     sound, it's a poignant noise.  They're capturing moments of transition, loss, or ones that magnify the     banality of the everyday: ""So that summer came and went as I became cold.""  ""I picked her up at half past     four and felt the evening come in her tired eyes.""  ""The first time I saw you, I couldn't say a thing.""     ""I took one step back, and I returned to evening."" ""The southbound train through Battersea in glowing     rain I ride.""  ""I see your face each time I close my eyes.""</p>
<p>So does this record demonstrate growth?  Maybe not.  The Clientele aren't necessarily expanding their sound,     just perfecting it.  Like Cornell, they're collating their collective past, arranging experiences into tight     little boxes to cherish their memories and make sense of them.  They're drifting through the London streets     collecting ephemera, flutters of the heart, and snapshots of dying days.  Like the modernists, they aren't     building a linear timeline but seeking to grapple with more universal conditions.  Is that hopelessly     retrofit?  Some might say so.  Me?  I'm not sure that combating spiritual isolation or seeking emotional     nourishment will ever go out of style.</p></div>"|1504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1504-the-violet-hour/|8.7|Scott Plagenhoef

    line00 ""We never talk about the things we witnessed""-- suggest an album detailing the rural nightmare so many (urban) art-folk songwriters dwell in, where the 
    men are monsters, the women are widows and the graveyards are above average.</p><p>
    But just when the album's ready to fall prey to clichés, it turns into something far more intimate and complex-- moodier, yet more subtle than her previous outings.  
    On last year's excellent <i>The Blackened Air</i>, Nastasia-- an acclaimed New York singer/songwriter in a world that thought it had too many-- wrote songs 
    that were cool and dusty.  Her lyrics confined her as a spectator, or at best, the victim of longings; the action kept happening to other people-- her dad chased a man 
    down the highway, her dog was the one dying violently, and it was always someone else buried in that graveyard.  But on <i>Run to Ruin</i>, the distance dissolves: 
    Nastasia inhabits these songs and slowly surrenders to the material, as the graceful arrangements of her last album become messy and passionate.</p><p> 
    As before, Nastasia matches her acoustic guitar with a striking chamber string section and odd folk instruments like dulcimer, accordion, and no more than twenty 
    notes twinkled on a piano.  The strings grind and weave through ""We Never Talked"" and angrily swell across ""I Say That I Will Do"", while Jim White of Dirty Three-- a 
    perfect drummer for this group-- intuitively balances timekeeping with colors that sputter like rain on soil.  </p><p> 
    The emotions flare and subside, and so do the styles that Nastasia switches between: this is far more exotic than the straighter folk and country stylings of her earlier 
    work, and she's writing longer songs with more room to breathe and swell.  The meaty, gypsy melody of ""On Teasing"", the accordion weaving around 
    the swarthy strings, is as unexpected as the tiny singing and almost too-precious arpeggios on ""The Body"".</p><p>
    But the most striking improvement is her singing.  She's a stronger vocalist, her almost-plain tone rising into higher registers, and her usual range has 
    grown more earthily gorgeous.  But more than anything, she demonstrates a new expressiveness: her singing at an even keel, but around the edges you can 
    hear her start to let go.  Like an anti-diva, Nastasia inches through her feelings instead of flaunting them.</p><p>
    She can sound cutting and ironic, like the dry hatred in ""You Her And Me"", a song whose flat lyrics come to life in a delivery that resembles the smartest loner from high 
    school.  And she's gripping at her most vulnerable: the album's strongest track, ""Superstar"", at first sounds like a reasonable Cowboy Junkies-like ballad, until she 
    draws us in with how lost and helpless she sounds.  She sings the key line ""I'm a superstar"" in a voice that's almost delirious with fatigue, repeating it again 
    and again in weakly ecstatic surrender.</p><p> 
    As with her two other records, Nastasia recorded <i>Run to Ruin</i> with Steve Albini.  Once again he claims he ""documented"" the record instead of producing it, and although 
    it's expectedly close-miked and sonically flawless, Albini gets credit for capturing what happened, then backing off.  It would be too easy, say, to shine up the handful of 
    perfectly sentimental piano notes on ""The Body"", but Albini lets them speak for themselves.  He leaves Nastasia's beautifully arranged ensemble to make its own mood: 
    the dynamic extremes aren't smoothed over, and nobody polishes the mood or smudges this into a genre.  More importantly, nobody tries to be Nastasia's drama 
    coach-- nobody dictated how she should open up on these songs.  While her voice was just a part of the tapestry on her last albums, she has finally become the emotional 
    core, and half the attraction of this record is hearing her stretch out and make these discoveries while we listen.</p></div>"|5712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5712-run-to-ruin/|8.0|Chris Dahlen

    your tight psychological grip on me.  Your worst egregious abuse of my sheltered palate was to make me sign
    that Purchase Obscure Really New Music Only Manifesto (or, PORNMOM). The declaration had its good points: I
    didn't mind offloading Tortoise's oeuvre, and I admit that I bought Dean Wareham products out of a strange,
    sentimental notion of an alternate Boston renaissance. But demanding that we limit ourselves to debuts or
    upstarts was getting ridiculous. Sure, <i>Guitar Romantic</i> is fun, but what exactly about The Exploding
    Hearts is new?</p><p>
    I remain angriest, though, that you pressured me to dump my American Analog Set archives. How I bristled,
    pathetically silent, when you called them ""late-90s drone-turds,"" and said that their album titles connoted
    either children's books or romance novels, building (of course) to your gauche ""riff"" on ""American Anal Log
    Sex."" How painfully I recollect your cackle when I asked if I could at least keep their branch-out material,
    <i>Know by Heart</i> and the remix EP <i>Updates</i>, never expecting you to be such a cropduster about it.
    Whose sticker-clogged clipboard recorded the cool points you scored for noting how one of the remixes sounded
    like a track from Gary Wilson's <i>You Think You Really Know Me</i>?</p><p>
    That you will miss out on the lilting keeper <i>Promise of Love</i> inspires only pity. I grant you, through
    the album's first half, your theory-- that AAS doesn't release albums so much as sequels-- applies. Just as
    ""Punk as Fuck"" kicked off <i>Know by Heart</i> with an elliptical, almost instrumental, ironic nod to genre
    straightjacketism, ""Continuous Hit Music"" offers a self-circumnavigating wedge of cuddle-core that appropriates
    and transcends its titular cliché. (Face it, Chuck, wherever you are, mid-scramble for Datsuns tickets: in
    the era of Colin Powell's huddled-masses-hating scion running the Federal Communication Commission, the phrase
    ""continuous hit music"" is terrifying to approach. This band rebaptizes top-down ""programming"" logic
    beautifully, especially in an acoustic hidden-track reprise.)</p><p>
    I'm not complaining, but ""Hard to Find"" and ""Come Home Baby Julie, Come Home"" also play like <i>Know by Heart</i>
    revamps, their coy keyboards and clean drums seasoning the warm, warm guitar swirl. ""You Own Me"" is a daggum
    culmination of the previous album's make-out succor. This Chet-Baker-does-indie-pop jam could prod the
    urban-legendary beakless chickens of KFC to liplock, but it also made me think of your tyranny, Chuck, since
    it asserts during its breakdown, ""You own me/ Control me.""</p><p>
    Then: look out world, because AAS drops into a mid-tempo trilogy! Begone, all who'd demean this troupe as Low
    &amp; The Family Stone, or as traffickers in Yo La tingle. No shisre, Chuck-- the title track, ""The Hatist"", and
    ""Fool Around"" rank among the year's finest tight-rock salvos from a band nailing itself giddily to the cross
    of its choice, comfortable with its singular personality/idiom; even your precious find, Broken Social Scene,
    suggests a shape-shifting, promethean collision between The Sea &amp; Cake and The Multiple Cat.  These tracks
    float, but scoot, like a jetski with a mute setting.</p><p>
    So go lick a legacy-scab, Chuck. This band of membrane-rangers makes my cuticles throb. The whispered vox
    mirror the guitars' inhaling and exhaling, and the slow-drift song structures are downright platetectonic.
    Yes, the last song's a meandering letdown, and yes, the tone is mannered, like that film you forgot, <i>The
    Deep End</i>-- both works are almost ostentatiously understated.  You might call <i>Promise of Love</i> soft
    and unnecessary, the musical equivalent of foreskin, but as our country inches closer to becoming one big
    cop bar, these forty not-so-new minutes offer overdue comfort. This disc is aural aloe.</p></div>"|156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/156-promise-of-love/|7.9|William Bowers

    This shitty Microsoft accessory tries to sync up every CD shoved up in it with some early 90s rave FX. Right,
    the perfect visual to go with Slayer's <i>Reign in Blood</i> is slowly undulating blue waves, just as the
    ""bars and waves"" setting does so much to enhance listening to Solomon Burke.</p><p>
    In a curious accident that is the exception, I have this minimal green-line circle that bristles and wiggles
    its circumference along to the fourth album of the ongoing postal collaborations between Germany's Harald
    ""Sack"" Ziegler and Frank Schültge Blumm, and it looks about right, even echoing the little line-drawn red
    flowers that are sprinkled around the cover. Simple and quite aware of its shape, the duo are about cute and
    barely digitized movements, the natural rhythms that arise out of their acoustic materials being the
    foundation for each and every song.</p><p>
    Things haven't changed too much from their first release, <i>Shy Noon</i> (on the Gefriem label). And it
    definitely continues the naïf explorations carried out by FS Blumm on his solo release from earlier this year.
    A varying palette of folk instrument curios, ranging from kalimba, tabla, toy piano, mbira, melodica, knitting
    needles, sheet metal, etc. are stroked for simple melodies or fragmented rhythms and then stitched back
    together digitally into little vignettes.</p><p>
    ""Cassius Carrera"" surprisingly recalls fellow countryman and acoustic instrument alchemist Hans Reichel. The
    weird near-vocalized gurgles here, as well as on ""Baby Bass Box"", recall Reichel's most bizarre creation,
    the daxophone, a bowed or tapped sliver of resonant wood that produces ""talking"" qualities that scarcely
    resemble processed vocals, yet retain that nearly human aspect.
    ""Maria Mbira"" is constructed from the thumb plucks of that instrument, mixed with just a dash of early Residents
    horn burp for a mildly discombobulating three minutes of childlike pop. That wobbly walking melody on ""Shop
    Beats"" dreamily recalls the innocent structures graced Nobukazu Takemura's Child's View recordings, but with
    an instrumental array that twinkles like his clear and clement ""perfume"" recordings for Issey Miyake.</p><p>
    Sack und Blumm even bring out some of that thin rubberband funk that Mouse on Mars have played with for
    ""Bass Car"", before winding down with some tin frog throats croaking over a bit of dream organ for naptime.
    With near wordage, ""To Go To"" is a lullaby with the awkward grace that only a father can hum through his nose
    when it's beddy-bye time. Toy motors rev, little red cars grasped at with new hands, and the overall purr of

    jetsetting youth.  And though its combination of breezy melodies and subtle electronic textures often yields gorgeous results, it has doubtless left a few people asking,
    ""Where's my fucking lap-<i>rock</i>?""</p><p>
    
    On their second release, +/- may be on their way to providing a resounding answer to that very question.  Though it relies largely on the laid-back
    charm of its predecessor (the excellent <i>Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut Album</i>), <i>Holding Patterns</i> frequently finds the band taking their sound in new, more
    forceful, kinetic directions.  As a result, <i>Holding Patterns</i> is a less consistently enticing listen than its full-length predecessor, but it's still a lovely EP in its own right
    and, hopefully, a glimpse at what could turn out to be one of the most interesting permutations of the pop-electronic-rock continuum to emerge so far.</p><p>
    
    ""I've Been Lost"" opens with a burst of barely-contained energy before a foundation of crystal-clear acoustic guitar and fuzzy electronic drums gives way to
    blasts of overdriven electric guitar and hyperactive drumming.  Percussion is a big part of +/-'s sound, and the contrast between natural and synthetic drumming is played
    up in ""I've Been Lost"" as well as it has been in any song since the Dismemberment Plan's ""You Are Invited"".  James Baluyut's markedly unspectacular vocals work strikingly
    well here, as the simple, charming melodies he intones hold together the tremendous dynamics that make it so interesting.</p><p>
    
    ""Trapped Under Ice Floes"" is a more straightforward rock song that recalls the dark, glistening tones of the Moles.  Working almost entirely from
    the interplay between layered clean electric guitars, bass, and Baluyut's voice, it occasionally brings to mind the intense emotional deliberateness
    of Interpol, minus the perfectly manifest combination of dread and optimism. Indeed, the most frustrating thing about <i>Holding Patterns</i> is that it often hints at what it never
    fully delivers.  Baluyut's songs are generally pretty straightforward in structure, and have a tendency to return to a familiar chorus right when something incredible seems to
    be in the works.  ""Trapped Under Ice Floes"" is certainly a fantastic song, but it ends awfully close to where it begins, failing to fully capitalize on the momentum of an
    gorgeously tense, subtle midsection.</p><p>
    
    The remaining three tracks on <i>Holding Pattern</i> offer rock takes on the lovely, electronic-inflected pop songs that made <i>Self-titled
    Long-playing Debut Album</i> so great.  While that album was largely Baluyut's own work, <i>Holding Patterns</i> sounds much more like the work of a band in the traditional sense:
    gone are many of the tricked-out lo-fi production quirks of <i>Self-titled</i>, their absence compensated for by more assured songwriting.  ""You've Just Got It All"" is the most successful
    of these tracks, pairing lovely organ and bell sounds with a drumbeat so effective it can only be described as ""catchy.""  As always, Baluyut isn't afraid to incorporate massive
    changes in instrumentation and general tone into a song, and the subdued, electronics-heavy section in the middle of ""You've Just Got It All"" is quite possibly the most beautiful
    thing on this EP.</p><p>
<i>Holding Patterns</i> is a beautiful record, it simply finds beauty in different places than its predecessor.  While <i>Self-titled...</i> worked around
    gorgeous, drawn-out sonic vistas, <i>Holding Patterns</i> shows Baluyut and company are just as adept at finding beauty in motion and interaction.  Though the focus is largely on
    texture and melody, this is far from lap-pop-- it's fully realized rock with enough sonic variety to keep things fresh and interesting.</p></div>"|6355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6355-holding-patterns-ep/|7.5|Matt LeMay

My cat knows simple pleasure-- some days it's a cold wood floor to lie on, other times it's lying like a baggy, inert carpet scrap in the 
    middle of the landing while people are trying to traverse the stairs.  She doesn't really know what it's like to prepare for recreation like we do-- packing stuff in a bag before heading 
    to the beach, or buying tickets to a baseball game and driving forty miles to see it-- and I'm sure she has a lot less stress because of it.  Of course, Abby is a cat, and they're somewhat 
    easier to please than we are, but I think the analogy translates quite well to all aspects of human life, including music.</p><p>
    
    For instance, I can glean a lot of pleasure from something like a Bartok string quartet or a bombastically orchestrated Divine Comedy song, but there are times when all the 
    meticulous planning that goes into music like that just isn't doing it for me, and that's when a disc like this Terminal 4 album comes in.  <i>When I'm Falling</i> is the second release 
    from avant-garde cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm's Terminal 4 project, easily his most easily accessible outlet.  Anyone who knows Chicago music knows Lonberg-Holm's name from 
    the litany of projects he involved himself in the last decade, from Michael Krassner's Boxhead Ensemble, Ken Vandermark's bands, the Peter Brotzman Tentet, Lightbox Orchestra, 
    Lofty Pillars, and just about anything that ever came out on Truckstop, but go back even further, and you'll find him in New York, studying composition with Anthony Braxton and 
    Morton Feldman and drawing fire from his fingerboard in John Zorn's band.</p><p>
    
    Suffice it to say his Out music pedigree is about as good as they come, but everybody needs to retreat from that kind of thing now and then, and Terminal 4 is Lonberg-Holm's escape 
    hatch.  A four piece band features Lonberg-Holm's cello and occasionally piano, Jeb Bishop's wandering trombone, Jason Roebke's demure bass and the spatial guitar of Ben Vida 
    (Town and Country).  The density of Brotzman's tentet is just about the North Pole to Terminal 4's south, as <i>When I'm Falling</i> rarely rises above a simple murmur of two or three 
    instruments.  Bishop's trombone usually leads the way, playing melodies that sound almost stream-of consciousness while the other three musicians whirl slowly behind, coalescing 
    into drones and even hitting the occasional rhythmic stride, such as on ""This Must Be the End"", where Lonberg-Holm's cello kicks up a creaky rhythm before breaking into a searching, 
    plaintive solo.</p><p>
    
    There are moments when Lonberg-Holm is playing at the top of his instrument's range and Vida strums in swaying rhythms that it sounds almost like Reinhardt and Grapelli conducting 
    a lazy midnight jam in a living room.  Dissonance creeps to the fore in short, controlled crescendos, but always gives way quickly to hazy, but consonant melody.  Naturally, the constant 
    instrumentation and mood make for a somewhat monotone recording, and it definitely serves better for atmosphere than close listening, but <i>When I'm Falling</i> proves that, while sometimes 
    it's nice to bust out the orchestra and interlocking sixteenth-note patterns, there are also times when four instruments, honestly played, can say even more.</p></div>"|7974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7974-when-im-falling/|7.2|Joe Tangari

You don't know it yet, but this is your favorite album of the summer.  Shit,
    of this whole foul, corporate-owned, Republican-approved year of our lord, two thousand and three.  What
    MF Doom can do is on par with anyone you can name off the top of your clever, underground noggin', and
    he most likely does it better.  Never mind that his re-entry into the game, <i>Operation: Doomsday</i>,
    was a masterstroke of genre-shaming samples and virgin-tight beats that stood shoulder-to-shoulder with
    Kool Keith's otherworldly approach to hip-hop (while keeping in touch with the asphalt, and digging a
    little deeper, one finger on the trigger and the other checking the TV Guide for B-movies on cable).
    Heads will be discovering that album for the next ten years, and it'll still sound fresh.  So: What to
    do when you've dropped a classic and carved your name in granite after returning to the scene?</p><p>
    First step is to smoke trees, and catch up on your monster movies.</p><p>
    Using the same lo-fi, direct-from-the-VCR dubbing he used to narrate the rise and fall of the iron-faced
    ruler of Latveria on <i>Doomsday</i>, MF lies out the mythos of King Geedorah over the course of <i>Take
    Me to Your Leader</i>, drafting an outline of the rubbery behemoth's exploits (it doesn't <i>quite</i>
    qualify as a concept album), then uses it as a guide to piece together some of the most jaw-droppingly,
    neck-twistingly, brain-meltingly inspired cuts this side of Q-Bert's <i>Wave Twisters</i>. ""Monster Zero""
    is the epicenter of that approach, a cut-n-paste narration of Geedorah's arrival on planet Earth via
    visitors from the future, backed by a languid soul loop and distorted, bizarrely syncopated snares; the
    monster in question-- a mutated, irradiated, three-headed fucker who once terrorized the inhabitants of
    Planet X-- is namechecked and invoked throughout <i>Take Me to Your Leader</i>, and a few of the guest
    emcees hide behind the monikers of other Godzilla friends and foes to cement the theme.</p><p>
    The King Geedorah project, unlike Doom's recent outing as Viktor Vaughn, finds MF almost exclusively behind
    the boards, comfortable with rocking the SP1200 and letting others turn out the mic.  Only two tracks feature
    Doom rhyming, but at least one of them is an album highlight: Along with Mr. Fantastik's GZA-by-way-of Humpty
    Hump delivery and a sleazy, greasy blues guitar, Doom pushes ""Anti-Matter"" straight to the top of the heap.
    Even without Doom's verbal skills, the roster here lives up to Metal Fingers standards, with nary a wack
    emcee in sight (compare that to a record like Peanut Butter Wolf's <i>My Vinyl Weighs a Ton</i>, which
    featured a few lightweights in the pack).  Kurious (billed here as Biolante) sets the bar high on ""Fastlane""
    with an unflappable and confident delivery that fits in amazingly well with the squealing guitar riff that
    forms the track's hook.  In a rare moment of introspection, Hassan Chop does some ruminating on past mistakes
    and lost friends in ""I Wonder"", and it's to his credit that the song is affecting without tripping headlong
    into melodramatic cliché.</p><p>
    ""Next Level"" throws another curveball, eschewing Doom's taste in bizarre source material with a sultry,
    piano-laced jazz groove that hearkens back to early 90s fixtures A Tribe Called Quest and The Pharcyde,
    complimented by lyrics from Lil Sci (""I got a gift called/ Hip-hop prophecy/ 2003/ The year of the jiggy
    emcee""), Stahhr and ID 4 Winds that bring a smooth Black Star flavor to the proceedings.  Gigan takes the
    prize for delivery, though.  ""Krazy World"" finds him delivering couplets at a cross-country runner's pace
    like Jack Kerouac with a dutchie in his back pocket: ""Check it, playin' em/ Bungle them chumps till I
    abolish 'em/ Been doin' it since double-oh-one with five dollars/ We be sparklin' in a Siegfried shirt/
    With wide collars.""  Just as Prince Paul pulled quite a crew together for <i>A Prince Among Thieves</i>,
    MF has enlisted some strong soldiers here, heads that don't find his expansive vinyl universe intimidating.</p><p>
    Kutmasta Kurt and Madlib aside, I haven't heard anyone lace a track like Doom.  Take one listen to the
    Quincy Jones soul loops on ""Krazy World"" or the indelible Motown strings backing Hassan Chop on ""I Wonder""
    and I think you'll agree.  The sharp spacescape of ""Lockjaw"" is straight out of <i>Fantastic Planet</i>,
    right down to the hokey 70s science fiction flourishes and theremin frequencies.  And most of the album
    cuts do double duty, breaking ground in the disjointed rhythm department (""No Snakes Alive""), while bridging
    the gap between the sci-fi themes of King Geedorah and Doom's established jazz tastes (""Fazers"", ""Next
    Level"").  The beatboxing on ""The Fine Print""?  Don't get me started.  And when an emcee just won't do,
    Doom enlists the aid of his crates and the wheels of steel to get his message across.  Besides ""Monster
    Zero""-- which is more a silly-as-shit audio collage anyway-- Doom applies his cut/paste technique to ""One
    Smart Nigger"", exploring racism and linguistic symbolism by letting his wax do the talking.  The effect
    should have emcees checking their notebooks before they attempt another ""socially conscious"" verse.</p><p>
<i>Take Me to Your Leader</i> will excite you in a way most hip-hop projects just aren't able: It's not
    straining for credibility nor putting effort into being revelatory; it just is.  Everyone involved got
    their kicks making this record, and the enthusiasm drips off the jewel case.  Like Bobbitto Garcia says:
    ""Create and share with the world.""  In the album's press release over at Big Dada, MF says: ""You should
    listen to the album for what it is and not expect it to be like the average 'rap' stuff you're probably
    used to... a blend of ill lyrics and instrumentals.  To me, it's way iller than any of the wack shit out
    now.""  And not like you'd expect a chef to say his dishes taste like shit, but this time the horse's mouth
    speaks the absolute truth.</p></div>"|4443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4443-take-me-to-your-leader/|9.0|Mark Martelli

You've seen dozens of musicians
    tagged with it, from Gavin Friday to Gogol Bordello-- all more or less in error. If the term meant
    delivering three-chord anthems in pancake makeup, or simply amping the theatricality, then the best current
    cabaret-punk act would be KISS. Boston's Dresden Dolls supply the genre's true definition: they take
    Weimar chords and Tin Pan Alley wordplay (the latter thematically and linguistically updated to include
    skateboarders and sodomy), and present them with the wide-eyed, fuck-all urgency of vintage CBGB's.</p><p>
    
    Head Doll Amanda Palmer's voice can slide from shipwreck bullhorn to girly twitter and back
    within the same line. To gauge the confused awe she inspires in the listener, you have to think back to
    the first time you've heard air through the vocal cords of Polly Jean Harvey.  Palmer's huge sound appears to
    come almost infuriatingly easy: a natural on stage, she carelessly whispers, sniffles,
    scat-sings, murmurs asides, and frequently cracks up at her own lyrics, all the while playing respectable
    piano.  Mime-faced drummer Brian Viglione supplies tactful brushwork for her verses, and sets 
    mighty tom rolls for grand finales.</p><p>
    
    This is the first time I'm writing a review knowing that the act will be huge. I'm not exactly famous for 
    clairvoyance (having shrugged off Interpol in 1999 with five lines in the Village Voice), so by no means 
    take my word for it. But the signs are all there-- the hypnotically effective live show, the celebrity fans 
    (among them Beck and Perry Farrell), and the long line for crappy homemade demos after each gig.  
    For now, the fame is mostly confined to Massachusetts, where the Dresden Dolls won a battle of the 
    bands and scored admirers at the Boston Phoenix. They have also developed an odd entourage of teenage 
    goths who do ballroom-dancing routines at their concerts (and appear to follow the
    band around the Northeast).</p><p>
<i>A Is For Accident</i> is not the Dolls' proper debut: it's a shrewd feature-length trailer for it, a collection
    of live recordings from the last two years, a handicap to give you a general idea of what you've missed so
    far. This transitional status-- most songs, I'm guessing, are soon to reappear in studio versions-- is
    the only factor that keeps it from a higher rating here.</p><p>
    
    The songs were recorded all over the Northeast, and the quality varies accordingly-- from clean soundboard
    mixes to what sounds like the work of a drunken groupie careening through the crowd with a MiniDisc
    recorder. The immediate standout is ""Mrs. O"", an anthem of denial in 3/4 that recalls ""Hey Jupiter""
    (one of Tori Amos's strongest songs) in its main melody but outdoes Amos on absolutely every other level. The
    oblique horror of the verses (""April trains may bring strange showers"") gives way to the tragic swell of the
    chorus (""The truth can't save you now/ The sky is falling down""). It is haunting, campy and, beyond all
    else, smart.</p><p>
    
    ""Christopher Lydon"" is by all appearances a gag, and a clumsy one at that-- a lovelorn paean to the crusty
    NPR broadcaster who once ran for mayor of Boston. Miraculously, it manages to break your heart. ""Will""
    is a sole studio cut-- an outtake from the upcoming album, recorded in New York with great producer
    Martin Bisi, who, having worked with the likes of Sonic Youth and Swans, knows better than to obscure
    Palmer's voice or to dilute the simplicity of the setup: the big-studio version of the Dolls' sound
    involves a bare minimum of trickery. Bisi adds wisps of harmony vocal, an ambient bed and a couple of
    vintage effect touches to Palmer's slowest and prettiest song. ""Will"" is clearly not a castoff but a
    strategic early unveiling: the pre-single single off a tentative album, by a band whose greatness is
    currently in previews.</p></div>"|2451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2451-a-is-for-accident/|8.4|Michael Idov

Last 
    week, the New Yorker opted to define the genre as a ""sweet, beguiling, never-too-challenging sound which has been a record 
    industry staple from Bing Crosby to Doris Day to Britney Spears.""  While it's smart to classify pop in terms that stretch beyond 
    cleared capital and chart placement, doesn't it also seem myopic to handcuff pop to dopey facility?  It might be bully-fun to 
    call pop naive, but most good pop songs are complex enough to turn banal, everyday suffering into something far more palatable: 
    properly conjured, a pop song is more than capable of translating gnarled, sloppy passions into big, swelling choruses and sticky 
    hooks, making the otherwise intangible pings of being stupid and human not only real, but shiny and pleasant, too.  Behind every 
    successful pop song there's a solid reason to sob; that it actually makes you grin is pop's crucial creative triumph.  Which is more 
    genius than ""sweet.""</p><p>
    
    So calling the Pernice Brothers a pop project isn't the same as economic prophesizing or patronizing their mission.  It's fairly 
    unlikely that <i>Yours Mine &amp; Ours</i>, the Brothers' latest record (self-released on Pernice's own Ashmont label, with, presumably, a modest 
    marketing push) will ever crack mainstream markets, however suitable its calm, soothing melodies might be to blithe summertime 
    cruising (check the 4th of July fireworks on the cover and gnaw a leftover hot dog, Americans).  It's equally unlikely that anyone 
    would find this record ""never-too-challenging.""  But <i>Yours Mine &amp; Ours</i> is driven by the same kind of quirky pop sensibility you'd 
    find in a Top 40 song-- the incessant juxtaposition of reality and fantasy, of rolling heartbreaks up in unbearably light, lush 
    harmonies and amiably cooed bits of poetry.</p><p>
    
    For the most part, the album is straightforward, guitar-driven stuff; nobody crams a fork into the mixer, vintage 
    synthesizers don't disintegrate mid-bridge in a flurry of swooning blips, and Pernice's lyrics almost always make some sort of 
    narrative sense, produced with an unapologetic eye toward polished melodies and clean, sweet finishes.  Unlike the Pernice Brothers' 
    previous two records, which featured loads of gushing strings and some big orchestral bombast, this is also a solid rock 
    effort-- guitars, drums, bass, occasional piano or keyboard, and flawlessly harmonized vocals, exclusively.  Taking a cue from his pitch-
    perfect vocals, Pernice has imbued <i>Yours Mine &amp; Ours</i> with a golden glow reminiscent of classic AM radio and mid-60s Brian Wilson: it's 
    all sunshine and broken hearts. </p><p>
    
    ""Baby in Two"" could sit comfortably on any Elliott Smith album, with its rich acoustic strums and steady percussion, a honey-voiced Joe backing 
    himself in half-whispered laments: ""I wish I knew/ A sure, simple way to reach you/ I'd be the King if I could say to you/ Cut the baby in two."" 
    Pernice's oddly dark (and inarguably bizarre) couplet (dig your own interpretation) eventually shifts into a high, rousing chorus of ""Cut the baby in 
    two!""; ""Baby in Two"" is probably the most pointed example of the Pernice Brothers sneaking an explicitly distressing plea into a sunny, eyes-closed 
    acoustic sigh (this kind of age-old pop mischief is all over <i>Yours Mine &amp; Ours</i>-- ""Number Two"" cheerily admits ""I hope that this letter 
    finds you crying/ Feels so good to see you cry."")</p><p>
    
    Opener ""The Weakest Shade of Blue"" is an impeccably composed, perpetually sparkling string of singalong pop hooks that clocks in 
    at a perfect three minutes; ""Water Ban"" is lilting and strangely addictive, a pastoral rumination on summertime drought (think 
    crispy front lawns, brown patches, and dull, hollow swimming pools: ""It's hard to understand/ The cruel, cruel summer of a water 
    ban"") evoked via rolling guitar and twinkling keyboards. ""Sometimes I Remember"" is a Cure tribute via New Order, marked by a curious 
    stream of backing falsettos and thick, post-punk guitar. Overall, <i>Yours Mine &amp; Ours</i> is strikingly consistent: each track is fully realized, thoughtfully written, and prudently performed, 
    rolled out with a steadiness that can become a little maddening after a handful of listens.</p><p>
    
    But like any successful pop venture, the album can feel a bit formulaic (and, occasionally, laboriously nostalgic): what ultimately saves this record from 
    redundancy is Joe Pernice's stuttering conviction that every word he sings has been dunked in some kind of big, bold truth.  Even 
    those who prefer their pop records scrappier or more aggressively innovative should be able to unearth some kind of slack-jawed, 
    clench-your-fist glee here; instantly impressed or not, it's almost impossible not to eventually uncover something useful in Pernice's 
    intense, earnest dirge.</p><p>
    
    2003 has already seen pop principles well showcased by commercially peripheral bands like the New Pornographers and the Lilys 
    (incidentally, Pernice Brothers bassist Thom Monahan played bass on two Lilys records), who twist pop formula into something smart and 
    occasionally perverse.  On <i>Yours Mine &amp; Ours</i>, the Pernice Brothers have done same.  Pop music edges 
    one step closer to justice.</p></div>"|6237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6237-yours-mine-ours/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

This might seem prolific in the modern sense, but a look at the cover art of her <i>Singles Round-Up</i> lays the intentions of Holly's career pretty much bare: she works something like the early rhythm and blues and country artists she'd appear to love, the sort whose record-store bins are filled with any number of releases packaging singles, standards, sessions, and cross-genre offerings. Holly's personal output of this stuff has overflowed with charming little things\x97but it still feels like her following's extended beyond the usual cultists only far enough to include record store clerks and fellow musicians, all of whom you can imagine loudly complaining about what a shame that is. People like albums these days; how far can you get working like a career singer from 1959?</p><p>
    Well: this year has the potential to change that, though I wouldx92t hold my breath for anything huge. What happened was that Holly's cadre of fellow-musician devotees grew to include the White Stripes, who saw fit to introduce her to a Stripes-sized mainstream audience with a vocal slot on <i>Elephant</i>'s \x93It's True That We Love One Another.\x94 The liner for <i>Truly She is None Other</i> even verges on the mutual backslapping of novelists by including a lengthy joke of a blurb from Jack: \x93Miss Holly Golightly comes to my house sometimes on Sunday, beautiful as the wind that blew her in. . . . Is Holly wool? If she is, then am I a bucket of water?\x94</p><p>
    Given her on-record persona, it's hard to imagine Holly caring much about attention, but this album <i>does</i> sort of sound like she's ready to come out into the light: for one thing, it runs slightly more like An Album than those in her back catalog, and for another, the recording\x97though stripped-down and naturalistic as ever\x97is a thousand times cleaner and more accessible than it's been in the past, like it's put on a nice clean dress for the company. The downside to this is that she sounds like she's on her best behavior; the songs stay awfully polite and sprightly for someone who's so good at sounding sinister. The upside is that underneath that dress, ready to impress strangers, Holly's still pretty near top form.</p><p>
    And Holly in top form has, historically, really been something. Her approach to genre, floatily eclectic as it can be, always comes across as remarkably simple: from the girl-group garage of Thee Headcoatees, where she got her start, Holly drifted over to sounding like both sides of the segregated South. Languid juke-joint blues, department-store calico country, smoky old rhythm and blues and girl-group rock'x92roll; it's all been rendered in the echoing two-microphone style you'd guess from those retro album covers, all soft creaky drum kits and trebly guitar twang and the now-dusty feeling of brightly-covered LPs from Memphis. She doesx92t even \x93cover\x94 other people's songs so much as she sings them like standards, rich favorites for yet another dive bar: Lee Hazlewood, Willy Dixon, or a gloriously evil-sounding Ike Turner run-through (\x93Your Love is Mine\x94) that's right up there with the Shangri-La-rock of \x93Virtually Happy\x94 as one of the high points of her career.</p><p>
    There isx92t, maybe surprisingly, a \x93Virtually Happy\x94 on this more subtle record\x97nor, what with all that damned politeness, a \x93Your Love Is Mine\x94\x97just another set of sly and twangy ramblers and standards, this set touching down twice on the Kinks. But there's her voice, which never really changes and yet must, somehow, because it seems so right in every context, from Patsy Cline to Big Maybelle and mostly something oddly in between: her interpretations of other people's songs arex92t about proving that her record collectiox92s older than yours, but about the seemingly forgotten fact that a good vocal performance rewrites everything that really matters about a song. Jack White rhapsodizes about her singing in the liner, and I'm not sure I'd be able to be much clearer: when that voice meets up with her sharpest lyrics, Holly's moods get exactly as alluring as those of her namesake.</p><p>
    And the songs here, while they may lack the immediate killer, are about as sharp as Holly's been before: perfectly keening girl-group harmonies on \x93Without You Here,\x94 perfectly Staxy r&amp;b; on \x93You Have Yet to Win,\x94 Texan waltz on \x93Sent,\x94 lyrics that giggle and bite. Holly's tunes tend to make the same three points as most torch, blues, and country songs: (a) you're no good, she's glad you're gone, and she might possibly be plotting some form of revenge; (b) she's no good, you'd better get going, and you'd better stay out of her way; and (c) she's no good, you're no good, and maybe that's why she cax92t live without you. You'd be surprised how those stories never get old.</p><p>
    I dox92t know whether that White Stripes cameo will expand Holly Golightly's territory on the indie-rocker's map; I dox92t know whether she can become the Saturday-night whisky-drinking chanteuse or the Sunday-morning armchair crooner of those who arex92t about to thumb through the stacks of old LPs. But if this album really is going to be the outfit Holly's wearing when the company shows up, she should be pleased with herself: it's a little more subdued than many of us might like, but it's awfully presentable. Maybe if we all stick around and bring her enough drinks, she'll loosen back up again.</p></div>"|3510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3510-truly-she-is-none-other/|7.5|Nitsuh Abebe

    cracked, and a couple split singles have literally fallen apart. I'm not usually such a mess with my record collection, but I figure this disrepair 
    rests well within the spirit of the Ann Arbor trio's continually expanding, forever growling discography. Wolf Eyes has fifty-some releases since 1997, 
    and so much music is kind of intimidating if you haven't heard them yet. Like waking up and deciding to dive into one of the hundred or so 
    linked stories and novels comprising Honore de Balzac's <i>La Comedie Humaine</i>. <i>Slicer</i>-- a reissue of a 2001 cassette-only release of the same name-- is a 
    good starting point for the uninitiated: the liner notes list their output up to <i>Slicer</i>, stylistically, it's a Wolf Eyes greatest hits, and 
    more importantly, it's pretty damn solid.</p><p>
    
    I only have a couple bones to pick, actually. At a basic aesthetic level, there are no song titles, which sucks because I always saw those tags as 
    pictograms for or overall description and dissection of each exercise. In the past, ""Burn Your House Down"" from <i>Dread</i> became a call to arms for silly 
    gas huffers and ""Dead Hills"" erupted as the earth-toned backdrop for an empty, mill-whistling middle America, because I had these brief titles 
    as points of departure. The other downer is the first track, a two-minute vocal-splice thing redolent of <i>The Cave</i>, Steve Reich's overwrought Old 
    Testament oratory. Imagining it as perversely manipulated answering machine messages made it creepier and therefore more interesting, but really, it's 
    weak. Maybe it's a warm up for an upcoming remake of Kurt Schwitters' <i>Ursonate</i>?</p><p>
    
    On the upswing-- and what a glorious upswing!-- track two is a variation on the fuzzed-out cicada stomp I've grown to adore: six minutes of splayed 
    horns, crackling tapes, spring-reverb, sputtering shards of salty glass door hinges and that standard high-end knob-twisting that approximates a 
    reconstituted air-raid siren. Track three uses a bass-heavy start/stop burp/blurt that begins too tightly, but shifts to a percussive two-channel 
    palimpsest, which grows increasingly Throbbing Gristle-sinister as the song progresses. Track four's a ten minute complication of a demonic Matmos, 
    stalking the countryside looking for kids to rip apart while archiving the ensuing sounds with well-placed contact microphones. (And the kids who escape could 
    break-dance to the last section of this beauty while dousing themselves with battery acid!) It's as dark and driving as Joy Division or early Swans, and as patently 
    mute as Nurse With Wound.</p><p>
    
    The penultimate track, number six, is a three-minute pop song based on the sounds of the interior of ghosts and 
    shadows. It shifts halfway through, of course, and momentarily sputters and skips into twisted high-pitch noise land before leveling back out to an 
    ominous whisper. The crazed horn at the end doesn't make sense compositionally, but it's a nice exclamation point. Track seven will hurt 
    your dog's ear, I can almost guarantee that. Not much percussion for the coda, just lots and lots of singularly high-end distortion: turn your amp as 
    high as it can go, lean your guitar against the amp, return to the room in five minutes. There you go. 
    
    Besides track one, these pieces are largely 
    without discernible human voices, which is how I prefer my Wolf Eyes: things remain more mysterious that way.  <i>Slicer</i>'s varied palette of 
    late-night creepiness doesn't lean too much towards any stylistic trope, which makes it both a solid introduction and a 
    fine archive to remind you why you fell so hard for these guys in the first place. Coupled with the just-released <i>Covered in Bugs</i> DVD-- an esoteric 
    document offering an off-kilter look into the band's process (as well as a strangely tentative art-house moshpit comprised of giggling teenagers)-- 
    you've got yourself a certifiable Wolf Eyes starter kit!</p></div>"|8728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8728-slicer/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

We were called the Alabaster 
    Pummelers-- APs for short-- and we represented the last line of defense between the dying pangs of winter and the beautiful uprising of spring.  
    Nicknamed the Snow-Kickers by the local press, our mission was to seek out the remaining stragglers of sporadic blizzards and destroy them in 
    a manner befitting seasonal stowaways-- through hard and fast attacks using our feet and hands.  Given an hour, we could lay an entire mountain of 
    powdery whiteness into a mere trickle of its former self, a shivering babe where once there stood a proud Old Man Winter.  Self-appointed and 
    slightly delusional, our job was to deal with the after affects of the storm-- those dirty and unattractive areas where normal people feared to tread-- 
    to discover beauty in violence and power in the monotonous and repetitive exercise of destruction and subsequent conception.</p><p>
    Though I dox92t know him personally, I doubt that Matthew Cooper-- under the working guise of Eluvium-- would have passed up an opportunity to join 
    my friends and I in one of our fierce and inspired outings.  Similar to our oft misunderstood melee, Cooper attests to a brethren musical doctrine of creation 
    over the course of his latest album <i>Lambent Material</i>, utilizing bare and broken shards of noise others are so quick to either throw away 
    or gloss over as putrid waste.  Simple and elegant, the music glides on the strength of progression and volume in the same manner as a poor max92s 
    Philip Jeck-- or Mogwai at their zenith-- providing a cover of any composition from Brian Eno's <i>Ambient</i> series.</p><p>
    ""Zerthis Was A Shivering Human Image"" is the exemplar track by which all others are judged on the album, as it is to best effect what one would 
    expect from the above analogy: a minimal and lulling drone that's easy enough on the ears to be ignored as background music, yet simultaneously 
    capable of closer and constant inspection of its subtle complexity, sound layering and instrumentation.  Over a steady wash of sonic 
    feedback that modulates slowly between piercingly loud and simply deafening, a two-chord motif is left to its own devices, phasing in and out of 
    time with the swells of white noise.  At over fifteen minutes the work comprises nearly half of the album, creating not only a wall of sound but also 
    the rich ornamental tapestries that will adorn it, eventually collapsing into a naturally eclipsing hiss and fade.</p><p>
    Given such a track, it's mind-boggling to wonder why Cooper didn't allot more than a normal pop song's length to the development 
    of his other, neglected compositions.  ""Under The Water It Glowed"" sputters like a fountain as a straightforward and beautiful melody adopts 
    control, ultimately relinquishing its grip to allow a full force siren to rise high in the mix before being cut short of full expansion by ""There Wasx92t Anything"".  
    Developed from a series of clichéd found sounds-- keys falling, coughing, laughing, etc.-- a piano eventually picks up on a three-note repetitive pattern, 
    overtaken quickly by a dark and reedy clarinet.  Though lusciously steeped in room tone and various low-key effects, the track again ends just as 
    it is getting interesting, as if Cooper's intent isn't to provide a complete melodic notion, but simply introduce many curtailed ideas for future reference.</p><p>
    Producing music in such an unforgivable style as Atmospheric Rock must inevitably lead both Matthew and the listener to the observance that 
    short immature compositions-- the aptly titled ""The Unfinished"" and the dark ""I Am So Much More Me That You Are Perfectly You""-- yield an 
    emptiness of expectation that neither rewarding nor forgiving.  Displaying an intense possibility for growth, Eluvium is for the moment nothing more 
    than a catalogue of potential and anticipation, one that will hopefully grow in confidence as well as execution as it ushers in the rebirth of its own stolid 
    fabrication-- a redemptive springtime to combat the detached winter of <i>Lambent Material</i>.</p></div>"|2764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2764-lambent-material/|6.2|Andrew Bryant

    roots.  Authenticity issues still insist the genre is tied to the street, but where a hip-hop province used
    to be as compressed as the South Bronx, it's now as sprawling as the Dirty South.  Even during the dichotomy
    of the pre-<i>Chronic</i> days, when East almost never met West, entire coasts counted as local wards.  Ten
    years later, hip-hop is pop music in America, and its global reach is arguably greater than rock's has ever
    been.  From Missy and Timbaland's tabla to Jay-Z's bhangra beats, The Neptunes' Eastern flavor to dj/Rupture's
    ragga/Nubian/chart-hop mashups and the Diwali-led rise of Jamaican dancehall, U.S. hip-hop is finally engaged
    in a two-way dialogue with the rest of the world.</p><p>
    
    On his debut album, <i>Boy in Da Corner</i>, 18 year-old Dizzee Rascal instantly stakes a claim that East
    London is hip-hop's next great international outpost.  <i>East London</i>: Rascal's world is precisely that
    small, and it returns a sense of rueful perspective to hip-hop lost among the soundtrack tie-ins,
    <i>Godzilla</i>-aping Bone Crusher videos, and 50 Cent-style mixtape mythmaking.  In basic ways, Rascal
    echoes the wish fulfillment of much of American hip-hop, but he's hardly mimicking their act.  Rascal is
    at ground level, eyes trained on his immediate surroundings.  His rhymes, and especially his beats, reflect
    his area's desperate social, economic and political landscape.  Often, this desolation hardens an emcee's
    psyche (Styles gets high every day to combat his mental strain) or delivery: This summer's post-ecstasy
    swing toward punishing sounds and pugnacious looks threatens to bleed the personality, humor, and adventure
    out of hip-hop.  But to wunderkind Rascal, the accelerated disintegration of his immediate world pains him--
    absolutely <i>wounds</i> him-- and it's the Tupac-esque mix of brio and vulnerability, along with his
    dexterous cadence and gutter beats, that separates his rhymes from the typical money/cash/hoes triptych.</p><p>
    
    On the opening track, ""Sittin' Here"", Rascal concludes, ""I think I'm getting weak 'cause my thoughts are
    too strong.""  Over ambient sounds of sirens and guns, he laments, ""It was only yesterday/ Life was a touch
    more sweet.""  Most people Rascal's age crave arrested development, but Dizzee already longs for the
    innocence of childhood.  And yet, the boy in da corner's emergence from adolescence isn't the start of a
    self-imposed purgatory-- life on the dole, or at university-- it's spent cowering, crouching and ready to
    pounce, and most of all, watching.  Little of what he sees is pleasant: a cycle of teenage pregnancy,
    police brutality, and friends lost to the lure of crime and cash (if they're still alive at all).  What's
    perhaps worse: For all of his concern and meditation, Dizzee himself offers few suggestions and little hope.
    He can dish bravado with the best emcees, but despite the eloquent boasts, he remains fragile, apprehensive,
    and consumed by the possibility of failure.  ""I'll probably be doing this, probably forever"" is as
    convincing a career boast as Dizzee can make.</p><p>
    
    The hesitation and anxiety in that claim could also double as a question: whether Rascal will dabble in
    hostility forever.  On ""Brand New Day"", he touchingly wonders if estate violence is youthful folly that he
    and his mates will outgrow.  Over a bittersweet melody that sounds like a blend of an Asian music box and a
    Lali Puna lullaby, Dizzee asks, ""When we ain't kids no more/ Will it still be about what it is right now?""
    For someone with enough of a big-picture grasp to announce that he's ""a problem for Antony Blair,"" there's
    something tragic and poignant about Rascal wondering aloud if settling scores with organized violence is a
    mere child's game.</p><p>
    
    Rascal's curiosity about adulthood and responsibility doesn't, however, extend to fatherhood.  Although
    he has girls on his mind, they're approached with suspicion.  ""Love talks to everyone/ Money talks more,""
    a female emcee insists on ""Wot U On""; ""Jezebel"" laments the cycle of teen pregnancy, blaming a promiscuous
    girl for bringing other future Jezebels into the estate.  And on ""Round We Go"", a ringing ""hey"" (borrowed,
    Just Blaze-style, from The More Fire Crew) echoes the repetition and similitude of a series of loveless
    romantic entanglements sexlessly listed by Dizzee.  Most strikingly, his debut single ""I Luv U""-- recorded
    at the age of 16-- is a he-said/she-said snipe between an unmoved could-be father and a friend of the girl
    that could be ""juiced up.""  It's a harsh amalgam of atonal bleeps and blips, washes of gabba sound, and
    low, harsh bass, fitting for the track's ultimately selfish approach to the impending consequences
    (""Pregnant/ Whatya talkin' about?/ 15?/ She's underage/ That's raw/ And against the law/ Five years or
    more"").  It's among the record's most captivating, visceral moments.</p><p>
    
    It's on ""I Luv U"" that Rascal's sound most nods to the hollow shell of UK garage's end days, just before
    the champagne went dry and the world economy's bubble burst.  UKG's move from feminized, R&amp;B; club music to
    breakbeats and emcee bravado created a thrilling light/dark duality into which So Solid Crew stepped, and
    it seemed as if they'd be the ones to put South London on the international hip-hop map.  When the press
    and record buyers began to ignore UKG in droves in 2001, SSC's strength in numbers (their crew has upwards
    of 20 members) seemed like an urgent plea for attention.  They got it: ""21 Seconds"" shot to #1 on the UK
    charts, which secured for the collective a memorable <i>Top of the Pops</i> appearance, during which almost
    all of their members were crammed onto the BBC studio's bulging stage.  Of course, they were aware that
    the sheer size of their group had benefits as well as limitations: The title ""21 Seconds"" referred to the
    maximum amount of time any one member could spend at the mic on any given track.  This faceless, monolithic
    look and sound provided their music with a rare and unique power, but was eventually their undoing as well.</p><p>
    
    With UKG seemingly left in tatters, Rascal and pirate radio cohorts crawled into the wreckage, reconstructing
    its grimiest bits and blending them with RZA's paranoid minor chords, some off-kilter electro-glitch, the
    low-rent nihilism of Cash Money and No Limit, and the ghosts of ragga-jungle.  Sparse and ugly, Rascal's
    record is an icy orchestra of scavenger sounds, owing as much to video games and ringtones as it does to
    anything more overtly musical.  The despairing beats make the lyrical push and pull that much more severe:
    When Dizzee is venomous, they sharpen his bite; when he gamely searches for the light at the end of the
    tunnel, admits his failures, laments his unraveling psyche, and battles with depression, they seem like
    obstacles.</p><p>
    
    Despite <i>Boy in Da Corner</i>'s garage roots, it couldn't rightly be called ""dance music.""  There <i>are</i>
    still traces of those long-gone days when hyping the crowd or extolling the virtues of the drugs or the
    music were about all a British emcee would provide, but they're nods at best.  On ""2 Far"", a helium-voiced
    claim (""I'm the fitness instructor"") tips its hat to a rave emcee leading a crowd through its all-night
    workout, but now such calls are relegated to the periphery.  Instead, the language-- which had often remained
    subservient to the beat in the UK's previous attempts to grapple with hip-hop (trip-hop, jungle, garage-rap
    circa 2000)-- is the focus.  The point isn't to disconnect from the body, but to train the mind to match
    the speed of thought with the deceptively high BPMs.</p><p>
    
    After a cycle of cynicism, dark humor and despair, Rascal closes the album with ""Do It"", <i>Boy in Da
    Corner</i>'s answer to The Streets' album-closer ""Stay Positive"".  Simultaneously, it's an apology for
    his antisocial behavior, a rallying cry, a confession, and a lucid realization that, despite his age,
    he's already reached the crossroads.  His resistance worn, he admits that he wishes he could sleep forever:
    for days, for years, then ""for good,"" confessing that ""if I had the guts to end it all, I would.""  Like
    he often does throughout the record, Dizzee sounds as if the only thing nearly as bad as dying is having
    been born.</p><p>
    
    Dizzee's despairing wail, focused anger, and cutting sonics place him on the front lines in the battle
    against a stultifying Britain, just as Johnny Rotten, Pete Townshend, and Morrissey have been in the past.
    The difference between the four (and their claims that ""There's no future,"" ""I hope I die before I get old,""
    ""I don't want to wake up on my own anymore,"" and ""I wish I could sleep forever"") isn't as different as it
    might appear on the surface: If Rascal grows at a similar rate, it's not out of the question that he could
    leave a comparable legacy.</p></div>"|2345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2345-boy-in-da-corner/|9.4|Scott Plagenhoef

As a member of Anticon-- the hip-hop collective that bleeds at will into other genres-- it's no surprise for Why? (born Jonathan Wolf) to mix in live instruments or write straight-up songs; he already matched guitar with beats on Miss Ohio's <em>Nameless</em>, and you could call his half of <em>Split EP</em> a kind of song cycle.</p><p>  And yet every time I throw on <em>Oaklandazulasylum</em> it still sounds like the damnedest thing: surprising, confusing, and so wrong it's right.  Ever since Why?, Odd Nosdam and Doseone cut their <em>cLOUDDEAD</em> full-length-- still their biggest claim to fame outside the hip-hop world-- they've been under the gun to cut records that are not only as fucked up as their breakthrough, but as fully-realized, albums where the artists drown you in their desparately individual voices, instead of just passing by in a flash of cleverness. For Why?, <em>Oaklandazulasylum</em> is the first disc since <em>cLOUDDEAD</em> that pulls it off.</p><p>  Producers Odd Nosdam and Jel make guest appearances, but for most of the disc it's Why? who chops up song structure and shuffles arrangements from track to track, fine-tuning the music from every angle.  And from the first song it sounds rich and original, with the guitar, simple percussion and blatting horns that start ""Ferris Wheel"" before it segues to beats and blippy electronics. Why? straddles both camps with total ease. The closest comparison I can make is to The Books' <em>Thought for Food</em> and its similarly organic (and gorgeously captured) mix of sample-based and acoustic music.  Plenty of songwriters back their strumming with drum machines, but Why?'s not diddling with digital perfection: these are heavy, multi-layered beats, some lo-fi and crunchy and others high, bright and almost piercing.</p><p>  On that note, there is a very slight downer, which is that Why?'s vocals may be hard for some to take, a nasal drawl that hits somewhere between Soul Coughing's M. Doughty and They Might Be Giants' John Linnell. I'm not a big fan of Doughty or Linnell myself; fortunately, Why?'s tone isn't nearly as extreme (and certainly not as quirky) as either, and was never enough to distract me from his most impressive performances, or this record's remarkable uniqueness.</p><p>  Why? switches from rhythmic delivery to naked singing, sometimes on a dime. The slight nasal quality of his voice sounds so awkward that he can't help but play it up-- ""Dream on Costelyou"" sounds so unmelodic you can't even believe they let this guy sing-- but witness the brilliantly jerked-out delivery on ""Early Whitney"", where he treats the syllables like a set of steps to jog over.  The almost grotesque, overdubbed harmonies at the end of ""Weak Moon"" sound so warped that they bend your eardrum, but they're perfectly on pitch, and when he turns to a genuinely tuneful voice later on, it doesn't come as a total surprise.</p><p>  On technical terms this may be Why?'s best-realized recording, not to mention the most startling album Anticon has dropped this year.  But the biggest surprise is how engaging it is-- and how much more you connect with Why? after hearing it.  All of the cut-up collages and lo-fi tapes in his prior work were incredibly scattershot, full of distractions that kept his ideas from sticking around.  I can think of more classic Why? lines than full Why? songs, let alone albums.  But this record fleshes out the seemingly non-sequitor lyrics, and makes them resonate. </p><p>  I've ribbed the Anticon artists for their habitual memoir-writing, which, coupled with their surreal left turns can become a non-stop emotional reveal-and-feint.  This time, instead of just dropping clever lines about his dad, he writes ""Afterschool America"", a song so tuneful and lyrically rich it's difficult to imagine how he fit in everything in a minute and a half.  Why?'s geeky personality becomes human, and when he states, ""I'm not myself without my Challenger commemorative button on my brown down vest,"" I can picture the dorky kid who would obsess about a piece of clothing-- hell, I was that dork, too.

Often, it's hard to tell
    who is the actual ""owner"" of the qualities in question.  Example: if a
    jazz drummer with an interest in abstract, improvisational electronic music
    suddenly starts turning out smooth vocal house records then perhaps there's
    an expectation that he would be criticized.  Is this an expectation of the
    audience?  Of the artist to play down his own work?  Of the ""critics""?
    Maybe there's a question of the artist's intent or sincerity.  Maybe the
    identifiable relationship the record has with all of the players in question
    supercedes the need to find links to the tried and true critical vices.
    Finland's Luomo is that artist who would be the focus of an identity crisis.</p><p>
    
    Luomo (aka Vladislav Delay) offers very few easy answers.  Having taken an
    interest in jazz (particularly the sprawling eccentricity of Miles Davis)
    from a very early age, he began his musical career attempting to make a go
    as a jazz drummer.  Though still in his teens, he soon realized he wasn't
    going to make his real statement (or a living) in jazz, and gravitated to
    electronics.  His first recordings retain the adventurous, improvised spirit
    of jazz, but come out like rather dry, experimental ambient.  If he was well
    on the way to becoming a full-fledged IDM technician, it would be another
    one who would de-emphasize the 'D' quotient.</p><p>
    
    All the stranger, then, that he should make a startlingly adept transition
    to house on 2001's <i>Vocalcity</i> (his first release under the Luomo moniker).
    Stranger still that it was received with open arms from most anyone in the
    vicinity.  <i>Vocalcity</i>'s strange brew of clicks, cuts and ultra-suave
    female cooing was an impressive accomplishment for someone admittedly
    unfamiliar with the genre.  What's more, it was the mark of someone apparently
    oblivious to what he was ""supposed"" to be doing, and the result is warm,
    (com)passionate music.</p><p>
<i>The Present Lover</i> continues the experiment, and in general improves on
    it.  Luomo, in typically modest fashion, speaks of the ""panic"" he went through
    recording the vocals on <i>Vocalcity</i>, having never featured any on previous
    releases.  It's a safe bet he isn't panicking now, as the singing here (both
    female and male) is as smooth as it comes.  However, it's also reminiscent
    of thousands of faceless lounge and downtempo compilations featuring
    ""soulful divas"" and androgynous emoting-- and if that's a problem for you (you
    know who you are), <i>The Present Lover</i> might come on a tad strong.
    Still, it fits the cosmopolitan, deeply European tracks to a tee.  Even
    if you've never set foot in a club, the lengthy, passive strains of tunes
    like ""Could Be Like This"" or the title track work just as well as pure
    trance (not the dance kind, er, though you could dance to it).</p><p>
    
    From the beginning of the album, things don't unfold as they should.
    ""Visitor"" is a lush, beatless piece of pop impressionism.  If I didn't
    know better, I'd say Luomo was doing a pretty good job of presenting the
    over-reported sound of Scandinavia, what with its glacial momentum and
    tendency to replace all the rough edges with icy consonance.  The low-key
    chorus of female vocals proclaims, ""I doubt you wanna make me burn,"" and it
    is clearly more of a plea than a prediction.</p><p>
    
    Throughout <i>The Present Lover</i>, passiveness and submission seem like
    attributes rather than easy targets.  Likewise, on ""Cold Lately"", the
    female narrator (longtime Vladislav Delay collaborator AGF) inquires
    ""what makes you so cold at home?"" over near-glitch slow-jam and deep,
    percolating bass as if the mere fact that she cared to ask would make
    everything better.  As the tune progresses, her vocal is overrun by a series
    of computer-generated cuts and pops, but it hardly loses its vulnerability
    (and notice that oozing synth cluster in the background never went away).</p><p>
    
    Several tracks are clearly suited for club play, and would probably work
    wonders for your party as it approaches its final hour.  ""Talk in Danger""
    plays up its midtempo, hi-hat intensive groove while AGF continually
    reassures you that she isn't trying to disappoint you, and goes on a lengthy
    tangent about how ""talking in danger"" helps her find her ability to trust.
    This kind of freeform narrative doesn't seem like it would work in <i>any</i>
    music related to pop, but Luomo's perpetually engaging track makes it seem
    perfectly natural.  The title track features male vocals (likely provided by
    Delay himself), and a punchier beat.  Where it aligns itself more closely to
    straight-ahead house via repetitive hooks and bouncy four-on-the-floor, it
    also manages to slip in non-sequiturs like the bizarre, slinky synth solo
    about three minutes in.</p><p>
    
    ""Shelter"" furthers the energetic feel, but again lapses into strangely
    formless structure as the vocal floats in and out of the mix, sometimes not
    seeming a part of the song at all.  The by-now familiar female chorus offers
    something like a hook, but Delay's background in improvisation colors <i>The
    Present Lover</i> in unexpected ways.  There are no resounding resolutions or
    triumphant cymbal swells here.  There are no recapitulations of a verse or
    concessions to an obvious form.  Just like a modern free music ensemble,
    Luomo makes his mark via an impact delivered over time and through the
    interaction (albeit self-imposed) and modification of the sounds at his
    disposal.</p><p>
    
    There is a decent chance you'll glide right past this record if you've often
    found yourself at odds with house music.  I certainly wasn't terribly enamored
    of the stuff coming into <i>The Present Lover</i>.  But this is an easy album
    to recommend, largely due to it having an impact far beyond the dancefloor.
    Sometimes it just doesn't pay to hang onto old biases, and for now, I'm
    perfectly willing to leave this on repeat if you are.</p></div>"|4928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4928-the-present-lover/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    and asked if we could listen to something softer like, maybe, Wolf Eyes. I misheard, thought she wanted to know if I was listening to Wolf Eyes: ""No, this is 
    Orthrelm."" She responded: ""I know, I have a headache, can we listen to something else?"" I dried my hands of it, and turned off those cloven gods of the 
    dogged riff.</p><p>
    
    This is common domestic drama and you could just as easily switch some variables in the story around. Let's say I'm removing the caked-on grease of 
    coconut tofu cheesecake while playing Lightning Bolt, The Fuckers, or Pink and Brown. I guess Orthrelm's more metal, which fit my mood at the time. 
    Those indie-rock superstars in Lightning Bolt are less rock, more noise. I'd like to keep things of-the-now and The Fuckers broke up ages ago (I only own 
    one of their singles anyway) so fuck that. Of the four options-- just one of a million noisy duos-- Pink and Brown is the most straightforward Rock. Pink 
    uses a duct-taped throat microphone and a single guitar, Brown does drums; they sound like John Spencer might if someone lowered his voice in the mix 
    and kicked him in the stomach during any of his cribbed solos, then proceeded to shave his head.</p><p>
    
    During the band's vaguely chaotic three-year existence they only managed to drop a single full length, 2001's <i>Final Foods</i> on Toyo Records, and a 12"" 
    split with Death Drug on Load in 2002. This could be because they live in separate cities within the golden state: Dwyer in San Francisco and 
    Rosenberg in Los Angeles. Maybe they couldn't deal with the different sensibilities rampant in either overdetermined geography? The tiny output 
    could equally be attributed to their million other projects: John Dwyer's most notably a key player in the Coachwhips and Zeigenbock Kopf (wearing 
    mustaches and acting German with Aaron Aites of Iran) and Jeff Rosenberg plays in the Young People.</p><p>
    
    So what's their deal? If you mention Pink and Brown, chances are some smarmy someone will mention the band's outfits. The colors pink and brown go 
    together nicely. It's a good aesthetic with a fine political undertone referencing Thomas Sowell's 1977 essay ""Pink and Brown People"", which dealt 
    with the polarizing inaccuracies of language used to describe different races. If you want to fixate there, the coolest thing about the outfits is 
    the fake beard sometimes worn by Pink. Though the two already come wrapped in vaguely creepy masks and body suits, Pink for some reason attaches a Walt 
    Whitman looking slab of fluff to the outside of his ski-mask: the artifice is ridiculously apparent, but admirably so. What is it with these duos and 
    uniforms? But come on: they could've only gotten so far if all they had were the tights.</p><p>
    
    Whatever your take, the fairly new 22-track opus,<i> Shame Fantasy II</i>, is a complete discography plus five new songs recorded on New Year's Day 2003 by 
    Dave Brokema of Numbers (There's also a <i>Shame Fantasy II</i> LP, which only has the new live tracks). I have never heard so much Pink and Brown in one 
    sitting; while I admire steadfastness, the sporadic lack of differentiation made me antsy after a while, sometimes undoing the listening session. 
    Because their attack is pretty even tempered and there are no explanatory liner notes provides, you're forced to differentiate time periods within the 
    oeuvre by judging sound qualities and recording set-ups: I won't give these answers away, pretend this is Musician magazine and give those lazy ears of 
    yours a test.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with ""Black Pearl""-- slightly over a minute of spiraling rock-- zoning out on a Tim Green project  filtered through a fan, and ends with 
    ""The Tunnel"", a vacuum-packed two minute  decomposition of guitar rock in a miasmatic sinkhole; it shoves off via a pretty little breakdown part: 
    rat-a-tat and puffs of distorted smoke floating out to sea.  The twenty tracks between mix-up these modalities, adding spaced-out portions of noise 
    ruminations, chipped-away drum solos, upfront salivation, tuneful interludes, pitch-perfect handstands, entropic staying patterns, and layers 
    upon layers of caustic interpolations. By and large, the shit rocks.</p><p>
    
    Maybe you'll like it, maybe you'll hate it, but at least it's all available in one easy document so you can swallow the crust and decide 
    for yourself if there's more to these two than the suave outfits.  Or if you should file under ""one trick pony,"" along with any number of uninspired 
    independent hacks. I loudly lodge a vote for the former.</p><p>
    
    And I plan to spin <i>Shame Fantasy II</i> tonight as I scrub away those goddamn mashed potatoes.</p></div>"|6524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6524-shame-fantasy-ii/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

I can't get enough of them.  The happily-ever-after shtick was frustratingly transparent even when I was 
    prepubescent-- a few years out of the sipper-cup stage-- but now, thanks in part to a completist fanbase and incredibly lean production budgets, I no longer have to second guess with 
    imagination the fate of <i>Aladdin</i>, <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, and, more importantly, <i>Air Bud</i>.  Certainly the storylines are even weaker than the arguably anemic plots of 
    the originals, but just having something-- anything-- to remind me of the childhood pleasure derived from those animated highlights of my innocent years is enough to invite 
    repeated viewing of these oft vapid explorations in cliché and concession.</p><p>
    My predilection has taken hold: I feel the need to slightly alter the label of John Herndon's latest musical outing-- in the name of truth in advertising-- from Missing Dragons to simply 
    Tortoise II: A Grape Dope, a contribution to be enjoyed solely by those still utterly steeped in the mystique of that seminal group.  Though Herndon's A Grape Dope alias doesn't sound anything 
    like his percussive role in Chicago's own terrapin-influenced jazz and post-rock outfit-- after all, sequels rarely stay true to the main focus of the original creation-- but nonetheless, 
    I can assure you this collection of six uninspired tracks will appeal only to the small clique of people who haven't yet taken <i>Standards</i> or <i>TNT</i> out of their 
    CD wallet.</p><p>
    A predictably beat-driven affair, the EP begins with ""Action: Showered Us"", a track geminated but not complimented by the later ""Inaction: Shadowed Us"".  The former begins with a sputtering deep 
    rhythm accented by a high-end hiccup that rises to prominence, only to be interrupted occasionally by Yosemite Sam, cut-up vocals.  A distant clattering is mirrored in the latter track, as a 
    weak melody plays out in the background, rising and falling until it eventually shatters and stops.  Both of the compositions emphasize the studio-experimentation vibe of <i>Missing Dragons</i>: 
    each lends itself more for use as a backing track on an underground MC's lo-fi debut than a stand-alone song captivating in its own right.</p><p>
    Bolstering my damning accusation of inadequacy is the fact that the best cut on the album, ""Red Hat Attack"", is only made listenable by the guest appearance of 
    avant-garde hip-hop artist Doseone, who sing-songs his way through a discussion of two red cars and various abstract images.  A watery beat serves as an adequate addition to the rapper's 
    high-end nasally drawl, before all voices culminate in a spitfire finale of skipping beats and rising tones.</p><p>
    ""When You Crash and Burn"" and ""I'll Spread It"", unfortunately, do not sport a similar musical charm despite being likewise laced with ornate vocal appending.  Featuring an incredibly weak 
    and mechanical rhythm, the tracks are both outfitted by unnecessary oral effects and manipulations, resulting in top-heavy tunes that would invoke spite if they weren't so quickly forgotten.  
    ""Hellz Bellz"" ends Herndon's solo excursion on a less obvious and more sinister note, utilizing a dark pulse to lead the way though his electronic noodling and interestingly more organic beats, 
    this time outfitted with a synthetic drone and some nominally fitting bells.</p><p>
    Though a respected drummer-- one doesn't earn the nick-name ""Machine"" by chance-- John's latest creation is neither for fans searching to get clued-in on Chicago's ailing music 
    scene, nor anyone looking for a resurgence of past glory.  An unappealing release with few redeeming qualities, <i>Missing Dragons</i> will endure an analogous fate with the 
    fairy-tale also-rans mentioned above; a fate that only collectors and diehard fans, biding their time until Herndon returns to his day job, could even remotely enjoy.</p></div>"|3554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3554-missing-dragons-ep/|4.1|Andrew Bryant

    consideration for longevity, reason, or next week.  Then, inevitably, people complain about investing their wads of hard-
    earned dollars on mediocre, wackily-hyped shit that, shockingly, doesn't live up to the quote-laden poster hyperbole decorating the 
    concrete walls of their local record store.  But there's still something kinda charming about occasionally overstated fervor, an 
    intangible giddiness that's reminiscent of pure, unmitigated, guitar-inspired glee.  NME might be completely insane, but it's 
    packed with the kind of blind, unchecked excitement that a lot of other magazines have learned to haughtily avoid in favor of (yawn) 
    detached objectivity.</p><p>
    England's awfully excited about the Kings of Leon this summer, and the Kings of Leon, it turns out, are just excited: hordes of 
    gushing rock writers are stumbling around in a post-Glastonbury glow (the Kings boasted, apparently, a wild second 
    stage set), gearing up to pronounce the Kings rock's new (cringe) royalty.  Stateside, critical pants are still zipped, but the 
    band's already garnered a fair amount of positive mumbling from a handful of journalists, and is tentatively scheduled to release a 
    full-length on RCA in late July (which, in all likelihood, should get the Kings' U.S. publicity machine up and running).  For now, 
    there's <i>Holy Roller Novocaine</i>, a five-song EP; apparently, a fifteen-minute record is adequate evidence for mammoth hyping.  
    This small offering of sincere, blues-based, anthemic Tennessee rock comes care of five guys with the same last name (three brothers-- sons of 
    a Pentecostal preacher-- and one cousin), lots of hair, a couple of mustaches, and super-tight jeans.  Prepare yourself for reading the 
    phrase ""southern-fried"" several thousand times over the course of the summer: rawk has returned (again).</p><p> 
    For all their throwback styling, the Kings of Leon are exceptionally twenty-first century.  Contemporary music has, for 
    the most part, become about ticking off impressive, heavily-annotated lists of influences, and squeezing old sounds into vaguely 
    novel templates; the new game is how well you can pull off the pilfering-- how dynamic you can make a record's re-
    contextualization.  <i>Holy Roller</i>'s five songs mix late 60s garage/psychedelia with sprawling 70s guitar rock, and while the 
    resulting sound is new enough, its underpants are still showing.  It's not hard to see the colors of Kings past here: Steppenwolf, 
    the Kinks, Neil Young, the Band, even skimpy traces of the Velvet Underground.</p><p>
    When the Kings deliberately channel (""Molly's Chambers"" hosts a strategically placed, howl-'till-they-holler-""Freebird!"" guitar 
    solo), they sound more like a diluted Black Crowes than a squad of agile up-and-comers, but when they do edge into more innovative 
    terrain: vocalist Caleb Followill has a rich, nimble rock yell, and lead guitarist Matthew spews the sort of feral wails that classic rock radio 
    stations will shamelessly anoint.  Mostly, though, however the Kings convince because they're just so obviously jazzed to be playing music. </p><p>
    ""California Waiting"" is <i>Holy Roller</i>'s juicy center, the poppiest of the EP's five songs and a catchy (if comparably bland) piece of 
    summertime Petty-pop.  Its good-natured guitar, clean bass, and singalong, speeding-down-the-highway chorus become, after a 
    few listens, a gooey, static reminder of how pop formula can go a little awry in the wrong hands.  The song withers with your increasing attention, 
    despite the band's quasi-noble attempts to inject it with energy.  Happily, ""Holy Roller Novocaine"" is a far 
    more dynamic, freaked-out track, buried in a raucous, semi-sinister fog of lecherous vocals; a thick, bouncy bassline dodges in and out 
    of jangly guitar crashes and creepy lyrics (""Darling, you look lovely/ I've come to lay you down,"" or ""You don't have much I can't 
    take away"").  Here, the Kings successfully pull off cocky posturing over bouncing rock throwdowns. ""Wasted Time"" is a quick, aggressive 
    romp with darting guitars and mumbled vocals; ""Wicker Chair"" is a straightforward acoustic swansong, topped with careful cymbal 
    brushes and lush strumming.  As a quarter-hour buzz, it's all fine.</p><p>
    It's easy to get twitchy about the artfully achieved resurrection of past superheroes, until the recognition of derivation hits, 
    splatters, and gets everything wet.  Kings of Leon aren't nearly as dangerous or as innovative as their influences, but 
    they're likable enough; more importantly, though, the Kings perform their stuff with the same kind of wound-up, unbridled abandon that 
    marks their steamy UK press.  And big, blind enthusiasm has its own sort of appeal: wouldn't you take excited and referential over apathetic and 
    reserved?</p></div>"|4559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4559-holy-roller-novocaine/|7.1|Amanda Petrusich

I am alone,
    the rest of my party having retreated at the sight of some mysterious statues we uncovered about three
    clicks back.  I move faster unassisted.  Pressing through the bush, I stumble upon a yawning blackness,
    the open maw of a darkened cave.  The weak canopy-filtered light penetrates not more than a few feet inside.
    I pause to check a worn parchment map, remove my panama hat, and wipe the sweat from my brow.  I am Harrison
    Ford, I am Brendan Fraser, I am... well, I'm Simon LeBon.</p><p>
    
    Let's talk metaphors here, people.  The treasure I'm looking to rescue is the street cred of Duran Duran as
    an influence.  And the almost certainly booby-trap-filled cave possessing it: the prison of VH1 docu-nugget
    kitsch.  Oh sure, right now Duran Duran are on the sunny side of the retro carousel, what with The Faint
    gothing up their sound, The Rapture channeling their spirit through ""Sister Savior,"" and !!! apprenticing
    at their art of the ass-shake.  And yet, as the fickle gears turn, it's virtually guaranteed we'll once
    again find ourselves in an era of overt synthophobia, and Duran Duran will once again be relegated to
    punchline status.</p><p>
    
    While Duran Duran is probably the first band to come to most anyone's mind when synth-pop is the topic of
    discussion, such an honor has both positive and (usually) negative connotations.  To lump them in with the
    dated remnants of the <i>Vice City</i> crowd is a bit unfair, however; unlike the Korg-heavy environs of
    peers Frankie Goes to Hollywood and A Flock of Seagulls, Duran Duran didn't lean so heavily on the keyboard
    technology of the day.  Rather, they created a unique casserole of club influences, disco basslines,
    pop-crossover melodies, and frontman charisma that, in an ideal world, would be utterly fad-resistant.</p><p>
    
    This new box set containing the group's early singles is not the most convincing evidence around for this
    thesis, what with the band's masterpiece <i>Rio</i> being about as tight a bundle of premium synth-pop as
    this world has ever seen.  Nor is it exactly the most concise way of proving my point to a newbie, weighing
    in as it does at a hefty baker's dozen of discs.  But with each single only comprising three or four songs,
    filling out the headliner with a B-side and a dance mix or two, the set is only a <i>Bond</i> theme over a
    mere three hours' length, and distilled to its key moments, it stands as a more-than-worthy companion to
    the band's essential first phase.</p><p>
    
    In terms of A-sides, the box contains almost all the true essentials, cutting it off before the adult
    contemporary pandering and lineup changes.  The band's more dance-derived debut LP lends the catwalk struts
    ""Planet Earth"" and ""Girls on Film"", but it's the early single version of <i>Rio</i>'s ""My Own Way"" that
    steals the show, full of uptempo disco strings like <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> in fast-forward.</p><p>
<i>Rio</i>, of course, was where it all came together, and singles don't come much stronger than ""Hungry
    Like the Wolf"" or the album's title track.  Both proudly show off how Duran Duran was a band, not just a
    synthesizer: ""Wolf"" threads bubbly keys around a slashing guitar riff; ""Rio"" drops a surprisingly hard
    funk groove behind one of the few times a saxophone solo (as confusingly ubiquitous in the 80s as Mr. T)
    actually worked.</p><p>
    
    By the time we reach <i>Seven and the Ragged Tiger</i>, the Taylor trio + 2 had cooled off their hot streak
    a bit, with only ""The Reflex"" living up to their peak.  ""The Wild Boys"" resides infamously as the only truly
    bad A-side of the thirteen, LeBon straining so hard to express just how wild these boys are that his voice
    outreaches its range.  Fortunately, the finale is reserved for ""A View to a Kill"", one of the better <i>Bond</i>
    songs of the Moore years, where the group chops up the fanfare of John Barry's score in a (dare I say it?)
    glitch-type manner.</p><p>
    
    The assorted dance mixes included are also a perk, excising the majority of the vocals and stretching out
    the songs to the six-to-eight-minute mark.  Most accomplish this through simply slowing unfolding the
    instrumental elements, allowing one to appreciate the gospel choir of ""Union of the Snake"" or the hexagonal
    drumpads of ""Is There Something I Should Know?"" independent of their formerly busy surroundings.  Not too
    many of the mixes turn out significantly more danceable than the originals-- in fact, some are so busy
    showing off the song's inner machinery that they're <em>less</em> likely to get the floor crowded, but in
    sounding a whole heck of a lot like Out Hud, they'll still be greatly appreciated by today's community of
    laptop jockeys.</p><p>
    
    Still with me?  'Cause there are B-sides to discuss as well, though some (""Secret Oktober"", a weak cover of
    ""Fame"") were better off forgotten.  A strange mulligan of <i>Rio</i>'s bizarre sapphire-bullet synth closer
    ""The Chauffeur"" recasts the song as an unplugged Flamenco number, while a live take on UK cult hit ""Make Me
    Smile"" seems to be included just to show off the band's ability to attract screaming girls circa 1984.
    ""Like an Angel"" and ""Faith in this Colour"" are the real archeological finds, though, the first a midtempo
    predecessor to ""Lonely in Your Nightmare"", the second instrumental ""Rockit"" electro begging to be sampled.</p><p>
    
    Halting the collection at the point when the lineup underwent its first of many changes has the unfortunate
    side effect of locking out ""Notorious"", but it's a tough-but-fair tradeoff for a set that ignores the group's
    VH1-friendly incarnation, unlike the other hits collections available.  There's also no denying the thirteen
    discs of <i>Singles 80-85</i> are, in true 80s style, a bit on the excessive side, but the intensity and
    depth of focus on the band's most critical years is a welcome supplement to the LPs in arguing the band's
    eternal relevance beyond video innovation.  And if digging into these 12"" artifacts still leaves you unconvinced
    that Duran Duran were standard bearers for an untapped well of danceable rock, I'll just have to turn over
    some tables in slow motion, LeBon-style, and dance into the fire while you sit and mope.</p></div>"|2486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2486-singles-80-85/|8.3|Rob Mitchum

    listening to them. You hear the band's name and think, ""Ah, that guy Sean
    O'Hagan, who arranges for and plays with Stereolab, he has his own band.
    He worships the 67-72 Beach Boys and is dying to work with Brian Wilson.
    That sounds like an interesting band."" And then you actually put <i>Hawaii</i>
    or <i>Cold and Bouncy</i> on the hi-fi and, well... High Llamas are consistent
    and their records always sound nice, but they're rarely inspiring. Some vital
    spark is missing. Maybe it's O'Hagan's so-so voice, or that his arranging
    gifts outstrip his melodic skill. But High Llamas are a Consistently Slightly
    Better than OK Band, and not a lot more.</p><p>
    
    The two-disc <i>Retrospective, Rarities and Instrumentals</i> collection gathers
    16 of the High Llamas' best songs on its first disc, and 15 additional b-sides
    and import-only bonus tracks on its second. It's an evenly spaced summary of
    the band's roughly ten years of existence, omitting only 2000's Drag City
    Release <i>Buzzle Bee</i> and the seriously underrated remix disc <i>Lollo
    Rosso</i> (""Shotop Hic Hup"" is perhaps Mouse on Mars' best remix).</p><p>
    
    One thing the retrospective disc does particularly well is cherry-pick O'Hagan's
    best melodies. He's released plenty tracks with interesting harmonic movement
    and smartly layered instrumentation, but he hasn't written a ton of great,
    hummable songs. <i>Hawaii</i>'s ""Nomads"" and ""Literature Is Fluff"", <i>Gideon
    Gaye</i>'s ""Checking In Checking Out"", and <i>Santa Barbara</i>'s ""Apricots""
    are all there, for a few moments putting O'Hagan in Andy Partridge's league
    as a craftsman of quirky-but-catchy tunes.</p><p>
    
    The tracks not up to that songwriting standard get by on other virtues. <i>Cold
    and Bouncy</i>'s ""Three Point Scrabble"" and ""Glide Time"" are from a time when
    the High Llamas were finding interesting ways to incorporate squishy electronics
    into their sound (Stereolab's similarly textured <i>Dots and Loops</i> came out
    four months earlier), and the luscious blend of the modular-synth stuff with
    the strings and vocal la-la-la's still sounds great.</p><p>
    
    The b-sides disc is obviously spottier. Culled equally from the same span of
    time as the best-of tracks, the rarities and instrumentals generally offer
    more of the same with slightly lower quality. The instrumentals are for the
    most part decent, but the vocal songs are utterly forgettable. Apparently,
    though O'Hagan undoubtedly can piece together tasteful instrumentals until
    the cows come home, he's unlikely to relegate an excellent song to a b-side.</p><p>
    
    Highlights here include the <i>Snowbug</i>-era ""Beachy Bunch"", which uses a
    broken steel drum as a lead instrument to great effect and features one of
    O'Hagan's more brilliant spare arrangements, and the sweet, swooning ""It
    Might as Well Be Dumbo"". The longer ""suites""-- ""Mini-Management"" and
    ""Cropduster""-- can't justify their runtimes (one is nine minutes, the other
    nearly eight), but ""Janet Jangle"" and ""Over the River"" show that O'Hagan can
    wring a fair amount of interest from extremely simple melodies, especially
    when he's using odd instrumental combinations like banjo, flute and Moog.</p><p>
    
    Like Madonna's <i>The Immaculate Collection</i>, the best-of disc from
    <i>Retrospective</i> is the sort of overview that's almost too well done:
    it sums up the artist's career to this point so completely you have to
    ask yourself whether you need anything more. O'Hagan's interest in ""Let's
    Go Away for Awhile""-type interludes means that High Llamas records always
    have a certain amount of (admittedly relatively pleasant) filler. The first
    disc prunes the dull material and leaves the welcome highlights, so when
    you want a shot of High Llamas, <i>Retrospective, Rarities and Instrumentals</i>
    satisfies completely.</p></div>"|3857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3857-retrospective-rarities-and-instrumentals/|8.0|Mark Richardson

    much as the sounds themselves.  Listener baggage can turn a terrible record into something much more
    palatable, as well as provoking utter disappointment at something that's merely different than what we
    expect.  I would argue that 'listener baggage' is, in actuality, the dominant force when listening to
    music (another column for another time), but in the case of Koroshiya Ichi (or Ichi the Killer), it was
    positively devastating.</p><p>
    
    Karera Musication is apparently a one-off project by most of the members of Japan's Boredoms.  Everyone
    from that band, except ringleader Eye, contributes to the soundtrack of noted shock-violence director
    Takashi Miike's film.  Guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto is the driving force here, with much help from drummer
    Yoshimi P-We, and while the music they've put together for the project is nice enough, it's hardly the
    revelatory explosion I've come to expect from its parent band.  All the elements are there: future-thrill
    electronics, heavy-handed percussion interludes, big, dumb guitar riffing and surprisingly smooth trumpet
    lines-- yet, something is missing.  Could it be that Eye (despite being thanked in the liner notes) is the
    missing spark needed for this band to be exciting?  Could it be that playing 'background music' forces them
    to hold back their usual primal joy?  Probably a bit of both.</p><p>
    
    All of the tracks have Japanese titles, but that's of little consequence as the general ambience is probably
    more important than the names.  The album begins as a series of sound effects, including backwards percussion,
    birds, sine waves and tropical drumming.  This is very similar to recent Boredoms efforts, and I took it
    (prematurely) as a good sign.  The short exposition leads to a straightforward groove track, with more
    tropical percussion, adding a repeated Yoshimi vocal sample and lots of shimmering bells.  Various sound
    effects float in and out of focus, and the mix is fleshed out with soft guitar chords.  It sounds nice, and
    I suppose it is pleasant in its way, but dreadfully unaffecting.  Good soundtracks evoke strong images or
    impressions of a film, and the best ones go beyond this, working as great works unto themselves.  Pleasant
    background music is okay, but unfortunately for Yamamoto and the gang, non-essential.</p><p>
    
    The album's third track introduces a more kinetic frame, with wah-wah guitar, a mellow funk beat and a catchy
    horn line, but is nonetheless easy-listening for Bore heads.  A few tracks up the intensity level ever so
    slightly with comparatively noisy walls of electric guitar and splashy percussion, while others incorporate
    traditional Japanese instruments and a calm, almost reverent atmosphere.  For any longtime Bore-saga followers,
    this is where expectations might get the best of you, though a positive spin might be that it's sort of
    interesting to hear them experiment with unusual textures.</p><p>
    
    The latest rumor is that Yamamoto and bassist Hira have left Boredoms, and Eye and company have formed a
    new band called Vooredoms.  If this is true, Karera Musication could be the last time we ever hear of this
    particular group of people together on a CD.  That would be a shame, because I always thought Yamamoto
    brought a much-needed, punky eclecticism to Boredoms' sound, and this soundtrack hardly does justice to his
    many talents.  Collectors will be interested, but the rest of you should stay tuned for the Vooredoms release.</p></div>"|4389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4389-koroshiya-ichi/|5.0|Dominique Leone

    record seem to indicate that these four tracks might be attempting to disguise the band's raw post-punk
    guitar screeches and no-wave experiments.  If that's the case, though, most of its artists seem to failed
    miserably.  Fortunately, while results vary greatly in both sound and quality, they're all interesting
    variations on the band's well-established themes.  And they'll kill on the dancefloor.</p><p>
    
    Kid606 takes ""Retreat, The Most Familiar"" from the band's forthcoming second full-length, <i>At Crystal
    Palace</i>, and throws in some backwards drum loops and boinging springs that both smack of Siouxsie &amp; The
    Banshees' classic ""Peek-A-Boo"".  The rhythmic hisses and frontwoman Jenny Hoyston's sneered shouts of
    ""Spectre! Spectre!"", however, remain intact. It almost sounds like 606 layered The Fall's ""Spectre Versus
    Rector"" over ""My New House"", resulting in some weird new palimpsest that continually wheels back on itself
    into a digitized dervish.</p><p>
    
    Matmos' Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt take <i>Other Animals</i>' title track into an area of androgynous
    drone jounce that reduces its lyrics into small splices of documentarian-type vocal inflections. It
    surprisingly snaps like latex, the cut-up voices of Lil' Lisa and J. Lesser recalling LaTour's ""People
    Are Still Having Sex"" bumped against some AFX-vox distortion while hundreds of little sounds-- like
    re-booting Windows gongs, ""Beat It"" bongs, and digitized chimp chitters-- get in on the plunderphonic
    orgy.</p><p>
    
    Adult. proves that their electro envelope warping is as sinewy as ever, twisting arpeggiation like prime
    Giorgio Moroder around the <i>Other Animals</i> track ""Marathon"".  Perhaps shockingly, it's Kevin Blechdom
    (late of the notoriously scatological electro-duo Blectum from Blechdom) that offers the most mutilated of
    entry.  On ""Rat Race"", she loops voices into the wobbly moans of an off-kilter carousel, distorting the
    calliope pipes and haphazardly tossing in snippets of bluegrass and squelches of bass, all far afield of
    any distinguishable features of Errata.</p><p>
    
    But no matter the pedigree of the mixers involved here, none (save Blechdom) seem capable of altering the
    barbed and freaky contours of the group beyond recognition, much less take them out any further than the
    band has already gone. Each remixer ultimately sounds like themselves, which is curious, given the band's
    singular features.  There are no extraneous sounds here; neither side is dressing up these paper dolls
    needlessly, nor stripping them down to anything leaner than what they originally were.  It's a tough
    makeover, given the abstract time signatures and unpredictability that the girls swear by.  Fortunately,
    everyone still looks good at the end of the night, even if they are switching sides.</p></div>"|2821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2821-dancing-machine-erase-errata-remix-record-ep/|7.3|Andy Beta

    about to start now. Whenever a reasonably well-heeled
    corporate entity asks me to perform the bizarre act of
    mailing an envelope in an envelope, the pettiness
    makes me shudder. Newcomer Cass McCombs has the
    nerve to request a self-addressed, stamped envelope
    from anyone who wishes to read the lyrics to his debut
    full-length-- and truth be told, I almost complied.</p><p>
    
    Cass McCombs is an intriguing man. His songwriting
    abilities are undeniable but weirdly de-emphasized.
    His reedy voice is either awfully affected (he sounds
    like Procol Harum's Gary Brooker, or like a male Maria
    McKee) or poised to become one of our Great Acquired
    Tastes alongside Robert Smith's meow and Stephen
    Malkmus's yawn. <i>A</i>, while a fine album,
    is full of head-scratching choices; just as its harsh
    lyrics policy can't be explained by financial reasons
    (the inside of the CD booklet is wasted on a large
    Pollockian doodle), some of the production touches are
    just as odd. But it does make you suspect that we're
    dealing with a genius-- one that has yet to be properly
    framed.</p><p>
    
    This music, designed to resist classification, is
    basically (horrors) indie rock, except with a crooning
    pianist at the helm.  Stop before you imagine Ben Folds:
    everything here is solemn and slow, and glistens with
    analog reverb. Shoegazing, with wing-tip shoes. The
    lyrics appear fittingly sad and literate. The album's
    first track, ""The Hospital"", wastes little time before
    imagining the protagonist's demise:  ""I may soon be gone/
    To pluck on a harp/ Like those colored-pencil portraits
    of dogs/ We saw on a blue tarp."" Not sure about the blue
    tarp. Could be Plutarch.</p><p>
    
    Dreamy and disturbing, ""The Hospital"" is a terrific
    song, and folks at Monitor are correct in focussing
    on it as The Single. It also sets the tone for about
    80% of the disc-- literally. Over the course of the
    next ten numbers, there are precious few deviations in
    tempo, style or delivery; the same pall hovers over
    the entire record. ""AIDS in Africa"", meanwhile,
    achieved distinction by annoying me.  Delivering
    the title line in an urbane croon just doesn't work.
    If McCombs is going for Situationist-style semiotic
    disorientation, it's way too convoluted a gag.</p><p>
    
    The two relatively upbeat tracks are ""Bobby, King of
    Boys Town"", which sounds like Blondie's ""The Tide Is
    High"" on 15rpm, and ""When the Bible Was Wrote"". The
    latter, fast by McCombs' standards, is a shaggy piece
    of Western swing with a history lesson for lyrics. If
    not for all the reverb, it could have been the Silver
    Jews.</p><p>
    
    But one frustrating aspect of listening to <i>A</i> is
    trying to gauge exactly how serious McCombs is. Some
    signs point to the possibility that he's a supremely
    deadpan ironist, an indie Robbie Williams come to mock
    the genre from the inside. But, as one of his songs
    defensively puts it, ""A Comedian Is Someone Who Tells
    Jokes"". Cass McCombs arrives in a cloak of fanciful
    ambiguity. It already feels a couple sizes too small
    for him.</p></div>"|5178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5178-a/|7.7|Michael Idov

    slamdancing in his suburban Pennsylvania bedroom, is coming at this whole
    ""authenticity"" thing from a strange angle.  Rather than play up his
    ""hardships"" or overcompensate for a lack of ghetto wisdom, he gets by on
    sheer geekiness and neon indie funk.  That isn't to say Gold Chains should
    retreat back to the server room, because when in doubt, he's more likely
    to lapse into sub Sir Mix-A-Lot machinegun flow than drain a beat with
    glitchy, crystalline tomfoolery.</p><p>
    
    To hear him tell it, the world revolves around only so many things, and
    it's probably a good thing he doesn't list race among them, as it wouldn't
    advance his cause very far anyway.  The long and short of Gold Chains is
    wrapped up in insular, detail-oriented aggression and a recurring love/hate
    relationship with cash money.  Don't look for hard cred where it doesn't
    exist; he's just good, clean fun.</p><p>
    
    Even more than fun, Lafata gets close to home on your ass-- especially if
    you're a young white male with time to burn.  Throughout <i>Young Miss
    America</i>, his debut long-player, he laments love lost over material
    and the fear of a life left empty over the pursuits of money and watching
    the strippers glisten in the sun.  ""Citizens Nowhere, what do you want?""
    he asks his constituency of desperately bored, vaguely ambitious turks.</p><p>
    
    Let him be more specific: ""What do you want from me?""  He makes this inquiry
    in ""Let's Get It On"", in which the Gold Chains position is made perfectly
    clear.  Never mind that he brings in an actual female to testify that it
    ain't all about the cold-hard, this stuff will hit you hardest if you
    either believe everything he says (not likely), or dig the hooks.  This
    album has hundreds of hooks, and I think that's Lafata's way of revealing
    which of his own personal philosophies he holds the most stock in.</p><p>
    
    Gold Chains turns out beats okay, but his tunes might grab your post-production
    fancy-- I counted not less than six complete backing track plan-Bs before the
    chorus on the album's opener, ""Code Red"". Impressively, he manages to pull
    these tricks out of a largely sample-free bag, though what he gains by way
    of a fairly unique sound he often gives right back via arcade-goof organ
    patches and ill-advised lapses into electro-pop when it seems he should be
    turning up the bass.</p><p>
    
    Lafata boasts a ""record with no filler,"" and maybe he's going for the indie
    kids who don't buy the high BPMs, but when ""Several Times Defined"" busts of
    the gate with Farfisa and squeaky clean go-go beats, I get the impression
    I'm not supposed to be laughing at this.  Similarly, ""The Game"" hits the
    razor-sharp jazz piano in all the right places, but lines like, ""I just
    felt some magic, girl, and I think I just might be your type,"" don't seem
    like they'd go well over pogo stick, stop-time two-step.  And they don't.</p><p>
    
    Things get a lot more interesting when Lafata brings out the real guns, as
    on the Spaghetti Western-informed, dancehall romp of ""Nada"".  His voice is
    naturally brutish, so when his ideas and arrangements are kept in focus, the
    Gold Chains growl gathers no moss-- in addition to making his occasionally
    affected Jamaican accent much easier to take.  This tune volleys from
    slow-burn riddim mange to pretty convincing cinematic grandeur (check those
    cymbal crashes, John Williams), but when ""I.O.U. becomes 'you owe me'"" it's
    the beats and Lafata's persistence that sell his already amply stated
    warnings against greed.  He even manages to stay funky for more than one
    verse at a time on ""Revolution"", though that he's stealing chord progressions
    from The Art of Noise probably says more about the record than anything.
    Still, get this man a remix gig for Justin Timberlake, stat.</p><p>
    
    Moments here suggest Gold Chains could be really dangerous should he one day
    choose the big picture over the instant gratification of a thousand new
    directions.  It's not as if <i>Young Miss America</i> is a necessarily
    incoherent experience-- and it certainly sounds like something aimed for
    parties (as opposed to, say, music for computer programming).  In fact, his
    most endearing moments, such as the trashcan suave ""Break or Be Broken""
    (imagine Louis Prima recast as an MC in heat), point to a future as either
    a very entertaining DJ, or the between-girl entertainment at Big Daddy's
    XXX.  One part Busta-lite, and the rest full-on skater bravado: Gold Chains
    isn't going to tear up the world of hip-hop, but he's not totally empty handed.</p></div>"|3496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3496-young-miss-america/|6.7|Dominique Leone

Welcome to Magnetic Park.  We've just finished drawing the pentagram in goat's blood on the floor and we're almost ready to conjure up the seventh level.  What?  Just a ""door-to-door encyclopedia salesman,"" huh?  Well, there'll be no need for encyclopedias where we're going, but I'm afraid you've already seen too much for us to simply let you leave... <em>alive!</em>  OH, I'm kidding.  Relax. You'll only have to stay until the ceremony is complete, at which point you'll hopefully be a true believer like the rest of us.  Now please put this cloak on, say a prayer to the severed head, and prepare your body for the fluid of the infants.</p><p>  Let me just introduce everyone, then.  Those two around the black ring of fire, Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley, are the originators of this sacred music and ceremony you are about to experience, Sunn O)))'s <em>White1</em>.  The individual resting on the mystical stool of the beheaded is Rex Ritter, formerly of such cults as Fontanelle and Jessamine, and to his right is Joe Preston, of Earth and The Melvins, who prepares the accompanying drum machines to our din of sin.  The one awash in his own feces is Julian Cope. He'll be regaling us with one of his famous odes this evening, and hopefully making his exit shortly thereafter.  Between you, me, and the skinned bunny rabbits, he sort of gives everyone here the creeps.</p><p>  It has begun.  Since you are new to the ceremony, I will walk you through the dark and deafening sounds your aura will soon be cleansed with.  The music currently loosening your bowels is the obstinate bass feedback the group is known for in this community.  It serves as the breaker upon which the guitar tremolos crash, giving the duo their distinctive and brooding sound.  Julian arises now to begin his exercise in theatric word painting, ""My Wall"".  It's really quite enjoyable to listen to, and even more fun to recite once one gets past the coquettish nature with which he refers to Anderson and O'Malley.</p><p>  The key to deciphering Cope's abstract speech can be found in the line, ""My wall, my wall, caught beneath the thrall of my wall,"" referring to both the weight of the song and his faux-epitaph-- ""here be the wall of Johnny Guitar.""  Ready?  Repeat after me, ""Old mother-fucker, she was a cock-sucker.""  Isn't he a lyrical genius? And now begins the instrumental outpour.  Be sure and pay attention to how the tonal washes of the electric strings continue to lull you into a false security while the occasional crashes harshly bring you back to the reality of your knocking knees.</p><p>  Don't be frightened, that's only Runhild Gammelsaeter of Thorr's Hammer fame.  She marks the beginning of ""The Gates of Ballard"" portion of the rite by rising from the throne of discarded headcheese.  Her chant serves as the high-end compliment to the single rising tone of instrumentation.  The strong bass kicks in, stalls, and eventually progresses into a rhythm outfitted by a programmed drum, courtesy of Ritter.  This atmosphere is explored off and on for the remainder of the song, until it eventually gives way to ""A Shaving of the Horn That Spared You"".</p><p>  This ""Shaving of the Horn"" track is meant to explore the more experimental yearnings of the dark Lord that oversees all such doom metal.  It pulses at times like a Stockhausen-directed helicopter, with hissing and popping that's occasionally cut by angular guitar noises.  The humming you hear is meant to provide an accented beauty to the harsh sounds and effects that O'Malley and Anderson usher forth from their instruments.

    That disconnect can be crushing, especially when it applies to something as inherently conceptual as sound:
    you know it's just a guitar, but all you see are shadows.</p><p>
    
    Sin Ropas is the brainchild of Tim Hurley (former Red Red Meat bassist and occasional button-pusher for
    Califone) and Chicago percussionist Danni Iosello.  Theoretically, <i>Trickboxes on the Pony Line</i>, Sin
    Ropas' second full-length, isn't strikingly different from what the ever-splintering and coalescing Red Red
    Meat collective (see Califone, Loftus, Perishable Records) have been doing since the mid-to-late 1990s--
    piling up gobs of drone, acoustic and electric guitars, uncredited machines, the occasional banjo, synths,
    noiseboxes, throbbing bass, sonorous percussion, unpredictable structures, largely conceptual lyrics, and
    choruses that may or may not arrive as planned.  Genre transcendence suits Sin Ropas, though, and the dark
    internal cinema of these tracks eclipses, both texturally and atmospherically, nearly all of Hurley's
    previous work, including Sin Ropas' debut, the fulsome <i>Three Cherries</i>.</p><p>
<i>Trickboxes</i> is thick with doubt and hesitation.  Topped by rough, indecipherable vocals and guided by
    a handful of shifting melodies and odd instrumental coups, it's hard to establish a stanch reference point
    for any of the album's eight cagey tracks; the perpetual puzzle is part of what makes this record so
    endlessly intriguing.  Put it on and point yourself toward new, more dynamic modes of aural interpretation,
    shit that has far less to do with mechanically processing a series of notes than with establishing abstract,
    pre-linguistic relationships with art.  Get that the process, like the music, is awkward and uneasy.  Tug
    your stereo outside, curl up in the grass, and chew on some crushed ice. There's gonna be poetry in the
    grasping.  And it will be devastatingly good.</p><p>
    
    ""Hands Aside"" opens with a sequence of neo-natal e-bow squeaks-- each high, sinewy whine promptly gives way
    to aching bass and heavily distorted electric guitar.  Bulky and exhausted, the track packs a limp chorus
    (almost irrelevantly vague, with a half-rousing faux-holler) and a strained apathy reminiscent of Nirvana
    or pre-splits Beck.  But Sin Ropas have a near-supernatural instinct for punch-in-the-gut timing, and there
    are a handful of perfectly positioned notes and chords that can switch your bloodflow with a single missed
    beat.  The band refuses to break mood by taking a deliberate roll out of the song, and ""Butter on Cane""
    slides in behind ""Hands"" unknowingly, as Hurley and Iosello slip unceremoniously into a Dirty Three-ish
    violin melody, quietly scraping over a slow, rhythmic foundation of skittish snare drum and guitar
    drone-gone-madman-noodling.</p><p>
    
    Inspiration works the right way for Hurley and Iosello: bits of folk and blues are thread together with a
    logic that synthesizes (but never imitates) historically proven rock and roll birthrights, delivering
    something both intensely modern and blissfully weird.   ""Floorboards"" is a tragic lurch, loaded down with
    achy, wavering blues guitar that, in the context of the song's ""dirty Christian"" lyrics and hazy production,
    sounds entirely newborn; ""Buried with the Footmen"" sees Hurley's voice and guitar clawing each other for
    attention, pipes finally overtaking the fuzz, Hurley's voice crawling into an onerous, devastating falsetto.</p><p>
<i>Trickboxes on the Pony Line</i>'s abstract song-movies rely heavily on a series of unfixed, user-provided
    images-- pictures replace sounds, sensations supplant rationalizations, everything goes a little blurry.
    Push your fists into your eyes and let the lights come up: what you see on screen is yours.  The rest is
    just guitar.</p></div>"|7176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7176-trickboxes-on-the-pony-line/|8.6|Amanda Petrusich

    Magnetic Fields fandom in the new and impressive McSweeney's spinoff <i>The Believer</i> which contained a
    typically lazy and hyperbolic sentence about his stint opening for the band: ""There is nothing harder than
    trying to bring fiction, literature, words, to the mass audience, even as refined an audience as the one
    that comes to a Magnetic Fields gig.""  Bullshanks!  I and my syphilitic manservant can think of 1.3 million
    things more difficult than being paid to blather one's sub-lofty scribing in the Beirutian gauntlet that is
    Some Metropole's rock club.</p><p>
    
    Yet: a vulnerable cluster of my unplucked heartstrings can sympathize with the
    Moody Fucker (s'a fantastic Lambchop song, download it posthaste), for I have spent a week being all downcast
    about the suckiness of Clem Snide's <i>Soft Spot</i>, as if my no-eye-contact-making doctor had told me I'd
    developed lymphoma of the haircut. ""What's the matter with you?"" my chums ask as I sulk and mix vodka and
    gin to create godka. ""The new Clem Snide ain't no good,"" I reply more morbidly than when I read about the
    Iraqi family killed trying to put out fires in a wheat field that set by Amer'kin flares. O, how fake
    tragedies abound in our leisure federation.</p><p>
    
    During the poet Walt Whitman's autopsy, a lab worker Frankensteinly dropped his brain on his floor, kersplatting
    it. Sometime during the birth of Clem Snide frontman Eef Barzelay's son, Eef's brain similarly slid from its
    post and into history's chumbucket. The once-clever-and-cleverer songwriter has somehow become a saptician
    on par with John Denver. Let's let ""Fontanelle"" speak for itself: ""May the sun always shine on you/ And each
    day feel so bright and new/ And may god hold you in the palm of his hand/ May the moon always light your way/
    And love be forever here to stay/ And may God..."" and then the palm thing again.</p><p>
    
    Is this kind of devolution
    hormonal? Can't a savvy rocker tiptoe onto the frontier of marriage and family without becoming a Mormon?
    Here's more syrup, from (hack) ""Every Moment"": ""Everything that lives will someday die/ But our love still
    grows/ Because every moment must make way for one that's new/ Before it does, remember I love you."" Please,
    Eef, don't hurt 'em! For a response to Mr. Barzelay's epiphany that mortals die and that time passes, I'll
    cite a reviewer of Albert Camus' similarly obvious novel <i>The Fall</i>: ""One might define stupidity as the
    state of needing to be told this.""</p><p>
<i>Soft Spot</i> lacks all that was adventurous/ponderous about Snide's last mega-durable outing <i>The Ghost
    of Fashion</i>. The guitar melodies severely underplink their goal of conveying moist nuggets of enlightened
    bliss. Jason Glasser goes gymkata with the multi-instrumentalism, frontloading this pace-challenged album
    with bells and strings and bloops that suggest ""subtle interplay"" but ultimately register as a kind of
    overcompensation for the lack of gripping songcraft. The scattershot laptop scrackle connotes a <i>Yankee
    Timeshare Foxtrot</i>.</p><p>
    
    Nothing here stakes a claim on the listener's hungry memory with the fury of <i>Ghost</i>'s
    domestic violence vow ""Don't Be Afraid of Your Anger"" or the ironist anthem ""No One's More Happy Than You"".
    Like an NBC-sitcom-theme-spewing doppelganger of John Cusack, Barzelay openly cites Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy
    and Smog as his fave contemporary influences (<i>Ghost</i>'s ""Curse of Great Beauty"" all but presages Oldham's
    ""Careless Love""), yet he over-relies on the preciousness of his sexy-Kermit vocals to carry unrigorous,
    sentimental lyrics.</p><p>
    
    The Rembrandts drums and E Street guitar tone of ""Happy Birthday"" are atrociously cubicle-friendly, ruining
    the song's choice line about Eef wishing his son's girlfriends ""wear tight pants."" Does this band really
    plan to tour to support this Hallmark bore? When will Eef resume his old wordplay, or even his wail? I'd
    rather he go back to wearing his frontal lobe on his sleeve, and interchange ""officer"" and ""orifice,"" or
    point out how ""embargo"" backwards is ""o grab me."" On the album <i>The Known Unsoldier: Sick of Waging War</i>,
    Sage Francis raps a supreme diss about someone's album being so bad that the whole thing should have been a
    hidden bonus track. The slam applies to <i>Soft Spot</i>, which at best begs to be a fan-club download,
    since it offers so little to anyone not Eef's bride or offspring.  ""We'll soon make memories of things to
    come/ Time will pass."" Tell me about it. The future is tomorrow. Peace will come when the fighting stops.</p><p>
    
    Now, I have held a baby, and found it so pacifying and reprioritizing that I dreamt of a world in which an
    hour of baby-holding was a requirement for troubled inner-city youth, to enforce some foggy notion of life's
    sanctity. But then I remembered that many inner-city youths have already squirted kids into the world, and
    they still can't dream beyond the homicidal grudges of their 'hood. So Eef must do more than sing (on ""Close
    the Door"") about how God made the dust that makes his rugrat sneeze.</p><p>
<i>Soft Spot</i> is sweetly conceived,
    but bullyingly so, like disgusting birthday-prompted vegan cookies that one feels bound to eat. It thinks
    its premise is invulnerable, like those Michelin commercials with the babies sitting on the tires that beg
    the question, ""What? Do you hate babies, you shitassed FREAK?"" Some may praise Eef for letting down his
    pun-loving, pop-culture-referencing guard, but this attempt at straight-shooting is so artless that I'm
    filing at as reason #3968 for my lack of faith in upright mammals. ""Let's take off our shoes and dance away
    the blues"": Bob Seger, Jimmy Buffett, Eef Barzelay... feel the oneness.</p></div>"|1499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1499-soft-spot/|2.9|William Bowers

    be an older, broken and seedy Conor Oberst supplement for kids who grew up
    reading used copies of <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> and water-damaged library
    books by Hubert Selby, Jr.  If all the addictions Hart sings about on this
    record are true, he isn't the precocious poet you'd want to bring home to ma
    because he could drop dead any second; if he's invented this stuff then he's
    chosen a more detailed terrain than the oft-times preciously obtuse Oberst,
    more a writer of pretty words than a chronicler of any generation.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Get Well Soon</i>, The Starvations' second full-length, instead of moralizing
    tales of a girl who cries when she plays violin, we have a guy realizing he
    just murdered someone in a drunken haze and a fuck-up leaning on a girl's
    doorbell for two days until he passes out in his car: ""You tripled your
    dosage, washed it down with some rum, you ate all your candy and refused
    to leave me some. Oh you are a shining star, hanging in a sky of tar.""
    Basically: catchy bits about boys who love girls who love drugs who love
    no one.</p><p>
    
    The words I've read thus far about The Starvations compare Hart to Jeffrey
    Lee Pierce of The Gun Club, who died from a blood clot in his brain while
    visiting his pops in Utah. I get the comparison, but Hart has more of
    Oberst's built-in quavering tremolo than Pierce's cool when he shouts and
    wheezes like a dyspeptic drama major about houses of love built of crumbling
    sand. Mix in Robert Smith (Hart even has Smith's spidery hair) and John Doe's
    beat stuff, then back our broken troubadour with The Bad Seeds, The Pogues,
    or 16 Horsepower and you're getting closer to the soul of this scruffy-ass
    stuff.</p><p>
    
    I like Hart's subject matter, his hobo appearance, and his ""Skulls"" vocal
    patterning, but his work isn't perfect. Succumbing at times to lyrical
    fluffiness, he strings together stock images of damage without giving these
    moments three-dimensionality. Because not all of the lyrics gel beyond
    general claims about being high and sad, a number of the songs are similar
    and the constant onslaught of rebel bard gets tiring. For example, ""An
    American Funeral"" begs for a less ceremonious death, telling loved ones to
    avoiding paying to an embalmer-- to save money for a shrink-- promising ""my
    body's well preserved with all the alcohol I drink."" Ho hum? Nick Cave's
    always been good at detailed storytelling, as are Tom Waits and, yeah,
    Jeffrey Lee Pierce. Nope, my generation has yet to unearth its Leonard
    Cohen. (I'd even say Oberst can be a better storyteller, especially in those
    tales of his brother drowning without a name, but the stuff still reeks of
    the sad singer playing tragic.)</p><p>
    
    Like The Pogues, The Starvations are a bar band in the best sense of the
    term: semi-accurate sods kicking up a bluesy dust around loosely tight
    songs about the underbelly of the city. There's enough personality in the
    band's decaying rock arsenal to keep you glued to the crumbling stage for at
    least a chunk of their rag-tag set, just not enough to inspire you to leave
    a tear in your beer or bring their CD home to your depressing apartment.</p></div>"|7483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7483-get-well-soon/|7.6|Brandon Stosuy

    trying to figure out if we're on the verge of a post-rock revival or if the
    stuff just never went away. Everything about this record feels very 1998, a
    time when a thousand bands who listened to a lot of <i>Spiderland</i> decided
    to forego vocals and make variable instrumental density the primary songwriting
    device. Mono formed in 2000, so the timing in terms of post-rock influence seems
    about right.</p><p>
<i>One Step More and You Die</i> is their second album, after debuting in 2001
    with <i>Under the Pipal Tree</i> on Tzadik. Yeah, it's derivative, and yeah,
    we've heard it before, but at least Mono apes the best from the era, capturing
    the crucial drama. Mogwai, for example, completely lost me with <i>Come On Die
    Young</i>, one of the dullest albums I've ever owned. But I've always liked
    <i>Young Team</i>, and it's those sort of soft/loud, tap/crunch dichotomies
    that Mono plays with here. When the guitars kick in, they <em>really</em> kick
    in, with bassy clipping and heavy metal thunder. Nowhere is this more evident
    than on ""Com(?)"", a 15-minute track that could almost be titled ""Mono Fear
    Satan"".  ""Com(?)"", unfortunately, never aims for near that level of poignancy,
    and the central riff is more a stomping power chord than Mogwai's elegant glide,
    but the structure with which Mono explores the hypnotic possibility of a single
    riff is quite close in spirit to the beloved classic.</p><p>
    
    In keeping with their genre's tradition, Mono incorporate occasional strings
    and glockenspiel to add delicacy to the simple, minimalist melodies destined
    to be pounded into the ground by dueling guitars. Only the longer tracks use
    extreme dynamics, though. ""Mopish Morning, Halation Whisper"" sounds like an
    interlude off the first Godspeed album, with violin and piano wobbling at
    variable speed mixed with a bit of vinyl crackle. More Godspeedisms can be
    found on ""A Speeding Car"", which makes heavy use of the <i>Slow Riot</i>-era
    technique of having the band repeat a single progression over and over as
    the lead guitar is strummed on madly on upper-register chords to evoke a cry.</p><p>
    
    These obvious references to other bands don't erase the fact that Mono are
    pretty good at what they do. The guitar melodies, though simple and
    repetitive, are catchy enough, and Mono have a good feel for tension and
    release. I feel like deep down this band wants to be louder and heavier,
    though, because the noisiest moments on <i>One Step More and You Die</i> are
    most convincing. There's a point in ""Com(?)"" where the track is at its peak
    and the tape seems completely saturated and then, from nowhere, an additional
    screaming sheet of feedback comes in and you think, ""Ah, so that wasn't really
    so loud before. <i>This</i> is loud!"" Whereas the quieter, twining guitar
    bits seem much more common. Still, the occasional dull patch aside, <i>One
    Step More and You Die</i> should scratch that '98 post-rocking itch.</p></div>"|5403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5403-one-step-more-and-you-die/|7.0|Mark Richardson

    fronts. This newer, non-rock free-flow <i>nom de plume</i> ostensibly exists for Hoyston to explore unchartered, unhinged experimentation, but considering
    Erase Errata's substantially jarring aesthetic, Paradise Island's unadventurous pillaging of obvious tropes is only ""experimental"" relative to her more
    widely known band. Much like the additive and unnecessary bleeps and buzzes on the Erase Errata remix record <i>Dancing Machine</i>, <i>Lines Are
    Infinitely Fine</i>'s briefly considered sound nuggets feel like simple ideas augmented, rather than focused finalities.</p><p>
    More detrimental to the project, though, is the lack of joy it evokes. A brief segue: I used to work for a minimalist violin player who was really into island
    music. He'd play his guitar along to it, or we'd loop a record and make feedback while folks hit steel drums behind us. It was celebratory, full of
    emotion. We kept our droning luau to ourselves, but tried building a bridge between the discord of the one layer and the lush green expanse of the
    other.</p><p>
    With these memories in mind, I'm not sure I understand Hoyston's project. Where's paradise here? She plays these middle-of-the-road fragments in the
    most distanced and perfunctory manner. The record's lack of an interiority reminds me of Raymond Queneau's <i>Exercises In Style</i>, a book that
    systematically plows through conceits, tense shifts, genres, voices, and of course styles, rewriting the same two-paragraphs 99 times. In a similar way,
    the twelve tracks on <i>Lines Are Infinitely Fine</i> come off like examples of particular approaches, not real-life compositions. Despite what the overload
    of dorks with contact mikes might tell you, successful experimental music is more difficult to make than it sounds. If there isn't enough foresight, even the briefest of
    works can seem like an eternity. This happens too often here.</p><p>
<i>Lines Are Infinitely Fine</i> isn't horrible: it's aggravatingly undistinguished. I was hoping for a warped summertime glare or an odd
    re-take on Hawaiian standards, but instead this sounds like the bored outpourings of an underground indie-rock cynic. ""Mind Wash""-- the aural
    equivalent of a slip-n-slide-- sounds like the late-night outcome of someone who just purchased their first delay pedal and still finds it novel to drop
    words into a mixer, vaguely giddy over the echoey shadows they return.  ""Sunrise A Spectacle"" has a vocal patterning redolent of
    Tattle Tale, minus the histrionics.</p><p>
    I hate to pull out the tired comparison, but I'm also reminded of Kathleen Hannah's Julie Ruin talking about crochet.
    ""I Came 2 Party"" is the requisite, thinly produced faux dance number complete with pitch-shifted voice (the underground's fixation on popular
    dance music is fine and dandy, but come on, even Pink is more interesting than this). ""Try and Leave"" somehow reminds me of the haphazard
    distractions of Smack Dab, a quirky early 90s band fronted by a woman with an insanely twee voice. ""Float on a Flower"" is one of the more upbeat
    tracks, a follow-up to ""Mind Wash"" with its broken balloon CASIO orchestrations.</p><p>
    ""Monster Boogie (Outrageous Dance)"" originally appeared on the <i>Get Up</i> EP released just a couple of months ago and it's the only track that feels complete with
    it's alluring, distant vocals. The final untitled composition is a more lethargic version of \x93Deprogram\x94-- also from the <i>Get Up</i> EP; strangely, the one song
    not included from <i>Get Up</i> is its title track, and it's the best thing Paradise Island's done thus far. The oddly paced ukulele twangs in that one rang out
    like the the Carter Family caught in a dust storm.</p><p>
    I like the concept. I dig the lushly-penned cover art, the rainbow explosions launching from an ink drawing of Hoyston as butterfly (or
    dragonfly). Inside the CD is the handwritten statement: ""Paradise Island is a real place that you can go to right now,"" but beyond the artwork,
    I'm not sure why we'd want to chill there. Hoyston offers slight treasures-- a few worth holding towards the sun, glimmering momentarily-- but for the
    most her part meandering palette is too empty, creating a geographic cipher hardly worth the visit. I felt stranded.</p></div>"|6163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6163-lines-are-infinitely-fine/|5.7|Brandon Stosuy

    snickered about the relevance of a ""sound manipulator"" passing on.  After all, it's not like the guy was
    playing a guitar or bass, right?  But after forging numerous times through the dense <i>De-Loused in the
    Comatorium</i>, the severity of the loss screams blatantly; The Mars Volta focus most of their energy on
    sound manipulation.  Watery vocals, phased synths, reverbed guitars, reversed bongos, and countless other
    dub twiddlings drench each busy, triathlon-long song.</p><p>
    Ward is the second person close to The Mars Volta who has died.  Julio Venegas, a close friend of the band's,
    committed suicide in 1996, and as the media has repeatedly pointed out, <i>De-Loused in the Comatorium</i>
    is supposed to be a chronicle of his life and death.  This is a monumental case of the media blindly reviewing
    off their press kits-- there's absolutely no way of gleaning this story/idea/topic/concept/whatever in the
    hilariously awful, sub-Burroughs, refrigerator-magnet montage of dark PSAT words that make up this album.</p><p>
    The song titles-- ""Drunkship of Lanterns"", ""Televators"", ""Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt""-- merely hint at
    <i>Comatorium</i>'s purblind ""poetry.""  Follow Venegas' footsteps as he makes his ""ritual contrition
    asphyxiation half mast commute through umbilical blisters and boxcar cadavers!""*   Weep while he's ""rowing
    shit smells for the dead""* before the ""pinkeye fountain""* and ""three half-eaten corneas!""*   At least I
    <i>think</i> that's what happened.</p><p>
    The only sensible summation of Venegas' demise seems to be that he proclaimed, ""Now I'm lost,"" then
    ""searched"" for ""something"" for a ""long time,"" then cried ""Is anybody there,"" and finally ""took"" the ol'
    ""veil cerpin taxt.""  Huh.  Reprinting these lyrics in the liner notes might have helped to clarify the
    story, but that could as easily have ruined the experience-- dissecting the cryptic babble is half (or
    more) of the fun.  These lyrics, like At the Drive In's before them, are pure stream-of-consciousness.
    Only now they're delivered in a Geddy Lee castrato, treading helplessly in a tumultuous Great Lake of
    unplotted neo-prog.</p><p>
    ""Inertiatic ESP"", <i>Comatorium</i>'s first real song, stands out as the only memorable track, probably due
    to its succinct, 4\xBD-minute runtime.  Afterward, every song follows a pattern: roar out of the gate with the
    main riff, stop suddenly, float in reverby space where one can hear the smoke machines and laser shows,
    bring back the opening riff with added guitars noodling away, slurp up the noise in a sucking sound, hit the
    pachanga 'n' guitar solo movement, slowly fade in a swarm of dub effects, and, BAM, repeat step one.  Think
    of a San Diego hardcore band.  Think of ALL of the San Diego hardcore bands at once whipping through ELP's
    ""Karn Evil 9"" without practice.</p><p>
    The Mars Volta mistake sonic piling for complex architecture.  No melodic themes are carried.  Often you'll
    find yourself lost in a epic passage of dripping noises (""Cicatrix ESP"") or a robotic bleepdown (""Take the
    Veil Cerpin Taxt"") where the song even forgets itself, before the opening riff and chorus blare back in an
    ""oh, right, this one"" kind of way.  Even acoustic interludes, like the one during the opening of ""This
    Apparatus Must Be Unearthed"", can't pass without Amazon bird recordings and distant e-bow.</p><p>
    Rick Rubin has produced masterfully before-- from the surging density of Slayer's <i>Reign in Blood</i>,
    to the clean funk of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>, to the crisp acoustics of
    Johnny Cash's <i>American</i> recordings.  Here, he's been asked to mix all of the above with added jam
    aplomb.  He must have felt like John Cage telling his disgruntled punk grandsons to ""do whatever.""  Some
    editing and afterthought would have gone a long way.  Each song sounds like if Led Zeppelin had released
    the 25:25 version of ""Dazed and Confused"" off <i>How the West Was Won</i> instead of the concise 6:26 cut
    on their debut.</p><p>
<i>De-Loused in the Comatorium</i> will undoubtedly rekindle prog, or at least spur a reassessment of the
    genre.  Somewhere, kids will proclaim The Mars Volta to sound like Fugazi's <i>End Hits</i> mixed with
    <i>The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</i> (which it <i>sort</i> of does)-- the <i>Comatorium</i> title
    ""Eriatarka"" even sounds like Spanish for ""Aquatarkus""-- but few will confess to actually liking Genesis or
    ELP.  Though The Mars Volta may be prog in the traditional sense, they're in no way ""progressive,"" just as
    The Hives do not record their music in a ""garage.""  So it boils down to whether you're one to cherish the
    originals, keep up with the newbies, or forsake it all as fustian garbage.</p><p>
    The other band often evoked in The Mars Volta press is Santana.  That's just offensive.  Omar and Cedric's
    last names are Rodriguez-Lopez and Zavala, right?  They use bongos? They <i>must sound</i> like Santana!
    That's like comparing Living Colour's <i>Stain</i> to Love's <i>Forever Changes</i>. The percussive break
    on ""Drunkship of Lanterns"" just as shallowly traces back to the Miami Sound Machine.</p><p>
    If any, the album constantly recalled during <i>Comatorium</i> listens is Mansun's 1998 sprawl, <i>Six</i>.
    The seagull-screaming guitar solos on ""Roulette Dares"" mimic Dominic Chad's playing on tracks like ""Negative""
    and ""Shotgun"".  The magic-trick studio transitions sound eerily similar on both records.  Mansun even shared
    The Mars Volta's goal of fusing punk and prog.  The difference: Mansun realized the entertaining bridge
    between the two is glam-rock.  It's a preposterous fusion to begin with, since both genres were originally
    seen as reactions to one another (see: Johnny Rotten's t-shirts), and Mansun barely pulled it off with
    knowing camp; The Mars Volta just straddle the chasm on a cracking rope woven of dour attitude, showers
    of effects, and Latin percussion.</p><p>
    My biggest complaint is that <i>De-Loused in the Comatorium</i> just isn't <i>fun</i>.  Virtuosity-to-a-fault
    was the death of prog in the 70s, but The Mars Volta's aimless hammer-and-wail tactics-- whether performed
    with deep-seeded passion or not-- is just as regrettable.  This record bursts with vim and accelerates
    breathtakingly.  Audiophiles will sop both sides of the headphones for the additive-laden gravy of sounds.
    Cedric and Omar play with such intensity and soul.  What they lack is any ability to convey where their
    passion comes from, either lyrically and musically.  As such, <i>De-Loused in the Comatorium</i> swirls
    around as a galaxy of inexplicable sturm and angst.  If they can find ways to deliver this music convincingly
    and lucidly to their listeners, The Mars Volta might be on to something.</p><p>

    Childs has always seemed older than his years. Even when he was yelping like a poodle, on 1999's <i>Spanish Dance Troupe</i>, his playfulness was offset by mournful songs about
    mortality.  Having already stumbled through a period of summery should've-been hits, he's moving on to works of low-key genius, but Childs-- still only 28-- seems destined to be one
    of the more underappreciated artists of our time.</p><p>
    Recent converts to Gorky's charm can catch up with the band's whimsical, wide-eyed folk-psych days with the recently released (and laboriously titled) <i>20: Singles and
    EP's '94-'96</i>. This collection of four EPs and two singles-- first pieced together for the Brit completists-- picks up two years after the band debuted on the Welsh label
    Anskt, which was also the embryonic home of fellow countrymen Super Furry Animals. Presented in chronological order, it traces GZM's development from passable
    70s garage rockers to mischievous alchemists with a sharp command of melody and harmony, ending just shy of their 1997 album <i>Barafundle</i>, the peak
    of their pop-pysch-prog phase.</p><p>
    When these EPs were originally released, the British press focused on everything about Gorky's except their music: their nationality/language, youth, then-out-of-step influences
    (Canterbury folk, the Beach Boys, Incredible String Band), and their distinctively heinous cover art. Gorky's were painted as your little brother's band, a playful diversion for those
    who hadn't yet grown into Serious Music like, uh, Cast.</p><p>
    Skipping the fetish for fogeyism shared by many of their mid-'90s contemporaries, Gorky's purveyed willful eclecticism in the years compiled here, creating playful, offbeat songs full of odd time
    signatures, and the occasionally unfortunate youthful indulgence. The everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to their music-- trombone, slide, Hammond, nylon guitar, and Moog
    are all used on occasion, but never gratuitously-- extended to Childs occasionally swapping the then-favored Welsh for English, sometimes in the course of one song. Whether
    courting humor on ""The Game of Eyes"" or displaying an early facility for pastoralism on ""Pentref Wrth Y Mor"", Gorky's eager early approach to genre blending makes sometimes-ponderous
    genres like prog, psych, and folk seem infectious and spontaneous.</p><p>
    Although half of these songs appeared on the U.S.-only 1996 compilation <i>Introducing Gorky's Zygotic Mynci</i>, there are still enough reasons for anyone who owns that disc to pick up
    <i>20</i>, and none better than ""Heart of Kentucky"", from the <i>Ambler Gambler EP</i>. The Western pastiche starts with comedic vocals before it inexplicably takes off on a Krautock
    jaunt toward the horizon, sounding like the theme to some Sauerkraut Western. </p><p>
    Only a few years removed from making home recordings, these were still bedroom tapes-- limited releases for a limited audience-- but ideas like the self-explanatory ""12 Explanatory
    Soundscapes""-- which isn't nearly as drip-dry as its title suggests-- are expansive. Locked away from the public eye, working continually with the same sympathetic production and engineering
    team (Alan Holmes and Gorwel Owen), Gorky's formative impulses and giddy, unpredictable approach to songwriting yielded a wealth of rich material in the mid-90s, and they've selected the
    very best for <i>20</i>.</p></div>"|3530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3530-20-singles-and-eps-94-96/|7.8|Scott Plagenhoef

    It's the summer and it's hot, and I like the fact that I have a machine in my house that keeps my brews nice
    and cold. For how awfully dependent we are on machines, and for how often they can screw us over, think
    about how incredible it is that, at any moment, we can log onto the Internet and see a free photo of a
    naked guy or girl, or perhaps both, together. We have machines that, when we put round discs in or on
    them, make pretty fantastic sounds.</p><p>
<i>Player, Player</i> is a celebration of awesome machines, of machines at their most beautiful. The album
    hearts the fact that the metal within, if only because it is touched and molded by our hands, maintains some
    level of our humanity. kpt.michi.gan (aka Michael Beckett, aka the short, bearded third of the Schneider TM
    touring brigade who recently earned a reputation for appearing in the middle of The Faint's set and poking
    the band members in the butt with a microphone stand) does not, as so many other electronic artists do, try
    to create beautiful music despite his electronic machinery. Rather, it's as if Beckett is exploiting the
    beautiful music of machinery itself, recreating what we all might imagine our CD changers, turntables and
    iPods might sound like if microphones could record the melodies and harmonies of the atomic level. Indeed,
    Beckett is ""playing the player,"" and we are privy to one man's vision of the awesome electronic concert
    that happens every time we turn on our stereo receivers.</p><p>
    
    The very first sound we hear on ""Solong S-20"" is a sine tone, harsh and abrasive, before it's subsumed into
    a more deeply lush, slowly pulsating wave. The tone occasionally regains its dominance, but ultimately Beckett
    keeps the wave at the forefront. He moves beyond sound <i>prima facie</i>, and for the rest of the track
    we're amidst those very atomic gears that process sound.</p><p>
    
    Listened to one after the other, ""Jimi"" and ""Derber Papa"" operate as ""Solong S-20"" did, but on a wider and
    more varied scale. ""Jimi"" is thirty-seven seconds of piston-like mechanical pounding (for the complete effect,
    I recommend listening to this on headphones). A romantic type might imagine the sound of a turntable, its
    drive belt slowly turning, the needle being dragged against a record's grooves, occasionally tripping over
    a speck of dust or a piece of hair. It's the least pleasant sound on the album, but its presence is perhaps
    most important: without the sonic nit and grit of machines, we cannot have-- let alone appreciate-- the more
    beautiful ones that we demand from them.</p><p>
    
    The abrasiveness of ""Jimi"" is matched only by the first thirty seconds of noise that opens ""Derber Papa"".
    Slowly, though, Beckett motivates what is <i>Player, Player</i>'s coarsest barrage of noise into a fast
    pulse over which he lies a sound that's uncannily similar to the sound of the human breath. It's a slow
    breath, and a pained one, but it persists, and for me, it's the paradigm of <i>Player, Player</i>'s
    humanity-within-machinery motif.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with ""Hey Brother"", which, with the exception of a faint electronic drumbeat, is entirely
    composed of Beckett singing along to acoustic guitar accompaniment. The quasi-folk song seems out of place
    on what is in many ways an academic electronic album, but de facto concludes a ring structure introduced by
    the sine tone of the first track: sound sandwiches meta-sound. On <i>Player, Player</i>, kpt.michi.gan  pulls
    us into our speaker cones and through our wires, shows us how beautifully sound is processed, and brings his
    tour to an end as our stereos, in a breathy Beckett voice, ask us with tongues in cheek: ""Hey brother, look
    at me.""</p></div>"|4525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4525-player-player/|8.1|Nicholas B. Sylvester

Advances in software and technique lead to new sounds and     structures, which are then absorbed quickly by an artists' community that takes light-speed dissemination of information as a given. And then, just as     quickly, the trends become tired. Or maybe it's the listeners growing weary. While ""keeping up"" with rock music has always been a matter of finding who     is writing the good songs, experimental electronic music is about a search for new feelings. Most of the time, when sliding a new CD into the tray,     we're looking for surprises. We're talking about hard work.</p><p>Most of the time. What I love about the Stephan Mathieu and Ekkehard Ehlers collaboration <em>Heroin</em> is that it reminds me that IDM records don't have to     sound new to sound great, and that a handful of these records, even though they're part of a zeitgeist tethered to fluctuations in CPU clock speeds,     have a certain timelessness. On the surface, this record-- recorded between December 27, 2000 and January 2, 2001 in the Netherlands performance space     Extrapool-- sounds very much like any one of many glitch-click-cut records released in the late 90s. All the familiar sounds are intact. And yet,     Mathieu &amp; Ehlers, during their week of recording, managed to tap into what made this trend so captivating in the first place. Noise and     unpredictability can both subvert and enrich traditionally musical sound, and when you get the balance right, as they do on <em>Heroin</em>, the whole far     outstrips the sum of its parts.</p><p><em>Heroin</em> was originally released in 2001 as a limited pressing on the small label Brombron. It was a seldom-heard blip until Kit Clayton rescued it from     oblivion by reissuing it on Orthlorng Musork, adding an additional disc of remixes to the package. Mathieu and Ehlers have worked together since,     collaborating on the second ""Plays John Cassavetes"" track on Ekkehard Ehlers' Plays collection. That stunning piece of music, which looped a section of     the Beatles' ""Good Night"", demonstrated that this pair likes to toy with achingly beautiful melodies. And indeed, <em>Heroin</em> is quite accessible despite     the loads of theory Ehlers and Mathieu bring to the table. In the early going, this record could even be described as sentimental. The opening ""New     Year's Eve"" mixes the sound of distant fireworks with a sad, wistful organ tune, and it's uncanny how much this music feels like a tiny black and white     film. Images explode into my head with the rockets whenever I hear it-- abandoned piers, distant crowds, hidden faces.</p>
<p>""New Year's Even"" fades into my favorite track here, ""Rose"", which consists of a short clip of keyboard music looped and reversed underneath a melodica     melody. It's another example of what I was talking about earlier, where Mathieu and Ehlers take a device that's been around forever (reversed drums     date at the very least from ""Are You Experienced?"") and make it fresh and moving. With its endlessly repeating backward keyboard pattern, ""Rose"" seems     like the output of some kind of self-contained music machine, spinning out a single breathtaking melodic fragment that you could listen to forever. Then     comes the heavily processed ""Turkey Song"", which takes ""Christmas Time is Here"" from Vince Guaraldi's <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> and warps the Peanuts     gang's voices until the song sounds like a broken memory struggling through the head of an Alzheimer's patient.</p>
<p>The rest of <em>Heroin</em> takes a darker, dronier turn that's less emotionally direct but remains strong throughout. I like to imagine that the clanging     keyboard that competes with the static in ""Supertramp"" is a half-speed sample of one of the notes from ""Goodbye Stranger"", but there's no way to     know for sure. The first track named ""Rausch"" combines warmth with randomness in a way that reminds me of Microstoria, while the second     ""Rausch"", which has thick curls of noise shifting slowly around a single held chord, almost sounds like Windy &amp; Carl. Tracks on <em>Heroin</em> flow one into     the next and all are at least very good.</p>
<p>The remix disc is spottier. Producers take extensive liberties with the source material and fashion something completely new, which is good, but they     also happen to stay on a more abstract path, lending a degree of unity. Still, the subtlety and creative use of space that makes the <em>Heroin</em> record     special is mostly absent from these reworkings. There's a good cast (Joseph Suchy, Nobukazu Takemura, Kit Clayton, Freiband, Christian Fennesz, Oren     Ambarchi, Carmen Baier &amp; Akira Rabelais), but ultimately they manage only two killer tracks. One is Fennesz' ""Codeine"", which already appears on his     excellent <em>Field Recordings 1995-2002</em> compilation. The other is Cologne legend Joseph Suchy's "":quque"", which brilliantly incorporates his     disorienting kaleidoscopic guitar technique. Beyond that, there's some interesting stuff, but nothing terribly special. As a bonus disc, the remix disc is just that,     but the original <em>Heroin</em> has the goods, one of the better records of its kind to emerge in the last five years.</p></div>"|5149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5149-heroin/|8.6|Mark Richardson

    Badly Drawn Boy, a less subtle Elliott Smith, a strained Rufus Wainwright, an overwhelmed M. Ward...but we don't settle for RIYL contextualizing 
    here at Pitchfork.</p><p>
    The confessional male singer/songwriter path is a well-tread trail, first battered down decades ago by some strikingly 
    capable feet, and these days maintained by a small handful of exceptional contemporaries.  It's a subgenre that gets reinvented occasionally 
    and rehashed incessantly, but even those with a strong tolerance for breathless singer/songwriter pontificating will find 
    Ed Harcourt's airy croon tiring, derivative, or at worst unnecessary after a few listens.  Like Harcourt's Mercury Prize-nominated full-
    length debut-- 2002's <i>Here Be Monsters</i>-- <i>From Every Sphere</i> isn't quite thick or dynamic 
    enough to withstand such a high level of exposure. With twelve fine-but-predictable songs (fourteen on the US edition) full of unremarkable, 
    yawning melodies, it's not especially difficult to chart the linear path of a Harcourt ballad after hearing only the first thirty seconds, which prompts 
    the inevitable question: why keep listening?  Even a bored game of finish-the-lyric poses little challenge here: ""We are joined at the hip like ""   ""Siamese 
    twins!""</p><p>
    To be fair, there is redemption embedded within, a few genuinely interesting bits wedged between stacks and stacks of 
    gooey piano ballads. ""From Every Sphere"" is excessively shimmery, but its dense drone and unrelenting piano are strangely convincing 
    partners; Harcourt ditches his high, lazy caw for some quiet, inaudible cooing, and the whole starlit mess eventually shifts into 
    something hypnotic and strangely compelling. ""Watching The Sun Come Up"" is a notable pop achievement, wherein Harcourt lets his vocals 
    play a bit Buckley, swinging wildly over a slathered-on skin of electric guitar and piano. ""Ghost Writer"" is the most self-
    consciously ""experimental"" (circa 1995?) track on the record, littered with beats, quick, abstract movements, and Harcourt's 
    deep, devious growl.  But the rest of <i>From Every Sphere</i> is straightforward cruising stuff; palatable, but without enough 
    twists and knots to keep anyone fully engaged.</p><p>
    Oddly enough, Harcourt harbors a certain amount of self-awareness about his comparably bland folk-popping and, subsequently, has been 
    making some wild, deliberate leaps away from his benign singer/songwriter pigeonhole.  Check this: at an Italian music 
    festival, Harcourt smashed his electric piano into two pieces! And for those not as impressed by gratuitously 
    splintering wood and spewing tangles of string, Harcourt has another trick in his poem-filled backpack: he plays a shitload of 
    instruments.  Piano, electric guitar, ""squeaky"" pump organ, drums, bass, clavinet, bells, percussion, harmonica, slide and acoustic 
    guitar, bass, glockenspiel, korg synths, omnichord, and something called a ""fun machine"" all earn Harcourt a paragraph of liner notes.  
    They're credits he deserves, as Harcourt's clearly a gifted musician, but his exhaustive I-can-play-it list is also a pretty telling 
    overcompensation.  Technical virtuoso has never equaled ""interesting.""</p></div>"|3740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3740-from-every-sphere/|5.8|Amanda Petrusich

In our world of effusive, odd similes,
    arcane accusations and contrarian revisionism, either extreme will do, yet to our chagrin, some musicians
    don't set out to make a quick million <i>or</i> push things forward. Some artists just take what other people
    do, and do it much better. Such, for instance, is the appeal of the New Pornographers, or Luna, or Aimee
    Mann.</p><p>
    
    And Earlimart. There's absolutely nothing on these Californians' third proper album (they released an EP earlier this year) that
    you haven't heard before on a hundred indie discs. Languid strum patterns, spooky pianos, shimmery  arpeggios,
    distant e-bows sawing away under half-whispered, heavy-lidded vocals-- it's all there. But it's better than you might think.</p><p>
    
    ""We're So Happy (We Left the Piano In the Truck)"" opens as a dreamy march, carried along by gentle
    snare rolls and male/female cooing of the title phrase; I imagine this is what Mirah would sound like
    if she were sprung free from Phil Elvrum's clutches. The evident single ""We Drink On the Job"" is a faster
    and goofier affair, co-produced by Jason Lytle of Grandaddy (this bit of patronage will probably pay off
    in publicity but it feels quite unnecessary; Aaron Espinoza, who masterminded the rest of the CD, is a
    terrific producer-- more on that later).</p><p>
    
    ""The Movies"" was the first song to leap out at me, demanding replay. It's stately and sad, beginning with a
    minor piano figure and featuring a slightly strangulated vocal. I'll risk a disservice to Earlimart by comparing it to
    the Smashing Pumpkins circa <i>Adore</i>-- which is not at all a criticism: j'adore <i>Adore</i>. ""Lost At Sea"" is a jarring segue,
    and rocks it like Sparklehorse-- twin funnels of guitar distortion and a barking Vocoder are yours for 1 minute 26 seconds.</p><p>
    
    The ill-placed ""Untitled"" is a bit of instrumental filler that makes you suspect Earlimart are straying, but thankfully that's not the case:
    the catchiest song on this album, ""Burning the Cow"", is right around the corner.  In case you're curious, the chorus actually does
    go ""Burning the cow, burning the cow"", not unlike the Judas Priest classic. With any luck, it will become the summer-barbeque
    sing-along of 2003.</p><p>
<i>Everyone Down Here</i> stops alternating tempos midway through, and achieves a certain sun-glazed
    Cali Zen. ""Hospital"" and ""Lazy Feet 23"" sway darkly in slo-mo, like seaweed underwater; by the time ""Night,
    Nite"" rolls around, you've been lulled into hypnotized contentment. At this point, Espinoza could be
    whispering assassination orders in your ear and you'd comply tomorrow morning. </p><p>
    
    The reason it all works?  Texture. Aaron Espinoza pays more attention to texture than just
    about anyone out there twiddling the proverbial knobs. I tend to fall for producers with signature tricks--
    Jon Brion's glockenspiels and harmonia, Dave Fridmann's unique way with drums, Albini's ability to
    press the ""rec"" button-- but Espinoza's greatness is subtler. Every instrument on ""Everyone Down Here""
    sounds warm, yet weird: hearing a simple tremolo on a guitar lick is, somehow, a revelation. Even the tape
    hiss that haunts the first and last several seconds of each song is somehow rendered pleasant, like a handful
    of sand oozing between your fingers. </p><p>
    
    Earlimart may not allay Grandaddy's Luddite worries, but they do score a small victory over technocrats
    by providing the best argument for analog studio recording I've heard in a long while. The bedroom
    is a fine place, and you can loop your uncle's hacking cough into a most excellent percussion bit, but can
    your sophtware do this?</p></div>"|2652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2652-everyone-down-here/|8.5|Michael Idov

<p>From: Shamra Tunsa<br/> Subject: Deftones Review</p>
<p>Pitchdorks,</p>
<p>Deftones sounds more like a band in the throws of a mid-life crisis than a group of musicians that could be called the 'Radiohead of Metal'. This is music on the fence-post of popular pining and dulled experimentation, an anachronistic addition to an otherwise respectable discography, and it will be remembered as such.</p>
<p>ARE YOU FUCKIN KIDDING ME!?!? Andrew Bryant should be drowned in a capsized port-a-potty for writing bullshit like this! How did he get hired, is he someone's cousin or fuckbuddy or something?</p>
<p><i>Deftones</i> is probably the greatest album to be released this entire fuckin year! Maybe its just that Andy couldn't hear how awesome ""When Girls Telephone Boys"" and ""Battle-Axe' are with his head stuck so far up his own ass. How can anyone say these kick-ass songs are anywhere near that pussy Linkin Park shit? Also, I'd like to call his bluff regarding the lyrics to ""Moana."" These are just the kind of 9th-grade poetic flubs found in the bottom-left hand corner of my old Earth Science primer.</p>
<p>If Andrew Bryant is so fuckin talented, how come the only songs he liked were the shitty ones? ""Lucky You"" and ""Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event""? Dude how many Cure albums does a guy have to swallow to fully appreciate the sappy filler on albums like this? Only little girls would pick the emo piano shit on a Metal album. Bryant shows his true elitist colors picking on the programmed drums in ""Lucky You"" instead of actually paying attention—he might notice how well the group interchanges the quiet-loud-quiet motif with moments of silence. I hope you fire him, he obviously has no idea what good music is.</p>

<p>From: Connor Kiley<br/> Subject: p4k, sold out?</p>
<p>Ryan,</p>
<p>Did Pitchfork strike a deal with Viacom or something? Why all the recent reviews of major label bands (Led Zeppelin, Metallica...ok I can see Liz Phair but the Deaf-tones)? I mean, ok, yeah, I liked The Cure in high school, these mallrat idiots suckered me with <i>Minerva</i> a few years back, but the rest of their catalog, or what I've heard of it, is crass commercial melodrama on par with Marilyn Manson. Even the tracks with hardcore roots—""Bloody Cape"" and ""Good Morning Beautiful,"" for example—reek of Moreno's guilty conscience. He's stuck playing to teenage goth metal fans while pretending he's all ""indie rock"" because he's heard MBV and The Smiths. Yeah dude, those records are wicked hard to come by!</p>
<p>Ok, ""Hexagram"" may distinguish them from Staind and Korn with all the chugging, but only in the eyes of future generations, 'cos any praise wasted on this shit is splitting already thin hairs— and I'd rather rip a few off that pie-face's double-chin-cloaking goatee. Atkins, dude, not facial hair. For every one of Deftones' highlights (wait, is there more than one?), there are twelve cartoonish attempts at reclaiming the old-days of a fuckin outright embarrassment to begin with: metal. Ever since Tool started with their drama club metal, TSR teens have been rolling twenty-sided dice and donning black leather overcoats like it's going out of style. NEWSFLASH: Skinny kids look even scrawnier in those things, and fat kids, dude, just roll with the roll-- what, you're magically gonna drop the tire in the unlikely event a girl gets past all five buckles on that cape?</p>
<p>Oh, but ""Needles and Pins,"" man, give me a break, is this fuckin Limp Bizkit? Listen to that fuckin' chorus and this record HAS to get a 0.0. ""Who wants to fuck with us now?"" I mean that's just fuckin' pure Iron Maiden nonsense, and you guys are actually debating this record's place in comparison to real artists like Single Frame (thanks for the tip) or even Radiohead. Oh, then that whimpering little ""serious song"", ""Deathblow."" What a fuckin title. <i>Deathblow</i>. Why not call it fucking ""Columbine"", dudes. Their attempt at ambient space and fuzzed out guitar would be laughable, but the irony of a line like ""It's still the same song/ It's still the same song"" only merits something equally retarded: I'm ROTFLMAO.</p>
<p>Pitchfork is above this, and I hope you just chuck this pandering major label coverage policy out the window with Brent D's hatemail.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/> Connor Kiley</p>
<p>PS: Are you hiring?</p>

    I must have grown bored speaking into the tiny recorder, since on later examination the inebriated voice on the tape fades into the distance, replaced by the ambient sound of a 
    television and the kitchen clatter of falling pans and boiling water.  My syrupy Southern-drawl had been triggered that evening by a cathartic binge-drinking episode brought about 
    by one of the relatively rare fights and subsequent separations I've had with my long-time girlfriend.  Emotionally daft and musically a dork, I knew the only way I was going to 
    win her back was not through mature discussion of our problem, but by making her the world's best mix-tape; the cherry on top of this expert selection of wistful love-and-Jessica 
    themed tracks turned into the above drunken plea for her to come back to me.  As much as I wince at my whiny, pathetic voice listening to the tape now-- having 
    recently re-discovered it at the bottom of a storage bin in our apartment-- I can only imagine how she must have interpreted my desperate entreaty those many years ago.</p><p>
    Scott Chernoff, the vocalist and reluctantly titled bandleader of Molasses, produces music in the same vein as my twilight analog-experiment-- complete with sleeve-worn emotions, 
    found sound collages, and off-key, often dubious lyrics-- except, unlike myself, he has the dual advantages of 1) a modicum of musical talent and 2) the backing of the same Montreal pool of 
    musicians that's spawned Godspeed You! Black Emperor and The Shalabi Effect.  Relying on minimally driven pseudo-folk tunes and quasi-gospels, Chernoff has created in <i>A Slow Messe</i> 
    a musical metaphor for the seeming paradox of starving in the land of plenty.</p><p>
    Which is to say he had plenty of help: his stable of seven regular musicians and a huge rotating cast of musical fixtures includes Thalia Zedek (Come, Empty House), Chris Brokaw 
    (Codeine, Come), Efrim Menuck (GY!BE, and more than likely that band you had in high school that only survived one practice-- yeah that one), Bruce Cawdron (GY!BE, Set Fire To Flames), David 
    Michael Curry (Willard Grant Conspiracy, Boxhead Ensemble), and J.S. Truchy (Fly Pan Am, Set Fire To Flames).  How one album can sport so many guest stars yet manage to hide nearly 
    all evidence of their contributions is a feat in itself, one Chernoff should probably be commended for after he makes proper amends for producing such a glut of uninspired tracks.</p><p>
    Not that quantity matters when discussing that which is unwanted-- after all, one bucket of shit would be just as undesirable to find at your doorstep as two-- but the fact 
    that this double album of twenty-six tracks, divided neatly between thirteen vocals and thirteen musical interludes, could leave one with the impression that it will never end is a valid criticism 
    against the venture.  Don't get me wrong: I wouldn't disregard ""Delirium Rag"" off-hand just because it's twelve minutes of my life that I'll never get back-- thirty-six if you consider that 
    I listen to every album I review a minimum of three times-- but it's obvious that the ragged formula of these musical collectives is wearing thin.  It's no longer amusing or 
    musically clever to follow five minutes of train-station sounds with a husky ballad containing high-pitched lines such as ""We'll all go to heaven through the hole in the floor.""  And it's one 
    of their best compositions.</p><p>
    The remainder of <i>Slow Messe</i> shuttles back and forth between pretentious snippets of musical money-shots-- the drugged piano of ""Hopeless"", John Cale's European son ""Dans Une 
    Maison Croulante"", and the postponed-bass of ""Reprieve, 15 Julliet""-- and Harry Smith-inspired white-man's blues digging on tracks like ""Silkworm"" and the appropriately titled electric 
    guitar workout, ""White Blues"".  Pardoning moments are few and far between, but among them, the high-end screeching of ""Death March (Erskine's Theme)"" does perks one's ears, and 
    the closing track ""Slow Mass"" is pretty enough, with its church-organ dirge and lovely room tone.  But these tired, typical modes can't make an album reputably ""mysterious"" anymore, and 
    Molasses are guaranteed to suffer the same fate as that of my own Dionysian, shameful plea for love: another ten years of waiting in an abandoned box until somebody 
    gets the masochistic urge to dig it out and hang their head in embarrassment.</p></div>"|5380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5380-a-slow-messe/|2.7|Andrew Bryant

    On her 1993 debut, <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, Phair's gruff voice wrapped awkward non-hooks around flimsy,
    transparent chord progressions, resulting in (to everyone's surprise) a certifiable indie roadtrip classic.
    It still stands as a powerfully confrontational album, skirting convention yet marked by Phair's striking
    awareness of her own limitations.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, it seems that Phair has spent the better part of her post-<i>Exile</i> career trying to
    gloss over the very limitations that made her original statement so profound.  Though her second album,
    <i>Whip-Smart</i>, had a few choice moments which recalled the insight and complexity of <i>Exile</i>,
    it ultimately seemed like a much more calculated affair.  Things didn't start to go <i>horribly</i> awry,
    of course, until Phair's next album, <i>Whitechocolatespaceegg</i>.  That record's attempts to radio-ize
    her sound only dismantled the depth of her music-- if not the awkwardness-- resulting in an odd batch of
    songs that perhaps encapsulated Phair's faulty view of what constitutes a radio-friendly album.</p><p>
    Ten years on from <i>Exile</i>, Liz has finally managed to achieve what seems to have been her goal ever
    since the possibility of commercial success first presented itself to her: to release an album that could
    have just as easily been made by anybody else.  Even the songs on <i>Liz Phair</i> that could be considered
    ""shocking"" or ""profound"" are gratuitous and overdetermined, eschewing the stark and accusatory insights of
    <i>Exile</i> in favor of pointless f-bombs, manipulative ballads, and foul-mouthed shmeminism.</p><p>
    Liz Phair has always been known for her vulgarity, but on <i>Exile</i> and parts of <i>Whip-Smart</i>, she
    put that trait to good use.  On ""Fuck and Run"", a standout from <i>Exile</i>, Phair used the word's negative
    connotations as a means of pointed self-deprecation and lamented, ""Whatever happened to a boyfriend/ The
    kind of guy who makes love cause he's in it/ I want a boyfriend/ I want all that stupid old shit/ Letters
    and sodas.""  ""Flower"", Phair's most notorious track to date, reads like a laundry list of graphic sexual
    desires, but rather than paint a uniformly flattering portrait of her love interest, he's immature, he's
    obnoxious, and despite it all, she still wants to fuck his brains out-- a simple, necessarily crude
    semi-contradiction that speaks volumes.</p><p>
    ""Flower"" would seem to have a descendent in ""H.W.C."" (""Hot White Cum""), in which Phair extols the virtue of
    semen as a beauty aid (""...Dear <i>Cosmo</i>: Splooge, The New Rouge!"").  But, unlike the complex,
    alternatingly cocky and self-effacing sexuality of ""Flower,"" ""H.W.C.""'s unqualified sperm-praise is
    entirely vain and degrading.  Even more degrading is the constipated donkeyfuck harmonica solo towards
    the track's end, a hilarious sideshow that only magnifies the triteness of the song's glycerin-slick
    production.</p><p>
    Though ""H.W.C."" is without question the best water-cooler conversation piece on <i>Liz Phair</i>, ""Rock Me""
    makes for a close second.  Here, Phair sings exuberantly about the benefits of an affair with a younger guy
    including-- I shit you not-- ""[playing] Xbox on [his] floor.""  In between choruses of, ""Baby baby baby if
    it's alright/ Want you to rock me all night,"" Phair declares, ""I'm starting to think that young guys rule!""
    without a trace of self-doubt or reflection.  It's hard to imagine that the Liz Phair of ten years ago
    wouldn't have had something profound and devastating to say about older women who shack up with clueless
    college kids, but on ""Rock Me""-- as on the rest of <i>Liz Phair</i>-- vapid, cliché-filled rhyme couplets
    dominate.</p><p>
    Take, for example, the album's first single, ""Why Can't I"", ""co""-written by Avril Lavigne songwriting team
    The Matrix.  With a chorus of, ""Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?"" and a cookie-cutter
    rock/pop background, the song could easily pass for Michelle Branch.  The lyric, ""We haven't fucked yet/
    But my head's still spinning,"" seemingly seeks to set Phair apart from the teen-pop crowd, but the use of
    the word is completely gratuitous-- change it to ""kissed"" and stick a 16-year-old girl in front of the mic
    and no one could tell the difference.</p><p>
    Only on ""Little Digger"" does Phair attempt to tackle subject matter unique to the circumstances of her own
    life as a 36-year-old single mother.  The song has received positive press for addressing a difficult issue,
    as Phair sings to her son about his absent father and the new men she's dating.  But the fact that anything
    positive could be said about this track speaks only to the overwhelming lack of substance on this record.
    From its cloying synthstring arrangements to its ballad-in-a-box drumbeat to its infuriatingly manipulative
    chorus of, ""My mother is mine,"" ""Little Digger"" offers up all the insight and emotion of a UPN sitcom.</p><p>
    In recent interviews, Phair has been upfront about her hopes of mainstream success, and claims full awareness
    that <i>Liz Phair</i> is likely to alienate many of her original fans.  What she doesn't seem to realize is
    that a collection of utterly generic rocked-out pop songs isn't likely to win her many new ones.  It's sad
    that an artist as groundbreaking as Phair would be reduced to cheap publicity stunts and hyper-commercialized
    teen-pop.  But then, this is ""the album she has always wanted to make""-- one in which all of her quirks and
    limitations are absorbed into well-tested clichés, and ultimately, one that may as well not even exist.</p></div>"|6255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6255-liz-phair/|0.0|Matt LeMay

    burger at Manhattan's Old Homestead steakhouse. Every ingredient is classed up: you get Kobe beef, arugula
    instead of lowly lettuce-- they even work truffles into the equation, somehow. But in the end it's still a burger,
    dominated by the fundamentally proletarian pairing of meat and bread. It's not even a very good burger, and
    neither should it be: you pay to taste the money you just spent.</p><p>
    
    Echoboy takes just about every British musical invention of the last two decades and reduces it to an indication of good taste.
    Over the course of the album, direct quotes from myriad Great Sources float in and out of the speakers,
    ushered by the infamous Flood (the producer who made Depeche Mode sound like U2 and the Smashing Pumpkins
    sound like Depeche Mode). But hiding below layers of dated synth noise, dinky drum machines and expensive
    effects is, surprise surprise, a solo bedroom recording. 50 minutes of structured wankery, as
    performed by a lone Brit with the questionable talent to put a chorus to a verse, employing a thin, laddish vocal and
    rudimentary guitar skills.</p><p>
    
    ""Automatic Eyes"" is the ultimate all-things-to-all-people single, owing its
    prolonged-orgasm dynamic to New Order, its bass melody to Blur and its vocal line to just about anyone willing
    to claim it.  Thankfully, some songs on <i>Giraffe</i>-- notably ""Don't Destroy Me"" and ""Summer Rhythm""-- aren't quite as
    naked in their crossover ambitions; in fact, most tend to start out fine in their minimalism, but they gradually head for
    the toilet as Flood's stratagems take over.  Track after track, Echoboy's ideas are reshaped to approximate preexisting
    sounds: ""Wasted Spaces"" is U2's ""Discotheque"" sideways, and ""Fun in You"" sounds like Depeche Mode (before
    the song even comes on, really).</p><p>
    
    I'll grant that some of these tunes put up more of a fight: ""Comfort of the Hum"" is the closest Echoboy
    comes to a convincing patchwork quilt, a singalong about the joys of city living; it's a piano-based piece
    prone to hanging on the 5th chord, before triumphantly resolving into the 1st. ""Good on TV""
    initially dares to present the 'Boy's voice stripped of effects, at least until the punkish chorus: ""All that
    we can do is sit and wait/ For the money to accumulate/ But it's never gonna happen to me/ Cause
    I don't look good on TV.""  Forget TV, Echoboy-- worry about how you sound on record.</p><p>
    
    Only on <i>Giraffe</i>'s closing song ""Nearly All the Time"" does Echoboy allot himself any conceptual
    breathing room. After the ""official"" portion of the song ends, careening strings and Mellotron extend the
    track in the direction of Madchester psychedelia. But almost predictably, it ends at the precise moment it
    gets interesting, further evidence of how the 'Boy and Flood can't figure good from bad, relying on outside standards
    to dictate how far they should take anything.</p><p>
    
    Several critics, in the UK and here, found Echoboy's chaotic borrowings nothing less than
    revolutionary-- the mere application of electronic vocabulary to conventional song structure, for
    instance, struck my colleague at PopMatters as fresh. Personally, I find another reaction
    more telling: in the ultimate backhanded compliment, another thieving magpie-- Noel Gallagher--
    reportedly offered Echoboy a job with Oasis.</p></div>"|2679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2679-giraffe/|4.7|Michael Idov

    label moves, and erratic reissues that barely keep their catalog in print.  Along the way they've grown from their self-titled debut-- a hardcore
    record full of unreflective howls from upset youngsters-- to a band that's impossible to categorize beyond the all-purpose term ""avant rock.""</p><p>
    
    Based out of ""America's First Portland"" (Maine), Cerberus Shoal reflect some of the crunchier elements of their hometown-- their shambolic instrumentals can
    evoke the sound of an ancient, tribal dope-smoking ritual-- but they're far from a hippie band: even their jams avoid the aimless plod of stoner rock, and
    duck the smug academic fervor that taints so much experimental music.  Probably the most important quality to their music, going all the way back to that first
    hardcore record, is simply that they're patient: they'll give an idea the time it needs to unfold, and whatever their destination, they'll just get there when they get there.</p><p>
    
    Their second and possibly their best record <i>...and Farewell to Hightide</i>-- newly reissued on Temporary Residence-- has a resonance that pulls its songs into an engrossing
    suite.  The five tracks move with the force and breadth; they're captivating right from the start of ""Falling to Pieces Part One"", where a shimmering organ embeds Chriss (sic)
    Sutherland's voice, moaning and tuneful, while lightly-seared noises swoop in like bony crows.  The song crackles with anticipation, which bursts when they cut to ""Broken
    Springs Spring Forth From Broken Clocks""-- an explosively loose jam that's well-paced but as ferocious as its title.</p><p>
    
    More than half the pieces feature Sutherland's vocals, but he doesn't corral the music into rigid structure as much as add another layer to the stretched-out textures.  Half
    the time he's just speaking, delivering a kind of obsessive monologue-- especially on the record's centerpiece, ""J.B.O. vs. Blin"", where he nails the sound of endless late-night
    self-recrimination.  He harps on the word ""failure"" while Jeremy Federman's echoey trumpet circles him, hashing outs his thoughts in a glowing twelve-minute dirge.</p><p>
    
    Though the shortest piece on <i>Farewell... runs 6-plus minutes, only ""Make Winter a Driving Song"" feels too long-- and then only because it sounds so contented.  The rest
    of the album rocks gently between tension and resolution, until it closes on an unexpectedly lovely finish: in ""Falling to Pieces Part Two"", Sutherland's musings come
    to a kind of peace against a backdrop of flute, violin and piano.  If this album resembles late-night insomnia, this is the point where-- whether or not he's solved the world's
    problems-- Sutherland finally drifts off.</i></p><p>
    
    This reissue comes with bonus material that's cordoned off to a second disc: the songs ""Lighthouse in Athens"" parts one and two, which include beautiful fragments of gray,
    yearning post-rock.  The songs show that Sutherland-- while heartfelt and often captivating-- lacks the range or force to be a full-time lead vocalist, even in the
    idiosyncratic vein of a Sam Prekop.  The tunes aren't as fleshed-out or visionary as the proper album, though they're enjoyable enough B-sides from the road not taken.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to Cerberus Shoal's third album, also just reissued by Temporary Residence: <i>Elements of Structure/Permanence</i>, their first all-instrumental disc.  A local artist named
    Tim Fallon had asked them to record soundtracks for two half-hour silent films; the band used this as a chance to work with musicians from two other Maine groups,
    Tarpigh and Interstellar Policeman.  The final pick-up band included nine people, who performed the pieces as group improvisations, finishing them both in a couple of takes.</p><p>
    
    Right away, it's amazing how well this group coheres: the rhythm section locks together, as Sutherland uses slow, heavy bass lines while drummer Tom Rogers and percussionist
    Eric LaPerna goad the rest of the band to life.  Tom Kovasevic's charango, and Tim Harbeson's accordion and trumpet thread color into the slow, dense pieces: even without
    a composition to guide them, the band expertly swells and contracts.  This is a collective that knows how to work a crescendo.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the musicians hang together <i>so</i> well that they end up playing it safe.  Nobody takes a risk after the first ten or so seconds, and the two pieces come out
    sounding almost exactly alike.  The soloists are passive-- noone wanders far from the path marked out by the rhythm section-- and the band never leaves a somber, mid-tempo
    pace.  Even after the second track slides into a faintly audible percussion interlude, it just comes back to pick up right where it left off.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>Elements</i> is memorable as the point where Cerberus Shoal turned away from ""songwriting."" Tarpigh merged with the band, bringing their Middle Eastern influence; while
    they continue to change directions-- and line-ups-- Cerberus Shoal's later work is full of clanking, exotic percussion, jagged guitars and instrumentals that can dart by like shards or
    stretch out like caravans.  Few of their works are as long-winded as <i>Elements of Structure/Permanence</i>, but like <i>...and Farewell to Hightide</i>, it proves they can give their ideas

Over the past couple of years, indie's courtship of the dancefloor has gotten so much
    coverage, I'd almost forgotten there was once a time when post-hardcore looked like the most interesting subtext on the underground horizon.
    Looking back, I guess there was a spectrum of activity along those lines, with, say, Fugazi on one end, and Neurosis on the other, their endgames
    resulting in almost-but-not-quite ""alt-rock"" and almost-but-not-quite ""ambient"", respectively.  There were also a few hundred bands in between
    that could be shoved like round pegs into whatever square hole critics needed to use to prove their point.  My point?  If there's a common thread among bands
    that once played hardcore and went on to do other things, maybe it's that despite whatever changes, they rarely end up in a commercial spot.</p><p>
    
    I'm not complaining, mind you.  This year, when <i>Wonderful Rainbow</i> finishes in the top 20 of the Pazz &amp; Jop poll, I will be among the first to offer my
    congrats to the Providence band.  It takes some doing to turn out a record containing a brick wall of metallic oppression and still have folks
    clamoring for more.  Still, I'd be surprised if Lightning Bolt's sound (or that of any Load act) translated into any kind of mainstream popularity.
    Even in the glory days of early 90s radio rock, when you might hear Helmet, Pantera and Nirvana in a row, aggression only mattered if the hooks backed
    up the noise.  Ten years later, the hard have become harder-- but arguably even further removed from breaking through to the other side.  Truthfully, I
    might not even bring it up were it not for records like <i>Take Your Skin Off</i>, because I'm sure mass popularity is the last thing on these bands' minds.
    However, if Lightning Bolt represents the anthemic and inclusive, Mindflayer is a small but potent ""fuck off.""</p><p>
    
    Formed in 1996, and hailing from the same Providence, Rhode Island scene that produced Lightning Bolt, Arab on Radar and Black Dice, Mindflayer
    understand the benefits of raw power.  The duo-- jack-of-all-electronics Matt Brinkman (Forcefield) and drummer/vocalist
    Brian Chippendale (Lightning Bolt)-- play a jagged mixture of No Wave-informed torture rock, hard beats, with an almost psychedelic command of
    disorientating squeals, squelches and microphone feedback.  Their sound is related to LB, though without a bass, there is an obvious emphasis on
    crackly, grating textures.  Prior to <i>Take Your Skin Off</i>, the band had released a few CD-Rs, decidedly unpolished but rarely lacking in intensity.
    On their first proper recording, they make no bones about tearing shit up, and if you can handle a little drug-induced strangeness alongside the tried
    and true Providence power, it's a fun ride.</p><p>
    
    The coolest stuff happens when they opt for variation over oppression: ""Gold Lake Spiller"" starts on a percussive pounce, but quickly dissolves into what
    sounds like the death of a saxophone.  Chippendale hammers out a pulse on the toms, and the massive electro-drone emitted from Brinkman's machinery
    transforms what might have been aimless skronk into the soundtrack of the inner workings of a jet engine.  Likewise, the epic ""You're Dead at the
    Bottom of a Dungeon"" (possible reference to their namesake's RPG origins?) begins with the ornery hum of a generator of some kind, and random
    interjections from Chippendale over his trademark contact mic.  This intro does little to prepare me for the violent, messy onslaught of raging drums
    and the sound of synthesizers being used to bludgeon via cyclical whipping noises.  Then, the real hell breaks lose, as the beat is tightened, but
    only in service of two or three laser beam cannons and a gigantic BZZZZZZZZZ.  Ah yes, and then it gets interesting: Chippendale gets fed up
    with the grade school shit, and drops a mad multi-meter thing over which Brinkman decides his buzz-saw computer could do some pretty good damage.
    When the groove becomes apocalyptic disco, the squeaky space cannons go off, and we have a symphony of noises Robert Moog never intended his creations to
    make.</p><p>
    
    Unsurprisingly, large stretches of the record are going to sound pretty familiar to anyone paying attention to the Load, Bulb and like-minded
    rosters.  ""Take Your Shoes Off"" takes its hip-hop meets Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"" beat and wrings a little chaos out of it via moaning synth-bass and more
    offhanded sermonizing from Chippendale.  It leads directly into ""Head of State on A Plate"", with its persistent tribal tom-tom pattern,
    omnipresent, distorted high-pitched ringing and bass hits.  Like much of <i>Take Your Skin Off</i>'s first half, these tunes are good examples of a sound
    that rocks OK, but might not necessarily call anyone to arms.  Oddly enough, there does seem to be a sort of political mini-concept at work here too, to
    which  ""Head of State on A Plate"", ""Drop Bass Not Bombs"", ""Wind War III"" and ""Everyone Dies (We Won Anyway)"" might attest.</p><p>
    
    For the greater part of an hour, the band maintains a high energy level, though when the basic elements of your sound involve howling factory
    distortion, things can tend to get a tad monolithic.  Fans of any band connected to Mindflayer will have much to rejoice over here, and if by some
    chance you haven't yet been introduced to the Providence sound, you could do much worse.  Nevertheless, as totally uncompromising, hardcore noise rock
    goes, I'm sometimes left a little cold.  It's one thing to bust up a party with raw power, but people only stick around for the straight jams.</p></div>"|5543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5543-take-your-skin-off/|7.0|Dominique Leone

    from the skies; frogs arrive with small armies of lice and flies and locusts; and just when shit seems
    impossibly fucked, you have to fend off that nagging death plague by splashing lamb's blood on your stoop.
    That notorious run of bad luck already went down once, way back in the day, but in Spring 2003, The Locust
    are kicking it Moses-style once again, prophetically offering an aural equal for Jehovah's Old Testament
    punk-slap.</p><p>
    
    Those witnessing this cataclysm for first time might like to know that The Locust, a once-five-now-four-piece
    have been kicking around SoCal since 1995, and though this is only their second full-length, they've managed
    to keep busy with related projects: everyone but keyboardist Joey Karam plays in the dentally inclined Holy
    Molar, bassist Justin Pearson's in Some Girls, and drummer Gabe Serbian's was, until recently, a member of
    both the meaty, super-speedy death metal band Cattle Decapitation and Alec Empire's backing band.  And then
    there are the members' humble beginnings in seminal hardcore (or just plain hard) bands like Swing Kids,
    Struggle, Crimson Curse, etc.</p><p>
    
    Over the past eight years, The Locust have opted for spatial concision and elaborate packaging for their
    releases, and though things go out of print all the time, there are (and were) splits of many sizes with
    Man Is the Bastard, Melt-Banana, and Arab on Radar; a self-titled seven-inch and another self-titled
    twelve-inch; a five-inch picture disc split with Jenny Piccolo; a double twelve-inch with remixes of
    ""Well I'll Be a Monkey's Uncle"" by Kid606, I Am Spoonbender, Christoph de Babalon, and others; a reissue
    of 2001's <i>Flight of the Wounded Locust</i> EP on four seven-inches that fit together like a puzzle;
    and finally, this brand-new 21-track CD clocking in at under 21 minutes.  And though they sport tight
    bug suits, rest assured: this music is no joke.</p><p>
    
    Similar in a sense to the now-defunct American spazcore band Behead the Prophet No Lord Shall Live (who,
    incidentally, took their name from Deicide's <i>Legion</i>), The Locust locate themselves within a downpour
    of musical over-determination, attention-deficit-disorder time restraints, and a nod-nod, ha-ha
    twenty-something sexual irony sealed in a rapid-fire hardcore assault.  And in a serious case of coincidence,
    Behead the Prophet's vocalist took the stage name Joshua Plague some years ago while fronting The Mukilteo
    Fairies. Ah, Plague! Listening to The Locust's Anti Records debut, I was thinking how nice it'd be if these
    23 songs weren't referencing the good book at all, and were instead a tribute to the great, under-appreciated
    screamer behind two rad bands, and his smart-ass gay politics and hilarious <i>And Now I...</i> zine series.
    Alas, independent rock tosses aside history constantly.  As much as I want to hold out for beautiful in-scene
    props, I imagine the nod wasn't intended.</p><p>
    
    Whatever the theme, <i>Plague Soundscapes</i> is among the band's fiercest work yet, and stands as their
    most sinisterly melodic to date.  Clearly attuned to their genre's precedents, the band produces long song
    titles for tiny bursts of noise: ""Halo of Pubic Hair and Earwax Manufactured for the Champion in All of Us""
    is 58 seconds, and ""Late for a Double Date with a Pile of Atoms in the Water Closet"" but 45. When the band
    does lock into an epic jam like the minute-plus ""Twenty-Three Lubed Up Schizophrenics with Delusions of
    Grandeur"", they make certain the sounds remain spastically off-kilter within various densities and layers
    of drones and lasers and accelerated mosh parts.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Anything Jesus Does, I Can Do Better"" clocks in at 1:29, spitting up code amid crunchy
    headsmashing and ends with a blissful <i>Yars' Revenge</i> raga.  Showing a bit of noisy growth, the
    robots-do-battle instrumental ""Can We Please Get Another Nail in the Coffin of Culture Theft?"" is Pork
    Queen/Trackshun pretty.  Throughout <i>Plague Soundscapes</i> there's lots of high-end scratching, romping
    double-bassdrum (the opening of ""Solar Panel Ass"" is as heavy as Slayer), faux-explosions, more than a
    dozen non-standard noisemakers, claustrophobic keyboard blasts of bodily fluids and dislodged earwax, and
    vocalist/bassist Justin Pearson's incessant snarl-- all expansive while remaining aesthetically lodged
    within the confines of hardcore.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, The Locust aren't singularly reinventing music, but it could be said that <i>Plague Soundscapes</i>
    is, along with a handful of similarly minded bands, redefining hardcore, and with a modicum of pretentiousness.
    Sure, the shit's a bit inaccessible-- the guys are just bashing this stuff out-- but there's never a shred
    of elitism.  Christ, it's four dudes with no faces squeezing into tight pants and feigning murder on the
    dancefloor.  And you hear it in every note they play: The Locust simply love what they do.  With <i>Plague
    Soundscapes</i>, The Locust shot for broken bones and wound up epitomizing ""breakneck.""  Have you been
    injured in an accident?</p></div>"|4822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4822-plague-soundscapes/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

Upstanding news source that     Pitchfork is, I don't want to clog up this space with hearsay, conjecture, rumors, and gossip.  But let's     consider the evidence for a moment, shall we?  Ever since bassist Justin Harwood was traded for Phillips     and a record deal to be named later, Luna has been on a late-career roll: <i>Romantica</i> and its little     brother <i>Close Cover Before Striking</i> contained some of their finest work in years.  Coincidentally, much of     the Wareham compositions on these albums were as full of gooey feelings as a Homecoming dance.  And after     all, Phillips was the voice of Jem-- didn't we all have a little thing for Jem?</p>
<p>Whatever the wink-winks and nudge-nudges of their professional relationship, Wareham and Phillips sound     awfully close getting their collab on with <i>L'Avventura</i>.  In the valentine vein of <i>Romantica</i>'s     ""Mermaid Eyes"", many of the tracks appear in intimate duet form-- less ""Don't You Want Me?"" than ""I Fucking     <i>Want</i> You; Get That Fine Ass Over Here"".  And while the majority of the material covers artists     ranging from Madonna to The Doors, they're all run through the Dean-inator: heavy on the wooze and coy,     and dolloped with Fridmorchestration like Luna's last two efforts (actually provided here by VH1 trivia     answer Tony Visconti).</p>
<p>It's this string section velvet that kicks off <i>L'Avventura</i>, a grandiose atmosphere Wareham     immediately undercuts by rhyming ""eye"" with...""eye.""  It's this self-effacing panache, with Wareham fully     comfortable in his more amicable Lou Reed voice, that makes the album's mushiness palatable-- his sardonic     delivery turns a sex-change version of Madonna's ""I Deserve It"" into something less self-congratulatory and transmutes     Buffy St. Marie's anti-NASA protest song ""Moonshot"" into a fractured fairy-tale.</p>
<p>Britta coos fine curtains over Wareham's lower register on ""Hear the     Wind Blow"", and trades Mary Tyler Moore references on ""Ginger Snaps"", a lightly danceable counterpart to The     Postal Service for the demographic that hasn't yet embraced the laptop as musical instrument.  Her own     minutes in the spotlight, the self-penned ""Out Walking"" and ""Your Baby"", are somewhat less engaging, with     Phillips taking on a torch-singer role a bit too familiar next to Wareham's Grandpa Hipster persona.     ""Knives From Bavaria"", a Him song for Her vocals pays off better, with bedroom vocals and flitting drum     programming.</p>
<p>Like all Luna family projects, <i>L'Avventura</i> has a sneaky way of getting its claws into you-- background     music that gets stuck in your forebrain.  But also like most Luna product, this little vacation from the     less-talked about half of the band starts to bend under its own uniformity of mood somewhere in the     second half, and probably would've been slightly better acclimated to EP length.  The Silver Jews     cover ""Random Rules"" is a perfect fit for Wareham's style, but maybe loses half a point for being a bit     <i>too</i> easy (and similar to the original); the obscure ""Threw It Away"" and The Doors' ""Indian Summer""     both sound slight, with little input from Phillips.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the stronger material on <i>L'Avventura</i> is largely front-loaded, so you can go ahead and doodle     on the outer margins of your disc with no great loss.  Even with the excess, the album hits the perfect tone     for that summer romance you've been planning, or conversely, for inducing ulcer pains and crying     fits in the recently dumped.  So while it's usually more rewarding to hear a couple going all Stevie &amp;     Lindsay through their music, Dean &amp; Britta's Sonny &amp; Cher act is hardly a vanity project between two rock     stars that are maybe/maybe-not deep in lurve.</p></div>"|8584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8584-lavventura/|7.6|Rob Mitchum

    eternally-jean jacketed, pinching Mick Jagger's ass in Rolling Stone, now-awkwardly ubiquitous Ryan Adams-- but it seems unlikely 
    (red handed, here) that she'll ever get it.  <i>I'm Staying Out</i>, Cary's prompt follow-up to her 2002 debut <i>While You 
    Weren't Looking</i>, is full of earnest, hipster-bucking countrified pop, thick with violins, keyboards and soft, plaintively 
    breathed lyrics about obstinate women, girlish pining, and Sunday mornings spent curled tightly in bed.  Adams' musical influence on 
    <i>I'm Staying Out</i> is dismissible at best, but his smirking, messy-haired ghost seems destined to forever haunt Caitlin Cary's 
    Carolina halls, grinning toothily, bobbing his head, and snottily-- if unintentionally-- distracting everybody from what's really going 
    on.</p><p>
    
    At least stylistically, Cary's landed a fair distance away from the guy she now coyly (albeit affectionately) describes as ""some kid I 
    used to be in a band with.""  Whereas Adams has layered his post-Heartbreaker solo work with loads of dumb rock star swagger and 
    some stupidly intentional Parsons-esque photographs of flags and pistols (and dark-haired models in bed? Cigarettes? Headphones?), 
    Cary's is far less concerned with punk posturing, corporate sponsorship, or attracting the fickle affections of Winona Ryder.  
    This is sweet, safely melancholic, pretty-but-benign stuff; perfectly competent, <i>I'm Staying Out</i> compensates for its lack of 
    spectacular innovation by showcasing its players' technical prowess and busting out a handful of intensely sincere performances.</p><p>
    
    Cary's pitch-perfect alto seems alt-country certified: part-Natalie Merchant, part-Lucinda Williams, and occasionally-- see ""Please 
    Break My Heart""-- skewing a bit Patsy Cline.  Cary's is a consistently rich and effortless croon, pushing through 
    straightforward mid-tempo pop songs full of sub-fiddle flights for guitar solos, threaded-in keyboards and the occasional mandolin or 
    clavinet with impressive, comforting ease.</p><p>
    
    With her indisputable violin chops, Cary had already brazenly bowed her way through Whiskeytown's two-deep discography, breaking up 
    Adams' guitar pummeling with her subtle, satisfying coos.  Here, with Jayhawk Jen Gunderman lending a solid foundation of organ, 
    piano, and backing vocals, Cary's fiddling shines. ""Cello Girl"" mixes lite-rock electric guitar stroking with violin lines and 
    steady percussion; the excellent ""Sleepin' In On Sunday"" is a gentle and soothing lullaby, restrained percussion and lilting, 
    lazy vocals making its name feel awfully (if predictably) apt.  Title track ""I'm Staying Out"" is riddled with sad-eyed, syrupy 
    country twang and the obligatory lost-love lyricisms (""I know you are waiting for me to come home/ I hate to think of you spending 
    this night all alone/ But I'm not coming back, dear/ Not never or now,"") while the equally downtrodden ""In A While"" cleanly 
    incorporates the wails of dobro, trumpet, and baritone/tenor sax. </p><p>
    
    Periodically Cary's songwriting evokes the semi-confessional, intermittently caustic women songsmiths of the mid-to-late 1970s 
    (Carly Simon, Carole King, Stevie Nicks), weaving strong vocal melodies with pleasant instrumentation, and working, for the most 
    part, within traditional verse-chorus-verse song structures.  Cary occasionally hops out of 4/4, but she's not really kicking down any 
    new sonic paths.  It's all very fine and good, it's just not especially compelling.</p><p>
     
    No matter how different Cary and Adams' post-Whiskeytown outputs have been, neither has quite approached the tired, subdued beauty 
    of alt-country landmark <i>Pneumonia</i>.  So thank you, dismantled Whiskeytown, for stocking our shelves with plenty of perfectly 
    capable, occasionally tiresome, bandless alt-country singer/songwriters.  Now get on with that reunion, please.</p></div>"|1321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1321-im-staying-out/|7.0|Amanda Petrusich

    producer to lay down a great track that happens to feature Brandy.  I wouldn't exactly say this ethos has crept into indie rock, but the importance of production is 
    no smaller in the musical minor leagues.  Some records work best if they sound like they were recorded in a tin can, but others need the finesse of a skilled recordist to get 
    everything just right.</p><p>
    
    And Mayday are a band that's better served by finesse than tin cans.  Accurately described as a front for the muse of former Lullaby for the Working Class honcho/current 
    Cursive guitar hero Ted Stevens, Mayday released a frankly brilliant debut last year: <i>Old Blood</i>, an expansive, ambitious swirl of 
    Great Plains dust and sonic sophistication that blew expectations out of the water.  Part of the record's success was the deft hand lent to the recording by brothers Mike &amp; A.J. Mogis, 
    who together are about as close as you can get to Nigel Godrich in the breadbasket.</p><p>
    
    The brothers Mogis are unfortunately nowhere to be found on this new Mayday record, their first away from their old home at Saddle Creek records.  The band's music is good 
    enough to get them by without a proper treatment at the board, but it's hard to avoid imagining what a better recording could have done to make this album more dramatic and 
    intense.  As it stands, the recording is adequate to convey the band's ideas, but it frequently robs the arrangements of their distinctness by mashing the sounds together in the 
    same frequency range and letting distortion gain too much of an upper hand.</p><p>
    
    Despite a huge cast of players, <i>I Know Your Troubles Been Long</i> is a great deal more basic than its predecessor, a snapshot of rustbelt Americana suffused with impressionistic 
    lyrics that occasionally veer into the political realm, though never in a pointed manner.  ""Little Tremors"" takes an oblique look at the Iraq war with its imagery of a ""lonely cowboy"" and 
    the verse ""There are tremors in the valley/ Little tremors/ Can't you feel them.""  ""Virginia"" expands on this a bit, with its loosely woven tale of young lovers fleeing a town that turned on 
    them ""in support of a warring regime.""</p><p>
    
    Tentative commentary aside, Stevens trades in haunting verses like this doozy that opens ""Crawfish River"": ""Let's go down to the riverbed/ Let's go and catch some crawfish/ Mom will 
    throw them in the kettle, break their little backs first/ Our little Townes will bite off the heads one by one/ And laughing, he'll spit out each skull piece.""  The way Stevens takes nostalgic 
    memories like this and turns them into something sinister colors the whole album, and in a sense, the murk of the sound somewhat aids his sailboat-in-a-hurricane worldview.</p><p>
    
    Stevens is just about buried under the stuttering drums and ruddy guitars of ""Running Away"", but the song's arrangement builds up an incredible momentum before finally breaking 
    into a sort of tractor-pull hoedown, mud flying right along with the fiddles and slide guitars.  ""Lost Serenade"", on the other hand, is a masterful ballad, graced by lazily interwoven trumpet 
    and violin-- this is music for an empty prairie cabaret at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday.  The album is bookended by the beautiful garbage of ""Lone Star"" and ""Laundromat"", songs whose 
    arrangements are so thoroughly broken they cohere into ramshackle beauty.</p><p>
    
    It's a bit of a shame that Mayday don't quite live up to their towering start here, but the resulting album is still full of moments of bleary-eyed beauty and graceful wreckage, and it's hard 
    to ignore a band who does that so well.  If you like you albums with the crusts cut off, I'm afraid this one probably isn't for you, but nearly anyone who's ever found something to enjoy in 
    cheap microphones and overdriven VU meters will find something to love here.</p></div>"|5162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5162-i-know-your-troubles-been-long/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    Unfortunately, the next conscious thought I had after my slurred uttering of that phrase revolved around how my cousin's living room ceiling had 
    too many tiles for me to count without getting sick in an adjacent fireplace.  Mouth dry and stomach unsettled, my first drunken experience-- 
    at the tender age of 14-- had left me queasy, weak, and saddled with an inability to drink anything with the word ""orange"" in it for the next five years.  Happily, 
    aside from gaining valuable self-knowledge regarding the recuperative abilities of the teenage liver, the experience succeeded in teaching me the fear and

    Backwoods and brutish, moonshine is intended neither for the faint-of-heart nor those unwilling to engage in a modicum of experimentation, as it requires a

    approach Sightings' album <i>Absolutes</i> with a similar sense of cautionary adventure, preparing myself for a beautiful assault that I would inevitably and repeatedly 
    lose myself in, regardless of the consequences.</p><p>
    Anchored in the Cartesian-related premise that pain is the only thought process that will not betray one's reality, <i>Absolutes</i> begins with the organic-by-way-of-savageness 
    static feedback of ""White Keys"".  Creating an awkward and psychotic ""twist,"" the instrumentation of guitarist Mark Morgan and bassist Richard Hoffman slowly becomes 
    blurred as the song progresses, the only constant amid the cacophony being Morgan's buried yelps of ""woo-hoo"" and ""ah-ah"" that eventually collide in a gigantic screech 
    signaling the conclusion of the disc's preface.  ""Infinity of Stops"" picks up directly thereafter, as the static pulse is refurbished with a clipping beat courtesy 
    of drummer John Lockie and some squealing guitar manipulations that are similarly hacked to bits by the underlying bass line.  This too inescapably falls victim to the 
    approaching fallout of the bare percussion, a reluctant follower of the chaos that recently cleared the path for its creation and release.</p><p>
    Given the pummeling offensive the band tends to rely on, it's unexpected that Sightings outfit multiple tracks with what sounds like the sophisticated gamelan-influenced 
    playing style of the Indonesian Isles.  Perhaps as a move to admonish comments regarding the band as a second rate Boredoms or Pussy Galore-- or perhaps as 
    sheer coincidence-- ""Bishops"" begins with a tangible and lasting beat, in itself a shock coming from the No New York-influenced band, that eventually waylays an example 
    of such an Eastern-tinged rhythm into the high end of the mix.  As Morgan continues to do his best John Lydon impression, uttering nonsensical phrases and monosyllabic 
    sounds, the Javanese-esque melody eventually fades to echo only to reappear transformed in the following track, ""Canadian Money"".  Syncopating from within the belly 
    of a steel factory, the metal drums rule the track as a rapid-fire attack of humming and pounding fight and win the battle to keep above the current of rising guitar fallouts 
    and steady bass-drones.</p><p>
    Further rallying against cries of homogeneity in a field of Rock 'N Roll where such accusations are rampant and unpleasantly expected, Sightings does not rest in 
    presenting a bevy of tracks that display their knack for subtle interplay.  Possibly an inverted political message, 
    ""Right Side of the Hall"" is a D.C.-hardcore tune at heart, with vocals channeled as an animal growl and a pop-rhythm section so simple and catchy, it would be a crime to 
    bury it beneath all of that feedback-- if in the end it wasn't such a beautiful statement of artistic freedom to do so.  ""E.E."" is further evidence of the group's pop mastery, as 
    the track exemplifies in forty-five seconds what Man...or Astroman? have been attempting to accomplish for the past four years-- an Elvis Presley beach-song 
    characteristically played by the heavy machinery of a high-rise construction crew.</p><p>
    The track exists in stark contrast to the veritable jam sessions of ""Anna Mae Wong"" and ""Reduction"", both of which surpass the seven-minute mark during the unraveling of 
    their respective sound.  In the former, the group uses the moments between starts and stops to develop a suspenseful tension that eventually becomes a pattern of 
    instrumental call-and-response bringing to mind comparisons with the early improvisation of jazz and the blues.  The latter track further builds upon this, but instead of a 
    silent backdrop for the voices to argue against ""Reduction"" provides a sobering cadence, a beat that sputters out modestly in a manner befitting a composition that is showy 
    only in its lack of pretense.</p><p>
    A difficult album to take in, one should not disregard <i>Absolutes</i> based on a single listen, or even three or four.  Like the outline diagrammed on the cover for the production 
    of sweet-corn hooch, the rewards of the disc increase exponentially with repeated listens and time.  Not the sound of something new, but merely the sound of something 
    done right, Sightings has hit upon an extraordinary groove, one they will hopefully ride out to its pure and uncomplicated end.</p></div>"|7144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7144-absolutes/|8.4|Andrew Bryant

Their pedigree involved playing in John Zorn's Cobra game few years ago, and the asinine noise of Mr.     Ambarchi's early group Phlegm boasted record titles like <em>Mr. Hoo Ha Visits the Non-Stop Pissing Circus</em>. Ng was also half of the Mego macro-DJ duo, gcttcatt, a severe     shredding and scratching of the very blocks of bit sound itself. Both men have collaborated with the likes of Phill Niblock, Keith Rowe, Otomo Yoshihide, and Phillip Jeck.     You'd think <em>Vigil</em> would be as predictable as a bad Foster's commercial, but you couldn't be more wrong.</p><p>Their second record as a duo continues with emanations along the lines of 2001's <em>Reconnaissance</em>, in that each player's ego and identifiable sound is instead reduced to its most base     elements, that of pure sound glow, as warm and low as tube-amp heat, alternating blue and orange radiation. ""Vigil"", a three-part suite of suspension, opens as a distant storm     warning alarm, reaching our positions as a small drone. The sound grows naturally as slowly kindled feedback from, either guitar or record cartridge, before it's passed to and fro     in a slow game of catch with a fragile plasma ball. But is it Ambarchi with metal rubbing his amplified strings or is it Ng crab-walking on a cymbal? Their telltale gestures get lost     in the nebulous nature of the moment. Whose sound is whose is beyond determination: the duo radiate as one fuzzy entity, and probing into boundaries between the     two is pointless. Such heady analysis into the origin of these sounds would only affect your interaction with its gentle, though resolute ripples of sound particles.</p><p>The most isolated sound event is a chime at the second part of ""Vigil"", and as it rings out, it becomes apparent that these men are complimentary Tibetan prayer bowls, assuaging the air     itself with their rubbed metallic resonance and slowly walking through a cymbal wonderland, the sound clouds drifting past for twenty-one minutes. ""When Love Comes Back to     Haunt You"" is more hum-mable as the closing piece, its nimbus readily discerned, a palpable form on the horizon moving ever closer.</p>
<p>Augmenting the release are two accompanying videos from their previous record by digital artist Tina Frank (famous for her Mego cover art).  Her color bars and pixilated mists     twir like holy computer smoke along with the duo's flickering embers. Only when watching these frantic explosions do you realize that this is actually the work of a trio, which explains     why classification of these noises-- distinction between individual contribution-- is so difficult, and ultimately moot.  But Ambarchi and Ng aren't laughing at us: the     serenity they create from such small bits of chaos assures me that they'd forgive any audience its apprehension.</p>

STEERE!!!""  The backhoe shrugged mechanically in the student's hand as she cried out for the professor to come and see what she had forcefully unearthed.  Though Steere and 
    his group had been digging in the river basin for the past 30 days, aside from a few common artifacts, the main object of their search continued to elude them.</p><p>
    
    Taking care to remove the crystallized sludge surrounding the prize, he finally saw it-- the skeletal remains of what appeared to be a musically oriented tribe, 
    known as Dead Meadow, if one followed the stencil on the still half buried drum set, huddled around a central egg-crate of ancient vinyl albums and compact discs.  Cataloguing 
    the records to maintain provenience, the dig-team ran into the exact same stratigraphical paradox that Dr. Steere had predicted: in an era of music where fast-paced dance 
    tracks and flashy production techniques ruled, how did it come to pass that a collection like this could have influenced this group of musicians?  While 
    it was no surprise to find Blue Cheer's <i>Vincebus Eruptum</i>, Jimi Hendrix's <i>Axis: Bold As Love</i>, and Led Zeppelin <i>II</i> in the cinched arms of a creature a few meters 
    below Dead Meadow's remains, it was quite a shock that any group of their time was swallowing and potentially outputting this style of music.</p><p>
    
    A great boon to his research, Dr. Steere soon discovered that atop the assortment of music was a compact disc produced by Dead Meadow themselves, the group's Brendan 
    Canty-engineered third album, <i>Shivering King and Others</i>.  Finding an old player he had recently salvaged from an electronics boutique, Steere was eager to hear how well-- if at all-- 
    the group was able to integrate and build upon the work of the late 60s/early 70s, an era they appeared to hold on high.</p><p>
    
    ""I Love You Too"" certainly seemed to encapsulate the musical ideals of their inspiration, building upon a heavy Sabbath riff before Jason Simon's nasal vocals 
    threaded deep into the mix with lyrics characteristic of the fantasy-filled air about the band.  ""Babbling Flower"", ""Everything's Going On"", and ""Good 
    Moanin'"" exhibited a similar style of stomp-and-circumstance, outfitting their sound with wah-heavy guitar solos worthy of a dirty Dinosaur Jr., and a tinge of far-eastern derived 
    psychedelic rock.</p><p>
    
    Steere choked back a cry of surprise as the opening chords of ""Wayfarers All"" heralded the quiet and unexpected onslaught of an acoustic track isolated amidst the growing 
    homogeneity of ""The Whirlings"" and the meaty drone of ""Golden Cloud"".  The track put together the missing pieces of the band's problematic and massive Neil Young jones, 
    particularly the worn grooves of <i>Zuma</i>.  Though incredibly short, the song manages to appropriately prepare the listener for the similar acoustic leanings of ""Shivering King"", exercising 
    some of the prettiest harmonic ornamentation found on the album.  This initially light melodic line is eventually overtaken by an undulating drum pattern and fuzzy-bass that serves as 
    an interesting counterpoint to the introduction of various high-end guitar techniques.</p><p>
    
    Jaw resting on fist, Dr. Steere grew weary near the end of the composition, nodding off at least twice during the fourteen minutes that comprise the final two tracks ""Heaven"" and 
    ""Raise the Sails"".  While the sitar sounds of the former and the Sonic Boom-drone of the latter did create an interesting soundscape for the album's climax, the sameness 
    of the music had become irritating after an hour.  Steere eventually found himself questioning the group's reasons not to trim some of the excess fat, but he was won over by the 
    consolation that such invariability only further highlighted the musical bond the group has with the virtuosic pomp of its idols.</p><p>
    
    Weaned on the tenets of ""Dinosaur Rock"", Dead Meadow does put too much stock in the belief that more truly is more, resulting in drawn-out passages not unlike those that 
    plagued nearly all of the artists they worship.  But they succeed in their drive to not merely reproduce but improve, beefing up their sound with influences ranging 
    from post-rock to black-metal, proving that one doesn't need an army of synthesizers and fashion consultants.  Dead Meadow embodies the modus behind archaeology: 
    in order to move forward, it's sometimes necessary to look back.</p></div>"|2214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2214-shivering-king-and-others/|7.8|Andrew Bryant

Alternating heartrending drone and quietly affecting folk carved by taciturn 
    hermits, <i>Of Things Too Sorrowful to be Reminded of, and Things Too Beautiful to Possess</i> speaks through distant symbols, inky clouds, and 
    thin pine-needle patterns on the floor. According to the sliver of black paper attached to the scorched-leaf sleeve, Rob Fisk and Ben Chasny spent 
    five or so years collecting the spare coal-scented sounds contained here: written in Alaska and California, they recorded each section in California on a 
    4-track between 1998-2003 with only a couple of overdubs, using two guitars, two amplifiers, an organ, a violin, and miscellaneous bells and sticks.</p><p>
    Far from anonymous backwoods strummers, Fisk is a co-founder of Deerhoof and spent six years in the band. He left after <i>Halfbird</i> (which preceded 
    last year's acclaimed <i>Reveille</i>), moving to Alaska with his wife, former Deerhoof keyboardist Kelly Goode. There, they built a log cabin. When they cozied 
    themselves they started the art-pop band 7 Year Rabbit Cycle and got the idea for their Free Porcupine Society record label. Ben Chasny is the wonderful, 
    acid-folk Six Organs of Admittance: he and Fisk have been friends for years, using Badgerlore recording sessions as an excuse to get together, to notch 
    bits of beauty into their ongoing collaboration. (For you completists, they also have a split CD called <i>Three Owls - Six Ears</i> with A Warm Palindrome and 
    Feverdreams, which was released on Betley Welcomes Careful Drivers a couple of years ago).</p><p>
    The closest analogue I can pin to these largely improvised guitar duets is <i>Sidereal Rest</i>, a collection of muted firefly music released in 1995 by the 
    Vancouver-based label Scratch. That compilation featured otherwise noisy bands like Noggin, Pork Queen, and Caroliner making bedtime music alongside 
    seminal underground stalwarts like US Saucer, Paste, Loren Mazzacane, Thinking Fellers, and Bugskull. Badgerlore's 
    work could be transplanted anywhere into <i>Sidereal Rest</i> and make sense sonically: a document to cozy-to when the late-night humming of rogue cloud 
    formations keep you from getting shuteye. Their earthy commune music might also be compared to less-vocal Woven Hand, Doldrums, the Blithe Sons' 
    apocalyptic-minded cousins, warped-out Alan Bishop, Skullflower's organic-farming neighbors up the road.</p><p>
    ""Prayer"", the briefest of the ten tracks, layers tapping wood, ringing bells, and a male Sara Vaughan invoking wood spirits with a twisted, 
    slow-core hillbilly raga. ""Culling The Fire Lions"" uses the ancient feedback of Nurse With Wound/Current 93 to investigate veiny lines on crumbling 
    leaves, to call forth a purifying agent to clear the slate of good and bad.  In the noisy ""A Girl's Mouth In Winter"" a stricken voice intones: ""We yell 
    in her mouth, but nothing comes back/ Her tongue and eyes look straight past me/ And in the springtime, she asked for a glass of water/ And everyone 
    cried."" It's a redwood falling over, weighed down with too much ice, space, and memory. On ""The Ruiner"", spare vocals commingle as a lovely duet over 
    a crumbling bell; listening close, I could feel my beard growing cold with hoarfrost.</p><p>
    On their signature anthem ""Folk Music For No One"", I see two guys buried beneath a blanket giving prayers to the gods of dew, raggedly 
    dancing. ""It's Cold, it's dark/ But we plant in a month"" recalls Seattle's Climax Golden Twins, a man who fell in love with the moon, poetry painting the human spirit as 
    charcoal; it also creates the album's biggest groove. For the most part, Badgerlore resist that sort of coalescing, and I'm always impressed by folks who 
    avoid the tendency to resolve into a hook: by nature, it's more difficult to avoid catchiness than to succumb to it.</p><p>
    Towards the end of the album, the delicately fucked Wiccan church music of ""Listen, Loved Ones"" commands gently, ""Loved ones, find a safe place to view 
    this digrace/\xA0Hold each other tight through the dark night..."" In the future, I'm sure they'll gather together their blackened embers, build a happier 
    fort, and escape to a higher vantage point; here, these pipers at the gates of dusk are holed up against the the witching hour, creating 
    beauty within a crumbling, musky night.</p></div>"|524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/524-of-things-too-sorrowful-to-be-reminded-of-and-things-too-beautiful-to-possess/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

He had the requisite 
    demented imagination to put those creepy backdrops into cLOUDDEAD-- like deserts swept with worn-out electrical storms-- and ""Eviction Notice"", that 
    track he did for Sage Francis, was the scariest nightmare a kid ever had.  But it was the rough crackle of vinyl and cheap reproduction that clinched it: 
    Odd Nosdam's productions sounded like they'd been made on a tape recorder fished out of the trash; broke-ass, unreliable and stained by everything that had 
    gone through the alley he was creeping through when he found it.  It sounded like personal history, and nothing's weirder than that.</p><p> 
    
    So right away, his second full-length sounds suspiciously clean.  These twenty-four untitled instrumentals aren't as random as the collages on his <i>Split EP</i> with Why?, 
    as hostile as <i>Plan 9: Meat Your Hypnotist</i>, or as atmospheric as the cLOUDDEAD beats: for the first time, it sounds like he sat down in a good studio and carefully 
    assembled a record.  That's good, in that Odd Nosdam's production rode out the lo-fi thing for exactly long enough before moving on; but it's also a 
    disappointment, because the new work isn't far off from where he was before-- it recycles a lot of his ideas with none of his usual edginess.</p><p> 
    
    The first half of the record flashes his sense of humor and kitsch-fetish.  He's funny when he plays crappy Sunday School records; it's still a laugh when he 
    drops heavy jack-boot beats on top of a silly or tacky song-- ""Fish Heads"" in one case, some goofy polka in another.  Track six uses a 50s-era demonstration 
    record for the Magnus Electric Chord Organ: a salesman is showing some rubes how to play, but the minute they touch the organ Odd Nosdam subs in thick, funky 
    chords and beats. It's an obvious ""stomp on something square with something hip"" joke, but it still works for me-- and the fat, blatting chords are the meatiest 
    music on the record.</p><p> 
    
    That's also one of the ""funkiest"" tracks on an album that leans as much on oom-pah beats and random style-jumps as ""straight"" hip-hop.  Like a collage of 
    soundtracks to old TV commercials he mixes eccentric voices and cheesy exotica, sometimes cutting abruptly but not so much as to suggest a deficient attention 
    span.  It sounds like it's building to something exciting-- but he falters.</p><p> 
    
    When the polka on track eleven gives way to a slow, shimmering setting of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"", the record takes a turn underwater: the music moves like a 
    submarine, lurking with just its periscope poking out to show a sign of life.  The last twelve tracks meander at a plodding tempo that comes off as 
    samey, even murky.  With strings and beats here, moaning electronics there, each piece is carefully arranged but tame.  Track twenty-one's hostile melody and militant 
    beats leap out next to the other, more passive cuts, but all together the pieces are too methodical, like he's just working through the DJ Shadow Exercise Workbook.</p><p> 
    
    It wouldn't be constructive to criticize the record for not sounding ""weird"" enough, though that's always been part of Odd Nosdam's appeal-- the sheer inventiveness 
    and constant development of his voice.  <i>No More Wig For Ohio</i> takes a step forward in craftsmanship and patience, and it's a tighter and more accomplished record 
    than the random, sometimes hard-to-digest bedroom recordings that started his carer.  But it also lacks the tension: the juxtaposition of novelty vinyl with atmospheric 
    horror, or the disorientation of his collages.  Even his less successful albums were more gripping-- and more personal.  <i>No More Wig For Ohio</i> cops out on its more tantalizing promise 
    of something more sinister below the surface-- all this disc really tells us is that Odd Nosdam's a solid DJ who likes doofy vinyl.</p></div>"|6088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6088-no-more-wig-for-ohio/|6.7|Chris Dahlen

    observing shuttles of children on the Sussex coast.  During his vivid flashback, a pack of sun-thirsty
    bullies shove a schoolboy, wearing ""shivering shorts,"" into the asphalt.  Betjeman holds the antagonists
    in rancorous contempt, brand-name addicts who serve as irrefutable proof that the Devil walks amongst us.
    Domino four-piece Clearlake call the same Sussex coast home, and sound like the sort of kids in shivering
    shorts whose skin thickened from playground pushes.  But instead of marveling under the iron ribs of St.
    Pancras or hunting Cornish abbeys-- as did Betjemen, who vented through art and eventually found solace
    in Britain's spiritual architecture-- Clearlake construct their own echoing places of worship in <i>Cedars</i>,
    with some help from the Cocteau Twins' Simon Raymonde.</p><p>
    
    With the band's arcane 2001 debut, <i>Lido</i>, behind him, lyricist Jason Pegg clouds his nostalgia with
    fear and devilry.  As drums clap like pew-kneelers under buttresses of strings on ""The Mind Is Evil"", Pegg
    warns like a grimacing choirboy, ""it makes me do all those unspeakable things."" This veiling of coal-colored
    sentiment in majestic settings runs through every track.  In ""Keep Smiling"", the lines ""Just nod your head
    accordingly and do the opposite of anything they tell you"" mirror Thom Yorke's <i>Hail to the Thief</i>
    manifesto, but Pegg's de-politicized subversion strikes harder-- as unlike Yorke's reaction against the
    obvious, with his willingness to point the finger inward to less-admittable wickedness.  Elsewhere,
    processional whipcracks of percussion and paint-chipped baby grands drive him to admit ""I wouldn't hurt
    a fly, but I'd really like to punish you"" on ""I'd Like to Hurt You"", suggesting that any of us can snap
    under pressure-- whether that pressure results from government, the anxious Zeitgeist, or ex-girlfriends,
    Pegg doesn't say, but the universal ambiguity of his sentiments injects the music with a raw and timeless
    nature.</p><p>
    
    The inherently uplifting alto in Pegg's lucid, lachrymose throat reverberates touches of Tin Pan
    Alley, layering Clearlake's sound beyond the typical moping of today's frontmen.  One can almost picture him
    singing these songs to a starlet as he ambles across an opera-house stage.  Chopped-up streaks of a flanged
    keyboard even whip through ""Almost the Same"" like stagehands hustling backdrops in Rodgers and Hart's
    <i>Autobahn: The Musical</i>.</p><p>
    
    Throughout <i>Cedars</i>, Clearlake continually find beauty in melancholy and melancholy behind beauty,
    while raising your hairs in reverence with occasional guitar squalls.  Murals of feedback, keyboards, and
    chanting close in around ""Come into the Darkness"". As Pegg inverts the Golden Rule into a mantra of selfish
    motivation on ""Treat Yourself with Kindness"", lurching chords burst up the walls like shadows springing in
    sudden bold bars of light through stained glass. The drama segues into the closing hymn of ""Trees in the
    City"", where hope is found in the resilient growth of greenery in a smoky metropolis.</p><p>
    
    Betjeman too bemoaned the ""Motopolis"" that choked the charm from Oxford and the suburban sprawl of Slough
    with the blackest of humor. The British love to honor through a lacerating wit. It seems almost as if
    modernity is tolerated only with the thought that one day humanity will lose and the English countryside
    will expel the scars of society. Sauron will fall. Clearlake fit into this tradition as true patriots.
    While <i>Lido</i> may have been a last bastion of Britpop, <i>Cedars</i> towers in the tradition of the
    best British art.</p></div>"|1495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1495-cedars/|9.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

""When
    the vision's getting blurry, when you can't handle yer liquor or yer speed,"" I said, ""cover one eye and
    your head'll stop spinning. It takes that binocular dilemma right out of there so you can see straight.
    Visionary or not, it's easy to steer straight with only one eye working.""</p><p>
    Glenn Branca knows nothing about this: he was never one to limit his vision.  Seeing Rock out of one side
    and Academic out the other, the two only blurred together in his third eye. By 1981, Branca had already
    played in Rhys Chatham's Guitar Trio for four years, and had disbanded his No Wave groups Theoretical Girls
    and The Static to focus on larger movements for amplified guitar. He had even completed compositions like
    ""Lesson No.1"" and ""Dissonance"", bringing to light the possibilities for multiple guitars beyond the Molly
    Hatchet formations of the early 70s.</p><p>
    But the group he assembled to play a rare tour of the States around 1980 would cohere in such a way as to
    make his most recent work to that point, ""The Ascension"", his most fully realized.  Featuring David
    Rosenbloom from downtown group Chinese Puzzle, as well as future Sonic Youth guitar-beating beat Lee Ranaldo,
    the piece was scored for four guitars, bass, and drums; his sextet was Times Square neon and the ghost-light
    luminance of the city at 3 a.m. focused into a laser-like intensity.</p><p>
    It was ferocity never seen nor heard
    before, not even on that coast-to-coast tour, where the guitars would slash it out on stage nightly, roaring
    alive like the 6 train, one-eyed through dank tunnels across the country. Trying to capture that essence in
    the elitist Power Station studio, even Ranaldo-- in his excellent liner notes for this reissue-- admits it
    was hard to recreate the actual beast.  Whatever Weasel Walter was able to glean digital remastering from
    is unbeknownst to me, but this thing is fucking huge.</p><p>
    You can sure bet Branca knows about driving drunk: he swerves about on these city streets between two musical
    extremes like a pilled-n-pompadoured Popeye Doyle on his way to the <i>French Connection</i> set. On one
    hand, he seems to be in the slow lane with all the Sunday drivers moving to Brahms and Buckner on the West
    Side Highway, making symphonic movements with the blinker on for miles before the turn. Riding on the
    Neu!-like toms of Stephan Wischerth and a bassline that lunges out like Drive Like Jehu, the four guitars
    in ""Lesson No.2"" quickly gain on traffic, buzzing and droning about 88 miles faster than anyone else clogging
    the lanes. It sounds almost reckless, as he steers and swerves the guitars into the other lanes, right at
    the oncoming lights of punk-crushed cars, weaving in and out of traffic, and then suddenly cutting down dark
    Chinatown alleys of urban rot.  Your knuckles turn white, clinging to the door handles-- it feels so out of
    control, but every movement has been precisely laid-out.</p><p>
    ""The Spectacular Commodity"" is precision defined, the massive guitars gleaming like metal and glass towers
    in a grand opening movement, its bass menacing the very foundations with a low rumble. The
    manic speed of the piece increases to white-hot levels of crashing, cacophonous overtone; from these bloodied
    guitar strings and twisted metal carnage you can discern not just the euphoric guitar bliss of everyone from
    Sonic Youth to My Bloody Valentine, but also the mighty crescendos of Sigur Rós, Mogwai, Black Dice, Godspeed
    You Black Emperor!, or whomever, here executed with a plasma-like energy and melodic/harmonic structure still
    light-years beyond the forenamed.</p><p>
    ""Light Field (In Consonance)"" is as majestic as its title would suggest: guitars rain down like torrents from
    thunderclouds, but with a savagery typical of back alley stabbings. When the guitar strikes like sheets of
    lightning into these ascendant runs at the apex, it's as anthemic and all-powerful as anything I've ever
    heard from a six-stringed electric, in rock or any experimental context.</p><p>
    I've had the symphony of the streets do a little winking dance in a light drizzle to Monk's solo piano
    playing before, I've had Ellington make the lights of Broadway glimmer and dance for miles. <i>White
    Light/White Heat</i> split my skull open with the cold cruelty of the last exit to Brooklyn, while <i>Paul's
    Boutique</i> foretold the coke-smoking pleasures of the <i>Vice</i> lifestyle ten years before I arrived.
    <i>Daydream Nation</i> carved out the skyscraper shapes and dungeon scrapes of the sewer below in sound,
    but none of these quintessential New York records made every single movement of the Gotham populous move as
    one quivering entity in my head as does Branca's finale, ""The Ascension"".</p><p>
    Every step pounded out on concrete, every seeping bag of dragged garbage, every rat squeal, every
    metal-on-metal cry of the arriving train on the third rail, every disfigured bum, and all the echoing voices
    seem to be notated for these detuned guitars. The nasty city these compositions were birthed in appears no
    longer to be with us. A ghost city, seemingly isolated to Martin Scorsese and Abel Ferrera videos, still
    haunts us as an ineffable layer over the cleaned city of Disney, as brutal and terrifying as the city has
    always been. She's never left; it's nice to have her back.</p></div>"|909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/909-the-ascension/|10.0|Andy Beta

    the session.  That's precisely what Steffen Basho Junghans does for each of his albums, though; he just sets up and plays his acoustic guitars 
    without so much as an overdub to hide behind nor a quick edit to cover his ass.  He's so sure-fingered on the fretboard that it frequently 
    sounds like there are two or three people picking away at the steel string, but it's always just him and his craft, which by this point 
    (he's almost fifty years old), he's completely mastered.</p><p>
    
    Junghans' solo acoustic pieces, written for both six and twelve-stringed instruments, are nothing if not deeply bound to the earth.  Even 
    his most esoteric, experimental work-- like last year's astoundingly inventive <i>Waters in Azure</i>-- has a deeply naturalistic feel to it; you can almost 
    smell the forests of his native Eastern Germany in the pinpoint picking.  <i>Rivers &amp; Bridges</i> opens up with a twenty-two minute (!) meditation called ""The 
    River Suite"", which while not strictly a suite, nevertheless embodies the flow of a river across miles of rolling terrain, to a tee.  Rapidly cascading 
    tremolo picking and sweeping strums burst like foam from rapids into the air, before the piece widens out , flattening for a lazy roll through less 
    dramatic surroundings.</p><p>
    
    ""The River Suite"" is complemented by another lengthy piece called ""The Takoma Bridge Incident"", an obvious reference to John Fahey's label, which 
    nurtured the early careers of such acoustic guitar visionaries as Robbie Basho (to whom Junghans pays tribute, taking his name as a part of his 
    own), Leo Kottke, and Fahey himself.  These guitarists (and a few others like Sandy Bull, and perhaps Ry Cooder) are the most obvious point of comparison for 
    Junghans' own work, but rather than simply walk in their footsteps, he continues their quest to push the very boundaries of the acoustic guitar.</p><p>
    
    To this end, his work also frequently calls to mind the classical music of India, with its narrow harmonic scope and constant pedal points.  
    For all its myriad permutations, ""Takoma Bridge"" remains incredibly consistent in the scales and chords it employs; the 
    best section is a brief but breathtaking passage where he drops in brilliantly bright harmonics for color-- acoustic guitar harmonics 
    sound so rich on a twelve-string, and he uses the instrument's resonance to his full advantage.</p><p>
    
    Four shorter pieces round out the record, and each is masterfully executed in its own way.  ""Rainbow Dancing"" (the other piece written for twelve-string) 
    is very Appalachian in the way it blends a hesitant verse with rolling, dramatically articulated chord changes in the intervening sections.  ""Hear the Winds 
    Coming"" is yet another example of Junghans' facility for literal titles, as the first chords really do sound like the wind kicking up in great, dusty gusts.  And 
    ""Epilogue"" is just plain pretty, highlighting the simple pleasure of unadorned playing like little else I've heard since Jorma Kaukonen's ""Embryonic Journey"" 
    sweetened the second side of Jefferson Airplane's <i>Surrealistic Pillow</i>.</p><p>
    
    I'm curious as to how Junghans will be viewed in another twenty years, because I see him as the logical inheritor of the original Takoma ethos, and 
    he's certainly the most consistent practitioner of it since Basho and Fahey both passed on early.  <i>Rivers &amp; Bridges</i>, for its part, doesn't so much 
    move the acoustic guitar forward as encapsulate much of what the instrument can do in an accessible manner.  It's a beautiful album, and solo 
    acoustic music doesn't get much better than this.</p></div>"|575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/575-rivers-bridges/|7.8|Joe Tangari

The band's debut <i>Oceanless</i> was filled
    with long, dreamy instrumentals that combined the Young-meets-dreampop bend of Windy &amp; Carl with streaks of heavier stoner psychedelia. The follow-up
    full length <i>Seasons</i> saw them settling uneasily into soft, delicate slowcore territory, mixing lots of acoustic guitars with strained harmonies,
    verses and choruses. This year's <i>Fade In Fade Out</i> EP was a mixture of the two styles, with a pronounced lean toward the drones of <i>Oceanless</i>. 
    Landing is prolific as hell-- several members have combined with Adam Forkner to record two Surface of Eceon records in the last two years-- but they're restless,
    trying to figure out how to tie their ideas together.</p><p>
    On <i>Passages Through</i>, Landing is slowly finding a way to integrate their wistful, open-ended guitarscapes with proper songs.  They've kept all of the 
    melody and most of the structure of <i>Seasons</i>, but the singing is more accomplished if it's a bit further down in the mix. Most important, during the best 
    moments of <i>Passages Through</i>, Landing have given tracks the space to wander when they need to; the album feels open, and unforced. The 
    word ""experiment"" implies a certain amount of forethought and control-- this record that is about letting go.</p><p>
    ""Close Your Eyes, Slowly"" is Landing perfectly realized. The drummer lays out for the first three minutes and allows two guitars-- playing overlapping
    scales in a repeating minimalist style-- to braid a rope to the clouds so that Adrienne Snow's voice, mixed just right to add an ethereal glow, might
    ascend into the mist. Adrienne's husband Aaron also sings in Landing, but the timbre of Adrienne's voice is better suited to the busier guitar
    songs, bonding nicely with the circular, heavily reverbed patterns the band favors. Another example is the first bit of ""Breathing"", which begins as a
    drifting, shapeless mass, her voice floating between the guitars without tune until the track settles into a serene drone, modulated by tremelo-bar
    ripples (it confidently stretches past 14 minutes). As a ""song"" it's about 80% coda, and that makes perfect sense for this style of music. The nine-minute opener
    ""Wings of Light"" also manages to combine hints of song with an appealing tangle of guitar drone.</p><p>
    When constructing more disciplined pieces, Landing shows some signs of improvement. ""Hold Me Under"" shares the Low aspirations hinted at on
    <i>Seasons</i>, but comes closer to that high standard with tighter harmonies and a better melody. Still, the acoustic ballads remain Landing's sticking
    point. While the Adrienne-sung ""It is Shining"" is interesting enough in the way its wide-eyed folkiness harks back to early 10,000 Maniacs (an 80s sound 
    few would touch these days), ""Wrapped Up in Flight"" and ""Tell Myself"" are pretty on the surface, but ultimately dull. When Landing
    sounds too relaxed and effortless, their music just seems strangely hollow, the indie guitar band equivalent of a Thomas Kincaid painting. Fortunately,
    such moments are rare enough on <i>Passages Through</i>.</p></div>"|4670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4670-passages-through/|7.5|Mark Richardson

Representing the 
    onslaught of global culture, media and technology invite temptation to over-saturate, and though that may be one accurate portrait of the (post) 
    modern world, I'm not sure it's the most realistic.</p><p>
    
    Artists like John Oswald, John Zorn and Otomo Yoshihide have specialized in a kind of caricature of this world in their music: taking bits and pieces 
    of information and entertainment around them, they pieced together rather intimidating documents of what would be a disorientating environment to say the 
    least.  Flashes of light, shrieks, blasts of electricity, jagged, jump-cut samples racing by before we know what hit us: if every night were New Years' 
    Eve in Times Square, and all the while murder, childbirth and war were raging in the streets, this would be the perfect soundtrack.  But every 
    day is not like this.</p><p>
    
    Former Boredoms' guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto seems to recognize the space in between the chaos.  It's not for lack of activity in his world: in addition 
    to 15-year stint with Boredoms, he has led his own bands Omoide Hatoba, Rashinban and Akabushi, and performed with Rovo, Most, Novo Tono and Ontoko. 
      He also owns the influential Osaka club Bears where scores of hopeful young noise-addicts try to prove their dissonance on a nightly basis.  
    Furthermore, Yamamoto has released a handful of solo guitar albums, wherein he joins the scratching-and-clawing ranks of fellow improvisers Fred Frith 
    and Eugene Chadbourne.  His musical experience is as varied as it is longstanding, and I wouldn't blame him for turning to skronk now and again.</p><p>
<i>Nu Frequency</i>, Yamamoto's fourth solo release, demonstrates that you don't need to explode into schizophrenic noise to run the gamut of lively 
    sensations.  Working with the excellent female drummer China, Yamamoto concocts a sprawling mix of free jazz-informed ensemble interaction, 
    post-rock production (think To Rococo Rot, not Sigur Ros) and his own shimmering, restless guitar.  Whenever a melody appears, it's quickly 
    obscured by rogue percussion or a sudden bass spike.  Throughout, rather than emphasize the traditional, he opts for the extreme, but instead of 
    amounting to an hour of pummeling hysterics, <i>Nu Frequency</i> is a sustained journey into the unresolved and mundane.  The ""frequency"" may be at times 
    piercing, rumbling or soothing, but taken as a whole, Yamamoto's spectrum of sound is even-keeled and non-confrontational.</p><p>
    
    After the short, shiny introduction of ""Convergence"", ""Acceleration"" comes on like a small orchestra of contemporary jazz spirits.  China's 
    ever-tapping cymbals propose a meter that isn't restricted by actual time, while multiple guitars noodle away in the distance.  Synthesized flutes cry 
    over deep, repetitive bass lines, both of which give way to Yamamoto's chord clusters.  If it sounds like a mess, it's probably more than you think.  
    Still, it strikes me as a perfectly natural distillation of just about everything the composer has been doing musically over the past few years, 
    only all at once.  ""Seed"" continues the off-kilter mix, but does offer a passive melody via guitars and a piano line that is somewhere between 
    counterpoint and just being lost.  Flighty, top-heavy percussion makes things seem more disorganized than they really are, and much in the same way 
    Scott LaFaro's basslines gave Bill Evans room to stretch, Yamamoto offers himself ample canvas over which to splatter.</p><p>
    
    There are moments of eclectic beauty, as on ""Yarn"", wherein the composer uses only a guitar to create a faint, calm tonality under which clicks, 
    sputters and reverberated feedback dance like the last sparks of dying fire.   In other hands, the balance of ambience and experimentalism might not 
    hold, but here it's the model of poignancy.  And of course, the album ends on a kinetic, drum-led track that wouldn't sound out of place on a Rovo disc-- 
    I guess there's no accounting for flow.  Nevertheless, for most of the album, you'll probably be able to drift off into near-trance without fear of 
    reproach or noise explosions.  Nice and uneasy.</p></div>"|8893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8893-nu-frequency/|7.2|Dominique Leone

    described as a roundabout introduction to this group of German renaissance men.  The first Notwist album to 
    receive a proper stateside release (1995's <i>12</i>) was actually their third; the US version of <i>12</i> 
    featured a very minor radio hit-- at least in the New England area--  called ""The Incredible Change of Our Alien"" (befitting 
    all this convolution, the  track was actually a remix of a track from the Notwist's 2nd album, <i>Nook</i>, greedily appended 
    to our version of <i>12</i>).</p><p>
    
    Soon after <i>Shrink</i> (1998), the Notwist found themselves without American representation when their label 
    Zero Hour went belly up.  Had Zero Hour not cashed in its chips, there's a fine chance that the hubbub that rightfully 
    enveloped the band's 2002's <i>Neon Golden</i> might have come four years earlier.  In yet another case of 
    ""better late than never,"" the Notwist did finally receive their well-deserved props, which means most of their unavailable 
    back catalog is sure to be re-released in America.  I imagine the multitude of praise heaped upon Notwist-affiliated outfits 
    such as Lali Puna, the Tied &amp; Tickled Trio, and Console also played a part in this recent surge of interest; it's the 
    Notwist's seamless combination of rock foundations with the IDM blips and jazzy squeals these ""side projects"" are known for 
    that led people to take notice of the Notwist.</p><p>
    
    Those with a vested interest in the group's origin have undoubtedly come across biographies that begin with some 
    variation on, ""The Notwist began as a heavy metal/hardcore punk group...""  Anyone undeterred by 
    this statement, still itching to get your hands on this album, hoping to find small bits-- even a hint of a hint of a hint of the casual 
    eclecticism that embodies the excellence of the Notwist's last two albums-- might want to keep their money in the piggy bank for 
    a little while longer.  Those biographers playing fast &amp; loose with genres weren't full of themselves: this record 
    features a good helping of double bass drum action, consistent cymbal abuse, guitar fret squealing and wheedling, lots of 
    chords chug-chug-chugging, and even a few spots where Markus Acher (he of the laconic Teutonic vocalizing) 
    actually essays a few disgruntled ur-screamo barks.  Suffice it to say that the kindler, gentler musical backdrops of modern-day 
    Notwist flatter Acher's voice more than the band's headbanging material of thirteen years' past.</p><p>
    
    Outside of one relatively jovial &amp; chirpy track introduction (the first 60 seconds of Yatsura soundalike ""Seasons""), this album 
    positions itself alongside the indie rock bastions that best approximated heavy metal via smashing the punk rock (just 
    about anyone on Touch &amp; Go circa 1993, a good number of now-forgotten bands on Homestead) and the current class 
    underground bands not afraid to shove metal straight up your ass (Neurosis, Converge, and the Hydrahead roster).  Once in a while, 
    these two worlds collide-- the concluding track ""Nothing Like You"" would pass for pro-forma slack motherfucker-y were it not for the 
    30 seconds of bridging riffage thrown in at the 2:30 mark, and ""I've Not Forgotten You"" segues from apocalyptic anvil-banging 
    into spry indie sprints.</p><p>
    
    In some places, there's even a bit of loud fast ruling, Minneapolis style-- the soloing in ""Be Reckless"" could just as easily 
    have come out of Bob Mould's Flying V as it could from some Aquanetted Yngwie disciple, and ""Think For Yourself"" wouldn't be 
    out of place as an extra track on <i>Everything Falls Apart</i> (excepting the Dinosaur Jr. moves thrown in between fist pumps).  
    Other tracks (""Is It Fear"", ""K. Das Devil"", ""One Wasted"") are less shameless about their affinity for rock of a harder vintage-- 
    feel free to imagine the effect (deleterious or otherwise) Germany's biggest rock export, the Scorpions, had on these 
    impressionable kinder.</p><p>
<i>Notwist</i> is an interesting confluence of guitar-rock influences, if the finer points might be lost on 
    folks unable to get past the somewhat egregious presence of various metal tropes; it might prove even 
    more difficult if one associates the fret runs and riffage with the set of Hot Topic chain wallet groups currently vying for 
    their 2 spots on the TRL countdown, but that certainly doesn't mean it's not worth hearing.  In light of what's followed, though, 
    this album pales in comparison, and anyone dead-set on finding anything resembling recent Notwist 
    high points like ""Pilot"" or ""Day 7"" would be better served waiting for the next Notwist album.</p></div>"|5844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5844-notwist/|6.5|David Raposa

    as every bit hideous as ""MacArthur Park"". If we're to trust ""The Park Slope Song"" and others on James
    William Hindle's album <i>Prospect Park</i>, this musician-friendly Brooklyn neighborhood (where I happen
    to reside) is an almost disturbingly fine place to live.  Apparently, it's like the new Haight Asbury or
    something. In fact, judging from the number of references to sunshine, birds, and other cheerily pleasant
    phenomena, it's closer to Michael Chabon's mythic <i>Summerland</i> than to any earthly location. This thesis is
    supported by the album's gossamer arrangements, featuring every instrument capable of issuing a gentle
    chime: mandolin, glockenspiel and the rest. Hindle sells you on a dippy Park Slope mythos previously peddled 
    in the movie <i>Smoke</i>, and better than any realtor could, because he appears thoroughly sold
    on it himself.</p><p>
    
    Woozily romantic, slighly soggy and by all indications dedicated to the members of the author's immediate
    family, ""Prospect Park"" is the definition of innocuousness. Hindle thanks Beachwood Sparks and a
    couple of erstwhile Elephant Six-ers in his liner notes, but he doesn't really belong with that crowd. I
    would rather place him-- cruelly, perhaps-- in the granola-folk school of Dar Williams, Lucy Kaplansky 
    and Richard Shindell: consider him the lost fourth cryer in <i>Cry Cry Cry</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""You Will Be Safe"" opens the album on a decidedly therapeutic note, albeit contradicted by churlish
    guitars. After the not-quite-jazzy ""Come Down Slowly"", Hindle makes the mortal mistake of starting a song
    called ""Leaving Trains"" with the riff and strum from Sheryl Crow's ""Strong Enough"". That the album recovers
    at all is testament to Hindle's songwriting and charisma.</p><p>
    
    The two highlights here are ""The Country Song""-- not an actual C&amp;W; number but rather a Simon &amp; Garfunkel
    tune garnished with banjo-- and ""The Great Woodland Summer"". Picking things up halfway through the album,
    the song is fast by Hindle's languid standards, as well as surprisingly R.E.M.-ish-- although it has to
    overcome a monumentally dorky title and a couple of mewling licks toward the end, the kind 
    Peter Buck wouldn't be caught dead with. </p><p>
    
    It's a short affair-- 35 minutes-- but enough to finish while drinking your double capuccino. If I sound unenthused
    about the record, it's for the most part indie snobbery. We like our folk rock  haunting (Nina
    Nastasia, Neko Case) or haunted by Brian Wilson. Hindle, on the other hand, seems genuinely happy to be
    here. And if you think he's irrepairably fixated on Park Slope, take solace in a song called ""Hoboken"": 
    perhaps his next CD-length ode to the patterns of yuppie migration is already in the works.</p></div>"|3872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3872-prospect-park/|6.1|Michael Idov

    front-woman Beth Ditto, whose blistering, blues-reeling yowl has established some goddamn fully realized roots for the band's punk-inflected garage rock. 
    It's Ditto who pushes the Gossip above the majority of their genre's not-so-great, middling pretenders. You need go no further than ""Nite"", the 
    grinding opener on their second full-length <i>Movement</i>, to realize these shaggy, Ramones-loving stylistics are channel surfing Etta James, Janis 
    Joplin, Bessie Smith, and dusty country roads-- not Nina Hagen, like so much of the pack. Ozark garage rock! Queer-positive Leadbelly!</p><p>
    My adoration isx92t unadulterated. I do indeed like dirty, swaggering music, but beyond Ditto's substantial vocal prowess, the band doesn't often push 
    the artistic envelope. I'm not stubbornly naïve enough to think every band needs to pull out the analog tape-loop machine and KK Null back catalogue, 
    but when these guys opt to compliment Ditto's voice by swerving left and experimenting with their relatively bare 
    instrumentation, the off-kilter results raise the band's output to a different level of sweet-home goodness. Conversely, when they  
    stick hard and fast to standard formations, these enfant terribles lose steam and dissolve inertly into to the white-striped background.</p><p>
    I grew up wearing a Royal Trux t-shirt and playing drums in a shaky teenage band that covered Flipper's ""Sex Bomb"". Ever since I was that high-school 
    chump with a confused head for taking apart instruments, I knew half the battle with my beloved genre was overcoming similarity. 
    The essential aspect of seminal noise-fuck bands like Pussy Galore and Royal Trux was a preternatural ability to incorporate punk and art-rock into 
    standard 1960's garage and a lifetime of cribbed rhythm and blues. Sadly, at this point, even one side of <i>Dial M For Motherfucker</i> or <i>Twin Infinitives</i> 
    still out-punches the entire oeuvres of so many of today's well-dressed hacks.</p><p>
    I'm blabbering about composition because the cracks in the Gossip's straightforward sheen point toward a previously unseen horizon 
    splattered orange, pink, and dark purple. What if they upped their already substantial ante by making their work more patchwork? Ditto's vocal 
    acrobatics tank when the music behind her doesn't progress from Olympia style bass-less guitar mush backed by primitive drums. When you rely on one 
    guitar you should take a nod from Mecca Normal: develop a mile-high stack of riffs. As of now, I'm left picking at guitar god scraps.</p><p>
<i>Movement</i>'s best moments are transitions: the slice of guitar noise at the end of the beautifully distraught ""Yesterday's News""; ""Gone"" 
    becomes an unaccompanied hand-clap sing-a-long at its coda, transforming the track into a wonderfully anonymous punk-rock spiritual; after a pause at the 
    end of ""Light Light Sleep"", a repetitive guitar chops it up, and Ditto's notes explode, taking flight. Though there are only a few of these shifts 
    in recording textures and gradations, these glitches in tonal quality impart a beautiful dissymmetry to the sermon, adding a muddy Tower 
    Recordings underbelly to the band's approach.</p><p>
    The Gossip sound best when flowing through lo-fi constraints: when they dox92t have a hi-hat, and the down-tuned guitar is missing string. When the 
    music's boxier, Ditto's voice soars; when the guitar and bass evoke a boom-box recording, the muck of the dank room warps into a golden treasure trove. 
    In the spirit of shitty recordings, I look forward to their upcoming live release on Dim Mak, which was culled from <i>Non-Dead In NYC</i> (a cassette the 
    band ran only 50 copies of themselves). Maybe they could use that raw tape hiss and a razor blade to create a complexly recalibrated remix album?</p><p>
    Whatever. Even if my experimental pipe dream doesx92t come to fruition, I really like it when people make music out of junk, and the Gossip do indeed 
    concoct boozy sun-drunk music, its rust mined from anthills, rising rivers, dirty lemonade, and the brassy patches of grass in a broken southern 
    sidewalk. I just wish the soul was as fractured.</p></div>"|3534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3534-movement/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

It'll be the instrumental soundtrack to 
    everyone's collective thoughts of anger, resentment, acceptance, and then, ultimately-- after everyone's had time to reflect and make peace with whatever the hell it 
    is they're trying to reconcile at that particular moment-- it'll also be the soundtrack to great big letdown of, y'know, the world ending.  Tidal static washes will engulf the 
    land; thunderous guitar peals will split the sky.  As the Four Horseman gallop by, blasting this album at ear-splitting levels from their totally sweet sound systems, 
    everyone will brace themselves for the dénouement; folks will all be waiting for that final burst of insight to make sense out of everything, and then guess what?  
    Nothing.  It's all over, just like that.  Get your coats and go.  All that storm and stress, and for what?  Bummer, dude. At least it was exciting here and then.</p><p>
    Still, what a gyp.  For the amount of energy Mogwai spend painstakingly carving out wrenching emotional turmoil, lush interludes, and haunting Slint impressions, 
    they've had no idea where to take it since the sensory overload of 1997's <i>Young Team</i>.  More intrinsically left-brained types might have used 
    all that overpowering intensity of purpose to cure cancer, or debt, or Staind; Mogwai, on the other hand, have a languishing surplus of potential.  On their debut, 
    they did the only thing they knew how: buried the listener deep under cascading avalanches of sound, using immersion to distract them from 
    anything as trivial as a lack of direction.  Following the praise heaped on <i>Young Team</i>, though, they seem to have found an unhealthy amount of restraint; 
    subsequent albums (<i>Come On Die Young</i>, <i>Rock Action</i>) fell into a disconcerting pattern of majestic swells and faint departures.  
    Hell, <i>Rock Action</i> barely even swells.</p><p>
    \t
    Some would say they ""tightened up""; I'd say ""stiffened."" No matter how it's described, tighten something enough (any old thing, really) and common 
    sense tells you it'll break.  The good news is Mogwai may have learned that lesson just in time for <i>Happy Songs for Happy People</i>, but don't break out the 
    earplugs just yet: if <i>Rock Action</i> put you to sleep, don't rely on <i>Happy Songs...</i> to get you up in time for a morning meeting.  In many ways, this album is 
    even more reserved than past efforts; at no point does anything surpass even the mild-mannered blast of ""You Don't Know Jesus"".  The difference is that 
    much of the extraneous instrumentation that sandbagged <i>Rock Action</i> is left behind, which means the measure of the meticulous craftsmanship that was beginning 
    to hamper Mogwai is gone as well .</p><p>
    A lone organ or piano often carries the  melody through the album's quiet stretches, and the percussion is usually barely audible; for the first time, 
    Mogwai have the delicacy necessary to stir without resorting to violent upheaval, as well as the added power of a lighter touch.  It's a subtle distinction, maybe, 
    but with every album, Mogwai is more and more about the details: the organic rise and fall of ""Moses, I Amn't"" is a cathedral dirge simplified to an unprecedented 
    degree (by Mogwai's standards).  Sparsely layered organs, strings, and exceedingly sparse, hollowed-out drumstick hits rise in waves that never quite crest, for 
    once in perfect harmony with Mogwai's mournful undertones.  It bleeds quietly into ""Kids Will Be Skeletons"", which in turn transitions into the brief 
    crescendo of ""Killing All Flies""; the sweep is almost effortlessly natural.</p><p>
    The song titles should give away what the wryly ironic album title doesn't.  Surprise!-- this is a pretty goddamned grim album.  Every time I hear Mogwai, 
    I'm struck by what a miserable portrait they paint of Scotland, full of skeletonized children, dead flies and such; as usual, Mogwai's <i>Happy Music...</i> evokes 
    similar imagery.  The problem is that, in spite of much of the album's comfortable ease, the quieter tone and brooding atmosphere are burdened with even less interest in taking these songs somewhere, anywhere.  We're left lost, mired in Mogwai's omnipresent gloom.</p><p>
    Only the closing duo of ""I Know You Are, But What Am I?"" and ""Stop Coming to My House"" mercifully (and critically) avoid this.  From ""I Know You Are..."", it's a steady progression 
    through to the gradual dissolve of the final track's epic finish, offering closure (finally) with a sample of some very happy children (its emotional weight is adequately deflated 
    by the carefree kids).  I guess that's the joke, really: these so-called ""happy people"" must like uninterrupted spans of soul-crushing gloom in between rounds of 
    concentration camp footage.  Honestly, though, it's a rare, honest-to-god conclusion from these guys, and it at least punctuates the album in a clever manner if the 
    rest of the songs don't fare as well.  Mogwai still can't seem to figure out where they're going, but that problem is only extended over these tracks, as whole songs build 
    on one another.  The Stephen Kings of menacing post-rock, it seems that in absence of <i>Young Team</i>'s glorious cacophany their tremendous build-up often comes to nothing. 
    And it sounds as though they've come to terms with that.</p></div>"|5367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5367-happy-songs-for-happy-people/|7.1|Eric Carr

Sure, these days the
    Northeast has all the Industry power and all the hype-fueled products it produces, and other regions
    have their occasional heyday, but you can't front on the South-- that guy originated it all.  Every so
    often, one of the other students tries to borrow some of the South's stature by osmosis; the Midwest pulled
    it off pretty well back in the day, and that exchange student England was practically humping his leg in the
    60s &amp; 70s.  But it's the Northwest that's cultivating the strongest crush on the South today, that shy, skinny kid
    over in the corner, seeing in the South everything he's not.</p><p>
    
    The first sign of this infatuation was Doug Martsch, who released an eponymous solo album of acoustic
    beer-bottle slide ditties last year, and now the scene reports another member exhibiting symptoms of Delta
    flu.  This time around it's Sam Coomes, better known as the angry half of Quasi, who can be found doing the
    Clapton with a decathlon of blues numbers under the guise of Blues Goblins.  One can only imagine the
    further ramifications of this upper Pacific obsession: will Elliott Smith change his name to T-Bone?  Is Ben
    Gibbard's next ultra-hit collab going to be with Kenny Wayne Shepard?</p><p>
    
    Now, this situation conjures up a whole lot of racial quicksand, a topic I'd just like to tree-swing over
    Pitfall-stylee, thank you very much (da naaaa, na na!).  But I will put forth that it's not too unreasonable a claim to label
    indie rock and its sometimes-rampant EMOtions as the white blues, filled as it is with woman-done-me-wrong 
    stories punctuated by tears falling on v-necks .  And there's no denying Coomes is one of the best at this game, full of
    sing-along-able spite, with the implicit special effect that the very woman what done him wrong just
    might be the one keeping time in his band.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Blues Goblins</i> raises the question of whether Coomes is really playing to his strengths in
    concocting an all-blues cover project.  In Quasi he tends to let the lyrics lower the pH while he flicks
    them out in a cruel monotone; here he's forced to fling his voice around like a Frisbee to hit all those
    mournful blues notes.  Coomes is also best known for playing (and humping) his organ, which makes it a
    quizzical move for him to embrace a genre where success is so contingent on fret skills.</p><p>
    
    I'm no blues purist-- I'm not even much of a blues enjoyist-- but as I understand it, great blues
    overcomes the limitations and predictability of its form-letter structure through a certain kind of
    timbre, be it vocal or instrumental, that vividly expresses the musician's unique pain.  Not to question
    Coomes' life experience, but his tools just aren't up to this task.  In such unfamiliar territory, his voice
    sounds awkwardly pinched on standards like ""Black Snake Moan"" and ""Hellhound on My Trail"", not unlike
    when George Harrison turned to the blues.  Meanwhile, his guitar tone is home-recorded to a studied level of 
    grittiness, but is largely wasted on leaden noodling-- sometimes double-tracked for twice the
    ineffectiveness!-- over Skip James' ""Drunken Spree"" or his own ""Pedro's Boogie"".</p><p>
    
    These shortcomings are all reinforced by Coomes' doggedly faithful interpretations of most of these tunes,
    but even when liberties are taken, they're less than wise.  Does Charlie Patton's intimate ""Spoonful Blues""
    benefit from BOOM-BOOM drums?  Did ""Rollin and Tumblin"" really need a six-minute free-jazz saxophone
    break, by a Zappa no less?  Only ""I've Been Treated Wrong"", with its Organ of the Apocalypse breakdowns,
    finds Coomes bending the blues to his talents rather than vice versa.</p><p>
    
    Besides this outlier, Coomes sacrifices originality for reverence on his Blues Goblins project, treating
    it less as creative inspiration than as a costume-- as might be deduced by his ham-fisted choice of a
    pseudonym with the word ""Blues"" in it.  One wonders what the dividends might've been had Sam enlisted his
    ex-wife's cyborg-with-a-heart-of-gold drumming rather than his own, ahem, pancake-handed style, or if he had
    adapted the form more than emulated it.  Or maybe, like all shy, skinny kids, the Northwest, he just needs to
    be confident in his own strengths as a musician, and realize that imitating the effortless coolness of
    the South will get him nowhere.</p></div>"|824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/824-blues-goblins/|4.5|Rob Mitchum

You could get a month-long jolt of artificial energy from just one helping of their self-titled first disc, or the follow-up, <i>Utopia Parkway</i>;
    syrupy harmonies, magnetic power-pop chords and the occasional dopey keyboard riff have been the group's bread and butter since day one, and it's served them well. Long after other
    groups have lost the knack for tongue-in-cheek couplets and catchy chord progressions (what have you got to say for yourself, Rivers?), Fountains of Wayne have kept the formula close
    at hand, and served up some tasty dishes as a result.  Songwriter Adam Schlesinger wasn't tapped for the soundtrack to <i>That Thing You Do</i> for nothing, and the pop sensibilities of
    teen sensations The Wonders infuse much of FoW's latest opus, <i>Welcome Interstate Managers</i>.</p><p>
    
    As soon as the seconds start ticking and the guitar starts strumming on ""Mexican Wine"", you know what you're in for: fuzzy guitars, big Warner Bros. drums, and the gravelly voices of
    Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood, which hang out somewhere between Wayne Coyne's raspy tenor and the boat
    the British Invasion came in on. Throw in a delicate Beach Boys castanet, and you've got a killer opening
    number. Indeed, ""Mexican Wine"" is the biggest rocker on the record.  To be fair, the first single, ""Stacy's
    Mom"", aims for king of the hill, but its routine pacing keeps it from breaking away from the pack-- even if
    the crystalline harmonies during the chorus are worth noting.</p><p>
    
    As it just so happens, it's the duo's vocal harmonies that end up being the biggest boon for <i>Welcome
    Interstate Managers</i>, and no cut here makes this clearer than ""Hackensack"" (the couplet ""I saw you
    talkin'/ To Christopher Walken"" helps some), which highlights Schlesinger's 50s pop fixation while also
    encompassing jangly guitar and dreamy crooning.  And ballads like ""Valley Winter Song"" and the upbeat,
    acoustic ""Hey Julie"" might find themselves dead in the water without their clever vocal pairings-- the kind
    Fountains of Wayne have falling out their back pockets. Even when the instrumentation gets stale (""Little
    Red Light"" and the Ben Folds Five redux ""Fire Island"" are prime offenders), the creamy, chocolate-covered
    melodies are there to offer up a little redemption.</p><p>
    
    I like TastyCakes. They're sugary, they're bad for me, but I like them. I wouldn't eat a boxful of them in
    one go, though; too much of a good thing, as someone who's probably dead once said.  That's the biggest
    problem with <i>Welcome Interstate Managers</i>, and in many ways the entire Fountains of Wayne catalog. I
    don't fault the band for being disposable; on the contrary, these guys are so in love with being disposable
    that you can't help but have fun. Even if it seems unlikely that you'd ever be driving through the 'burbs
    with the windows down, singing ""Stacy's mom/ Has got it goin' on,"" I assure you it'll happen. And although
    the lyrics to ""Halley's Waitress"" are nothing less than moronic, the 70s power ballad trappings are
    straight-up masterful.</p><p>
    
    Still, Fountains of Wayne are guilty of taking themselves a bit too seriously here, or at least trying to
    prove their legitimacy, when they should be goofing around. How else to explain the peddle steel country of
    ""Hung Up on You"" which-- despite nailing the inbred cleverness of Nashville lyricism (""Ever since you hung
    up on me/ I'm hung up on you"")-- is a good example of how to fuck up a good thing, right and proper. Ditto
    the god-awful ""Peace and Love""; I really can't tell if they're making fun of hippies or giving them a big
    sloppy kiss, but the track stretches the band's magic so thin, I seriously considered starting a band just
    so I could quit in disgust.</p><p>
    
    Despite its obviously short shelf-life, <i>Welcome Interstate Managers</i> is delicious power-pop,
    unpretentious, loose and perfect for teenagers driving down to Ocean City for the weekend; Schlesinger
    and Collingwood pen some mighty fine tunes ripe and ready for sing-alongs, drawing equally on the
    lighter-than-air innocence of the 1950s and the skewed songwriting skills of Ween and They Might Be
    Giants.  Too much Fountains of Wayne will seize your stomach, but like a wide-eyed babe on Easter morning,
    you won't know you've overindulged until it's too late.</p></div>"|3160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3160-welcome-interstate-managers/|7.5|Mark Martelli

    sticks and rustling the leaves, I came across a bent hag. She whispered a few words, scattered some herbs
    to the wind, and shrunk my hands into little one-inch nubs at the end of my full-grown arms.  Helpless, and
    with nightfall hastily approaching, I stumbled across a campfire that had been built by the friendly furry
    creatures of the Animal Collective.</p><p>
    
    I could hear noises coming through the trees as I approached: They were making feral cries in the darkness,
    beginning ""Native Belle"" and startling me for just a second.  After a full day of jamborees and playing
    Indian in the woods, Avey Tare, Panda Bear, Geologist and Deaken were dancing like children around the
    crackling fire among the pines.  Their voices were twisted electronically to the point that they were
    hardly distinguishable, swirling around as though just loosed from the Ark.  I felt feeble in my attempt
    to join in, my hands cursed as they were, but the Animal Collective made me comfortable in my new body,
    showing me that even with such undersized tools-- and scarcely more than drums, voices, effect-laden
    guitars and keyboards-- infinite sounds were possible.</p><p>
    
    The moves were simple, really: I could still whoop like an injun, flapping my nubs over my mouth to bawl
    rhythmically.  Holding my hands up into my ears, all the sounds flickered like primitive wah-wah pedals
    along a cave wall.  Even with these hands, I could still clap, and did so right in the middle of the
    Gibby-tronic slurs and screams of ""Hey Light"".  The wolf-howled bursts quieted into snapping pattycakes
    and chanted rounds around the dying embers.  These communal murmurs were far removed from their first
    spastic sounds.  Panda Bear showed that by tightening my hands into balled fists, my very arms could
    become drumsticks, conveying endless energy, every surface a percussive experiment.  Even as I tap out
    this recollection, they clack against the keys rhythmically, moving with the rounds of distorted campfire
    singing; not as a regular beat, but as something stumbled upon and followed into the wild.</p><p>
    
    The thinly veiled vocal menace of Sonic Youth's <i>Bad Moon Rising</i> is laid out on ""Infant Dressing
    Table"" with much clanking, wailing and gurgled regurgitation.  Seemingly innocent as a newborn babe, ""Two
    Sails on a Sound"" mutates the dark forest into the wood panels of Whitley Strieber's downstairs den,
    suggesting the presence of silvery aliens.  As a piano sampled from <i>Cluster II</i> plinks out ""The
    Battle Hymn of the Republic"", the twelve-minute abduction transcends glory-glory hallelujah altogether.
    ""Slippi"" is a lost Missa Luba ritual disguised as basement hardcore, an ecclesiastical outburst of joyfully
    chanted heart patters.  ""Too Soon"" creaks as near to the ground as cricket tremors, interrupted by the
    shrapnel of the exploding frogs that fall from the trees.  Our hands also tremble with inevitable release.
    It is a natural death for such forest-dwelling creatures as us, slowly losing hold, rising and falling.</p><p>
    
    The odd pop traces from Avey Tare and Panda Bear's much-beloved <i>Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've
    Vanished</i> have become discernable at certain moments on this day, but only echoed distantly in the
    woods, not so much lost as Gone.  The music was stripped down to that ecstatic skin of mouth, hands, and
    feet, invoking a rhythmic rapture I had previously only associated with Boredoms and certain tribal
    recordings.  While it's hard to grasp exactly what the Animal Collective was up to here that day in the
    forest, I have fumbled for hours tonight with my withered paws to gain some kind of understanding, and
    to hope for just one more glimpse of the ghosts with whom I was so sure I'd danced.</p></div>"|190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/190-here-comes-the-indian/|8.6|Andy Beta

Partially, I think it was a concession they made in casting-- they chose
    folks who could project their voices, dance and act; looking for that triumverate of talent, it mattered not whether they were Sarah Brightman belting out that vibrato like the unfurling
    petals of a glorious rose.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, the voices on <i>A Chorus Line</i> were conversational. They had the advantage of sounding like real people conveying elements of their lives-- which is exactly what
    they were, in the context of the script. Wayne Cilento singing ""I Can Do That"" has all the requisite wackiness of a brassy jokester swindling his way into tap class; Priscilla Lopez's
    version of ""Nothing"" captured desire and revenge through the very viable channel prayer; both resonate with the banal reality of your neighbors grousing over what sweet morsel to
    throw on the BBQ next, only in song form. No spectacular warbles to phone home about, but somehow real in a way that Andrew Lloyd Webber's minions will never
    understand-- a sort of folk art, really.</p><p>
    
    Azita's <i>Endantiodromia</i> works in the same way-- terrible, compelling and somehow real all at once. Terrible comes first, and I mean it in the literary sense: formidable, extreme, bloody,
    larger-than-life. Terrible as in ""Ivan, the."" With the assistance of drummer John McEntire, bassist Matthew Lux, guitarist Jeff Parker, and cornetist Rob Mazurek, Azita plays armchair pub jazz in
    70s half-step melodies, composing jittery modernist piano pieces for the pop age. Her singing voice, petted down quite a lot from her war-cry days in Chicago no-punk greats the Scissor
    Girls and Bride of Nono, is a flimsy, moppety, rubbery alto that never knows which note is safe to pitch a tent upon. Initially, it is something akin to off-putting-- or if you're feeling sinister,
    off-putting could also be interpreted as ""intolerable.""</p><p>
    
    However. Once the fertile terribleness of Azita's painfully unaffected delivery sinks in, it lays eggs, and <i>Endantiodromia</i> reveals itself as one of those records that shears the tiny line
    between genius and utterly confounding. She interprets her compositions like Linda Ronstadt's record with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, if Linda had first washed down a couple
    valium pills with a flask of Maker's Mark. Or, like Yoko Ono fronting Get Hustle. Or, on the vocal-free numbers, like Gyorgy Kurtag's jagged, frightening vocal explorations and
    Scriabin piano concertos interpreted in a pop-jazz context.</p><p>
    
    Azita interprets the aforementioned ideas-- along with a whole heaping spoonful of Steely Dan cocaine-haze melodics-- as if seeing them through a warped mirror bubbled up and cracked with
    globules of heat. And, as conversation goes, Azita's is appropriately deranged, as she barks out lyrics like, ""I'd love to invite your eleventh finger in for a little tickle"" on the slinky, cabaret number
    ""Ooh Ooh Johnny"". On the opening track, ""Better End in Time"", Azita's narrative gets anecdotal: ""We split up after the Christmas party/ He was too far gone to care/ Pukin' out the driver side door/
    Maneuvering the stairs/ Claiming his is the art of a sailor/ A little take from everywhere."" She sings it in a whimper and, more important than the fact that her throat is clogged and froggy,
    she is utterly believable. She's believable 'cause she's flawlessly human and unscripted, like her vocal tracks were cut in one take, the second she thought of them. Unfettered.</p><p>
    
    And with that realization, something weird happens. The more I listen to <i>Enantiodromia</i>, the more I believe it to be a work erring more on the side of genius than on the side of
    confounding. Her piano compositions are quite impeccable (see Scriabin vs. piano jazz reference above), her voice is inimitable (without the slightest ounce of hyperbole, that one),
    and the album's final track, ""Show Theme"", left room for some subdued Fosse-style choreography after I threw back my Sunday mimosa.</p></div>"|396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/396-enantiodromia/|8.5|Julianne Shepherd

    took off in the UK, people suspected they could do many things. They could be the next Basement Jaxx, wrapping house music around a dozen genres-- rock, hip-hop, R&amp;B;, UK garage-- cranking 
    out purified pop from their blender. They could be the next Streets, packing up a street-level vision of Brit boylife and mailing it out on bumping beats. They could christen a new genre-- ""hooligan 
    house?""</p><p>
    
    All of this was just the usual exaggeration from getting very, very excited, but no one was out of line: ""We Don't Care"" sounds like a couple guys in gorilla suits taking house 
    hostage. It starts with solo vocals, Simon Franks barking marble-mouthed like the Clash; then, before the house stomp comes in-- a big knuckle-dragging bruiser of a stomp, a beat 
    that bounces in a way hardly anything but American hip-hop ever does-- the whole thing stops for the highlight, the barely-intelligible sneer: ""WHATHAFAA!"" I have notes on this track in front 
    me, and after a bunch of stuff about hooliganism and the jaunty mid-song breakdown I have written: ""Oh my god. Oh man.""</p><p>
<i>Ego War</i> sports a few singles this good or arguably better, and in each case it's down to two things: fantastic ideas and consistently great scripting by beat-dresser Tom Dinsdale. 
    His music isn't exactly symphonic, but it's good-looking and inventive: constantly punchy, rough-and-tumble, sneakily switched-up house beats like overexcited puppies tripping over their own 
    legs as they sprint over to lick you silly.</p><p>
    
    Not to point fingers, but the problems lurk more in Franks's domain: if Americans already have problems with British people doing anything rap-like, Franks's occasional bouts of troglodytic 
    rhyming aren't going to help matters. This doesn't have to kill things any more than punk singers killed punk-- in at least two places, it sort of helps-- but I have to mention the line, ""About a year I was 
    with her for/ and when we broke it left me quite sore."" It's another reason to feel bad for them, actually, because that clunker comes in a year when UK garage MCs have started 
    looking even better than their hip-hop equivalents-- even Jay-Z's paying attention, and sometime soon, he'll see the release of a full-length from Dizzee Rascal, whose basement rant ""I Luv U"" 
    walks all over ""We Don't Care"". As for Franks, well...you're better off if you don't exactly need your pop stars to sound like scholars.</p><p>
    
    Some winners: the title track, for which my notes go a step further and say ""holy god."" You could dance to this super-sunny island bounce, but not without sporting a loopy grin at the situation, 
    or at its intense Englishness: it's Madness; it's like the parks of <i>Parklife</i> got paved to put up discos. Or ""The Snow"": Dinsdale's got a thing for punchy seventies horn sections, and this, 
    their best house track, EQs them through dime-stop switchbacks while Franks lazes around the repeating melody.  Or ""I Go to Your House"",  which struts and bumps like Stereo MCs and points 
    the hey-there gun-fingers at you. This is one of those places where Franks's tossed-off babble enhances things: he goes to her house and she's not there, but it sounds like he really thinks that's 
    her loss.</p><p>
     
    When your M.O. is just a banged-up house pump and a less-than-stellar singer coasting over a few melody lines, anything less than the best has a tendency to grate: like the riff-repetition 
    of the average Fall record, the winners win and the rest just sit there looking underplanned. It's the Day in the Life packaging that fails them more often: on The Streets' <i>Original Pirate 
    Material</i>, Mike Skinner put on just the right two-face-- a garrulous wit one second, he'd go all emo-earnest on you the next, sounding sad, determined, and vulnerable. Franks tries the same, 
    with less success-- on ""100 Million"" he sits around stoned while his mother yells at him to get a job, and ""Way Too Long"" offers a Skinnerian tale of bad debts among the geezers, but by ""The 
    Things"" and ""Veteran"" he's promising to change his life and ""be a better man."" In between you get Dinsdale playing with the beats a little: video-game tick-tock and synth-tweakery on ""Real Life"", then 
    a weirdo Halloween toy-robot bass-bump on ""The Tyson Shuffle""; Joe Cocker samples alternate with music-hall piano on ""Face in a Cloud"".</p><p>
    
    They don't need to be ""great,"" really, because sometimes it's more important to get everything right; to be honest is often to be honestly great.  And they are, In the rough crayon 
    sketches of everything collapsing, of dance music being pop music being dance music again, of anyone singing and rapping the way anyone could shout for punk bands, of 
    everything pumpable or shoutable or loveable collapsing into a hit-single playground. Still, crayon sketches: they're no Basement Jaxx, and it's easy to hope for someone with more 
    professional skills to come fill in the Audio Bullys' blueprints.</p></div>"|354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/354-ego-war/|7.4|Nitsuh Abebe

Their debut album, <i>The King Beneath the     Mountain</i>, laid out a band mythology of an insect kingdom called Eceon     where, if I understand correctly, I am a moth person (that would explain     the attraction to bright lights) in some sort of bent narrative involving     grasshopper royalty. Fortunately, on the surface of this place Eceon, as     indicated on the sleeve, ""time and energy are blurred into a beautiful     landscape of sound,"" which is definitely an idea I can get with.  The     story of the album is told instrumentally for the most part, through     dreamy sheets of feedback and gurgling drones, so even though I parted     ways with fantasy literature 20 years ago, I can follow.</p>
<p>The band's second album is <i>Dragyn</i> (as in, ""dragon""), and it continues     the tale, I guess. This time, there's actually a short prose narrative on the     inside of the record dealing with Tussyans and Sephryns and assorted other     Magic starter-deck rejects. I haven't read the story yet, and I doubt I ever     will, but it's there if you're wondering what happens next. The extent of my     interest in all this is that place where ""time and energy blur,"" so I'm     going to talk about the sound.</p>
<p>Though it definitely sounds like the same band as last time around, the feel     of <i>Dragyn</i> is considerably different-- darker, spacier, more abstract.     <i>Dragyn</i> was apparently assembled Can-style from recordings of extensive     band improvisation; when walking the improv wire, Surface of Eceyon has a tense     and restless vibe. There are no vocals this time, and the warmth of a song like     the debut's ""The Open Sea"" is missed. What <i>Dragyn</i> delivers best is some     effective passages of atmosphere, where three and four instruments combine     seamlessly into pulsing whole.</p>
<p>""Council Is Called"" is a nice example of the band working together to lock     into a mood rather than a groove. The track is built on a keyboard drone,     around which several guitars spin synchronous webs of sound, the echoing     series of notes playing off each other, accented by the occasional cymbal     wash. It reminds me a bit of Spacemen 3's <i>Recurring</i> in the way simple     guitar tones and space do a huge amount of emotional work. ""Victory of Ice     and Magyk"" is much more acidic, with distantly wah-wahing rhythm guitars from     the early fusion school playing off an overdriven lead that imparts an edge     of fried psychedelia. Both are engaging and reward careful listening.</p>
<p>Owing to their improvisatory origins, many tracks fade in and out almost     randomly, and sometimes the abrupt transitions are jarring. But when they     leave the scissors in the drawer, as on the 19-minute closer ""Freeing the     Winds"", you understand why they edit: it's a track with a few great moments     and a number of dull ones. This patchy, haphazard character puts <i>Dragyn</i> a notch below the band's debut. Sometimes, you feel like you're listening to     a solid practice jam rather than a recording to return to frequently.</p>
<p>""Over Land and Ice"" is <i>Dragyn</i> at its best. It fades up gradually, but     rather than seeming like an edit from a longer session, the song feels like     the musical equivalent of a Polaroid photograph developing before your     eyes. The ringing guitar pattern dominating the song's first section is     pretty much pure joy translated into six strings, and the gauzy coziness of     the accompanying rhythm part reminds me of when Duster used to get the     guitar tone just right. Even as these connections unravel over the tune's 11     minutes (this is a six-track, hour-long record), ""Over Land and Ice"" retains     its uplifting feel. As long as the band's collective jams occasionally lead     somewhere this satisfying, I'll put up with the fire-breathing mushrooms.</p></div>"|7636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7636-dragyn/|6.8|Mark Richardson

Over the past decade (yes, the band is older than your cousin in the 3rd grade),
    they've managed to practically redefine hardcore punk while never really breaking free from their own self-created sound universe.  The staggering
    consistency displayed in their run of releases is unmatched, even among their more intense countrymen Boredoms and Ruins.  Some people say all their
    songs sound the same, and while I'm hardly willing to go that far, I will say that if intense tech-punk isn't your thing, you can safely avoid all of
    their records.  The discerning listener will recognize small deviations in the formula over the years: gradual integration of electronics and post-rock
    production, longer songs, occasionally slower tempos.  However, Yasuko O's voice is still way up in the stratosphere, Agata's guitar is still running
    laps around Eddie Van Halen's worst nightmares, and Melt Banana, for better or for worse, occupy the same place in the hearts of indie and experimental
    listeners everywhere as they have throughout their existence.</p><p>
    The question is, do you still want to hear them turn out another record?  Seeing them live is one thing, as like clockwork, every year they blow
    whomever might be sharing the bill with them off the stage.  However, conventional wisdom (certainly not always to be trusted) says that one only
    needs so many Melt Banana discs.  In this case, I'd say conventional wisdom had a very good point - but it doesn't account for everything.  Like <i>Teeny
    Shiny</i> and <i>Charlie</i> before, <i>Cell-Scape</i> improves on just enough to be interesting for anyone curious, and probably another must-have for fanatics.  I fall somewhere in between, and thus can recommend it with only the slightest caveat that if you hated the band before, it's not likely to
    change your mind.</p><p>
    That said, there is quite a bit here to preach to the converted: impossibly speedy workouts like ""Key is A Fact That A Cat Brings"" and ""Like A White Bat
    in A Box, Dead Matters Go On"" remind me that there is no better band on the planet at ramming a punk jam down my throat.  Additionally, it should be
    obvious that Melt Banana possess the best song titles in the business, and along with them, some of the coolest, sprawling poetic lyrics. ""Shield For
    Your Eyes, A Beast in the Well on Your Hand"" busts out of the gate with an almost nu-metal sense of pounding and over-engorged mix.  Agata plays a
    nifty, surprisingly straightforward riff over Rika Mm's perpetually motive bassline.  Yes, the lightspeed acrobatics return at the mid-section, but the
    new wrinkles are what distinguish <i>Cell-Scape</i> from its immediate predecessors.</p><p>
    The most obviously new sounds occur on the one-two jab ""If it is the Deep Sea, I Can See You There"" and ""Outro for Cell-Scape"" that ends the album.
    The former tune begins as pro-forma MB speed etude, but just as suddenly transforms itself into an almost poppy piece of indie rock, with Yasuko
    defying all odds by actually singing!  It's a very interesting move on their part, and perhaps foreshadows future strategies.  Then again, the extended
    electro-ambience of ""Outro"" suggests that they'd rather be psyching it up with Yamatsuka Eye.  It's actually a little reminiscent of the last track on
    Charlie wherein the preceding boisterous half hour was made null and void by a thick wall of impressionistic goo.  Again, an interesting move, and one of
    the reasons I have no problem recommending the disc.</p><p>
    I've hoped for a while that Melt Banana would drop their masterpiece, their grand statement to consolidate their power into a tightly wound critical
    mass.  I see a few more people show up every time they come through town, and now is as good a time as any for them to really take off beyond the
    realms of fringe noise bands.  Alas, though hardly a misstep, <i>Cell-Scape</i> is not that masterpiece.  Nevertheless, I'm as tuned in as I ever was to their
    next move.</p></div>"|5218.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5218-cell-scape/|7.5|Dominique Leone

That might be the most striking distinction between this
    compilation and 1978's historic No Wave warning shot, the famed, Brian Eno-produced <i>No New York</i>
    comp referred to by the title of this proposed modern counterpart.  In 1978, James Chance and his
    contemporaries were making albums retailers couldn't move with a forklift, and now The Strokes probably
    have more platinum-certified albums than all the NYC No Wavers combined (which is to say, they have one).
    Teenage Jesus &amp; The Jerks made music unlike anyone in rock and roll had before them-- or ever wanted to,
    perhaps-- but now we just seem to kill time between revivals.  That's how it feels sometimes, hearing
    every new band discussed in reference to their ancestors; The Fever is to PIL as Ted Leo is to Thin Lizzy,
    ad infinitum.</p><p>
    
    It's hard not to succumb to crotchety lamentations on the State of the Music Industry when an album-- a
    compilation, at that-- owes such an obvious debt to the past; as a music critic, I realize we're the ones
    responsible for most of the finger-pointing in the first place, but there's hope to be found at the bottom
    of all this.  Even though <i>Yes New York</i> lacks the out-of-nowhere significance of its namesake, it's
    got a few major selling points.  First, it's for a good cause: the proceeds will benefit Musicians on Call, a
    charity devoted to exploring the recuperative powers of music by bringing it to hospital patients.  Second,
    if everyone would quit playing connect-the-dots to pin down who these bands copped their sounds from, you
    might be able to hear this album for what it is: a brilliant cross-section of a thriving quasi-local music
    scene.</p><p>
    
    Fittingly, it opens with a live version of ""New York City Cops"" by the band who, along with a cataclysmic
    shifting of the city's Feng Shui, is most responsible for the recent wealth of attention being lavished on
    the NYC scene.  The track was cut from the U.S. version of The Strokes' debut, <i>Is This It</i>, in a
    kneejerk post-9/11 pique, for its sweetly disparaging chorus of, ""New York City cops/ They ain't too
    sma-art,"" though I still can't fathom what anyone could hear in this song to warrant censure.  Sure, there's
    a literal dig at New York's boys in blue, and it's basically a tale of heroin addiction, but in every wailing
    guitar strain, in each of Julian Casablancas' glassy-eyed lines, I hear pure love. All of these songs are
    just a fraction of the emotion to be found on the faces of the millions walking the downtown streets of New
    York-- the redemptive hope of Interpol's ""NYC"", the world-is-against-me determination of Ted Leo's ""Ballad
    of the Sin Eater""-- but ""New York City Cops"" is an honest expression of hometown pride.</p><p>
    
    Yeah, I could be reading into it too much, but this comp is New York through and through, and I can't think
    of a better way to open things up.  Following the champions are a half-dozen of the big name acts you'd
    expect on an early-naughts NYC compilation: Radio 4 contribute one of their most uncharacteristically
    innovative and powerful tracks, the impossibly urgent ""Save Your City""; DFA's other dance-punk superstars,
    The Rapture, chime in with the synthesized desperation of ""Olio"".  From the fragile tranquility of The
    Walkmen's ""Rue the Day"" to Calla's slightly sinister ""Strangler"", this comp makes one thing perfectly clear:
    for a host of bands so readily compared to the same tiny stable of influences-- ""sounding like a modern-day
    Gang of Four...""-- there sure is a hell of a lot of diversity between them.</p><p>
    
    An equally impressive feat: most of the bands not yet blessed with truckloads of publicity hang in for all
    sixteen rounds, without once showing signs of fatigue.  The Witnesses manage a surprisingly entertaining
    take on blues-rock care of AC/DC; the arena vibe might get old after a whole album, but ""I Should Not Have
    to Ask"" is the perfect antidote to the mopey miserablism that cuts a broad swathe through the middle of the
    compilation.  The Natural History, meanwhile, pull off a groovy, Anglican amalgam of American roots and
    classic Britpop with ""The Right Hand"" in a moment of clutch late-album respite.</p><p>
    
    DFA's performance alter-egos LCD Soundsystem contribute some Zep-informed 70s stomp-rock mayhem with ""Tired"",
    and there's even some band called Unitard doing a subtly countrified, boring take on the Yeah Yeah Y-- hey,
    wait a second, it's <i>actually the Yeah Yeah Yeahs</i>, they almost had me fooled!  And here I thought they
    skipped out on <i>Yes New York</i> like their no-account friends in Liars.   The YYY's pull out a less
    impressive ""unplugged"" version of ""Our Time"" billed as ""Year to be Hated""; it's one of their weaker moments
    as a band, but it's uncommonly sincere, and an appropriate, fine closer to a schizophrenic thrill-ride of a
    compilation.</p><p>
    
    There are a few other less-than-stellar entries-- particularly Longwave's achingly ordinary acoustic
    gentleness-- but this is a portrait of a city's music community in total, and as such is really impressive.
    Though every song might not be spectacular, an accurate portrait isn't just a matter of putting on a shiny,
    happy public face, but rather showing the scene from all angles, for better or ""eh.""  <i>Yes New York</i>
    manages to corral a number of shooting stars you might expect to fall into ego traps, and countering the
    cool sheen displayed in hype-building articles, their participation in this benefit-- for such a simple
    charity-- is a commendable contribution to the city they call home.</p></div>"|2013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2013-yes-new-york/|8.0|Eric Carr

    Even the understated kitsch value of a dwarf-- costumed as the sorcerer's apprentice-- ""giving it"" to a fully developed magic broom was lost without the possibility of grandma, 
    shawl-covered and napping in the basement, haphazardly overhearing lines like ""FUCK ME HARDER, MERLIN!""  With an entire two-bedroom, two-bath at my disposal, the guilt 
    of owning such a collection of magazines and videotapes was gone, unfortunately taking with it the excitement of viewing those naughty images of girl-on-girl, hardcore, and the 
    dubious ""miscellaneous.""</p><p>
    
    Trevor Montgomery-- formerly of Tarentel and The Drift-- is familiar with a similar thrill of fermented voyeurism, as his intimate tales of love and death are likewise garnished by a compelling 
    sense of discomfort and guilt.  Appropriately made within the confines of his bedroom, <i>Songs for an Unborn Sun</i>-- created under the pseudonym Lazarus-- is a revealing look into the 
    inner-thoughts and fears of this songwriter.  Augmented by the poetically macabre sensation that you're participating in an ill-advised act of personal and public shame, <i>Songs...</i> thrives 
    insofar as it doesn't simply function as a detached ""tear-in-my-beer"" tale of woe, but actively engages the listener in his throes of melancholy torment, regardless of their consent.</p><p>
    
    Crucial to the album's unsettling success is the production of Marty Anderson (Howard Hello, Dilute); he supplies the sparse accompaniment that shades the sincerity in Montgomery's 
    doleful voice.  On ""Wind"", Anderson layers his own crone-like, tar-filled growl in harmony with Montgomery's soft yet weighty instrument, as they bludgeon your ears with their lamenting 
    call of ""I am my mother, I am the wind/ We are lost without each other"" before fading gently into the track's namesake.  In the same way, ""The Song Becomes Blood"" and ""Born a Friendship"" 
    share Anderson's accent: he weaves himself in and out of tune, arising mainly to highlight lyrical buzzwords like ""suicide"" and ""choking.""</p><p>
    
    The root strength of ""Poets the Liars"" is found within the bleak contrast between strumming acoustic guitar and distant swells of ambient noise, and proves exemplar of the homely 
    yet enjoyable nature of the entire album.  As chimes flutter and ornament the bare backbone of what constitutes a melody, you're driven to bear witness to the track as it unfurls, 
    the same way you can't turn your head from the sight of a bloodied animal on the roadside.  ""Tears"", ""Obviust"", and ""Time"" develop this musical conceit further, complicating the 
    instrumentation with cello, organ, and piano, which nicely augment these otherwise nude compositions.</p><p>
    
    Ironically, the relatively upbeat moments of the album detract most from the overall work.  ""Ocean (Burn the Highways)"" feels sentimentally and musically flat trailing behind 
    the rich ""Poets"", not aided in the least by the addition of sappy, surging strings and an invitation to ""drift to sleep.""  Sounding like the forced caterwaul of a dying relationship that neither 
    party is willing to acknowledge, ""Boredom Revolt"" further adds to the chagrin as Montgomery ceases to flex his elegiac power, choosing the path most-taken with his floundering 
    plea to go ""Back to sleep, to work, and to dreaming.""</p><p>
    
    The vaguely lewd liner notes-- sporting unpleasant line drawings of couples in various stages of arousal-- give the final clue to unlocking the charm and buried beauty of this album.  
    Designed for headphone-enveloped solitude, <i>Songs for an Unborn Sun</i> invokes the dirty-yet-satisfying feelings associated with improper actions, wanton consequences, 
    and various other culpable pleasures.  It's telling that Montgomery's only true failure in the project comes in the few moments where he shrouds his work with elements of 
    guiltless indulgence, robbing the listener of artistic intimacy and reducing <i>Songs...</i> from a powerful statement on morose coition to a less enticing, brief flirtation with 
    the obscene.</p></div>"|4701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4701-songs-for-an-unborn-sun/|7.6|Andrew Bryant

    its Baudelaire. For a while, it seemed like the Scot might get the job: his bon mots are sufficiently toxic,
    his imagery runs to rococo decadence, and best of all, he walks the walk: Currie's biography is a steady
    succession of scandals. A quick recap would include his marriage to a 17-year-old Bangladeshi girl-- which
    had British tabloids occupied for a good part of 1994-- and a lost lawsuit over a song about Wendy Carlos.
    The financial fallout of the latter had Momus soliciting wealthy fans for old-fashioned patronage (he sold
    them ""song portraits"" at $1000 a pop) and generally upping productivity-- the fleurs of which we are picking
    to this day. <i>Oskar Tennis Champion</i>, his unlistenable new album, suggests the launch of a different
    fund drive: Pay Momus to Zip It.</p><p>
    Written and recorded in Japan (where Momus is fairly well established-- he wrote a hit called ""I Am a Kitten""
    for pop star Kahimi Karie), the CD takes no inspiration from its surroundings, other than an unpleasant
    ambient intro titled ""Spooky Kabuki"", which finds Currie croaking ""we are the pirates"" over clicks, burbles
    and sine waves. The album's production adds a superfluous glitch layer to Momus's usual Casio sea shanties,
    and the results are somewhat reminiscent of Future Bible Heroes' ""Eternal Youth"", the vampires-and-aliens opus
    that arguably marks Stephin Merritt's lowest moment to date. But to compare the two would be to ascribe
    <i>Oskar Tennis Champion</i> a degree of coherence, and I'm not that generous.</p><p>
    Song after song, Currie's trademarked sick wit is nowhere to be found. ""My Sperm Is Not Your Enemy"" is a
    vintage Momus title, but it's hung on a predictable and humorless ditty; the same goes for ""Beowulf (I Am
    Deformed)"", and whatever hilarity could be gleaned from ""Electrosexual Sawing Machine"" comes from the posh
    way Momus pronounces ""seks-you-al.""</p><p>
    Hope is momentarily rekindled with the arrival of ""The Last Communist"", an energetic number with an actual
    melody, rather than a half-assed waltz or polka pastiche.  Alas, the song is quickly exposed as a third-rate
    Auteurs ripoff, the kind Luke Haines probably writes in his uneasy absinthe sleep. The lyrics are an
    embarrassing laundry list of lame Russki clichés (""Drinking vodka through a straw/ Looking for the visions
    Lenin saw""), which is more than a disappointment from the guy who wrote ""Trans-Siberian Express""-- a cruel,
    precise, and terrific poem that deserves a place in any number of modern literary anthologies.</p><p>
    That was old Momus, I guess, unencumbered by tabloid infamy and money concerns. The new Momus is the kind of
    guy who stoops to include a minute of silence as the 16th track on this disc and titles it ""A Minute of
    Silence"". If that's not enough, he follows it up with an instrumental reprise of the album's second track--
    rendered in telephone ringtones! Oh, the fun!</p><p>
    Awful as it might be, <i>Oskar</i> is not easy to dismiss because awfulness has always been a part of Momus'
    gambit. The man's main fallacy, however, is that his laboriously cultivated image of a postmodern ponce is
    binding and irreversible. Behind the moniker of the Greek God of Ridicule, Nick Currie is an erudite man
    who consigned himself to powdered-wig naughtiness and endless intimations of buggery. This kind of stuff
    gets old-- even for the joker-- and there's nothing to kill a comedy routine like a whiff of <i>noblesse
    oblige</i>.</p></div>"|5385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5385-oskar-tennis-champion/|2.1|Michael Idov

    box containing a rusted lounge chair. It's nigh impossible to avoid associating this band with Will ""Bonnie-Prince-Palace-Push-Songs-Music-Brothers"" Oldham:
    Ned shares plenty of his wily sibling's vocal tics and virtues-- a mumbly Kentucky brogue, a cocky but worried tone, a subdued wail-- and Will usually guests on Ned's
    recordings (The Anomoanon have conversely acted as Will's backing and touring band, sharing peripheral personnel in Dave Heumann, Pooh Johnston, and Paul Oldham).  Both
    acts cover obscurish poetry, and are puckish with syntax and grammar.  Lyrically, they love to tiptoe in tulips alternately soothing and disturbing.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Asleep Many Years In The Wood</i> continues to define Ned's own dominion: he is not his brother's stevedore, he's the autopiloting captain of some weird tractor-boat, a hoverharvester
    that would replace the locals' fear of twisters (if Kentucky had everglades). Whereas Will has anachronistic magnetism and an under-the-bridge creepiness, Ned cuts a traditionally attractive
    and welcoming figure; he is Abel to his brother's Cain, or Arnold Schwarzenegger to Will's Danny DeVito.</p><p>
    
    Another Anomo-myth is that ""they sound like the Grateful Dead."" Leave that noise to the misguided folks with dancing-bear ankle-tats, the ones who say ""whoa, that's Jerry, brah"" whenever
    the professor shows a slide of Karl Marx or Michelangelo's God (or Papa Smurf). Ned's otherworldly wharf-folk does not ""jam,"" nor does it indulge in that subset of psychedelia's time-honored
    (and time-consuming) bottom-scrapery. Disclaimer the Last: while even the most ornate ""alt-country"" records can suffer from sameyness, anyone who calls the Anomoanon's work
    conventional is only half-listening.</p><p>
    
    You have to wonder if the band took the mobile recording unit from Shelbyville's Rove Studios to coastal Onancock, Virginia in order to safeguard the marina-vibe they've cultivated since
    1999's <i>Summer Never Ends</i> EP, or just for the place's perverse name, because Ned appears to enjoy simultaneous fulfillment and inversion of expectations. His slow jams always prefer
    realism to romance;  ""One That Got Away"" (a gaw-geous duet with Will that, though it might be about a dead lover, couldn't resist the cornball fishing-joke title) begins, ""Baby/ I don't think
    about you all the time."" The album is packed with uncanny lines: ""You gave away all of your eyes,"" ""If I understood everything you're saying, I would be you,""  or check this out: ""Friends like
    us, we need some enemies.""</p><p>
    
    During the slippery, mystical ""Sixteen Ways,"" the band debuts the newest clan member, baby Sam Oldham, crying, in a gesture much less maudlin than
    ""Sail To The Moon""-- Radiohead's new homage to Lennon's egoey, procreation-praising ""Beautiful Boy"".  Not all the verbiage contained here is keepworthy, though: Ned commits a dopey
    rhyme crime (""sad guy"" and ""bad guy"") and I hope he's quoting an Alzheimer's-compromised Mr. Belvedere when he sings, ""Sometimes dreams make me happy/ Sometimes they give
    me the worst kind of fright."" Derrr, flowers is pretty to smell at. Run quick from scary bears.</p><p>
    
    The whole project is ruled by ""Kick Back"", a Fogertized cowbell stomp with a dash of Allmania, tempered by its Dylan-worshiping Jennyanykind neu-boogie. During the breakdown,
    you hear a cough, then a mutter of ""kickin' back,"" then a bonkers Vietnam-paranoid scream, ""KICKIN' BACK!"" The moment's incongruity provides a great upsurge, like when Frankie
    shouted for us to relax, or when Ian demanded we dance (three times) to the radio. Fun is your imperative! Chill the fuck out right now or I'll snap! The song lifts the listener beyond any
    suspicion that the Anomoanon operates out of a Nepot Depot, beyond the horror of termites choosing your house every swarm-season, beyond your exercise bulimia, and beyond how
    you had to pull a Schopenhauer and shove your cynical RoboMaid Maria down the stairs for asking if you were listening to the Spin Doctors.</p><p>
    
    The title track is a full-on cattle-driver. Even the artwork (a liquor bottle boasting the album name; a picture of a rotting pig--""old ham,"" get it?) is a treat. Thank you, Ned, Jack, Willy,
    Aram, and Jason; you blokes know when to pepper up an otherwise unsurprising (and creatively extinct) genre with some viola and tubular bells, and your lyrics can make the mockery
    I receive for flying your muddy flag in this era of laptopclashtronelectrica worthwhile. Just tonight, when I asked Rob Mitchum about that new Console, he said, ""But I thought you only
    listened to music made by melancholy people with big beards."" That was cold, city boy. How dare you disparage the militia-standoff optimism of us bindle-carrying,
    moonshine-jug-brandishing idiots.</p></div>"|201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/201-asleep-many-years-in-the-wood/|7.9|William Bowers

Brite and a frequent locale of the <i>Girls Gone Wild</i> video series-- is infamous for its
    muggy, beaded sleaziness, as well as a shitload of haunted locales. It's also the sweaty workshop of Mr. Quintron, the scattered 9th ward inventor of
    the Drum Buddy (a rotating, percussive oscillator activated by rhythmic light exposure patterns) and the fertile mind behind a finely tweaked
    circus-cum-porn rhinestone universe.</p><p>
    
    Born in Germany, Q came of age in Mobile, Alabama and St. Louis, Missouri. Combing electronic know-how and sonic flair, he headed to Chicago when he
    was 17, where he hooked up with Bulb records, who up to this point released most of his material.  Quintron relocated to New Orleans in 1991, and during
    a bit of Mardi Gras magic, met his wife Miss Pussycat, a renowned puppeteer and proprietor of the now defunct theater space Pussycat Gardens. They've been
    working together on music, sexy costumes, musical gadgets, infomercials, and over-the-top live shows ever since.  Checking those grubby fingernails
    reachin' out for Miss Pussycat's pink air-brushed shirt on the cover of <i>Are You Ready for an Organ Solo?</i>, you can see they're collaboratin' on
    this freaky-ass love-in as well.</p><p>
    
    My first run-in with Quintron was his second record, the vinyl-only <i>Amazing Spellcaster</i> (its shiny, silver-and-red swirl packaging leaked and smeared onto my
    hands when I first bought it). Recorded live at the Pussycat Caverns, it was a seriously haunted organ stomp of bottles, birds, and a Disco Light
    Machine. During this early period, Quintron's tunes were more gleefully exploratory and repetitious. I remember imagining this goggled smoke and mirror man
    living in a Victorian-styled cave, reading lots of Harry Partch.</p><p>
    
    I miss that arcane shit. Q's lately been surrounded by an army of guest vocalists and some honest-to-god pop star hooks-- and he recorded this album with
    Tim Kerr, so things are even more layered and finessed.  Despite the added production value, Quintron still handles the bulk of instrumental duties (Miss
    Pussycat plays maracas and a second drum), continuing with his one-man-band approach.  But in the studio, that's hardly discernable: assembled track
    by track, it sounds like any other band. I don't mind cohesion, but I'm a bit nervous about the dance-oriented cheerleader change of pace here-- imagine a less
    irritating Peaches.</p><p>
    
    ""Underwater Dance Club"" is a worrisome nod to the B52's, and when the record gets harsher, as on ""Cave Formation"", Quintron only approaches the detached
    pounding of Chicks On Speed. ""Miniature Breakdown"" is even more electroclash familiar, but does ushers in moments of a Terry Riley <i>You're No Good</i> vibe,
    which carries through to the next track, ""I'm Not Busy"". ""Teenage Antoinette"" and ""Place Unknown"" more successfully combine these new strains with his keyboard-driven
    sound, both exciting examples of his progression.</p><p>
    
    You could righteously label most of these tracks soulful workouts, but the closer ""Organ Solo""-- a twisted laser tag waltz-- serves as a contradiction to
    the entire album, evoking Quintron's more ecstatic early years.  I'm not a nostalgic man, I just know what works, and this reminder of how much
    better it used to be exposes the shakiness of his new ideas.  While not his strongest or most compelling work, <i>Are You Ready for an Organ Solo?</i>
    does have some of that old-age chutzpah shaken with its new school ingredients, offering a sometimes swank interlude to Quintron's dirty hotels
    and kitschy backwaters.</p></div>"|6599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6599-are-you-ready-for-an-organ-solo/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

It reads: ""And
    Justice for All.""  There, in the country's northernmost town, pinched by Lebanon, and set in a valley as
    arid and colorless as an Anton Corbijn photo, my brothers and I assembled compact discs for Elektra Records,
    far from the reach of cable modems and CDRWs.</p><p>
    After long days of picking rare bloodberries from barbed bushes for the screened <i>St. Anger</i> covers,
    which Lars assured us during his weekly motivational videos would only drive hard copy sales, I stripped
    my soiled black overalls, checked the bunks for banana spiders and sand ants, and settled in to read a
    tattered copy of Karl ""Geezer"" Marx and Frederick ""Freddi"" Engels' <i>Metal Manifesto</i>.  Few historians
    care to document the period in the early 1850s when the pair, influenced by the heart-wrenching blue-collar
    poems of Bob Seger, abandoned the Bund der Gerechten, shaved their beards, applied eye-silver and rouge,
    and produced a series of simpler, populist manifestos.</p><p>
    Often, I found myself reading the first line by Zippolight, unable to proceed further, lulling myself to
    sleep with its mantra:</p><p>
    ""A spectre is haunting Metal - the spectre of Metallica.""</p><p>
    Decades removed from its writing I didn't find the assertion particularly leveling or insightful.  Rather,
    I was amused by its irony.  Originally, Marx and Engels had hoped to shock their staid, academic readers
    with imagery of the undead, as with the Pushead-inked ""Red Monsta"" devouring Europe on the cover to their
    earlier Communist Manifesto.  Now the word ""spectre"" struck me only as a reminder that Metallica had long
    given up the ghost.  The manifesto remained only a document of arrogance and comedy.  Marx continued,
    ""Metallica is already acknowledged by all Rock powers to be itself a power.""  And yet, when MTV recently
    bestowed Metallica with ""Icon"" status, they could only dredge up Kelly Osbourne, Ja Rule, Sum 41, Godsmack,
    Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, Lisa Marie Presley, and Snoop Dogg in tribute.</p><p>
    Time had only made the rest of the text increasingly contradictory and meaningless.  Marx and Engels had
    seen Metal as the antisocial soundtrack that could topple pop for the hearts of the young.  ""Pop has
    converted the guitarist, the songwriter, the drummer, the man behind the boards, into its paid laborers,""
    they vented.  ""The Major Labels cannot exist without continually revolutionizing the instruments of
    production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relation between fans and
    artists.""</p><p>
    I read that last line while seated in a mule cart heading toward the Cardboard Folding Hut.  Behind me,
    shimmering cylinders of stacked <i>St. Anger</i> discs stood in tight rows, an electrical current coursing
    through them for defense.  I snapped the book shut, sickened by the absurdity.  If only Marx had lived to
    see the sides flip over a dwindling battle line.  For the first time, a technological advance-- MP3s and
    digital downloading-- spelled victory for the proletariat.  File-sharing had become as anti-establishment
    as Marx had envisioned metal sounding.  And Metallica, Marx's metal champion, had dropped an iron firewall
    between their music and their fans, who, despite their revolutionary ripping, were, for the most part,
    bourgeoisie boys choosing bands based on how the logos looked protractor-scratched into study hall desks.
    We kibbutz workers, who lived here by choice, manufacturing Metallica CDs, faced time in the Lightless Cell
    if found touching or ""experiencing"" <i>St. Anger</i> before its shipping date.  Yet James Hetfield seemed
    to always sing about being locked inside a Lightless Cell as a badge of honor.  Irony upon irony upon irony.
    Then again, Marx and Engels did grow their beards back and move on to more ambitious projects.</p><p>
    A banana spider bit into Ktulu the Mule's heel.  The animal reared.  The cart spilled its contents, the
    CDs and myself, into the dust.  A safety cut the electrical field protecting <i>St. Anger</i>.  As the
    cart master attempted to rein the bucking animal, I slipped a disc into my overalls.</p><p>
    After lights out (or ""enjoy the black"" as it was called), my bunkmates and I listened to the disc for which
    we had so diligently worked.  What an utter mess.  I saved 300 boxtops of Of Wolf and Man Cereal and bought
    a ticket to Israel for this?  Lars Ulrich had taken the return to ""real Metal"" quite literally, playing a
    drumset consisting of steel drums, aluminum toms, programmed double kicks, and a broken church bell.  The
    kit's high-end clamor ignored the basic principles of drumming: timekeeping.</p><p>
    Fittingly, Ulrich's scrapyard racket rang senselessly like quickening, imploding industry under filtered,
    stream-of-cliché riffing.  The gimmick overwhelmed entire songs, chiming hollowly over all else.  Hetfield
    and Hammett's guitars underwent more processing than cat food.  When they both speedstrummed through ""St.
    Anger"", and most other movements, H&amp;H; seemed to overwhelm each other with different, terrible noise.  A
    bevy of pedals-- including the decidedly un-metal wah-wah-- jingled conspicuously like a massive charm
    bracelet... I mean, a string of skulls.  A string of <i>iron</i> skulls.</p><p>
    A dry, crackling blooze melody squeezed out by Hammett on ""Some Kind of Monster"" brought to mind the time
    I used my practice amp as a stool in hanging a <i>Ride the Lightning</i> poster over my cot.  The amp
    teetered and toppled, sending my foot right through the speaker cone.  From then on I could only produce
    sounds exact to those on ""Some Kind of Monster"".  I just never thought to release them during the kibbutz's
    mandatory ""riffstorming"" sessions monitored by Hetfield via satellite from his motorcycle factory.  Bob
    Rock's bass neither bobbed nor rocked; it simply hid like an undulating grey amoeboid of sound, much like
    the web of hate pent inside the mind of the ""Invisible Kid"".</p><p>
    ""Invisible Kid"" towered as an example of Metallica's new alloy of ineptitude.  In the video feeds streaming
    throughout the mess hall, Hetfield repeatedly reminded us of the cathartic, psychological process behind
    <i>St. Anger</i>.  This implied a personal, emotional vent.  However, Hetfield can only convey feeling
    through the persona of the implied ""invisible kid"" who cowers from parents and rejection in every song,
    mirrored in the bedrooms of their audience.  Such juvenile confessionals as, ""I hurt inside/ I hide inside/
    But I'll show you,"" and, ""Mama, why's it rainin' in my room,"" sound ridiculous coming from the mouth of a
    40 year-old man.  Is this how he talks to his shrink?</p><p>
    These muscle car confessionals and jerky, rough-edged transitions sounded not so much like metal, but
    Bruckheimer emo.  Like Tim Kinsella, Hetfield found word pleasure in nursery puns such as ""purify/pure
    if I"" and ""ominous/I'm in us.""  When ""Frantic"" cut from the grunting, ""My lifestyle determines my
    deathstyle"" refrain and shifted into the cooed ""keep on searching"" breakdown, it smelled strongly of
    sloppy pseudo-virtuoso bands like The Jazz June or Spitalfield.  Emo bands found the simple process of
    merely moving from quiet to loud to be breathtaking.  They wrote songs where beauty and melody was assumed
    on the count of clean guitar and picking chords, despite the fact that the two guitars had no knowledge of
    each other.  In Metallica's case, the result was somehow worse for sounding so calculated and plotted in
    ProTools.  ProTools had never been metal.  ProTools never snorted ants up his FireWire from the side of the
    pool while urinating down a woman's dress.  ProTools never inserted the sound of a chainsaw into the opening
    of ""Black Metal"" off the album <i>Black Metal</i>.  ProTools never burned churches in Norway.  And yet,
    ProTools had a major hand in assembling both ""American Life"" and ""Frantic"".</p><p>
    The disc ended as the sun was rising over Syria.  Had it lasted that long?  My comrades and I looked at
    each other, stupefied.  Our only memory was of forced effects, laughable lyrics, and audio surgical scars.
    I sat up and began packing my duffel.  I'd rather pick bananas.  One comrade suggested smuggling the disc
    out of the kibbutz to leak to the Internet.  If Metallica were such proud artists behind their music,
    unable to both allow downloading and refund money after purchase, then we should warn others.  Metallica
    had become less a band leading a genre than a team soaking up payroll in a second-tier sport.  This was
    NASCAR, WWE.  Logos, sneers, mustaches, and beards.  Hair grows back, but the Jheri Curl of insincerity,
    of contradiction, and of compromising a cause never straightens.</p></div>"|5250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5250-st-anger/|0.8|Brent DiCrescenzo

    album before laying down their review, in order to establish some context, to make sure you're not just
    rehashing a tired angle.  <i>Reset the Preset</i> proved a difficult subject for such research-- since
    it had yet to achieve stateside release, the only reviews available online were in the group's native 
    German.  Fortunately for Pitchfork, I received four years of training in German back in
    high school; unfortunately for Pitchfork, all I remember are swear words, how to order a beer, and the
    correct way to announce ""I smoke cheese!""</p><p>
    
    However, I am also highly skilled in the use of the Google page translator, and fired it up to do my
    fact-checking on this lengthy double album.  I confirmed that Console is predominantly the work of
    Martin Gretschmann, who is ""also known for the electronic influence of the guitar-band The Notwist,
    in which he is a fixed member.""  Console's also earned some acclaim of his own with the Matador release
    <i>Rocket in the Pocket</i>, which featured the ""from the media high praised love-song to his computer,"" ""14
    Zero Zero"".</p><p>
    
    But the most helpful Germanic resource I found was an Amazon user review by one Juergen Albertson, a lad
    with a promising future in the boom market of poorly-translated criticism.  In his native language,
    the title of the review reads ""Guter Elektrorock!"" a statement that's not only accurate for the purposes of
    <i>Reset the Preset</i> but a ripe compilaton title just waiting to be plucked.  Yet somehow the translated version--
    ""Good Electrical Skirt!""-- is even more fitting, as Gretschmann enlists the singing talents of Miriam
    Osterreider on the poppier of the two stylistically-segregated discs.</p><p>
    
    Dubbed Reset, the first platter works like a photo-negative version of The Notwist: rock-accented
    electronic rather than the opposite.  Gretschmann shrugs off the recent IDM vogues, ignoring the glitch
    and only dipping his toes into the electroclash, instead choosing a fairly straightforward clubby
    sound: ""electrical skirt with genuine woman singing,"" as Juergen says.</p><p>
    
    ""Dirt on the Wire"" is the most effective of these, combining deep strobe light bass and loops with
    unexpected horn breaks and robotic vocals before stopping on a dime and reconstructing its genetic
    material into a new, more corporeal direction like a Sade remix.  Osterreider's Warwick act works well
    within the lap-pop constructs of Reset, her ability to emote more than your typical electro detachment
    sweetening the Morr-ish ""The Times They Are Not A-Changin'"" and floating amidst the synth-gaze ending
    of ""A+A=B"".  Juergen rightly points out that it sounds dangerously close to other Indietronica acts, but also
    says the material ""makes for all of us luckier humans.""  Well put.</p><p>
    
    Disc Two, Preset, is entirely instrumental, and launches with ""Diagonal"", which could be the score to
    <i>Terminator 4: The Machines and Humans Lay Down Their Weapons and Start a Groove Band Together</i>.  Tortoise-y
    with live drums and bass churning, while guitars and keyboards fight for melodic supremacy, it implies that
    Gretschmann is going to take a hack at German-ifying the Chicago sound.</p><p>
    
    Ach der lieber, If only it were so; instead much of the disc concerns itself with meandering soundscapes,
    offering up four original tracks alongside dubbier, sparser remixes.  Nothing offensively bad, mind you,
    but without much in the way of innovation it sounds like stock IDM gone stale: the nine-minute ""Marina""
    sets Barcelona street accordion against a tired trip-hop beat, ""Independencia"" scatters wholesale
    beat flurries amongst minimalist piano...Juergen calls it ""pluckernder, verschmitzter Ambient from the
    PowerBook,"" and I have to agree with him-- provided ""pluckernder"" and ""verschmitzter"" are as negative as
    they sound.</p><p>
    
    The organization of Reset the Preset makes it nice and clear what Console is best at producing: the
    digitized indie-pop of the first disc, and his work with The Notwist.  Stripped of traditional song
    structures and without a band to manipulate, Gretschmann's work can't seem to find a foothold to
    distinguish itself from the catalogs of other keyboard-slingers.  As a result, only occasionally do
    Console's ""sound surfaces join themselves perfectly unexpectedly from single noises and away-rinse us."" 
    Goddamn, no way can I top that.</p></div>"|1585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1585-reset-the-preset/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

Here, it's an industry, a part of the GNP-- even
    others countries' folk music is a commodity.  Playing music is a learned skill for most of us, a luxury,
    even a solitary form of expression, often never shared with the world at large.  Meanwhile, in parts of the
    third world, music is part and parcel with daily life, a communal language infused with ceremony, and
    integral to daily life.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps this helps explain why so little recorded music comes to us from outside
    the sphere of industrialized nations-- there's little focus on distributing and selling recorded music,
    even music with obvious commercial potential, in societies where making music isn't widely viewed as the
    province of the few.  All this makes a compilation like <i>Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk and Fusion in 70s
    Ghana</i> somewhat bittersweet.  Bitter because it's obvious that, without direct Western influence and a
    certain compromising of traditional lifestyles, this music never would have been made; sweet because the
    music is so, so good.</p><p>
    
    Like all of Africa, save Liberia (which was very nearly a U.S. colony), Ghana was once ruled by distant
    Europeans with no vested interest in the well-being of the local populace.  The British colonial authority
    in Ghana (they called it the Gold Coast, because its huge gold deposits were what they wanted it for) wasn't
    among the worst colonial governments, but foreign rule is always a dead-end street for the locals, and in
    1957, Ghana became one of the first European holdings in Africa to assert its independence, taking the name
    from an ancient and powerful trading empire that once controlled vast swaths of West Africa.  Ghana's
    boundaries are, of course, artificial, and Ghanaian society consists of no fewer than eight major
    ethnolinguistic groups, but the country has managed to remain peaceful in spite of numerous coups and
    failed experiments with democracy in its history.</p><p>
    
    The 70s marked an era of relative tolerance in Ghana, one in which the massive explosion of creativity that
    engulfed Western popular music in the late 60s found its way to Ghana.  There, Western music infused itself
    into Ghana's prevailing pop music style, Highlife, a gumbo of jazz, traditional rhythms and Liberian sailor
    songs that had dominated the popular music scene in urban Ghana since the 30s.  It's worth noting that Fela
    Kuti's earliest bands were essentially Highlife bands-- Nigeria and Ghana shared heritage as former British
    possessions and the music scenes in both countries often moved in parallel, though Nigeria's was far better
    funded and more visible.</p><p>
    
    The experimental bands that sprung up in Ghana, taking on funk, psychedelia and fusion, never really deposed
    Highlife from the top of the Ghanaian charts (if such a thing can really be said to have existed), but
    hundreds of highly unique recordings nonetheless found their way onto locally pressed shellac discs in Ghana
    in the mid-70s and the era left behind a spoil of riches that's only beginning to come back to light, thanks
    largely to this disc, the first in what promises to be a series of three volumes.</p><p>
    
    These songs tread a startling range of ground, but a few things hold true across all of them: they're
    ebullient and virtually apolitical, and the rhythm is the key.  The compilation kicks off with three
    breakneck, fantastic funk tracks that are impossible not to groove to.  The Third Generation Band's ""Because
    of Money"" is full of tribal percussion and hypnotic guitar, but it's really ""Bukom Mashie"" by Oscar Sulley
    &amp; The Uhuru Dance Band that brings things into high gear.  The song slams in with a killer drum vamp and
    before you can even fully wrap your head around how awesome it is, the bassist drops this fantastically
    buoyant line that'll have you looking around for someone to high-five.  A huge, sax-dominated horn section
    blasts out an odd mixture of hot jazz, spy theme-ish drama and dancehall celebration that sucks the breath
    from your lungs.</p><p>
    
    It's incredible how excellent each song here is.  Marijata's ""Mother Africa"" is one of the best funk tracks
    I've ever heard, raw and filthy and tumbling along at ramjet tempo.  Another personal favorite is Gyedu Blay
    Ambolley &amp; The Steneboofs' ""Simigwado"", a strange tune built on a funky vamp that veers into spoken word
    passages (I'm not sure of the language) where Ambolley's flow picks up the rhythmic momentum and becomes
    the song's primary driving force.  Honny &amp; The Bees Band are the most overtly Western-influenced band here--
    the backing vocals between verses sound almost like a Yardbirds guitar part.  And then there's the shocking
    ring-modulated synthesizer solos that show up in the offerings from K. Frimpong &amp; His Cubano Fiestas and a
    band called The African Brothers.  Rob's ""Make It Fast, Make It Slow"" practically sounds like a D'Angelo
    track, with its slow, trunk-rattling beat anticipating every sleazy bed track that ever cropped up on a
    hip-hop album.</p><p>
    
    You have to hear for yourself to truly understand the magnitude of what was happening in Ghanaian music in
    the 70s, unbeknownst to the rest of the world.  This music sears, and the track selection here is impeccable.
    I've heard so many cheap-ass ""world music"" comps over the years that it's truly refreshing to hear one quite
    so expertly assembled-- it's not even presented as a world music compilation, so much as a collection of
    little-heard tracks that happen to be from Ghana.  <i>Ghana Soundz</i> shines a long-overdue light on the
    best kind of music scene-- one in which creativity and simple joy took precedence over sales or posturing.
    We could learn from it.</p></div>"|2000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2000-ghana-soundz-afrobeat-funk-fusion-in-70s-ghana/|8.8|Joe Tangari

    melody somewhere before. It doesn't nag at you or scream ""derivative""; it's not, for example, like hearing
    a sampled loop and not resting until you've pinned down the source. Instead, one gets the feeling from
    <i>For Frosty Mornings and Summer Nights</i> of settling into old pajamas, sitting in oversized chairs on
    the beach, getting lost in the woods behind your house on purpose. A nostalgic mood tints the whole album,
    creating an aural equivalent to Super 8 home movies-- taken, most likely, on Mars. Like Boards of Canada,
    whose artwork and imagery intentionally conjure visions of nylon jackets, sepia tone and childhood circa
    1977 in general, Xela (John Twells) crafts songs that are clear in their emotion, focused and difficult
    to misread.</p><p>
    Not a little of the album's approach is inspired by Twell's friend Lee Norkin and his work under the guise
    of Metamatics; his <i>Neo Ouija</i> album is a definite mentor here, though without the more dance-fueled
    rhythms Norkin flexes with that name. ""Under the Glow of Streetlights"" and the ponderous, patient ""The Long
    Walk Home at Midnite"", whose pleasures are revealed slowly and with keen pacing, are good examples of the
    beats to be found on <i>For Frosty Mornings</i>: as fractured as Dos Tracks or early Pole, but with a wide
    berth between the pieces. At their most coherent, the rhythms on the record are inspired click 'n' cut
    textures, lazy BPMs that ride the ambience through till the end. The closer, ""Last Breathe"", pulls off a
    beat I can only describe as tropical, and backs it with a crying trumpet and the sobs of a woman, and
    while Manitoba and Marumari can conjure similar vibes, it's impressive how well Xela works it.</p><p>
    It's the ambient elements, the gentle ebb and flow of layers of synth and extended chords, where the
    influences show the most. Marumari, <i>Selected Ambient Works</i>, WE; all of them know how to pull this
    technique off, and Xela adds himself to their ranks by copping a few licks here and there: ""Afraid of Nowhere""
    bears The Mark of the 'Twin, and as excellent as ""Japanese Whispers"" gets, it's still leaning a bit heavily
    on the shoulder of Prefuse 73, with <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i> driving it to the airport. The
    sullen ""An Abandoned Robot"" fares better, raining down shimmering chimes into a thick soup of chords,
    rippling out and out and out, punctuated with Oval-ish skips and crackles provided by Stefan Lewandowski.</p><p>
    I drive through the woods to work now, and with all the partially sunny days lately, <i>For Frosty Mornings</i>
    has been perfect for a sleepy, half-lit drive home over the mountain. It gets under your skin not with hooks
    or basslines, but with a mood that the chosen tones and pacing enforce for the duration of the record. It
    plays like a cohesive whole, a steady set of hills and valleys with perfect curves. It may go unnoticed on
    a label like Neo Ouija, whose content can often be described on similar terms, but Xela has put out a fucking
    nice record, a chill-out album that makes the term ""chill-out"" respectable again. This album is a sleeper in
    every sense of the word. Funkstörung for the content and drowsy.</p></div>"|8818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8818-for-frosty-mornings-and-summer-nights/|7.2|Mark Martelli

I, too, have been appearing     in small southern towns in front of handfuls of hillbillies lately, and uh... I've been doubting my own     existence,"" lamented Bill Hicks in his unmistakably rueful Texas drawl.  Speaking about the perils and     inherent loneliness of life on the road as a nomadic stand-up comic, there wasn't a member of the audience     capable of ignoring the arrant honesty of his words.</p>
<p>Bill Hicks is our planet's most oft-revered, imitated, plagiarized and anonymous comedic talent.  For as     many people whose lives were impacted so indelibly by this man's genius, wit, and irreverence, he remains     shrouded in mystery to the general public.  When his life was tragically snatched away by pancreatic cancer     at the age of 32, Hicks hovered precariously on the precipice of superstardom.  Having attracted national     attention as the first act banned from a CBS television program since Elvis Presley, and with a legion of     obstreperous followers behind him, Bill Hicks' untimely passing served as his ultimate comedic closer.     With a career built upon hostility, angst, scathing social commentary, and above all, compassion, Hicks'     abrupt departure virtually sealed his fate as a contemporary cultural enigma.</p>
<p>In the nine years since his passing, Bill Hicks has taken on neo-mythical status.  Drawing plaudits from     myriad pop culture icons, album dedications from the likes of Tool and Radiohead, and galvanizing the     malevolence of cynics everywhere, his fame has soared exponentially.  Unlike so many mediocre icons who     find notoriety and mass-media acceptance in death, however, Bill Hicks was a man whose art transcended all     time and spatial limits and thus established his legend long before his enormous heart stopped beating on     February 26th, 1994.</p>
<p>Bill Hicks was Noam Chomsky, David Sedaris, Lenny Bruce, and Carlos Castaneda rolled into one.   Where other     comedians like the late great Sam Kinison identified and ridiculed the problems of modern life for the     purpose of shock and laughter, Hicks abhorred the passivity of the populace to such lengths that his rants     rang closer to a guerilla revolutionary than a talking head with a microphone.</p>
<p>No one has ever been more vocal about the evils of disposable pop culture.  A society rendered mentally mute     by the ills of marketing, advertising, and corporate dogma spelled the very death of this country and by     extension, western civilization.  Years before Chuck Palahnuik drafted a blueprint for eschewing convention     by relinquishing all ties to commercialism in <i>Fight Club</i>, and thus making anti-commercialism more     commercial, Hicks scripted a rousing fight song with the intent of impugning everything unholy and dangerous     in the world of capitalism.  Foremost on the list was the evil known as laziness.  Not laziness in the     casually procrastinating sense, but rather the much graver error of cultural indolence.  Essentially, people     who've grown weary of their power to discern submit to the demands of fictional authoritative figures (i.e.     media) who dictate their tastes, interests, opinions, and beliefs.</p>
<p>What results from this ""dumbing down"" is a culture of people who have forgotten how to judge correctly.  A     group of people-- some of whom are reading this review-- that find themselves on the wet end of a degenerate     culture. A culture erected from the cancerous mutation of hype machines, spin, and an elitist social sect     designed to capitalize on the acquiescence of its members.  These same idle sheep find themselves flocking     to inferior merchandise simply to nestle snuggly within an arbitrary hipness quotient, and because of the     concomitant satisfaction in rallying behind mediocre products with strong PR.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Bill Hicks Estate, Ryko recently released two CDs worth of (mostly) previously     unreleased material entitled <i>Flying Saucer Tour, Vol. 1</i> and <i>Love, Laughter and Truth</i>.     Recorded at a non-smoking venue June 20th, 1991 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a city better suited for gun     shows, tractor pulls, and Klan rallies than the musings of Hicks, <i>Flying Saucer Tour, Vol. 1</i> gives     us a keen view of Hicks at his most indecently acerbic. He starts off with one of his customary targets     (non-smokers), informing the largely disinterested crowd that, despite their effort to remain healthy,     smoke-free beings, their demise is as inevitable as his.  The sheer frenzy of Hicks' nicotine addiction--     according to Hicks, ""I go through two lighters a day""-- is matched only by his lust for disgusting the     audience with references ranging from tracheotomies, premature birth, and lung cancer.</p>
<p>Within a mere ten minutes it's become painfully apparent that Hicks has completely alienated the incoherent     Pittsburgh crowd. When the sound of low grumbling is the only response to a rant on the cyclically relevant     tensions in Iraq, Hicks dubs the crowd the worst he's ever faced.  After several more unsuccessful attempts     to rouse interest, Hicks focuses his vitriol solely on the audience.  With his frustration nearly at critical     level, Hicks taunts the slack-jawed audience with a promise of ""dick jokes"" mere seconds before (repeatedly)     pleading that a nuclear holocaust befalls the mostly yuppie crowd.</p>
<p>Although Hicks generally thrived on a perplexed audience, the uncanny bemusement of the Pittsburgh crowd on     <i>Saucer, Vol. 1</i> forced Hicks to cloak most of his societal observations in blatant shock. If there's     one detriment to the disc, it's Hicks' tendency to push moral limits a bit too far for gasps and groans.     For every schoolyard chord Hicks strikes, there's at least three absolute chasms of silent confusion, wherein     the entirety of his commentary on the corruption of President Bush (the elder), the governmentally endorsed     lies on narcotics, and the value of pornography in art is completely lost on the audience.  Only when Hicks     posits celebrities hawking commercial products on television as akin to fellating Satan's penis is there     anything resembling a functional synapse present in the Pittsburgh comedy club.</p>
<p>By contrast, <i>Love, Laughter and Truth</i> functions as a sort of greatest hits package, compiling     recordings made in Denver, San Ramon, San Francisco, and West Palm Beach from 1990 to 1993.  Most fascinating     about <i>Love, Laughter and Truth</i> is the evolutionary window it provides us on the career of Bill Hicks.     We witness his development from the lounge lizard rube to the denunciatory comedic sage.  When Hicks unleashes     a rampage on the commodification of ""drugs"" in the form of subversive Public Service Announcements and beer     commercials, he deftly blends the thermonuclear vocal explosion preferred by fellow Texan Sam Kinison with     the kind of shadow government social paranoia familiar to fans of George Carlin.  But while Kinison was     content to rest on fireworks, and Carlin typically rants to draw blood, Hicks seized the role of sobering     realist.  When confronted by an audience more comfortable with schoolyard sex fare than education and     self-awareness, Hicks assumes the voice of a member of his audience and recriminates, ""Doesn't he know about     our puritanical self-hatred of our own body and its desires?  The only way we can find relief is through the     medium of penis material.""</p>
<p>George Carlin, and to some extent Dennis Miller, have built careers upon spewing facts and figures in the     most abrasive manner possible.  In fact, Carlin's famous bit on euphemistic language can be viewed as a     crude blueprint to what would shortly become Hicks' legacy.  Expressing disgust at how emotion has been     squelched out of the English language in order to create a softer existence for mankind, Carlin astutely     recognizes the inherent danger to masking and muddling meaning with lots of extraneous words, syllables,     and hyphens.  Real life Newspeak was always a major preoccupation of Hicks' as well.  And although George     Carlin was content to condemn the government and lukewarm civilization who'd allowed meaningless jargon to     pervert the language, Bill Hicks always remained optimistic about the possibility, no matter how remote,     that civilization might one day awake from its golden slumber.</p>
<p>We live in a time where the Orwellian lexicon is at its zenith.  Between the low and steady buzz of ""weapons     of mass destruction,"" the thinly veiled liberty confiscation machine dubbed ""The Department of Homeland     Security,"" a feckless, oil-smeared ""road map"" to peace for people who've hated each other since time     immemorial, and a feel-good fruit colored Terrorist Threat spectrum that has more in common with a bag of     Skittles than a system of effective deterrence, it's quite simple to lose sight to distinguish what is real     from what isn't.</p>
<p>I've often felt cheated that Hicks wasn't alive to witness September 11th, 2001 and the subsequent chain of     events.  Aside from the comedic field day he'd undoubtedly have with the American programs mentioned above,     Hicks might have provided some of the most lucid and trenchant analysis of exactly what's happened in the     past two years.  Hicks' supreme gift was being blessed with a coping skill sorely lacking in most of us:     the ability to instantiate what is real from what is illusory, what is valid from what is disposable.</p>
<p>At the crux of his work was the following question: does the plight Beyond Good and Consumerism imply foregoing     personal happiness?  If my years studying Hicks have been fruitful, the answer would be no.  We can remain     informed and aware in spite of marketing ploys and ambiguous language designed to lower standards and public     awareness, delighted by the fact that we get the joke while others do not.  As Hicks himself might have said,     we're all capable of loving rather than fearing.  Some of us require chemical assistance to attain higher     consciousness, while others will find that enhanced state in something as basic as the companionship of     another person.  Whatever our means of mind expansion, we must never lose sight of the fact that life is     nothing more than a brief detour to something better, something more fulfilling.

Do you understand this sentence? It says, ""Now I know     what it feels like to listen to Looper when you can't understand English,""     as translated into Italian by Google. And what I mean by it is this: If     you don't know Italian, I wouldn't recommend picking up this record.</p><p><em>City Reading</em> is a collaboration between Air and writer Alessandro     Baricco, in which Baricco reads text from his novel, <em>City</em>, to     Air's backing tracks. The three explain how it went down in the liner notes:</p><p><em>""</em>City<em> is a book. The idea was to read some pages of it aloud, in     a theater full of people, with musical accompaniment throughout. We did this     in Rome, in November of 2002. It went well. The audience applauded, and we     enjoyed ourselves. So the idea became: to make a CD in which a voice is reading,     surrounded by music. We recorded the CD in Paris, a month later. We enjoyed     ourselves. Now the idea is to make a video game. But we're not really sure     about that.""</em></p>
<p>I don't doubt that this pairing set the Roman throng cheering. Air's tasteful,     wistful, and occasionally mournful tunes are an intelligent compliment to a     reading, and their decision to mix lots of acoustic guitar with organ, flute     and sound effects subliminally bonds with the plot (<em>City</em> is a trilogy     of surreal, poetic Westerns.) And however Baricco's prose reads in his native     language (an English translation is included in the CD booklet), there's no     doubting that he has a fantastically great speaking voice-- clear, rhythmic,     musical and dramatic. It was, I'm sure, an inspired pairing.</p>
<p>All that, however, isn't enough to add up to repeated listens for me, because     I can't follow it. I tried scanning the English translation of the text while     listening, but it didn't interest me. Baricco's voice is <em>very</em> high in     the mix, so much so that focusing on anything but him speaking the words is     impossible. Even so, it probably wouldn't matter much if the mix were more     music-oriented. Somewhere back there, behind Baricco's purr, Air's tracks     sound nice enough, although the cues they've constructed are obviously     repetitive and meant as a soundtrack to something more important.</p>
<p>Though I get off on the pure sound of language as much as the next guy, I     still don't find <em>City Reading</em> entertaining. I'm not complaining,     really. It is what it is, and there's certainly no reason why Air should     feel compelled to pander to my embarrassing monolingualism by working     with, say, an English writer. All I can say is that <em>City Reading</em> is     essentially a book on tape with high production values in a language I don't     understand, and that, even if it were released in an instrumental version,     it wouldn't be particularly breathtaking. Caveat emptor.</p>

    up to the break of punk.  There was already a frighteningly diverse school of simultaneous evolutions happening in the late 60s, from the proto-metal 
    of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, to the early progressive rock of Yes, Genesis and King Crimson, to intricate folk of Pentangle and the Fairport 
    Convention, to the budding indie-pop of David Bowie and Marc Bolan, to experimental, jazz-driven outfits like Canterbury's Soft Machine.  At the 
    dawn of the 70s, all these strands of rock and beyond were set adrift to follow their own paths, never to meet again (though musicians would often 
    infiltrate one camp or another, blurring the lines of \x93genre\x94).  This period, roughly 1968 to 1971, is almost a forgotten era in British rock-- 
    unless you've closely followed one or more of the above artists, in which case it starts to look like a classic era.</p><p>
    Stereolab's Simon Johns and his band Imitation Electric Piano haven't forgotten those years.  Working with multi-instrumentalist 
    Lee Adams, drummer Ashley Marlowe, bassist Andrew Blake and a few others, Johns' band follows a similar trajectory as a few bands mentioned above, 
    most notably the wry progressive psyche of early Soft Machine and other like-minded bands such as National Health.  The band also shares quite a few 
    similarities with Stereolab, especially in their lapses into motorik and post-rock pulsating drive, and their love of vintage instrumentation 
    (imitation electric piano ain't just a band name).  Johns wrote or co-wrote all of the music here, and handles all lead vocals (appearing on about half 
    of the record).  His understated baritone is a nice foil for the extended pieces, though, like recent Stereolab, the band has a tendency to veer into 
    the background.</p><p>
    Though Johns does sing on several tracks, <i>Trinity Neon</i> seems more like a sequence of (sometimes lengthy) instrumental impressions, encouraging 
    listeners to wander in and out of the music.  \x93The Khartoum Venus\x94 begins as a minor-key funk vamp, led by muted trumpet and the kind of spidery organ 
    lick that hasn't been popular since Rod Argent bought his first Hammond.  This segues into a deft, hard trance rock that sounds obviously similar to 
    Stereolab.  Likewise, \x93Don't Tell Me I'm Wrong (But You Are)\x94 is reminiscent of <i>Cobra and Phases </i> period 'Lab with its lounge-y take on jazz-rock, right 
    down to the busy drumming and harpsichord touches.  \x93Chronicle of a Spirit Foretold\x94 steps a bit further out, and though it's hardly avant-garde, does 
    blend its mellotron tones and odd-metered, syncopated rhythms in a way more akin to 70s psyche-prog than 90s post-rock.</p><p>
    The liveliest moments on the record occur on \x93Theme for an Imitation Electric Piano\x94, which features Johns \x93rockin' and rollin'\x94 his way through 
    prime pep.  The jam-band ending is a bit unexpected-- who knew these guys were such guitar heroes?-- but it's nice to hear them step out of their 
    pristine arrangements every now and then.  The opener \x93Gin Lane\x94 begins as a gentle pop lilt, with Johns lamenting that he'll \x93never see you, or hear you 
    again.""  The pace picks up, but the song never seems overly fussy-- one of Imitation Electric Piano's strengths is that they're able to make fairly 
    complex things sounds simple.  Even the full ensemble counterpoint in the middle seems perfectly natural.</p><p>
    If you're one of those not completely perturbed at the last few Stereolab records, there is a good chance you'll find something of interest on <i>Trinity 
    Neon</i>.  Proximity aside, the record is a virtual goldmine for laid-back British jazz-rock, though don't go expecting anything terribly \x93out"": it's a 
    uniformly pleasant record, and that's probably the best and worst I can say about it.  If Johns' reference to Robert Wyatt in the liner notes causes a 
    spike in \x93Moon In June\x94 downloads, I'd call it a resounding success.</p></div>"|4077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4077-trinity-neon/|6.6|Dominique Leone

    threatening to fold in on one other like uninspired origami.  At this very moment, somewhere outside the Detroit city line, around a hidden bend, an
    overcrowded field of garage rockers are a-nodding their greasy hair to the cool summer breeze, endlessly enslaved by a 60s mixed metaphor, Camel
    non-filters spoiling the honeysuckle wonderfulness of the atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    Whenever a genre explodes, begins copulating with itself, and goes to seed all kinds of reckless, it can be a bitch-and-a-half separating the singular
    wheat from the inbred chaff. If you listened to every third Nick Zinner wannabe in town, you'd never make it home to enjoy black coffee and the less
    co-opted strains of your record collection. Sorrow of all sorrows, you might even pass away with D4 on your walkman. Garage rock is the grunge of today,
    which makes grunge today's hair-metal and leaves the new Vince Neil-fronted Poison in pretty good striking
    position to make an ironic comeback by next Fall. When a trend gets this out-of-control, I usually nod away, figure the rest of those punk-asses can
    MC5 it out amongst themselves 'cause I'm too old to scour local toy stores for the musical equivalent of a Cabbage Patch Kid or Tickle Me Elmo.</p><p>
    
    I'm framing a review of The Von Bondies in this backstory to better point out the Detroit foursome's achievement: of all the garage rock kids I've
    listened to in the past six months they're my favorite by a mile, and <i>Raw and Rare</i>, the group's live album-- a teaser to keep folks primed for
    their upcoming second full-length, <i>Pawn Shoppe Heart</i>-- is fucking spooky-ass, grimy rock-n-roll fun.</p><p>
    
    Why a live record so early in the game?  A fair enough question.  But remember this: their Jack-White produced debut, 2001's <i>Lack of Communication</i>, sold 20,000
    worldwide. That's nothing to sneeze at.  This disc's fifteen live and prerecorded tracks were taken from two BBC Radio Broadcasts and a performance at the Lager House
    in the band's hometown (the two US-recorded tracks, ""Unknown"" and ""It Came from Japan"", are the grubbiest, and the only ones that sound fuzzily ""live"", in that tinny,
    almost-bad way-- I guess that's the ""raw"" of the title?)  You get to hear the band tuning up, the crowd making little noises, the between-song banter, the songs expanding
    into finessed jam territory, and the dank echo of the room.  Though the songs here are largely available as studio takes on <i>Lack of Communication</i>, a band like
    The Von Bondies benefits from such unadorned documentation; in a one-take context everything just seems that much more propulsive and urgent.</p><p>
    
    Throughout this album, these two men and two women sound absolutely joyful, like the music's a curative.
    There's great boy/girl harmonizing on ""Please Please Man"" and ""Going Down"", entire-band harmonizing on
    ""It Came from Japan"", and a manic handclapping barrage on ""Vacant as a Ghost"".  ""My Baby's Cryin'""-- a
    slight ""It Came from Japan"" B-side sung by guitarist Marci Bolen (ex-Slumber Party)-- is made mightier
    through its pairing with ""Cryin'"" from <i>Lack of Communication</i>. It shows up twice on this CD, in
    two slightly different versions-- one live, one pre-recorded; ""It Came from Japan"" is also repeated, the
    second version a fuzzy Monoshock mess.</p><p>
    
    Aside from the originals, The Von Bondies also dig groove-first into two covers. The eight-minute version
    of 60s staple ""Take a Heart"" by English garage visionaries The Sorrows is slinky and dirty, and takes enough
    patient time and care to warrant its ricocheting guitar-piss climax.  And the live retooling of the Compulsive
    Gamblers' ""Rock &amp; Roll Nurse"" is equally well-wrought-- punch-drunk, sex-freak gritty in its instrumental
    dueling.</p><p>
    
    So why do I give props to The Von Bondies, but not to so many other chumps in the pack? Because instead of
    rote masturbation to genre tropes, this band blends equal parts Misfits and The Animals into their own
    distinctive Halloween sound; Jason Stollsteimer (guitar, vocals) writes prime hooks, and the entire band
    offers boatloads of hardcore flesh-and-blood energy. Save yourself some time and forget the flabby pretenders,
    already! I'm sure the upcoming <i>Pawn Shoppe Heart</i> will be even stronger (and the new material less
    familiar), but for now, plop this baby in, howl at the moon, dance 'til you drop, and pass out in your
    own whiskey vomit.</p></div>"|8490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8490-raw-and-rare/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

    Zeppelin.  The band was a big, dumb example of every opulent shark-story rock cliché of the 1970s: They
    were heavy-handed, irresponsible purveyors of the ""blues""; they were fake hippies and fake mystics who
    managed to strip even the grandest statements in rock of their power via mind-numbing drum solos and
    bowed-guitar expositions; they were the original Spinal Tap, replete with whole songs about Greek myths,
    ancient Celtic rituals, completely inappropriate bits of Bach spliced into Page's ""Heartbreaker"" solo,
    and a manager who was at once imposing, apologetic and the butt of Bob Dylan's jokes.  One more thing:
    They were the greatest rock band to ever set foot on a stage, so what they fuck are you talking about?</p><p>
    As they often do, things started small for this band of castaways and unknowns: Session guitarist Jimmy Page
    found himself thrown under the bus, holding the shitbag when The Yardbirds called it quits smack in the
    middle of a 1968 American tour.  He was forced to piece together whatever ensemble he could to continue the
    tour, finding bassist and fellow session man John Paul Jones through a newspaper ad.  Teen vocalist Robert
    Plant and his mate John Bonham were in Birmingham, discovered by Page on a talent-hunting expedition.  The
    band were a rag-tag bunch, who were, if anything, most certainly <i>not</i> The Yardbirds.  Nevertheless,
    after a few successful shows in the UK, they went to America, billed as ""Supporting Act"" in a another Spinal
    Tap twist of fate.  By the end of their tour, they were headlining, and the rest is history.  Right?</p><p>
    Well, it's tricky.  Led Zeppelin, authors of the most-played-song-in-radio-history and so many hallowed
    riffs and sexual double-entendres involving fruit, are so played-out at this point that they've managed to
    become taken for granted.  Nobody blinks an eye when ""Rock and Roll"" shows up in a car commercial, because
    the band's music has long since become a pop-culture building block.  Most of their big tunes are
    recognizable to the point of losing their emotional impact-- think, haven't you heard enough of ""Whole
    Lotta Love"", ""Black Dog"" and ""Kashmir""?   And I might give a month off the end of my life to be spared
    from ever crossing paths with ""Stairway to Heaven"" again.  Sure, Zep is great, but their classic-rock
    staples have been burnt into our minds-- each song exactly the same every time we hear it-- as unchanging
    musical patterns, and made predictable by force of infinite repetition.  By now I'd think I'd have gleaned
    about as much pleasure from their music as I possibly could.</p><p>
    Still, one thing that always strikes me about all of their music-- particularly their first five or six
    records-- is how effortless they made it all seem.  Classic riffs seem like grade school basics now, but
    Page actually had to come up with all that stuff.  And if you listen really close, those guys were doing
    more than just banging out the blues-- they brought out the best of a British take on rock, via funky,
    surprisingly accomplished arrangements and song forms, and a very potent eclecticism rarely found in bands
    that cracked the mainstream (much less reigned over it).  And yet, none of those credentials really make
    me want to hear ""The Battle of Evermore"" again.  So what's next?</p><p>
    Jimmy Page found the two 1972 Los Angeles shows featured on the triple disc <i>How the West Was Won</i>
    while poring over his archives for what was to be a straight DVD release.  And just like that, new magic
    is cast, new legends are born.  One of the interesting things about Zep (and if you believe the rockists,
    this holds true for any truly ""great"" band) is that they made their most definitive statements in concert.
    The shows on this set document a band who were able to wring squeals, clangs and beats out of material that
    had been well considered and digested a million times over by performers and audience alike.  Yes, they
    stretch out, often to near excruciatingly immense duration, but they also emphasize their greatest talents.
    Chiefly, <i>How the West Was Won</i> serves up the band's muscle, sweaty heart and golden grandeur in an
    exhaustingly persuasive light.  That, and a hundred of the best riffs you've ever heard.</p><p>
    Disc 1 keeps the exploratory blues odysseys to a minimum, though hardly at the expense of the epic saga
    that was their live power.  In fact, from the furious, breakneck take of ""Immigrant Song"" to the almost
    otherworldly, ethereal ""Going to California"", it's one of the best sets of live music I've ever heard on
    CD.  The band rips through most of the harder numbers a few notches faster than the album versions, and in
    the process, staves off most of the over-familiarity prone to live records.  ""Black Dog"" gets a speed metal
    intro.  ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" is transformed from its classic boogie-rock into an altogether rougher,
    funky jab.  ""That's the Way"" (possibly the only Zep tune still underrated) and ""Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp"" form an
    acoustic mini-set with ""Going to California"" that yet again shows these guys were a lot more than barrelhouse
    blues riffs and high-heeled groupies in the hallway.  And then there's ""Stairway"".  It would take a lot to
    make this one fresh again, but I'll say that their slightly thrashy run-through at the end (with Jones on...
    piano?) and a few new guitar tricks during the intro do small wonders.</p><p>
    Things take a turn for the far-out on Disc 2, beginning with the in-out-back-in-again-hold-up-we're-out-now
    version of ""Dazed and Confused"".  The band takes its time easing into the tune, with a spooky bass- and
    drum-led funeral procession intro, but soon enough finds the jam.  The song's infamous mid-section freakout
    gets everything it could have possibly had coming to it, including unexpected lapses into ""The Crunge"" and
    ""Walter's Walk"", in addition to giving Page his solo space and then some.  25 (!!) minutes later, they find
    the road again, somehow all ending up in the same place.  Perhaps to recover, they follow with brisk versions
    of ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" (sounding now like a brutal piece of blue funk rather than its more
    famous loungy rock version) and the then-unreleased ""Dancing Days"".  And then, the monster: almost 20
    minutes of pounding, snapping and crashing on ""Moby Dick"", courtesy of the rock-solid, gorilla-footed Bonzo,
    probably fresh from having a Roadster delivered to his hotel that morning.  Truth be told, if you had to
    take a snack break about ten minutes in, I wouldn't blame you.</p><p>
    ""Whole Lotta Love"" gets the epic expansion on Disc 3, including a medley of no less than four complete
    versions of old rock and roll tunes inserted smack in the middle.  But before that happens, they pull out
    all the spacy effects available to the super-wealthy in 1972, and don't forget to liven them up with a
    little skank-beat (who knew Zep could play ska?).  Despite the detour, ""Rock and Roll"" doesn't sound tired
    for it-- and it shouldn't, as Page took the best performances from two shows to concoct the three-disc
    ""concert.""  And finally, the set ends in authentic 70s roots style with a cover of Willie Dixon's ""Bring
    It on Home"", beginning with an understated harmonica-led intro before ramming it all back down with the
    sick-ass beats and engulfing bass rumble that had defined the previous couple of hours.  Is this really
    the blues?  Is this Blues Hammer?  Nothing like it, I'm afraid-- it's Led Zeppelin, and for better (yay)
    or worse (nay), they only knew how to hit their own thing.</p><p>
    I'm not one for reminiscing the classics, and in fact, I'm pretty sick of hearing about how great everything
    was supposed to be all those years ago (whatever years you happen to be talking about).  That said, Page and
    company have done a nice job making me believe I've missed out on something special even when I thought I
    knew all this stuff backwards and forwards.  Far from just a fan relic, much of <i>How the West Was Won</i>
    seems definitive, and maybe that explains why it happens to be the biggest selling record in the country at
    the time of this writing.  Maybe there are bands tearing shit up like this now, I can't really be sure, but
    of this I am: Zep ruled, check it.</p></div>"|4707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4707-how-the-west-was-won/|8.8|Dominique Leone

    I rolled my eyes and sank back into the uncomfortable lawn chair.  My reason for sitting idly in the hot sun that day-- wrinkled feet soaking in a brilliantly colored kiddy-pool-- was my friend 
    Trent, who'd invited me over to see the new animal he had gotten for his little girl.  Enticing me with the promise that the pet had a talent I would have to see to believe, his Shetland-- 
    coincidentally named Pink Anvil-- had yet to impress me with anything beyond how one little creature could produce so much dung.</p><p>
    Eventually fed up-- and halfway to a heat stroke-- I gathered my things to leave as Trent attempted to bar my way.  Suddenly, his hand in my face, I heard it-- the sinister opening chords 
    of Schubert's <i>The Erlking</i>, simultaneously hummed and neighed by the tiny and unassuming Pink Anvil.  The lied was ugly but recognizable, nearly making it worth sitting in listless 
    uneasiness for the past few hours.</p><p>
    ""That's pretty cool!""  With visions of Schumann and Carnaval in mind, I inquired, ""What else can it do?""</p><p>
    ""Uh, unfortunately,"" Trent said, his eyes not meeting mine, ""that's its only trick.""</p><p>
    I was disappointed, but his ashamed admission brought to mind an interesting inquiry-- should the listening public demand anything more of a novelty act than what it is-- a novelty?  
    This question was begged many times during my exposure to <i>Halloween Party</i>, the debut album by Ministry's Paul Barker and Max Brody, working together under the non-metaphorical 
    nomen Pink Anvil.</p><p>
    Described as a continuation of the avant-garde experimentalism of Brian Eno and David Byrne's <i>My Life In the Bush of Ghosts</i>, <i>Halloween Party</i> suggests Brody and 
    Parker might have slept through the majority of the classic album, awaking only to hear a few minutes of ""Mea Culpa"" before deciding that that was ""good enough.""  Whereas Eno 
    and Byrne sought to create myriad moods, textures and musical forms with their project, <i>Halloween Party</i>-- recorded near the Mexican border using a similar setup of FM radio, 
    patchbay, and some delay pedals-- creates merely a two dimensional backdrop of horror-show found sounds and campy B-movie soundtracks (""Unmerry"", ""Rubber Suit, Pt. 2"", 
    and ""Adagio in Cb""), with an occasional sprinkling of harsh programmed drum-beats in the style that has come to be expected from the Ministry-brethren 
    (""Downer"", ""Sugarwater"", and ""Near Death"").</p><p>
    ""Rubber Suit"" (traditional) delivers some surprises as a satisfying minor-chord keyboard progression is interrupted by a series of screams, moans, and howls that nearly jars the listener 
    out of the catatonic lull induced by the album, providing one of the few sincerely enjoyable moments of the disc.  Unfortunately, the moment is ruined as a rush of white noise and 
    borrowed horns quickly betray the suspense, causing the song to flounder in its own directionless and mocking continuation.  Even more regrettable: with the sense of expectancy 
    established, the remainder of the album-- particularly the otherwise pleasant, ""Desert""-- is robbed of any gripping shock value, which is the lone motive one might have in purchasing 
    an album like <i>Halloween Party</i> in the first place.</p><p>
    Press comparisons peg the duo as a contemporary of noise-artists Black Dice and Sightings, but on the merits of this album alone, it's difficult to understand the foundation for these 
    claims.  The bands mentioned above exhibit dynamic displays of instrumentation with rich and inventive layering of the sonic building blocks at their disposal, while 
    Pink Anvil is content to haphazardly plug away at the dried husk of a once venerable musical concept.  It's unfair to presume they should share the limelight with those on the 
    forefront of musical innovation simply because they have more history: as Pink Anvil, they're second-stringers, a pair of transient one-trick ponies.</p></div>"|6520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6520-halloween-party/|3.1|Andrew Bryant

Contrary to the belief that singles have gone digital-- that nobody would pay     almost ten bucks for one new song when they could just steal it, or grab it for 99¢ through iTunes'     ""Save Apple Computers: Again"" fund, Sigur Rós has released two versions of the first single from <i>( )</i>.     Last month we got a three-inch CD for ""Untitled #1"", packaged in white like a box of Chiclets; now there's     a follow-up that pairs the same music with a bonus DVD.</p>
<p>Compared to their breakthrough second album, <i>\xC1gætis Byrjun</i>, last year's <i>( )</i> was beautiful but     unsurprising, parts of it even turgid.   Toning down <i>\xC1gætis Byrjun</i>'s near-excesses and orchestral     embellishments, its grey palette and heavy mood were as exciting as watching ice not melt: it was solid,     but unpersuasive.  And so the single featured here, ""Untitled #1"" (aka ""Vaka""), has to disappoint a little.</p>
<p>True, it's exquisite, and the melody's flawless, borne on a thick but tingling organ with Jón \xFEor Birgisson's     near-whistling vocals augmented by a stately piano on one side and wisps of synth on the other.  Most bands     can only sound this graceful by whispering, or feigning delicacy; Sigur Rós muster the effect with an iron     fist, every detail aggressively beautiful.  But to hold it up again to a near-impossible standard, the song     lacks the freshness and expanse of their breakthrough single, ""Svefn-G-Englar"".  Gone are the woofer-trembling     echoes of glaciers shifting, forgotten is that impulse to pull over the car, roll down the windows and cry.     The song sounds internal and contained, somber and complete; it's incredibly pretty, but is that all there is?</p>
<p>""Untitled #9"", on the other hand, makes a pretty tight B-side.  It reportedly started as a remix of ""Vaka"",     before the band stretched and reworked it beyond recognition.  In its the first section, the trumpet, vocals     and synths loop around and speed to a high pitch.  These elements lilt and revolve until a final high-pitched     natter kicks off a quieter section, which drifts down to a single slow, moaning tone, joined gradually by     a higher one-- like whale pillow talk.</p>
<p>Although cut across three tracks on the disc, ""Untitled #9"" has to be judged as a whole, with the more     insubstantial second and third tracks making a tail-wagging-the-dog fade-out from the first.  If it weren't     twelve minutes long, you'd call it a miniature; it's as charmingly mechanical as a music box that quietly     breaks as it plays.</p>
<p>Anyone who bought last month's version of this single went home with just the music disc; to make those     people feel like suckers, MCA released the expanded edition this week for about the same price-- it comes     with a DVD.  Off the bat, I was disappointed in the no-frills presentation of this disc, which scores a fat     0.0 for extras.  You don't get the ""Making Of"" mini-documentary for ""Svefn-G-Englar"". You can't switch on     subtitles in Hopelandish, Icelandic or Hidden Peoplespeak.  There's no wacky backstage footage of Birgisson     practicing e-bow on the can in his boxers.  You just get the three videos.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that all three run in slow motion, and that the imagery's muted and beautiful.     As for the content, the messages are, well, blunt. ""Viðrar Vel Til Loftárása"" opens with a shot of a young     boy playing with two beat-to-shit dolls, and he's later assaulted by a homophobic welder and a Bible-hefting     priest.  ""Svefn-G-Englar"" features Iceland's Perlan Theater Group, a group of actors with Downs Syndrome,     dressed as angels.  But neither of them conks you harder than Italo-Canadian filmmaker Floria Sigismondi's ""Untitled     #1"", which sends a bunch of kids out for recess in a post-nuclear wasteland of black snow, red sky and poisoned     air.  A pack of them smash the hell out of a car while wearing old-fashioned gasmasks, evoking the kind of     apocalyptic imagery that doesn't even bother to look futuristic and cool.</p>
<p>""Untitled #1"" is too Terry Gilliam-lite for my tastes, but the two others-- co-directed by Sigur Rós     themselves-- have grown on me.  They're enjoyable half for their regional charm, and half because they match     the band's slow romanticism and implicit political edge.  Both were shot against the now-iconic landscape of     Iceland, green fields under overcast skies with craggy rock in the background; and from the choreography     and costumes of the Perlan Theater Group, to the great plot twist in ""Viðrar Vel Til Loftárása"", the videos     are as subtle and engaging as the songs.  And they both end with killer kisses.  For this band, what could     be more appropriate?</p></div>"|11826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11826-sigur-1sigur-9-ep/|7.1|Chris Dahlen

But they did go-- not to Trenchtown, to 
    one of those nice resorts near the Jamaican golf course. Did they have a good time? ""Everyone expects a handout down there, they all want money,"" they laughed. ""'Aye mon,' all holding out 
    their hands, 'Jammin,' mon.'""</p><p>
    Since a request for killer collie from these cultural ambassadors was out of the question, I asked them to bring me back a melodica. I packed her a picture of Augustus Pablo for reference and tried 
    to explain how, using a plastic child's toy, he had produced some of the most beatific breaths ever imbibed by the ears, leading folks as disparate as Tortoise, Damon 
    Albarn, and Pole to send their mums out for one as well.</p><p>
    Initial concerns about the interchangeability between tracks faded away as I let this latest culling of rare sides spin, endlessly. Instead I was struck by the truth of possibilities that 
    come to the fore. Put together by the British reggae reissue label Pressure Sounds (also responsible for last year's equally exquisite Pablo set, <i>El Rockers</i>), these side by side tracks 
    showcase the playing of Pablo and a pool of folks like the Barrett Brothers, ""Chinna"" Smith, and Robbie Shakespeare, laying out in consecutive versions a phenomenon that even 
    Shrödinger could get with: each version of a riddim splits into different realities, elucidated on apiece by the players in their dubs.</p><p>
    It opens up with five different versions of ""Far East"", done under such interchangeable names as Pablo All Stars and Rockers All Stars. The first one focuses on the melodica, allowing it to move 
    through the brass section laconically. In ""Phillip's Showcase"", the brass head gets dropped soon after the opening, and the pumping organs of bass and drum are revealed in all their pulsing 
    glory; returning later as ""East Man Sound"", there are extra percussive shakes and a quivering keyboard that warps the melody beautifully, leading into even more-- you guessed it-- melodica. The 
    fourth version drops in more hi-hat and cavernous rattles, before cutting into a more Hi-Fi take midway through, weaving another Pablo solo into the expanding guitar and organ.</p><p>
    Then there's the stretch of Jah Levi's ""False Rumour"", ""Zambian Style"" by Rockers All-Stars, and the ""Rockers Rock (Version)"" by Jah Iny near the end of the disc. The DJ on the first cut is heavily 
    Rastafarian in theme, but his voice gets reverberated on the follow-up, the rhythm permeating the mix, making everything shake with low frequencies. Everything is tweaked beyond 
    recognition on the last version, as Pablo switches up the bass line, stretches the organ like salty taffy, and has the tape-rewind run through an ever-shifting echo that destabilizes their 
    dub into a new element.  It's the most overtly weird slice here, the concentration being more on Pablo's touch behind the boards as well as in front of the microphone.</p><p>
    But to only view the surface of Pablo's music is to miss out on the fact that beneath the seeming simplicity of three minute instrumentals lies a complex set of relationships, between 
    the drum and bass, the stabs of organ and yardbird guitar, the temporal space between each hit, and how his serpentine lines on melodica and/or organ slide about on waves of 
    probability, leaving ripples in the ether. For its limited scope, this is not a bad souvenir of the man.</p></div>"|6124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6124-in-fine-style-original-rockers-7-and-12-selection-1973-1979/|7.9|Andy Beta

    the peace of minds everywhere.  Over the course of 25 years, folks have learned
    to beware their eccentricities, as all the while their many heirs sprawl about
    like prodigal idiot savants.  We don't need to fear this gruesome family: Nurse
    with Wound, Coil, Biota, Current 93-- one and all can make messes to their hearts'
    content as wholesome rock 'n' roll innocents need merely to shift eyes over the
    rows of these bands' records in shops.  Because no matter what unbalanced commotion
    these groups enact, very little makes its way into the heartland of our great nation,
    right?  Deviant collage and Dadaism may wreak havoc on the marginal audience attuned
    to its effects, but they are nonetheless marginal.</p><p>
    
    Or are they?  Mr. Michael Patton runs a fairly successful indie label featuring bands
    that perform along the hallowed parameters of The Residents and NWW (and his own A-list
    bizarro unit Mr. Bungle), and his roster receives considerable coverage in our corners
    (yep, check today's review of Kaada's <i>Thank You for Giving Me Your Valuable Time</i>).
    Elsewhere, labels such as Ata Tak and Beta-Lactam Ring prove that no matter how far out
    you get, there's always room to stretch.  So, let's be serious: Avant-garde rock is not
    tucked away in the corner of Chicago art schools, nor is it merely the refuge of nocturnal
    drug experimentalists with a penchant for art-damage and enough eBay money to pay for
    their Pro-Tools.  It has, in fact, long since crept into seemingly normal neighborhoods.
    The duo Samus, for example, are from Eastern, Pennsylvania.</p><p>
    
    Jeff Gallagher and John Busher aim to please, or scare, or possibly just tickle each other
    with their debut, <i>Desengano</i>.  With minimal assistance, in the span of just over 70
    minutes, they manage to deconstruct as much of the workaday sludge metal and tape-splicing
    gumbo as you'd expect for any band of self-dubbed ""oddballs.""  And with that description,
    they tread the well-worn path of understatement and anonymity so revered by Resident-ial
    family of noisemakers.  I'm no traditionalist, but I can admire the strength of musical
    lineage, especially when it's so ostensibly undernourished.  It's too bad Samus sound so
    much like <i>Disco Volante</i>-era Bungle.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there's no crime in sounding similar to other bands, but as all of the bands I
    referenced above can take considerable pride in sounding almost nothing like each other,
    Samus', well... sameness does strip <i>Desengano</i> of some much-needed edge. ""DJ Delta
    Burke"" goes through quite a backlog of late-night cable television blaxploitation movies
    and educational program sound-bites as narrative for its Casio-powered rhythm box beats
    and boogie-woogie piano samples.  It's interesting when the textures change in rapid
    succession, but over the course of ten minutes, the gag wears thin.  Similarly, ""The Happy
    Sultan"" wears its Melvins metal-dirge and Patton-ted screaming maniac vocals badges
    slightly too frequently to qualify as tribute.  I'll add that the production is great, in
    a lo-fi, stoned-out kind of way.</p><p>
    
    Predictably, the best moments happen when Samus ventures away from realms already extensively
    mined by their elders, as on the outstanding version of Duke Ellington's ""Caravan"" (here
    titled ""Super-Orthepedic [sic] Caravan"").  They use a 50s Hollywood orchestra sample
    saturated with disembodied soprano goodness as the intro to a cheap synth-and-cocktail
    lounge groove fit for the finest kings of space-age poppy-delia.  Furthermore, they pull
    out the psycho-sludge riffs at the end, and rather than numb my brain into submission,
    actually inject a little muscle into the mix.  Nice stuff, and what's more, they accomplish
    it in less than half the time of most of the other tunes on the disc.  I wouldn't say
    brevity is a prerequisite for serving up a particularly potent slice of abnormality, but
    in Samus' case, distilling the experience helps them to break free from the pack.</p></div>"|6994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6994-desengano/|5.9|Dominique Leone

    hearing two solo albums and one collaboration, it seems clear that he
    doesn't like to repeat himself. He moves easily between moods and textures,
    from spacious ambient plucking to abrasive drones, and at this premature
    stage in my exploration of his discography, his truly experimental style is
    still difficult to pin down.</p><p>
    
    This gorgeously packaged album contains a full live set, 40 minutes or so,
    recorded in Holland in 2001, along with a seven-inch EP containing two ""remakes""
    by Tom Recchion. Sounds are by Ambarchi alone, using his guitar augmented by
    some basic processing and electronics. The show was presumably in a gallery
    or theater, because the vast pockets of space that Ambarchi leaves between
    the notes (especially on the first side) are filled by silence alone. No
    background noise is detected.</p><p>
    
    The calm is important, as Ambarchi's preferred technique on the A-side is
    to move between a small handful of tones, where he plucks a single guitar
    string and lets the sound slowly decay alongside prickly electric scrapes
    and pops. He alternates between a half-dozen or so notes, with silence
    predominating in the early going and sounds congregating into progressively
    dense clusters as time passes.</p><p>
    
    Because of the seemingly random movement
    between the small set of pitches, the first side is oddly reminiscent of
    wind chimes, sounding like a peculiar amplified version of a hanging clutch
    of tubular bells. There's a sensation that something other than two hands is
    causing the notes to sound, some silent and unknowable force setting things
    in motion and then moving in and around the vibrations. Because the music is
    still surprising and unpredictable after ten spins, <i>Triste</i> makes for
    excellent repeated listening.</p><p>
    
    Both the sound and approach changes on the second side. It definitely starts
    where the piece left off, but the tempo is accelerated and more urgent, and
    sub-bass drones intrude and then take over almost immediately. The crackling
    taps that accompanied the drawn-out notes remains, but slowly shifting
    layers of sound and feedback are the focus. The rumbling bottom end combined
    with nasally, flanged harmonics bring to mind a chorus of didgeridoos, and
    then the midrange swells imparts the sonority of dueling sine waves. In the
    piece's final half, wild electronic tones untraceable to a guitar bang in
    and out, buzzing around the space like large sheet metal insects.</p><p>
    
    Where the first side left ample space for contemplation, allowing the listener
    to make a minute dissection of each sound, the harshly textured blasts come and
    go far more quickly by the end of the show than they can be processed.  <i>Triste</i>
    goes from <i>Thursday Afternoon</i>-style ambience to Mego-ish noise, and then,
    for a minute or two at the very end, back again. It's a mesmerizing ride.</p><p>
    
    The remakes by Recchion are excellent. Ambarchi's bell-like tones are
    prominent, but rather than focusing on a particular aspect of the original
    piece, Recchion uses the material to construct something new. Playing
    against the seeming randomness of Ambarchi's pieces, Recchion adds anchoring
    drones and sequences, thereby softening the material and making it more
    conventionally musical. Recchion's treatments are deeply affecting, occasionally
    even bordering on the sentimental, which is amazing considering the coolly
    removed nature of the source. All in all, <i>Triste</i> is a deeply satisfying
    exploration of abstract sound.</p></div>"|151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/151-triste/|7.8|Mark Richardson

You're sound asleep.  Suddenly, the phone rings and all the sweet, sweet
    serotonin gets sucked straight from your brain in a mere instant.  So now you're awake, but you're too
    tired to get up and answer the phone.  The machine picks up, and someone on the other end starts plucking
    a guitar and singing in a vaguely creepy, almost gender neutral tenor.  It's bone-chilling in the darkness.
    When it's over you struggle back into fitful, paranoid sleep, and in the morning when you wake up, the
    message is there.  After several listens, you still don't know who it is, but the song is starting to make
    sense.  It's actually pretty good.</p><p>
    
    Devendra Banhart's music ingratiates itself to you like this.  His simple songs-- typically two, maybe
    three chords, one acoustic guitar, and his shaky, freakish vocals layered on top-- have an archaic, almost
    primitive feel to them that's utterly otherwordly, and yet strangely, deeply American.  Harry Smith would
    have heard treasure here, and Banhart's output shares a lot of ground with the <i>Smithsonian Anthology of
    American Folk Music</i>'s creakiest selections.  Plus, it sounds like it was recorded on an answering
    machine, engulfed in hiss and night sounds.</p><p>
    
    That's somewhat by design, of course, at least as far as the actual releases of this mini-album (eight songs
    in 23 minutes) and his first full-length (2002's <i>Oh Me Oh My</i>) are concerned.  Young God Records honcho
    and erstwhile Swan/meanwhile Angel of Light Michael Gira first heard Banhart via a rough demo that came in
    the mail and couldn't bring himself to have the kid come into the studio to polish the songs up.  He felt
    that they sounded pretty well perfect as they were, and he was right-- it's hard to imagine these songs
    presented with any amount of gloss.</p><p>
    
    The story goes that young Devendra was always recording these songs for himself on cheap recording devices
    and had to be convinced by friends and family to send them around to labels.  The result is an uncanny honesty
    and open imperfection to the songs that would be impossible to capture in a studio.  ""Cosmos and Delos"" is
    ink black and spare, with skeletal guitar figures and what sounds like a distant gunshot and street noise
    in the background.  Banhart sings with himself in extremely close harmony, creating melody out of a near-drone.</p><p>
    
    Banhart proves himself an able guitarist on ""Lagoon"", filling in the melodic gaps with gorgeous, cascading
    lines.  The lyrics are almost inscrutably obtuse, with strange non-sequiturs like ""Never been to Minnesota/
    Still I'd love to live in Maine/ Never been to Salamanca/ Still I'd love to live in Spain"".  ""The Charles
    C. Leary"" is my favorite lyrically, detailing a series of surreal, dreamlike vignettes of a possible
    shipwreck.  ""I lost the gloves my mother gave me/ While on the way to the make believe sea,"" he intones over
    a bobbing guitar part-- the song throbs and sways with seasickness, speeding up and slowing down as befits
    the urgency of each respective verse.</p><p>
    
    Though it can be thoroughly engrossing, it bears noting that Banhart's music is decidedly not for everyone.
    If the sounds of the backwoods-- real or imagined-- appeal to you, Banhart will give you chills in the best
    way possible; if you're more into polish and can't stomach the deeply surreal, caution is definitely in
    your best interest.  Still, Banhart is a singular talent, and if he hits you right, you'll be only too happy
    to be held in his thrall.</p></div>"|547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/547-the-black-babies-ep/|7.7|Joe Tangari

It's also
    always sad to see a critic drone on and on about his youthful experiences in order to set up an emotional
    context for his admonishments.  This review will contain plenty of both, so be forewarned.</p><p>
    The Figgs hold a special place in my heart, simply through the serendipity of being the opening act at my
    first concert.  Okay, not my very first concert (that'd be Kenny Loggins with the 'rents)... alright, not
    even the first concert chosen under my own volition (that'd be Aerosmith and Megadeth, also with the fam
    in tow)... okay, not my first concert without parental supervision either (that'd be Soundgarden and Tad).
    But let's call it the first show that had any sort of bearing on my subsequent listening habits: The Poster
    Children and The Figgs at Chicago's fine Cabaret Metro.</p><p>
    With the naïve exuberance of a high school freshman not yet allergic to the limited returns of opening acts,
    The Figgs were pure joy: they were loud!  Fast!  Jumped around!  Had songs about ice cream!  Maniacally
    unencumbered by familial chaperones, I celebrated like a mid-90s teenager should: crowd-surfing!  Moshing!
    After the show, I eagerly scooped up a copy of the band's <i>Lo-Fi at Society High</i>, and went on to
    treasure it like any kid who thinks he's found a band only <i>he</i> knows about.</p><p>
    Holy name of Jesus!  It's been ten years since those innocent days, and look at how things have changed.  A
    decade later, I'm a little more informed and a lot more cynical, and while <i>Lo-Fi</i> (and its not-bad
    successor <i>Banda Macho</i>) still sounds good, I can recognize that the songs within were little more
    than sped-up Elvis Costello ripoffs.  A decade later, The Figgs are probably a little more cynical, too,
    having been victimized by a number of label restructurings (including Capitol Records'), endured the loss
    of a member, and now, ended up on tiny Boston-based Hearbox Records.</p><p>
    Or at least it would seem that way, as <i>Slow Charm</i> opens with Pete Donnelly declaring, ""I'll never go
    back to being that way.""  Yet, it seems like the changes they've made since I last encountered them have all
    been of subtraction, as The Figgs incarnation here sounds rather caffeine-free compared to the sugar-high
    act of old.  Minus the fast tempos and punchy rhythms, Donnelly's voice is left astonishingly bland on his
    share of the songs-- ""Static"" and ""The Trench"" are unpleasantly MOR-friendly.  Doubles partner Mike Gent
    fares better, his peculiar, acrid voice still intact, but with more mature subject matter replacing the
    lovelornaments of the past, it's put to waste on spineless material like ""Protocol"".</p><p>
    Of course, I don't expect The Figgs to still be throwing down spittle-spraying material like ""Favorite
    Shirt"" as they ease over the hill, but what passes for growth here is less than promising.  ""Metal Detector""
    is proud of its theremin overdubs but ultimately limp, while the two-chord ""Soon"" cuts a weak swagger, its
    bargain wah-pedal and senseless organ noodling making it sound something my jamband-polluted high school
    would've regurgitated.</p><p>
    The majority of <i>Slow Charm</i> displays pop that has traded in the ""power-"" prefix of old for a more
    mature ""-rock"" suffix, leaving the sterile end product sounding less like The Buzzcocks and more like Bryan
    Adams.  And while the band still offers up a couple catchy keyhole glimpses of their earlier spirit (""Sit
    and Shake"", ""Public Transportation""), The Figgs sound like Band #35,873 that's existed long past their
    expiration date.  'Tis a harsh sentence to pass on the band who taught me how to mosh, but unfortunately
    for The Figgs, we're all a bit older and less excitable these days.</p></div>"|3052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3052-slow-charm/|4.8|Rob Mitchum

    artistry by taking up soft-lead pencils and doing artistic renderings of all my favorite albums. I started
    off with some white sleeve promos and gradually worked my way through <i>The Beatles</i> and <i>TNT</i>.
    I'm cramping a little bit on Rudimentary Peni's <i>Death Church</i> and Terry Riley's <i>Poppy Nogood and
    the Phantom Band All Night Flight</i>, but the icepacks are doing wonders.</p><p>
    
    At the last International Starving Artist's Swap Meet at Joe Freeman Coliseum, I started trading with the
    Berthling brothers, Johan and Andreas, and their Swedish buddy, Tomas Hallonsten. The three called themselves
    Tape and wrote out the title of their latest creation as <i>Opera</i>, the graphite tactile on an exquisitely
    textured paper.  They do a mighty nice rendition of the pastoral plucking and counter-current circuitry
    of Faust's <i>IV</i>, I must say, in addition to the charcoal cubism of Gastr del Sol's <i>Camofleur</i>,
    done without any sort of preciousness that can hang over such electronic and acoustic rubbings.</p><p>
    
    ""Bell Mountain"" opens with chiming guitar strings and a processed gurgle echoing from deep inside the wood,
    an elegant contrast between the two aforementioned albums. ""Return to Ship"" traces the beautiful figures of
    <i>Five Leaves Left</i>, with warm feedback drifting through those Drake-draped branches like an arctic sun.
    When the harmonica comes in, the weird objects drawn on the front cover-- including curiously curled leaves,
    stones, and plant life-- recall the world tree on Talk Talk's <i>Laughing Stock</i> in their more amorphous
    states of sound, before the voice of Mark Hollis would enter. ""Longitude"" drifts in and out of percolating
    rainfall, breathing harmonium breezes, and metallophones, perfectly matching yet another gray, washed-out,
    still-not-summer weekend outside.</p><p>
    
    What's perhaps their most awe-inspiring cover adaptation is that they capture the family vacation photo
    processing of Fennesz's <i>Endless Summer</i>. With an instrumental list that includes guitar, harmonium,
    laptop, field recordings, zither, piano, flute, glockenspiel, accordion, trumpet, and styrofoam, to name
    but a few, they move between the two extremes of unadulterated sound and sound processing. Tracks like
    ""Feeler"" and ""Radiolaria"" will be familiar to anyone already enamored with ""Caecilia"" or ""Shisheido"". While
    the guitar ambles along, moving in a drawn-out fashion that can be a little bit too extended, little sound
    events puff and gust around it, sometimes sympathetic and subdued, other times randomly contrasting with
    the melodic figures and standing out, the colors of all the various instruments vibrant even when mixed
    together.</p><p>
    
    Culling such deeply nuanced and singular sounds as the quoted covers above, Tape, while evoking brief
    instances of recollected sounds, manage to carve out a distinct, albeit more mild space of their own,
    drawing forth the most distinct elements and reworking it as their specific, spacious sound.</p></div>"|7937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7937-opera/|7.6|Andy Beta

Usually, the explanations I
    come up with include higher printing costs and a desire for artistic esotericism. In the case of Alpinestars,
    I believe the answer to lie in the fact that their lyrics are simply not great-- to the extent that they could,
    at times, pass for an awkward kind of sci-fi poetry.  Witness: ""You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram.""
    Or Placebo's Brian Molko singing, ""No time or space in the city"" in a forced sneer attempt to drive home the
    fact that this band is making MUSIC that THINKS about the FUTURE!!!!</p><p>
    
    Alpinestars play modern, trance-y synth-pop with zero edge and melodies with zero hook, which everyone knows
    are the two key elements synth-pop bands revolve around in the first place.  The couple tracks that are sort
    of decent-- like ""Snow Patrol (Part 1)"", which combines screaming synths with a techno beat, or ""NuSEX City"",
    whose dorky, <i>NOVA</i>-oh-shit!-check-this-trippy-keyb-line self-wonderment is countered by a fairly tite
    disco jam-- are sullied with the kinds of vocal effects placed over the nasal yawl of Britney Spears and all
    her teen pop progenies. Even the ""Bobby Peru's Electrostar Edit"" remix of ""Carbon Kid"", which adeptly plunges
    itself into snappy, almost experimental, hot electro tweaks, is sullied by the Hi-NRG style splicing of Molko's
    cheesy vocals over the only good synth melody on the record. Plus effects.</p><p>
    
    But okay, by ""Brotherhood"", which is track 7 out of 12 and shamefully rips its melody of unquestioning
    happiness from ""Here Comes the Sun"", you'll be longing for the tracks that sound swiped from U2's <i>Zooropa</i>.
    Elsewhere, inspiration seems desperately plucked from such dicey sources as The Soup Dragons and <i>Give Out
    But Don't Give Up</i>-era Primal Scream (as on ""Hotel Parallel""), or are stolen outright from, say, New
    Order's ""Temptation"" (as on ""Burning Up"").  Now, normally I wouldn't be so careless about wanton name-dropping
    and comparison-making, but merely imagining the music that inspired Alpinestars is far more interesting than
    Alpinestars' actual record.</p><p>
    
    I don't know who listens to this antiseptic electro-pop, or how they can distinguish it from any of the
    other insipid dance-schlock that DJ Neiman Marcus spins while they compare Kate Spade bags at the upscale
    boutiques on Madison Avenue, but I know this: IT'S FUCKING HELL.  If I want to listen to the Pet Shop Boys
    I'll put on Magnetic Fields.</p></div>"|134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/134-white-noise/|2.9|Julianne Shepherd

    shoulders, guitars over our heads.  And one time we wrapped blankets around our heads, played as loudly
    as possible on his porch, and commenced battle with the invisible army of neighboring bugs.  Our guitars
    blended into and supplemented their chirps.  There was a night we snuck to a barely paved fire road and
    rubbed carrots back and forth in the dirt; and though I'm vegan, I once mic'd a pork chop and later used
    the otherworldly scrapes of the meat as a minor-key percussion track.  These exercises were each an attempt
    to locate previously undisclosed sounds, to move beyond standard instrumentation.  It was through these
    sorts of things that I learned how to tilt an acoustic guitar against a hand-held recorder for feedback,
    and realized that twisting my body a bit to the left made the same strings a muted whisper.</p><p>
    
    On their third album, <i>We Walked the Young Earth</i>, San Francisco-based Jewelled Antler stalwarts Glenn
    Donaldson and Loren Chasse, obvious disciples of the above tenets, construct an aural topography using
    complexly geographic-based recording techniques.  Recorded last summer in a World War II-era bunker in
    the Marin Headlands and under a creek bridge in San Gregario, <i>We Walked the Young Earth</i> picks up
    where 2001's achingly ephemeral <i>Waves of Grass</i> left off.  Here, however, the duo forges the din of
    acoustic guitar, harp, bells, harmonium, toy amplifiers, gongs (submerged in a creek), battery-powered
    keyboards, vocals, banjo, birds, pipes, bell-blocks, drums, and branches into even quieter spaces of beauty.
    The best comparisons might be Flying Saucer Attack and Richard Youngs collaborating on an unplugged psych
    meditation, a tree-bound Calvino-inspired Ghost with even more droning patience, a restive California-style
    International Harvester, Sun City Girls when they drone the Eastern thing, or a stretched-out This Kind of
    Punishment minus the rusted baritone.</p><p>
    
    On ""The Book of Names"", Donaldson's wistful vocalizations seem like invocations to various forestland gods.
    ""The Oldest Living Things"" is built within bubbling water and a cricket solo.  Throughout the album, wind
    chimes are raised to the level of art, distant whispering seems like an animal call, and wind ominously
    sounds like anything but wind.  ""All Children's Faces Looking Upwards"" is guitar-based psych with the rusted
    crumble of a gong scraping the background.  Interestingly, on the album as a whole, percussion seems like a
    series of tasks and rarely functions as a backbeat.</p><p>
    
    ""Green Patterns"" is more claustrophobic than the others: Notes on a guitar are tapped and chiseled, a load
    of percussion drips and clatters, and analog feedback hums; a shift brings the percussion more to the fore,
    and evokes a ghost dragging its chains through the dead leaves of the forest floor.  Tones resonate, and
    are drawn out endlessly.  And the final bit, the title track, is reminiscent of <i>ECIM</i>-era Cul-De-Sac:
    a last-gasp falsetto, strings are plucked, bells are shaken towards a nighttime sky, an underlying sadness
    remains.  I imagine The Blithe Sons leaving their instruments in place for a year and returning each season
    to see what's written upon them.  How would these pieces sound with so much more history and decay, the
    freeform structures and striations of passing sediment?</p><p>
    
    The sense of place on <i>We Walk the Young Earth</i> is affecting, the care taken in capturing naturally
    occurring sounds admirable.  Some bits aren't as strong as others (the drones do sometimes drone), but the
    constant reciprocity between the players and their instinctive interaction with the environment is
    damn-near breathtaking.  If you listen carefully enough to these recordings, which were set to the rhythm
    of a particular environment, their expansive sounds in turn consume the patterns of your space, creating
    an endlessly dense hymn that leaks and breathes into the city around you.</p></div>"|801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/801-we-walk-the-young-earth/|8.4|Brandon Stosuy

It's been the central thematic
    tension of the 21st century thus far, and countless indie bands have exploited (some mercilessly) the
    discord generated by mixing organic and machine-made elements within their songs, building friction and
    malcontent through the juxtaposition.  For a lot of bands, this means combining acoustic guitars,
    synthesizers and Brian Deck; for Grandaddy, man vs. machine is separate aesthetic principle entirely--
    one that has far less to do with music than with the imminent fate of our universe.</p><p>
    On 2000's <i>The Sophtware Slump</i>, Grandaddy were radically pessimistic, a band droopingly resigned to
    humanity's relative uselessness in the face of gnashing, impeding technology; it was a stance that kicked
    open the gates for lots of <i>OK Computer</i>-aligning and gobs of millennial anxiety/robot nightmares.
    The idea of calculated perfection overtaking goofy human error is some awfully scary shit-- mostly because
    our potential futility is such a perfectly plausible concern.  Consequently, <i>The Sophtware Slump</i> was
    a chillingly foreboding record, both intellectually and aurally frightening: it was peppered with moments of
    pure sonic brilliance (""He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot"") but ultimately burdened by its own dark,
    apocryphal apprehensions.</p><p>
    Three years later, <i>Sumday</i> glows. While it might feel oddly recognizable to some (please insert
    requisite Radiohead/Pavement/Sparklehorse reference here), <i>Sumday</i>'s dim, protracted familiarity has
    far more to do with the band's sudden character shift than their occasionally questionable ingenuity.  The
    déjà vu here is internal: <i>Sumday</i> sounds vaguely like Grandaddy.</p><p>
    Pastoral, sanguine, and oddly buoyant, the album is far less sinister (and certainly less adventurous) than
    Grandaddy's former studio experiments, but still comes complete with its own curious set of demands: the
    first six songs are strikingly (and, presumably, deliberately) similar in timing, tone and strum.  Luckily,
    the band avoids the sameness that often comes with such a consecutive string of spacious midtempo pop songs;
    instead, the effect is a dreamily cohesive half-hour of music, the perfect extended metaphor, a big warm
    blanket to curl up in and chew on.</p><p>
    Thematically, not too much has changed: Grandaddy seem to be actively pigeonholing themselves as a band
    preoccupied, at least lyrically, with the encroachment of mean, blank-faced technology.  <i>Sumday</i>,
    fortunately, sees the band employing a more laughably absurdist bent (which, I suppose, could have arisen
    from the tragic-- or hilarious, or irrelevant-- irony that The Flaming Lips have actually already made a
    very similar record), tackling our collective defeat with a few more giggles and spits.  Futuristic apparatus
    were once apocalyptic-- now they're borderline silly. Computers and sprinkler systems are boldly personified
    as nervous and insecure rather than silently destructive.  Desktops cry out bleeps of lonely despair when
    no one's around, robots are left in the dark, and, occasionally, vocalist Jason Lytle decides to embody the
    mechanized other.</p><p>
    In the tellingly titled ""I'm on Standby"", a bot is banished to a shivery tech services lab, where he glumly
    laments his malfunctions: ""According to the work order you signed/ I'll be down for some time.""  Meanwhile,
    humans are reduced to fumbling idiots when denied the shiny trappings of industrialization. ""The Group Who
    Couldn't Say"" features a cast of improbable entrepreneurs who, when faced with a day in the countryside,
    slowly self-destruct (""She kinda lost her shoes/ And lost her mind/ And smashed her phone upon a fallen
    pine"").</p><p>
    Lytle's airy tenor is alarmingly tranquil, and its calmness can be oddly affecting: when he asks, blankly,
    ""Are you happy with what you're doing?"" in ""The Group Who Couldn't Say"" it's almost impossible not to pause
    and reboot; simplistic sentiments aside, his always-honest, unwavering voice is resonant enough to inspire
    some serious self-assessment.</p><p>
    When the project finally shifts out of its opening haze (exactly halfway through-- ah, vinyl!), <i>Sumday</i>'s
    soundscape suddenly goes big, fuzzy, and dramatic.  Things also get a bit more warm-blooded. ""Yeah Is What
    We Had"" is <i>Sumday</i>'s triumphant (if unexpected) return to heart-pumping, fleshy reality, a distorted,
    spectral love song fat with shimmer and regret: when Lytle howls, ""In this life/ Will I ever see you again?""
    it's unbearably clear that the man's not addressing his iBook.</p><p>
    ""OK with My Decay"" nails the most palpable of human sensations-- fear of mortality-- with frank, wistful
    piano, thick bass, and swelling synths.  Here, Lytle goes sad-eyed: ""I'm OK/ With my decay/ I have no
    choice.""  Ignore the obtuse lyrics and realize it's hard to get more lifelike (or more heartbreakingly
    honest) than freaking out about your foreseeable demise.</p><p>
    After enduring years of (yawn) useless Radiohead comparisons, Grandaddy have, ironically, created an album
    that's fundamentally antithetical to the record their contemporaries are scheduled to release on the same
    day-- rather than embracing experimentalism and cold calculation as substantive art, Grandaddy have gone
    soft in a way that's far more satisfying (and, to an extent, more compelling) than their detached past,
    where the band tended to miss more free throws than Tim Duncan.  They've still got their clever
    title-spellings, and more than one set of lyrics featuring an operating system, but <i>Sumday</i> is all
    glorious, throbbing heart.</p></div>"|3544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3544-sumday/|8.1|Amanda Petrusich

    me, nearly becoming quaint.  It was my first and last heavy metal concert, a Relapse Records showcase on the
    outskirts of Brooklyn.  I don't remember what I'd expected my curiosity to yield that evening, but mere
    seconds after the house lights dimmed, amidst a pit of writhing bodies dancing violently to Cephalic
    Carnage's blistering rendition of ""Jesus Saves""-- a setting in which leather is preferred to denim, and
    quiet introspection will get your teeth kicked in-- I was privy to a blaring personal revelation: I did
    not belong there.</p><p>
    Being acclimated to a more passive absorption of the music that was now being presented on stage in deafening
    megadecibels, I was ill-prepared for the engaging and brutal nature of metal-- this unreadiness stemming not
    only from my being a coward (which I am), but also from my unfamiliarity with a parallel, yet decidedly
    foreign, subculture.</p><p>
    Philadelphia's Dysrhythmia is a band unplagued by any similar fear of genre-crossing, as they seek to prove
    that the door is capable of swinging at least one way with their recent album, <i>Pretest</i>.  Outfitting
    elements of Relapse's signature metal and grind-core sound with post-rock's jazz-influenced complexity,
    Dysrhythmia have created a collection of instrumental tracks with contemporaneous comparisons drawn to Don
    Caballero, early Mogwai, and The Fucking Champs.  Overseen by Steve Albini, who has previously engineered
    projects by both Don Cab and Mogwai, the group nearly pulls off their fusion, forming a viable indie-by-way-of-metal
    hybrid that slumps only when it underestimates the range of the former through debased pride in the latter.</p><p>
    ""Running Shoe of Justice"" appropriately delivers a racing march upon which a borrowed Explosions in the Sky
    melody is layered before dissipating into a dissonant wall of feedback.  Similarly building off of a strongly
    percussive skeleton is ""Heat Sink"", a track that delivers on the band's roots with buzzsaw guitars accented
    by a fuzzy and dominating bass.  This heart of metal is deceptive, though, as a distinct pop-tune arises,
    bouncy in comparison to the dark and rapidly pulsing percussion that nearly buries it.</p><p>
    ""Annihilation"", the two-part centerpiece of the album, concurrently represents the musical peak, beginning
    with a beautiful upper-register guitar line that chills as it echoes against the bass drum that is itself
    inevitably immersed within the sparse background.  As the percussion increases with fits of Robert Wyatt-inspired
    furor, an approachable rhythm emerges that ultimately cascades into a more reliable beat.  Rapid bursts of
    energy alternately led by guitar and bass punctuate the remainder of the suite, with interjections finally
    giving way to the peaceful finale of light reverb followed by silence.</p><p>
    Merely having the moxie to attempt to build a bridge between the raw aggression of metal and the brooding
    intricacy of post-rock does not necessitate success, though, as evidenced by the tracks ""Catalog of Personal
    Faults"", ""And Just Go"", and ""My Relationship"".  Treading on shaky ground, the songs all manage to combine
    either the least interesting elements of both musical approaches or the most clichéd, resulting in frivolous
    exercises in one style or the other.  Proving the unhealthiness of excess, ""Touch Benediction"" sounds like
    a band falsely assuming an easy acceptance into the folds of instrumental indie rock, pushing a simple motif
    well past its welcome and ending the album on an extremely weak note.</p><p>
    A similar overconfidence could hypothetically compel a hardened New York metalhead to assume dominance in
    say, a Tortoise concert, or for that matter, Bright Eyes.  While the individual probably wouldn't experience
    any mortal fear, as one might at a Relapse Records showcase, he or she <i>would</i> feel the same level of
    discomfort and antipathy that the opposite situation prompted in me.  There are definitely bands that are
    capable of moving back and forth between the two poles, but, although Dysrhythmia rise to the challenge for
    a few wonderful moments, they don't show any real consistency at it here.  Instead, they often return to
    the safe-ground of one of the two genres throughout <i>Pretest</i>, and wind up alienating both of the
    scenes they were seeking to unite.</p></div>"|2503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2503-pretest/|6.9|Andrew Bryant

    to buy the group as many drinks as they could handle-- and from the sound of them that would have been quite
    a few.  ""Give me one more chance,"" drawly guy-singer sang, and chirpy girl-singer finished his thought: ""And
    you'll fuck up."" This is the main thing I remember about their record-- that it contained one of the better
    uses of parenthesis I've come across in a guitar-pop song. ""Give me one more chance (and you'll fuck up),""
    all matter-of-fact, like neither of them even felt like going through the motions.</p><p>
    
    There are a couple of Kiss-Offs in Black Lipstick, including drawly guy-singer Philip Niemeyer, and like
    you'd guess from the name, they're still kicking around the same pleather pants and beery make-out vibes
    as before. They can still nail down the parentheses, too. On ""Serpentz"", one of a few highlights here, some
    straggling backup vocals turn an oily compliment into a warning, because these guys are out to steal your
    girlfriend: ""No lady so lovely should be left alone. (With me.)""</p><p>
    
    They're clever like that. But the girlfriend's probably safe: these folks might get into beer, or trucks,
    but you just know they're cute little indie kids. One of them is a lawyer; it's not hard to imagine the
    others being grad students.</p><p>
    
    Which works out perfectly for them, cause it's surprising how good they sound. They live in this down-to-basics
    neighborhood that's a certain type of indie rock band's Home Base, which is to say that they sound like a lot
    of bands who sound like The Velvet Underground: the drums tick and shamble, the guitars scrape and jangle,
    and the singers drawl off-key about being broke, getting fucked up, and breaking up with people. (Just when
    I'd forgotten why it used to be cool for indie bands to sound like they were doing everything half-assed!)</p><p>
    
    Add in these guys' penchant for cute glammy details and the low-rent Texan good-time vibe gets pretty infectious: the idea
    of Black Lipstick playing anywhere but basements, barbecues, and dive bars seems sad and wrong. So they fret
    about being 27 and still getting excited about thrift-store finds; they get around on the city bus; they dream
    about getting back at bill collectors and luring old friends away from corporate day-jobs. They almost-- almost--
    manage to make me miss being broke, wearing dirty shorts, and forgetting what day it is.</p><p>
    
    It's about the voices more than the music, really. Niemeyer's got a lazy sing-speak that makes Lou Reed sound
    like the one with the affectations; he drawls so sly and husky that you can almost miss his one-liners. (What's
    remarkable is that he's still more expressive than the average yelper: at his best he beats even the knowing
    sing-song of Luna's Dean Wareham.) Guitar player Travis Higdon-- who lays sloppy hooks over Niemeyer's rhythm--
    takes the lead for a few tracks, covering the other indie-vocal mainstay: he's the sweetly warbly one. Drummer
    Elizabeth Nottingham, meanwhile, is the secret, tossing out the occasional deadpan lazy backup or just
    talking back and forth with Niemeyer: ""So, papi... you like it when I shake it?""</p><p>
    
    That's how they shamble through. Sometimes it's that lazy jangle, like on ""Voodoo Economics"". Sometimes
    Higdon breaks through for a snappy pop run, like on the perfect chorus of ""Serpentz"" or on ""Corporate Happy
    Hour"". Sometimes they sag down for the lazy head-nodders: ""Dirges are Downers"" and ""Hot Sinners"" seem like
    mumbling from under the covers, and it's at moments like these where the band seems most in danger of losing
    the plot. But they just as often hit it spot-on. ""Ease Back"" makes good on a few minutes of ultra-slack
    cruising when it, like, eases back, into some big guitar sweeps and Niemeyer's good-life fantasy: ""We're
    spending cash at malls/ And making booty calls."" Not to mention the nine-minute ""Texas Women"", which stops
    midway through for a long guitar break that explains how these guys bought some Sonic Youth records and
    liked a lot of the pretty parts.</p><p>
    
    The music is... well, don't expect to hear anything you haven't heard before, and don't expect to hear
    anything you've heard before done particularly better than the last time. Black Lipstick work mainly because
    of charm. This is the thing about the slacker-band Home Base: there are two reasons you might be spending
    time there. The best Home Base bands sound like they're rediscovering it-- jogging happily back to the plate
    after hitting a home run, giving the thumbs-up to a crowd that's getting what it knows it wants. The worst
    Home Base bands sound like they're just stuck there, striking out.</p><p>
    
    So this completely ruins the analogy,
    but Black Lipstick have sort of hit a triple: like their dreamier labelmates Palaxy Tracks, they've latched
    onto all of the loveable, slopped-up band-in-a-room realism of college bands around the turn of the 90s.
    That's not always enough, though, and <i>Converted Thieves</i> really does just sound like a half-assed
    record unless you feel like letting the details grow on you. And yeah, let's be clear: there's no excuse
    for another rock band that sounds this much like The Velvet Underground. But then again, it's supposedly
    summer, and if I could have any band over to play a house party...</p></div>"|769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/769-converted-thieves/|7.5|Nitsuh Abebe

And if his interviews are any
    indication, that one man is Reed himself.  His vaunted intellectualism has always afforded him a final,
    unbreachable line of defense when one of his albums is subjected to criticism-- I mean, who are <i>we</i>
    to detract from Lou Reed's epic vision?  We, the insipid, the shortsighted, could never truly grasp the
    depth of artistry that goes into even the most seemingly hackneyed tracks from <i>Ecstasy</i> (particularly
    that of ""Like a Possum""), to say nothing of the deep harmonic layering in <i>Metal Machine Music</i>.</p><p>
    ""If you had a small mind, you'd miss it.""</p><p>
    You said it, Lou.</p><p>
    ""I've been rewriting the same song for a long time.  Except my bullshit is worth other people's diamonds.
    And diamonds are a girl's best friend.""</p><p>
    See, only Lou Reed can criticize Lou Reed; fortunately, he has only the kindest things to say about himself.
    He's been maligned for not understanding what he does best, and inadvertently playing directly into his
    weaknesses as a result, but I'm more inclined to think that he just doesn't care what other people believe
    his perceived strengths to be.  It almost makes me wonder why he bothered at all to hand-select and remaster
    the 31 tunes included on <i>NYC Man</i>, especially when such effort has been made to include material from
    even (to my ""small mind"") the worst of his later work.</p><p>
    Here, studio versions of numerous mega-classics are replaced with live renditions, often denying listeners
    even that small pleasure of listening to these tracks with some small degree of studio clarity rather than
    stripped-down, emotionally dead reprises.  About the only unpleasantry he's spared us is sixteen minutes
    (and one second) of grating feedback-- er, I mean, deeply embedded classical melodies-- to represent
    <i>Metal Machine Music</i>.</p><p>
    Still, like any of the greatest Roman emperors and European monarchs knew, the wrath of the mob is something
    to be avoided, and so the King of NYC condescends to include basically all the songs that will send still
    send him to the front of the line when rock's judgment day arrives-- most of which appear as live versions.
    ""Sweet Jane""'s gloriously faded core progression is one of the single most ripped-off blasts in rock and roll;
    the harrowing epic ""Street Hassle"" still sets a standard in orchestral rock augmentation that few bands can
    even dream of approaching.  The transcendent helplessness of ""Caroline Says"", the sultry decadence of ""Walk
    on the Wild Side"", the sweet fuck-all of ""White Light/White Heat""-- all the songs that have been included
    on every other Lou Reed compilation are here, too.  In some sense, the decision to include live takes of
    many of these songs would be preferable to offering yet another studio copy of ""Heroin"", if only Reed's
    lackluster, ""I'd rather be anywhere else"" live performances didn't so consistently wither in comparison.</p><p>
    To give the man some deserved credit, though, it's hard to produce a ""bad"" version of a song as genuinely
    perfect as ""I'll Be Your Mirror""; it may be diminished here, but fundamentally, it remains one of the brightest
    jewels in rock's crown.  And so it is for all of Reed's most brilliant moments.  The bad news is, there's
    more here than just his most memorable work.  Now, to state that many of Lou's later albums are <i>awful</i>
    is certainly subjective on some level, but I sincerely doubt there's a person alive (well, aside from Lou)
    who'd be pleased with any collection that attempted to sum up his career by including <i>any</i>
    songs at all-- even just one, as this compilation does-- from rock-bottom tragedies like <i>Mistrial</i>,
    <i>Ecstasy</i>, and <i>The Raven</i>.  Unfortunately, after the necessary inclusions, that's about all he
    can do.</p><p>
    So, rather than excise ""Rock Minuet"", the studio-alternate of ""Who Am I"", or any of the other relatively
    uninspired works of his later albums, and focus instead on his equally incredible, but more commonly
    overlooked 80s work-- or shit, just limited this thing to one disc-- he wildly over-reaches.  All possible
    opportunities for cohesion have been denied here at the expense of the implicit notion that all Reed's work
    is created equal.  It ain't.</p><p>
    But you know what?  Lou really was a genius (maybe still is).  Even if his decisions make much of <i>NYC Man</i>
    a baffling ordeal, as albums go, the canonical rock and roll might contained in some of his greatest triumphs,
    even in second-rate form, save this album from the guillotine.  Such is the scope of his songwriting skill.
    This is Lou's career, all of it-- from The Velvets to <i>The Raven</i>-- as it could only make sense to him,
    3\xBD decades crammed into less than 3\xBD hours.  Take away any sort of chronology and then attempt to find
    representation from every release he ever crapped out, and all that's left is a strung-out, confusing mess
    that could have turned out a hell of a lot better than it did.  A hell of a lot like Lou, actually.</p></div>"|6734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6734-nyc-man-the-collection/|6.3|Eric Carr

I mean, Dylan's one
    thing, and I dig Paul Simon a lot, but none of the more modern crop of earnest songsmith-performers-- all
    these Mayers and Yorns and Colvins and DiFrancos and their coffeeshop successors waiting in the wings--
    aren't clicking with me.  Which is why I'm having a tough time understanding why I like Aroah so much.</p><p>
    Aroah, for the uninitiated, is the stage name of bilingual Spanish-American singer/songwriter Irene Tremblay.
    Maybe it's just the fact that she has a stage name that makes her more appealing, I don't know, but the
    layers of weirdness pile on when it becomes apparent from listening that Tremblay has probably taken in
    quite a lot of Ani DiFranco records-- though she never aspires to Ani's histrionics, musically or vocally.
    I really enjoyed Aroah's debut EP, <i>Cuando Termines Con Todo, Habrá Terminado Contigo EP</i>, and I
    actually think it's about one head and maybe two shoulders above its full-length follow up, <i>No Podemos
    Ser Amigos</i> (Español for ""We can't be friends"").</p><p>
    Part of the reason for the dip in quality is that Tremblay and her collaborators, who consist mostly of
    members of Spanish post-rock demigods Migala, have backed away somewhat from the deeply atmospheric sound
    that enveloped the EP, letting more songs dip into acoustic guitar and voice non-arrangements.  Mind you,
    there are still plenty of fantastically rich atmospheres here, they're just not continuous.</p><p>
    Tremblay is also a lot more demure and less accusatory that a lot of her peers, preferring to approach the
    failed romance that is her bread and butter from oblique angles.  And when she does rise to point a finger,
    as on ""The Biggest Idiot in the World"", she always remains equivocal, blaming herself as much for a relationship's
    little eruptions as much as her unnamed Other, ending on the telling line, ""We are a pair of the biggest
    idiots in the world.""  The biggest shift from her past lyrically is that only three of these songs are in
    Spanish, which is a much lower proportion than before.</p><p>
    On the musical front, the songs that most clearly echo her debut and broadcast the involvement of Migala
    are the most successful, beginning with opener ""Myriam, la Primera"", which is shrouded in dark, roomy drums
    and dribbly guitars.  There's even an instrumental, appropriately titled ""Canción Sin Palabras"", that allows
    the album's often moody backing tracks a chance to shine on their own.  Everything comes together beautifully
    on the slinky ""Tell Noah About the Rain"", a spooky slide through a decaying relationship smothered in vibes
    and subtly noisy guitar.  Migala fronthombre Abel Hernandez even offers up some vocals for closer ""Whiskey"",
    which is always welcome-- the guy's like a cross between Lou Rawls and Stuart Staples and his voice is just
    awesome here.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, amid all the excellent material are a few songs that just don't push as hard sonically, and
    these are generally the low points of the album.  ""Flavor of the Month"" and ""Happiness Avoids Me"" are just
    too singy-strummy to stand up to their neighbors.  And I guess maybe that's what I don't like about so much
    singer/songwriter stuff-- most of it's just not adventurous enough musically.  If your whole pitch to a
    listener lynchpins on a great melody and some killer lyrics, well, you have to deliver, or the song won't.
    Thankfully, Aroah largely manages to do just that, despite a couple near misses.</p></div>"|294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/294-no-podemos-ser-amigos/|7.0|Joe Tangari

Except that it says it all about itself, and is very
    crafty about saying it well. The Caribbean has always made serious pop without a purpose, built of sequences
    of unmatched chords, cobbled from lyrical scraps that mean nothing in and of themselves, but when combined
    mean less. Doing this in a compelling way is no small accomplishment, and it comes off as thrillingly
    coercive: you're forced to occupy their barren pop architecture, unfinished, unfurnished and uninhabited.
    You don't understand it, but, though you might not admit it, you do hope it will understand you. Or at
    least not destroy you.</p><p>
    
    The songs are built with three tools: distance, omission, and interruption. Distance comes in when what you
    hear is very far from what any one person could have meant to put together. If you think of the original
    song as a canvas, there's been a fair amount of collaborative shredding, staining, stacking, and abrasion
    before this thing made it to the gallery wall. Omission comes in with the oblique lyrical style and
    near-incomplete textures. You feel like there's a real live pop song in there somewhere, but it seems that
    most of the essential moments have been recorded over with silence or incidental noise. There's obviously
    still a skeleton to hang a song on, but you start to wonder whether you're the one who was supposed to
    bring it.</p><p>
    
    Interruption refers to the host of accidental and ambient noises that flick your attention away from the
    action just as you're starting to follow along. Dishes clinking, microphone sputum, crackling static,
    antique telephones, or synth grains lure your ear away from the loping meat of the song just as it's
    sending out spores to slip under your skin. And they get there, without any hint of the irony that
    usually makes academic pop like this unpalatable. These songs are for real, but they're not about
    disappointment, or complacency, or shame, or attention, or glee. They're about themselves.</p><p>
    
    Without ironic distance, such oblique experiments can seem exhausting. But only on the giving end: it
    takes a humble and prolific writer, some cunning musicians, a very patient engineer, and an overarching
    commitment to self-censorship to pull an album like this off. On the receiving end, however, the pop
    wreckages of ""History's First Know-It-All"" are quite easy to enter. Most are loaded with all-purpose
    catharsis, ready to be nodded to on the way to a blind date, or just as things are getting serious,
    or a few weeks after the break-up. They're taut with a kind of pointless frankness, but the point
    is just to be taut. And they are.</p></div>"|1308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1308-historys-first-know-it-all/|7.7|Jascha Hoffman

    deaf ears in the decades since its release; in fact, it seems as though war itself has become a form of
    entertainment, the way it's broken down to a few iconographic videogame images:  During the Persian
    Gulf War we saw buildings ringed by laser site positioners obliterated in seconds, but we never saw
    the bodies that were torn apart by those same explosions.  The war was remote and mechanical, an
    awesome show of force with little human toll, if you believed your television.</p><p>
    
    War even seems to be regarded by networks these days in the same way that any other form of
    entertainment is: like any other slice of reality TV programming, a war is a chance to reposition
    yourself in the ratings.  Given the state of television, film and popular culture today, I'd say
    ""Entertainment Is Over"" is nearly as hopeful a statement as its ancestor.  Of course, I don't know if
    this is what the band thinks, though I suspect some similar sentiment lies at the heart of their
    decision to name the album that; addressing societal malaise doesn't seem to be at the heart of what
    the Swords Project are all about.  Ultimately, these six Oregonians want you to smash your head on the
    post-rock and enter their world for about forty minutes, to turn the blinders on.  Their self-titled
    debut EP established them as a sort of gentler, subtler West Coast Mogwai, with a Godspeed-y concept
    of tension and release in some well-conceived arrangements.</p><p>
    
    While that EP sported some very understated vocals, it didn't suggest singing was a big priority for
    the band, and given their genre, it was pretty easy to assume it wasn't.  Strangely, though, they've
    opted to play this card more often on their first full-length, though it's virtually never the center
    of attention.  One wonders why the band sends bassist Corey Fickens up to the microphone at all; he
    has a good voice, but he's rarely intelligible or accomplishing anything that, musically speaking, a
    viola player couldn't add in his place.  The Swords seem desperately to want a human focal point for
    their sound, but it really isn't necessary. It's not really distracting, either, it's just an odd
    tactical move.</p><p>
    
    Apart from the vocals, we find the band soaring over much the same ground as before, though they've
    developed their texture a little more fully this time around.  There are no absolute standouts like
    the stunning bowshot ""Shannon's Wedding Song"" from their EP, but they're wandering less these days,
    building their songs with more precision.  The drums have an open, room mic sound, behaving texturally
    as much as rhythmically while Rhodes keys and electronics bubble around the edges.</p><p>
    
    The big statements are left mostly to Liza Reitz's violin, and guitarists Ryan Stowe and Jeffrey
    Gardner, who are deeply, completely in tune with each other.  Neither guitar ever moves too far into
    the other's space, and they frequently play off each other, with one laying down cosmic soundscapes
    while the other states a theme or cues the rest of the band to action.  Closer ""New Shapes"" sounds
    as though it's drowning, the guitars surfacing through the translucent production for gasps of air,
    while the drums flail like helpless limbs, kicking up the foam that eventually brings everything back
    to the surface.</p><p>
<i>Entertainment Is Over If You Want It</i> ends there, scarcely above water, struggling to breathe
    and regain its bearings.  As the electronics sputter to an end, it feels like an appropriate close,
    and satisfies the notion somewhere inside me that globally, things are spinning out of control, and
    in the process, downward.  Entertainment isn't over-- neither is war-- but you can join in the
    hopeful refrain that beckons the end.</p></div>"|7676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7676-entertainment-is-over-if-you-want-it/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Nothing against
    the man personally-- I'm sure he's a noble Canadian and all-- but nobody else in his profession inspires
    stronger feelings of rage in my bosom.  His last album, <i>This Night</i>, was a throwback slice of 70s
    singer/songwriter excess: self-indulgent, bloated, nonsensical.  Maybe if Bejar restricted himself to his
    other band, Destroyer, I could peacefully ignore him, yet he insists upon sullying the good name of The New
    Pornographers with his phoned-in, momentum-desiccating contributions.  Grrrrr.</p><p>
    
    And I don't drop this piece of character assassination to serve as mere see-saw balance to the frequent
    Bejar gushing put forth by Matt-ador LeMay in this webspace; this is full-disclosure pre-opinion, because
    if I were to describe Mull Historical Society (formerly a duo, now just auteur Colin MacIntyre) as the
    Scottish Destroyer, it would be just about the cruelest entry in my slambook.  But for you, loyal Pitchfork
    reader, such a comparison could possibly be a glowing recommendation.  Diff'rent strokes, y'see.</p><p>
    
    Similarities: a voice firmly rooted in his throat (though slightly less squawky than Bejar's, not to mention
    more appealing), a love for the lush-pop era of Jackson Browne and peers, and a preference for working alone.
    Differences: MacIntyre possesses an alternate voice for versatility beyond talk-singing every tune, offers
    less forced-juxtaposition poetry, and is somewhat more genteel in instrumentation-- due to that whole British
    thing.</p><p>
    
    The most profound resemblance between the two ""groups"" is the frustrating (if occasional) glimpse of melodic
    skill buried amidst the cliches and mediocrity, pleading for an editor or equal collaborator to swoop in and
    excavate.  Opener ""The Final Arrears"" wields a sharp hook of a chorus, but the syrupy, wistful post-Britpop
    verses blunt the impact.  ""Minister for Genetics and Insurance M.P."" shows glimpses of wry, Steely Dan-saluting
    jazz-rock, and ""The Supermarket Strikes Back"" is infectious and pleasant, but with over-glossed production
    and humdrum structure, it veers a little too close to a particular amphibious Wet Sprocket for comfort.</p><p>
    
    While I'm taking cheap shots, I should add that it just... pisses in my tea how critics (including the grand
    old <i>NY Times</i>) can take the non sequiturs Bejar shovels for serious poetry (what the hell is ""I flew
    into a lesbian rage"" supposed to mean?)  And yet, for all his faults, Destroyer-man has never penned anything
    as trite as ""Asylum"", which pleads ""place it on the sunny side of me"" like it can't wait to soundtrack a
    montage of a couple tearfully packing up their respective things before tearfully booking their respective
    breakup flights on Expedia.com.  MacIntyre isn't afraid of getting his hands a little sappy, whether
    slow-dancing (""Don't Take Your Love Away from Me"") or biting Yorke's ""High and Dry"" falsetto to emote ""can
    anyone feel anything inside of me?"" on ""Can"".</p><p>
    
    Actually, in light of that simpering, Destroyer-lovers might want to scratch the above backhanded
    recommendation.  Though Mull Historical Society is an act one could easily file under ""pleasant-enough pop,""
    at 13 tracks (plus a bonus disc!), MacIntyre's strictly 80bpm velvet-lined melancholia will test the patience
    of any Anglophile.  My dislike of Daniel Bejar might be some volatile mixture of irrationality, priggishness,
    and psychosis, but one thing it's not is unfair, and McIntyre is not quite up to the level of ruining New
    Pornographers albums.</p></div>"|5498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5498-us/|5.1|Rob Mitchum

    They'd bring out the bird every night around twelve, and we'd all get a chance to dance with it.  Good
    times.""</p><p>
    
    I'd agreed to help my parents clean house in an effort to amend the fact that I was living with them for
    the next few months while I got back on my feet.  Like any gross turnover of an entire house full of memories
    there were always a few surprises to be discovered.</p><p>
    
    ""I didn't know you went to discos, "" I said, my tongue laced with derision.  ""Weren't they sort of... lame?""</p><p>
    
    ""What?!"" Shock was apparent in her tone, as she queried, ""Aren't you the big 'music-guy'?  I'm sure it was
    more of a party than the droning 'live-experiences' you always describe.  Besides, I don't think you'd care
    to admit how many of those 'lame' disco-beats are found littered throughout the music that you're constantly
    waking your father and I up with every night.  Son, you need to get in touch with your roots.""</p><p>
    
    While I can't whole-heartedly support the majority of her comments, the latter-- regarding my need to
    understand the history of some of the music I unabashedly endorse-- is true enough.  Luckily, Soul Jazz
    Records has done some of the legwork for me, collecting obscure classics from the masterful proto-disco
    Flahrda-based label TK Records onto a single disc entitled <i>Miami Sound</i>.</p><p>
    
    Prior to their stint as KC &amp; The Sunshine Band, Rick Finch and Harry ""KC"" Casey were merely two songwriters
    among an entire staff of talented arrangers, producers, and musicians turning out hits for Henry Stone's
    TK label.  While the compilation includes many tracks from such successful artists as George and Gwen McCrae
    (both of whom would go on to crossover from funk/soul into disco, George doing so with the touted first track
    of disco, ""Rock Your Baby""), Timmy Thomas, and Betty Wright, there's also due respect to lesser known artists
    such as golden-voiced Helene Smith (""You Got to Be a Man""), R&amp;B-crooner; Joey Gilmore (""Somebody Done Took My
    Baby""), mid-period funk-ers All the People (""Cramp Your Style""), and lilting nymphet Della Humphrey (""Don't
    Make the Good Girls Go Bad"").</p><p>
    
    Among the most prized gems recovered by the collection, though, are undoubtedly the multiple tracks featuring
    James Knight &amp; The Butlers.  One of the most obscure artists from the TK stable, Knight is also one of the
    self-described ""funkiest cats ever to come out of Miami, Florida.""  ""Save Me"" sports one of the biggest hooks
    on the album with a chorus worthy of becoming an anthem, as Knight, surrounded by an entire room full of
    percussive warmth and undulating basslines, ushers in his plaintive and repetitive cries of ""SAVE ME!"" before
    bringing the song to a conclusion with the distant sound of clapping hands.</p><p>
    
    Changing this festive mood
    quite a bit is the still spectacular ""Fantasy World"".  Beginning with a simple muted string rhythm, the
    track is fleshed out further by a heavy organ and some mellow horns before it takes a turn for the weird
    with a reverb-laden chorus and a distorted organ that's light years ahead of similar effects in fusion,
    funk, and even the Prince-indebted new wave of the early 1980s.</p><p>
    
    Other compositions sound equally fresh and unnerving, as is the case with Timmy Thomas' ""Funky Me"", a
    keyboard composition that utilizes an ancient drum program to breathe fresh life into the already aging
    genre, adumbrating the future of post-punk and industrial music as well.  What makes it sound even more
    disturbing is the realization that the song was originally the B-side to the unbelievably commercial and
    popular track ""Why Can't We Live Together"", making it one of the oddest and most rewarding choices for
    inclusion on the compilation.</p><p>
    
    The only drawback to <i>Miami Sound</i> is that, due to the source material used for the majority of these
    tracks (more than likely a series of 45s), the bulk of them never have time to develop completely, tapering
    off just as a good groove is established.  This is more than forgiven, though, as gratefulness for the
    compilation's existence outweighs the disappointment of not quite getting enough of a good thing.  Besides,
    as the liner notes point out, this is only volume one in a series that threatens to exhaustively explore
    the connections between the final lingering golden days of soul music and the upstart genesis of dance and
    disco, thus bridging an unfairly maligned generational and musical gap.  In regard to the recent resurgence
    of tinny guitars and funky breakbeats in dancepunk and indie rock, this compilation should be considered
    indispensable in gaining an understanding and appreciation for the roots of what will hopefully rise from
    obscurity as a viable element of the musical canon: that funky, funky Miami groove.</p></div>"|1990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1990-miami-sound-rare-funk-and-soul-from-miami-florida-1967-1974/|9.0|Andrew Bryant

    figure-- those wacky kids in Tokyo Sex Destruction have the goddamn same
    last name! Hold up, keep a lid on: before you go running home announcing
    that you just stumbled upon Spain's garage-rock Jackson 5, note first that
    there are only four guys and, second, the brothers Sinclair are kicking it
    MC5 political, not a bit biological.</p><p>
    In punk, a shared surname might represent unity, a gimmick, a constructed
    band history. With the Ramones and the Danielson Famile, there's a bit of
    each. In this case, though, the move's obviously a nod to the band's hero,
    John Sinclair, the white panther philosopher and agent provocateur behind
    the Detroit faves mentioned above. So why adopt the surname of the guy who
    didn't even pick up a guitar? Only getting half the MC5's genius, J.C.
    (drums, voice, Hammond, claps), R.R. (lead guitar, voice, and claps),
    R.J. (second guitar and spiritual advisor), and S.F. (fuzz bass, voice
    and claps), are content to shout ""hey!"" and play dress-up in that Make-Up-meets-The-Hives,
    black-pants-with-white-belt style. I just wonder why the spiritual advisor
    doesn't get to clap.</p><p>
    Sometimes appearance is everything. Here, the product's coated in revolutionaries,
    public protest, Black Panther rallies. Tokyo Sex Destruction also offers a
    conceptual framework in which Le Red Soul Communitte (spelled differently on
    the cover, side, actual CD, and when it appears as the name of a song) is
    treated not only as the title of the album, but also an actual,
    difficult-to-spell organization. Commies are very sinister, right?
    Especially ones with soul! Continuing the fashion statement, the liner
    notes include ""Revolutionary Violence"", a Hallmark version of Noam Chomsky.
    They subtitle the album a ""10 Points Plan"" and though I listened closely for
    the fucking plan, all I could figure out is that they love soul music. To
    be honest, I'm still unsure how that forms any kind of legitimate escape route.</p><p>
    TSD aren't all slick styling, though. ""Break Out"", the opener, is a great
    song. Clapping through its tight syncopation I found myself pretty excitedly
    thinking that not since those sassy N.O.U. guys offered kids-in-the-know a
    thirteen-point plan to destroy America have revolutionaries armed with
    swaggering guitar chops, Hammond organ, tambourines, a vague political
    argot, and fine sartorial choices kicked it so righteously.</p><p>
    Ah, but bliss is an
    evanescent son of a bitch: at just about the three-quarter mark of the first
    blast, the band rears into full pontification mode. When the guitars fall
    back but the handclaps and rhythm section keep up, rest assured that the
    vocalist's about to start talking shit. For his first sermon, R.J. tells us
    that a large percentage of people are unable to afford their rent, but rich
    people spend a lot of money on junk. In rock music, as in emotional oratory,
    the force of the delivery causes more of an effect than the bare material,
    so maybe I shouldn't judge the band on its empty political posturing. To
    cite the cliché, it's not what you say it's how you say it. So, ideally,
    the energy, the sweat and adrenaline are the message? You dig? Me neither.</p><p>
    Not until the eponymous final track does this band make good on the promise
    of the album's opening track: ""Le Red Soul Communitte"" has the ferocious
    energy of ""Break Out"" but adds a layer of distorted percussion and super-fuzz
    bass. It's more non-verbal than the eight middling tracks before it and
    relies nicely on an interchange between the pealing feedback of dueling
    guitars, organ, and barely there handclaps. Nice stuff.</p><p>
    When modeling sound on an obvious archetype, strong writing with solid hooks
    become essential. I mean, why not toss in a catchy chorus or other brief
    moments of distinction? When Tokyo Sex Destruction get around to clapping
    outside the box and tap into some genuine rock verve, they transcend simply
    parroting their past masters and wind up sounding okay. But those moments
    are rare: at this point the Sinclair family proves to be but another band
    sloppily evoking a nostalgic rock history, sans-urgency. It's a politics
    of misheard intangibles, a lightweight taking on something that once weighed
    much more.</p></div>"|8097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8097-le-red-soul-communitte-10-points-program/|5.8|Brandon Stosuy

    Check the bassist as a perennial Jan Brady: habitually overlooked, occasionally neglected, and usually
    crouched humbly behind a black Marshall stack, looking bored and/or distracted while Howling Singer and
    Shredding Guitarist blindly lick up every last glory-filled puddle of sweaty, lustful adoration with their
    long, pierced pink tongues.</p><p>
    
    2003 hasn't been such a stellar year for the four-string. The White Stripes made a big, noisy fuss (again)
    about (still) being a strictly picks-and-sticks outfit; Midwestern brethren The Black Keys have done pretty
    much the same.  John Entwistle was replaced about nine minutes after he died.  Les Claypool is jamming with
    members of Phish.  And the once uber-cool drums-and-bass phenomenon of yesteryear has somehow tunneled
    itself into near irrelevance, with hipsters everywhere frantically adjusting their caps and muttering,
    ""That shit was soooo 2002.""</p><p>
    
    New York's Ui, however, boasts two bassists, a newly initiated multi-instrumentalist, and a drummer.  A
    four-man rhythm-section revenge fantasy, Ui's latest LP, <i>Answers</i>, isn't nearly as wearied or as
    Spinal Tap as its lineup might suggest-- this is intellectual, muscular stuff, metrical and expectedly
    throbbing.  Marked by dynamic shifts and experimental space-hops-- and teeming with loads of (vaguely)
    jazzy grooves and cerebral pet tricks-- Ui persistently shake off the obvious, fiddling with time signatures,
    splicing, diversifying, and following an invisible sonic line that bounces and twists, stops, and starts
    before doubling back again.</p><p>
<i>Answers</i> is Ui's third full-length since forming as an instrumental outfit in the early 90s, and
    conveniently, their third official line-up (founding members Sasha Frere-Jones and Clem Waldmann have
    withstood both shift changes).  Yes: Sasha Frere-Jones plays bass for Ui, which, to the non-rock crit crowd,
    might not mean a whole lot-- but to those of us perpetually buried in our awesomely Eddyfied <i>Voice</i>
    music pages, Frere-Jones was already a pretty fucking rad New York stylist, responsible for consistently
    penning some of the city's best music writing, and his nimble work on <i>Answers</i> only adds new dimension
    to the (er, at least my) forever growing vat of SF-J love.  If nothing else, this album proves Frere-Jones
    knows his shit.</p><p>
    
    Heavily ESG-influenced, Ui boast tons of strong New York rhythm-roots, drawing from a long, twisted lineage
    of Gotham-based dance-funksters-- even legendary Liquid Liquid bassist (man, these guys are secular!) Richard
    McGuire is signed on as a graphic designer (he also devised CD packaging for <i>Lifelike</i> and the
    <i>Fires</i> EP), lending <i>Answers</i> its curved, puzzle-piece face.  And to further pad their collective
    artistic-collaborator resumes (as well as, I suppose, prove themselves less provincial) Ui toured and joined
    studio forces with Stereolab in 1998 (see <i>Fires</i>, recorded under the name Uilab, which features two
    originals and four-- yeah, four-- covers of Eno's ""St. Elmo's Fire"").</p><p>
<i>Answers</i>, though, is all Ui.  ""Back Up"" pops open the album with the kind of burst that should make
    its title proud: alternately rumbling and reeling, the song is a bouncy tornado of funked-out grooves and
    sweet little melodies, each rubbing up against the others and gleefully motoring along.  ""Get Hot, You Bum!""
    is packed with thick, fuzzy basslines; ""Mrs. Lady Lady"" fronts (presumably vintage) synths and some (easily
    danceable) rhythmic breakdowns.</p><p>
    
    A truckload of instruments-- myriad bizarre, creaky synths, even a guitar or two-- overload the album, but
    for Ui, it invariably skews back to the thump-thump-thump.  The band's tendency to operate almost exclusively
    in beat-driven mode is interesting, and, for the most part, enormously successful-- but the inevitable
    fallout of is that it can get a wee repetitive after a while.  Astoundingly, not repetitive enough to
    warrant serious complaint, but once you figure these songs out, there's not too much more to head back to--
    unless, of course, you just wanna dance.</p><p>
    
    When the world finally stops presuming that guitars (and, incidentally, cymbal crashes) are at the melodic
    core of a rock band, it should become impossible not to also recognize the bass as a surprisingly lucid
    sonic pioneer.  Sparse without feeling empty, clear without being awkwardly straightforward, Ui can remind
    even the most jaded of guitar gods that what Mingus (or Mike Watt or Peter Hook) did wasn't a fluke-- the
    bass doesn't have to be supplementary.  It's only a matter of time until dudes start tugging acoustic
    four-strings into coffeehouses to pluck sweet lines and collect wads of cell numbers from impressed ladies.
    Rhythm is the new lead.</p></div>"|8335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8335-answers/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

    in Chicago avant-icon Hal Russell's NRG Ensemble in the late 80s.  Along
    with Mars Williams, Vandermark provided an edgy, almost punky spirit to the
    band's music, and, after Russell's death, went on to form his own celebrated
    outfit with Williams, The Vandermark Five.  Trombonist Jeb Bishop and the
    outstanding bassist Kent Kessler have appeared on all the group's records
    since 1997's <i>Single Piece Flow</i>, but Dave Rempis eventually replaced
    Williams.  The quintet's music, like Hal Russell's, has generally maintained
    a space not easily pigeonholed as straight jazz, nor is it strictly avant-garde,
    free or jazz-rock; Vandermark might draw the easiest comparisons to New York
    fellow head-of-the-classer John Zorn, or more accurately, Ellery Eskelin.</p><p>
<i>Airports for Light</i> is the Vandermark Five's sixth record, and will be of
    interest to anyone who has enjoyed their previous five.  In fact, the
    familiarity can be distracting: the playing is spot-on, all the time,
    especially from Bishop and Vandermark, both of whom display a fairly
    intimidating mastery of styles and timbres.  The music ranges from
    European-styled free improvisation, rock and funk moves, sudden bursts of
    activity and all the cohesion you'd expect from a band of players who'd
    been together for much of the past decade.  But if things occasionally
    seem a little <i>too</i> familiar, it's not for lack of interesting ideas.</p><p>
    
    And it's not that this stuff doesn't swing-- it certainly does.  ""Both Sides"",
    dedicated to legendary jazz tenor saxophonist Budd Johnson, lays it all out
    pretty clearly.  Johnson's tenure with the pianist Earl ""Fatha"" Hines earned
    him a rep as one of the swingingest cats in town, and fittingly, Vandermark's
    tune is half Chicago strut and half snappy Playboy lounge blue.  His solo
    actually reminds me of another sax-man, Plas Johnson, most famous for his
    playing on Henry Mancini's infamous <i>Pink Panther</i> theme, and a damn
    fine swingman in his own right.  Vandermark's playing is loose, but clean;
    understated but obviously nuanced.  He plays a perfect chorus, and Bishop's
    more modern sounding strains seem somehow misplaced in comparison (though
    not much, especially in light of the free jazz on either side of this
    song).  The worst I can say is that the music is a tad on the comfy side--
    and that's only a problem if you want it to be.</p><p>
    
    ""Other Cuts"", dedicated to Curtis Mayfield, takes the nice-n-easy road, too,
    but as it applies to low-down 70s funk rather than beatnik jazz.  And just
    as the band made quick work of swing, they have little problem finding the
    pocket here.  Again, Vandermark's solo is precise to a fault-- not in his
    choice of notes or articulation, but in the way it so easily falls in line
    with the scores of small group funk sides of the late 60s and 70s.  Think Lou
    Donaldson at his meanest, or The Crusaders playing a gig in a Houston dive
    on a weeknight.  Of course, Kessler's completely free, unaccompanied solo
    midway through sort of blows any ""authenticity"" out the window, but only
    for the better.  <i>Airports for Light</i> is at its best when it surprises.</p><p>
    
    Several explicitly exploratory cuts-- like ""Plus (for Fredrik Ljungkvist)"",
    reminiscent of the early Art Ensemble of Chicago records, and ""Initials (for
    Jean Tinguely)"", a fairly chaotic mixture of bleating outbursts and clangs--
    demonstrate that Vandermark's group is at home without the net of a genre
    frame (though my favorite moments are actually when their wheels start to
    come off, as on the blistering opener, ""Cruz Campo"", dedicated to artist
    Gerhard Richter, who was immortalized in the indie world when Sonic Youth
    took his <i>Two Candles</i> as the cover of <i>Daydream Nation</i>).  Here,
    the kinetic, unhinged energy splatters all over the place, with Bishop in
    particular navigating the catastrophe with fresh, scatterbrained ideas.  The
    band revisits this vibe on the closer, ""Confluence (for Sonny Rollins)"",
    though the end result is less a joyous anarchy than it is your workaday
    explosion of 60s-comeback era Rollins meeting post-John Zorn mash.
    (As a side note, Vandermark is a major Rollins fan, and some editions of
    this CD come with a bonus disc of six more of his songs.)</p><p>
    
    The good news for folks not normally on the jazz bus is that Vandermark's
    records-- with this band and without-- tend to offer outsiders a helping
    hand.  His own playing can be fierce, or noisy, and his band is always
    top-notch, but the tunes are hardly off-putting.  In fact, in a way, The
    Vandermark Five are a perfect bridge for rock fans raised on the notion that
    jazz is the music of a secret society filled with a thousand guys named Bud
    or Johnny.  By the same token, longtime listeners may not be knocked out of
    their seat, but should at least find enough of interest to invest the time
    it takes to make it through.  Not quite as viscerally engaging as catching
    their set at the club, but good stuff nonetheless.</p></div>"|8397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8397-airports-for-light/|7.2|Dominique Leone

    the right to vote in this land of liberati. Cat Power's <i>You Are Free</i> could lullabotomize a speed freak,
    Lisa Germano's new ferris wheel warns that you must be over thirty to ride, and Karen O's Yeah Yeah Yeahs
    crosswired all anticipation by releasing the year's best singles collection masquerading as an album. The
    finer offerings from the speculum-prone have been the results of collaborative efforts (Ms. John Soda, The
    Majesticons, The New Pornographers, Adult., Fruit Bats), which sent me digging through last year's
    while-we-were-out promo stack in search of a grrl who could strr my leftover soul. And even the crème of
    that plastic slurry is a disc on which a female salvages the work of a sub-pop patriarch.</p><p>
    Shrimper and Inland empiricist Franklin Bruno is best unknown for his solo heapings, or for his work as one
    half of The Extra Glenns with The Mountain Goats' John Darnielle, or as the frontman for the ill-recorded
    Nothing Painted Blue. He's a clever sod, often to a fault, as his songs build to rhymes/puns of which the
    listener detects he is all too proud.  So he occasionally comes across as a neurotic talent, like that guy
    who has to do a bicycle trick on every corner. Bruno's covers, though, are reverent; consult his sweet take
    on ""What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?"" Jenny Toomey ran the Simple Machines label and (among other bands)
    led the agitprop outfit Tsunami, a group that indie traffickers felt bound to like, despite its
    nigh-monochromatic slogan-lyrics. Toomey's recent activist role is as the executive director of the Future
    of Music Coalition, which wages a noble losing battle against the megamedia casseroles who will insure that
    your children burn the Dixie Chicks' children at the stake, with help from, say, Coke, which will by then
    be called Water and will be pumped into Americans at birth to ensure that they're on schedule for their
    Puberty/Insulin implants at thirteen.</p><p>
<i>Tempting</i> seamlessly melds the strengths of Toomey and Bruno while tempering their indulgences. Toomey's
    voice is a brash and sensitive weapon with a deep trill that can suggest a cabaret where the armpit hair is
    off the hook (okay, a drag Scott Walker), but it also retains a humble twang (and on-key warble) reminiscent
    of elastic crooners such as Iris Dement or Jimmie Dale Gilmore. Bruno's songcrafting chops deserve the
    flesh-out they receive not only from Toomey's careful inflections, but from the arrangements of the eleven
    terrific musicians involved. You won't make it through opener ""Your Inarticulate Boyfriend"" without noting
    some scariachi that is particularly Calexican: yup, Joey Burns and John Convertino are in the house. Bruno
    himself contributes elegant guitar and piano so convincingly that one wonders why he ever dicked around with
    power-pop, while Amy Domingues multitasks on castanets, organ, cello, and bass.</p><p>
    About that opener: it is so damn funny, about an intellectually hierarchical bond in which one partner ""holds
    up both ends of the conversation."" The majority of the songs present relationshippery as a surrender brimming
    with risk and ""martyrdom"" and compromise, but couply togetherness remains an irresistible proposition.
    ""Cheat"", for example, is a gorgeous plea for a rendezvous reeking of ethical abandon. ""Only a Monster""
    concludes: ""I wouldn't be frightened if you were a monster/ But you're only human and that's even worse.""
    ""Pointless Triangle"" uses a Ouija board to negotiate a tryst, with a great line about the almost psychotic
    exclusivity that emerges in intense courtship: the speaker confesses that ""the small of your back"" is where
    ""the weight of the world"" lies.</p><p>
    Politiquing surfaces on ""Masonic Eye"", which asks its object of desire, ""Will it take a war between the
    classes/ To get you to digest what you consume?"" And ""Unionbusting"" presents a long affair as parallel to
    failed labor negotiations. The western swing vibe expands endearingly to bossa nova at points on the record,
    with only the resolute defeatist anthem ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" threatening to Sheryl Crowify itself and
    ""Let's Stay In"" sounding so showtuney that the listener hurls sugar substitute. The rest of <i>Tempting</i>
    showcases the good kind of vomit-inducing beauty. Hell, ""Empty Sentiment"" could open an existential sitcom,
    maybe with Kirk Cameron as Dad this time.</p><p>
    Toomey's choice of tributizing Bruno's sap-alog is ten times more effective than releasing an album about
    Clear Channel or RIAA rape. In this era of automatonic uncuriosity and assent, being humane and compassionate
    is almost radical. <i>Tempting</i> makes me want to do something as definitively ho-hum as have kids, even
    if they're going to be wiped out by a cancer wave or fried by a homeless genius with nuclear roller skates.
    I hope she loves that, even as an activist in a time of abominable transgressions, she made a ""love"" album,
    because (sniff) love is real. The guilt in these songs is, too. You know this if you ever saw a documentary
    about Palestinian rubble, but stayed transfixed by your date's fantastic hands.</p></div>"|8106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8106-tempting-jenny-toomey-sings-the-songs-of-franklin-bruno/|8.2|William Bowers

Happy little organ chords start perking
    around, then squishy synth stabs; the flute starts to flutter while some drums build in.  Then the beat runs
    off, a suave and steady groove that'll play host to a funk guitar riff in a minute or two: it's like
    Fischer-Price techno, sunny and reassuringly blocky at the same time. When the beat bulks up, it's not the
    usual housey hi-hat loop coasting over. It's a guy. With his mouth. Going ""shick-a-thoomp, shick-a-thoomp.""</p><p>
    
    To liberally paraphrase Alanis Morrisette: Thank you, Germany. Over the past couple years, the Germans have
    been churning out breeds of leftfield electronica that are pretty much revelatory, handily stirring up a lot
    of the genre divisions that IDM (""intelligent"" dance music) and regular old house, techno, and electro
    (""dumb-by-implication"" dance music?) have set up for themselves. Artists on labels like Klang Electronik
    and Bpitch Control have taken up the microprocessed sound-sculpting and hyperdetailed laptop jones from IDM,
    sure, but not so much the penchant for ""cinematic soundscapes,"" the heady splatter, or the fear of all things
    danceable. Instead, they've made techno and minimal techno, house and microhouse, IDM and electro, and music
    that's more than happy-- almost giddily happy-- to be all of the above. They seem, basically, to be in love
    with all the sorts of music only machines can make, whether that means abstracted glitches or thumpy bass
    beats, ambient echoes or straight-up synth buzz.</p><p>
    
    This year has seen a few too many standouts in German sound-design to safely single out <i>It's Not for You
    as It Is for Us</i> as any clear winner-- even in Bergheim 34's more subdued neck of these woods, Barbara
    Morgenstern's <i>Nichts Muss</i> and Ellen Allien's <i>Berlinette</i> offer strong enough competition that
    doling out handicaps seems a bit pointless. What brings Bergheim to you here, today, is that ""shick-a-thoomp"":
    the slightest bit more than even their immediate colleagues, Bergheim have this free-floating and weirdly
    optimistic openness to the possibilities of their sound that makes them rather unique. That, and the fact
    that this record contains one of the better singles of the year so far, a subliminally humming groover called
    ""Random Access Memory"" that seems to crystallize everything that was exciting about Stereolab, Broadcast,
    and Lali Puna in one pillowy electric pulse-- a track that should be sitting on as many indie playlists as
    electro and techno ones.</p><p>
    
    So yes, Bergheim do pop songs, on which Anne Vortisch sighs and croons all subdued and matter-of-fact over
    click-and-whir drum programs and tickly basslines. On ""System"", she actually puts a hint of R&amp;B; into it--
    between and that and the pizzicato string plucks, the track winds up sounding almost like an Aaliyah single
    as reformatted by an IDM auteur. But Bergheim's feet were originally planted in techno, and they do it here,
    if on the smallest scale imaginable: there's a minimal, microscopic feel to their tiny-music crackle and pop.
    On ""Nasty Girl"", a stiff, clattering beat-- <i>just</i> the beat-- stutters and winds around itself as
    complexly as laptop tweakery ever can. It's all nearly subliminal: ""Frogs on Grills"", for instance, seems
    oddly unassuming as its gentle click-and-cut programming revs a coasting beat, reedy wood-block tones, and
    some squishy funk touches through a casual series of twists, turns, builds, and falls. It feels like IDM,
    which is to say that you could fall asleep to it. But it also feels like if you turned it up loud enough,
    it could almost turn into a dancefloor stepper.</p><p>
    
    And they play around. <i>It's Not for You</i> was supposedly created via online file-swapping-- the four
    members trading bits and pieces and finishing one another's ideas-- and it shows, not only in the grab-bag
    jumble of concepts here, but in their tone, as well. Half the time, it seems as if the four of them were all
    trying their hardest to surprise one another as often as possible. When Vortisch starts singing on ""Nasty
    Girl"", she sings the melody from Michael Jackson's ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"" over a series of
    stop-on-a-dime breakdowns. (It's not the only moment of recognition, either: the prechorus to ""Random Access
    Memory"" features her Nico-ish delivery of Melle Mel's infamous ""Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge""
    chorus from ""The Message"").  ""US Key"" makes slice-and-dice with the mouth noises again, ornamenting them
    with a careful bass walk and programmed stabs of Vortisch's voice; ""Sucker Pt. 1""  cuts up organ tones and
    drum shuffles until it sounds like someone put jazz fusion in a blender and minced it into a fine goo.</p><p>
    
    But that's standard German sound-sculpting, and what's likeable about this record is the possibility for
    surprise. Like on ""Coding Stains"", a grooved-out remix of ""Cotton Stains"" by Andy Weatherall's fantastic
    electro-tech Two Lone Swordsmen project: this is Bergheim's Night Out, with the beat rocking steady and
    even the vocal cut-up leaving plenty of room for a housey, repeating sample. And there's the second of two
    bonus tracks, possibly the most fascinating things here-- a big ominous chant from Vortisch that starts off
    brooding and works its way over to some psyched-up synthesizer freak-outs. As one Pitchforker says of this
    record: ""It's pretty weird."" And it is, though not in the usual way: it's weird in its surprises and
    beat-warping Easter Eggs; weird in its impossibility to pin down effectively; weird in its carefree way of
    floating from idea to idea and trusting you to follow happily along. ""Weird"" meaning ""interesting"" meaning,
    well, ""good.""</p></div>"|661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/661-its-not-for-you-as-it-is-for-us/|8.1|Nitsuh Abebe

    one.  ""Eh, I heard the food's not that good,"" the other replies. ""Yeah,"" responds the first, ""but the DJ is
    really great!""</p><p>
    
    As DJ and vinyl culture has infiltrated nearly as many facets of social interaction as Clear Channel, so has
    it also traveled into the past through the feverish groove consumption to bring forth crates of obscure beats
    lost to time. And because of such investigation through the dust of record bins, figures that would have been
    written off to the times-- folks like Les McCann, Ananda Shankar, Idris Muhammad, or even Liquid Liquid--
    have gained a renaissance back to sunlit brunch patios.</p><p>
    
    One of the more curious unearthings was of Chicago singer/songwriter Terry Callier. Arising out of the
    coffeehouse scene in the early 60s, sporting a cloth hat, beard, and acoustic guitar, he found his way into
    the studios at Chess and Cadet, cutting three infinite-Saturday-afternoon-in-bed albums with producer Charles
    Stepney, himself famous for the pink laser light that was Minnie Riperton.  Before getting lost a the mix of
    label mergers and lay-offs in the late 70s, Callier shot up a few warning flares through the oncoming haze
    of disco and R&amp;B;, as his career began to go awry.</p><p>
<i>Fire on Ice</i>, from 1978, sputters on so many levels that it's hard to isolate just where things misfire. Is it the heavy-hand of producer Richard Evans, slathering saccharine strings
    over the funkier charts of jazz players like Eddie Harris and Phil Upchurch? Or is it the extraneous girl
    choruses fogging over Callier's own smoky, syrup-smooth voice? While it still conveys that gusty Chicago
    soul, cooing smoothly yet capable of dropping into a guttural growl, it barely salves the pat symbolism and
    synthesized schmaltz of ""Butterfly"" and ""African Violet"".</p><p>
    
    But even his talents can't escape the foreboding gravity of club kickdrums that had penetrated every genre
    by that time. With a weighty title neither the Bee-Gees nor Walter Gibbons could possibly have upheld,
    ""Disco in the Sky"" cringes as it crashes, Icarus-like, unable to commit fully to disco or focus on the
    strummed acoustic guitar, forcing Callier, for some reason, to call out to Hendrix and Lorelei in the
    middle of the song. More than anything else, it's the songwriting of Terry Callier and partner Larry Wade
    that mars the whole affair, the lyrics too flimsy to do his voice justice, much less bear the bloated
    arrangements.</p><p>
    
    Judging from the cover of <i>Turn You to Love</i>, Elektra's marketing focus was ratcheted up a notch the
    following year, recasting Terry Callier as ladies' man, with two tight bitties on the cover, and the man
    sizing up booties on the back, ready to mack.  There's even social commentary and talk of how much his
    mother loves him. Sliding across the nasty electro bass, Callier's two-textured throat trembles with warmth
    on ""Sign of the Times"" and cools with the Egyptian cotton button-down of ""Pyramids of Love"".  That leads into
    the satiny rustle of the title track, proving that he could've been a distinct R&amp;B; personality had the breaks
    gone his way, albeit one more like Leon Ware than Jeffrey Osborne.</p><p>
    
    The difference here is not in the studio gloss (though it is glaringly polished), but in the songs that Callier's
    sharp threads hang from. His cover of Steely Dan's ""Do It Again"", while missing the drugged groove and
    electric sitar solo, has portions of the Bard-ian verses to brighten with assloads of brass (including Fred
    Wesley) and a set of pipes that neither Becker nor Fagan could've ever exhaled.  And in addition to a Smokey
    Robinson cover, Callier redresses two old classics, ""Ordinary Joe"" and ""Occasional Rain"". The former, already
    perfect as pop, gets too heavy a makeover, but the latter retains the gentle grace of the original, the
    gradual touch of other instruments never overwhelming Callier's singular voice and guitar playing.</p><p>
    
    It's not the best way to turn you on to the excellent soul of Callier's past heights, when his best records
    could nearly be mentioned in the same sentence as the early works of Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, but
    there are traces of his voice that still linger on here. It can be worth a taste, but it does put an
    overwhelming slick of soft R&amp;B; on your tongue all the way down.</p></div>"|1254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1254-fire-on-ice-and-turn-you-to-love/|5.5|Andy Beta

    bitch.  It makes you accountable for all your bullshit, brings out your worst personality traits, and
    sometimes, makes you act like a crazy person.  Musical intimacy, on the other hand, isn't quite so
    complicated.  Most ""intimate"" music is strictly a one-way communication, and is rarely even remotely
    confrontational.  Xiu Xiu mastermind Jamie Stewart, on the other hand, has a way of turning such conventions
    against themselves, and on <i>Fag Patrol</i> he turns all the signifiers of intimate music into complex,
    often unnerving emotional weapons.</p><p>
<i>Fag Patrol</i> is a nine-song mini-album featuring largely acoustic reworkings of six songs from Xiu Xiu's
    previous three releases, along with two new tracks and a cover.  It isn't <i>Xiu Xiu Unplugged</i>, nor is
    it a Jamie Stewart solo record-- as with all Xiu Xiu releases up to this point, what it is can't be clearly
    defined.  But in keeping with the band's conformance to unconformity, <i>Fag Patrol</i> finds emotional
    power in unexpected places, pushing the concept of musical intimacy to uncomfortable levels while laying
    bare the strong songwriting at the core of Xiu Xiu's unique and profound musical statements.</p><p>
    
    But, strong though it may be, <i>Fag Patrol</i> is neither as unique nor as profound as either of Xiu Xiu's
    proper full-lengths, especially this year's monumental <i>A Promise</i>.   That album's standout track,
    ""Apistat Commander"", perfectly embodies everything that makes Xiu Xiu so compelling.  The moment when,
    pitted against a throbbing, impenetrable wall of industrial noise and organic hiss, Stewart's unstable
    tenor wails, ""Oh, this relief it's the oddest thing/ Oh my god oh my god oh my god,"" constitutes the most
    moving musical climax I've heard this year.  While some are put off by the over-the-top, undeniably
    confrontational nature of Xiu Xiu's music, it's the very willingness to overstep conventionally accepted
    boundaries of expression that renders their music so incredibly affecting.</p><p>
    
    The relatively sparse, largely acoustic arrangements of <i>Fag Patrol</i> don't allow for the terrifying
    transcendence of ""Apistat Commander"", but they do allow Stewart to twist the idea of ""acoustic intimacy""
    into something perverse, voyeuristic, unexpected, and often beautifully disturbing.  ""Helsabot"", the first
    track on <i>Fag Patrol</i>, and one of two previously unreleased originals, sets the tone for the acoustic
    portions of the record, as Stewart sings with a potent mixture of regret, reflection, and conspicuously
    constrained passion.  Stewart's voice is right at the front of the mix, dominating a subdued acoustic
    guitar, every uncomfortable breath and awkward, searching silence intact.  When, after one such silence,
    Stewart returns with a whispered, ""Do your pants ever just fall off off off,"" the effect is absolutely
    chilling.  The oft-discussed ""I Broke Up"" receives a similar acoustic treatment, the song's notorious
    scream replaced by a venomous whisper that is ultimately much more powerful.</p><p>
<i>Fag Patrol</i>'s other two unreleased tracks are standouts: ""Nieces Pieces"" sets Stewart's voice against
    a backdrop of decaying strings, as he sings of all the dark secrets his niece can look forward to discovering.
    Far from a touching tale about retaining the innocence of youth, Stewart touches on both the perpetuation of
    dysfunction within a family, and how, often, gaining awareness of that very dysfunction serves as its own
    coming-of-age ritual.  Stewart's interpretation of The Smiths' ""Asleep"", also available here for the first
    time, conveys not only Stewart's deep understanding and appreciation of an incredible song, but his ability
    to convey the emotional heft of such a song without delving into melodrama for the sole purpose of cheap
    theatrics.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, for all its hushed whispers, swallowed confessions, and short, gasping breaths, it's difficult to
    perceive <i>Fag Patrol</i> as even remotely insincere.  If anything, the record demonstrates that, behind
    the layers of screeching and noise that many listeners find so alienating, Jamie Stewart is an extremely
    talented singer and songwriter, expertly crafting melody and using his voice in ways that most people would
    consider untenable, if not downright rude.  It may be mostly acoustic, but <i>Fag Patrol</i> is by no means
    an easy listen-- just as it begins to draw you in, it stands poised to rip you apart or, worse, taint the
    whole experience with a single, understated, disturbing utterance.  If that isn't intimate, then I don't
    know what is.</p></div>"|8823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8823-fag-patrol/|7.8|Matt LeMay

    brow, the other shrugged his overburdened shoulders beneath the weight of his companion.  Upon hearing the horrific cry ripped from the throat of Daedalus, they knew the game 
    had gone too far.  When the last of the padded leather costume was shed they quickly squinted toward the horizon to see, falling from the sky, the body of the young boy they had come to 
    pay homage to, his graceless and pinioned form careening inevitably into the distant Aegean Sea.</p><p>
    Initially, it seemed like a good idea coaxing the old inventor through his complex and intimidating technological exercise.  After all, the strategy seemed to work on their latest 
    release, <i>Six Soviet Misfits</i>, a two-disc collection of the group's previously released <i>UL-6</i> EP, <i>Soviet Igloo</i> 12"", and <i>Misfits</i> LP.  The idea was to utilize a 
    series of black boxes functioning as micro-labyrinths-- through which only chance bits of data are allowed to pass-- that would inevitably reconfigure information via wires and 
    circuitry boards as something unexpectedly musical.  The group's hope was that by donning the guise of the Cretan half-man/half-bull and pushing Daedalus and his son through 
    the real labyrinth, the mythological duo would happen upon something equally interesting and novel.  Unfortunately, Brown, Britton and ultimately Icarus pay the price for this tinkering, 
    as the formulaic approach builds expectations that are seldom satisfied.</p><p>
    Of course, there could be no opportunity for a fall if anticipation weren't raised to a heightened level.  ""Benevolent Incubator"" begins with a jazzy swarm of percussion instruments-- 
    including the ever-present skittering snare-- that gives way to a beautiful melody anchored by a handful of extended tones and the warm hum of various computer generated noises that finally 
    usher it to conclusion.  Organic and cohesive, the composition sets the bar high for the remainder of the album, which never fully meets the mark again.  While compositions like 
    ""Borichean Pintak"" and ""Nine Fresian"" contain moments of uncluttered beauty that parallel ""Incubator""-- utilizing minimal drum-programs and sighing electronic manipulations that give 
    both tracks a haunting element-- they eventually devolve into the lowest common denominator: predictable, uninteresting dance music.</p><p>
    ""Xot Zoiks"", ""Despair"" and ""UL-6"" attempt to circumvent this potentially crippling fault by supplementing the musical ideas of various other electronic luminaries like 
    Boards of Canada, Autechre, and Plaid, but unfortunately, instead of fleshing out the music, the tonal clusters, distorted beats, and jazz-inflected bass serve only to illuminate the duo's 
    shortcomings in light of their inspirations.  This leads to the aural equivalent of counterfeit inspection-- leaving it up to the listener to hold each piece of sound up to the light in order to search 
    for the watermark of originality, a task both tedious and annoying.</p><p>
    As Icarus and Daedalus discovered, context is potentially more harmful to the creative process than imitation-- specifically, the available tools and employed methods of the artist.  It's 
    at the hand of their own limited musical palette that Brown and Britton fail in their misadventure, as similar to the old man quickly throwing together precarious materials in a bid to exit the cold 
    confines of the labyrinth, the group produces an album that feels rushed, weak, and too eager to flee its roots in drum 'n bass and jungle.  Like Icarus approaching the white heat of his demise, 
    the musical counterpart can only bear witness to the consequence of a half-realized album that, though it never quite kisses the earth with gossamer wings, is as equally unfastened by the warm 
    radiant glow of its aspirations.</p></div>"|4044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4044-six-soviet-misfits/|5.4|Andrew Bryant

So a     good way to become enamored with Fahey's catalog is to just pick any track fixated on a woman, and go from     there: ""Impressions of Susan"", ""A Raga Called Pat"", ""Requiem for Molly"", ""Beverly"", ""Juana"", or on this     particular disc, ""Marilyn"". Each lady is lovely, dark, ultimately unknowable. Is Juana really a waitress in     Oregon?  Was Molly really out on Knott's Berry Farm?  Who was this Marilyn?</p>
<p>She is lush yet sad, and that might even be her squinched up on the cover, painfully reclining and staring     out into space. When Fahey is playing her, it's at a much slower pace than the rest of the first side of     this 1974 reissue. Second guitarist Woodrow Mann's second guitar glistens across Fahey's lead, each taking     their sweet time in waving goodbye to her. The small diversions they take along every line are as exceptionally     awkward as any of Thelonious Monk's irregularly melodic spurs, yet for all the unhurried and dissonant     playing, the quickly picked finale shines a brighter hue on this lovely figure.</p>
<p>Apart from the ladies, this particular session shows how Fahey's talents took him much further afield of the     blues path than most people will credit him for. Here he tackles in succession ""In a Persian Market"" and the     Hindu chant ""Jaya Shiva Shankarah"", the two guitars twining around their Byzantine themes with a heck of a     lot of flange, giving the fluctuating fingerpicked patterns a secondary weaving of soundwaves.</p>
<p>""Old Fashioned Love"" is prime Fahey playing in its own right, but with the midway appearance of the old     timey orchestra consisting of jug, banjo, clarinet, tuba, trumpet, trombone, piano, and drums, the ditty goes     to a place seldom heard elsewhere in the man's catalog. The affected cymbal crash at the end also gives it     an odd modern spin that confounds them ornery notions of time and nostalgia. John was never that easy to     glean. ""Boodle Am Shake"" sounds straight off the shellac itself, Fahey blending into the background of the     ensemble perfectly and sending up that wonderfully ridiculous refrain-- it's the one of the few instances     of standard singing in his oeuvre.</p>
<p>Fred McDowell's standard ""Keep Your Light Trimmed and Burning"" is recast here as a 1920s big band number to     excellent effect, the Fahey arrangement a particular surprise. Very rarely would he work with so many attuned     musicians before or after this point. The set closes with one of his truly magical works, ""Dry Bones in the     Valley (I Saw the Light Coming Shining 'Round and 'Round)"", which was a gateway for many through the cover     version exacted with Tony Conrad on Gastr del Sol's <i>Upgrade and Afterlife</i> set. The effects are off,     the session musicians sent home, and it's a beatific example of Fahey's opened steel strings resonating into     the infinite, droning yet with numerous emotional contours unfurling in the chiming notes.  It may have aged     28 years, but <i>Old Fashioned Love</i> remains a consistently surprising collection of Fahey's many loves.</p></div>"|2946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2946-old-fashioned-love/|8.4|Andy Beta

After the precursory spinning
    of mental rolodexes amidst have-you-seen-so-and-so-latelys, she made it known that she is now a part of the
    lost art of millinery. The yellow fedora of La bohème is her latest creation. ""It is a dying trade,"" she
    whispered, ""because of the quality of buckram. It's the foundation of the industry, and the machines that
    sew the material make lower thread counts; the very threads themselves are just weaker these days. They
    just don't make buckram like they used to."" From pink pirate hats to tilted trucker caps, they were all
    done better back in the old days!</p><p>
    So, as I slump at the café, staring moribund at my chinos gone threadbare at the knees, I echo the sentiments
    of ""Summer Clothes"" off of Coloma's second release, wanting ""to wear the clothes that summer wears,"" in all
    its light fabric fits. I swear it will be the hit of the summer, fit for all café dwellers, mostly because
    there's always something there to remind me of that bygone era still ripe for nostalgic plucking and preening.</p><p>
    For those who pine that The Postal Service were more Anglo, without the pink Death Cab for Cutie baby-tee,
    enter the stylish Le Corte Ingles of Coloma, two British ex-pats now residing in Köln, Germany.  While Alex
    Paulick neo-romances the programming of Baroque strings and lingering xylophones cut-n-clicked back together
    again in a tasteful, unassuming early 80s style, Rob Taylor croaks and croons through a buttoned-down throat
    bothered with both Jarvis Cocker's aesthetic headaches and Bryan Ferry's decadent migraines, his head
    splitting at the seams with painful observations of the hip and hideous.</p><p>
    His world is full of well-dressed assholes and slumming primadonnas, their visages parading as sensorial
    barrage: ""With their impossible skin and collagen Charles Atlas lips/ Courting the Italian waiter and
    whistling at the rose-sellers/ When in comes a shower of rickenbacker bricklayer hairgel dumbbell goodfellas.""
    Of course, he's not exactly innocent himself, as there's hair dye on his hands as well when he indicts
    himself on the epic rendering, ""The Tailor"": ""I don't do sincerity, I couldn't run a mile/ I don't offer
    guarantees, but I've got a lot of style."" As the dignified violin strokes fall apart at the seams, tearing
    into static, Taylor makes a clean breast of it, admitting, ""I am the Dream Weaver, this is the life I chose/
    I'm the tailor who sews the Emperor's clothes,"" revealing his own nakedness in the final wrung breath.</p><p>
    ""The Second Closer Still"" sutures a sneering lip quiver to Lithops-like hiccups, while the more uptempo
    ""If You Can't Be Good"", is Farley Jackmaster Funk with a xylophone on the touchpad throb. ""Illegible Love""
    has all the saxy caress and satiny rustle of Wham's Vaseline-lensed classic, ""Careless Whisper"".  Elsewhere,
    the tracks are as barbed as any sewing needle threaded with strands of tainted love.</p><p>
    Where Coloma sticks through is in their persistence of vision. The images tumble past quicker than a parade
    of bulimic models at a Jello-shot slicked staircase, glossy and grotesque as they collapse. There's also
    that singular feeling Taylor enunciates as ""falling like a goose down feather dropped from a tenth story
    window sill"" that makes me swoon. Coloma remains tempered throughout, with every electronic fiber and silken
    sigh in its right place, proving that a knife lies within every sharp-dressed man.</p></div>"|1548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1548-finery/|7.9|Andy Beta

At shows, I would concentrate on remaining as still as possible, allowing only
    a tapping foot or nodding head to express any enthusiasm I had for the performer.  When confronted with
    commercial radio, I would sneer and mime symptoms of illness, bemoaning the factory-produced facelessness
    of pop music.  My head was full of a taxonomy categorizing all artists I came across as ""authentic"" or
    ""contrived,"" as judged by their biography, label affiliation, and oh yeah, occasionally, their music.</p><p>
    For years, I saw absolutely nothing wrong with this behavior, considering my musical health robust, even
    vibrant.  But after an appointment with the vaunted Dr. People, I realized I was suffering from a rare
    illness: Indie Guilt Syndrome, or IGS for short.  Though I thought my listening diet was healthily balanced,
    Dr. People diagnosed me with a serious deficiency of Vitamin F(un), which led to excessive behavorial
    inhibition during shows and caused me to miss out on hundreds of irresistibly catchy and fascinating
    songs against which I'd been prejudiced based on sales figures.  To treat this condition, the good doctor
    prescribed a revolutionary new cure: Junior Senior's <i>D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat</i>.</p><p>
    Chances are, your only exposure to Junior Senior thus far has been the Fatboy Slim-endorsed ""Move Your Feet"",
    a track that happens to be the most stereotypically Euro on this record, layered as it is with three coats
    of rayon keyboard and a raspy diva shouting for global unity via <i>the dance!</i>  It's a strong club track,
    but probably a bit of a deep-end dive for tourists from the land of singer/songwriter moping and fiercely
    proud lo-fidelity.  Fortunately, the remainder of the <i>D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat</i> is easier to
    swallow for IGS sufferers, as Junior Senior draw their inspiration less from disco/techno clubland than
    from the classic rock dial.  ""Boy Meets Girl"", f'rinstance, combines the psych-organ groove of early
    Traffic, cowbell-banging from ""Honky Tonk Woman"", and Kool &amp; The Gang woo-hoo!'s, while ""Shake Me Baby""
    speaks of wanting to be ""your tambourine man"" in a gleefully approximate Dylan impression.  (If either
    fails to get you off wallflower detail, your IGS may be approaching the terminal stage.)</p><p>
    Sure, this duo's wacky sexual-orientation hijinx (Junior is straight, Senior is gay, and boy, they don't
    let you forget it) are a bit gimmicky, but it's not like the popular duos of the indie rock world are
    publicity stunt-free.  Plus, the backstory allows for lovably loopy songs like the raucous ""Chicks and
    Dicks"", the ""I'm a Little Bit Country, I'm a Little Bit Rock 'n' Roll"" of gay/straight relations.  Brimful
    of the unbridled horniness of ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" but without the hetero constraints of Mötley Crüe,
    the song contains the humanist message that Junior Senior will fuck any and <i>everyone</i>.</p><p>
    Lyrically, the subject matter runs the philosophical gamut from ""move yo body!"" to ""rock da house!"", but
    for every moment that triggers the cheese reflex (pretty much all of ""Shake Your Coconuts""), there's a sly
    wink.  The frantic ""White Trash"" declares, ""We wanna be like Nancy and Lee,"" a reference semi-obscure enough
    to appeal to long-time IGS sufferers.  Not that you'll care much, as you hop along to songs like ""Rhythm
    Bandits"" and ""Good Girl, Bad Boy"", each alternating between hard-beat drum-and-chant verses and explosive
    go-go cage choruses.</p><p>
    Sounding as much like playful garage-rock as cocky Europop, it's telling that one can easily imagine a
    unifying DJ set playlist where The Rapture's ""I Need Your Love"" segues into ""Move Your Feet"" segues into
    Justin Timberlake's ""Rock Your Body"".  I don't mean to pressure you into the embrace of dance music--
    many people live long, productive lives with IGS-- but if you're starting to chafe at the constrictions
    of the indie lifestyle, if your feet insisted upon doing more than just tapping at that last Dismemberment
    Plan show, and if you've repeatedly caught yourself humming ""Cry Me a River"" while you Kinko's your zine,
    consider Junior Senior as treatment for Indie Guilt Syndrome. </p><p>

They wrap themselves in bright white
    uniforms, evoking a dyadic dance-obsessed schism of The Polyphonic Spree and the anesthetized crispness
    of fresh bedsheets in a sentimental commercial for stain-lifting detergent. Sonically, they craft danceable
    punk-out rave-ups circling around a synthesizer, male group shouts, and heavily groove-based drums.  And on
    <i>We Are from Nowhere</i>-- their first full-length after an out-of-print, tour-only seven-inch-- Kevin
    Disco (no relation to Bis' John Disco) and Matt Howze opt for moving one's ass as a fun way to break a
    sweat.  Regrettably, though, these cats' vision isn't adventurous or expansive enough: they rarely vary
    their aesthetic scope beyond the obvious stereo-electro start/stop clutter, and as such, the results are
    more symptomatic of current trend-following than some dynomite block party.</p><p>
    
    On a more positive note, half the songs are over five minutes (the longest clocks in just under seven),
    which is a respectable length for aiding and abetting getting one's groove on. But part and parcel to a
    seemingly endless stream of post-millennial dancepunk groups, Dance Disaster Movement simply meld ESG,
    mid-career P.I.L., Devo, A Certain Ratio, and, whether they realize it or not, the vastly forgotten
    Silver Apples into an easily digestible pabulum.  And beyond being just another album in a line of
    similitude, <i>We Are from Nowhere</i> suffers from internal homogeneity: Dance Disaster Movement fail to
    diversify the dance moves much during the album's eight unsurprising tracks-- most of which unfurl amid
    equivalent patterning: ebb - two beats - flow - two beats - ebb - fill - flow, etc - give or take a beat.</p><p>
    
    But perhaps this isn't a lapse of historical or aesthetic vision: DDM could possibly be hemmed-in by the
    limitations of their retro gear, or their inability to use the shit to its full potential. The Omni keyboard,
    released by Arp in 1976, is an analog synthesizer with four separate voices (monophonic cello and bass,
    polyphonic viola and violin) and a bass/synthesizer section. The strings, synth, and bass synth are all
    simultaneously available. That's a lot of action. And there are two oscillators per voice.  Kevin Disco,
    though, can't seem to get his to do much beyond mid-Victorian rapid-fire oscillating burps.</p><p>
    
    The song structures themselves are also fairly formulaic: as is often the case with this kind of thing,
    there are far too many build-ups that lead to a crescendo. The seed is forever spilled. Also, there's
    usually some sort of discordant twang of a guitar or simulated string running counter to the general flow
    of the other instruments.  It becomes a catchphrase halfway through.</p><p>
    
    However, one of the stronger compositions, ""The Shots"", offers some punk-rock chutzpah-- a likable anthem
    about escaping to the mountains, reminiscent of P.I.L.'s ""Rise"" without Johnny R's wide-eyed charisma, the
    song boasts: ""Got my head in the clouds/ My middle finger is up.""  The strongest bit on the album,  ""I Want
    Your Sass"", moves between tempo shifts, and remains enjoyable despite endless scatterbrain shouts of (yes)
    ""I want your sass"": It begins like Julie Ruin, moves into Stereolab territory, cozies up to the Blues
    Explosion and the angularity of Six Finger Satellite, chills outs a bit, and flies past full of nervous
    energy and sugary hooks. Keep context in mind, though; it's also the first track, at which point you're
    still innocent to the fact that, aside from two forgettable videogame-digitally-analog-skipping instrumentals,
    you're going to have to deal with basically the same song with slight variations for the next half hour.</p><p>
    
    By the second number, the slower-paced ""C'est La Vie"", the pattern recognition has already begun to emerge.
    Midway through, Disco announces: ""Don't you even think the beat will make a change!""  That's the problem, man,
    it doesn't!  Though select tracks off <i>We Are from Nowhere</i> would nicely compliment a living room
    dance party, <i>We Are from Nowhere</i> just doesn't offer enough respite from Dance Disaster Movement's
    synthesized sameness to maintain any sort of boogie-woogie, let alone kickstart an entire movement.</p></div>"|2160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2160-we-are-from-nowhere/|6.5|Brandon Stosuy

Now, I swear, I can smile
    and nod as well as the next dude.  Maybe better.  It's not as easy as you might think to drag me into the
    cynical pop Philistinism that prevents so many of my indie brethren from enjoying themselves.  Even I have
    my limits, though, and when it comes to Electric Six's debut full-length, even the vaunted ""pop defense""--
    the Johnny Cochran of all justifications for idiotic music-- can't win this case.  If Andrew W.K. hadn't
    gone out of his way to lower a common denominator that was already quite low enough, thanks, these repellent
    schlock-rockers would have taken care of it.  All of you, every last one who defended <i>I Get Wet</i>'s
    slope-browed Anthems of Commerce as anything other than pandering, mindless escapism, reap the terrifying
    fruits of your labor: <i>Fire</i>.</p><p>
    Is it that I don't ""get"" the Electric Six?  Believe me, I get it; it's just that once I got it, I started
    looking for a way to get rid of it.  When snarling frontman Dick Valentine subjects me to lyrics like, ""I've
    got something to put in you/ At the gay bar,"" I just wonder if, upon the crazy success of their incredible
    disco/rock hybrid, ""Danger! High Voltage"", these guys simply decided it was easier to just give up than to
    try topping it.  Granted, it's not all as sophomorically abominable as ""Gay Bar""; some of it's actually even
    kinda funny, in a Men Without Hats sorta way (""Radio message from HQ/ Dance commander, we love you""), but
    let's be direct: these guys mention ""fire"" in nearly every song (that, or ""going to war"" on the dancefloor),
    and the subject of ""Naked Pictures"" is none other than-- whoa-ho-ho!-- your mother.</p><p>
    Clunky power-chord progressions, tinny percussion, and distant synths complete the gruesome aura of kitsch
    surrounding <i>Fire</i>-- and that wouldn't be <i>so</i> bad if we could at least dismiss it as pure novelty.
    If only there wasn't that lingering sense of vacuous sincerity.  Electric Six, like Andrew W.K. before them,
    are not in the business of satire.  However: if it's really all fun and games, as the staggeringly insipid
    Detroit six-piece might lead you to believe, the music doesn't give it away.  80s rock clichés abound-- but
    just subtly enough to imply that the band was either too musically incompetent to follow through to the
    point of parody, or just didn't give a shit that they are, in essence, a very sincere hair-rock band.  Even
    the ballad here-- a love song to a synthesizer-- is drenched in beamingly heartfelt bleach-blond solos and
    soaring, Winger-esque keyboards.</p><p>
    But hold up, it's confession time: until my HMO approves my elective surgery, I'm not made of stone.  And
    even though many of these songs are steaming retro-piles, and the lyrical content here often makes a fatal
    car crash seem pleasant by comparison, Electric Six actually bothered to throw in a few songs that are
    genuinely, unabashedly entertaining.  Slightly funky guitar lines skirt along the edge of power ballad
    territory, while Valentine dives completely over the edge on the laughably earnest, yet surprisingly upbeat
    ""I'm the Bomb"".  Title aside, it's the band's most serious moment, and proves to be a fairly even blend of
    bouncy, disposable pop and just enough real meaning, or sentiment, to sustain interest.  ""Synthesizer"", the
    aforementioned techno-serenade, closes the album immediately afterward on an equally positive note; the
    loopy, whistling synth tropes are at least a decent counter to the time they spend mining hair-metal
    elsewhere.</p><p>
    And yes, ""Danger! High Voltage"", the surprise British dance hit of '02, is reprised wonderfully, forming
    the only truly illuminating cut to be found on <i>Fire</i>.  The steamy sax action and rattling, echoing
    guitar-funk has all of the original's overwhelming urgency, and then some, thanks to co-yelps from Jack
    White.  After having put me through Whirlwind Heat, I was sure that Jack and I would meet in the afterlife
    as enemies on the vast battlefields of Valhalla, but his desperate screaming offsets Valentine's sneering
    rumble perfectly, achieving an almost impossibly frantic tone.  The band never even comes close to that
    level of unrestrained might anywhere else; the only other song that succeeds similarly-- in spite of wading
    hip-deep through the prevalent 80s rock clichés-- is ""Electric Demons in Love"".  And even that remains too
    rigidly tied to Def Leppardisms to pass as anything greater than a basic achievement of its aim.</p><p>
    So that's my dirty little secret: in spite of myself, I like a few of these songs. I only hope that my
    earlier warnings are sobering enough to put it all in perspective.  As good as ""Danger! High Voltage"" is,
    the rest of this album is simply not worth it.  Fortunately, you can just pick up the single for half the
    price, and without having to put yourself through this hairy mess.</p></div>"|2733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2733-fire/|4.0|Eric Carr

I'd wager that
    perhaps not a single person reading this site has ever been to a cinema where a real, live piano player
    sat and soundtracked a silent film as it played.  The practice pretty much ended in the 30s, as silent
    films died and gave rise to their talking descendents.  You can imagine how progressive it must have seemed
    in the late 1920s when moviegoers were first able to see Al Jolson moving his mouth on screen while
    simultaneously hearing his voice from in-theater speakers.</p><p>
    
    As it became possible in the early 30s to record sound directly to film-- thus eliminating synching issues
    that had plagued early ""talkies"", as they were known-- film scoring gave way entirely to the process we're
    familiar with today: a score is composed, recorded and subsequently dubbed into the film's audio track (and,
    of course, marketed as an album and sold in tandem with the film).  Those early cinemas with their pianos by
    the stage faded into quaint memories, along with most of the performers who worked there every night,
    highlighting the drama, the comedy, and the romance that played out on the screen above them.</p><p>
    
    Decades upon decades later, in an entirely new century, the idea of having musicians in the room performing
    a score while you watch a movie is an almost completely foreign one.  Prerecorded scores are now the only
    accompaniment we're accustomed to, and as such, the idea of people improvising to a film feels progressive
    all over again.  But throwback or no, Califone's <i>Deceleration</i> series (the band issued <i>One</i> last
    year) is an eminently worthwhile project, comprising the band's live, improvised scores to short films
    created by acquaintances.</p><p>
<i>Deceleration One</i> was a fantastically powerful recording, cinematic in an altogether different sense.
    And though its follow-up was recorded at the same time as the original (February 2002)-- as well as the
    circumstances surrounding its recording-- it's a very different beast, favoring steadier rhythm and much
    busier accompaniment.  Whereas <i>Deceleration One</i> scored a series of film loops and Ladislaw Starewicz's
    short film <i>The Mascot</i>, and its general tone could best be described as largely ambient, this album
    functions as the score to three distinct films (Brent Green's <i>Francis</i>, Jeff Economy's <i>Fireworks
    (No Mail Days Are Sad Days)</i>, and Alla Navimova's <i>Salome</i>), which allows for a wider diversity in
    sound.</p><p>
    
    Of these films, <i>Francis</i> is the only one I've actually seen, thanks primarily to its inclusion as a
    multimedia track on Califone's most recent proper full-length, <i>Quicksand/Cradlesnakes</i>.  Its score,
    a wildly percussive piece of music, opens this disc, marking an instant departure from the elegiac tones
    of <i>Deceleration One</i>.  The warm, swelling synths and squawking guitars that found their way onto much
    of the last record are present, but the mood is like none the band has committed to tape before; though
    initially accompanied by tribal drums, the six-minute piece eventually morphs into a fantastic R&amp;B; groove,
    then back into another polyrhythmic drum freakout, and finally departs with only the gentle buzzing of a
    synthesizer or two.</p><p>
    
    The three pieces performed for Economy's <i>Fireworks (No Mail Days Are Sad Days)</i>, meanwhile, are
    fiercely, stubbornly chaotic-- almost brutal at points-- especially for a soundtrack to something with
    such a whimsical title.  Your enjoyment of these pieces will be a direct reflection of your tolerance for
    crunching bursts of noise, outright lack of structural contour, and gratuitous space echo.  It's a freakish
    pile of piano, amplifier noise, cymbal, found object percussion, and other assorted slop that never seems
    to arrive at any apex or reach any particular destination.</p><p>
    
    The album's second half, though, makes it all worth sitting through.  I imagine <i>Salome</i> to be a
    beautiful film, if the music is any indication.  The piece is split into twelve tracks, but flows seamlessly
    from point to point, settling into softly whirring synth and mandolin eddies, and bursting forth in rushes
    of shimmering noise with incredible, telepathic grace.  The band even puts the funk hammer down on a
    breathtaking section called ""She Dances"", guitars scratching away with wah pedals to the metal, posing all
    kinds of intriguing questions as to what could happen if Califone grafted their signature junkyard folk
    onto this chassis.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, widely distributed films aren't like to see live scores these days, but with their <i>Deceleration</i>
    series, Califone have made a hell of a case for, at the very least, using live improvisation as a method of
    composing scores.  Anyone who digs Pink Floyd's early soundtrack work (especially <i>More</i>), is almost
    sure to love this stuff, and the <i>Salome</i> section is one of the most outright enjoyable pieces of
    improvised music I've ever heard.  Film music rarely gets more dynamic or challenging than this.</p></div>"|1239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1239-deceleration-two/|8.0|Joe Tangari

It's the purest tone possible, a smooth wave without overtones.  A sine wave, if
    reproduced properly, sounds exactly the same as another sine wave at the same frequency. Perhaps because
    few sounds in nature are true sine waves (some insects come close), we associate sine waves with machines.
    Ryoji Ikeda builds much of his music from sine waves, and the tone of his music reflects an abstract,
    mechanized and mathematical world. Ikeda has made some mind-blowing music that, to me, doesn't sound
    particularly human. It's music that seems pulled from some philosophical plane and injected directly into
    my brain.</p><p>
    
    But Ikeda's ideas are only part of the sine wave story. I wonder if-- for American kids, at least-- a
    lifetime of exposure to the emergency broadcast system tests hasn't given sine waves a twinge of humanizing
    nostalgia. I remember tests while <i>Electric Company</i> played, and I remembered the real thing when a
    tornado would touch down in the area. I hear sine waves now and it triggers vague memories of being huddled
    with my family in a damp basement with the radio on, hearing the branches rattling against the house as the
    wind whipped outside: ""Bzzzzz. This is the Emergency Broadcast System... a tornado warning is in effect
    for..."" The familiar EBS tone was not actually a sine wave; the combination of two tones, 853 Hz and 960
    Hz, gave the sound a slightly grating edge meant to signal ""danger."" But it was close, and it was the kind
    of thing you paid attention to when you were a kid. The EBS tone, though ostensibly a warning, had a certain
    comfort to it.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Computer Recital</i>, Lullatone has found a way to take sine waves and arrange them into soft, gentle
    little lullabies, and I can't help but wonder if Shawn Seymour (Lullatone's driving force) feels a similar
    sense of nostalgia.  This is music that instantly seems connected to pleasant childhood memories.  Lullatone
    gets some of his warmth from the sine waves by not being a purist.  While he makes regular use of clean
    tones, he mixes them with tones enriched with a dollop of harmonic distortion, in addition to tossing in
    some other instruments occasionally. So you get some organ, little hints of percussion, and even a subtle
    vocal.</p><p>
    
    Lullatone's melodies are the repetitive and sequenced sort that minimalist composers added to music's
    vocabulary, and though tracks are easy enough to tell apart, the mood from one to the next varies little.
    <i>Computer Recital</i> is a calm, clean, reflective musical space that seems intimately connected with
    sounds coming from Japan, despite Lullatone's home base in Louisville. More than any single record, <i>Computer
    Recital</i> reminds me of the patient, measured melodicism of Nobukazu Takemura collaborator Aki Tsuyuko's
    solo album <i>Ongakushitsu</i>.  It definitely sounds like something that could have come out on Childisc
    (witness titles like ""Coloring"" and ""Plastic Toy Record Player""), and, deepening the connection, Lullatone's
    only other release is a split-single with Takemura alias Child's View.</p><p>
    
    Even with these obvious inspirations, Lullatone doesn't seem derivative-- or, more accurately, the fact that
    it <i>may be</i> derivative doesn't much matter.  There's something in <i>Computer Recital</i>'s single-minded
    pursuit of simple beauty that personalizes the record. Everything about it radiates smallness and intimacy;
    it's intended for one-on-one communication, and hence, consideration of outside references seems unimportant
    and possibly even intrusive. The only requirements for enjoying <i>Computer Recital</i> are ears and the
    ability to daydream.</p></div>"|4912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4912-computer-recital/|7.4|Mark Richardson

    carefully gelled hair cluster in the center of a white, columned room, encircled by a string of blood-red
    roses.  Middle guy wears lots of jewelry and holds a flower to his chest.  Precious!  Above them, in a rich
    gold font, lie the dreadful words, ""Pleasure Forever.""  Note the infinity symbol separating the two halves
    of that phrase.  *shudder*</p><p>
    
    Had I purged myself of all familiarity with this band, disregarding the little Sub Pop box slapped proudly
    on <i>Alter</i>'s binding, I'd have expected some riotously bad Daniel Bedingfield-inspired dance tracks.
    Instead, I smirked, chuckled glibly, and mentally filed <i>Alter</i> away as a preposterously solid example
    of why we should never, ever judge a record by its cover.</p><p>
    
    Pleasure Forever only <i>look</i> dissolute. There's a little bit of the grown-men-standing-in-a-circle-of-roses
    to their sound-- these are opulent, dark, glammy songs, tugged around by cabaret-style piano lines-- but
    Pleasure Forever are also a fine, thrashing rock band with some heavily distorted guitar and lots of rough,
    lecherous vocals.  Things may go tribal and occasionally skew a little bit goth, but they never lean toward
    the kind of greasy, sordid beat-bopping implied by <i>Alter</i>'s Euro-creepy package.</p><p>
    
    The band hails from sunny San Francisco, and have been known, at various points, as The VSS (then with
    Sonny Kay) and Slaves; their current incarnation is a smarmy three-man circus dedicated to wedding bits of
    prog indulgence with post-punk brooding and early metal noise-- to secure yourself a more specific prototype,
    conjure the freaky crossbreed of Interpol (whom, to be fair, they effectively pre-date), The Jesus Lizard,
    and Nick Cave's Bad Seeds.  They don't sound like much you've heard before. </p><p>
    
    Each of <i>Alter</i>'s twelve tracks are structurally slippery, shifting seamlessly from style to style in
    a way that makes it almost impossible to accurately map their paths.  The subsequent mazes can be disorienting,
    but it's the most thrilling brand of dementia, as well as an acute reminder of the tension and balance true
    songwriting prowess can build.  This is not rote, predictable stuff. </p><p>
    
    ""Czarina"" opens with jingly, resonant piano and airy, rollicking drums; the song eventually breaks itself
    down into a gritty, single-string guitar fight, heavy and addictively thick. ""Aeon Flame"" twists a bouncy
    synth line with dicey percussion and guitar, allowing all three elements build to tiny climaxes and peppering
    the track with unexpectedly cathartic bursts.  By five minutes in, Andrew Rothbard's profoundly distorted
    voice has spiraled into something entirely otherworldly, sneaking toward Thom Yorke vocals-as-just-another-noisy-instrument
    territory, and becoming almost entirely indistinct from Joshua Hughes' fuzzy, spectral guitar.</p><p>
    
    Rothbard's copiously fuzzed vocals, while never tedious, can occasionally get a little impenetrable; Pleasure
    Forever's self-titled debut proved that his pipes justify at least a few moments of unadulterated, plain old
    singing.  In more questionable moments, the vox evoke a heavily eyelinered, squealing Scott Weiland, but it's
    Rothbard's piano tinkering that consistently pulls Pleasure Forever from the pits of overindulgence,
    providing already-packed songs with additional rich, curious melodies and spots of light.</p><p>
    
    The transposition of keys and feisty percussion with feral vocals and wild guitar wrangling is, ultimately,
    what's most interesting here: the juxtaposition is dynamic, if occasionally unsettling, and steeps in a kind
    of nasty, drunken licentiousness.  It's hard to say why, specifically-- Rothbard's lyrics are apocalyptic
    but certifiably obscure (""Caressed solace of oceans sinking/ Liquified sky of fishes drinking/ Driving drifts
    to flash flood finish/ This is the Zodiac speaking""), and the band's instrumentation is clever enough to
    endure any number of interpretations.  Only their dark, sinister atmospherics can be properly linked to the
    cryptic, inexplicably black synergy of these three men and their instruments.  I don't know what roses have
    to do with it.</p></div>"|6346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6346-alter/|8.4|Amanda Petrusich

    percussion jams to Manchester's Hacienda club, and how 70s disco boogied into Jamaica on the <i>Hustle!</i>
    comp.</p><p>
    
    This time around, they focus on a most peculiar connection between two genres-- American hip-hop
    and Jamaican dancehall-- proving them to be Siamese twins joined at the hip. The very bedrock of hip-hop--
    DJs Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash-- are both of Jamaican descent, modeling their turntable set-ups on the
    soundclash sound systems of their youth. Run-DMC collaborated with albino toaster Yellowman years before
    pasty burnouts Aerosmith. Stars like Lauryn Hill and KRS-One base hits on dancehall staples. And now
    dancehall stars like Sean Paul and Shaggy are crossing over into Hot 97's pervasive mix.</p><p>
    
    That the knee-jerk response to Shaggy's ""Gunshot"" is of crouching booty shakes is testament to the bass
    frequencies found here. Spraying a frantic flow over a bouncing beat shot through with Otis Redding samples,
    there's no trace of his later noxious hit ""It Wasn't Me"".  Long-time staples of hip-hop DJ sets, Tenor Saw's
    ""Ring the Alarm"" and Dawn Penn's ""No No No"" are thankfully present, too, concisely showing the connections
    between the two island sounds.</p><p>
    
    Kenny Dope (of Masters at Work) chops up A Tribe Called Quest for dancehall MC Screechy Dan and hip-hop
    producer J Live swirls an Augustus Pablo sample around a straight-ahead American head nod. While maintaining
    a studio shine, dancehall boasts elaborate double-jointed rhythms that drop in and out as the track plays,
    a change-up seldom found in most radio hits, plying different voices as the beats morph instead of looping
    a beat ad infinitum.</p><p>
    
    The island patois and fierce flows show the most engaging aspect of dancehall is the vocal textures, be they
    croaking or nasally clean. The absolute mutant growl by Pompidoo on the primitive ""Synthesizer Voice"" (taking
    Biz Markie's ""Ah One Two"" tongue buzz to full bloom in '85) is odd as fuck-- after all, it shared a label
    with Mantronix and Arthur Russell back in the day. Jumping ahead twenty years, Ward 21 croaks in a flat flow
    that sounds like Timbaland's phoned-in baritone before it gets jacked by a more frantic and brash spit that's
    lies at the other extreme, cutting between the two throats expertly.</p><p>
    
    The craziest joint, though, is the Missy-like bleep-bounce of Ms. Thing's ""Get That Money"", in which she
    raps over a digital dot-dash in vocode while men bark back: ""Ladies get that cash and 'ave fun/ Get your
    face and hair and nails done."" Even Dr. Dre's ""Next Episode"" makeover of David Axelrod gets a facial with
    equal aplomb from the UK's Singer Blue on ""If I Know Jah"".</p><p>
    
    Not content to be a mere curatorial comp of dancehall or hip-hop, <i>Nice Up the Dance</i> transcends other
    genre-tasters with the ease in which it cuts between the two sides, noting all variants of the amalgamation.
    That every track also works for ""playing doctor"" on the dancefloor makes for a fine-ass corpus.</p></div>"|1988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1988-nice-up-the-dance/|8.0|Andy Beta

Central
    Indiana, like central Illinois, central Iowa, and many other Midwestern centrals, is carpeted with a
    waist-high forest of corn and soybeans, stretched out on ironed-flat topography.  Flying over the region
    you can see all the farms drawn out into perfect, rigidly shaped dimensions; driving down I-74 the sky
    sometimes drapes around, radiant blue on all sides.</p><p>
    
    In other words, it gets old fast.</p><p>
    
    Early Day Miners show a talent on their third full-length, <i>Jefferson at Rest</i>, for tapping into that
    corn-belt uniformity some call tranquil and others call bland.  With arrangements confused about where
    sparse ends and dull begins, most of these seven songs tread water like they're taking a summer camp swim
    test.  Sounding worshipful, at times, of milk-carton kid Mark Kozelek and the stormin' Mormons of Low,
    Early Day Miners rarely exhibit the nuanced dynamics that allow their idols to produce more than mere
    sedative sonics.</p><p>
    
    After the promising, rich-toned opener ""Wheeling"", <i>Jefferson</i> sinks into a mellower mood, as the
    Miners try their hand at spinning sepia-toned country portraits.  Unfortunately, they can't help but sound
    like a second-wave emo band trying to go pastoral, American Football-style twin guitar weaving beneath
    grocery list lyrics of cookie-cutter antique imagery: factory work lights, homesteads, transistor radios,
    quarry swimming pools.  Left to fend for themselves with little creative context, such words lend the songs
    all the down-home authenticity of a Cracker Barrel.</p><p>
    
    In the throat of a stronger vocalist, this effect may have been tempered, but band maestro Dan Burton's
    voice has about as much scenic variation as his home state.  The band whips up a fair amount of texture on
    some tunes-- ""McCalla"" is borderline creepy and taut like ""King of Pain""-era Police; the title track is
    filled out with evening-drone keyboards-- but even these starve to death in dire need of a crescendo or
    two.  By the time the album closes out with a limp on ""Cotillion"", Early Day Miners sound like they're
    running out of batteries.</p><p>
    
    Indiana fancies itself the Crossroads of America, presumably because of its central location both
    geographically and, er, culturally, but I've always personally interpreted the slogan to mean it's the
    kind of state you only pass through on the way to somewhere else.  <i>Jefferson at Rest</i> projects the
    same sense of disposability, and while Secretly Canadian, with a solid stable of Great Plains poets like
    Jason Molina and June Panic, is doing a bang-up job of providing regional mystique for us Midwesterners
    jealous of that cred-loaded South, this release doesn't help the good cause much.  Like Indiana itself,
    <i>Jefferson at Rest</i> might be comforting to a few, but it'll be flyover country to many more.</p></div>"|2656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2656-jefferson-at-rest/|4.7|Rob Mitchum

    flipped through cable,"" it's almost impossible not to immediately demand some kind of cultural perspective--
    anything to justify that kind of deliberately queasy setting.   Mostly, this means fronting an appropriately
    coarse locale.  Check the millions of unmitigated references to Iron &amp; Wine's hometown of Miami, Florida,
    and the inevitable beard-stroking that accompanies attempts to nail Sam Beam's throaty, broken-down folk to
    a town better known for topless sunbathing and people in frayed jean shorts and/or rollerblades.  Somehow,
    authenticity is all tied up in claiming the proper context-- a kind of geo-cultural aptitude, wherein the
    sound and feel of a record is inextricably linked to the nuances of the landscape.  How palatable would The
    Strokes' cigarettes and shitty jeans be if the band had burst forth from the streets of Vermont?  Might we
    have suspected their art-rock credibility?</p><p>
    
    Kathleen Edwards is Canadian, and sleepily coos sad songs about jobs down south, slurping whiskey, infidelity,
    and dirty girls in dirty bars. Her album also hosts a track called ""Hockey Skates""; like Neil Young or The Band,
    Edwards seems firmly rooted in a very specific kind of guilty, gritty American longing, despite hailing from a tidy, peaceable country with unarmed policemen and free
    health care.  It's an anachronism that can only be effectively squared by complete geographic disregard: close your eyes and think
    of Mississippi. Or learn to reconcile yourself to the high, lonesome sound of muddy Canuck melancholy.</p><p>
    
    Because despite this conflicy, <i>Failer</i> is an accomplished debut, packed with haunting, tired laments that only occasionally cross the line to preciousness.
    A few too many goofy guitar solos break things, and some over-produced, swelling strings seem out of place, but Edwards' breathy, wearied singing is
    certainly true and consistently compelling.  Opener ""Six O'Clock News"" is deceptively swishy for a song that recounts the brutal murder of a man whose baby is slated
    to arrive, via the narrator, this June; the sodden and languished ""Sweet Little Duck"" is a brooding, minimalist acoustic
    crawl through depression (""I sleep through most days/ So the time goes by/ And I think I drink now more than ever."")  ""Maria"" is
    steeped in (carefully monitored) guitar feedback and hooky vocals, with lyrics that boast more cars and drugs and fast, fleeing women. </p><p>
    
    Edwards is perpetually being pinned to her Lucinda Williams poster, and the comparison-- the borderline irrelevance of which, I'd
    imagine, must be properly irritating to Edwards-- is actually apt, if a bit too easy to be fulfilling.  She's mastered Williams'
    dusty, slept-all-day whisper, but there's a bit of Aimee Mann's crafty songwriting here, too, and <i>Failer</i> certainly evokes, if only
    incidentally, the atmospherics of Nina Nastasia's striking debut.  This is impeccably put together (if painfully straightforward) alt-
    country, the kind of stuff that wins Grammys and sits on the coffee tables of well-behaved urbanites, who will shiver a bit when
    Edwards says ""fuck,"" but quickly grin and giggle at her candor, clinking their martini glasses.  Regardless of the audience she's
    bound to attract, Edwards has significant songwriting prowess, and <i>Failer</i> stands up to any unfashionable associations.  </p></div>"|2684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2684-failer/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

    Here's Julie Doiron's rare and unreleased solo work from the Eric's Trip years.</p><p>
    
    Huh.</p><p>
    
    Dear Julie Doiron fanatics: in Julie Doiron's newly reissued 1996 debut <i>Broken Girl</i>, which combines
    her first-ever solo tracks from seven-inches and limited edition releases, you shall uncover a trove of
    early 90s, mostly acoustic, lo-fi dream-pop in the vein of Eric's Trip, but far sweeter, and far smooshier.</p><p>
    
    Dear the rest of you: you will uncover a cache of lilting songs which resonate in their earnestness, but not
    much else, since you've heard approximately 3,298 musicians toting similar aesthetics to fanzine conventions
    across America since 1995-- starting and ending with The Softies. A germinate of Doiron's now-honeyed, loping
    alto is apparent on certain tracks, such as ""So Low"", but for the most part she was dotting her I's with
    little hearts and breathily overemphasizing the vowels, as every pop band was wont to do between 1993 and
    1995. Hey, Twee Kitten, you're living all over me.</p><p>
<i>Broken Girl</i> is an odd release.  Stylistically, it doesn't exactly stand the test of time: the material is nice enough, but it's lacking in profundity, or really anything beyond nicety.
    On ""Sorry Story"", Julie Doiron sings about unrequited love; on ""Five"" Julie Doiron plugs in the guitar and sings about being double-timed; on ""August 10"", Julie Doiron sings about
    messing up her relationship and apologizing about it. Julie, we are totally feeling you.</p><p>
    
    For a woman whose latter-day catalogue is so much richer, prettier, and more intimate-- especially her excellent 1999 release with the Wooden Stars, <i>Will You Still Love Me</i>,
    which burned with an urgency still unseen in her other releases-- <i>Broken Girl</i> just seems like pangs of unwarranted nostalgia. Sure, you could say she had a hand in
    defining said acoustic twee-pop sound-- which she did, at least as much as the K Records battalion-- but only if the twee-pop sound had actually been broad-scoped and impacting
    enough to still matter all that much. It's sort of fun to listen to <i>Broken Girl</i> and be all, ""Wow, back then hardly anyone had the internet or ProTools and I spent all my money
    mail-ordering from Cher Doll Records"" or some shit, but unless you're a completist, get <i>Will You Still Love Me</i> instead.  Julie Doiron fanatics, go to town.  The rest of you,
    as you were.</p></div>"|2407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2407-broken-girl/|5.0|Julianne Shepherd

    tape on the back) and made my way to the latest most-hyped club my town had to offer: Club Zongamin.  My
    friends Tigersushi and BB Couk had tipped me off, saying that the place was giving the world something to
    dance to unlike anything heard since Arthur Russell's notorious Dinosaur L creations in the early 80s--
    back when disco and dance were becoming the new punk.</p><p>
    The wait to get in was long; I had nothing better to do than listen to the odd sounds emanating from the
    open doors.  Some girl wearing pink Saran wrap and a belt-buckle with Elvis Presley's face on it mentioned
    how much she liked the track that was currently playing, ""Make Love Not War"".  She was in the process of
    telling me how she appreciated it a lot more than the original Arrows version, when the music abruptly
    halted, cutting short the Dick Dale-influenced guitar and Morricone-styled choral arrangements.  Suddenly,
    the DJ switched to a more direct dance beat led by a fuzzy bass and hi-hat.  The guy behind me sporting a
    faux-hawk and twinkle in his eye was attempting to make time with the girl to my left, who was hardly
    impressed by his knowledge of the track-- ""Serious Trouble""-- and how he had the original ""twelve"" long
    before 2 Many DJs dropped it on their <i>As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2</i> mix a year earlier.</p><p>
    Finally inside the club, I boogied my way to the middle of the dancefloor just as the club owner, Susumu
    Mukai, halted the melee momentarily to allow house turntablist J33\xBD to set up his deck.  Mukai announced
    the arrival of ""Street Surgery 2"" with the atonal manipulation of his fabricated bass, which slowly evolved
    into an awkward-yet-interesting, Indian-inspired backwards phrase before juxtaposing with a lower register
    polka-dance bassline.  All of this inevitably fell upon the cutting room floor, as J33\xBD interjected breaks
    between notes of the main melody for the remainder of the song.</p><p>
    Other tracks held my attention throughout the course of the night-- the swirling ecstasy-fueled atmosphere
    of ""Spiral"", the Esquivel-esque bachelor-pad-music of ""J. Shivers Theme"" (complete with whistling), and the
    alternately funky/frightening ""Tunnel Music""-- but in time the scene ended, and I made my way back to my
    apartment, exhausted and badly in need of a shower.</p><p>
    When I awoke the next morning, groggy (and, yes, smelly), I had the acute sensation of buyer's remorse.
    Suddenly, with the perspective of a new day, I remembered moments from the previous night's mix that had
    mercifully been ignored at the time.  The weak industrial experimentation of ""Double Dostiev"" was a slap
    in the face to every kid that had been at the club sporting their Throbbing Gristle t-shirt, and the
    grossly suspenseful ""Mummies"", with its repeating four notes and distant horror-show ""thuds"", led to
    nothing more than the abrupt flood of the house lights signaling everyone to leave-- a severe disappointment
    in what was otherwise a potentially strong track.  The remainder of the experience was inexplicably tinged
    with the dark odor of commercial viability.  Tracks such as ""Whiplash"" and ""Trespasser"" would sound better,
    perhaps, were it not for the distinct future-sound of Nissans and Hondas whisking across isolated mountain
    roads, fields of fog, and humorous common life situations.</p><p>
    Despite these misgivings, though, I wouldn't ask for a refund on the experience.  The club showed a lot of
    potential that evening, and though it's a fair criticism to say the music functioned more as a collection of
    singles than as a cohesive mix, there's still some merit there.  The next time I get that certain urge to
    strut, I'll make my way back to those pyramid-shaped black-and-white doors and slip into the groove,
    because, while it's doubtful I'll want to visit every night, it would be blatantly dishonest to say I'd
    never return to <i>Zongamin</i>.</p></div>"|8933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8933-zongamin/|7.3|Andrew Bryant

    he's got at least one thing going for him: a sense of determination so
    stubborn, it puts the ""pathetic"" in ""apathetic"".  After my esteemed
    colleague Mark Richardson essentially wrote the man's career epitaph over
    the course of reviewing his first two solo outings, the former king of the
    Royal Trux monarchy shows that he can not only stick to a record-a-year
    release schedule, but that he also doesn't give much of a fuck about what
    anybody thinks of his inability to deliver a cohesive statement.</p><p>
<em>Physical Graffiti</em> fans take note: like <em>Neil Michael Hagerty</em>
    and <em>Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll</em>, Hagerty's latest disc is all
    over the stylistic map, even upping the ante by sprawling out to the length
    of a double-LP.  But where those previous records couldn't really offer much
    in the way of a good song, <em>The Howling Hex</em> is surprisingly chock-full
    of 'em.  And believe it or not, this record succeeds where its predecessors
    failed so miserably: actually drawing the listener in with nearly an entire
    side's worth of straightforward, well-written tunes before veering off into
    the usual inconsistency.</p><p>
    
    ""Firebase Ripcord"", the first of several blue-eyed boogie numbers recorded
    in Chicago with a full band and minimal overdubs, finds Hagerty in a Phil
    Lynott state of mind as he offers a gravelly confession of nothing in
    particular.  From there it's off to what could be an awfully contagious
    outtake from <em>Accelerator</em> (""Out of Reach""), a sloppy soul tune that's
    also about nothing in particular (""Watching the Sands""), and a fragile
    acoustic folk ballad (""Gray"")-- all of which are equal parts concise and
    engaging.</p><p>
    
    The end of the equivalent to LP side one is the disc's turning point, where
    people are either going to succumb to its schizophrenia or depart without a
    backward glance.  ""Rockslide"" is one of two (well, three if you count the
    studio-enhanced ""Energy Plan"") live recordings from some March 2002 shows
    that showcase Hagerty's mercurial guitar freakout mode, aided by Tim Barnes'
    tribal propulsion and Dan Brown's liquid bass.  These drastic rearrangements
    of songs from the previous solo records are far beyond the semi-organized
    chaos that reigns elsewhere on this one, basically coming back to what we've
    been saying all along-- if you enjoy the sound of Hagerty finding his inner
    Joe Walsh (James Gang-era, that is), there's a lot to love; if not, well, you
    know where the skip button is.</p><p>
    
    Shifts in polarity aside, the first half of <i>The Howling Hex is still
    quite outstanding-- with or without the lazy tape composition piece ""Clermont
    Heights""-- begging the question of whether this might've been best left at a
    single LP's length.  Because once side three hits, it's straight downhill with
    few exceptions: other than a shitkicking preamble to the closing ""Energy Plan""
    (""AEP1"") and a couple of similarly minded acoustic tunes, there's really not
    much worth going back to.</i></p><p>
    
    As active as he's been since the Royal Trux ""hiatus"" or ""breakup"" or
    whatever-- three solo records in addition to the Weird War and Drag City
    Supersession projects-- it's starting to look as if Hagerty's a bit lost
    without Jennifer Herrema's yin/yang of intolerability and tragic brilliance.
    But as long as his former partner remains MIA, it seems we have to take what
    we can get, along with all the lapses into mediocrity that entails.</p></div>"|3703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3703-the-howling-hex/|6.6|Scott Hreha

    musical genres that challenge, if not completely subvert, all acceptable notions of aural pleasure.  Even
    bluegrass was one back in the day, and though the lifestyle surrounding it isn't as instantly seditious as
    mohawk-and-safety-pin-circa-'77, the music itself is just as belligerent-- particularly when it's taken out
    of its historically benign porch-and-moonshine context.  Fiercely cacophonous, often percussionless, and
    defiantly lurching toward a flurried, volatile climax, proper bluegrass is hardly the most palatable stuff.
    Sam Bush may be more badass than he gets credit for.</p><p>
    
    Think of the overall sporting, wheat-chewing jugbands of 1910s and 20s, who acted with a certain degree of
    self-awareness, amping up the hillbilly wackiness with novelty songs about donkeys and/or whiskey.  Before
    Bill Monroe came along, shit was all gimmick and goof; in the 1940s, Monroe put on a suit and sped it up,
    pushing the vocals higher and higher and parsing in jazz solos and bouts of improvisation. For better or
    worse, things kept evolving, and now, over fifty years later, hundreds of ""newgrass"" bands have dragged the
    genre (at present, significantly, painfully watered down) onto woodsy college campuses, lighting up big,
    fat joints all across America.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, Charlottesville, Virginia's Hackensaw Boys have defiantly eschewed the lazy, neo-hippy circuit
    in favor of staying freakishly traditional and, incidentally, also opening for bands like Modest Mouse (or
    joining 2002's Unlimited Sunshine tour, alongside The Flaming Lips and Cake, after John McCrea specifically
    extended an invite). These are startlingly indie twists for a band with eight members (four of whom play
    banjo; one of whom is named Pee Paw, another Skeeter, and another The Kooky-Eyed Fox), no drummer, and a
    penchant for fiddles.  But the Hacks have always been a curious outfit.</p><p>
    
    With origins that effectively pre-date the <i>Smithsonian Anthology of American Folk</i> revolution spawned
    by 2000's aptly titled <i>O Brother</i> soundtrack, The Hackensaw Boys are surprisingly well-steeped in the
    picked, howled traditions of the American south, and their second self-released record, <i>Keep It Simple</i>,
    is packed with vigorous, pitchy bursts.  <i>Keep It Simple</i> doesn't perfectly reflect the band's fast-and-fierce
    live show, but it offers a solid glimpse of their proclivity for catchy melodies, classic harmonizing, and
    stringy noodling. Somehow, the band infuses their grassy tornado with brazen punk attitude and catchy pop
    structure, while simultaneously remaining vehemently sincere; tracks like ""Dance Around"" feature prototypically
    bluegrassian lyrics (""Dancin' with the girls/ That's a mighty fine thing/ You ain't gotta buy no wedding ring"")
    without mocking the traditions from which they came.</p><p>
    
    If you're of the jaded sort, this kind of anti-irony can be a little jarring. The first time I heard The
    Hackensaw Boys strum up their flurried mess of scrappy, eight-man bluegrass, I was just off a plane from New
    York City, tired and twitchy, curled fetal into the grubby, wooden floorboards of Charlottesville's Starr
    Hill Music Hall, pitifully slurping a cold pale ale. Eventually, The Hackensaw Boys puttered onstage,
    smirking and vaguely feral, crowding three tall microphones and forming a tight, acoustic cluster of
    reeling fiddles, banjos, guitars, harmonica, accordion, washboard, upright bass, charismo, dobro, and
    mandolin.  My own cranky posturing aside, I dug the display: a noisy army of quick strings and wide, clever
    eyes spinning their own (slightly bizarre) brand of thick mountain music, with manic, nasal vocals and rowdy
    instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    The Hackensaw Boys are all fairly young, and the sounds they make-- wild, boisterous, merry-- are so
    unexpectedly raw, so intensely traditional and sincere, that it inevitably takes a few minutes to acclimate.
    By the time I'd stopped staring blankly, I realized I was fully and completely interested.  These boys were
    singing things like, ""Oh my goodness/ Oh my God/ Oh my Ruby Pearl!"" and not giving a shit about whether

    It turns out that most people in Charlottesville can offer up their own version of a Hackensaw story, and
    it almost invariably includes a handful of extraneous, contextual details: a grassy field, a purple mountain,
    eight kegs of beer, a 1964 GMC touring coach, the Blue Moon Diner and a hot platter of buttery flapjacks.
    There's something intensely anachronistic about The Hackensaw Boys that, even within the over-examined
    paradigm of American roots music, seems to force people to acknowledge their surroundings and carefully
    consider the contrast.  And that kind of examination is rarely a bad thing.</p></div>"|3699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3699-keep-it-simple/|7.7|Amanda Petrusich

    the fun lies in the way you hide its taste, and I would argue that a ""faithful remix"" (or a salty cake) defeats the point.  So, chefs, DJs and other
    people who like to make messes have run amok over the past couple of decades turning what might have been nothing more than small,
    lifeless pea into Haydn's <i>Creation</i>.  Many times, this transformation is done for practical reasons-- say, extending a groove for the dancefloor,
    or adding a little punch for the radio-- though I've always been more interested in the mixture made for reasons purely ""artistic,"" culinary or otherwise.</p><p>
    
    Over time, this recreation-- probably a notch removed from a ""remix,"" if only because the most interesting stuff involves more than just editing and
    jacking with levels-- has evolved from fringe experiment to full-grown musical cuisine.  Early musique concrete pioneers Pierre Schaeffer and
    Pierre Henry might have envisioned a world where everyday sound or radio broadcasts might be turned into avant-garde art via sampling and electronic
    amplification, but I doubt they could have foreseen the po-mo hurricane that is modern sound design: Otomo Yoshihide uses his ""group"" Ground Zero to ""remix""
    UK experimentalists Cassiber's live record; Christian Marclay cuts up Elliot Sharp's guitar in real time and nobody comes out unscathed; John Oswald
    forges massive documents of alien sound out of music already heard by anyone with ears; Ekkehard Ehlers, Fennesz and Keith Whitman play their own stuff,
    cycle it through a laptop, and produce sounds at once familiar and of singular idiosyncrasy.  Nothing is sacred.  Or, music is god, and cannibals
    make the best sacrifices.</p><p>
    
    Merzbow's 2002 release <i>Amlux</i> is the main course for better than twenty very hungry young dicers on <i>Ikebana</i>'s meta-menu.  According to the liners,
    artists were supposed to use the original album's music as an element in a new composition, rather than piece together a traditional remix.
    Furthermore, despite Masami Akita's rep as devastating noise dominatrix, none of the new tunes were to be necessarily bound to his extreme aesthetic.
      I can imagine the participants feeling either fantastic glee at the prospect of being given free rein in the Merzbow shop, or a bit of paranoia
    at approaching the same material as twenty other artists and having to come up with something just as interesting.</p><p>
    
    The coolest thing about <i>Ikebana</i> is that you don't even really need to know anything about Merzbow or ""noise"" to listen to it.  There are a few u
    nruly moments that seem pages out of some forgotten cassette-only Masami Akita (Merzbow) release, but in general, much of this release could pass
    for an experimental IDM sampler.  Alec Empire's raging ""Digital Hardcore Mix"" comes on like the soundtrack to a <i>Terminator</i> sequel that didn't suck,
    with wildly distorted drum tracks kicking the shit out of all the extraneous debris (hint: tonality = debris) in their way.  With a decent stereo, the bassline could
    do some serious damage.  Similarly, Luke Vibert's (performing under his Plug alias) excellent untitled futuro drum-n-bass slaps an engorged, fuzzy repeating
    synth bass under jagged glitch stutter beat.  Some of the tempo changes and oddly timed samples remind me of the more spastic moments on Hrvatski's
    first record-- or possibly of the record I wish Squarepusher would make.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, artists you might think would provide the electro-splice goods deliver something else entirely.  Mouse on Mars' ""Superstar"" features no
    beats whatsoever, and in truth, sounds almost exactly like a Merzbow original, albeit a piece wherein he doesn't so much opt for deafening
    displays of violent florescence as disorientating sound design.  Cornelius' untitled piece starts out innocently enough, with sampled jungle birds and
    rain, but gradually mutates into the pitter-patter of static electricity and industrial clang.  Nobukazu Takemura's ""Assembler Mix"" takes the static idea
    and gallops with it, giving you hundreds of variations on the same grating implosion for what seems an eternity.  Now that's entertainment!  However,
    it's also pretty reverential, and in scheme of Ikebana seems kind of quaint. For reference, see Makoto Kawabata's amazing/nauseating ""Revolved Jane"", which
    shows you don't have to bother living up to a legacy if you're perfectly capable of vandalizing it with a chorus of grotesque psych-locusts.</p><p>
<i>Ikebana</i> isn't exactly the smoothest listen, and not just because it comes from Merzbow music.  DJ Spooky's trip-hop treatment doesn't really sound
    like it belongs on the same album as the MoM or Takemura tracks, and Negativland's highly annoying ""An Actual Attack"" doesn't sound like
    anything I need in my collection at all.  Still, as samplers go, it's consistently ""challenging""-- or better yet, there lots of sounds you'll want
    to come back to after being assaulted the first time.  And you want to know a secret?  I never heard the original <i>Amlux</i> music, and can vouch for this
    stuff working well enough on its own.  So, sit down, fork in place, and dig in-- you like buffet, right?</p></div>"|5246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5246-ikebana-merzbows-amlux-rebuilt-reused-and-recycled/|7.8|Dominique Leone

Then ""art-punk"" gets the call-up for tomorrow's headlines, and <em>Exitheuxa</em> breaks GoGoGo Airheart so     instantly and to such immense proportions you'd think they were from New York (and you'd <em>almost</em> be     right).  Meanwhile, all the band's loyal first-generation fans have to say to the flavor-of-the-month     fashionistas is, ""What took you so long?"" because they already <em>knew</em> what the rest of the world is     just figuring out now.  To some bands, this ""dance"" thing is a ""movement""; to GoGoGo Airheart, it's just     one of many genres that could be foisting them into the rock 'n' roll spotlight.  It's a flavor like any     other-- post-punk, electro, they even got some pop chops.</p><p>Wait... did somebody say ""reissues""?  Sure enough, Los Angeles' groundbreaking Gold Standard Laboratories     label has answered the call, effectively offering a second chance to anyone who missed the band's 1997     self-titled debut or 1998 follow-up, <em>Love My Life, Hate My Friends</em>, during their brief run on Vinyl     Communications. It's a move that bespeaks great conviction on the part of GSL to back this band-- and     fortunately, it's warranted.  Even though Airheart's debut feels a bit raw in comparison to their subsequent     accomplishments, <em>Love My Life</em> still stands as their best work to date.  More importantly, though, the     scope of these two albums shows just how much ground the band can be expected to cover in the future: the San     Diego boys covered a sick amount of ground on these two records, careening recklessly, but determinedly,     through genres and styles.</p><p>The hazy minimalism of their debut is light-years removed from the nervous grooves of last year's widely     championed <em>Exitheuxa</em>, in spite of the fact that both ""November, November"" and ""Something Else""     found a place on both discs.  But, due in part to the extraterrestrial engineering of ""noise terrorist""     Spacewurm, GoGoGo Airheart play up an icy, electronic emptiness broken intermittently by low-frequency     transmissions from outside the solar system.  Some of the intercepted signals are revelatory, like the     ominous red alert threat of ""Community, Continuity, <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">Insecurity</span>"" or the smiling synthstrumental,     ""Distance"", hinting at things to come; others, like the shambling tangle of assorted percussion on ""Elgin     Marbles"", should have been jammed outright.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the static hiss and vibe of ""Untitled"", ""Positions Are Not Popular"", and especially the     near-nonexistent ""Chemistry in the U.S.A."" serve no Earthly purpose apart from interference-- at best,     they marginally enhance the album's cohesion by contributing to its wholesale disjointedness.  From an     album standpoint, GSL's decision to remove four cuts from the original tracklist (they inexplicably kept     the terrible filth of ""Holiday"") makes it a marked improvement on the Vinyl Communications edition, but     even so-- and despite its occasional inspiring peaks-- the only thing holding <em>GoGoGo Airheart</em> together is nerve, and even that doesn't always do the trick.</p>
<p>In retrospect, <em>GoGoGo Airheart</em> seems just a test; by <em>Love My Life</em>, they're a tight-knit,     fully operational unit with a feel for their boundaries and actual vision.  The brutal swagger of ""No     Language Before Its Time"" fades in from the distance, setting the prevailing tone early on: one of vague,     indiscernible malice.  The shallow rush of the snares and pulsing bass collide with shrieking-yet-restrained     guitar lines, leaving behind nothing but jittery paranoia.  And as it turns out, that's the mood that     dominates the proceedings here-- but just to show they've got other tricks up their sleeve, Airheart     transition directly into breezy alt-country, care of ""First Among Equals"".  It's a little abrupt, certainly,     but this isn't the reticent toe-dipping of their debut; they're ready to shit their pants, dive in, and     swim.  Every disparate musical aspect is tackled full-force and expertly assimilated.  Again, it's not all     perfect, but the resultant sweep and urgency of <em>Love My Life</em> is humbling and, at times, fearsome.</p>
<p>For every sinister assault on <em>Love My Life, Hate My Friends</em>-- from the clear inspiration ""Congratulations""     gleans from Peter Hook's Joy Division bass, to ""SP3""'s scrambled synthetics-- there's always a release from     the tension.  Songs like ""Rebirth"" and ""How I Feel Tired"" are necessary respites, if only to momentarily     alleviate the pressure, and consequently stand out as among the album's strongest offerings.  It's the final     catharsis, though, that's also the finest: for all of the nail-biting build-up on the rest of <em>Love My     Life</em>, ""Ever Since I Was Young"" is the gloriously anticlimactic denouement.  The desperate pace finally     gives way to a somber, aching farewell, instantly recalling the bittersweet closure of Radiohead's ""Life in     a Glasshouse"".  Beyond the overt similarity of tone, the total emotional drain produced by the preceding     tracks leaves the listener hollowed-out, and both of these songs seize on the only thing that's left:     resignation.</p>
<p>On this final note, with so much already behind them, all that's left is where they're going.  Neither GoGoGo     Airheart's self-titled debut or <em>Love My Life, Hate My Friends</em> is quite as simultaneously balanced and     diverse as <em>Exitheuxa</em>, but they don't duplicate it much, either.  Rather, these records demonstrate     the true depth of the band, expanding even further on what they're capable of, to the point that nearly     anything seems possible.</p>

Like many of
    their songs, it's an attention-deficient, disjointed, yelpy plate of noise with guitars popping out all
    around like switchblades, erections, or eyeballs.  Both title and song illustrate the NYC quartet's
    insatiable hunger for straight-up, gunky rock 'n' roll sex appeal, tempered by straight-up, gunky academic
    interchange.  It's not a mild pairing, but Ex Models are panting for the bombast, hold the fancy mannerisms,
    thanks.  This spastic steez goes for the throat of French post-structuralist theory, then tries to stick
    in a wayward tongue.  Really.  What else did you think ""Ex Models"" meant?</p><p>
    
    Since <i>Other Mathematics</i>, their 2001 Ace Fu debut, the band has not only dumped a bassist (Mike
    Masiello was replaced by The Seconds' Zach Lehrhoff) but mostly left their art-funk sound behind, too,
    allowing their new record to shiver and sweat in its own ragged chunks of jittery riffs and self-mocking,
    flesh-searing staccato vocals.  Too clever to be speared with the ""no wave"" dart, but too abrasive and
    irreverent to land under any other umbrella, <i>Zoo Psychology</i> is something like a highly developed
    version of what's currently happening in the Midwest noize scene, plus the ghost of Oingo Boingo.  It
    swims in complex musical ideas, which are in turn presented skeletally enough that, for the most part,
    you can even actually figure out what the fuck is going on.</p><p>
    
    That is, assuming you have the ability to stop time.  A full fifteen songs play out in a mere thirty minutes,
    and <i>Zoo Psychology</i>'s refrains are faster, shorter, and more efficient than ever.  Edge-of-yr-seat
    time signatures spark into dizzying guitar bombs, occasionally giving way to a few short, grating jams and
    highly tense, 30-second drum bashings.  Ex Models' world is always on the verge of stepping on a mine--
    even their girlish vocal mannerisms (e.g. the fanciful cooing falsettos of Lehrhoff and guitarist/singer
    Shahin Motia) can't tempt this apocalypse party into a midnight cocktail.  On ""Zoo Love"", the boys sass in
    unison like they think they're junior high cheerleaders/50s R&amp;B; singers doing time in the National Guard
    as the instruments grind out a simple but bratty little strut.  I have no idea what the lyrics are, because
    they're sung with appropriately sloppy, mushy mouths and: THERE IS NO ACCOMPANYING LYRIC SHEET!, though I
    <i>could</i> make out the phrases ""funky and twist"" and ""noise if it gets too loud,"" which both seem to be
    the illustrative fragments of the band's musical thesis, however subconscious.</p><p>
    
    Did you ever see Bela Tarr's brilliant film <i>The Werckmeister Harmonies</i>, which was (generally) about
    the peace and clarity possible after the total destruction of everything?  Yeah, well, this is sorta like
    that.  Ex Models are only happy after all pretense of calm has been shattered, bashed, kicked in, crumbled,
    and twisted 'round their heads like a helicopter.  They sound like they're vandalizing something, or about
    to, or just building up the courage to go balls-to-the-wall loco.  That this band can be utterly in sync
    and on the pants-peeing edge at once, plus presenting entire philosophical and mathematical principles
    under the guise of sexually charged, aggressive post-punk, while still having enough humor to title their
    problems ""Hey Boner"" and ""Brand New Panties"" is the answer to a question only Guy Debord could present.

    becoming a juvenile hipster-prodigy.  See, every ""cool"" person I ever knew during my formative years was
    partially subsidized by their siblings: the younger sibling strove toward trendiness to act as a role model
    to the following generation, while the older sibling had the less proactive role of wisely plundering the
    influences behind the younger kids' record collections and recommending similar-- and often better-- bands.</p><p>
    
    Being an only child, though, I had to wait until I was well into my teens to start uncovering music that got
    my motor purring, and even then it felt like an arduously slow and expensive habit to maintain.  Added to
    this late-to-the-game-shame was the deplorable fact that most of the bands I discovered for myself had
    broken up by the time I got around to hearing them, shattering my hopes of ever experiencing the full
    spectrum of their music in a live setting.  Yep, it's too late for me, but us Pitchforkers would like to
    think we're preventing this from happening to other kids out there.</p><p>
    
    So let me just say that <i>Wetheads Come Running</i> is momentous.  Absorbing a large index of musical
    inspirations, Austin, Texas-based newcomers Single Frame blaze through 20 songs in a scant 37 minutes,
    their countless influences congealing and materializing as short, clipped pop songs that stick around
    only as long as their hooks can remain fresh.  This thing is packed with potential summer college radio
    hits-- ""Comm. Jet (Creepykid Remix)"" is chief among them, with its pronounced and cooing vocals blending
    Modest Mouse-style vocal timing with a bargain-basement synth and a fistpumping, anthemic chorus replete
    with nonsense lyrics so passionate they nearly convince you they mean something.</p><p>
    
    ""Eavesdropper Goes Solo"" slows down the tempo for a quiet march that, augmented by clacky, reverbed
    percussion, continually builds to fake-out climaxes before dropping back down to its impossibly catchy
    chorus, relating to the angst-ridden introvert with such lines as, ""The fact of the matter is/ I'm
    always behind/ The fact is/ I'm always out of place/ In my own skin/ With my own friends.""  Though certainly
    not as poignant as Sly &amp; The Family Stone's ""Skin I'm In"", Single Frame make their point just as sincerely,
    and with a melody no less vital.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, ""Mod Style '68""-- quite probably doomed to be known as ""the Fugazi song""-- has the group saluting
    D.C. with a joyous, geek-hardcore riot over a loping beat with harsh and rapid vocal delivery.  Above the
    sing-song chorus, two voices call-and-respond in what sounds like a guest spot from Ian and Guy themselves,
    before the near-bubblegum refrain is roped in by the harder edge of the guitars and synthesizers.</p><p>
    
    Other tracks borrow heavily from the aftermath of the Electronic Poem, resulting in a large amount of
    found sound constituents, established mainly in interludes such as ""Rare Paintings"", ""In the Ground"" (which
    electronically modulates a female voice to an operatic effect), and to some extent on ""Post Daydream
    Forecast Endeavor"", one of <i>Wetheads</i>' clear standouts.  One of the album's only tracks to build
    brief interludes into the song itself, ""Post Daydream Forecast Endeavor"" works primarily because the band
    has a good sense of balance: the accompaniment co-opts elements of the post-punk tradition and incorporates
    strongly syncopated swing-percussion that's cut only intermittently by a keyboard drone and a buzzsaw guitar--
    and it's all an elaborate accent for a hook so perfectly simple you might wonder how it's escaped 50 years
    of pop songs without having ever been used.</p><p>
    
    Better still: on top of all this early achievement, Single Frame possess that one characteristic so rare
    amongst the all-too-common indie sophomore slumps: even greater potential.  That the trio is already this
    attuned to one another's musical instincts is pretty impressive, but the slightly undercooked sound of a
    couple of these tracks (""I've Been to a Party at This House"", ""3 Bloodless Shadows"") give the impression
    that, with another year or two under their belts, they could easily develop into one of indie music's
    frontrunners.</p><p>
    
    With this in mind, it's imperative that this band's music be brought to anyone and everyone that has an ear
    for it-- which is why I wholeheartedly suggest that, during your next beer-and-cigarette trip to the local
    secondary school (pervert), you bring a copy of <i>Wetheads</i> not just for your kinsfolk, but for the
    chubby antisocial kid, too.  Maybe that person won't need something like Cobain's drugged rants about
    Flipper, The Raincoats, and The Vaselines ten years after the fact to develop his or her own musical
    aesthete.</p></div>"|7180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7180-wetheads-come-running/|8.5|Andrew Bryant

    to frantically establish a massive, webby paradigm of music past, present, and future, and then to neatly (and accurately) place each 
    CD sitting in his/her respective stack within that ridiculous, elaborate map.  Here's the thing: most of the time, the Lilys 
    sound an awful lot like the late-60s, mod-rocking Kinks.  Frontman Kurt Heasley has channeled Ray Davies so expertly that it's impossible 
    not to half-expect the guy to bust out ""Lola"" every time a new track opens.  Heasley sings with a distinctly fey Brit clip, 
    despite hailing from less-than-Cockney Philadelphia, and he and 1969-Davies even sport the same suit and haircut. Self-parody? 
    Blind idol worship? Preemptively striking at critics?</p><p>
    
    There are a handful of other folk-pop-psychedelic influences (from the Beatles to My Bloody Valentine to The Apples in Stereo) evident 
    in the Lilys' electro-acoustic buzz, although, ultimately, context proves stoically unimportant.  The Lilys' slot in the ever-growing 
    matrix of recorded music is, happily, very much their own, and <i>Precollection</i>, the band's eighth full-length, is far from being 
    blatantly derivative or embarrassingly footnoted.  For the most part, the Lilys' melodic strumming and driving percussion is 
    addictively palatable and, occasionally, surprisingly innovative.</p><p>
    
    Heasley is the sound-defining double helix of the Lilys, and the peripheral players rotate from album to album, almost 
    incidentally.  <i>Precollection</i> sees Heasley drawing from his own varied discography nearly as extensively as he draws from his 
    record collection, and many of the tracks here reflect and refine past experiments, now imbued with a new sense of coherency and 
    artistic vision.  ""Perception Room"" weds Heasley's early-90s fascination with meandering, shoegazing space rock to his poppier 
    sensibilities, and the result is dark, rhythm-heavy, and shiftily melodic, a song that would have been startlingly comfortable on 
    late-80s college rock radio, alongside cuts by R.E.M. and the Church.</p><p>
    
    ""Meditations on Speed"" is a muscular tangle of acoustic strums and electric fuzz, quiet, occasionally inaudible vocals (Heasley sheds 
    his Davies skin when he hops into higher registers, but the resulting whine can be difficult to discern over this track's throb-throb bass) and 
    merry, driving organ.  Like almost every song on <i>Precollection</i>, ""Meditations"" is held together by an incessant, 
    uncompromising rhythmic assault; there very few holes, gaps, or pauses for breath.  Silence plays a minimal role (at best) and if 
    these songs had been less skillfully assembled, they might seem impenetrably thick.  But Heasley's grown into an expert songsmith, 
    and although not all of <i>Precollection</i>'s ten tracks are wholly distinct, each does offer something unique for your time: an 
    unexpected drumbeat, a lone guitar wail, an oddly timed burst of vocals.</p><p>
<i>Precollection</i>'s title track (and opener) sees Heasley suggesting, convincingly, to ""become what you are."" It's an especially apt 
    new beginning for a musician finally working out his ambitions and channeling them into something both resonant and entirely 
    coherent.  Achieved nearly ten years after the band's inception, this is a bright start for Heasley's Lilys.</p></div>"|4798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4798-precollection/|7.7|Amanda Petrusich

    the capacity of directed sound to inform an otherwise disconnected gustatory sensation.  I searched out other experiences, finding that classical music whets my appetite for 
    small portions of vegetable dishes and rare Japanese cuisine served on an asymmetrical jade plate.  Jazz makes my mouth dry with the odor 
    of cigarettes and a hard drink.  Rock 'n' roll-- and nearly all of its substituents-- leaves an aftertaste of mostly carnal delights; a bleeding porterhouse, or at times a more elegant filet, 
    wrapped in bacon and topped with horseradish sauce.  There are notable exceptions to these corporal delicacies though, as rock 'n' roll has also given birth to the 
    bubblegum-and-marshmallow-flavored emo-core scene, the Spam-laden rock/punk-revival and the saltwater taffy of electro/electro pop.</p><p>
    Counted among its differing offspring of rock is shoegaze, a sub-genre from which nearly any composition lends itself directly to savory desserts-- small portions of dense pleasure that are 
    lovely in moderation, but can be more than slightly off-putting if consumed in mass quantities.  <i>Loveless</i>, the Pitchfork-endorsed exemplar shoegazer album, serves as the crème brule-- 
    the mark by which all others should be measured.  This leads to a problem: the watermark of excellence having been set, the only thing left for its musical legacy is the tweaking 
    of the established order in hopes of arriving at something new, if not necessarily better.  This has led to all manner of ghastly cuisine, but occasionally it yields something palatable.</p><p>
    Initially, the thought of joining shoegaze and heavy metal-- a la Black Sabbath and Judas Priest-- is as off-putting an idea as combining dark chocolate 
    and sweetbread, but the Party of Helicopters nearly prove otherwise on their aptly titled <i>Please Believe It</i>.  Flexing hard riffs over a constant wall of feedback, Jamie Stillman leads his 
    troupe through the album in a manner befitting the former drummer of post-hardcore group Harriet the Spy:  upgrading that group's sound with vocalist Joe Dennis' roots in the shoegazer 
    outfit The Man I Fell in Love With, Party of Helicopters push forward to pull off an amalgamation yielding some memorable tracks.</p><p>
    Sounding like an early-Shudder to Think, ""The Good Punk"" delivers layered falsetto choruses atop a fuzzed-out bass and pummeling percussion.  The song spans a progressive length of over six 
    minutes, providing chromatic runs and time signature switch-ups that serve to highlight the irony of the line, ""this ain't punk rock enough for my ears.""  Further down the Craig Wedren and Nathan 
    Larson ladder, ""The Toucher"" builds on a catchy hook that tightens and releases like a kinetic block-on-a-spring, over a distant hum and trite lyrics regarding a love triangle between a moustache, 
    a little brother, and a loved one.</p><p>
    The heavy string-work of Hum is later apparent, on ""Cover Me"" and ""Science Reasons"", as are the stop/start, dense variations of Polvo, which rise on ""Rising Up Is Hard Work (Let's Just Sit Here)"".  
    PoH wade into the dance-friendly waters of a swinging Dismemberment Plan with ""Delta '88"", and to a lesser extent the frantic bass of <i>No Kill No Beep Beep</i>-era Q and Not U on 
    ""Never Ending Cycle"", which also features acoustic elements buried in the mix, giving the song an enjoyable organic base.  Unfortunately-- despite a handful of soundalike respites-- the music 
    tends towards an equilibrium that doesn't entertain beyond the initial shock of its conjoined parts.</p><p>
    Like most Epicurean experiments, novelty soon fades away to reveal that, from the beginning, the varying musical concepts were tacked onto a weaker-than-anticipated structure.  Like sausage 
    steeped in syrup and served up warm with French toast, <i>Please Believe It</i> sounds like a good idea at first but the thought of having it every day-- or even every week-- makes my stomach 
    quiver.  Another marriage of frayed guitar layering and weighty riffs is marred by its own overwrought fusion, a dish whose varied and potent flavors never resolve, spoiling what could have turned out a 
    fine meal had it been prepared by chefs less eager to impress.</p></div>"|6186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6186-please-believe-it/|6.5|Andrew Bryant

It's not enough that their most popular program featured 
    huge, fluorescent birds and other unidentified animals (what the hell was Cookie Monster?  Oscar the Grouch?  Grover!?), it was created by a man whose 
    greatest claim to fame before the show was a documentary about what it was like traveling through his brain while he meditated.  And what 
    about all those weird songs: that chaotic one with the counting and the chef always falling down the steps that always sounded like they had recorded it 
    too loud and was really distorted, or the one with the psychedelic pinball machine, and that way-out-there funky fusion vocal shit (that I later 
    learned was penned by Herbie Hancock, and sung by the fucking Pointer Sisters).  I suppose the producers at PBS and its affiliate networks like 
    Boston's WGBH were reaching a tad far in those days, but to their credit, it's hard to imagine a world where their colorful, 60s-informed visions of a 
    new education didn't exist.</p><p>
    
    In 1969, jazz vibraphonist Monty Stark was working as a bandleader and arranger for WGBH's <i>Say Brother</i> program when he received a request from one 
    Hoagy Bix Carmichael, son of legendary American songwriter, Hoagy Carmichael (""Star Dust"", ""Georgia On My Mind"").  Bix was keen to produce a children's 
    show wherein his father's music would receive a facelift for a new generation of kids, and in the process, learn the little-uns some music 
    education.  Stark's quartet, Stark Reality, had been working on <i>Say Brother</i>, and though they probably weren't terribly familiar with Carmichael's 
    old-time pop, were pretty keen to give it their own flavor.  So, their own flavor: jazzy funk beats, fuzz guitar, wandering, restless bass and some of 
    the most distorted vibes this side of, well, anywhere.  Stark Reality made proto acid-jazz and psych-funk out of the tunes, and though it was supposed 
    to bring the music closer to something children in 1970 could dig, I can only imagine what they might have thought.  I mean, unless these kids were 
    hip to the Soft Machine and Headhunters, they'd probably have preferred something less out there.</p><p>
    
    Stones Throw's reissue of <i>Now</i> includes all of the Carmichael songs, as well as a few Stark originals, though the less said about most of those, the 
    better.  Stark's band works up a groove pretty well, and he's an interesting player (even when that distorto-vibe gag wears thin after a few tunes), but 
    I could probably have done without hearing him sing for the rest of my life.    Oddly, Stark's raw, Oklahoma monotone croon only seems to veer off key 
    and into the beyond on his original songs, because the covers sound mostly OK-- all in all, a good reason to appreciate the mastery of Hoagy 
    Carmichael's melodies.</p><p>
    
    ""Junkman's Song"" comes on like the mutated pairing of War's ""Cisco Kid"" and ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down"".  The band hammers the beat with patented 
    Hendrix-style guitar chords, but on vibes, and Abercrombie's vintage six-string sear adds just the right amount of haze to what might otherwise 
    lapse into cocktail lounge fuzak.  The sing-song melody sounds a little disorienting over this treble-heavy brew of dirty jazz-rock, but that's 
    probably the most interesting thing about the piece.  In fact, throughout the album I wish Stark Reality had spent more time on the song proper, 
    rather than taking off into cosmic improv jams so often.  ""Thirty Days Hath September"" has another great melody, but you have to wade through a few 
    minutes of grade-A noodling to get to it-- and once Stark gets through, they launch another marathon, meandering solo session.  I'm all for musical 
    exploration, but this kind of flat-footed jamming gets pretty boring after a while.</p><p>
    
    ""Cooking"" gets it right, apparently by loosing the solo sections almost entirely.  The slinky groove, powered by super dissonant vibe harmonies, and 
    vintage wah-wah gives way to Stark's ominous rendition of the original Carmichael melody.  Again, the intro to the tune is about twice as long as 
    the tune itself, but thankfully, the payoff comes relatively shortly, and the groove is worth the wait.  ""All You Need to Make Music"" finds the band 
    teaching the world about flats, naturals and half-rests-- but is actually a pretty good funk tune.  Vinnie Johnson's tight drumming holds together a 
    clever arrangement wherein the band plays off of Stark's lyrics detailing various aspects of musical notation.  Anyway, the important thing is that 
    the rather theoretical nature of the piece steers the band away from their more unhinged tendencies.</p><p>
    
    Stones Throw have dropped a few gems in my lap over the years, but in this case, I wonder if the funk really is its own reward.  The best moments on <i>Now</i> 
    are reminiscent of other artists mentioned above, but the worst are basically unlistenable (I'm serious, play ""Too Much Tenderness"" at your own risk).  
    All the sounds in between are by-the-numbers jazz quartet funk, post-boogaloo, pre- the DJ culture that would mine their beats for loops.  I 
    reckon 75% of this CD occupies that middle ground, so if a few fleeting moments of fuzzy glory sound good to you, have at it.  Hopefully, the kids 
    will be all right.</p></div>"|7700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7700-now/|5.5|Dominique Leone

Some folks can't stand frontman E's sense of humor, which he calls ""edgy"" but is closer to a seven-year-old 
    yelling ""SHIT!"" in a crowd to embarrass his parents.  Not everyone likes his super-polished power pop stylings; in fact us indie folk are usually suspicious of a band as finely 
    calibrated to the needs of cutesy, ""alternative"" pop radio as the Eels.</p><p>
    
    But you have to admit that E's had plenty of hits to make up for the misses.  He has a knack for crossing obscenity and crass comments with heavy subject matter: the ballad 
    ""It's a Motherfucker"", and the best songs on his ""catchy tunes about cancer and death"" album <i>Electro-Shock Blues</i>, combine this off-handed crassness with sincerely 
    moving music, to put just the right spin on his personal fight with despair.  And as for his pop, give him credit for clinging to the top tier of L. A.'s new breed of songwriters, 
    rubbing up against Michael Penn on the soundtrack to <i>The Anniversary Party</i>, hanging out at Largo with Jon Brion, and hey-- maybe it was Aimee Mann who talked him 
    into ditching his <i>Souljacker</i>-era homeless beard.</p><p>
    
    We didn't sharpen the knives when the Eels announced a new record, even if the title deserves a chuckle.  E coined the word ""shootenanny"" to 
    describe a fun shooting spree, but this pathetic title turns out to be ten times more clever than anything else on the album.  Musically and lyrically, E is spent-- out of ideas, out of 
    innovation, unable to cough up anything but by-the-numbers pop in the fourteen originals he wrote for this disc.  The self-loathing and despair that seeps in 
    around the edges touch so lightly that they can't give it a backbone.  I'm not slamming this album to diss the man behind it, but to tell him he can do better.  Much, 
    much better.</p><p>
    
    E works country and blues into <i>Shootenanny!</i>; it opens as a polished, petrified bleat complete with harmonica, and reveals other would-be redneck classics 
    like ""Restraining Order Blues"" and ""Lone Wolf"" as it spins on.  Add to this superficial affectation E's stone-washed voice-- rougher than ever-- and you have 
    the makings of an urban cowboy record, one that's sacrificed the splice-ups, orchestral fragments and family-friendly grooves that made him a rich man's Beck on 
    previous outings.</p><p>
    
    The production as always sounds great, making fifty cent arrangements sound like a million bucks, but that doesn't save the music, which is as generic a set of 
    post-post-Beatles pop as he could possibly turn out-- with some of the least involving melodies of his career, like the blase feel-good of ""Rock Hard Times"".  He offers some 
    passable bubblegum-- the alt-rock anthem ""Saturday Morning""-- but only a few of these songs have anything fresh or engaging to offer.  ""Dirty Girl"" or ""Wrong About Bobby"" 
    muster fast, catchy hooks, and there's some graceful orchestration on ""Numbered Days"", showing E <i>could</i> have made a passable, catchy stop-gap album.  Could have, 
    if it weren't for the lyrics.</p><p>
    
    The author of the rich and witty words of <i>Electro-Shock Blues</i> cranks out rhymes so forced, they're reminiscent of your parents making up lines while they sing 
    along to the radio.  Good choruses are marred by poor verses on ""Love of the Loveless"" and ""Dirty Girl""; his in-studio lyrics are never rewritten. ""I made mistakes/ 
    Everyone does/ Don't know why I did/ I guess just because.""  Was that even worth writing as a placeholder?</p><p>
    
    Then there's his clunky stab at redneck chic.  Johnny Paycheck he ain't: the violent psychodramas hinted at by the lyrics never come to life, and the few dark lines are left 
    so far out on their own that they're inconsequential-- the serial killer threats in ""Rock Hard Times"", and his repetitious boasts that he's a ""lone wolf.""  ""Wrong 
    About Bobby"" is full of purely belligerent shit-talk: there's some guy named Bobby, and there's something about a  girlfriend, and how Bobby'd better not fuck with 
    E or E'll...I played it five times and I still don't know or care what revenge E's mapping out.  ""Somebody Loves You"" wraps things up like a late-night hangover on the men's 
    room floor, so vague and saccharine, grasping exhaustedly for meaning but coming off a maudlin meditation on its own failure.</p><p>
    
    There are  pleas for help on <i>Shootenanny!</i>, but he's recorded better pleas before.  The problem isn't that the record's unlistenable, it's the half-assed, uninspired 
    compositions themselves, scrawled on a Largo's cocktail napkin and run through auto-pilot, buttressed only by ""craftsmanship"" and token self-pity.  The biggest alarm bell 
    goes off on the second-to-last track, ""Fashion Awards"", which he wrote <i>while watching the VH-1 Fashion Awards</i>.  Nothing signals muse-death better than a tune written 
    in front of the tube, and E, if it's not too late, cancel your cable-- or better yet, make like Elvis, grab a gun and blow the idiot box to shit.  There's a whole fucked-up post-9/11 world 
    out there to sing and make tasteless, morbid jokes about, and I know you've got more to give us than this.</p></div>"|2687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2687-shootenanny/|2.8|Chris Dahlen

I picked up the phone still groggy from my nap, and slowly tried to understand the upset voice on      the other end of the line.</p>
<p>""Hello?  This is he.  Yes, <i>Michigan Haters</i> is staying at my place, but only until I finish reviewing it.  No, I'm not its legal guardian, but-- may I ask      who's calling, please?  Mrs. who?  Well, Mrs. Indie Rock, could you please slow down and tell me what this is about?""</p>
<p>Apparently there had been an altercation at school: Mrs. Indie Rock's son, Bland, had been speaking to some girls at lunch, about his songs of angst and isolation, when      <i>Michigan Haters</i> started screamed so loudly that it sent Bland crying from the cafeteria.  He ran straight into the gym doors and wound up with black eye and a mild      concussion.  Mrs. Indie Rock is at the hospital, and she wants to know how I plan to handle the situation.  She wants an apology.</p>
<p>""Ma'am, I'm truly sorry that this happened.  I will speak with <i>Michigan</i> this evening, I assure you.  Too violent?  That's not really fair to say-- I don't think he's too violent at all.""</p>
<p>Certainly most of <i>Michigan Haters</i>-- especially the opener ""Bought a Grandfather Clock""-- tend towards abrasion with its apparently nihilistic regard for instrumentation,      but in the end this is the type of music that seems necessary as an outgrowth of other worthwhile genres, specifically Industrial music.  This is how I would have imagined groups      that followed in the footsteps of Throbbing Gristle and Coil to have sounded twenty years after the fact.  The title track is especially exemplary of this trend, as metal-against-metal      racket plays against the sound of broken radio transistors, atop a background of sophisticated free form percussion and guitar work.</p>
<p>""Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well, now, see I disagree on that point as well.  He's not a bully.""</p>
<p>Basing an opinion on a casual listen, one could argue that it displays a very static and homogeneous sound, but if the Indie Rock family-- Bland, in particular-- would only      take the time to listen with an open-ear, they might all might discover that there are a good deal of dynamics at work on <i>Michigan Haters</i>.  ""Chili Dog"" slows the tempo to      a relative halt, introducing a synthesized ping-pong rhythm that interplays with established, rising percussion.  A fuzzy bass accompanies both elements as the polyrhythmic piece      unfolds between the upper and lower register, loads of guitar effects keeping you transfixed. Closing with a reverb-laden guitar coda, ""Chili Dog"" helps put to rest any concerns that      so harsh a band couldn't both build and wreck suspense.</p>
<p>""Meaningless noise?! Ma'am, I think you should take a moment to think this through, before you say anything you might regret.""</p>
<p>While it's true that most of <i>Michigan Haters </i>ends up buried in the red, the album doesn't suffer from what you'd ordinarily expect from ""bad production.""  Songs such      as ""The Easy Answer"", ""Ihc-ic"", and ""I Feel Like A Porsche"" are meant to provoke a reaction with their imbalance, which goes hand-in-hand with the conceptual beauty of      contrasting high-end guitar screeches with low-end bass and percussive distortion.  The gluts of feedback act as a foil to the quieter moments culminating in the steel-drum      like ending of ""Guilty of Wrecking"", which takes the album out on an atonal, yet striking note.</p>
<p>""Of course I'm sorry about poor little Bland Indie Rock, but have you considered that <i>Michigan</i> only lashed out because your child is so fucking BORING?""</p>
<p>I hung up the phone, knowing it was a lost cause.  But ultimately, that's fine, and actually desirable: if rock music began as a rebellion against conservative parents, I'm happy      to open my doors to the son of a bitch that punked its lame grand-kid in the eye.  Sightings' latest doesn't think twice before lashing out, and in rock and roll, that's nothing to apologize for.</p></div>"|7143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7143-michigan-haters/|8.8|Andrew Bryant

Though he started making ambient house records in the early 90s, latter-day Terre Thaemlitz
    music is <em>not</em> for the background. Well, you <em>might</em> get away with playing a record while you read one of his lengthy essays from the CD
    booklet, thus interfacing with Thaemlitz's ideas on two levels simultaneously. But in general his theory-driven work requires both heavy
    concentration and a certain amount of back-end reflection to be absorbed. There's nothing light about his intent, concept, tone or sonics.</p><p>
<i>Lovebomb</i> is Thaemlitz' exploration of ""love"", and I use quotes because Thaemlitz is a skeptic. The tightly-spaced 32 pages of liner notes, which are written
    in both English and Japanese (Thaemlitz moved from the Bay Area to Tokyo) lay out in detail how, despite the spread of the West's version of ""love,""
    the meaning of the word still varies greatly from place to place, and indeed even within a single closed cultural system.</p><p>
    
    The essays that accompany the tracks provide the theoretical backing, but despite their liberal use of poststructuralist jargon, the meaning of the
    music is even less clear. This is a strange album. Having listened to it 15 times or more, I can hardly recall a thing about it once I slip it back into
    its case, and sometimes my memory doesn't even last that long. As <i>Lovebomb</i> is filled with odd pockets of silence ranging from a few seconds to a few
    minutes long, sometimes it's easy to forget that you're listening to music at all. The music seems designed to resist easy assimilation, and this is
    one of the more fragmented records I've heard. Tracks range from tiny snatches of sound to epics more than ten minutes long. There are
    plunderphonic cut-ups, noise, raw found recordings, ambient drones, delicate piano mediations...just as you're getting into one mode Thaemlitz he changes
    his pitch up, thus keeping you at arms length.</p><p>
    
    And yet, despite the pretension and the dense impenetrability, certain aspects of <i>Lovebomb</i> are so undeniably powerful that you have to give
    yourself over to Thaemlitz. First, there is ""Between Empathy and Sympathy is Time (Apartheid)"". On this track Thaemlitz takes an Apartheid-era militant
    speech from a member of South Africa's African National Congress and filters it through the music of Minnie Riperton's ""Lovin' You"". I mean ""filters""
    literally here. The speech is run through a vocoder that varies along with the Riperton tune, so that the words of the speech-- about acquiring
    weapons, killing policemen, bombing factories-- are shaped the harmonic qualities of the song. It's a haunting and utterly unique effect, and the
    track is difficult to describe in terms of emotional complexity. It's somehow sad, frightening, confusing, inspiring and intellectually engaging
    all at the same time.</p><p>
    
    And then there are several places where Thaemlitz' genius for sonic texture and dynamics come through. The title track moves from almost inaudible
    silence to room-shaking, bassed-out distortion and back again over its 10 minutes, but it somehow manages to remain compelling and coherent as a
    composition. And ""Sintesi Musicale del Linciaggio Futurista (Music Synthesis of Futurist Lynching)"" provides an interesting contrast between its minimal
    Music For Airports-style piano and a mangled spoken word collage. And in running down <i>Lovebomb</i>'s high points, I would be remiss if I failed to
    mention the gorgeous sleeve (drawings of a lynching and a scene from a subway terrorist attack are gussied up with scattered photographs of roses),
    which Thaemlitz illustrated and designed.</p><p>
    
    And somehow, some way, something about ""love"" is what ties all this together. It's difficult to understand the ideas at work without going back
    to the liner notes, but even the essays bring more questions than answers. In the CD booklet Thaemlitz offers, ""Love-- no matter how inexplicably
    mentally consuming-- is not so much an emotion as an equation of contextually specific cultural variables."" And elsewhere, ""Love is...a
    redundant construction of pacifying hysteria, a mandatory insult to appease our senses."" I'm not positive, but I <em>think</em> this is just a fancy way
    of saying:</p><p>
    
    I've had the blues<br/>
    The reds and the pinks<br/>
    One thing for sure<br/>
    Love stinks<br/>

    southeastern Karelian region.  The vocalists' distinctive, sharp style, accompanied by upright bass, violin, accordion and various woodwind 
    instruments was featured on two late 80s records only released in their own country.  These were regionally popular discs, but the band didn't 
    hit it big until the primary players (including current members Mari Kaasinen and Janne Lappalainen) jumped ship and formed a second, smaller 
    version of the band (in a turn oddly similar to the Amon Düül legacy).  This group released the internationally popular <i>Oi Dai</i> in 1990, which stuck close 
    to their folk roots but introduced a manic rock edge.  Imagine a tight gypsy band, nimbly dancing around impossible shifts in meter and speed, but 
    only in support of some of the most amazing vocals ever recorded. VärttixE4's singing reminds me of the late-80s' Mystere des Voix Bulgares series on 
    Elektra/Nonesuch, with their high register acrobatics and almost piercing unison lines.  In short, they might think stuff is old hat 
    in Finland, but to me it sounds like the party music of Nordic war gods.</p><p>
<i>Iki</i> is VärttixE4's ninth studio record, and their best since that remarkable 1990 LP; it's especially welcome after a lengthy period wherein they 
    appeared to be going for some kind of adult-contemporary crossover (most notably on 1996's underwhelming <i>Kokko</i>) but ended up sounding 
    like a tart, unplugged ABBA.  The tempos have slowed a tad over the years, and the vocalists aren't dazzling you with fireworks so much as enticing with 
    intricate harmonies and tender expression, but with that said, much of this will still get your blood moving if you let it. Karelian folk seems to have some 
    kind of built-in adrenaline, so even when things don't seem that hectic, they're brimming with kinetic energy nonetheless.</p><p>
    Versions of ""Syyllinen Syli"" (from traditional verse, though VärttixE4 perform mostly original music now) bookend <i>Iki</i>, and illustrate perfectly the 
    kind of passion the group are able to pull out of harmonies and phrasing that must be hundreds of years old.  The song is apparently about an unfaithful 
    husband, and the minor-key melody makes it pretty clear these women are none to happy about the guy.  However, despite the powerful wail of the trio of 
    vocalists on the second version, it's Kaasinen's delicate solos on both tracks that overwhelm me.  I'm not really the type to go on about 
    someone's voice, but hers is simply gorgeous.  ""Tuulen Tunto"" adds a full band, a dreamy, almost elfin ballad; the vocalists soar over an 
    opulent arrangement of accordion, violin and acoustic guitar as the gentle piece takes on an angelic timbre.</p><p>
    ""Tauti"" (translated as ""Disease"") is an aggressive odd-metered jaunt, with some of the best singing on the record.  The band hacks into the piece with 
    precision, and the violin drops a few harrowing lines to send some folks into celebratory convulsions while causing others to trip all over themselves.  
    Again, it's hard to tell whether this music is happy and fun or brutal and warlike, but when it provokes my blood to boil 
    so, I cease splitting hairs.  Susan Aho's ""Maahinen Neito"" (""Earth-Maiden"", which betrays the mythological tint to much of this music) succeeds even 
    further at this: dark guitar figures, misty reeds and a cutting bass support her vocal, which sounds at once a warning and a seduction.  The tune 
    explodes into a chorus of three-part harmony and slashing cymbals, at which point everything gets witchy, with a disembodied moan and unison drone 
    replacing the previous restless dance.  The outro slams all of this into one manic pot, and goes away just as quickly.  Fucking <i>breathless</i>.</p><p>
    There's a lot to recommend here, but I'll provide the caveat that if you absolutely hate the modal adventures of bands like John Zorn's Masada, 
    of Pachora, Les Voix des Bulgares or any number of Eastern European folk groups, this might not be up your alley.  One of VärttixE4's attributes is 
    that they seem to have little problem translating faraway jams into something a whole bunch of people can understand, so an obscuro-fetish is 
    hardly required.  Uskomaton!</p></div>"|8516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8516-iki/|8.3|Dominique Leone

Our rivalry to the death is going okay, thanks; we're currently interviewing contractors to construct us a Thunderdome. 
    It started, predictably, with him throwing a Twinkie at my face during an argument about Xiu Xiu. My platelets were particularly low that afternoon, and my lip hemorrhaged all over 
    the office, ruining my homemade Silver Apples tee. Anyway, the man CANNOT HAVE FUN. Somehow his pleasure-receptors got all crosswired with his analytical lobe, and he 
    thinks thinking is fun. Check his reviews in our nifty archive to behold his pedigrist polemiciana.</p><p>
    So you know what band is a lot of fun? Numbers. You know who dissed the frozen shit out of their recent long-player? Ott. He turned in another of his ""State Of The Legacy Of 
    Something Or Other"" reviews, claiming they were a rich man's Devo or Gary Numan (don't get me started about the day Pitchfork's Ry Schreiber chucked one of our 
    ergonomic pencil sharpeners at me for defending Devo). Ott's disrespect was writ large when he didn't even get their album title right. It's called <i>Numbers Life</i>, not <i>Life</i>, so 
    nyaah, you exacting motherscratcher!  Yes, Numbers is derivative as all hellhole, their sound a clone xeroxing its carbon-copied dub of a fascimile's simulacrumatic twindred. 
    But they are so damn fun, barking dumb automaton slogans to junkily stilted laptop-punk ad giddeum. More, I say.</p><p>
    Ssshhh, but Ott even donned a camo beret to ""ban"" us from reffing the holy war on terror or Bush's apocalyptic road map in our reviews. But dude, every news farticle I read about 
    mini-nukes or Frankenfood or Halliburton or North Korea or Jihad McFatwa makes me desperate for some righteous escape through which to exhaust and celebrate my raw youth! 
    You know what band is great for a night of who-cares-we're-already-dead? Numbers. </p><p>
<i>Death</i> is a buoyant collection of remixes and restagings, principally of work from <i>Numbers Life</i>, and it manages to expound on the post-humanity of its source material, setting Indra 
    Dunis' chants of answering machine lingo and traffic patterns against a grid of rabid oom-chicka. The ho-hum rating above is to placate the PhD-seekers in glitchography who 
    scour this website; <i>Death</i> offers nothing groundbreaking in the field of DJ overhauls. But that does not stop it from being frequently awesome, as each contributor's cheesy or 
    noisome configuration combines to predict what would happen if Negativland looted C&amp;C; Music Factory.</p><p>
    Though this incognito Anglo also gets mega-dissed, I don't care about his street resume: Gold Chains' assault on Numbers' ""Prison Life"" offers a hilarious intro, then takes a band 
    who sounds like '74-'77 Devo and reduces them funnily to '94 (<i>Smooth Noodle Maps</i>-era) Devo, before he busts into a Body-Count-ish punk skrang, bringing to mind grunge outliers 
    Clawhammer and their album of Devo covers. That lauded klepto, Kid 606, turns in the least interesting of three versions of Numbers' consumer-anthem ""We Like Having These Things""; 
    while Dwayne Sodahberk's take provides a slice of funk deprogramming itself, spoof act Zeigenbock Kopf outrocks both of these renditions with their speaker-shattering Teutonic 
    gay-porn-a-thon, which swaps Numbers' hankering for Chinese cultural revolution syntax with phrases such as ""morning erections,"" ""man abuser,"" ""dance-floor manpiles,"" and ""bathroom sweatfest."" As if an electro Turbonegro wasn't inevitable; relish this violation of Numbers' daffy culture-critiquing.</p><p>
    Dymaxion's ""What Is The Product"" sounds like Pink Floyd's ""Money"" done up by Pizzicato Five and Dee-Lute until it unfortunately starts relying on Speak-n-Spell vocal tones, which 
    have been quasi-passe since right before Beck abused them. Uprock's ""Alphanumeric Disinformation"" fascinatingly deconstructs Numbers' ""Information"" to a paramecium state, 
    never letting it really start for three-and-a-half-minutes. Face it, Ott, this disc bumps! I love hearing rhythmagicans plug Numbers songs into their computers, atop our culture of 
    people caressing their cellphones and glaring at cars like they need to hump the gashole. Numbers is right! Language is a code! Rock is a treadmill!</p><p>
    Choose <i>Death</i>. I don't want to meet the person too icy to enjoy Original Hamster's wonderfully spastic, maximum-overdriven, Wal-Martyred handling of Numbers' subway intercom 
    ode ""Human Replace"".  And, yo-ho, Kit Clayton's ""Information"" blends anarchy with limo-booty way better than Aphex Droid. But when I told Ott what I was reviewing, he said, 
    sniggeringly, for me to include how he was a ""total culture fascist."" He even accused me of pining for robo-chanteuse Indra Dunis. I simply must brain him with a brass spittoon. 
    Have a machine day, dear reader, same as it ever was, same as it ever was.  Same as it ever was.</p></div>"|5865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5865-death/|6.9|William Bowers

Dandelions, and breezy windfalls.  My knees got weak from the aroma, the sense of a smart man writing what was 
    on his mind, and not being so cynical that he doused his thoughts in the petals of harmony. Instead, he doused his music in stories.  They could be real, they could be fake, but you don't know 
    for sure because they're just too vague for interpretation, and you don't wanna project your own shit onto music this nice, this universal. You don't wanna dump your own problems onto it. This 
    music is about feelings-- not emotions, feelings-- like the sixth sense you get when summer's about to break, when the mail carrier's about to deliver a package to your door, when someone's about 
    to break your heart but it's okay 'cause Life. Is. Awesome.</p><p>
    
    The Long Winters are a wholly life-affirming band, helmed by acclaimed Seattle songwriter John Roderick.  He's backed by drummer Michael Shilling, bassist Eric Corson, and former Harvey Danger 
    vocalist/keyboardist Sean Nelson-- his regular boys.  Oh, and a 26-person ensemble of violinists, tamborinists, and producers, including Chris Walla and Peter Buck.  You get the feeling that, 
    during the taping of this album, Long Winters, et al. were flipping somersaults in the studio, or smooshed all together like moppets. You feel as if they are screaming even when they're not, 
    because they are taking gigantic breaths, letting air fill their guts full.</p><p>
    
    It's just straight rock and roll, really, and I mean <i>really straight rock and roll.  There's a tinge of folk, a tiny, tiny dash of mid-level Beatles/Kinks...it has the same wildflower fragrance 
    as </i><i>120 Minutes</i> circa 1991. R.E.M.? World Party? ""Sowing the Seeds of Love""?!  Anything is possible. And here, ""anything"" is the elimination of hippie-ness in music that sounds so 
    wholly optimistic.</p><p>
    
    It's all in the harmonies. Sure there's unmitigated rosy joy blossoming from every boppy keyboard hinge, a gleaming simplicity that's neither sentimental nor under-thought, but makes 
    you feel so good is Roderick's sometimes-craggy, mostly regular-guy yelp, as it sweetly rubs up against Nelson's familiar tweet (""familiar"" as in Harvey Danger's ""Flagpole Sitta"", which you may 
    or may not recall blasting from every college dorm a few years ago).  Crashing waves of distortion cut out to reveal a spry orchestra of stringed instruments, ebbing and flowing as the pair sing, 
    ""I'm countin' on you to throw more than shapes!""</p><p>
<i>When I Pretend to Fall</i> is not without imperfections; for one, it's a little too glossy, but then again, I'm used to recordings where people jam up their laptop outlets with dirty rags 
    dipped in ether and Vaseline. One grave misstep is the album's closer, ""Nora"", which is horribly heavy on the cymbal and cheesy with its guitar solo.  Roderick also sings the finale in an 
    unbecoming, monotonous drawl, a shame of a parting impression since he's best when he's skipping around the scales like a lop rabbit.</p><p>
    
    Teeming with the ""nice"" and major-key action, Long Winters can at times get a little barfy. But time is on there side, as right now the sun is out, life is rad, and their sometimes too-simple songs are 
    nothing if not solid.  What the fuck, I can dig it.</p></div>"|4844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4844-when-i-pretend-to-fall/|7.2|Julianne Shepherd

It seems almost impossible, but Watchers have found a way, though I doubt they were looking for one. They want to be the life of the party, but like the  kid you gave near-beer that acts hammered, they're trying way too hard.  <i>To the Rooftops</i>, their debut full-length, can't contain its own ambition, combining angry post-punk funk with  world-music dub and hints of Chicago's post-rock, post-hardcore, post-everything scene.  Which is by now post-entertaining.</p><p>  These disparate styles are braced together so rigidly that all fluidity is lost, resulting in stilted, workmanlike compositions that play it off casual, but sound like they were recorded at gunpoint.  Part of the trouble is that, while they cycle through a huge swath of distinctly different genres, all the elements are tossed together in indistinct ways, at incongruous times.  Not one  of the myriad modes they draw inspiration from becomes a clear anchor for any of their songs, ""Follow Me, Follower"" excepted.  Basically, they sound a lot like mid-period Talking Heads without the...is ""edge"" the word I'm looking for? Maybe it's ""coke.""  Whether or not they're purposely recycling ""Burning Down the House"", regurgitation like this is rarely exciting.</p><p>  Michael Guarrine sings with the ice-cold confidence of an evangelical David Byrne, going so far as to duplicate his signature staccato enunciation; the band firmly embraces the  funk-punk-fused polyrhythms exemplified on 'Heads tracks like ""Cities"" and ""Life During Wartime"", but the pop sensibility to smooth out those rough angles is absent.  Instead, Watchers dwell on  post-punk anxiety, lending these tunes a forced, undeserving gravity.</p><p>  Not all of <i>To the Rooftops</i> is marred by such a contradictory sense of over-seriousness.  Though plodding, twitchy cuts like ""Gold Standard"" and ""The Dirty Sponsor"" feel like a  chore so early in the record, stiffened by monotonous, dry beats and a stockroom of old, half-hearted funk riffs, things improve as the album draws to a close. The aforementioned  ""Follow Me, Follower"" delivers some unique energy at last: chugging guitar and surprisingly slick bass give the tune a recognizable face, something Watchers can call their own amid a  sea of characterless clichés.  They go on to do themselves one better with ""Taxiland"", the record's obvious highlight; off-kilter rhythms and deliriously unbalanced guitar lines give the  song a woozy, spiraling charm, and somehow still preserve its fundamental dancefloor appeal.</p><p>  ""When the Night Comes"" is a decent-enough finale, relying on the band's few strengths, but it only begs the question, ""Why couldn't the first half of <i>To the Rooftops</i> have been this  engaging?""  Terrible production doesn't help, as nothing comes even remotely close to breaking out of this cardboard-flat mix, but as problematic as these uniform levels are, it  still comes back to the Watchers' overly sober, suspect sonic mixture.</p><p> 
    Despite their obvious efforts to enthrall and entice with punk-funk riffs, this throw-down has all the spontaneity of an office birthday party.  Guarrine howls ""Cut loose!"" as the 
    oh-so-strained funk underpinnings of this music try to play along, but it feels like the off-hours rebellion of your coworkers.   Like most parties, it takes a little time for things to heat 
    up, and the band gradually settles into a smoother, more vibrant art-funk groove after the initial stiffness, but by the time they come around to their formless 9-5 lament ""My Cube"", 
    the Watchers have loosened the restraints as far as they're gonna.  The implicit sentiment is still ""Your ten-minute break is over in five minutes,"" and everyone knows the door to the roof 
    is locked.</p></div>"|8759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8759-to-the-rooftops/|5.7|Eric Carr

    ""Walking the Dog"".  Apparently this boy genius had been raiding Mom and Dad's record cabinet and discovered the percussive, muted guitar
    breaks at the end of each chorus as those future <em>Behind the Music</em> posterboys tried desperately to be as funky as Rufus Thomas.  His
    conclusion?  That Joe Perry had invented scratching.</p><p>
    
    Now, I don't know what happened to this kid after high school, but I think it's safe to assume he's not a logic professor.  Still, maybe he was more
    prescient than I'm giving him credit for, considering that within a  year of his prophecy, Run D.M.C. and the toxic twins' cover of ""Walk This Way""
    dominated MTV and radio alike.  Wait, come on-- anyone who's even remotely aware of hip-hop knows scratching ain't scratching unless
    there's a turntable involved.</p><p>
    
    Not surprisingly, Aerosmith are nowhere to be found on <em>Scratchology</em>, the latest mix CD in a series that previously put the Beat Junkies' DJ
    Babu, Dan the Automator and Slum Village to the mixtape challenge.  This time around, Sequence aims to outline the history of scratching with
    tracks selected and mixed by that highest-profile of turntablist crews, the X-ecutioners.  Moving from 1981 to the present, in roughly chronological
    order, the X-men sprinkle spoken testimonials in with impeccably arranged rare tracks and standard-bearers, giving the disc an aural
    documentary feel that, though nowhere near comprehensive (and it's not intended to be), is as enlightening as it is enjoyable.</p><p>
    
    After an adroit X-men introduction, they get right to work with the first scratch-oriented song ever recorded, ""The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on
    the Wheels of Steel""-- the best possible point of entry with Flash's sleight-of-hand effortlessly turning ""Rapper's Delight"" into ""Another One
    Bites the Dust"" and back again, like a hip-hop David Copperfield.  From there, it's a short ride through the 80s, touching on both the ubiquitous
    and the ultra-rare.  Herbie Hancock's electrojazz masterpiece ""Rock It""-- once renowned more for its video's creepy robots-- stands as
    testimony to the scratching skills of Grand Mixer DXT.  Mixmaster Gee's ""Like This (Full &amp; Fresh)"" is just the contrary; according to X-man Rob
    Swift, ""A lot of people don't even know this record exists,"" increase <i>Scratchology</i>'s value tenfold.</p><p>
    
    The 90s section runs a little heavy on back-patting with solo tracks by Swift and fellow X-ecutioner Roc Raida, along with several more by various
    combinations of their contemporary crews, The Beat Junkies and Invisibl Skratch Piklz.  Of these, Raida's ""I'll Kick Ya Ass"" definitely fulfills its
    promise in a back-to-basics nod to some of the disc's earlier cuts.  Also representing for that decade: a Pete Rock mix of Public Enemy's ""Shut Em
    Down"" and Gang Starr's ""DJ Premier in Deep Concentration,"" two fine examples from scratch-masters who came to prominence in the late 80s and chose
    to work through most of the 90s with emcees, rather than banding together with fellow turntablists.</p><p>
    
    The X-men even throw in ""Premier's X-ecution""-- one of the few redeeming moments from last year's <em>Built for Scratch</em>-- a DJ equivalent of the
    posse cut that sounds much fresher far, far away from that record's Linkin Park love-in.  If you thought, as I did, that the X-ecutioners had
    ditched their integrity for five minutes on MTV, don't count them out just yet: let this bit of DJ history as heard through their ears serve
    as a statement of intent, and hope their next record of original material delivers substantial evidence.</p></div>"|1978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1978-scratchology-mixed-by-the-x-ecutioners/|7.5|Scott Hreha

    band that exists outside contemporary musical trends, yet makes absolute sense within them.  Quite simply, Pinback are an original pop band, and these days, you can
    almost count their peers on two hands.</p><p>
    
    I saw Rob Crow and Armistead Burwell Smith IV a few months ago, at a bar staffed by muscle-bound, black-clad bouncers and tall, blonde, half-shirted
    waitresses carrying illuminated trays. It was the first time I'd seen the band in person, and this bizarre, conservative setting seemed all wrong; in my
    imagination, theirs was background music for firefly-infested fields and laid-back loft parties.  What's worse, the club was packed, and it had a <i>smoke
    machine</i>, which pumped furiously and pointlessly before Pinback even took the stage. By the time they'd gathered their army of DAT machines, it
    was way too late for my wide-eyed excitement. They sounded pretty-- as expected-- but after four or five songs I left, dejected.</p><p>
    
    What a fucking letdown after I'd waited four years to see them!  Still, leaving early didn't bother me: I was only interested in seeing how well they'd pull
    their quiet magic off in front of staring eyes and the tired commentary of drunken goons. After a few songs, I'd seen all I needed,
    which is one of the beautiful things about Pinback: their work is a single volume of slight variation.  You could cut and paste their output together as
    one big landscape of clouds, mist and plaintive sounds. And some complain, but I like the unwavering steadiness of their vision.</p><p>
    
    Pinback have added layers as time's goes on, but otherwise, the narrative arc is entirely predictable, and all the better for it. This isn't some kind
    of underhanded compliment; you don't listen to or watch Pinback to be surprised, you welcome their aesthetic, because it lends the same nostalgic
    recognition as the smell of a freshly mown lawn.</p><p>
    
    The main difference on <i>Offcell</i> is that the guitar and bass tracks sound more live and full, more ""rock"" for lack of a better word.
    I've always enjoyed the interiority of the duo's work, and would hate to see take on the boring mid-ranges of most indie twaddle, but they did record this
    EP in Smith IV's new studio, so this ""low-key technique""-- not so anal and arcane-- is probably just a byproduct of their surroundings (and,
    yes, as with their other releases, we get moody images of their gear).</p><p>
<i>Offcell</i> starts with the three-part ""Microtonic Wave"", which leads with a damp, sandy guitar, offset by piano and chimes.  After a quick shift into
    the patented baritone/falsetto harmonizing, and bleak, often cryptic lyrics-- ""Cauterize my scars in scum""--  brief stardust vocals murmur and sigh
    below the persistent but dainty chimes. They've thankfully dropped the tired, ill-advised nautical fetish of old, instead finding inspiration in digital waves and
    telephones.</p><p>
    
    ""Victorious D"" is improbably gorgeous, especially because it's such a bruised fruit. When I saw them perform it live, I wondered how
    they'd bury the bass line on record, and if Crow was supposed to be singing so absently off-key in the bridge. Seeing how they struggled
    through its ambitious melodies in concert, it's exciting to hear the resolution: Crow intones ""Angels suffering/ Angels fall from light/ Angels sickening/ Angels suffer,""
    giving way to Armistead's higher-pitched response, which accrues a perfection all the more triumphantly on-the-mark.</p><p>
<i>Offcell</i>'s midpoint is a lesser version of ""Tripoli"", from their 1998 debut.  The band's never topped that one, that first song on their first record:
    its sunny instrumentation hid the ""sad I'm gonna die"" lyrics for weeks, and only over time, like a slow-release pill, did its intent emerge.  ""B"" is Pinback
    as garage rock: distorted guitars blending into computer blips and drum machines, the rust and angular gears of their vintage gear praising an idiot god.
    I thought of the town ""B"", from William H. Gass' <i>In The Heart of the Heart of the Country</i>, a place of revulsion and poetic repose. As in ""Tripoli"", there's
    again a discrepancy between the cheery musicality and creepy lyrics, drones in the air and kids down spiral stairs:  ""Mommas tell your babies not to rest inside
    your will/ Kids in refrigerators won't scratch their way out, and never will.""</p><p>
    
     ""Grey Machine""-- an eleven-minute, string-based doo-wop romance-- streaks across the sky, considering space and time before retreating into the more immediate
     powers of memory.  I don't want Pinback to break-up, but in a way, this unique, potent bag of sweets would be a nice finale to what began so gloriously with
     ""Tripoli"" in 1998.  You'll have to excuse my romanticism-- and don't worry, there's a Touch and Go full-length due in 2004-- but this grand epic, after many minutes
     and layered sounds, delivers its own aching epitaph: ""Pick me up/ Take me home/ Get me out of here/ Please.""</p></div>"|6297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6297-offcell/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

John put down the sheers for a moment to stress the impact of his next statement, ""It was raining so hard, its what we used to call 'dropping
    pitchforks and nigger-babies' on the land.""</p><p>
    
    He had been my barber for nearly all my life, so I knew the uselessness of trying to argue with the old man.  It was simply one of those moments that you face where you have to grin and
    bear it, realizing that not everyone is fortunate enough to know enlightenment in the modern age.  Countless discussions with him-- coifed crown in the opposite direction of his
    Southern drawl-- had yielded scarce results in changing John's viewpoint.  The key to his salvation (and ours) is in the realization that future generations will wince and learn from
    the mistakes of the past; righting wrongs and carrying on in what will hopefully be an improved manner.</p><p>
    
    While no music can be considered an equal iniquity to racial slurs, if I had to pick a single pseudo-genre that was the closest to it-- and it happens to be experiencing a recent resurgence--
    I would choose the music of the 1980s.  The heavy reliance on synthesizers and childish notions of lyrical sincerity that the stereotypical 80s music was made of bring about nearly the same feelings
    of vehement distaste and disgust as the use of the n-word in casual conversation.  Dismissal of the genre would be a grievous crime in the long run though, just as it would be
    wrong to put someone like John to death for doing what he's always been taught to do.  Constructively, it would be wiser to learn from the spirit of the not-forgotten past,
    without strict adherence to any woebegone or vulgar ideology.  Enter former-Grifters member David Shouse and his latest musical incarnation, The Bloodthirsty Lovers.</p><p>
    
    Turning away from his most recent gig with Those Bastard Souls, Shouse's latest project experiments with the slight elements of the 80s listed above in his bout to infuse a salvaged
    period in pop's history with a refreshed viewpoint and some refined ideas.  Falling into a more subdued pattern of melody and rhythm, Shouse partially succeeds in his goal, creating interesting
    songs that catalog some new tricks for this old dog.</p><p>
    
    On ""Hardcore"", Shouse and his cronies-- drummer Paul Taylor from the North Mississippi Allstars and keyboardist Thom Krupski-- lay out their finest blueprint with a tinny
    beat overlapped by slowly evolving, distorted bass.  The song progresses not unlike a heavier Cocteau Twins, except that instead of building to suspense, it leads itself
    towards stagnancy, content with its own aimless wandering before it weakly peters out.</p><p>
    
    ""Call Off the Thugs"" begins with an ambient synth-intro that sounds like a poor man's Brian Eno or later-day Tangerine Dream, eventually melting into gentle guitar strumming accompanied by
    a frail drum program.  Similar to the tracks ""Telepathic"", ""Transgression #9"" and ""Take the Time"", the song eventually becomes too focused on the bland repetition of its basic patterns,
    ultimately leading to a loss of all interest.  ""Sonic Letter to Sara Jean"" behaves likewise, but the by-now usual fuzz is interchanged with the harder ""thump"" of programmed bass,
    as retrograde instrumentation flutters around a buried falsetto.  The track makes further use of neo-psychedelic elements, sounding at times like a modern version of Tomorrow's ""My White
    Bicycle"" in its backwards guitar phrasing and obtuse lyrics.</p><p>
    
    ""Datapunk"" emerges as one of the stand out tracks on the album, borrowing most heavily from the beat-heavy 80s, tagging what sounds like a Scott La Rock backing track
    onto a weary distorted bass, with electronic flourishes punctuating every down beat.  Though one of the shortest tracks on the album, it summarizes the band's stated philosophy of assimilation
    and defiance to the utmost.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately,  TBLs make an attempt to outrun the demons of their inspired past, and they are in the end overcome by the burden of previous blunders.  The kitsch value of Shouse's current
    vehicle still makes one's jaw clinch at times, no matter how sincerely he pulls off certain aspects of the endeavor.  He admits in an interview on the Southern Records
    website that this album was ""99% me; the next one will be a band project.""  Perhaps tempered by the opinions of his bandmates, Shouse will reel in his unpleasant superfluities, and
    release a record in the near future to propagate the prouder elements of his new sound, excluding those that encumber this debut.</p></div>"|810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/810-bloodthirsty-lovers/|6.8|Andrew Bryant

A woman 
    slowly begins to mumble.  The noise threatens to rise to a boil, to cohere, to build into a perfect expression of icy beauty, but it never does.  It goes nowhere, limply plodding through a lackluster 
    haze of underproduction.  Meanwhile, deep in the Alaskan wilderness, a sled dog sheds a single tear in the snow.</p><p>
    
    So, welcome to the bottom of Pitchfork's review column!  There are days when decent releases wind up down here simply by default-- bad timing, mostly-- but today is not one of those days.  
    Obviously, not everything that crosses our desks is a work of unqualified genius, but every so often, a disc so encroaches on the gag reflex that it becomes necessary to issue a warning.  So, 
    I'm just going to pull out some of our patented critical orange cones and yellow crossing tape and put up a big barrier around this reissue in the hopes that you won't make the same mistake 
    I did.</p><p>
    
    Did you catch that?  This is a reissue, meaning that at different points in time, two different labels felt this album was worth your time.  This is Iditarod's 1998 debut, back in stores for God knows what 
    reason.  Excellent for beer coasters and torturing people with perfect pitch, this album manages to simultaneously give ambient, slowcore and folk a bad name.  And the good folks at BlueSanct 
    have even tacked on <i>nine</i> bonus tracks, nearly doubling the length of the album.  Guys, you shouldn't have.  No, I mean you really shouldn't have.  Making it twice as long just makes this album 
    twice as bad, though, truth be told, the bonus tracks are better than the original...material. </p><p>
    
    Questions abound: Is the spelling of Nektar in the title a reference to the German prog band?  Is it cool to cover Brian Eno even if your cover doesn't do him any justice?  If you took the nice acoustic 
    guitar part from ""Providence"" and mixed it with the weird noise from ""The Lorelei"", might it add up to something interesting?  Why couldn't there be more songs like the dark acoustic guitar 
    instrumental (and bonus track) ""Move""?  What is the sound of one hand clapping?  Is there anything on TV? </p><p>
    
    In 1998, Iditarod were basically a duo comprising guitarist Jeffrey Alexander and vocalist Carin Wagner, and sweet Lord did they make some boring music.  Alexander must have slept with his 
    guitar-- an assumption I base on the fact that it sounds as if he's playing it in his sleep.  Aside from the fact that his guitar is sometimes slightly out of tune, he's not 
    technically horrific, it's just that his chosen idiom keeps him uninteresting and repetitive.  Wagner's trembling, uncertain mumble on the other hand, that can't even be described as 
    quasi-melodic-- pitch and key were discoveries not yet in the offing, apparently.  It's like listening to a folk duo warm up before recording, something I doubt is a 
    thrilling prospect to most listeners. </p><p>
    
    A couple of tracks add some interesting textures, in the form of scraped guitar strings or singing bowls, and their subsequent releases have thankfully moved in this direction, but their 
    barely-considered debut is just excruciating.  Huskies and their mushers deserve better tribute than this-- you definitely deserve better than this.  And George Washington deserves to have 
    his crumpled green effigy exchanged for better than this.   By and large, I think the recent trend toward reissuing every note ever played by anyone has enormous potential for good, frequently 
    digging up forgotten sessions and lost albums that deserve to be heard.  But there is a point where it goes too far-- certain bands' baby steps just aren't worth revisiting.</p><p>
    
    I'm grasping for balance here-- Iditarod really have improved since this album first came out, and there are hints of neat things to come here and there, the best of which is the 
    vaguely medieval textures and scraped and blown instruments that close out ""Mariner"".  But a few merely curious moments-- and then only as harbingers-- cannot salvage this thing, 
    a mostly shapeless lump of sparse almost-folk, almost-anti-folk  that will frustrate your ears and have you begging for one fully-realized song.</p></div>"|4059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4059-the-river-nektar/|2.1|Joe Tangari

It was in Memphis-- not the ancient one nestled on the banks of the Nile, the one situated along the Mississippi.  In the early sixties, before the Beatles 
    landed upon our shores and seeded the hippies. During those years, young kids became interested in the sounds of folk and blues, scarcely realizing that their Negro gardeners and 
    street-sweepers were once prominent Blues recording artists in their own right before the Depression hit. Right under their noses, folks like Furry Lewis played and sang the blues, 
    scant houses down from them.</p><p>
    Fast-forward to late-90s Williamsburg. After scoring increasingly pricey Brian Eno ambient records like <i>Music for Airports</i> and <i>Discreet Music</i> on Bedford Ave., a group of 
    tousle-headed hipsters walk up to look for cheeky furniture at a vintage store called Lady Bird. Little do they realize that the store's proprietor, William Basinski, beyond the daytime gaze 
    of his patrons, spends his nights distilling string signals from the radio waves into loops of melodic ellipses, weaving them back together like Mark Rothko's blanket, suggesting 
    resonant depth far beyond the surface of radio static. It's something that Basinski has been doing in secret for decades, realizing the symphonies behind refrigerator hum, jackhammers, 
    bum mumbles, subway screech, night bleats, and the low volumes of Klaus Schultze records left looping in the loft space, gleaning the aleatoric ambience of such noises and acting 
    as alembic for their salient features. <i>The River</i>, recorded in 1983, marks the first time any of this work has seen wide release: 1998's <i>Shortwave Music</i> was an impossibly rare 12-inch 
    (also on Raster-Noton), and the rest of his discography is a numbered assortment of self-released CD-Rs.</p><p>
<i>The River</i> washes out your internal clock.  Like the opening currents of Can's <i>Future Days</i>, it lulls you into dream-state. Drowned siren songs and dolphin chirps surface, 
    AM symphonies and Muzak backwash swirl around, a reverberating snap crackle 'n' pop coursing over it all as it begins to move. Over the hour and a half of spectral waves, the tides 
    heave heavenwards and back. Try as I can to hold on, there are no markers to indicate how far I've sunk into the music. If one image that continually 
    loops through my mind as I drift, it is of an enormous ballet of ghostly zeppelins in the midnight sky, filled with careening ball lightning, hovering over the surface of the ocean, its ripples 
    of water swollen with whale songs, rising and falling in a grand, gargantuan gesture.</p><p>
    In terms of psychoactive aural properties, the echoing freefall and slowly evolving twirls of bliss-smoke are reminiscent of another two-disc drop through Nirvana, that of the Taj Mahal 
    Travelers' <i>August 1974</i>. But the emotional undertow here could only match fathoms with a minimalist classic like Gavin Bryars' <i>The Sinking of the Titanic</i>. But <i>The River</i> is 
    without context, an Alka-Seltzer commercial for transubstantiated Body of Christ tabs, peregrinating as they descend to the bottom of the Dead Sea's drinking glass, captured in 
    slow-motion by structuralist filmmaker Michael Snow.</p><p> 
    Though it's taken twenty years for these waves to reach 21st century shores, they don't show many wrinkles. In fact, <i>The River</i> is so far ahead of its time that in hindsight, it 
    could only have made sense this far downstream, after the ambitious radio documentation of fringe noises such as the Conet Project's ""numbers transmissions"" and the noises 
    incorporated into two of last year's more aurally exciting pop releases, Wilco's <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> and the Trail of Dead's <i>Source Tags and Codes</i> (both integrated 
    the sounds of shortwave radios, albeit only to make their guitar songs a bit weirder). It's a final justice that these clippings so mysteriously divined from the heavens can exist on 
    their own infinite plane.</p></div>"|576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/576-the-river/|8.8|Andy Beta

    Andrew Broder), and the shrewdest Minneapolis hipsters might recognize him by his club moniker, the
    farcically straightforward DJ Andrew, but on <i>Ether Teeth</i>-- his second full-length-- he is,
    conveniently, all Fog.  Broder's latest alias is an appropriate metaphor for <i>Ether Teeth</i>'s eleven
    wispy, befuddling tracks: alternately gorgeous and jarring, soothing and repetitive, <i>Ether Teeth</i>
    is a hypnotic, moody collection of experimental guitar wails, lush piano, eclectic sampling, and ethereal,
    hissing blank space.</p><p>
    
    Bursting forth from the collage-driven DJ tradition (Prince Paul to Kid Koala), Fog is obviously well-versed
    in the process of snatching and reusing, infusing his tracks with occasionally ironic spots of found sound.
    The general problem with found stuff-- be it a Diana Ross backbeat or a canary-- is that the act of
    recognition is not an especially artful endeavor in and of itself.  Recontextualization is hip-hop's founding
    principle, but it's a tenet based on the idea that sampling should involve skillful arranging and sequencing,
    not straight up cutting and pasting.  Appropriation and transplanting requires ingenious tweaking in order
    to deserve a stamp of reinvention; to become the painting-- not just the wall it's hanging on.</p><p>
    
    Fog, fortunately, realizes this-- his snagged material, which can consist of anything from film dialogue, to
    conversations, to fragments of old songs, to birds, birds, birds-- are placed over alarmingly beautiful,
    droning guitar chords and splatters of piano.  Despite a couple of rough spots, <i>Ether Teeth</i> is largely
    composed of sublime moments in which the sound becomes part of the song, complimenting the melodies and
    functioning cohesively rather than extraneously.  ""Plum Dumb"" is a heart-stopping, expertly assembled opener
    that layers rich guitar plucking over a Casio-looped classical drone and buzzing, almost-human turntable
    slips.  A creepy choral refrain of ""which nobody can deny!"" eases in like a second melody; soon, a
    meandering piano line snakes through, building to a thunderous, overwhelming climax before easing back
    out and ending on a breathtaking choral sample, now louder, stranger, and throatier.</p><p>
    
    The foot-stomping ""What a Day Day"" is more straightforward: snarky, sarcastic and fueled by aggressive
    acoustic guitar, Fog's charmingly haphazard singing finds a contextual home here.  After an unpredictable
    two minutes, it bursts into a chorus on par with the best melodramatic piano ballads from the 70s: ""If you
    need me, call my lawyer."" Another archaic vocal sample pops up at the end, warning everyone to ""get out of
    Terrible Town"" and ""go on to Lovelyville.""</p><p>
    
    ""The Girl from the Gum Commercial"" opens with some nicely obnoxious open-mouthed gum mauling; these smacks
    sound oddly percussive against a rudimentary piano melody and quiet guitar strums, like sticky, high-pitched
    drums.  Fog's voice sneaks around the tune, sometimes loud, sometimes inaudible, but the track vehemently
    refuses to follow any sort of logical, linear path.  It's a dynamic trick: if you've got the patience to
    stick it out for five minutes, the alarming turntable debauchery halfway through should substantiate the
    investment for most.</p><p>
    
    It's the winning (if anything-but-cheery) ""Cheerupcheerily"" where Fog's isolated misery is most dramatically
    defined.  As an ambient swell-- almost certainly snatched from a U2 track, and quite possibly the instrumental
    ""Korova 1""-- loops repeatedly, the song gradually builds into a clarinet-dotted wail of distortion so focused
    and thin, it threatens to tear a hole through your line of sight.  Like cinema's recent Americana melodramas,
    it's a meditation on ache and desire that's at once aware of its insignificance in the scope of things.</p><p>
<i>Ether Teeth</i> sags briefly midway through-- ""No Boys Allowed"" and ""Apologizing to Mystery"" are both
    half-conceived-- but immediately after, the 11-minute ""Wallpaper Sink or Swim"" seems a clear and devestating
    revelation.  After five minutes of its barely-there piano and jutting left-channel samples, a thundering
    melody harkens a new beginning, killing itself on an odd chord before rising again as a dramatic, ascending
    progression.  Hushed jazz drums begin to stutter and fall all over the track as horns, tones and samples
    wander around Fog's constant chant, ""Goats will eat tins cans,"" an apparently meaningless repetition that
    has a surprising function: the lyric is the grounding melody around which an orchestra of instruments
    circle, a moment in which hip-hop's tradition of juxtaposition meets music theory.</p><p>
    
    Fog lays down some skillful, ambitious, and certainly curious foundations on <i>Ether Teeth</i>, but his
    coloring book isn't completely filled in.  But that he's made such a tremendous leap from his amateurish
    if promising debut to this highly developed, emotionally attenuated sound manipulation speaks to his future.
    For its sometimes uneven composition, <i>Ether Teeth</i> brings reality closer to your ears than most music
    ever hope, melding folk, hip-hop and psychedelia to produce a few of the finest tunes you'll hear this year.
    Surprisingly personal and emotionally resonant, <i>Ether Teeth</i> is potent inspiration, undeniably
    captivating in its moments of brilliance.</p></div>"|3130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3130-ether-teeth/|8.4|Amanda Petrusich
