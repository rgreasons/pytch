The producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">Alchemist</a> is from Beverly Hills, but has produced some of gangsta rap's bleakest East Coast rap, for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"" target=""_blank"">Mobb Deep</a> and others. The two of them together makes perfect sense: For them, Queensbridge is a state of mind, a place to visit within the world of records. On <i>My 1st Chemistry Set</i>, they key into that thick atmosphere like a couple of virtuosos.</p>
<p>The obvious out of the way first: Boldy's voice is a dead ringer for Mobb Deep's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30073-prodigy/"" target=""_blank"">Prodigy</a>. The resemblance is so strong it raises hackles the first time he opens his mouth. But like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>, who has ambled past his constant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface</a> comparisons to his own persona, Boldy sneaks a unique sensibility under the cover of a <i>very</i> familiar sound. He's a dead-eyed tough guy, a position that starts at ""unamused"" and goes darker from there, but beneath the pose, his words leap eagerly around, betraying his dirty secret: <i>enthusiasm</i>. ""I used to write raps off of my spelling words, so I could learn<i> </i>the meaning of them and how to spell them,"" he <a href=""http://somanyshrimp.com/2012/01/30/somanyshrimp-boldy-james-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told David Drake</a> back in 2012. ""Because if you use a word in a sentence, and don’t know the meaning, you can use the words around it to get the definition of the word you were looking for."" Respectfully, this isn't the most intimidating sentiment in the world, and it positions Boldy closer to someone like Black Hippy's resident word-nerd <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30353-ab-soul/"" target=""_blank"">Ab-Soul</a>.</p>
<p>On ""Moochie,"" he gives a slang lesson that isn't a lesson at all, but a chance to render you glassy-eyed: ""My dank Mary Jane and my big chain Julie/A deuce is a split, a baby is a stoolie/A kilo is a brick, a quarter is a cutie/If you tellin you a snitch/county is the skidooski."" Got that? On ""Rappies,"" he mutters ""Slow rolling them snow bunnies in Clinton Township/Them bastards trying to give me about sixty/For transacting them Graham crackers of that brown shit"" and the syntax—<i>transacting them Graham crackers of that brown shit—</i>blooms and lingers.  Oh, and he's got a deadpan sense of humor: ""Life is Precious/a fat ugly bitch that'll get you whacked,"" he cracks on ""What's the Word"". On ""Traction,"" he slyly quotes Redman's ""Time 4 Sum Aksion"", and while Boldy isn't exactly a straitjacket-straining wildcard like Red, their rhyme pads could definitely be friends.</p>
<p>Alchemist, for his part, brings his most muted and sensually gloomy side to the project. Boldy has a lot to say, and Alc, though the bigger name of the pair by far, settles back, each beat just present enough to give the exact right cotton-mouth coating to Boldy's verses. ""You Know"" loops a busy bass line and almost nothing else—some wisps of strings, a clipped vocal like a red sock in the dryer. ""Moochie"" is just a shiver of violin tremolos, scratches, and some highly unsettling music-box chimes. The drums don't knock, and in fact barely rise above a cough.</p>
<p>There are guests that breeze through. Freeway continues his murderously intense lap of the mixtape circuit's lower rung; when he raps, it's impossible not to want him to be back on top, at least for that moment. Action Bronson trades bars with Boldy on ""Traction."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl Sweatshirt </a>delivers a thicket of quotables—you need to hear what he does with the rich rhyming possibilities of ""Tan Cressida"", which he lays out and then attacks like a juicy steak. But none of them eclipse Boldy, who makes the most of this opportunity and delivers some of the best verses of his career. He has been steadily deepening, as a writer and rapper, and by now, the lousy emotional weather of QB rap is his own, a personal storm cloud he generates wherever he goes. </p></div>"|18647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18647-boldy-james-the-alchemist-my-1st-chemistry-set/|7.4|Jayson Greene

In that same piece, Toth asserted that Young “made a career of being consistently inconsistent.” That sounds familiar: Grayson Currin noted that “longtime fans of Wooden Wand forsook consistency long ago” when reviewing Toth’s last record under the name Wooden Wand, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17489-blood-oaths-of-the-new-blues/""><i>Blood Oaths of the New Blues</i></a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, and in Brent Sirota’s </span><a href=""http://www.threelobed.com/tlr/tlr093.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">press notes</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> for </span><i>Wooden Wand &amp; the World War IV, </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">he says Toth’s work is so varied that “you might have lost track of Wooden Wand some years back.” It seems Toth has adopted Young’s mercurial approach to writing songs, assembling bands, and releasing records.</span></p>
<p>So it’s ironic that the most Neil Young-sounding album in the Wooden Wand discography comes during one of the most consistent stretches of Toth’s career. He’s worked with the same group for three straight albums—finally giving them a name, The World War IV, on this one—and all three are solid additions to his oeuvre. Actually, <i>Blood Oaths </i>is much more than just solid, one of the best albums of Toth’s career in any guise. <i>Wooden Wand &amp; the World War IV </i>isn’t on that level, but it’s quite good, partially because it picks one tack and sticks with it. In other words, it’s consistent.</p>
<p>That consistency is as about tone as it is about sound. Every track here is comfortably low-key, exuding a calm aura that doesn’t scream for attention–in fact, Toth rarely raises his voice. But he and comrades Dave Hickox and Jody Nelson do raise their guitars at times, locking into ascending solos that expand each track, adding to the casual, unfettered atmosphere. That’s when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5033-neil-young-crazy-horse/"">Neil Young and Crazy Horse</a> echo loudest, in the way that their music often feels as much like loose jams as written songs.</p>
<p>Loose isn’t the best way to describe <i>Wooden Wand &amp; the World War IV</i>, though. Its songs are modest and contained, never feeling like they last too long. But often it seems we’re getting small glimpses of bigger journeys. In fact, Toth wrote only one song fully (the slow, country-ish “Our Father the Monster”) before the album was recorded. The rest grew from riffs written by the World War IV to which Toth added melodies and lyrics. The result feels a bit like what might happen if Young and Crazy Horse sliced up the <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/live-blogging-neil-youngs-37-minute-crazy-horse-jam/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">great jam</a> they posted on their website in early 2012 and rounded the results into individual songs.</p>
<p>The best songs on <i>Wooden Wand &amp; the World War IV </i>combine easy power with an undercurrent of tension. On “Directions to Debbie Harry’s House”, tension comes from the push of Janet Elizabeth Simpson’s bass, as well as the way her accompanying vocals accent Toth’s lead. The urgency of “I Hate the Nightlife” arrives in Toth’s searing mid-song solo, an instant rival to Young’s more fiery forays. There’s even some suspense in the breezy “Complaint Dept."", whose simple swing feels like it could blow in the wind forever. But the more I listen, the more immediate it feels, pushing forward with a vital pulse.</p>
<p>If there’s a drawback to <i>Wooden Wand &amp; the World IV,</i> it’s that the songs take time to sink in, and none are instant classics. For me, that’s a strength: this record isn’t about peaks and valleys but steadiness, and a such there’s not a dull moment to be found. If you’re new to Toth’s work and looking to be quickly blown away, don’t start here. But keep some space open on your shelf, because if you get hooked by any other Wooden Wand record, it’ll likely lead you to <i>Wooden Wand &amp; the World War IV.</i></p></div>"|18741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18741-wooden-wand-the-world-war-iv-wooden-wand-the-world-war-iv/|7.2|Marc Masters

That line is quintessential M.I.A.: artfully provocative, magnificently over-it (""If you don’t give a fuck,"" she declared in a pixelated deadpan on her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14970-vicki-leekx/"">last mixtape</a>, ""Then I don’t give a damn""), and difficult to square with a fact-checker. The Sri-Lankan-born, London-bred artist has hyped <i>Matangi</i> as her ""spiritual album,"" and, sure, there <i>are</i> plenty of references to the titular Hindu goddess and other Eastern-spiritual phenomena throughout its 15 tracks. But contrary to her claims, there are also hints that she’s still paying (somewhat selective) attention to the kind of American music she so brilliantly re-appropriated on her pair of mid-aughts masterpieces,<i> Arular</i> and <i>Kala</i>: There’s a Weeknd sample, at least two different Drake disses, and a handful of tracks produced by Hit-Boy. Let’s also not forget when she <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47402-details-on-upcoming-mia-album-emerge/"">took to Twitter all of 14 months ago</a> to clear up rumors about the already-delayed album, claiming that the finished product would sound like ""Paul Simon on acid.""</p>
<p>Contradictory? Sure—but who cares. The people who treat M.I.A.’s controversial career like a never-ending game of gotcha miss the point; from day one, her contradictions have enlivened her music and saved it from heavy-handed moralizing. A decade after her first mixtape, it now feels safe to call M.I.A. one of the most forward-thinking pop artists of the last decade: She aestheticized deadpan cross-cultural juxtaposition before Tumblr was even a thing, she <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51229-mia-revisits-criticism-of-ys-the-message-in-light-of-nsa-surveillance-revelations/"">predicted</a> the controversy surrounding the N.S.A.’s surveillance program, and professed that a pop star might be more like a fashion designer than a musician back when Kanye West was still <a href=""http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/kanye-west-bear-mascot.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wearing a bear suit</a>. <i>Matangi</i>, then, is a disappointing record not for any reasons having to do with its (or its maker’s) lack of a coherent moral imperative. (""Ain’t no Dalai Lama,"" she shrugs unapologetically on the skronky intro track, ""Karmageddon"".) No, <i>Matangi</i> is a disappointing record because of how listlessly over and ""beyond"" everything it is—to the point that it often feels uncharacteristically weary and out of touch.</p>
<p>M.I.A.’s inability to compromise is, in some ways, what makes her music and attitude so appealing. But in more recent years that very quality has begun to wreak havoc on her recorded output. There was, of course, the fuck-all aural minefield that was her last proper album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14434-y/"">/\/\/\Y/\</a></i>. In light of the N.S.A. revelations, some have attempted to reclaim the album (some of which focused on the then-puzzling claim that ""Google connected to the government"") as an unsung masterpiece—though most people consider it a million-and-a-half-dollar middle finger towards the new fans who hopped aboard after M.I.A.’s accidental smash hit ""Paper Planes"". <i>Matangi</i> is not as abrasive or hook-averse as its predecessor, but it seems to have suffered because of her combative relationship with her label, Interscope. Initially slated for release in December of last year, M.I.A. and the label butted heads (they allegedly thought the material was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49054-mias-matangi-postponed-to-april-due-to-excess-of-positivity/"">“too positive”</a>); it seems they only agreed on a release date when she threatened to leak the album on Twitter. In the meantime, much of this material seems to have sat on the shelf, growing staler by the month.</p>
<p>This is most glaring on ""YALA"" (""you always live again""), an ode to reincarnation (and also: pole-dancing) that flies in the face of the youth-cult of YOLO. ""If you only live once,"" she muses in a stoner-voiced spoken word towards the end of the song, ""Why do we keep doing the same shit? Back home, where I come from, we keep being born again and again."" Fair enough, but ""YALA"" barks harder than it actually bites. The fact that its chorus is peppered with chants of ""YOLO"" makes it feel like it’s trying to have it both ways—an anti-YOLO song that can also slyly ride the phrase’s cultural coattails. (And maybe it would have, had that train not left the station at least a year ago now.) Much of <i>Matangi</i>’s sensibility feels similarly dated, limp, or just plain perplexing: There’s a decade-too-late Lara Croft line, another Drake diss on the riotous title track feels too vague (""Started from the bottom/ But Drake gets all the credit"") to warrant a response, and then a moment when she calls out—and here the beat drops out like she’s about to say something seriously scathing—Julianne Moore…?</p>
<p><i>Matangi</i>’s promised focus on ""spirituality"", too, often feels thin, avoiding most attempts at depth in favor of gauche puns (""Karmageddon"") and easy rhymes like, ""If you’re gonna be me you need a manifesto/ If you ain’t got one you better get one presto."" That last line is from ""Matangi"", whose Switch-produced beat enlivens the proceedings a bit, though it does feel like a re-tread (#YALA?) of <i>Kala</i>’s hyperkinetic standout ""Bird Flu"". A much lower moment, though, is ""Sexodus"", a cardboard-stiff booty jam that repurposes the Weeknd’s ""Lonely Star"". The sample doesn’t add much to the pulseless track, but Abel Tesfaye should be grateful: By comparison, ""Kiss Land"" now sounds like a downright <i>sexy</i> thing to call a song.</p>
<p>Ultimately, some of these beats do redeem <i>Matangi</i>. Though marred by snoozy rapping (""I’m so tangy people call me Matangi""), ""Bring the Noize"" is a sensory-overloaded throwback to the best of <i>Arular</i>, and ""Only 1 U"" (which Maya herself co-produced) is a playfully clanging, chopped-and-screwed mosaic of bells and whistles. Towering high above the rest of the material, though, is the near-perfect early-2012 single ""Bad Girls"", which, nearly two years and infinite plays later, still feels fresh as the first time you heard it. When it appears on <i>Matangi</i>, though, it just feels like a tease of what this record could have been, had its vision been a little less cluttered and vague. As plenty of critics pointed out when <i>/\/\/\Y/\</i> was released, M.I.A. is at her most radical when she’s participating in rather than fleeing from the pop world—all the better to stand as a stark (if forgivably flawed) presence laughing at its hypocrisies. After all, ""Bad Girls"" was so undeniable that a <i><a href=""http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-diamonds-from-sierra-leone-remix-lyrics#note-17918"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">business, man</a></i> referenced it in a song he released through a Samsung advertisement disguised as a mobile phone app that was later <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/17/jay-z-samsung-app-investigation-privacy-violations_n_3610221.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">investigated for violating its users’ privacy</a>. M.I.A., no doubt, would appreciate the irony—and, if she were channeling her disses with more laser focus, be uniquely qualified to point it out.</p>
<p><i>Matangi</i> is not without charms, but unlike her most potent releases it sounds less interested in pushing and prodding the culture forward and more content to soar safely above it. ""There is nothing that can touch me now,"" she sings on the nursery-rhyme earworm ""Come Walk With Me”. It’s one of the only moments she feels like she’s actually channeling Matangi—she sounds blissfully free, superhumanly defiant, and 5,000 feet above it all. Is it selfish to say it’s a shame? We could use her down here.</p></div>"|18701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18701-mia-matangi/|6.5|Lindsay Zoladz

With its creepy cover, jarring beats and frequently sinister content, it was, in the true spirit of the holiday, a release engineered to be scary. And let's not forget how scary OFWGKTA were. Coming in the wake of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator</a>'s unhinged, slur-laden <i>Bastard</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>'s rape-and-murder-filled Earl, right as Odd Future was beginning to generate serious buzz, <i>BLACKENEDWHITE</i> was the three's-a-trend release that confirmed the image of the collective as violent sociopaths, relentless teenage pranksters and provocative game-changers. There was both genuine fascination and serious concern about the ways Odd Future might upend the status quo. On a more basic level, MellowHype was just all about the idea of Halloween: When they weren't busy making their own homemade horror movie soundtracks, they were the guys outside hip-hop's comfortably fun party who were having even more fun egging the house.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This Halloween, MellowHype members Hodgy Beats and Left Brain are no longer out smashing mailboxes or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWMOEVdXR2o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dressing up like corpses</a>, but rather inside, smoking weed and wearing 90s rapper costumes with their friend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">Domo Genesis</a> as part of the trio MellowHigh. The scariest thing about the group's self-titled album isn't the subject matter, which, even at its most provocative, is basically boilerplate shit-talking, nor is it the jarring beats, which are too crisply mastered to suggest any real threat. Instead, it's a sort of a deeper dread, the kind that sinks in after a couple of Halloweens spent lazily wearing the same ""soccer player"" or ""businessman"" costume, when you realize that your ways of doing things that are supposed to be fun have become totally mundane. MellowHigh is not disorienting but rather frighteningly familiar.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The issue, in a lot of ways, is that the people involved have gotten better at making music. Domo has sharpened his focus since his early days as Odd Future's jovial, lackadaisical stoner, and recent releases—particularly Earl's </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18380-earl-sweatshirt-doris/"" target=""_blank"">Doris</a>—</i><span> have seen him staking out a role as the group's go-to guy for accomplished, rapidly delivered verses. Hodgy, too, has matured as a rapper, playing with more complex rhyme schemes and growing more comfortable on Left Brain's increasingly challenging production. With a few years of added practice and improved recording resources, MellowHigh's members have figured out how to consistently deliver, but they've also lost the edge of unpredictability that made a release like </span><span><i>BLACKENEDWHITE</i> </span><span>so compelling. That album's rougher mixes and scattershot approach to rapping felt like a group clamoring for attention and making the best of what they had; </span><span>MellowHigh </span><span>is the work of people who know they have their audience's attention doing their best to make more or less what's expected of them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A few years ago, these would have been the guys making fun of a group making hashtag rhymes like ""I'm all about they wives/Stepford"" and dropping a lightly Auto-Tuned hook with the phrase ""this real shit is going out of style"" in it. Now, they're the ones doing it. When Tyler and Earl offer their wacky, charismatic guest verses, it's particularly clear who would be considered OF royalty at this point. Conversely, when journeyman stoner rappers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31027-smoke-dza/"" target=""_blank"">Smoke DZA</a> stop by for a joint torch-passing moment on ""HighLife"", they seem a bit like Ghosts of Rap Careers Yet to Come, reminders that there's a safe, well-established lane for lyrically proficient dudes who like talking about weed and are willing to tour a lot.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That's not to give off the impression that MellowHigh is complacent, or even particularly conventional. Compared to MellowHype's monotonous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17119-numbers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Numbers</i></a>, <i>MellowHigh</i> is an improvement, a show of good faith that Odd Future isn't quite content to settle into rote lyrical recitations and cash in on their lucrative side business selling socks. For one thing, the group takes on the challenge of singing some hooks, particularly on the single ""Yu"", a prickly G-funk foray with a beat full of minimal piano stabs, and the frenetic ""Get'n Drunk,"" which sees Hodgy Beats taking on the role of a more ratchet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/"" target=""_blank"">Kid Cudi</a>. Meanwhile, crunk anthem ""Roofless"" fits perfectly alongside MellowHype's other moshpit bangers, a wholly appropriate subgenre experiment. The debt to 90s influences is clear—the entertaining castoff ""Cigarillo"" explicitly suggests ""we should do that Master P shit, where he does all those conversations on at the same time""—but the net is wide, and familiar echoes of East Coast lyricists or groups like Tha Dogg Pound and Three 6 Mafia interact in unexpected ways with Left Brain's consistently abrasive production.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A master of screaming, repellant synths on this album, Left Brain has shifted his sound from low-budget noir to blockbuster dystopian thriller, and he particularly excels on tracks like the looming ""Air"" and the climactic ""Cold World"". Elsewhere, the heaving bass line on ""Troublesome"" makes the whole thing sound like it's happening in a boiler room, and ""Extinguisher"" uses a sample of an actual scream and thunderous drums to elevate it well above standard boom-bap fare. These beats are huge, intimidating walls of sound. They could use more imposing rappers to stand up to them. It may be that surprising people is a young man's game, and it's time for Domo Genesis and Hodgy Beats to settle into their comfortable roles as confident, reliable spitters. But for an album that sounds as off-the-wall as </span><i>MellowHigh</i><span>, it feels like a bit of a cop out to be content with insubstantial rapping. </span></p></div>"|18708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18708-mellowhigh-mellowhigh/|6.8|Kyle Kramer

It may be Bloomberg’s shiny technotopian New York that Ferraro’s portraying, but he renders it in the grimy grey-on-grey palette of the city’s gutted-out Seventies, an eternal night time of dirty concrete and menacing shadows like something out of an Abel Ferrara movie. Ferraro’s one of the leading figures in a successful movement to establish for contemporary R&amp;B the same kind of avant-garde movement that other pop styles like rock and rap have had for years. The movement’s most popular member is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>, and although Ferraro’s past work has been more aggressively experimental, and boasted a heavier house music influence, they were at least in the same general orbit together. <i>NYC, Hell 3:00 AM</i> feels like he’s slipped from that orbit completely and crash landed face down in a gutter.</p>
<p>It’s a bleak album that totally inverts the druggy nocturnal glamour that’s become avant-R&amp;B’s default mode. While it faithfully recreates the feeling of being chemically imbalanced late at night, it’s not the fun kind. The compositions are harshly minimalist, skeletal assemblages of beats that feel like half the drums are missing, distended keyboard parts fading in and out like something in a fever dream, and overblown field recordings of police scanners and traffic noise, just in case your anxiety wasn’t already elevated enough already. It’s not the fashionable, tastefully arranged kind of minimalism that’s currently de rigueur with tastemaking electronic musicians, but rather something sickly and enervated, like the songs once had more parts and a more robust sound but have somehow been starved down to their current states.</p>
<p>The tracks tend towards abstraction, and at a few points the album seems to lose any sort interest in rhythm and melody, relying instead on mood and texture alone. Other times they’ll cohere into something that’s more or less identifiable as an R&amp;B song (“Close Ups” and “Cheek Bones"", which sound glamorous but aren’t), and even then the bare sketches of melody take a back seat to establishing a smoggy atmosphere. The whole thing feels like it’s coated in a layer of greasy, digitally simulated dirt. Here and there Ferraro adds his own vocals, mumbled beyond comprehensibility, always a little off-key and sleep-deprived, and touched with just enough modulation effects to sound like the recording’s physically warped.</p>
<p>If <i>NYC, Hell 3:00 AM</i> sounds like an unpleasant listen, that’s because, on some levels, it is. Ferraro has some of a noise musician’s combatively challenging nature, and at times seems to be going out of his way to unsettle his listeners. (Sometimes a little too far, like when he tries to evoke the psychic stress of living in the city by literally sampling 9/11 news broadcasts.) The thing is that much of it this unpleasantness just adds to the fascination. It helps the record succeed as a verite-tinged portrait of life in New York City, or at least one aspect of it that doesn’t often make it into movies these days. It also helps it to create another type of portrait, one of the most vividly true to life depictions of serious depression that’s ever been recorded. Stripping R&amp;B of its ability to inspire pleasure turns out to be the perfect pop music metaphor for the crippling anhedonia that’s part and parcel of the severe depressive experience—a sensual form with its sensuality drained away, transformed into something ugly and oppressive.</p>
<p>The fact that Ferraro’s able to work in an R&amp;B medium using ugliness as his primary aesthetic says a lot about how real the style’s avant garde is, and about how far they’re willing to push things. It also says a lot about how good things can get if they keep pushing. <i>NYC, Hell 3:00 AM</i> isn’t going to be your thing if you’re on the hunt for the next edgy crooner about to blow up—you’re only going to hear it in DJ sets if the DJ is extremely brave or suicidal or both. But if what you’re looking for is an experience, one that can offer something extremely rare and powerful, if not exactly fun, then this is it.</p></div>"|18709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18709-james-ferraro-nyc-hell-300-am/|6.6|Miles Raymer

To <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29704-widowspeak/"">Widowspeak</a>, these artifacts represent the hazy, lazy birthplace of swamp rock and Delta blues, which singer Molly Hamilton and multi-instrumentalist Robert Earl Thomas fell in love with last year after touring their sophomore LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17551-almanac/""><i>Almanac</i></a> across the American Southeast. The duo incorporated these sights, sounds, and smoke into a six-note guitar riff they had been sitting on for awhile. That became the motif for <i>The Swamps</i>, a stopgap EP between Widowspeak’s last full-length and their next one. After hopscotching across the country from the Pacific Northwest and Chicago to Brooklyn and exploring that wanderlust in <i>Almanac</i>, Widowspeak have settled on a thematically consistent aesthetic that suits them.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15716-widowspeak-true-believer/"">“True Believer”</a> is the first song Widowspeak recorded for <i>The Swamps</i>, and fittingly it’s the one that sounds closest to <i>Almanac.</i> (Thomas <a href=""http://chunkyglasses.com/content/interview-robert-earl-thomas-of-widowspeak.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has said</a> this EP, which Kevin McMahon also produced, leans more toward Widowspeak’s last record than their putative third LP). It opens much like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-5BBADOBAc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Locusts”</a>, with a similarly note-bent but lower-pitched bloom from Thomas’ Fender Telecaster. Where the latter track was tightly coiled like a tense calm before the plague, on “True Believer” Hamilton literally lets her hair down (“tangled sheets, tangled hair”) and swoons into the romanticized slide guitar. The religious imagery on <i>Almanac</i>’s “Dyed in the Wool” can also be found in ""True Believer""–“speak in tongues,” “shake off that devil fever,” “pilgrim lips”–but this time Hamilton tinges her turns of phrase with the vivid mysticism of the South’s voodoo culture rather than falling back on idiomatic poetry in the vein of “cut from the cloth.""</p>
<p>Hamilton’s lyrics “The house was a good one, but the yard was overgrown” on “Calico” are actually a good metaphor for <i>Almanac</i>, a fine record that still occasionally got lost on its forays into Western and Latin themes. Most of <i>The Swamps</i>, by contrast, rides on opening instrumental “Theme From the Swamps”, obviously a kind of mission statement for the EP. Those six creaky, twangy, back-porch rocking-chair notes prove to be a tangible yet versatile anchor for Widowspeak’s songwriting. This time, most of the genre-specific accents–the castanet rolls on “Smoke and Mirrors”, shakers rattling in the background of “The Swamps”, tambourines stalking through “Calico” like spurs on a cowboy boot–enhance what’s already there instead of distracting from it. The only weak spot on <i>The Swamps</i> might be “Brass Bed”, a lovely track that suffers from simply too much going on–multi-part harmonies, twinkling pianos, and “That’s Amore”-esque guitar stylings, and awkward lyrical syntax (“Find me underneath the linen/ Trying hard to get forgiven”).</p>
<p>Widowspeak do their best work when they take a minute to smell the sage, not necessarily when they forge ahead into new territories; and to a certain extent the band recognizes this and embraces it on <i>The Swamps</i>. In a recent interview, Thomas suggested that <i>Almanac</i>, with its big, brassy arrangements and relatively quick tempos, was an exercise in nostalgia “backlash” while their latest collection of songs takes the opposite tack. “You can’t be too nostalgic, you can’t get caught in something like that,” he said, referring to the former. “In the swamps, you feel sticky, and slowed down, and caught. And in terms of our music, we’re never like a really fast, loud band.” He’s right: Hamilton’s languorous croon will never be able to fully escape Hope Sandoval’s shadow–nor should she try–and Thomas’ arrangements will probably always owe a fair piece to the 60s' gun-slinging theme songs of the Wild West, which have been the band's bread and butter since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15735-widowspeak/""><i>Widowspeak</i></a>'s album cover re-imagined the giant spiders from <i>Wild Wild West</i>. Widowspeak seem to have found a home in the swamps, and now they're inviting us in to set awhile. </p></div>"|18688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18688-widowspeak-the-swamps/|7.4|Harley Brown

Despite making her music alone at home, Kinuko Hiramatsu’s solo project developed within a like-minded community of bedroom producers that emerged in Japan’s capital starting in 2009. Revolving around the <a href=""http://cuzmepain.com/TOP.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cuz Me Pain</a> record label, outfits like Jesse Ruins (briefly signed to Captured Tracks), Faron Square, and the Beauty created songs inspired by the house music playing in the popular clubs in Shibuya, but with a level of intimacy and longing appropriate for artists operating mostly alone in their apartments. </p>
<p>Sapphire Slows existed within and learned from this scene, and her debut full-length album, <i>Allegoria, </i>wonderfully captures the shadowy essence of this corner of Tokyo music. The 10 tracks here are minimal dance numbers featuring beats that could slide into many DJ sets, but they're undercut with an uneasiness provided by Hiramatsu’s wispy vocals. This style isn’t unique to Sapphire Slows or the various Japanese artists she’s tied to sonically—a visit to one of Cuz Me Pain’s DJ nights often include tracks from similarly skeletal outfits like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29362-solar-bears/"" target=""_blank"">Solar Bears</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29673-miracles-club/"" target=""_blank"">Miracles Club</a>, and nearly everyone on Los Angeles label Not Not Fun, who released <i>Allegoria</i>. Yet what she does so well here is balance floor-filling sounds with the hair-raising atmosphere.</p>
<p>Hiramatsu pulls this off so well thanks to her vocals. She mixes them low into <i>Allegoria's</i> tracks so her singing becomes a ghostly whisper that’s often unintelligible. Words sometimes emerge clearly from the ether, like on the Morse-code-like-beeping “Rules,” while other times she’s content singing only syllables like on “Fade Out.” But the overall effect of her voice registers the same either way—Hiramatsu is more interested in delivering a particular texture rather than saying anything concrete.</p>
<p>This steadfast sonic devotion has hurt Sapphire Slows’ previous EPs and singles compilations – her dark take on dance music is intriguing, but a whole disc of it can go from mysterious to tedious. For <i>Allegoria</i>, Hiramatsu has balanced out all the creepiness with some of her most playful recordings to date. Opener “Dry Fruits” shuffles ahead on bass and vocals familiar to her work, but also features a bright synth at its center and some party-starting percussion deeper in the mix. “Third Party” practically vamps, Hiramatsu’s singing sounding relaxed. The sequencing of these songs is a bit off—they are the first two songs on <i>Allegoria</i>, and one of them would serve better as a break during the album’s more sinister core—but they do add some variety to Sapphire Slows’ sound.</p>
<p>The bulk of her debut album, though, remains shivery. The back end of this album is especially memorable, as Hiramatsu has learned to grace her music with a gripping sense of drama. “As You Know” starts out sounding like anything else in her catalog, but then Hiramatsu pushes her voice into new direction, singing higher and stretching out words long than she has before. It makes the music resonate emotionally more. “Can I Get Out of This Silence” embraces minimalism, letting her lungful vocals stick out more than usual, only rippling synths and forceful drums cutting through them. The title track ends the album on an especially strong note, as Hiramatsu once again expands her vocal delivery as the music around her subtly morphs for six minutes, every bit of it captivating.    </p>
<p><i>Allegoria </i>is a strong entry point into Sapphire Slows’ music and a varied enough recording to never really become a chore, even if several songs seems content to coast on her formula. But Hiramatsu’s first proper album is also important because it is a strong representation of what a particular Tokyo music community has been playing around with for several years now. Alongside Jesse Ruins’ singles collection <i>Dream Analysis</i>, <i>Allegoria </i>is an excellent distillation of this in-the-shadows scene. </p></div>"|18657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18657-sapphire-slows-allegoria/|7.0|Patrick St. Michel

Nor did they ever sound like a band that needed a serotonin boost. Yet, even “Lights &amp; Music”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12091-need-you-now/"">“Need You Now”</a>, “Hearts on Fire”, “Take Me Over” and just about any of the Australian quartet’s uniformly excellent and directly-titled singles can sound wishy-washy and kinda dark in the face of <i>Free Your Mind</i>, its Successories screen-saver album cover and Dan Whitford’s claim that the title refers to a freedom that’s “universally positive and timeless.”  Maybe Cut Copy were hippies all along, and whether you think that’s progress or a serious regression, <i>Free Your Mind </i>is at least a sensible continuation of their trajectory from the cosmopolitan, club-friendly and DFA-affiliated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11407-in-ghost-colours/""><i>In Ghost Colours </i></a>to the breezier, more festival-ready 80s pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15055-zonoscope/""><i>Zonoscope</i></a>.  But there’s a difference between freeing your mind, losing your mind and just flat-out shutting it down. And you just wish Cut Copy left even <i>something</i> to the imagination, as their most overtly fun and least dynamic music restates the obvious over and over again throughout <i>Free Your Mind</i>.</p>
<p>Their aims are admirable here. Whitford claimed the band took their inspiration from the Summers of Love, both 1967 and 1989. Philosophically and sonically, those years are something of a package deal anyway—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12208-the-stone-roses"">Stone Roses</a> and Inspiral Carpets were essentially psychedelic pop-rock bands with beats, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream"">Primal Scream</a> and Happy Mondays had no qualms about straight-up pilfering the era. You can’t doubt Cut Copy’s commitment to sidling up with nu-Madchester types like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31037-jagwar-ma/"">Jagwar Ma</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9681-paradise"">Paradise</a>, as there’s barely any modernist touch to be found on the title track, just all of your favorite E’s and wizz signifiers, sorted out neatly: staggered house piano vamps, endlessly thumping bass drum and Whitford letting his vocals get all baggy in every sense of the word, an amalgamation of Shaun Ryder’s dysfunctional relationship with pitch, Ian Brown’s bedheaded proclamations and Bobby Gillespie’s revolutionary hokum.</p>
<p>In about five minutes, you hear everything <i>new</i> Cut Copy has to offer, though they stay true to their strange nostalgia for the future by slipping inside the proverbial acid house on “Let Me Show You Love” and all but sampling Stone Roses’ “Don’t Stop” on “Take Me Higher"". There are enough highlights to still make their ecstatic live shows a must-see; “Walking in the Sky” is stately flower-child pop while “We Are Explorers” reaches the hands-in-the-air mania as effectively as their previous singles. But with its timbale breakdown, a chorus melody with sharp contours rather than flabby curves, it’s just a reminder of what you're missing out on here.</p>
<p><i>Free Your Mind</i> has a personality, at least. It’s a concept album of sorts, taking you out of the desert (Coachella’s EDM-friendly Sahara Tent?), above the city and... something about the waves. You wouldn’t think they’d have much more to say about holistic healing and solar-religiosity after ending <i>Zonoscope</i> with a 15-minute song named “Sun God"", and they don’t really, though it doesn’t stop them from trying—the lyrical component of <i>Free Your Mind</i> is straight <i>Screamadelica</i> magnet poetry about us getting higher/shining brighter than the sun and getting free and getting loaded. And while Whitford’s slack affectations are pitch-perfect on “Free Your Mind”, elsewhere the same effect just means he’s singing off key, capturing the tone of his influences, but lacking the necessary rock-star posturing.</p>
<p>If this seems like an unusual amount of focus on Cut Copy’s lyrics, it’s because the music itself seems content to keep the beat and little else. Though it’s every bit as sequentially-formatted as <i>In Ghost Colours</i> or <i>Zonoscope</i>, F<i>ree Your Mind</i> lacks the dynamism of its predecessors, the DJ-curated ebb and flow. You can laugh at the ridiculous spoken word interludes, but they’re about the only thing that can jar you out of the mid-album lull created as <i>Free Your Mind</i> goes forward. With few exceptions, it’s basically a Cut Copy album that’s just deep cuts—you get the same octave-jumping funk basslines (“In Memory Capsule”), the occasional acoustic-laced pop-rock (“Dark Corners &amp; Mountain Tops”) and slow-moving disco-pop from their past records, only with lumpier melodies and Dave Fridmann’s mixing job using reverb like packing peanuts to make <i>Free Your Mind</i> sound both puffy and stiff.</p>
<p>Cut Copy’s music has always been simple; the difficult part was trying to explain in non-illusory terms what made <i>Bright Like Neon Love</i>, <i>In Ghost Colours</i> and <i>Zonoscope</i> glorious and uplifting rather than silly or even flat out dumb. My take is that they had omnivorous enough taste to show they take their craft seriously, while avoiding crowd-moving mock profundity and proving they don’t take <i>themselves</i> all that serious. <i>Free Your Mind </i>manages to be Cut Copy's most homogenous and it's most ""message-based"" record yet, and in doing little other than turning on, tuning in and dropping out, there’s precious little separating it from the vapid electro-pop to which Cut Copy used to be an alternative.</p></div>"|18689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18689-cut-copy-free-your-mind/|6.4|Ian Cohen

In the late-1990s, as Y2K-bug experts/fear-mongers started hitting the talk-show circuit to warn us of the impending global technological meltdown, the Beta Band brought with them the reassurance that we’d still be able to get out of our heads even in the event of a worldwide blackout. In stark contrast to the bloated Britpop dominating their homeland at the time, the Beta Band crafted majestic music out of the most modest means: mantric psych-folk anthems built atop a jew’s-harp drone and bongo bounce (“She’s the One”); drum-circle workouts (“B+A”) that hit hard enough to leave fissures in the earth’s crust; a cappella beat-boxed, bell-clanging chants that could make a quiet night around the campfire feel like peak-hour at the Hacienda (“The House Song”).</p>
<p>These epochal early recordings—as heard on the <i>Champion Versions</i>, <i>Patty Patty Sound</i>, and <i>Los Amigos del Betas Bandidos</i> EPs—imagined the <i>White Album</i> as recorded at Black Ark: music of the ancients that sounded as though it was beaming in through radio transmissions from another galaxy. Though not without kindred spirits—from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a>’s stoner-folk freakery to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/833-cornershop/"" target=""_blank"">Cornershop</a>’s pan-cultural polyglot—the Betas more acutely symbolized an act of a retreat: from camera-mugging music-press ass-kissery, from suffocating urbanism, from accelerated modernity. They never came close to topping the charts (unless you count <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppJAkN4m9bY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the in-store one at Championship Vinyl</a>), but they had a profound effect on bands that did: in their wake, Radiohead <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAF8D0ugyVk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">turned more insular</a>, Oasis <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI7NhSoGUkU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">got trippier</a>, and even Travis started <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Travis_-_The_Man_Who_album_cover.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">booking photo shoots out in the sticks</a>. To this day, after more than a decade of familiarization and canonization, listening to these early EPs still feels like unearthing some lost artifact whose place and date of origin are difficult to decode.</p>
<p>Those extended players were released in limited editions over the course of 1997 and early 1998, but they locked together into a perfect full-length album sequence when reissued in September 98 as <i>The Three EPs</i> compilation. Now, <i>The Regal Years</i> attempts a similar, if more difficult trick: combining the band’s entire recorded output into a seamless, six-disc listening experience. It’s especially challenging because, over the course of their seven-year existence, the Beta Band were not a band that enjoyed a linear evolution from one album to next. Rather, each of their official albums stand as discrete, often oppositional units, shaped by the particular pressures weighing down on the band at the time. </p>
<p>Most notorious of all is the Beta Band’s self-titled 1999 effort, which deflated the ballooning expectations surrounding the group in the wake of <i>The Three EPs</i> with all the elegance and subtlety of a whoopee cushion. In place of its predecessors’ melting-pot fusion of cross-genre influences, <i>The Beta Band</i> pits them at war with one another, stopping the hypnotic space-rock groove of “It’s Not Too Beautiful” dead in its tracks with a destablizing orchestral sample from John Barry’s <i>Black Hole</i> soundtrack, or fashioning a “Beta Band Rap” that’s actually equal parts barbershop-quartet serenade, proto-“<a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xppd5_snl-lazy-sunday_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lazy Sunday</a>” faux b-boy braggadocio, and Elvis pelvis thrusts. Over its four-and-a-half minutes, the latter song sees the Beta Band turn into the Meta Band, unraveling two years of carefully cultivated mystique by recounting in painstaking detail the band’s origin story to date, right down to commentary on the free dinners paid for by the Parlophone A&amp;R reps trying to sign them. (""A meal like that, yo/ We never ate!"")</p>
<p>That’s just one of many gestures on <i>The Beta Band</i> that blurs the line between being genuinely weird and quote-unquote “wacky,” from the endless chipmunked funk of “Smiling” to the electro-square-dance pastiche “Dance O’er the Border”. “I’m at 90 degrees to the rest of the world,” Steve Mason sings on the charming country-rock ramble, “Round the Bend”, an all-too-accurate advertisement for a record that packs all the hair-pulling complication of a geometry exam. Mason’s actual assessment of <i>The Beta Band</i> was far less subtle; just prior to its release, citing budgetary and deadline pressures, he infamously told the press the album “was fucking awful—the worst album released this year.” But if the record violently vascillates between fascinating and frustrating on a song-by-song basis, its over-arching oddness retains its own peculiar allure. At the very least, <i>The Beta Band</i> stands as a time capsule of possibly the last instance when a group this strange could not just get signed to a major label, but use the company dime to make themselves sound even stranger. (And this is to say nothing of the complementary disc of ambient field recordings that were included in press mail-outs of <i>The Beta Band</i>, but eventually scrapped from the official release.)</p>
<p>The Beta Band never quite recovered their momentum after the self-titled-album stumble. Though they would harness the shambolic qualities of their recordings into a tight and powerful live act (earning them tour invites from Radiohead), their subsequent albums were refined to a fault. It was easy to underrate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/669-hot-shots-ii/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hot Shots II</i></a> at the time of its 2001 release: siphoning off the skeletal, breakbeat skitter and moody atmospherics of <i>The Beta Band</i>’s Bonnie Tyler-quoting highlight “The Hard One”, the album mostly lacked the exuberant eccentricity and percussive grooves of the Betas’ signature works, and proved wholly out of step with popular UK tastes that were shifting toward the more visceral retro-rock pleasures of t<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">he Strokes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"" target=""_blank"">the White Stripes</a>. (Not to mention the fact that trip-hoppy lead single “Squares” leans on a string sample that felt like an eight-years-too-late echo of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a>’s “Glory Box”.) But the passage of time has been very kind to this record, which now feels remarkably prescient in initiating a conversation between left-field rock and modern R&amp;B that still continues to this day. And standouts like “Al Sharp” and “Eclipse” presented golden opportunities to showcase the fortitude of Mason’s songwriting in less cluttered surroundings, pointing the way to the intimacty and immediacy of his post-Betas solo records. </p>
<p>Alas, <i>Hot Shots II</i> did little to reverse the group’s waning popularity and diminishing critical cachet, a circumstance alluded to in the self-deprecating title of 2004’s <i>Heroes to Zeros</i>. But The Beta Band hardly sound defeated here. Of all the stylistic guises the Betas had toyed with over the years, straight-up, riff-driven rock was never one of them, and yet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/671-heroes-to-zeros/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heroes to Zeros</i> </a>evinces a heretofore unleashed arena-conquering bravado and clarity—most audible in the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv51LO7NOTo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red Rocks-toppling</a> surge of “Assessment” and the massive Madchester-schooled swing of “Out-Side”—without tempering the band’s idiosyncratic essence. Of course, it figures that, for a group with as troubled a track record as theirs, the Beta Band’s most outwardly accessible effort would prove to be their least successful, the last straw that would lead to their unceremonious break-up in December 2004.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Regal to capitalize on the headlines generated by group’s sudden demise—a career-spanning compilation, <i>The Best of The Beta Band</i>, appeared in 2005 as both an epitaph and a catalyst for post-mortem reappraisal. However, now that Mason has established a steady solo career (following a prolonged period of depression in the wake of the Betas’ split), enough time has passed to reapproach the group's work with fresh ears. And while a six-CD box set may seem forbidding to all but the most hardcore fans (who likely still have all of these albums close at hand), <i>The Regal Years</i> arrives with both a very reasonable price point ($<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Regal-Years-1977-Beta-Band/dp/B00E99RSH6"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">42.99</a>—not much more than what I paid for <i>The Three EPs</i> on import back in the day) and a wealth of bonus material. Comprising key transitory non-album singles (like 2000’s <i>Hot Shots II</i> precursor “To You Alone”/“Sequinsizer”), B-sides, demos, radio sessions, and concert recordings, these add-ons—two discs’ worth—will be equally revelatory to long-time enthusiasts and tourists alike. </p>
<p>Despite the disjointed, reactive nature of their discography, the Beta Band’s albums were united by the fact that none of them represented an absolute finished product; rather, their songs were like living organisms that could assume radically altered shapes under different conditions, be it a BBC appearance or a T in the Park gig before a crowd of thousands. A 1997 visit to Radio 1 shows this policy of impermanence in full effect from day one—where “B+A” gets distended into the sort of brown-note funk jam <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"" target=""_blank"">the Beasties Boys</a> would throw down with Money Mark, the once-imposing 15-minute Floydian dub collage “The Monolith” is sculpted into a much more immediate five-minute piece that unearths the melody lurking within its Pompeii-scaled expanse. And this exploratory impulse remained in place until the band’s final show at London’s Shepherd’s Bush Empire, which is represented here by six tracks, including an adrenalized “Dr. Baker” and a rendition of “The House Song” that climaxes with a drum-set-crashing duel. (The full concert was featured as a bonus disc in <i>The Best of the Beta Band</i>.) But even more impressive is how deep cuts from the less-illumated corners of the catalogue are transformed into show-stopping knockouts, like the rebirth of <i>The Beta Band</i>’s acoustic trance “Broken Up a Ding Dong” as a synth-buzzed motorik odyssey, or a version of the <i>Hot Shots II</i> stomper “Quiet” that gets loosened into a piano-rolled mambo, or an unplugged strip-down of <i>Heroes to Zeroes</i>’ “Out-Side” that shirks the original’s playful go-go-dancer sway to expose the white-knuckled tension at the song’s core. In this regard, <i>The Regal Years</i> does a thorough job of not just compiling the Beta Band's recorded legacy, but underscoring the real reason why they're missed—it’s not just for the music they left behind, but for the infinite possibilities within it that had yet to be explored.</p></div>"|18603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18603-the-beta-band-the-regal-years-1997-2004/|8.4|Stuart Berman

Ripping through 12 hook-heavy songs in 28 minutes, with Allison Crutchfield at the mic most of the time, the quartet emerged boldly, confronting the unattractive realities of their unsteady adulthood in rebellious tempos, battling it with calls for jubilant bodily motion and youthfully existential shout-alongs. That first record sublimated their discontent into its own defiant salve: dissatisfaction expressed satisfyingly.</p>
<p>The second time around, on <i>Surfing Strange</i>, that jubilation is almost gone, though the foursome's restlessness still persists. But now it's expanding, to encompass sentiment along with style, too. Their disillusionment feels bleaker here, refocusing on more interpersonal subjects like dissolving relationships and miscommunications; the musical expression of those intimacies has slowed and thickened to accommodate a more square-shouldered approach. ""Dust in the Gold Sack"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16033-swearin-watered-down/"">""Watered Down""</a>, the pair of opening numbers, set the album's crumbly, emotionally decaying tone. At 4:18, the next song, ""Mermaid"", is the longest the band has ever released; it's also at once their most aggressive and subtle, a mixed style that they wear well, even if it does rely heavily on forbears to accomplish it (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"" target=""_blank"">the Breeders</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a> are two of their most obvious reference points).</p>
<p>The gang does bring back a number of their strong suits, like arranging vivid settings (""Gold Sack"" is great for these, as Crutchfield gazes at ""cracks in the ceiling/ Above us"" and traverses on Brooklyn streets ""Back and forth down Bedford and Nostrand/ You set things in motion"") and setting themselves apart from their peers (""Parts of Speech"" could be a biting condemnation of a ratings-obsessed contemporary: ""Convoluted you are/ Guarded in fear on the radio/ It's no wonder/ when you just measure things in numbers""). So don't worry, these are still your good friends Swearin', they've just become a bit more consumed with their problems. And, for now, it's a good thing.</p>
<p>While much of the press surrounding <i>Surfing</i>'s<i> </i>predecessor<i> </i>translated its Crutchfield-heavy sound as part of a larger narrative about the musical split between Allison and her twin sister Katie (the singer-songwriter behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee/"">Waxahatchee</a>), this sophomore effort<i> </i>pointedly democratizes, in both form and function. Guitarist Kyle Gilbride and bassist Keith Spencer (especially Spencer, who sings lead for the first time on ""Melanoma"" and ""Glare of the Sun"") make their songwriting presence known by sharing vocal duties more evenly with Crutchfield, establishing the rule that ""if you write it, you sing it."" The choice decentralizes (and perhaps dashes somewhat) the expectations Swearin' fans might have had thanks to the female-fronted promise of the first record, but the delegated duties play as more honest to the group's reason for being: they work through personal snags simultaneously and together, not at the pleasure of a frontperson.</p>
<p>There isn't much explicit growth on the record, but where it does express itself is in the development of the players' technical skills. Drummer Jeff Bolt's style hasn't really changed across the two albums, but in this new context, it becomes more textural than punk-loud; and that coarse chord progression that thunks its way pragmatically through their songs' clever, well-defined melodies has become more idiosyncratic. Sure, it isn't unique, but Gilbride and Crutchfield do it irresistibly; it defines the band more and more as they progress, and it's one of their strongest suits, second only to their knack for marrying familiar alt-rock re-interpretations to cuttingly contemporary sentiments.</p>
<p><i>Surfing </i>contains few of its light-footed predecessor's<i> </i>punky sparks, so often the recalibrated songs come off a little sludgy and unfocused. ""Mermaid"", an earful of definitive, muttering distortion, might seem the obvious example, but the mid-tempo ""Echo Locate"" and psychedelic, piano-lined ""Glare of the Sun"" are the bigger culprits. ('""Echo"", despite its powerful chorus, has an off-puttingly slow start and ""Glare,"" for better or worse, is Swearin's take on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqHKGcujap0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Blake Sennett solo number</a> that appears on every <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3575-rilo-kiley/"">Rilo Kiley</a> album.) The catharsis of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo_gim_yl44"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kenosha""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFhXVIxOldA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Crashing""</a> doesn't live here, and the respite we do get, in a song like ""Loretta's Flowers""—the album's simplest, loveliest, most affecting cut, about trying to help a loved one who doesn't want to be saved—drops the record in the other direction, into half-resentful heartbreak. Unlike on <i>Swearin'</i>, there's little hope for sonic comfort from reality, save perhaps ""Young"", a tellingly titled, sprightly love song that despite its optimism seems detached from its LP-mates. But that trudge is the essence of this second round, and in that it's effective. <i>Surfing</i> takes the disenchanted bits of <i>Swearin' </i>and blows them out into 34 minutes of honed unrest—it's a self-aware, deliberate, and ultimately truthful sophomore slump.</p></div>"|18589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18589-swearin-surfing-strange/|7.6|Devon Maloney

You can hear some of Kendrick's Chosen-One determination, some of Meek Mill's life-or-death panic. He can rap in acrobatic thickets, flipping in and out of double and triple time. But the star of his debut EP is not Doley: it is Doley's producer MP Williams, who supervises the entire project, and who drapes the record in a thousand glorious rippling harps and interstellar synths. Williams is probably best known to the world for ""Ghetto Symphony"", from A$AP Rocky's <i>LongLiveA$AP, </i>and if the sprawling, gorgeous sound of <i>Just in Case</i> is any indication, he has the kind of reach and ambition that warrants a full-length instrumental LP. On <i>Just In Case</i>, he's in permanent ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWwvGecvYP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">smoking weed under star projectors</a>"" mode.</p>
<p>There are a lot of big ideas siphoned off from other major artists sluicing around <i>Just In Case</i>. The melted, downcast mood and rainy synth pads are post-<i>Take Care; </i>the nested, suitelike song structure and psychedelic over-ripeness is post-<i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. </i>But even if Doley and Williams are chasing down big ambitions with borrowed parts, the sounds themselves are overwhelming. A few moments here are worth the price of admission: The downshift halfway through ""Just In Case"", where Williams clobbers us with treated vocal hits; the slowed string pads fighting through clotted air on ""We Belong Here"", the deadmau5 sample that sits at the center of the nerve-twitch drums on ""Raise Your Weapon"". Doley raps about struggles and desperation, but the music is soft, dreamlike, and gentle, the drum programming skittering across the surface like water bugs.</p>
<p>Doley and Williams have pitched <i>Just In Case</i> as an EP, which laughably undersells what they're doing. The album feels painstakingly crafted, and formally ambitious as a whole, in a way that 99 percent of free rap releases don't. Song structures maul themselves and twist into new shapes that have nothing to do with pure rap: ""Till We Fall"" changes key, loses its drums, and subsides into an intimate James Blake cyber-mumble for its chorus. ""Darkside Glow"" interrupts itself three-quarters of the way through with another beat, this one warped and hissy, dropping in like a skipping turntable. </p>
<p>Doley's small, urgent voice flits around this grand canvas ably. He's technically brilliant as a rapper, and his greatest gifts are ferociousness and tenacity—when he digs into a beat, he leaves claw marks. As a sheer display of raw skill, ""Blessed"" is stunning, on ""I Know Pain"", he harmonizes with himself in triple time, a la Bone Thugs. He pours a tremendous amount of emotional information into each verse, which is why it's disappointing that so much of it slides off; his vocal delivery just isn't distinctive enough, his writing not flavorful enough, for his hunger to stick. He's pained, he's hungry, he's true of heart—except for a few powerfully honest moments on ""Tommy &amp; Keish"" and ""I Know Pain"" he doesn't manage to communicate much more to us than that.</p>
<p>Still, he often sounds incredible, even if what he's here to tell us hasn't quite come into focus. He's aligned himself with a producer with a powerful artistic vision, and he's forged a calling-card debut project with a unique imprint. Even if Doley sounds vaguely like a few other rappers, not a lot of street-level rap, and almost no New York rap, feels like <i>Just In Case</i>. That takes savvy, and demands attention, and <i>Just In Case</i> will probably win him some diehard fans that he deserves.</p></div>"|18653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18653-doley-bernays-just-in-case/|7.0|Jayson Greene

Actually, they don’t get <i>any </i>credit, understandable in light of the Denton, Tex., sextet's antiquated imagery and sepia-drunk sound. But the formula that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9191-the-trials-of-van-occupanther/""><i>The Trials of Van Occupanther </i></a>a sleeper hit in 2006—bearded indie-folk meets California soft-rock meets Fleetwood Mac at their most glassy-eyed—would likely make it a <i>massive</i> success in 2013. It’s certainly in their best interest to revisit that style after the clock-stopping Tull torpor of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13885-the-courage-of-others/""><i>The Courage of Others</i></a>, and guitarist Eric Pulido claims their fourth LP <i>Antiphon</i> “is the most honest representation of the band as a whole.” Except he goes on to say, “as opposed to one person’s vision that we were trying to facilitate.” Pulido got an internal promotion to frontman after the departure of singer-songwriter Tim Smith in 2012, and...shots fired?</p>
<p><i>Antiphon</i> does somehow manage to be a “forget everything you know about Midlake!” album as well as a “return to form,” at least if you remember that <i>Van Occupanther</i> was preceded by the burlier, less precious (title aside) <i>Bamnan and Silvercork</i> in 2004. Pulido’s words foreshadow a more aggressive tack on the part of Midlake and they certainly oblige during the first half of <i>Antiphon</i>. If the title track and “Provider” don’t exactly boogie, they’re at least rollin’ and tumblin’, with the shuffling beats and sticky, distorted guitar leads that invert Midlake’s previous ratio of rock to folk. More notably, the flutes and other non-strung instruments are pushed to the periphery, foregrounding a lightly psychedelic blues that I suppose recalls Fleetwood Mac before <i>their</i> big personnel shakeup. Likewise, Pulido begins the record asking the listener to “start a war,” and goes on to speak of foxholes and space shuttles. There’s even one song called “It’s Going Down”, which doesn’t sound all that more vigorous than what came before it, but hey, make your own Yung Joc ""meet me at the farmer's market"" jokes.</p>
<p>But throughout, it’s clear that Smith’s departure is an amputation that doesn’t change Midlake’s DNA. They’ve got a couple of opening gigs for Pearl Jam in the near future, so that should give you an idea of whether they’ve retained the earnestness of their previous work. Pulido doesn’t have Smith’s distinct, dulcet tone, though it’s actually to Midlake’s advantage on <i>Antiphon</i>. His vocals are alopecia-stricken, almost fascinating in their lack of texture even when layered in harmony, offering no resistance to the bulkier music backing him. So <i>Antiphon</i> never sounds awkward even when he sings about space travel on “Corruption” (“we went to the moon/ with a tycoon”) in a way that comes off as quaint as the more typically Midlake-y concerns like sorting out “The Old and the Young” and having a good woman waiting at home by the fire. </p>
<p>The bigger shift is in the production, provided by Grammy-nominated Tony Hoffer. His most frequently cited credits are Beck and Air, who both ended up working with Nigel Godrich on their very next albums, so I’ve come to think of his aesthetic as a kind of Radiohead starter kit. Midlake get that kind of sound here—you wouldn’t call it overproduced, but there’s tons of <i>production</i> if you know where to listen for it, as the stereo panning is neatly utilized, the percussion crisp and non-obtrusive, while all of the folk instruments are spit-shined and shellacked. It’s a retro-modernist (or modernist-retro) schematic, aspiring for Laurel Canyon decor while paying West Hollywood rent.</p>
<p>As far as, the songs themselves—well, to <i>Antiphon</i>’s credit, it's a very consistent record. And to its detriment, it's a very consistent record. While <i>Antiphon</i> might be the most honest representation of Midlake, Smith’s ostensible iron fist penned songs like “Roscoe” and “We Gathered In Spring”, songs that bore a personality and vision that the overly democratic <i>Antiphon</i> eschews. The nice things I thought I was going to say about the title track are actually applicable to “Provider” once I remembered which one was which. “It’s Going Down” also stood out mainly because it repeats the title, “Vale” only because it’s an instrumental and thus the most memorable song here by default. After “Vale”, side B of <i>Antiphon</i> has about as much melodic grounding as a drone record, and if it wasn’t for a reprise of “Provider” at the close, you’d be hard pressed to recall the goodwill generated at the beginning.</p>
<p>And that’s problematic, because if they aren’t going to offer much in the way of innovation or currency, Midlake should at the very least be tuneful enough to counterbalance it. In our review of Swans’ pulverizing two-hour art-rock opus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer""><i>The Seer</i></a>, Mike Powell explained its appeal by paraphrasing a quote from Ben Marcus regarding the nature of experimental fiction: <span>it wasn't a record for someone deciding whether or not they'd rather be listening to music or playing paintball</span>. By the same token, Midlake isn’t competing with Swans records. Considering who they <i>are</i> competing with makes for an even less flattering comparison. It’s not hard to find folky rock bands with stronger melodies, bolder personae, or even ones that are just flat-out weirder while operating squarely within the mainstream: let’s not forget that Fleet Foxes used a couple minutes of saxophone on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15363-helplessness-blues"">their last album</a> and purists flipped the fuck out. That doesn’t change the fact that <i>Antiphon </i>is still a likeable, pleasant listen that will always wait for you by the hearth after a long day. But for a “forget everything you know about Midlake!” album, it's almost exactly how you remember them.</p></div>"|18696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18696-midlake-antiphon/|6.0|Ian Cohen

Math! Terrific. A sentence later he brings up his admiration for soft-rocker Bruce Hornsby. At 25, Hinton may have already blown the youth vote.</p>
<p><i>Nonfiction </i>isn’t an album easily pegged to any scene or narrative currently circulating about electronic music. Its rhythms are rooted in hip-hop, drum &amp; bass, and late-90s R&amp;B, rendered on the scale of someone making music more for home listening than club play. Even at its busiest, the album feels tidy and compact, like the gears of a prewar pocketwatch. (What’s interesting to me about Hinton’s syncopations—the jazzy, double-time blasts of hi-hat and snare drum—is that syncopation is usually used to make a straight beat sound momentarily off-balance, whereas on <i>Nonfiction</i>, the more syncopated the tracks are, the more orderly they feel.)</p>
<p>Nearly every track here is pretty, in the most conventional sense of the word. Soft pianos, fake strings, bass that stretches like taffy, and synth blips that twinkle like itsy bitsy stars—if the sounds on <i>Nonfiction </i>showed up on your doorstep in the dead of night, you’d probably let them in without question. On a lot of the album<i>, </i>Hinton’s approach reminds me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a> circa <i>Richard D. James</i> tracks like “4” and “Girl/Boy Song”—songs that juxtapose a cute surface with a hard-hitting, even threatening undercurrent. The difference is that James is a perennial misfit who always seemed to be half-joking and Hinton operates with the earnestness of a post-rock band working in miniature.</p>
<p><i>Nonfiction</i>'s highlights-- ""Metal Swing,"" ""Jamie"" and ""FM Myth""-- are built around vocal samples. House and dance music have a long tradition of making the human voice do contortions on tape that they could never do live—a possibility afforded by samplers and digital recording, which enable producers to chop, cut, paste, and loop in ways that would’ve been agonizing in the analog era. On <i>Nonfiction</i>, Hinton allows his vocalists full phrases, sometimes even sentences. Usually, these vocalists are gruff-sounding English dudes who seem to have been wounded by something they aren’t ready to get too specific about. (Hinton says he mostly finds them on YouTube, a site that lets us glimpse into the lives of strangers in a way that feels both intimate and yet impossibly cryptic.) They repeat their laments, sometimes for minutes on end, while the music grows steadily around them. The result feels like a series of time-lapse portraits of people refusing to change despite their changing environment—a nice, melancholy touch on an album that tends to take extroverted music and turn it inward.</p>
<p>Even if you listen to <i>Nonfiction</i>—and even if you like it—it probably won’t inspire you to call anyone up and say, “[Expletive], I just got back from the library, or the office, or picking up [friend’s name] at the airport, and I had this new Range album on at a reasonable volume the whole time, and it totally increased my general sense of well-being!” What it might inspire, though, is a kind of passive, slowly gestating admiration—the kind usually best measured in iTunes plays three or four months down the line, the kind you tend to recognize several hours into a workday in front of your computer, the kind that doesn’t surge like a fire but instead grows patiently, like a vine. </p></div>"|18679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18679-the-range-nonfiction/|8.2|Mike Powell

Starting with his 2010 EP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14301-curtis-lane-ep/"">Curtis Lane</a>, </i>the music Grossi performs as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28560-active-child"">Active Child</a> aspired to be every bit as singular, situating his rangy vocals within post-dubstep clicks, porcelain R&amp;B and a ghosted production aesthetic. Yet, by his 2011 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15745-you-are-all-i-see/""><i>You Are All I See</i></a>, Active Child became a strangely centrist affair, as artists that shared many of those stylistic tics (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>, collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"">How To Dress Well</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28714-jai-paul/"">Jai Paul</a>) were some of the year’s major indie figures. His new EP <i>Rapor</i> turns out to be every bit as momentous as <i>You Are All I See</i>, but for the exact opposite reasons. Whereas the center had once shifted to a sound Active Child had been developing for years, in 2013, Grossi’s aiming squarely for an established, already-crowded middle.</p>
<p>And so, you’ll get a lot of “what the kids are into these days” on <i>Rapor</i>. There isn’t much harp here at all—the pristine spaces of his previous work are filled with louder beats, louder synths and a shift from stained glass preciousness to neon pop. Grossi’s voice remains, and that’s a good thing, as his falsetto is distinct amongst his peers, a strangely chesty thing that recalls Philip Bailey of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (and also, “Easy Lover”). It was best utilized on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12254-hanging-on/"">“Hanging On”</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12221-playing-house-ft-how-to-dress-well/"">“Playing House”</a>, tortured slow burners that gave a soulful edge to music that was often a little too monastic for some.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Unfortunately, <i>Rapor</i> tries to shift to more extroverted, club-friendly aesthetic while still presenting Active Child as deadly serious business. And without pop’s pleasure principle, <i>Rapor </i>often ends up sounding unintentionally silly rather than fun (much like the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3COzIGr1U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">“Playing House” video</a>). Up-and-comer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30854-mykki-ekko"">Mikky Ekko</a> shows up to contribute nasal half-raps on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15995-subtle-ft-mikky-ekko"">“Subtle”</a> and what should be some airy pop piffle (“the beat goes on and on forever/and the record on repeat comes back around/girl you don’t wanna be alone dancing in the dark”) bears an unfortunate poptimist studiousness; it’s the work of people desperately trying to tell you they <i>really mean it</i>. As a result, “Subtle” recalls the unfortunate “urban” deep cut you’d find tacked onto late 90s boy band albums. Meanwhile, a guest spot from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28682-ellie-goulding"">Ellie Goulding</a> provides a tremendous profile boost to blatantly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a>-styled stargazing duet “Silhouette”, but neither her vaporous vocals or the hollowed-out synth toms help it achieve liftoff.</p>
<p>The remainder of <i>Rapor</i> isn’t bad, just disappointing in the sense that a potentially unique artist sounds all too eager to look at the indie-pop landscape, say “me too!” and little else. As with <i>You Are All I See</i>, Grossi’s songwriting is still ostensibly personal, but lack any sort of defining character—typical lyrics like “Take me back to the start/before we ever fell apart”, indicate <i>Rapor</i> could be viewed as a pocket-sized breakup album, but combined with the standard-issue arrangements behind them, it could really be anyone’s.<i> Rapor</i> should be a display of Grossi’s adaptability, but it just ends up leaving you to wonder what he actually stands for as an artist.</p></div>"|18673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18673-active-child-rapor-ep/|5.6|Ian Cohen

There’s usually some darkness in the music she makes as <a href=""Make%20yourself%20uncomfortable%20in%20the%20hotel%20that%20inspired%20Stephen%20King.."">Circuit Des Yeux</a>, and often a lot of it. Drop your needle anywhere within her discography and even the most upbeat songs sound deadly serious. Her early records sometimes distanced that somber tone with thick distortion or hissy echo, which added mystery. But over time her work has become clearer, and <i>Overdue</i>, her fourth full-length, is the most direct, immediate record she’s made. It’s also her best.</p>
<p>That’s because increased clarity reveals how many ways Fohr can hit the same emotional target. There’s variety in the instrumentation: dramatic, string-like synths, bittersweet acoustic strums, grinding electric guitars, and all kinds of rhythmic foundations. There’s also variety in her voice, which echoes the melancholy warble of<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/""> Antony</a>, the goth-howl of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1672-diamanda-galas/"">Diamanda Galás</a>, and the chilly authority of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>. But she also has a unique way of turning every phrase dark. It’s hard to imagine anyone else making a casual line like “rollin’ in my Nova 88” sound so grave.</p>
<p>That line shows the variety of lyrical angles Fohr is willing to take, trusting that a committed approach can add weight to any sentiment. She’s right: every couplet and stanza on <i>Overdue </i>is forceful, no matter what Fohr’s singing about. Roughly half the songs are sung in second person, giving them a fateful hue. “When your body leaves you/ You won’t need anything to hold onto,” she sings in “Hegira”, as if she’s a god reporting the future.  The rest use first person, suggesting Fohr’s a victim of the same fate she just foretold. “Who has learned to bleed my innards?/ Who has given me the deepest winters?” she sings in the slow, minimal “Acarina”, over music that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30653-bodyhead/"">Body/Head</a> covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a>. Those and many of Fohr’s words dodge literal interpretation, dislocated from whatever specific scenarios inspired them. But there is one couplet that seems like a clear statement of intent: “If the truth sets you free/ I’d rather be living in my dreams.”</p>
<p>Each song on <i>Overdue </i>feels like a lived-in dream—not just in its hypnotic, voice-in-head sound, but also in the way Fohr builds atmosphere like a sonic set designer. Gradually, details accumulate and an internal logic takes over. Sometimes this comes from simple increases in activity, as instruments rise toward mutual climaxes. But in other spots the ascent is sneakier, taking you places before you know it. Take “Bud &amp; Gin”, whose folky lilt feels repetitive, but eventually—with the help of Fohr’s ambient moans—traverses a range of moods. At the end, she literally rewinds the song, as if she’s become so caught up in it that the only way to find her footing is to retrace her steps.</p>
<p>Such wanderings may make <i>Overdue </i>sound like heavy going, and certainly much of it is. But Fohr puts so much power behind her music that following her into the emotional depths can be intoxicating, and even life-affirming. After all, one of the best things art can do is make you feel something, whatever that something may be. On <i>Overdue</i>,<i> </i>Haley Fohr is more than up to that task.</p></div>"|18684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18684-circuit-des-yeux-overdue/|7.2|Marc Masters

The multitudes of producers influenced by the Detroit beatmaker’s sample chopping, drum-slicing ways have gone on to make some of the more progressive music out right now, to the point where <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17510-donuts-45-box-set/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Donuts</a>, </i>in its influence, can be seen as a beat record analogue to the influence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17129-the-velvet-underground-nico/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""><i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i></a>.  At the same time, those who have control over the Detroit producer’s actual trove of beats have burrowed further into themselves, making, for the most part, conservative, reactionary rap music.  The majority of posthumous releases featuring Dilla’s name have been stuffy at best, and at worst, stunted by a paralysis-inducing reverence that makes it impossible for the featured rappers to explore new territory.</p>
<p>One of the exceptions to that rule was the album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12438-yancey-boys/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yancey Boys</i></a> from Dilla’s younger brother, who goes by the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26897-illa-j/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Illa J</a>. The album worked, mostly because it was powered by a primo selection of early Dilla beats, but also due to Illa’s understated approach to lyrics. The key to the success of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3834-slum-village/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Slum Village</a> records that Dilla produced was T3 and Baatin’s willingness to let the beats carry the weight, keeping their rhymes light and fluffy. Illa J with typical younger sibling reverence, adhered to the same philosophy in 2008, and does so again on his new release <i>Sunset Blvd.</i>, this time with old Dilla associate Frank Nitt representing as another member of the Yancey Boys and a whole gang of Dilla-ites along for the ride.</p>
<p>That the record features another bumper crop of previously unreleased Dilla beats goes a long way towards explaining its success. “Fisherman”, the first song on the album, is a wonderful example, turning on a beautiful loop which finds Dilla operating in California soul-tinged boom-bap. The beats here are mostly in that mold, warm counterpoints to the <i>Fantastic</i>-era Detroit beats, on which Dilla is subtly breaking out of the rigid boom-bap template in ways that hint at his unique ability to maintain control while working with a vast array of dynamic sounds. (Check, for instance, the way that the sampled cover of “Let the Sun Shine Is” is melded into different beats on “Jeep Volume.”)</p>
<p>Backpack rap like that featured on <i>Sunset Blvd. </i>is often stigmatized as rappity-rap, lyricism for lyricism’s sake that is often exhausting in its density. To the contrary, most of the verses featured on the record are golden-age throwbacks, the raps serving as little more than additional structure through which the loops reverberate. Dilla’s beats need space: the rappers here, most prominently Illa J (a much better rhymer than his brother was) are aware of that.</p>
<p>Then too, there are star turns from veterans sometimes thought to be over the hill: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2348-talib-kweli/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Talib Kweli</a> has a beautiful feature on “Flowers”, and even in self-aggrandizing mode, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Common</a> delivers a verse that’s a reminder of the rapper he once was. The worst part of the record though comes from a third veteran, albeit one without the resume of those first two. Frank Nitt has trouble even blending into the background, so cringe-worthy are some of his rhymes and because he's an honorific Yancey Boy, he gets plenty screen time here. The worst attempt at simile on the record belongs to him (“spot you like you Spotify”) but there are plenty of candidates to choose from, and his instincts are still to pile on Dilla beatification which most of the other featured rappers thankfully avoid. The beats, after all, say everything that needs to be said.</p>
<p>Illa J has shown a penchant for straightforward soul in the past, and the slower tracks on the album sparkle. The handclap-happy “Rock My World” has the energy of early aughts B. Rich while Eric Roberson’s turn on the early cut “Lovin’ U” is an early indication of this project’s ambition in comparison to other recent Dilla projects. We get so used to hearing Dilla’s rap beats (there was a five-year time period when every rapper on the come-up would freestyle over “Lightworks”) that we sometimes take for granted the immensity of the musician we lost. Hearing how good his beats sound when turned to soul and R&amp;B makes for a fresh reminder of Dilla’s immense talent, and the ways that it could have been shaped to all kinds of genres, how much he had to contribute to the wider world of music.</p>
<p>But <i>Sunset Blvd.</i> refuses to let itself be colored by regret. This is the most joyous record that we’ve seen from Dilla’s disciples since the producer’s death in 2006. By avoiding the tendency to wallow in the past or to define itself in opposition to contemporary rap, it joins the ranks of albums from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18353-pete-rock-camp-lo-80-blocks-from-tiffanys-pt-ii/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Camp Lo</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18615-black-milk-no-poison-no-paradise/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Black Milk</a>, two other former backpack acts who updated their formula successfully this year, breaking free of the cliches that had held them back and making genuinely engaging hip-hop music.</p></div>"|18685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18685-yancey-boys-sunset-blvd/|7.3|Jonah Bromwich

The self-described “boy band” are on Planet Mu, one of electronic music’s more experimental “big” labels. Steve Moore, the American behind the album’s lush bed of electronics, is a synth wizard known for his droning epics, lush dance tracks, and italo-aping band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27825-zombi/"" target=""_blank"">Zombi</a>. UK singer Daniel O’Sullivan, meanwhile, has worked with any number of left-field rock outfits from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a> to Guapo (the band he fronts). Together, they make creeping synth pop that feels like Depeche Mode steeped in the fog of the Misty Mountains—there’s nothing really experimental, dance, or rock about it at all. It’s moody and serious stuff, evident from the outset with “Good Love”, where arpeggios snake at a glacial pace as O’Sullivan bellows about the “most high, all-powerful good love” with all the pomp and circumstance of a late 70s fantasy metal epic.</p>
<p><span>If it wasn’t obvious from that, there’s something else running underneath <i>Mercury</i> than the facile synth-pop revivalist label that others will lobby at it. Let’s get this out of the way: O’Sullivan has a pleasing, resolutely British voice that recalls a higher-register Dave Gahan—he’s a dead ringer on “Something Is Wrong”, which has an existential-dread chorus (“Something is wrong/ I don’t know what it means to be in love”) that would be a long lost <i>Black Celebration </i>cut<i>. </i>But most of the time, O’Sullivan is his own artist in spite of superficial semblances, and his arch phrasing is more goth-inflected folk than fey synth-pop posturing. There’s also a certain muscular chug to these tracks that you wouldn’t necessarily get from mid-80s Sire Records—a propulsive crawl learned from Moore’s dance records and his work in Zombi.</span></p>
<p><span>Those synths? They make the record, which is important, because <i>Mercury </i>is <i>all</i> synths—no guitars or anything that sounds close to a band here. It's a beautifully-produced record, with such a grasp on its machines that it doesn’t even need straight drums—the title track is a buzzing collection of cogs and whirling machinery, woodpecker woodblocks, and other strange percussive devices driving it forward in the place of lumpen drum machines. Moore’s unique sensibilities can jar with O’Sullivan’s pop ambitions as much as they elevate them, however. On “Neverending Arc”, a walk-in freezer of horror synths and creepy arpeggios, O’Sullivans leaden melody lines slide right off Moore’s icy walls, and the grand power ballad “Breathless” doesn’t have a grandiose hook to match its “Take My Breath Away” bombast.</span></p>
<p><span>The album’s final passage offers up a glimpse at an alternate mode for the duo. Penultimate track “Wild Nights” is a windswept series of arpeggios that feels like psychedelic-era Beatles as imagined by William Orbit, and the perpetual krautrock groove is carried over into 10-minute closer “Organon”. Here, one of Moore’s characteristic long-form swirls is given over to eerie chanting by O’Sullivan, indulging in the eerie English folk tradition that he hints at elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span>While it’s easy enough to imagine how wonderful an LP made up entirely of these yawning ambient tracks would be, that’s not entirely fair to Moore and O’Sullivan. <i>Mercury </i>feels like an addition to the canon of 80s synth pop albums rather than an attempt to xerox them, mainly because of its sincerity—there’s no sly winking or irony here, period. That it such a record would come on Planet Mu and be produced by these two particular artists is a strange story indeed, but the music speaks for itself—anyone who fancies long lost synth-pop obscurities would probably find at least a few songs to like on <i>Mercury</i>.</span></p></div>"|18724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18724-miracle-mercury/|6.7|Andrew Ryce

But since the release of that video—and the game-changing album from which it sprung, <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>—that long-distance runner could very well represent the average Flaming Lips fan: Since dramatically shifting aesthetic chorus at the top of the millenium, the Lips have been a hard band to keep up with, indulging us in both the thrill of the chase and the exhaustion that inevitably results from it. </p>
<p>Even as they’ve entered their fourth decade of existence, the band has become more outrageously prolific with each passing year, as the expediency of the internet age—combined with the band’s inherent resourcefulness—has allowed them to document and release their every passing whim, and seemingly record with every artist they’ve ever posed with for a backstage festival selfie. The band’s unforgivably bleak 13th album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17804-the-flaming-lips-the-terror/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Terror</i></a>, had barely settled onto record shelves last April when we received word of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50197-the-flaming-lips-working-on-album-with-keha/"" target=""_blank"">an upcoming full-album tryst with Ke$ha</a>, and even that’s since been superseded by a just-announced, imminent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52478-flaming-lips-tame-impala-to-cover-each-other-on-collaborative-ep/"" target=""_blank"">split-release with Tame Impala</a>. We’re at the point now where the Lips’ proper records feel less like a cumulative elaboration of their interim activities than a respite from them.</p>
<p>But even for a band that’s experimented with every type of release format—from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8017-time-capsule/6/"" target=""_blank"">simultaneously played quadruple-CD</a> sets to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41760-the-flaming-lips-are-making-gummy-skulls-now/"" target=""_blank"">USB singles encased in foodstuffs</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44455-listen-to-the-flaming-lips-twenty-four-hour-song-starting-right-now/"" target=""_blank"">songs that require you to book a day off work to listen to</a>—the <i>Peace Sword</i> EP holds a unique place among the Lips’ sprawling discography. The Lips have sporadically released EPs before, but—outside of their unrecognizably garage-grimed 1984 debut—they’ve usually taken the form of intra-band collaborations or an official single padded out with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSEgf8frI_A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covers</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FldyOzvNx88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">demos</a>, and other <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7cyQsYz_jY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">novelties</a> (not to mention some canonical <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48_Yz3Sqv0Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lost</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc43yX9w4sU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gems</a>). But <i>Peace Sword</i> is something else: a holistic six-song release that, at 36 minutes, basically counts as the second full-length album the Flaming Lips have released in 2013.</p>
<p>The EP originated as another one of the Lips’ one-off larks: they were asked to contribute to the soundtrack of the upcoming science-fiction epic <i>Ender’s Game</i> (adapted from the 1985 novel by Orson Scott Card), and while lead-off track “Peace Sword (Open Your Heart)” will appear in the film, the EP is fleshed out by songs that were inspired by the movie but were rejected by its makers. Of course, a film set in a future where humanity can only be saved from alien-wrought extinction by a humble hero is hardly a thematic stretch for the Flaming Lips; of the two albums the band has released this year, one opens with the lyric, “There’s a little spaceship/ hiding in the clouds,” and it’s not even the one that was commissioned for a sci-fi flick. But if <i>Peace Sword</i> carries over <i>The Terror</i>’s dystopian chill, synth-smeared mistiness, and emotional fragility, it’s informed as much by another Lips experiment from earlier this spring: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77dF-S_dA2o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their full-album remount of 2002’s <i>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</i></a> at South by Southwest.</p>
<p>The two albums represent the yin and yang of the Lips’ post-millennial catalogue: both are informed by the uncertainty of the future, but where <i>The Terror</i> translates that into anxiety and despair, <i>Yoshimi</i> is more playful and optimistic. <i>Peace Sword—</i>much like<i> Ender's Game </i>itself<i>—</i>is thus a proverbial <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EbrMAZbFpo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fight test</a>, the space where the Lips’ light and dark energies square off in battle, sometimes within the same song. “Peace Sword (Open Your Heart)” oozes forth with such kaleidoscopic splendor, you can practically feel <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja-wUwWYJrI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the multi-coloured balloons bounce off your head</a>, but as Coyne repeats that deceptively optimistic parenthetical refrain, the song undergoes a slow decay: the drum beat starts sputtering out, the background symphonic-synth fuzz becomes blindingly overpowering, and the overall mood turns from celebratory to sorrowful. However, the lush, decadanse ballad “Is the Black at the End Good"", works the other way, with Coyne’s stark, self-doubting verses blossoming into a resplendent, arm-swaying chorus that renders the Lips’ recent half-baked <i>Terror</i> bonus-cut cover of “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyIxZbsSBlA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">All You Need Is Love</a>” all the more superfluous. (And, intentionally or not, the song’s all-inclusive, hippy-dippy sentiment—“everywhere where love is/ that’s where I will be”—feels like an especially subversive affront to Orson Scott Card’s <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">notoriously ultra-conservative views</a> on gay marriage.) </p>
<p>In light of <i>The Terror</i> and its equally unnerving predecessor <i>Embryonic</i>, it’s been a while since we’ve heard the Lips sound so guilelessly heartfelt and anthemic as they do here; with its acoustic strums smothered in ersatz, synthetic orchestration, “Think Like a Machine, Not a Boy” plays like a “Do You Realize?” in lysergic slow motion, granting Coyne more time to savor “the beauty that surrounds me.” In contrast to these surprising moments of radiance, <i>Peace Sword</i>’s more downcast material feels less revelatory. “If They Move, Shoot ‘Em” (not to be confused with Primal Scream’s “If They Move, Kill ‘Em”) is essentially a spin-off of the <i>Terror</i> highlight “Butterfly, How Long It Takes to Die"", though it does boast an equally compelling, climatic build-up over a hypnotically stuttering drum break. However, the repetitious prog-funk creeper “Wolf Children” falls flat, and the 11-minute finale “Assassin Beetle – The Dream Is Ending” tries to stitch together instrumental and lyrical motifs from throughout the EP into an ominous closing suite, but its mounting lurch to the finish is too dreary to feel dramatic. “The dream is ending,” Coyne gravely intones throughout the piece’s chilliest stretch, suggesting that, in this war over control of the Flaming Lips' psyche, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f87siGRmwYc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">evil has prevailed</a>. But the triumph of <i>Peace Sword</i> is not so much in the outcome, but the valiant battles fought along the way. </p></div>"|18677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18677-the-flaming-lips-peace-sword-ep/|7.3|Stuart Berman

It seemed a hard left turn for an artist who, through a spate of EPs, had practiced obfuscation, both in her music and in her public persona. Halo's releases since <i>Quarantine</i> can be read as a reaction to that album and its reception, as she has steadily retreated from that album's vocally oriented post-pop—and the transparent artistic agency that it implied—into the harsh instrumental strictures of techno. Her second album, the dynamic, bracing <i>Chance of Rain</i>, continues this transition, further mussing her artistic motives via industrial rhythms and corrosive synth textures.</p>
<p>The music on <i>Chance of Rain</i> defies easy placement—probably on purpose. It flickers between 90s-era IDM fussiness, warped hypnagogic sentimentality, and actual club music meant to inspire dancing. Sometimes it stops, mid-song—as on the title track—to wade through a pretty, jazzy piano melody, only to later return to its choppy, crunching kick drum attacks. This sense of placelessness, its ability to obscure its purpose and cloak its creator, defines <i>Chance of Rain</i>. It's a Laurel Halo album in name; when it plays you don't spend much time thinking about its creator or her motives.</p>
<p>Two pretty, jazzy piano pieces bookend <i>Chance of Rain</i>, reminding us of the oft-repeated fact that Halo is a formally trained musician. In between, <i>Chance of Rain</i> is a near constant churn of effects and shifting rhythms, frequently interrupting itself to wander in new directions. The longer tracks—""Oneiroi"" and ""Thrax"" in particular—are stop-and-start affairs whose tough beats resist momentum. There's a crankiness to <i>Chance of Rain</i>, as noxious, cloudy chords hover above even the most motive tracks (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16111-ainnome/"" target=""_blank"">Ainnome</a>"", ""Serendip""). Tonally, <i>Chance of Rain</i> is peers with the hoary machine music being churned out by the L.I.E.S. label, but there's an odd iridescence to Halo's work not found in other noisy, underground dance music.</p>
<p>When <i>Chance of Rain</i> slows down, as on the perplexing ""Still/Dromos"" or ""Melt"", it feels industrial, chemical in its potency. There's an undiluted quality to the sounds Halo conjures, and its 44 minute runtime requires some endurance. Frequently ugly, <i>Chance of Rain</i> doesn't court affection, and it's hard to nestle up to something that's continually slew-footing you. <i>Quarantine</i> was a difficult listen because it sounded as if Halo was right in your ear; on <i>Chance of Rain</i> she only appears to chop at your knees before dashing back into the shadows.</p>
<p>Halo spoke to Wire magazine about becoming more comfortable as a producer; <i>Chance of Rain</i> sees her place her gnarly sounds front and center, the way <i>Quarantine</i> did with her voice. The result is still unnerving, though in a more subtle way (no one is likely to tell Halo her synthesizers are too loud, or not tuneful enough). When the album finds a moment of peace—like when the title track dissolves into a simple, noir-ish outro—it feels forged. Craggy and hard as hell, you'll wish <i>Chance of Rain</i> forged a few more such moments, but its consistent, nagging ability to knock you off balance is worth wrestling with.</p></div>"|18678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18678-laurel-halo-chance-of-rain/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

It is beautifully, pristinely recorded, finely wrought; its ten songs represent some of the least insistent music you will be spellbound by all year. Kivel's close-miked acoustic guitar strums close to your ear, but everything above it, from Kivel's high, frail falsetto to the washes of electronics that occasionally stop the action, is constantly threatening to dissipate. Kivel wrote and recorded it over the last two years, redirecting his creative efforts away from the band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30203-gap-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Gap Dream</a> in favor of this sort of acoustic music—not quite shapely or distinct enough to be folk, too temporally detached to be grouped near rock— that is simply music we murmur to ourselves. Daily music.</p>
<p>Ever since I first heard <i>Double Exposure</i>, in March, it has been that for me. For awhile, I was hard-pressed to articulate its appeal, even to myself; it was delicate and pretty, for sure, but I was hearing something else in it, something elusive. Now that the record has made its way onto a label, Olde English Spelling Bee, I think I've located what that something is: There is a modesty here, of a particular, almost-holy sort. It's the sort that doesn't much make a spectacle or a point of its own performance. It is simply written into the delivery, in Kivel's musing, unaffected vocals and in his steady, artful finger-picking.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Drake</a> is an obvious comparison point, and a strong one. Like Drake, Kivel doesn't sweat comprehension in his mumbled, blurred lyrics, sharp phrases of which only swim occasionally to the surface: ""You said all these boys will do is fuck/ Take away their cocks and they dry up,"" he sings, startlingly, on the title track. With a lyric sheet, the darkly personal nature of the music swims into focus. ""Pleasure to me/ Wishing I was dead,"" he croons on ""Tetro."" The phrase ""When I'm dead"" is one of the only phrases in ""Eleison.""</p>
<p>There is a frightening amount of death in the record, in fact. But Kivel doesn't seem or sound frightened by it himself—simply drawn toward it, compelled to examine it. The lullaby of ""Rainbow Trout,"" with its refrain of ""sweet babe, don't cry,"" turns on some ghastly imagery: ""As the body/ shook with pain/ It was thrown again and again/ Up against the fissured wall/ Covered in the bile of it's maw."" And on ""Whip,"" he sings gently, clearly, ""I want to kill myself."" The effect is unsettling precisely because you're unsure how unsettled to be—the song appears to be told from the perspective of a whipped horse, and the phrase is sung so lightly, over an ascending finger-picked line, that the overwhelming emotional message is one of contentment, serenity.  </p>
<p>Mark Nieto produced <i>Double Exposure</i>, and his work is strong enough to serve as a supporting character. (Paul Oldham mixed and mastered the album). Atmosphere is a fragile strength, the first quality to disappear when pressed, but it blossoms in headphones, and it's really in this setting that you should hear <i>Double Exposure</i>. The muffled boom of the bass drum on ""White Rice"", the pearly piano notes, ringing down a long hallway in ""Rainbow Trout"", the humming—insect looping guitars that swarm through ""All Will Be Well"", the small bursts of static at the edges of ""Days of Heaven""—each touch registers like an event within the hallowed space that Kivel creates. The album doesn't so much grow on you as accrete, like daytime shadow creeping across the room. It's been seven months since I first tried to puzzle out <i>Double Exposure</i>, and it keeps eluding me. I don't know when I'll want to stop trying, but not soon. </p></div>"|18651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18651-matt-kivel-double-exposure/|8.0|Jayson Greene

Before the self-titled space-disco gem that put Black Devil on the map 35 years ago, Fevre worked in the production music library trenches. Rather than a nascent Giorgio Moroder-caliber pop innovator, Fevre was more of a style-hopping freelancer whose best work capitalized on streamlining pre-existing trends. Think early 70s Eurodisco progenitors like the Chakachas of “Jungle Fever” fame or Cerrone's work with Kongas, then add first-generation synthesizers and a deliberate eccentricity. Not for nothing is the 1975 L'Illustration Musicale LP that remains the most renowned record under his own name titled “<a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Bernard-Fevre-The-Strange-World-Of-Bernard-Fevre/release/490859"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Strange World of Bernard Fevre</a>”.</p>
<p>The catch with library music is that it's a sort of work-for-hire situation, meant to be a bit modular and generic even at its best. It's a field that can be just as prone to dated imitation as it is timeless experimentation, ignoring the divide between catchiness and cornballery often enough that it falls under irony-courting cringe-whimsy. That's the mode Fevre falls back on in <i>Black Moon White Sun</i>: the music<i> </i>stumbles its way through an uneven if reasonably fun back catalog, gathering all Fevre's odder creative tics into eight tracks' worth of irritainment that feels geared more for post-<i>Barbarella </i>retro-space age camp smirking than any dancefloor worth its bodies.</p>
<p>That's not a bad goal in itself. But there's little room for error when you're trying to evoke a Kubrick-goes-bananas satellite/supperclub vibe. Think less cosmic disco and more a mish-mash of synthesized innovations. Early 70s prog Moogs play mid 80s synthpop with 90s techno chords; rearrange the decades as needed but it's still chronologically dissonant and oddly detached. Midtempo synth-lounge grooves like “Bee Boop” or “Just 3” are diverting their first couple spins, mostly for the hazy nostalgia they might wind up evoking, but give them a little more time and it starts feeling like audio furniture.</p>
<p>It's not just rigidly unfunky, but willfully quirky to a point where even the most die-hard <i>fromage </i>enthusiast might wonder if it wouldn't hurt to be at least a little bit serious. It's grimace-worthy when Fevre dredges up those early 70s notions of Euro-tourist “ethnic” beats, like the bongo-driven quasi-indigenous “Sun Dance Totem” or the goopy cod-Latin “Mexo Mambo”. If it's possible for instrumental tracks to collapse under their own milky sentiment, there's a pretty grueling stretch in the middle: “Maymallow” does <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Pet Shop Boys</a> dirty by extracting all the sly pathos and pop wit that made their hits great, padding it with tinny synth-horns that would make Stock-Aitken-Waterman wrinkle their noses. “Star Dot Com” is the relentlessly chirpy background music for every badly-tracked VHS presentation of “Just What Is the Information Superhighway?” And aside from being saccharine as all hell, “The Kid in Me” demonstrates the biggest failing of <i>Black Moon White Sun.</i> Fevre's voice, best filtered through the Dalek-soul voicebox that made cuts like “H Friend” so alluringly creepy, goes largely untreated—and he sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Chip</a>'s Alexis Taylor if he was drunk, had a frog in his throat, and pronounced all his syllables in reverse so his vocals had to be played backwards. You probably wouldn't want to watch the poorly-dubbed 1981 <i>Buck Rogers </i>knockoff this music would score.</p></div>"|18616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18616-black-devil-disco-club-black-moon-white-sun/|4.6|Nate Patrin

Most modern thrash is sickeningly indebted to the patterns of the 80s: the familiar riffs, the familiar tempos, the familiar denim-and-bullet-belt ensembles, even the same fucking Ed Repka album covers. “You used to do the monkey, but now it's not cool” may be cool again, but you want to know why Metallica, “sell-outs” or “falses” they may be, remain more relevant than Exodus? Metallica wanted more than every one of their contemporaries. First, it was better songs, then it became bigger venues, then it became something we'll never know, but their ambition paid off. Even if commercial success isn't a goal, thrash bands that stand out now do so because of some sort of similar artistic determination. Vektor want to be weirder than Voivod, Iron Age imagined themselves as living Conan posters, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31190-power-trip/"" target=""_blank"">Power Trip</a> simply play harder than the competition.</p>
<p>Chicago's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31754-oozing-wound/"" target=""_blank"">Oozing Wound</a> could be one of those vaulted bands to transcend flatterers, and their debut full-length <i>Retrash</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is certainly more original than the Warbringers and Bonded by Bloods of the world.</span> None of the band members come from thrash backgrounds, and Thrill Jockey doesn't release conventional metal albums. <i>Retrash</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> has been called crossover due to its punk influence, but it's also got grittiness and snottiness more thrash bands could use. The album's first three songs, “Everyone I Hate Should Be Killed”, “New York Bands”, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16158-call-your-guy/"" target=""_blank"">“Call Your Guy”</a> focus on the band's acerbic humor.</span> It's fitting that a Chicago band would have a song titled “New York Bands”—Chicago's a great city, certainly more manageable than New York, but it's not always seen as a place to go and “make it.” Cliques are annoying in all cities, but they're intolerable in New York, because as Oozing Wound rightfully point out, “New York bands, they ain't your friends, they just want your cocaine.” Despite its name, “New York” could also easily be about Los Angeles bands who form themselves around fashion and the hopes of a Century Media deal, rather than standing out and making halfway memorable songs. “Everyone I Hate” has all of the metal's bloodlust with a refreshing sense of candor. Many of us have thought that same thing, even though we won't go as far as to declare “Morality is bad for your health.” There's no fat in the riffage either, which empowers the song's message further.</p>
<p>“Call Your Guy” deals with the perils of scoring drugs, but more importantly, it follows a similar song structure to “New York.” For the first half, guitarist and vocalist Zach Weil will yell his contempt over the band and then he shuts up and lets his riffs do the talking. Most bands would want to repeat verses over those second halves, but Oozing Wound already got their point across, so they proceed to lash out with every riff too punk for Megadeth and too metal for D.R.I. From “Welcome to the Spaceship, Motherfuckers” until closer “Spirit Manimal”, Oozing Wound show how weird they can get, lyrically. “Spaceship” in particular details the cosmic voyage of a baby Jesus, sent into the howling void and never to be heard from again. It's the 2013 version of Florida death metal oddballs Nocturnus' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuF4cqTPxLY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Destroying the Manger”</a>, a tale of going back into time and killing the newborn Christ. With few exceptions, most notably the aforementioned Vektor, you won't see many groups going out on a limb quite like this. Then again, most thrash bands don't have members who've played in various bands in punk houses on the South Side, where experimentation runs free and pretensions get smashed. While it's no <i>Manifest Decimation</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, </span><i>Retrash</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is still one of the year's most notable mutations of thrash, and Oozing Wound show a lot of promise to get even weirder.</span></p></div>"|18644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18644-oozing-wound-retrash/|7.4|Andy O'Connor

Maybe she has in mind her young parents, who put her upbringing in the hands of her grandmother. Or perhaps she’s talking to the A&amp;R team at Capitol Records, who signed her at age 15 in the hopes that she’d become the next Britney. The label orchestrated some minor singles for her (“One” and ""Obsession”), only to let her planned full-length sputter and die along with her recording budget.</p>
<p>It’s also possible she’s addressing the horde of fashion-world supporters who helped her become a raccoon-eyed ingenue better known for looking cool on Terry Richardson’s Tumblr and modeling Hedi Slimane’s Saint Laurent pieces than making music. More plausible still, her followers at large for being seduced by the socialite component while failing to invest in her musical aspirations. And what of her boyfriend, Zachary Cole Smith of bedroom-rock band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/"" target=""_blank"">DIIV</a>, the guy carrying a bunch of heroin when the two were arrested together in upstate New York this fall? At barely 21, Ferreira’s had a musical career burdened—and bolstered—by so many warring external forces and unconventional zig-zagging that the sheer existence of her debut album is a minor miracle.</p>
<p>So it’s both a relief and a bit of a shock that <i>Night Time</i><i>, My Time</i> is not only here, but that it’s one of the most pleasingly conventional and cohesive pieces of pop-rock to come along this year. Particularly given last year’s uneven <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17305-ghost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghost</i> EP</a>, which rode the success of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14138-everything-is-embarrassing/"" target=""_blank"">“Everything Is Embarrassing”</a> and used big-name collaborators to dabble in a sometimes-confusing assortment of styles—Shirley Manson-stamped grunge, singer-songwritery folk, electro-pop. <i>Night Time</i><i>, My Time</i> finds Ferreira navigating her tastes more gracefully, bridging the gaps between 80s pop sparkle and full-bodied 90s grunge in a streamlined way. Her primary collaborator this time is producer Ariel Rechtshaid (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"" target=""_blank"">Solange</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"" target=""_blank"">Usher</a>), a guy known for adding both big-league pop polish to smaller acts and fine-tuning to bigger ones.</p>
<p><i>Night Time, My Time</i> resists the self-serious instinct to position Ferreira as an <i>artist</i> artist— which might have been an especially powerful temptation considering she's a young woman in the music industry who’s spoken about coming into her own sense of agency. She examines emotional neglect (“Nobody Asked Me (If I Was Okay)”) and self-loathing, but also sings clever songs about lifestyle posturing—“Stabbin’ pens in my hand/ But I’m never workin’, just spending/ A giant comedy with museums and shopping with Kristine,” she sings on “Kristine”, a giddily odd track with ska undertones. She’s does her glummest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Chan Marshall</a> impersonation (“Night Time, My Time”), but she also refers to the men in her life as simply <i>boys</i> and isn’t afraid to address them in a purposefully grade-school tone: “Boys, they’re a dime a dozen,” she mutters. “Boys, they just make me mad.” <i>Night Time, My Time</i> isn’t the reactionarily somber anti-pop drag it could have been—instead, it’s a smart Kelly Kapowski hair-whip and loud bubblegum-crack of a record that lends itself to compulsive listening.</p>
<p>All of which was made possible by the unlikely power of “Everything Is Embarrassing”, the subdued electro-pop gem that reoriented Ferreira’s career map altogether last year. (Ferreira is one of the rare artists for whom the word “crossover” has meant a foray into the indiesphere.) The only flashes of that song’s anthemic pop fizz are found on “I Blame Myself”, an uptempo beast that sparkles with the promise of a song destined to become some kind of hit. What’s especially remarkable is that the song achieves the impact of “Everything Is Embarrassing” without its seductive too-cool vacancy—Ferreira now sounds like she has her head held up high instead of glancing down at the floor, bored and ready to leave the party. For someone whose voice often registers at a depressive whisper, she also knows how to look listeners directly in the eye and get them to <i>just listen to her</i>. Finally. She's at the center of her music now, blissfully free of anyone else to blame.</p></div>"|18681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18681-sky-ferreira-night-time-my-time/|8.1|Carrie Battan

A solid Los Campesinos! fan will suspect it’s a (non-American) football reference and have their assumptions confirmed after a quick Google search. A casual Los Campesinos! fan will only understand the second half of the line, as trying to invoke a supernatural hex on a former lover is a fairly common pastime in Gareth’s lyrics. And then there’s the new Los Campesinos! fan, who may not catch any of the lyrics at first, but will enjoy the taut, radiant melodies of “Let It Spill” and maybe even catch its resemblance to a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MxcbB0SFao"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">particularly good Snow Patrol song</a>. Therein lies the triumph of <i>No Blues</i>, LC!’s strongest release since their staggering 2008 two-fer <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11179-hold-on-now-youngster/"">Hold On Now, Youngster...</a>/</i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12424-we-are-beautiful-we-are-doomed/""><i>We Are Beatiful, We Are Doomed </i></a>and a damn near necessary album from a band that had seemed content to be a diehards-only niche affair.</p>
<p>LC! have never made anything close to a <i>bad</i> record, but their two most recent LPs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13879-romance-is-boring/""><i>Romance is Boring</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16036-hello-sadness/""><i>Hello Sadness</i></a>, occasionally struggled under the weight they assumed as a means of “maturing”—namely, Gareth’s increasingly dour lyrics and John Goodmanson’s carb-loaded production. There isn’t any sort of ascertainable attitude adjustment or sonic restructuring to <i>No Blues</i> (Goodmanson and guitarist Tom Campesinos! co-produced), instead LC!’s inspiration sounds self-imposed, no different than looking at the mirror and realizing they’d gotten a little bloated and puffy.  </p>
<p><i>No Blues</i> has an unidentifiable ""something to prove,"" and nearly every song is superlative Los Campesinos! in some aspect. Rather than letting their energy splay out in all directions, LC! maintain a focus and unanimity that reinvigorates the band and should surprise people who may have checked out after <i>Romance is Boring</i>. With all seven members pushing in the same direction, the opening duo of “For Flotsam” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15952-los-campesinos-what-death-leaves-behind/"">“What Death Leaves Behind”</a> are as anthemic as LC!’s earliest work, though they achieve a kind of heretofore unimaginable liftoff—the call and response vocals merge into a unified front, the drums are huge. LC! have never sounded so muscular or crafted melodies as instantly memorable.  </p>
<p>The lyrics take after the music, given an outer focus and clarity that reveals their density, enlarged to show texture. Gareth’s vocals are still yelped, pleaded and spat, though there’s a brazen confidence in his delivery here, a mastery of craft. “A Portrait of the Trequartista as a Young Man” details Gareth’s goriest revenge fantasy (“I’d excavate his throat of voice/ and corrugate his vocal cords...make him recite this murder ballad”) while “Glue Me” is their most over-the-top mope (yes, more than the Smiths-baiting “Cemetery Gaits”), mixing the most poetically potent images with the silliest jokes (the heterograph of the title, a snarky misquote from <i>Titanic</i>). Bedecked with marching drums and welling horns, “The Time Before the Last Time” is the prettiest LC! song, though perversely so—it might <i>not</i> confirm a break up by masturbating in a girlfriend’s shower while fantasizing about her housemate, but I’m not sure what else it could be about.</p>
<p>Though he often presents himself as a drunken, cuckolded, and death-obsessed reprobate, Gareth performs like a leader of men, the gender pronoun being intentional as<i> No Blues</i> still mostly pertains to his obsession with sports and male sexual frustration (“flotsam, jetsam, and spindrift—all the girls I have loved”). The lyrics sheet sets out quite the scavenger hunt if you’re up for it—Capel Celyn, Dick Fosbury, the 2004 League Cup, Tony Yeboah, Meurig Park, and Delphinus all get their due. Most of the proper nouns are soccer references, which gives Gareth a distinct, entirely unique P.O.V. as a rock lyricist. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52688-echo-chamber-fucked-ups-damian-abraham-on-mainstream-indie/"" target=""_blank"">Indie still has a lot of hang-ups about being associated with the jocks</a>, but sports <i>fandom</i> allows for obscene levels of obsession and projection. I mean, why are we allowed to use movies and music and literature to tell our own stories to ourselves, but not the unscripted, all-too-human drama when it dredges up so much source material about masculinity, ambition, competitiveness, civic pride, friendship, and whether God is real? The namedropping isn’t meant to show Gareth’s cleverness, but to pinpoint extremely specific feelings that no one else is capable of capturing—go find out what a Panenka penalty is and listen to “Glue Me” again knowing how it feels to screw one of those up and then you’ll understand the indignity described therein.</p>
<p><i>No Blues</i> isn’t a promise, but rather a joke. On “As Lucerne (The Low)”, Gareth brags “there is no blues that could sound quite as heartfelt as mine” and further proves his point: “I hum the sorriest tune on the bar of these dives/ send all the patrons running home to make up with their first wives.” The parenthetical refers to the hook, which ostensibly sums up the expereince of being a Los Campesinos! fan—“the low is what I came for.” Yet, in a strange way, <i>No Blues</i> ends up sounding like the happiest LC! record, or at least the most implicitly hopeful. Sure, Gareth seems to be taking more joy than ever in crafting verbal monuments to his self-loathing. But after “Let It Spill” compares his eventual spiritual implosion to meteorological catastrophe and “The Time Before the Last Time”’s nihilistic, psychosexual closure comes “Selling Rope (Swan Dive To Estuary)”, where Gareth plunges off a bridge only to spend the descent realizing that the <i>act</i> is going completely unnoticed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Perhaps it’s a sign that there’s a limit to his miserablist exhibitionism? Maybe there's more to aspire to than simply having ""Sad Story"" as the only two words on his headstone (to quote ""Cemetery Gaits"")?  In a way, literally hitting bottom on ""Selling Rope"" means there's nowhere to go but up.

At 34, he’s a consummate dilettante, moving seamlessly from, say, inventing instrumental patches used in the score of the time-traveling sci-fi movie <i>Looper</i> to producing beats for <a href=""http://www.anticon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anticon</a> rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/312-beans"" target=""_blank"">Beans</a>. That’s the heady hip hop label that put out his first official pop album,<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11178-at-war-with-walls-mazes/"">At War With Walls &amp; Mazes</a></i>, a collage of organic and electronic samples matted together under Lott’s completely breakable voice. It took Lott almost four years to compile his debut, a process that came together while he was composing music for TV ads, all in the spirit of accidental curiosity. And four years is an eternity compared to his follow-up, the far more dense electro-chamber pop album <i>We Are Rising,</i> which he wrote over just 28 days in 2011 at the<a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2011/04/11/135206808/son-lux-chats-about-album-he-wrote-and-recorded-in-one-month"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> behest of NPR.</a></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In effect, </span><i>Lanterns</i><span> is the first Son Lux album made with an organic timeline and intention. It also happens to be a record of experimental music that strives to be something beyond just an experiment. Can flute trills actually live with an instrument built from Pro Tools? Can an arrhythmic baritone saxophone actually coexist with an 808 bass thump? For Son Lux, these aren't hypotheticals or theories scribbled into a notebook, these are the sounds of his native tongue and he wants to blend them all into a new language. <i>Lanterns </i>isn't piecemeal beats or hastily assembled clutter, rather it</span><span> begs to be heard as the lingua franca of the past and the future, something spoken on a pseudo-spiritual plane that connects the analog and digital realms. And sometimes it totally gets close.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's best to take in the wide-angle spirit of </span><i>Lanterns</i><span>, because Son Lux’s more than complex arrangements are always the highlight over his less than complex lyricism. When all his synapses are firing, he's conjuring something like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15967-son-lux-lost-it-to-trying/""><span>""Lost It To Trying""</span></a><span>, the maximalist hybrid chamber pop masterpiece at the front of the album. The song tethers itself to a jittery flute/saxophone riff, first found at the end of every few measures, but midway through it starts to overtake the whole song. By the end, there are hundreds of jittery flute/saxophone riffs spinning beneath, blurring together into a whole society of sound while a few choir voices and a theremin sample float far above. If ever there can exist sound that is singularly Son Lux, this is the type of all-in songwriting to get there.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The other way to this sweet spot is minimalism, heard on </span><i>Lanterns</i><span>’ other peerless track, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16110-easy/""><span>“Easy”</span></a><span>. If “Lost It To Trying” was the sound of two whole worlds speaking at the same time, “Easy” is just a few delegates from each. The timbre of Lott’s frail voice has a default setting of I'm Definitely Crying Right Now, so a few digital effects layered on puts it to better use as another texture. He warbles, “Pull out your heart to make the being alone easy” and it just slithers inside you undetected like the rest of the song. These two contrasting moments make up the lifeforce of the album, and most of the remaining seven tracks are too often just the notes the staff: brilliant ideas that lose their brilliance when they come off the page.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Compare <i>Lanterns </i>to one of it's more well known contemporaries, Sufjan Stevens’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14738-the-age-of-adz/""><i>Age Of Adz</i></a>. That's an album tuned to psychosis and schizophrenia, surreal dreams and outsider art. Its future/past dichotomy lives way out on the fringe and it drags you out there. <i>Lanterns </i>doesn’t have much in the way of surreality or gravity; instead it uses pat spirituality and repetitive hymnic platitudes as a cructh. It’s a pop album that doesn’t trust the simplicity of pop’s tenets. “No Crimes”, featuring a vocal turn by Peter Silberman of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27745-the-antlers/"" target=""_blank"">the Antlers</a>, fixates upon a similar sprinting, orchestral framework as “Lost It”, only it’s all climax with no plot to support it. “Pyre”, like “Easy”, looks for success in sparsity, but more heaves its dead weight around than vibrates in an ethereal plane.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-7b38d2b6-e270-9d73-8390-a4b6cad5344f"">It feels like Son Lux resents this world. Lott writes about leaving the ""wasting world behind"" to be transported, or more likely resurrected, in ""alternate worlds"" and when you can practically picture him winged, robed, and wearing a halo—He sings on the final track, ""I'll keep my lanterns lit."" He's like a painter who doesn't always trust that what he has on the canvas is complete. He tweaks his muted beats, or adds players from indie orchestra ringers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30072-ymusic/"" target=""_blank"">yMusic</a><span>—</span>who appear throughout, along with background vocals from<span> Darren King (Mutemath), Ieva Berberian (Gem Club) and Shara Worden (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4828-my-brightest-diamond/"" target=""_blank"">My Brightest Diamond</a>). </span>All the many collaborators are always ready with a fleck of flute or a spot of violin or another layer of angelic choir to obfuscate something simple. Conversely, there's not enough danger or adventure when Lott brings out his<a href=""https://www.theriteofspringat100.org/reflection/spring-encounters-bonus-edition-son-lux-rising/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> love of Stravinsky</a> or rap or electo-pop or maybe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45562-sufjan-stevens-teams-with-son-lux-and-rapper-serengeti-as-s-s-s-ep-due-on-anticon/"" target=""_blank"">some weird amalgum of all three</a>. It is hard to parse all that's disparate here, and in searching for its most personal form, Son Lux unwittingly dipped into the uncanny valley of digital music trying to become human<span>—</span>something a little too perfect to believe.</span></p></div>"|18639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18639-son-lux-lanterns/|6.6|Jeremy D.

Most recently she was the drummer for Best Coast, until a messy split (one on which she and frontwoman Bethany Cosentino <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44872-best-coasts-bethany-cosentino-responds-to-ali-koehler/"">publicly disagreed</a>); before that, she cut her teeth as <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30148-frankie-rose"">Frankie Rose</a>'s successor on drums in the ranks of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"">Vivian Girls</a>. The rest of the band has likewise been places: lead guitarist Jenn Prince is a Vivian Girls contemporary, too, one who plays guitar occasionally in ""Kickball"" Katy Goodman's side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29201-la-sera/"">La Sera</a>; and drummer Patty Schemel—well, the former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a> drummer needs little introduction.</p>
<p>So it's noteworthy that Upset, on their first full-length, with Koehler at the helm of her own ship, should rewind the clock. From its opening lines to its resolved close, <i>She's Gone</i> is a whirlwind of instantly likeable do-overs: uncomplicated, sticky-catchy pop punk songs about small-picture woes that place the trio squarely back into sprightly, if dissatisfied, teenaged bodies. With songs like opener ""Back to School"" and the simple-progressioned ""About Me"", it's as though Koehler hunted down a time machine to travel to the early 2000s, intent upon rewriting that era's commercial pop-punk history with some decidedly more DIY and feminist ethics. ""Queen Frosteen"", a simple song about adolescent female rivalry (""Queen Frosteen, my enemy/ She's everything, I'm nobody"") is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPPX6dZT0Vw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""If You C Jordan""</a> for the Rookie crowd; ""Never Wanna"" is a speedbagging lament about shy crushes that's equipped to handle New Found Glory crowds. The record's 36 minutes are the sugary product one would expect from a new Vivian Girl-meets-Hole experiment, with a spunky roughness around the edges that endears them—perhaps intentionally—to both a young crowd and one that could've used a record like this when<i> </i>they were the young crowd.</p>
<p>The sound of three well-vetted female musicians tearing through topics like rivals and drinking and following your dreams and kicking bad habits would, if they were coming from the band's male analogs, easily come off as manchild-y; at times these qualities do poke through Upset's scratchy tapestry. (Koehler and Prince are, after all, in their mid-20s; Schemel, whose powerful contributions to Upset originated in a Twitter-facilitated friendship with Koehler, is 46.) The set can feel a bit skeletal in its offerings, like a demo that got pushed through too quickly, and like the sugar rush of any pop punk, sometimes their dedication to the aesthetic loses its flavor—""Don't Lose Your Dinosaur"" is cute but waxes a bit saccharine in a Reading Rainbow, follow-your-dreams kind of way (""If it means that much to you/ Don't give up what you're meant to do,"" ""Don't lose your dinosaur/ 'Cause there's always more where that came from"")—but the immediacy of the subject matter seems more revisionist than immature.</p>
<p>All said,<i> She's Gone</i> is delightfully restless teenaged guitar-pop made by grown, well-traveled women, the contrast of which necessarily adds a sheen of introspection over the whole affair. Its depth impresses itself in spots like the deepened instrumental break on ""Phone Calls"", the album's most fleshed-out track, giving the album an intentionality that its contemporaries, both past and present, often lack. (It's fitting that Kyle Gilbride of comrades-in-pluck <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30624-swearin"">Swearin'</a> produced <i>She's Gone</i>, and that Don Giovanni Records would happily add it to their close-knit, youthful artillery of conscious punk.) The potential those moments bring is palpable, and that low-key maturity, the one that keeps <i>She's Gone</i> from being another delicious-yet-slapdash addition to an already replete base of teen angst, builds a platform from which the band will eventually and easily catch up with their adult selves.</p></div>"|18625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18625-upset-shes-gone/|7.2|Devon Maloney

But the noise metallurgists churn around one clear and inarguable point of darkness—vocal torturer Alan Dubin. <i>Horrible Chamber</i>, the band’s much-improved second album, starts without him. An out-of-tune piano plinks a diatonic melody ahead of and then in sync with a concussive electronic thud. It’s a chilly sound, sure, but it’s like waiting in line for a haunted house, where the anticipation of what’s <i>about </i>to come offers the true scare. When Dubin’s pitchy scream, stuck somewhere between a lupine howl and a serpentine hiss, cuts in after the 40-second prelude, you’re finally pushed through the front door. “Humming, humming, outside, outside, humming,” Dubin speak-screams slowly, splitting every word of his harangue with rests flooded by static and a sidecar of anxiety. “You left your window open, nice lady.” The next five minutes are purely repetitious, Dubin redelivering his lines in broken fragments and slipping briefly into talk of knife play. The band behind him controls the shock that surrounds the sound, like night watchmen looking out for the perpetrator and not the victim. It’s a point-of-view horror movie.</p>
<p>Dubin has done this before, of course. In the 90s, he was the singer of O.L.D., a collaboration with James Plotkin that specialized in weirdo, post-Patton industrial metal. And during the last decade, he infamously offered the curdled tone at the center of Khanate, the leaner and more terrorizing doom sideshow to member Stephen O’Malley’s drones in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>. But Gnaw released its 2009 debut, the nine-song fisticuffs <i>This Face</i>, a month after Khanate released its posthumous finale. The implication was clear: Gnaw was custom-built to harbor Dubin’s demented invective, to make his screams the bloody, bloodying star. By mixing jagged digital shards, relentless power electronics, piercing guitar amplifiers, and mid-tempo metal drums, Gnaw created a violent, volatile place for Dubin to work.</p>
<p>But <i>This Face </i>tried to do a bit too much at once, as though the band were overenthusiastic about its savage charge. The meld of heavy metal electrics and harsh noise electronics were sometimes nebulous, mostly causing the songs to feel more slight than scary. <i>Horrible Chamber</i> is more<i> </i>focused and deliberate, and the net effect is much more threatening. Dubin limns scenes of murder and decay (in both cases, his own and that of others), and the band not only paints the text with music to match but stands back far enough to let him work. During that gambit about the open window, the manipulated piano eventually starts to sound like wind chimes plinking together calmly and creepily while madness happens inside. Across its 10 minutes, “Widowkeeper” morphs slowly from a catacomb drone, where Dubin death-whispers about cold hands and rotting bodies above combative electronics, into a full-on doom torment, where the singer drags his beleaguered voice over broken guitar waveforms like a bag of bones. It’s a brilliant move that allows suspicion to become a visceral, terrifying reality. “Of Embers” is a tale of chest-beating, mad-eyed domination. “I bring the mist,” Dubin bellows at one point. “We’ll take this city, burn their beds,” he promises. The band pairs the ultimatums with what’s ultimately its most punishing metal—a grueling crawl across peak-and-valley drums and through hyper-distorted guitars. In the past, Gnaw might’ve crowded the action with tape hiss or effected malfeasance. But here, the squelchy din simply supports the roar rather than hamstring it. It’s more than a move of economy; Gnaw have gotten better at serving as Dubin’s vehicle of choice, at conveying the danger he means to share.   </p>
<p><i>Horrible Chamber </i>arrived in mid-October, just as plastic ghouls began to populate small-town storefronts and black-cat cutouts arrived in little front yards. Those fake boogeymen remind us annually of the horror of haunting and the tingle of danger. Gnaw get beyond all that, pushing their tirades and tales to the point where actual destruction seems just beyond the door. So much of that rests with Dubin, just as it has with every band he’s called his own. But this time, much of it rests with the band itself, too, which approaches Dubin’s rampages with newfound reserve and purpose. Gnaw might still lack the dramatic thrall and endless volume of Khanate, but they’ve begun to build themselves stepwise around a masterful instrument and centerpiece that no one else has. </p></div>"|18613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18613-gnaw-horrible-chamber/|7.4|Grayson Currin

This past Thursday, the band posted to Youtube an 85-minute video which cued up the entirety of the double-album to visuals from Marcel Camus' kaleidoscopic 1959 film <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053146/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1""><i>Black Orpheus</i></span></a>. If something that happens on the internet can be considered An Event, then this certainly was one; in the same moment I saw the band's official tweet announcing it, two people simultaneously instant-messaged me the link. It was late afternoon on the East Coast, lunchtime on the West, and in that moment I did exactly what thousands of other people in those and all other time zones did: Stopped what I was doing, closed some extraneous tabs and programs, and listened. The auto-updating comments became a chronicle of knee-jerk first impressions: fervent gushing (""The bassline on 'Joan of Arc' is fucking epic""), groan-worthy puns (""I can't even reflect how excited this makes me!""), and egregious misspellings (""I don't understand what all the fuzz is about""). This scene would have seemed bizarre—and likely a little sad— to us decades ago, and it's frightening to imagine how quaint it will seem in the future. But this is how a lot of people at this moment in time—the one in which <i>Reflektor</i> was made, and the one it distrustfully interrogates—discover new music: Alone; together.</p>
<p>All four of the Montreal-based band's albums have been about the tension between those two words, taking up subjects like suburban isolation and the false community of religiosity, but <i>Reflektor</i> is larger, at least in scope, than anything Arcade Fire have done before. Of course, the stakes have been raised considerably since we've last heard from them: Their previous album, <i>The Suburbs</i>, was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41559-arcade-fire-win-the-album-of-the-year-grammy/"" target=""_blank"">the unexpected winner of the Grammy for 2011's Album of the Year</a>. And yet, no one involved in this record sounds to be resting on the laurels of their achievements—that includes producer and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a> retiree <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5462-james-murphy/"" target=""_blank"">James Murphy</a>. <i>Reflektor</i> is a triumph, but not a victory lap; the band never sounds content enough for that.</p>
<p>This is instead an anxious, occasionally downright paranoid album that asks big, barbed questions aimed not just at the man who may or may not be upstairs, but the more terrestrial gods of rock history, too. With either Ziggy Stardust, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fly_(song)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Fly</a>, or maybe that first guy who played <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a> to the rock kids as their guide, Arcade Fire have spiked their usual clenched-fist earnestness with a small but welcome pinch of irony—and this is what makes it feel vital in a way that a lot of recent guitar-based music is not. ""Do you like rock'n'roll music?"" Butler asks in a mock-Elvis shudder at the beginning of glam-rock earthquake ""Normal Person"". ""Cuz I don't know if I do…"" The only way to make a Big Rock Record in 2013 is to make one that is skeptical of what it means to be a Big Rock Record in 2013.</p>
<p>On their last tour, the Arcade Fire played for the first time in Haiti, the country where vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Régine Chassagne's parents were born. Their time there served as the inspiration for <i>Reflektor</i>; Butler <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b039p7kr"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spoke</a> recently about the experience of playing for audiences who'd never heard many of the classic rock groups we take for granted, and instead ""connecting to people on a purely rhythmic, musical level…completely stripped of context."" You can hear the Caribbean influence in <i>Reflektor</i>'s emphasis on kinetic rhythms and deep grooves, but also in its somewhat irreverent attitude towards Anglo rock history. <i>Reflektor</i> is at once nostalgic for—its sense of sprawl feels like a throwback to the heyday of AOR—and iconoclastic about the past. It sounds like it has ingested a bunch of the great art-rock records you're ""supposed"" to learn to appreciate in your formative listening years—<i>Low, Remain in Light, Exile on Main Street, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13432-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">The White Album</a>, Here Come the Warm Jets</i>— and thrown them into the fire, in an attempt to make new shapes from the smoke.</p>
<p><i>Reflektor</i>'s sound is lush and imaginative, but never in a way that suffocates you with the fumes of its polish. It's limber and loose, as though the songs were performed live; the arrangements breathe, seethe, and sweat. As their detractors will be quick to point out, Arcade Fire's greatest crime in the past has been sometimes coming off too stately and self-serious (<i>The Suburbs</i> in particular had a buttoned-up quality that failed to capture the frenzied energy of their live shows), but on the first half of <i>Reflektor </i>they often feel like they're deflating their own sense of grandeur. It's nice to hear a band that showed up on the scene quite literally dressed for a funeral now sounding like they're having (at least a little) fun.</p>
<p>Goofy asides, unexpected left-turns, and tiny imperfections bring these songs to life: Check the odd, muttered phrases scattered throughout the intros, the parts on ""Normal Person"" when Tim Kingsbury's high E string seems to get clipped by the fretboard, or, maybe most thrillingly, the tempo fake-outs in ""Here Comes the Night Time"". That song, one of the album's best, begins with a celebratory Carnival beat, but then—the sonic equivalent to the tricks they've been playing in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52698-report-arcade-fire-play-new-tricks-in-brooklyn/"">recent concerts</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52726-watch-arcade-fire-perform-normal-person-and-afterlife-get-interviewed-by-stephen-on-the-colbert-report/"">TV performances</a>—suddenly switches to a slower, dub-inflected pace. There's a charming scrappiness to that moment as the band reorients to the rhythm, like a marching band suddenly realizing they're going the wrong way and trying, calamitously, to turn around.<br/><br/>There's always been a physicality about the Arcade Fire's sound—we're talking, after all, about a band whose members used to find it necessary to wear helmets on stage—but the rhythm section has never popped on one of their albums the way it does here. That emphasis has Murphy's stamp all over it (Butler says they all learned an important lesson early in the recording: ""If you can get James tapping his foot, you know you're on the right track""), and so do the punched-up backing vocals. This is the first Arcade Fire album on which Chassagne doesn't sing lead, but her crisp, smartly arranged harmonies on songs like ""Reflektor"", ""It's Never Over (Oh Orpheus)"", and ""Joan of Arc"" make her a major presence. (Same goes for Colin Stetson, who did the album's horn arrangements and whose uneasy bass sax is the title track's secret weapon.) Even <i>Reflektor</i>'s most straightforward pop songs like ""Joan of Arc"" and ""We Exist"" are fractured and haunted, reminiscent of the way <i>Achtung Baby</i> summoned the ghosts that had always been dormant in U2. When people talk about Murphy's production on <i>Reflektor</i>, the Eno comparisons will be obvious, unavoidable, and earned.</p>
<p><i>Reflektor</i> unfolds over two discs, and which you prefer will depend on how many packets of earnest magnificence you take in your Arcade Fire. Disc 1 is raw and grounded; Disc 2 is airier, more cosmic, and a little less self-aware. The record's most divisive song is the second half's centerpiece, ""Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)"", which—<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445922/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Julie Taymor style</a>—aims to be nothing less than all the Beatles songs at once (""Hey Jude""<i> and</i> ""Revolution 9"" included). It inevitably falls short, but it's hard not to admire the effort. Lyrically if not sonically, the album's weakest link is the slinky ""Porno"", whose heavy-handed lyrics (""Take the make-up off your eyes…Little boys with their porno/ They don't know what we know"") feel a bit too much like bleeding-heart teenage poetry. And yet, even if the shoulda-been-B-side ""Porno"" feels like a lapse in judgment, it springs from the same source that helps the band continue to be so vital. Arcade Fire <i>are</i> eternal, defiantly emotive teenagers, and that's what kept them sounding like genuine underdogs even as they've become one of the biggest bands in the world. Nearly a decade after <i>Funeral</i>, Butler still sings like everything is at stake. For this band, growing up has not meant cooling the flames so much as beckoning them higher. The figures at the center of the Side 2 suite of ""Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)"" and the wonderfully Cocteau-glacial ""It's Never Over (Oh Orpheus)"" are not the Springsteenian everypeople of <i>Funeral </i>and <i>Neon Bible</i>, but instead the star-crossed lovers in a Greek myth.</p>
<p>And yet, even on Disc 2 it's hard to shake the feeling that Orpheus and Eurydice are just the B-plot; the great love story on <i>Reflektor</i> is the one between music and listener. With its clipped snippets of airwave chatter (the BBC's Jonathan Ross makes a cameo), warped VHS hum, and retro-luminosity that nods to a time when synthesizers connoted un-jaded wonder and revelation, <i>Reflektor</i> is designed to be an homage to the many ways music is transmitted, discovered, and incorporated into people's lives. Chassagne has said that her earliest and most stirring musical memories were ""listening to [her] neighbor's music, the sounds coming through the walls"" and then trying to replicate them on piano; in the <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-unstoppable-ambition-of-arcade-fire-20110214"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">same interview</a>, the Texas-born Butler spoke similarly about U2's (much maligned) Pop Mart tour. <i>Reflektor</i>'s scope is vast enough that it speaks to both of these experiences—and to our own. In the end, it doesn't feel like a critique of this screen-glazed moment so much as a validation of it. They've given us something in the present tense that, these days, feels depressingly unfashionable: An Event—an album that dares to be great, and remarkably succeeds.</p></div>"|18667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18667-arcade-fire-reflektor/|9.2|Lindsay Zoladz

Often the duo of Rob Brown and Sean Booth have used the format to extend on the knotty ideas of whatever their latest LP happened to be at the time, although the results are not always concise. The runtime for the download-only EP <i>Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae</i> is around the 150-minute mark. On 1994's <i>Anti</i> EP  they even took a political stance, using their music to protest the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which was passed in the U.K. as a measure to curb the ""repetitive beats"" of illegal raves. Autechre's response was to program a series of non-repetitive beats across the track ""Flutter"".</p>
<p>The music on their EPs isn't always typical of their career, but it does highlight how the format has afforded Brown and Booth room to edge away from the dense constructs that consume their time elsewhere. The sheer amount of music on this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17691-autechre-exai/""><i>Exai</i></a> can seem daunting at first, even for Autechre fans who are reasonably comfortable with every turn they've taken. Long albums are rarely an instant thrill, but for this duo even single tracks can take a vast amount of time to unravel. It's one of the most beautiful aspects of Autechre, whose music still sounds like it's being beamed back to us from some impossibly brutal future, but a future that's actively working against the short-attention-span present.</p>
<p><i>L-event</i> isn’t a world away from the <i>Exai</i> material. It's not passive listening. Autechre work operates at a high level of engagement, requiring a commitment from the listener that's as great as the detail poured into the music. That holds true across their output, and only seems to increase with each passing record. Here, all the edges are a little sharper, although the level of decay has decreased since the collapsed-world framework they set up for 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11245-quaristice/""><i>Quaristice</i></a>. The standout ""Newbound"" from this EP links to the same kind of duality felt in the excellent <i>Exai</i> cut ""Bladelores"", where hope and futility battle against one another. It's in that kind of suggestion that the best Autechre material works, where the haywire circuitry gradually unravels with a strange kind of purpose.</p>
<p>Not all of <i>L-event</i> is quite so rewarding. ""Osla for n"" comes closest to payoff, initially resembling an asthmatic computer descending into delirium before the ideas tail off before the end. If <i>Exai</i> needed editing it was in the individual track lengths as opposed to the overall work. ""Osla for n"" follows the pattern set by a track like ""veKoS"" from that album, where the focus begins to slip by the middle and then drifts into aimless contemplation. At least on ""tac Lacora"" they demonstrate how well they can still transform their overriding preoccupation with digital interference into sound, although there is a creeping sense that Brown and Booth are looping back on themselves, returning to ground they've already covered in abundance. Still, they remain lone operators out here, <a href=""http://p.autechre.ws/proxy?lnk=pitchfork.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">liquefying the internet</a> one website at a time, continually enamored with the breaking point of technology.</p></div>"|18672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18672-autechre-l-event-ep/|6.4|Nick Neyland

As any of the handful of artists who've done it recently will attest, that the band (Audacity, but also its members' previous incarnations—Nontoxic, the Plaid, the Attachments) has been whacking away at its bratty garage rock for nearly a decade, slogging through their often-sceneless pocket of Orange County, eventually finding a home with the likeminded Burger Records guys (at the time they were just the band Thee Makeout Party!), releasing what seem like countless EPs and 7""'s, and building a community in the meantime, is certainly not an accomplishment to sneeze at.</p>
<p>That nine-year slosh has brought them to their third full-length <i>Butter Knife</i>. With this new record, Audacity prove two things. First, that they've perfected the art of the party-rock anthem. They're impressively dutiful students of the genre, to the point where their music is built from the sum of its forbears: There's the endless, stereotypical taunts and judgments of those who've left their circle: ""Are you ashamed you turned into a square?"" vocalists Kyle Andrew Gibson and Matt Schmalfeld cry, typically, on ""Hole in the Sky"". There's a worried-about-growing-up emo throwback in closer ""Autumn"", with the line ""How many stars should I wish upon tonight?/ How many stars are in the sky tonight?"" ""Rooster"", the mid-record tempo-kill, takes on a whiny Weezer hue, while ""Pick Slide"", the album's second shortest track, is Hives-esque. Strains of Atlanta's Black Lips and even a smidgen of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1204-descendents/"" target=""_blank"">Descendents</a>' nasty kiditude are loomingly present throughout. There's rarely a somber moment—even the slow songs can't help but pick up toward the end—because that's the point: tear through adolescence as joyfully and stubbornly as possible, pausing only briefly to consider self-reflection. <i>Butter Knife</i>, like any of Audacity's records, is pretty clear on what it's here for, and what it's not.</p>
<p>The other thing the band proves with it, however, is that there's only so far one can take that deftly honed identity, the one that exists within a niche that's already established its own limits. Where songcraft makes the quartet technically proficient garage rockers, their personality is hard to distinguish from their local peers; one could replace mentions of FIDLAR<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17559-fidlar/""> in a review of <i>FIDLAR</i></a> with ""Audacity"" and not get the wrong idea. <i>Butter Knife</i> is a demonstration they've conducted before, too; last July's <i>Mellow Cruisers</i>, released via Burger and Recess Records,<i> </i>essentially accomplished the same task in three fewer songs. Songs bleed into each other, and 36 minutes begin to feel like 50. (Shouldn't punchy, scratchy punk records feel like they're slapping you in the face and running away, egging you onto the next house show?) Where roiling, basement-shaking jams about the Orange County bum-around life can compel audiences to crash into one another, sweaty and grinning, they have a tendency to become white noise when shoved together on a full-length record, especially one with the polished sound of a bigger production budget, and released into a sea of albums that are already holding their own house parties, simultaneously, all over the country.</p>
<p>Combine all of that with the fact that Audacity have already reissued two EPs this year and released another quite similar LP 15 months ago, and you've got yourself a perfect, forgettable storm of sunshine rock. And while this doesn't necessarily apply to the appetite of Audacity's audience—few scenes are more consistently dedicated to each other, musically and otherwise, than the plucky skater-bro slack-rock crowd—it does tend to caricaturize and flatten them in a recording context. They become Punk Muzak: the creative stall of playing to form and having little else to add outside of live performance that easily kills the fun of sun-drenched, bratty Peter Pan mantras upon takeaway—an interminable state of arrested development, crystallized in mp3. This is how records for scenes like this eventually become tokens, short-run memorabilia that exist to prove the experience was real.</p></div>"|18619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18619-audacity-butter-knife/|6.0|Devon Maloney

Since the release of their second album, 2008’s <i>Laulu Laakson Kukista</i>, Paavoharju have apparently been taking the concept of “woodshedding” to a logical extreme. Their latest album <i>Joko sinä tulet tänne alas tai minä nousen sinne </i>was conceived and recorded in a variety of abandoned buildings, including in a self-built sauna deep in the Tattarisuo swamp that might be reasonably described as a literal shed in the woods. The resulting album is every bit as atmospheric and inscrutable as that process might suggest.</p>
<p>As with their previous work, Paavoharju’s music on <i>Joko</i> is a mass of internal contradictions and counter-intuitive decisions. Though the group is still typically described in the press as a collective, the bulk of the music is composed and assembled in solitude by Lauri Ainala. The exact process is likely known only to Ainala himself, but most of the music here is a dense weave of submerged tape loops, crackly field recordings, and disembodied snippets of voice and shadowy instruments. The ground shifts continually beneath the listener’s feet as the various sound elements emerge and are allowed to decay and dissolve into one another. The sense of dissolution is broken by waves of casual synchronicity, leaving an impression similar to that of tuning your dashboard AM radio to a crowded spot on the dial where traces of multiple distant broadcasts intersect to create spontaneous new compositions.</p>
<p>The biggest change this time is that here one of those distant AM stations is broadcasting an alien strain of hip-hop. Finnish rapper Paperi T, of the Helsinki group Ruger Hauer, makes several appearances throughout the album. His rap and/or spoken word contributions are purposefully de-contextualized, removed entirely from any urban origin and forcibly transplanted into Paavoharju’s disorienting landscapes. It adds an interesting wrinkle to the group’s formula, although I’d be hard-pressed to declare it an actual improvement. At the very least, Paperi T’s presence ensures that this is Paavoharju’s most lyrically-dense music to date, something that is an obvious obstacle for listeners who speak no Finnish. In this environment, his vocals can’t help but take on something of a theatrical appearance, calling to mind something like a Finnish version of Mike Patton and somewhat diminishing the album’s general out-of-time quality.</p>
<p><i>Joko sinä tulet tänne alas tai minä nousen sinne </i>translates roughly to “Either you come down here, or I will ascend there.” According to <a href=""http://www.examiner.com/article/take-five-an-interview-with-paavoharju"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview</a>, Paavoharju borrowed that title from a quote by Tampa-based evangelical minister <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EkQQYHpNLM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rodney Howard-Browne</a>. As with their use of hip-hop, Paavoharju’s re-contextualization of this quote indicates their canny ability to blend their seemingly insular musical vision with a global array of influences. Or perhaps it might be more precise to say a <i>universal</i> array of influences—throughout these pieces there exist layers of wordless vocal samples that are not readily traceable to any one cultural source, some of them so disquieting it can feel almost like listening to <a href=""%5Bhttp://www.ubu.com/sound/occult.html"" target=""_blank"">EVPs or other paranormal field recordings</a>.</p>
<p>At their best, as on such tracks as “Kolmas Voima” (“Third Force”) or “Valkeat Majat” (“White Tents”), Paavoharju are able to conduct tricks of memory similar to those triggered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15518-an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world/"" target=""_blank"">the Caretaker</a> or the artists on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/through-the-cracks/6854-through-the-cracks-5/"" target=""_blank"">the Ghost Box roster</a>. Obscure musical elements, spectral voices, and stray bits of traditional Finnish song and folklore are combined to create works that can seem at once deeply alien and yet tantalizingly familiar. In the end the album's most intriguing paradox is the way Paavoharju are able to juxtapose so many noises and ideas against one another that it reaches a point where these collisions cease to be jarring at all, creating instead an immersive environment ready to be explored again and again.</p></div>"|18682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18682-paavoharju-joko-sina-tulet-tanne-alas-tai-mina-nousen-sinne/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

The quintet's sophomore album <i>The White Goddess (A Grammar of Poetic Myth)</i> is huge, and the band’s epic take on traditional metal—tempered with a solid dash of traditional doom and all-around ornate craftsmanship—has the potential to crossover into plenty of other heavy realms.</p>
<p>For example, the opening riff on instrumental “Trumpets of Doggerland” gallops straight out of Swedish one-man band Bathory's 1990 classic <i>Hammerheart</i>, even echoing the wave sounds of “Shores in Flames”. Shades of the Viking metal that characterized Bathory’s mid-to-late period color much of <i>The White Goddess</i> (check out “Enthroned in Clouds and Fire” for the best <i>Twilight of the Gods</i> riff that never was). There are few other bands save for the Swedish trio Ereb Altor who pay such excellent tribute to Quorthon’s melancholic melodies, but Atlantean Kodex don’t just stop there. They've expanded an already broad palette to include swaths of classic Candlemass and even the loinclothed metal kings themselves, Manowar. (The triumphant chorus to “Sol Invictus” is as stirring as anything Joey DeMaio’s written since <i>Kings of Metal</i>, and that’s just the second track.) Hints of While Heaven Wept and Manilla Road make a few spiritual cameos, too, and the end result is intoxicating, something they’ve been leading up to since their well-regarded breakthrough, 2011’s <i>The Golden Bough</i>.</p>
<p><i>The White Goddess</i> spans nearly an hour and features three long songs (plus one “short” eight-minute track), bookended by instrumental interludes. There's a lot of material to digest, but great care's been taken to mix up tempos and moods: Introduced by gloomy near-acoustic interlude “Der Untergang der Stadt Passau”, a stately ode like the aforementioned “Enthroned in Clouds and Fire” segues into the soul-stirring album closer “White Goddess Unveiled” and a gentle piano outro. The soaring centerpiece “Heresiarch” is maybe the best representation of Atlantean Kodex in a nutshell (well, 11 minutes) and tells a particularly dark tale.</p>
<p>There's a beautiful richness to the album, lyrically and musically. The stories are carefully woven, acting as a continuation of the ecclesiastical and magical themes of <i>The Golden Bough</i>. While fist-pumping heavy metal abounds and fantasy reigns free, there's a studied seriousness about the songwriting that ensures headbangers will leave with more than just a sore neck. The album hinges upon a greater narrative of the rise and fall of Europe, with references to Greek mythology butting up against Christian dogma and colorful metaphors: A white bull races across the sea, while fair Europa’s fate hangs in the balance and the Goat of a Thousand Young keeps watch over a virginborn child. “When the seven suns align, down the onyx steps he strides/ Roaming alone in black aether, looking for antediluvian knowledge/ Written in the kodex of Atalant forlorn” ain’t exactly “Denim and leather, brings us all together.”</p>
<p>Heavy metal’s got plenty of time for its slogans, of course, but it’s refreshing to see such a dedicated commitment to offering something deeper. For lyrically-heavy bands like this, the vocal performance tends to make or break the album. Luckily for Atlantean Kodex, they’ve got Markus Becker. His voice lacks the maudlin qualities of pure doom or histrionic bombast of power metal, though it’s clear he takes influences from both: His strong, clear tone hits that oh-so-effective sweet spot, balancing power, pomp, and prowess.</p>
<p>The Churchill quotes sprinkled throughout reinforce the grandiosity of it all. “If Europe were once united in the sharing of its common inheritance, there would be no limit to the happiness, to the prosperity and the glory which its three or four million people would enjoy,” is how he put it at the opening of his 1946 speech in Zurich, and so he says once more as “Twelve Stars and an Azure Gown” begins its slow, solemn descent. The song itself reflects the band’s greater focus on a heavier, more doom-oriented sound, one that suits the weight of the material as much as the airy production that allows it room to breathe. This latest album isn't a great departure from its predecessor, but Atlantean Kodex have grown and matured. There’s no telling how much they'll continue to improve and perfect, but given the heights they’ve reached with <i>The White Goddess</i>, the sky’s the limit.</p></div>"|18543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18543-atlantean-kodex-the-white-goddess-a-grammar-of-poetic-myth/|8.0|Kim Kelly

Pretty much the utmost qualities you’d want out of a human being, right? Those descriptors are certainly less trustworthy when applied to art, as they’re often considered the byproducts of complacency, or at least a warning sign. Whenever a band comes along that people tell you is “necessary,"" they’re probably ripping shit up, telling you what to think, espousing conflict against music and listeners that got a little too comfy. Mutual Benefit isn’t revolutionary and <i>Love’s Crushing Diamond </i>is not going to judge you. But in no way is Jordan Lee a complacent songwriter. In fact, throughout this collection of seven gorgeous, baroque-folk songs, he’s dealing in perhaps the most pervasive and difficult internal battle of all: how can you be a loving, patient, warmhearted and unfailingly hopeful person in an environment that makes it far easier to not give a shit?</p>
<p>A good start is to surround yourself with fellow <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=tF6giSBifqYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">warriors of the meek</a>—Mutual Benefit brings to mind the “collective” format, “Animal” or otherwise, that played a large role in defining the tone of indie rock during the early 2000s. Think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2756-the-microphones/"">Microphones</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3902-sparklehorse/"">Sparklehorse</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1007-danielson-famile"">Danielson Famile</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/236-akronfamily"">Akron/Family</a>, early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens"">Sufjan Stevens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"">Devendra Banhart</a>, where an open-ended “band” surrounds a central voice seeking to explore the ideas of what “folk” or roots music really means. Mutual Benefit certainly qualifies, though not in the way that equates “folk” with rusticity, an acoustic guitar and rigid verse-chorus structure. Songs invariably rise out of twenty or so seconds of everyone getting situated, tapping out piano riffs, trying to get the percussion in rhythm and determining who’s going to sing. From there on out, there’s often contain one central melody and a clearly elucidated mood that spools throughout, while the arrangements are surprising and intuitive, like everyone involved might be swapping instruments as it goes along.</p>
<p>The sound here is proudly analog, though not lo-fi, and Lee’s songs are thick, but not dense. Beginning with his lightly enunciated vocals, soft strands are collected and continuously bundled throughout and nuzzled by reverb without being smothered by it, a big ball of sonic yarn to fall into. Some curious threads peek through to add a shock of color: the banjo lacing Lee’s awestruck infatuation on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16182-advanced-falconry/"">“Advanced Falconry”</a>, household percussion clacking throughout “‘Let’s Play’/Statue of a Man”, gentle, female harmonies and a steady drum machine tick lending comfort to a wayward drug addict on “That Light That's Blinding” and an indeterminate synthesized instrument playing the glowing riff that explains the title of “Golden Wake.""</p>
<p>On that particular song, a riverside meditation leads Lee to quitting his job and realizing “we weren’t made to be afraid.” That’s a major part of the plot engine in cubicle revenge fantasy <i>Office Space</i>and a motivating thread throughout the majority of chillwave, another genre thought to be a reaction to an increasingly hostile and hopeless time for socioeconomics. But<i> Love’s Crushing Diamond</i> is not folk in the escapist sense either, though it was recorded during a “year of notable absences” in San Diego, Austin and Boston. Many of these songs take place in mundane, unglamorous locales—city trains, mining towns, cornfields, motel rooms. And in Lee's point of view, you need to discover a little space within those places that you can call your own and then invite some people to share it with. Yeah, it does skew kinda hippie, as Lee’s lyrics detail picking roses by the lake and how a river can’t help but keep on keepin’ on. That’s perfectly fine within the scheme of <i>Love’s Crushing Diamond, </i>which always sounds <i>populated</i> in a way that stresses its central themes of getting your own shit together so you’re better prepared to care for someone else.</p>
<p>This kind of perspective gives Mutual Benefit an unintended timeliness as well. As much as you want to consider music objectively, without some kind of sociological context, think of it this way: when Sufjan, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Animal Collective</a> and freak-folk came about, any afterglow of post-9/11 togetherness had given way to a terribly divisive and dirty presidential election, an escalating, vaguely defined war and a general sense that the country was being bullied into submission from the inside. This sort of music would inevitably be criticized for being apolitical and <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2007/10/22/071022crmu_music_frerejones"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">wimpy</a>, but having seen where all this aggression got us, how could <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window""><i>Sung Tongs</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/553-cripple-crow/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window""><i>Cripple Crow</i></a> not seem like the solution?</p>
<p><i>Love’s Crushing Diamond</i> works in a similar way and opens itself up to some of the same criticisms, when being positive is the quickest way to have your sincerity questioned. Lee concedes these points without giving in, and makes the case that kindness is in no way a sign of weakness: <i>Diamond</i>’s seven-minute, closing reverie “Strong Swimmer” acknowledges that it takes an Olympian level of strength to swim against the tide of negativity, but it’s the only choice. During “‘Let’s Play/Statue of a Man,” Lee sings “There’s always love/when you think there’s none to give”, true whether it’s “tattered, strained or torn.” I can’t think of a statement that sounds more necessary.</p></div>"|18669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18669-mutual-benefit-loves-crushing-diamond/|8.4|Ian Cohen

But <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27844-omar-souleyman/"" target=""_blank"">Omar Souleyman</a>’s <i>Wenu Wenu</i> is in fact technically his first proper recording, having been cut in a studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn rather than on site at one of the thousands of weddings he’s performed over the past two decades around his home in northern Syria, where his reputation as a performer par excellence once drove an entire economy of bootleg cassette recordings.</p>
<p>Souleyman’s milieu is dabke, a style of folk dance music found at social gatherings across large swaths of the Middle East, built around intricately filigreed instrumental leads, <span>exhortative singing, and pounding, trance-inducing rhythms. It’s an old style, but in recent years it’s had a creative renaissance as dabke artists, realizing that the form shares structural similarities with Western electronic dance music, began incorporating synthesizers and four-on-the-floor drum machines into their compositions.</span></p>
<p>While many of them have used the possibilities that electronic instruments offer to build epically rococo arrangements, Souleyman’s take on dabke is almost brutalist in its simplicity. Live, and on the five LPs of material he’s released through the American ethnographic music label <a href=""http://www.sublimefrequencies.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sublime Frequencies</a>, the music is performed by Souleyman and his accompanists Ali Shaker (electric saz) and Rizan Sa'id. Sa'id plays dense bursts of melody on a synthesizer emulating traditional reed sounds over a relentless beat, and with Souleyman’s inimitable quavering bark laid over them, the entire mix is overdriven to a point you more commonly encounter with punk bands.</p>
<p>This combination of vivid minimalism and in-the-red performance is as essential to his popularity with Western avant garde audiences as his striking uniform of white thawb, red keffiyeh, and aviator shades, which adds a retro ABSCAM visual flair and produces an interesting aesthetic frisson when combined with the music’s techno-futuristic glare. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1548-kieran-hebden/"" target=""_blank"">Kieran Hebden</a>, who produced <i>Wenu Wenu</i>, made the wise decision not to try and improve on a sound that doesn’t need fixing. </p>
<p><i>Wenu Wenu</i> succeeds at capturing the hypnotic energy of Souleyman’s incredible live performances, but backs off the overdriven sonics to give the music newfound room to breathe. In the process we can finally appreciate some of the nuances in Sa’id’s playing, like the funky inflections in his basslines and the finger rolls sequenced into his drum patterns. Hearing the keyboards more clearly also gives the sound more stylistic flexibility. Synthy horn stabs in the earwormy titular opening track evoke 80s and 90s club pop, while the ersatz strings and fretless bass in the midtempo “Khattaba” add a not unwelcome layer of glossy schmaltz to the mix.</p>
<p>While some of those choices in synth patches were undoubtedly Hebden’s, they’re never obvious. There are touches here and there—the subtle modulated delay on a synthesizer lead, the odd filter sweep—where his participation comes through, but it never sounds like he’s trying to make <i>Wenu Wenu</i> a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> album, or make Souleyman fit the parameters of Western dance music or, god forbid, sound fashionable.</p>
<p>Still, the music here can compete against any kind of dance music being made right now, and succeed. Dabke lives or dies by its ability to make people move, and although Souleyman is no-frills, and borderline gruff compared to other dabke performers, there’s something in his stentorian singing that’s irresistible. It’s still best experienced live, but after 20 years of mostly bootleg-quality tapes, there’s finally a recording worthy of calling the next best thing.</p></div>"|18665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18665-omar-souleyman-wenu-wenu/|7.2|Miles Raymer

If you were around then, it's interesting watching what has and hasn't made it in the 2013 translation. There are bands from the 90s people still think about, and that have been canonized, but there were also groups who made great music and then disappeared. I'm thinking of acts that felt big at the time, but remain footnotes a decade and change later—the Grifters, Some Velvet Sidewalk, Kicking Giant, Steel Pole Bath Tub, etc. One of the biggest bands in this regard is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4427-unwound/"" target=""_blank"">Unwound</a>. You can hear their approach in any number of noisy post-punk and punk acts with deep record collections, but more often than not, folks don't know where those sounds came from.</p>
<p>Along with noisy bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2267-karp/"" target=""_blank"">Karp</a> and Lync that were associated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2200-calvin-johnson/"" target=""_blank"">Calvin Johnson</a> and that Olympia ""love rock"" scene, Unwound would have made more sense on Dischord if they weren't from the Pacific Northwest. And their music did feel very much situated in that pine-scented space. They were a part of the Pacific Northwest that was happening around the time of Nirvana and sometimes overlapped with it, but one that ultimately went in a very different direction.</p>
<p>The Tumwater, Wash., trio were powerful, and at the time, they seemed towering—only later did you realize they were about as ""huge"" as an underground punk group on a then small, nascent indie label could get before people used the internet. (Unwound released the first proper, non-compilation full-length on Kill Rock Stars—1993's <i>Fake Train</i>—which is not something that registered at the time, because you had no idea what KRS would become.) ""Huge"" also meant something different then because you never imagined the bands you listened to would graduate to anything beyond small all-ages shows, and they rarely did. These were the sorts of the bands who played their local independent record stores, basements, and DIY spots, but could also go on tours and sell out venues in other cities. In some circles Unwound were regarded as heroes, but a dozen years after their breakup, people still seem to know them more by name than their music.</p>
<p>That could change: Numero Group, who handled the similarly necessary<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16766-frigid-stars-barely-real-ep-the-white-birch/"" target=""_blank""> Codeine reissues</a> last year, are in the midst of an epic undertaking, reissuing all of Unwound's albums in box sets on limited vinyl (and as digital downloads) with a ton of rarities. They just put out the first installment, <i>Kid Is Gone</i>, covering the period leading up to <i>Fake Train</i>. The second pairs <i>Fake Train</i> with 1994's <i>New Plastic Ideas</i>. (Vol. 3 is reportedly 1995's <i>The Future of What?</i> and 1996 fan favorite <i>Repetition</i>; the series closes with Vol. 4, 1998's somewhat spotty <i>Challenge for a Civilized Society</i> and 2001's post-punk/noise-rock classic <i>Leaves Turn Inside You</i>).</p>
<p>Unwound's recorded output has a chaotic beauty and energy to it; live, they always felt like they were on the verge of falling apart, and sometimes they did: I remember driving to see them in Philadelphia at one point and they had to stop the show after Sara Lund broke her bass drum pedal. I have a memory of her trying to tape it back together and finally calling it a day, and it was a fitting image: their music as being held together with duct tape. As someone who loves Unwound's earliest stuff, and that gnarled live presence, this first volume is especially interesting.</p>
<p>Spread across three LPs, <i>Kid Is Gone</i> gathers the rougher, noisier, rawer, punkier Unwound, the period where they changed their name from Giant Henry to Supertanker to Cygnus X-1 and started finding their way. (Unwound always remained all of the above, but they refined elements and added others that aren't here yet.) This is the material with original drummer Brandt Sandeno, who quit in 1992 and was replaced in July of that year by Sara Lund, who was a friend of Kill Rock Stars founder Slim Moon and the band had met when she took a photo of them for the back cover of the 1991 Caterpillar 7"". The band I knew best was the one with her in it, but it's great hearing vocalist/guitarist Justin Trosper, bassist Vern Rumsey (who ran the great Punk in My Vitamins label), and Sandeno figuring things out.</p>
<p>On the first record, <i>Caterpillar</i>, you get the seven songs from their 1991 cassette <i>Bionic</i>, the excellent aforementioned three-song Caterpillar 7"" released by Kill Rock Stars, and the track from the seminal 1991 <i>Kill Rock Stars</i> compilation (the Calvin Johnson-recorded ""You Speak Jealousy""), which is where you really start to hear a new, more unique, disengaged vocal approach, even if Johnson put Trosper too far upfront in the mix. (That voice, usually more buried, is also there on ""Caterpillar"", and you get a sense of what'll happen next, sonically, with the transistor squelches and drifts of the instrumental ""Crab Nebula"".)</p>
<p>The second disc, <i>Unwound</i>, features the self-titled album, which was recorded in 1992 and not released until 1995, along with the 1993 self-titled Gravity 7"" and the previously unreleased momentum-building instrumentals ""I'd Die to Know You"" and ""Sugarfit"", which were both recorded with Steve Fisk in 1992. Both are cool, though not essential. On this record, the math-y, brainy post-punk Unwound starts to emerge more clearly with songs like the jittery, grooving ""Rising Blood"", the moody, downcast, throat-sick ""Fingertips"", and via the extended Sonic Youth guitar squalls of ""You Bite My Tongue"". You also get their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a> side on ""Warmth"" and their more rabid math via ""Kid is Gone"" and rabid feedback via the early classic, ""Kandy Korn Rituals"".</p>
<p>The third disc, <i>Chant of Vengeance</i>, contains previously unissued KAOS radio material (which comes complete with bad college radio banter, something that will never go away, and is nice to hear situated next to the Unwound tracks) and the stuff one Damon Houk recorded live in his basement, including the take on ""Hating in D"" that appears as the last track on the 1993 Kandy Korn Rituals 7"". This is one of those reissues where you'll get multiple versions of the same tracks when you factor in the live takes and the radio material. That, and some of the songs appeared on <i>A Single History: 1991–1997</i>, which was released in 1999 by Kill Rock Stars.</p>
<p>The set also contains unreleased photos, and the liners notes are extensive—you'll know more about the early days of Unwound than their parents. You get that history of the band from the early years, under their earlier names, but it grows more interesting when they start to gel as Unwound, especially the material surrounding that <i>Kill Rocks Stars</i> compilation, which also included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a> among other key acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"" target=""_blank"">Bikini Kill</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/459-bratmobile/"" target=""_blank"">Bratmobile</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2726-mecca-normal/"" target=""_blank"">Mecca Normal</a>, and was released shortly before <i>Nevermind</i> broke through.  </p>
<p>It makes sense that Numero anticipate six to seven months between each release in this reissue series—it ought to give listeners time to digest the material before moving onto the next batch. Unwound were a band who changed a lot during their time together, but never lost the plot; while there is this cohesion, the shifts also make more sense, and ultimately will mean more, if these boxes are experienced in something closer to ""real time."" This was a real band, a group of friends who played music because they wanted to play music. A band with ideals when ideals were about what you did in private, and not just about playing a character in the press. They may not have made the history books yet, but Unwound definitely deserve to be there when someone starts writing the second volumes.</p></div>"|18356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18356-unwound-kid-is-gone/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

That’s the question that hangs highest at the close of <i>Milk Money</i>, the first album in three years from solo multi-instrumentalist, one-man loop station and Andrew Bird drummer Martin Dosh. Dosh begins with six slight and impressionistic pieces, each stopping not only well short of the five-minute mark but of any real peak, too. “Golden Silver”, for instance, slow-fades from a cool-blooded thicket of sighing organs, twinkling pianos, and thudding drums, evacuating its own oxygen before any eruption can occur. “Death Set” is not nearly as dangerous or foreboding as its name implies, with wild runs on multiple keyboards and stepwise sequences of bass simply folding in and out of a jungle beat until that pulse is all that remains.</p>
<p>But the final track, “Legos (for Terry)”, is the most ambitious and most surprising moment of Dosh’s entire repertoire. Just shy of 25 minutes, “Legos” is not only longer than the sum of the rest of the album’s parts but also longer than anything else in his back catalog by more than double. This isn’t an exercise in simply going an indeterminate distance, though: Dosh wrote “Legos” as a commission for the Walker Arts Center in his homebase of Minneapolis, Minn., to be played as a duet with Glenn Kotche on the night of the Wilco drummer’s premiere of<a href=""http://thethread.dukeperformances.duke.edu/2013/02/interview-elemental-composer-john-luther-adams-on-glenn-kotche-ilimaq/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> his John Luther Adams collaboration, <i>Ilimaq</i>.</a> It’s a grand, arching composition that moves between two monolithic sections with just the right balance between restraint and restlessness.</p>
<p>Though Dosh<a href=""http://www.walkerart.org/magazine/2013/talking-drums-glenn-kotche-and-martin-dosh"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> has sold his own piano playing short in the past</a>, he summons Keith Jarrett during the first span, scattering bursts and slipstreams of notes between refracted vocal samples and a chiffon layer of static. It’s a phosphorescent dawn. Dosh’s original take lasted nearly twice as long as the album version and featured no vocals, but the sampled-and-splintered utterances here help introduce the song’s second half, a crisscrossing wonder of kalimba and piano, hi-hat and synthesizers. Their melodies and rhythms shift in and around one another like a Steve Reich epic on vacation, exciting and electric. Dosh micromanages the elements as the piece progresses—steadily boosting the background hum, wildly stringing together the vocal bits, carefully digging into the beat a bit heavier and hotter. When all those components tumble around one another, with vocals crashing against drums against electronics, the feeling is ecstatic, as though the composer-performer has just stepped into a field of infinitely bright light.    </p>
<p>The rest of <i>Milk Money</i>, or Side A, is simply fine. Dosh’s previous solo records, especially since 2006’s audacious <i>The Lost Take</i>, have been guest-heavy affairs, with songs stuffed by big beats and rock-like codas aided by unexpected influences. Perhaps saxophonist Mike Lewis lent his horn to a tune, or maybe Andrew Bird warbled a bit with his violin. They fit the eccentric, interconnected scheme of Anticon, the hip-hop miscreants who released almost all of Dosh’s material until now. But these pieces were all built without collaborators in mind, though Dosh did retroactively add vocals from a few singers, such as the slip-sliding, pitch-shifted bleat during “Unto Eternity” or the soft coos webbed throughout “We are the Worst”. Still, these shorts seem somewhat weightless and without anchor, serving more as messengers of a changing mood than as engrossing compositions. They’re the antithesis, then, of the record’s finale. These numbers remain interesting on a level of one-man-band proficiency, as when the rattling drums slingshot between the M83-like rumble and tropicália flute during the opener. But that’s something you notice from afar, not when the songs have pulled you into their orbit—something that, for the most part, doesn’t occur during <i>Milk Money</i>.</p>
<p>In an era of laptop beatmakers and producers able to conjure a full-band feeling from a few outputs and a mixer, the sounds that Dosh gets as a solo performer are not as novel as they once were, despite the workaday analog nature of how he gets them. Strangely, such a consideration has never been problematic for him before <i>Milk Money</i>, because the songs themselves moved with enough drama and dynamics to make the mechanics secondary to the material. But <i>Milk Money</i> can feel like a clinic, a demonstration of the possibilities of his prowess without any meaningful purpose for them. Of course, on Side B, Dosh reveals a clinic of exactly how this should be done, with categories and clichés cast aside in favor of a rigorous and thrilling composition. For <i>Milk Money</i>, it ultimately makes no difference whether the lede is buried (it is) or the climax comes first (there isn’t much of one); this uneven album is mostly a vehicle for “Legos (for Terry)”, an accomplishment that’s not only worth hearing but good enough to leave you hoping for more like it, too.  </p></div>"|18626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18626-dosh-milk-money/|6.6|Grayson Currin

When they race into instrumental codas at the exits of their blackened labyrinths, as they do on opener “The Tower”, they don’t do so in order to ease away from the intensity and float toward an end. They instead only get more complex, drawing outside of plain rhythmic lines. When they add an acoustic guitar, as they do on centerpiece “As Fathomed by Beggars and Victims”, they don’t do so to soften their sound or mitigate their density. They do it to make their spider-webbed arrangements that much more intricate, disrupting the generally clean spaces between their six-string bass, electric guitar, and ultra-articulate drums with a feathery texture. The song is built on deliberate, near-pneumatic pieces, but as a whole, it is a euphoric rush that delivers itself to memory.</p>
<p>Indeed, the underlying draw of <i>Obsian </i>and Castevet at large is that ability to sound incredibly visceral and obviously convoluted at once. The parts they play are intricate to the point of prog rock, but neither mannerism nor dexterity is ever the point. “The Curve”, for instance, races back and forth, up and down for eight minutes, its rhythms and riffs expanding and contracting around each other in decidedly non-linear fashion. But it hits hard, too, with a midsection that opens up like a cataract of liquid dark. Andrew Hock’s jigsaw vocals lead drums caught in a rolling boil.  </p>
<p>That’s the album’s most direct moment. On the whole, <i>Obsian</i> is a difficult record, comprising metal built on math-rock foundations so rigorous they might begin to resemble multi-variable calculus. While its six songs clock in at a combined 37 minutes, <i>Obsian </i>feels longer, thanks to the panoply of bits it contains and the force with which they’re delivered. In that way, Castevet recalls the music of Profound Lore labelmates Portal—fairly succinct but especially layered, demanding that you lean in close and devote your attention.  </p>
<p>Castevet’s debut, 2010’s <i>Mounds of Ash</i>, was by no means <i>easy</i> music, but it would stomp and surge in recognizable ways—straight-ahead black metal charges, slinking midsections and interludes, grand euphoric washes. Its successor<i> </i>is never quite so obvious or identifiable. Sure, the guitars of “Cavernous” possess the tremolo sweep and tinny sustain of black metal, but the rhythm section adds unleavened weight, pulling all the elements toward an irregular core. Ian Jacyszyn—a wonderful, exhilarating drummer who plays like an immaculate machine connected to an imaginative mind—motors between blast beats and stuttering syncopation, high-test thrash and patient doom. Hock mostly works an imported, exasperated death metal bark; he welcomes in the dark, crooning tenor of Nick Podgurski (Feast of the Epiphany/ex-Extra Life) for oblong closer, “The Seat of Severance”.</p>
<p>These two seem to have found the missing link, too: Though they remain a trio for <i>Obsian</i>, Castevet added Nicholas McMaster as their third and most interesting bassist to date. Familiar from Bloody Panda or his steadily increasing role in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"" target=""_blank"">Krallice</a>, McMaster intuits the simultaneous interests of Castevet—that is, to deliver both body and brain shots. The bright notes of his bass slide into the cracks between the guitars and drums, sometimes suggesting jazz-fusion or King Crimson. Call it shared perspicacity: McMaster has added yet another through-line of complexity to Castevet rather than simply sitting near the edges of the trio’s motion. These three components now share the marquee.</p>
<p>You might not take to <i>Obsian</i> immediately. It might sound impenetrable or, more likely, it will simply sound fine, like American black metal tempered by vintage Touch &amp; Go impulses. Keep at it. The first time I listened, I was on a bus, probably checking e-mail and watching the people around me, with the music loosely in the mid-ground. But I listened again and again, alternately zooming in on the elements (the dry, high bass parts of McMaster just before the five-minute mark of “Cavernous”) and zooming out to see their cumulative effect (the Godflesh-toned, Emperor-transcendent power of the band at the same moment). That appears to be the way <i>Obsian</i> was made, after all, with attention paid to the way details stand on their own and how they function within something much bigger than themselves, a solo or a Byzantine display of dexterity. <i>Obsian</i> does not wither in its own freakshow of technicality or brandish any hyperbolic brutishness. Rather, it finds a rarified balance between the two, then teases, dares and challenges you to engage with both levels at the same time. </p></div>"|18549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18549-castevet-obsian/|8.1|Grayson Currin

Over his short but industrious career he’s displayed an almost pathological inability to stick with any one particular style of music for more than a few minutes at a time. He’s remixed everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Waka Flocka Flame</a> to Danish pop duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28590-quadron/"" target=""_blank"">Quadron</a>, and his DJ sets bounce nimbly between disparate styles: radio rap into ambient electronics, slick 90s R&amp;B into aggressive dancehall.</p>
<p>In his own productions he’s been relatively more consistent, but still wide-ranging. His original works tend to consist of a rap beat, often one that uses the rhythms of trap rap and sounds that could've been lifted off the laptop of an experimental electronic musician, layered with washes of synthesizers and manipulated vocal samples that deliver the same benzo bliss as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28501-shlohmo/"" target=""_blank"">Shlohmo</a>, albeit with a more ragged, deconstructed feel. With subtle tweaks to his formula he can evoke <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">the-Dream</a> with equal ease.</p>
<p>On <i>Guilt Trips</i><span>, his first solo LP (after an album length collaboration with the rapper Shady Blaze) and second major release of 2013 (after May’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18152-ryan-hemsworth-still-awake-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Still Awake</i> EP</a>), he’s still stylistically daring, but shows off a newfound focus that’s uncharacteristic but successful. There’s more clarity here than on his past work—production-wise he’s removed much of the haze that some of his other releases swam in, and the songwriting shows considerably more forethought than previous compositions, which often just wandered around for a while then ended.</span></p>
<p>His new stuff still meanders, though now with more purpose, sharper hooks, and lusher instrumental textures. They’re most apparent on the several tracks here made for vocalists like avant-rapper Lofty305 and R&amp;B singer Sinead Harnett. “Still Cold” lays a plaintive vocal by Baths over an electropop arrangement that hints at both the Postal Service and some of Brian Eno’s more accessibly quirky 70s material, and is way more hummable than any of Hemsworth’s old stuff.</p>
<p>This new straightforwardness is even more apparent on “One for Me”, featuring up and coming singer Tinashe. It sounds far less like the experimental twists on radio R&amp;B he’s made his name on, and more like something you'd straight up hear on the radio, with a popping bass line, skittering hi-hats, and Tinashe’s voice stacked in Mariah-like formations. As pop’s become increasingly enraptured by blends of rap, R&amp;B, and dance music, pop producers have taken an interest in artists like Hemsworth and his sometimes collaborators like Shlohmo and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30494-supreme-cuts/"" target=""_blank"">Supreme Cuts</a> who specialize in these sorts of combinations. A few recent largish albums have shown what seem to be clear signs of their influence. Whether it’s a conscious decision or just the result of his evolution as an artist, Hemsworth’s starting to return the favor, and in the process is looking more than capable of competing in the pop field.</p>
<p>A few small things would need to change in order for that to happen, though. His mixes, while substantially less murky than on his previous recordings, are still a little too unpolished. While there’s something idiosyncratic and slightly rebellious about his tendency to keep the low end just shy of where it should be, it also keeps the songs from being fully satisfying.</p>
<p>One thing he shouldn’t have to adapt is his stylistic peripateticism. Like his DJ sets, <i>Guilt Trips</i> is all over the place genre-wise, but it never feels dilettantish. He has an astute ability to figure out what makes different styles tick, and to replicate them in his own work. The tracks here suggest that along with trap rap, Chicago house, electropop, and the dozen or so styles that get vigorously nodded at over the span of 10 songs, he’s also starting to get a grip on the rules of composing the kind of stuff the Hot 100’s made from.

He mixed records for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a> in their early days and produced for his friend Mica Levi, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Hot Chip</a>’s Joe Goddard and Mercury award winner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28148-speech-debelle/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Speech Debelle</a>. He was talented enough to catch <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Damon Albarn</a>’s ear and was one of the musicians selected to travel to the Congo for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29897-drc-music/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">DRC Music</a> project, comfortably collaborating without the pressure that comes with being center stage.</p>
<p>The spotlight shifted onto Kwes in 2012 when he released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13285-bashful/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">“B_shf_l”</a>, a hyper-endearing R&amp;B song that helped to break him as a solo artist in early 2012. But even after that, Kwes continued to focus on collaboration, working with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10286-bobby-womack/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Bobby Womack</a> and the British songstress Eliza Doolittle as well as staging a series of operas in collaboration with Peroni brewery. Meanwhile, his music itself has ended up in some surprising places, most recently turning up as a sample on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"" target=""_blank"">Pusha T</a>’s ""Who I Am"".</p>
<p>Kwes, then, seems capable of working at a faster clip for and with others than he can as a solo artist. His debut album, <i>ilp</i>, has been about four years in the making, partly due to a six or seven month period of creative block. Records that take a long time to make often result in an enormous patchwork of influences and <i>ilp</i> is no exception: the record reflects a whole host of sensibilities, from the pastoral electronica of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>, to the traditional R&amp;B of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"" target=""_blank"">Jessie Ware</a> and the delicate production sensibilities of someone like Sampha, as well as more recently absorbed ties to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and Brian Wilson. On <i>ilp,</i> Kwes is trying to solve a tough creative riddle:  How can an experimental producer with a love for so many different styles of music emphasize his earnest, understated songs while still allowing himself the freedom to explore?</p>
<p>One strategy that Kwes employs is the seemingly straightforward pop song, rebuilt from the ground up. This approach is epitomized by “B_shf_l"", which appears again here to open the album. The song remains magnificent: its real accomplishment is using the experimental electronic music Kwes favors to recreate and recontextualize the feel of classicist pop. It’s only once you focus pretty closely that you realize “B_shf_l” is like nothing you’ve ever heard before.  “Flower” and “Rollerblades” are ""B_shf_l""’s cousins, well-meaning pop songs that don’t quite have the snap of that first single.</p>
<p>Kwes combines his two very different skill sets most successfully on the album’s two longest songs, both of them anthemic, metaphysical explorations nestled in thorny, elaborate musical structures. “Cablecar” is an eight minute treatise of found sound and heartbreaking writing, a delicate, difficult song that slowly reveals itself over the course of multiple listens. And “Purplehands” takes its operative idea from the Brian Wilson influence that Kwes has been talking up recently, with an exploration of food and colors serving as an elegant way to talk about love.</p>
<p>But <i>ilp </i>falters on its shorter songs. Kwes frequently talks about the need for restraint and it’s clear that’s something that he struggles with in his own work. His songs have habit of getting mired, or lost entirely within the context of his ambient, occasionally overwrought music. A good example can be found in the transition between “Flower"", and “Hives""; The former is a startlingly delicate love song, the latter a static-driven instrumental. Both tracks are worthwhile but they require wholly different modes of listening and the transition from one to the other is off-putting.</p>
<p>The problem with <i>ilp </i>then is that it's not sure what kind of experience it wants to give you, be it pop or ambient, easy or difficult listening. Kwes the singer is too often overwhelmed by Kwes the producer—he places his voice in the background much of the time, allowing instrumental techniques to obscure, rather than illuminate, the subject of his songs. “Broke” is devastating lyrically but while the music adds to the atmosphere at the beginning of the song, the two elements soon lose track of one another. The track loses momentum as a result, and ends up feeling incomplete.</p>
<p>It can feel difficult to criticize an artist as flagrantly sincere and musically talented as Kwes—this is a guy who caps off his debut album with song dedicated to the love between his grandparents, after all. But as it turns out, those two qualities, the earnestness of the lyrics and the shifting quality of the music, combine to eventually thwart <i>ilp</i>’s success<i>. </i>Kwes’s gentle songwriting sensibilities are unable to keep up with his exploratory beat making and the result is too often a mismatch that ends up leaving the listner at a loss.</p></div>"|18674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18674-kwes-ilp/|6.3|Jonah Bromwich

For his Special Request project, the UK producer keeps his studio space loaded with vintage hardware, including an FM transmitter that allows him to broadcast over his own frequency and sample the results. This complicated process, which Woolford has referred to as <a href=""http://tankmagazine.com/issue-59/radio/paul-woolford"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""creating a false memory,""</a> plays a large role in his aim to honor his teenage years of listening to pirate radio, hearing the thrilling sounds of first-generation jungle and rave through his speakers as rave culture was forming and, as the years progressed, re-shaping itself into new forms.</p>
<p>""The attractive thing about pirate radio is that it sits outside of convention,"" Woolford told <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2012/03/08/paul-woolford-talks-new-project-special-request-pirate-radio-forthcoming-cd-and-more/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FACT</a> earlier this year while discussing his still-strong attachment to the format. ""So there are no rules."" The relative constraints applied to Special Request speak to a method of creating new rules to escape the encumberances of ones already in place; in other words, it's a highly conceptual project, and not the first of its kind. With Death of Rave, sound deconstructionist Leland Kirby dismantled rave's glory days as a tribute to the culture, degrading its sounds until there was little more than an exquisite corpse left over; meanwhile, Burial's own decayed-throwback style owes something to the enigmatic producer becoming enamored with artifacts of an era he didn't experience first-hand: ""Old jungle, rave and hardcore...they still sound future to me.""</p>
<p>The 38-year-old Woolford's recent tendency of looking towards the past has coincided with a spate of new visibility for the producer, who's been churning out high-grade techno for nearly a decade under his own name: his single for Hotflush this year, ""Untitled"", has become something of a low-level ""hit"", adding another jewel to the accomplished producer's already impressive crown. Capitalizing on the increase in attention, Special Request's proper debut LP, <i>Soul Music</i>, pushes the needle into the red again with winning results.</p>
<p>With a sense of nasty-edged playfulness that keeps the project's nostalgia from lapsing into stiff reverence, it's unquestionably one of the most exciting dance records of this year. When Four Tet's Kieran Hebden unleashed his own pirate-radio hat-tip this year in the form of ""Kool FM"", there was an expectation that the according full-length, <i>Beautiful Rewind</i>, would similarly dive headlong into clattering waters; that record turned out to be more subtle than expected, so anyone disappointed by Hebden's muted elegance on display there will most likely find the head-rush corrective they're looking for in <i>Soul Music</i>'s 12 tracks.</p>
<p>Woolford's ""no rules"" approach is evident from <i>Soul Music</i>'s opening track, ""Forbidden"", an icy slice of techno reinforcing the notion that Special Request is less about evoking the sounds of pirate radio's heyday and more about recreating its anything-goes attitude. Not to say that <i>Soul Music</i> isn't sonically slavish to its nostalgic ideals, too: junglist breaks abound, along with plenty of strangled vocal samples and sound effects that give each track its own open-transmission vibe. The straight-techno tracks that Woolford's put out under his name and other aliases have often been colorful and full, beacons of chaos even during minimal techno's light stranglehold on the genre. The songs collected on <i>Soul Music</i> are similarly and gleefully overstuffed, a series of funhouse constructions that approach mania with cool-handed seriousness.</p>
<p><i>Soul Music</i>'s most straightforwardly dusty moments are reminiscent of the recent work of Zomby, the bass music enfant terrible who's made a name off of contorting dance music's history in his own twisted, smoggy visage. Structurally, Zomby's own 'ardcore-revivalist vibes have often resembled tiny nuclear reactors constantly powering up and malfunctioning, brief bursts of energy with short half-lifes. Woolford's approach is different, as he lets most of these tunes stretch their legs past the five-minute mark with plenty of room to tweak their structures ever so slightly and pleasingly (see: the placid bed of tones that stride into the midsection of ""Lockjaw""'s gaping breakbeat maw). Accordingly, the collection's longest cut, a nearly eight-minute ""VIP"" edit of Woolford's remix of Lana Del Rey's ""Ride"", is <i>Soul Music</i>'s most revelatory head-rush, a constantly evolving torrent of breaks with a serpentine bassline not unlike the one that dotted the undercarriage of his 2011 single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79b0otflqjs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Can't Do Without""</a>.</p>
<p>A dense collection of dance cuts that make few overtures to those not previously converted by the genre, <i>Soul Music</i> is a thick listen that carries even more potency when broken up in small chunks than as a still-immersive front-to-back playthrough. Along with a vinyl release that took place at the top of this month, the CD and digital versions of <i>Soul Music</i> arrive with a bonus disc of selections from previous Special Request 12""s, as well as remixes from Woolford and others; while this additional volume has some essential gems—Woolford's remix of fellow Brit Tessela's already-massive tune ""Hackney Parrot"", NYC house wünderkind Anthony Naples' dissonant take on ""Mindwash"" that appeared on this year's <i>Hardcore</i> EP—it's perhaps more rewarding to seek out Special Request's excellent run of preceding EPs and build your own ""early works"" compilation here. As a single-disc shot, though, <i>Soul Music</i> is a truly unique and enriching experience: a collection of old sounds from one of dance music's enduring mainstays, re-assembled in a way that sounds fresher than ever.</p></div>"|18621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18621-special-request-soul-music/|8.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

It sounded so much like “Take Care” that viewers assumed they were listening to a Beach House song. After Volkswagen claimed no connection between the two and the band decided not to pursue litigation, the incident passed with no more than a few <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8865-harnessing-ineffable-desire-beach-house-and-the-creative-commercial/"">think-piece</a> ripples. Around that same time, however, Los Angeles musicians and new couple Amber Quintero and Mike Edge were road-tripping across the country, an experience that inspired another Beach House facsimile: their self-titled debut as Boardwalk.</p>
<p>With buzzing organs, languid guitars, Quintero's breathy murmur, and BPMs consistently between 80 and 100, Boardwalk's similarity to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16604-beach-house-bloom/""><i>Bloom</i></a> and/or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13872-teen-dream/"">Teen Dream</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13872-teen-dream/""></a></i> is hard to avoid. It's almost odd that Beach House doesn't appear once in Boardwalk’s list of influences, which includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a>, suggesting that any similarity must be the result of musical convergent evolution. Even if Boardwalk were as isolated during the recording process as they claim, and confined to classic rock and golden oldies stations while on the road before that, Beach House has been making music for nearly a decade. Even the band's name points to the influence. </p>
<p>All of which is not to say the record isn't fine to listen to. Edge–who built the equipment with which Boardwalk recorded <i>Boardwalk</i>–trades in rambling riffs with a subtle Laurel Canyon vibe, lending a pleasantly tossed-off quality to opener ""I'm Not Myself"" and a rumbling texture to ""Keep the Wolf"". ""It's Over"" hints at Quintero's Hope Sandoval potential as her voice smoothly shifts gears across her solid, if limited, range. But ""High Water"" (and, for that matter, ""What's Love"" and ""Oh Well"") is Boardwalk's ""Whispers &amp; Stories"": if you heard the song without knowing the artist behind it, the all-too-familiar chord progressions and tambourine shakes is at best kind of a rip-off, at worst misleading.</p>
<p><i>Boardwalk</i> falls into the uncanny valley between artists that sound just enough like what we already know and love and those that straight-up copy them. A good example of the former, which Boardwalk might want to think about, is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29704-widowspeak/"" target=""_blank"">Widowspeak</a>. They share Quintero's Mazzy Star leanings and draw from a long history of spaghetti westerns, but Molly Hamilton and Robert Earl Thomas assemble those sources into compelling songs that aren't quite like anything we've heard before. Whether Boardwalk are willing or able to expand their repertoire into something more distinctive remains to be seen; so far, it's hard to find anything on their debut that suggests capacity for growth. At this point in their nascent career, Boardwalk definitely have a good ear for melody–the problem is it doesn't sound like their own. </p></div>"|18610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18610-boardwalk-boardwalk/|4.8|Harley Brown

Compared to the Massachusetts hardcore institution's compelling, tightly packed explosives, anything else would seem “relaxed,” but carrying over Converge's focused barrage to Doomriders works against Newton on this latest release for Deathwish, <i>Grand Blood</i>. Across these 11 songs, Newton doesn't allow himself or the band to loosen up enough to let the material<i> </i>breathe, and this is the kind of stuff that really does want to let go and rock. <span style=""font-style: normal;"">Really, the collection has the potential to appeal a number of different audiences—Converge die-hards, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7759-motorhead/"" target=""_blank"">Motörhead</a> speedfreaks, Southern Lord hardcore kids—but partially on account of its stuffiness, falls short of those marks.</span></p>
<p>The first full song, “New Pyramids”, feels like an outtake from an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29885-all-pigs-must-die/"" target=""_blank"">All Pigs Must Die</a> session. In Doomriders' defense, they don't seem to take themselves quite as seriously as APMD, but the intensity still isn't there. Despite their reputation as a “rocking” band, they don't really go for a “rock song” until the third track, “Mankind”. It's not a terrible song by any means, though it would be best used as music played over the PA while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26973-red-fang/"" target=""_blank"">Red Fang</a> sets up. Doomriders have been described as “death 'n' roll” in some circles, but there isn't a whole lot of “death” in the equation. A feral touch wouldn't hurt. “Death in Heat” sees the band going into doomier realms, and if the production was a bit nastier, it'd make a great closing to a Nails album.</p>
<p>On the subject of Nails, <i>Blood</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> was produced by Newton's Converge bandmate Kurt Ballou. It's not as thick as his other productions, and if there's anything positive to say about the album, at least it's not a smattering wall of indiscernible riff-noise. The most egregious offense is “Gone to Hell”, which sounds like a ploy to go for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"" target=""_blank"">Baroness</a> loftiness without fully committing. Say what you will about Baroness, they have their niche carved out, and Doomriders can't say that because of </span><i>Blood</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s unevenness. Even the intro feels like a waste of half a minute. (If you're looking for an intro done well in hardcore, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31210-pharmakon/"" target=""_blank"">Pharmakon</a>'s work on Hoax's latest album is the place.) What's the use of going several different directions if you don't hit the goddamn dirt on the road?</span></p>
<p>In 2007, Doomriders released <i>Long Hair and Tights</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, a split with Japanese experimental metal trio Boris. Boris are a group that's waded in many different sounds, and pulled them off successfully most of the time. Ambient drone, Stooges-like primal rock, riffy J-pop, and noisy hardcore—that worked well enough to ward off detractors.Doomriders could have learned a lot from them, and </span><i>Grand Blood</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> could have been the rare record to go broad by not giving a fuck. Instead, it's the dude who has a lot of tattoos that conceal the fact that he's as boring as the rest of us, eating at chain restaurants and watching ABC comedies.</span></p></div>"|18629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18629-doomriders-grand-blood/|5.8|Andy O'Connor

It's a curious choice of imagery to accompany a comeback, perhaps suggesting a blank slate, a clearing out of what came before, a chance to start anew. But <i>Wed 21</i> isn't a reinvention, or any kind of new dawn for Molina. There are subtle differences between this and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9068-son/""><i>Son</i></a>, her benchmark 2006 album, although they're in the finespun details and not the overall framework. Considerable time has passed, but Molina is still on a slow evolutionary journey of her own devising.</p>
<p>Recapping her career to date involves working through a series of albums that combine earthy acoustic textures with tightly condensed loops. It's not dissimilar to the world inhabited by L.A.-via-Brooklyn duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5373-high-places/"">High Places</a>, where common folk tropes are given a nudge into the 21st century. Molina's work is contemplative but welcoming, often carrying a warmth that's inviting despite lyrics that are indecipherable to non-Spanish speakers. One of the remarkable facets of Molina's output is how her way with words quickly overcomes understanding, where simple enunciation is enough to open up a strain of thought about her motivations.</p>
<p><i>Wed 21</i> brings in a wider range of instruments than before, although the impact is barely noticeable. Molina's voice dominates, even when live drums surface or snatches of acoustic guitar thrum into the frame. That familiar tenor to her vocal is the anchor that draws this to her prior work, even when she’s manipulating it. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16149-sin-guia-no/"">""Sin Guia No""</a> we get vocal loops, multi-tracked harmonies, breathy intimacy, and a rousing chorus. Sometimes two or three of those things collide all at once, but Molina is a skilled editor, making sure not to leave an obstructive trail of clutter behind her.</p>
<p>Much of this album, like most of her recorded work, resembles a well-organized room decked out in tasteful furniture, with every part slotted neatly in place. Everything's so precise, so ordered. Little is left to chance, even when she draws back the curtains and lets a little autumnal breeze fill the air in the light pop of ""Lo Decidí Yo"", a song delivered with a similar wistfulness to some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14604-francoise-hardy/"">Françoise Hardy</a>'s work. Molina's best material only leans lightly on folk, instead becoming transportative, like a fantastic fable. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15855-juana-molina-eras/"">""Eras""</a> is the best example of that approach here, with all its stylistic turns resembling a mysteriously winding forest path.</p>
<p>Molina does humor, too, although it can feel peculiar to crack a smile at something when it's overlayed with words those who don't speak Spanish can't interpret. The title track here is an example of that, with its manic robo-melodies and creaking-chair rhythms. Mostly this is an album that's remarkable for how close Molina draws you in and then spits you out, alternating wildly between closeness and distance. The sense of familiarity carried over from her other records works in her favor, making <i>Wed 21</i> feel like an old friend who's back in town with a clutch of new stories to tell. Like all good storytellers, Molina's gift is in the delivery.</p></div>"|18666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18666-juana-molina-wed-21/|7.3|Nick Neyland

Once it kicks off in its patient, loping groove, the song settles into a zone that is simultaneously lush and austere, with only a few instruments conveying a big, roomy sound. The strings straighten out and flutter around the edges of “Eyes”, careening in and out of earshot. The rhythm section anchors everything to an elastic bassline and a floor tom. A tambourine rattles in the background, barely audible. Against this backdrop, White delivers lines about romantic uncertainty (“Sometimes the worst thing is a little bit of hope”) in a baritone so low it sounds like he’s passing along classified state secrets.</p>
<p>The mood is dreamy, even resigned—in other words, not dramatically different from the one established so capably on White’s 2012 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16963-big-inner/""><i>Big Inner</i></a>. <i>Outer Face </i>tweaks it slightly, though, as the Richmond-based musician moves forward by scaling back. Writing on the road and recording with his touring band at his own Spacebomb Studio, he set specific guidelines for this short follow-up: Guitars stayed propped on their stands in the corner of the studio. Horns were barred from the recording booth, and the piano fallboard remained shut. Those instruments were the hallmarks of <i>Big Inner</i>, which translated White’s passions for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=stax"">Stax</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=motown"">Motown</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=impulse%21"">Impulse!</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14299-duke-ellington/"">Duke Ellington</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a> into aggressively analog music that defied the current trend toward dark, 80s-based indie r&amp;b. That album stressed atmosphere, but never at the expense of rhythm.</p>
<p>These remain crucial concerns for White on <i>Outer Face, </i>but the EP is enlivened by the playful experimentalism, as though he’s breaking his sound down to its barest elements. How far can he pare down until the song disintegrates? Quite a bit, it turns out. Even with these self-imposed restrictions, he still gets a lot out of a handful of instruments. “Signature Move” is deceptively nimble funk, thanks to Cameron Ralston’s hyperactive bass and a choir that recalls Meredith Monk, the Raelettes, and the monolith from <i><a href=""http://youtu.be/GPKg2c_bRCs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2001</a></i>. Those backing singers nearly run off with the song, alternating between cajoling gibberish and cheering boxer boasts: “Joe Frazier, hard as a diamond, swingin’,” they sing in an extreme upper register, as White assays what might be considered a musical mission statement: “Take cover it’s a signature move/ and it’s slow by design.”</p>
<p>Like <i>Big Inner</i>, <i>Outer Face </i>rumbles along at a dogged midtempo, never hurried or impatient. That subdued pace not only keeps the groove in check but also delineates the mood of these two releases as interior reveries and romantic ponderings. Barely a year into White’s recording career, it has already become a defining aspect of his music, as distinctive as his fuzzy baritone and as eccentric as his Spacebomb business model. Slowing these songs to a crawl, especially given their barer-bones arrangements, only brings out their oddball nuances, like steely Blaxploitation rhythm section on “Hot Hot Hot” and the dub beat of “In the Valley”.</p>
<p>That song is one of the more disarming experiments on <i>Outer Face</i>, ostensibly an ode to the Old Dominion. “Shenandoah Valley, yeah you really got a hold on me,” he sing-speaks over and over in a rhythmic monotone, changing key with each repetition to suggest a descent down a hill toward home. The pace, however, grows halting, the cadence gangly and a little awkward. And yet, it’s hard to call it a misstep exactly. “In the Valley” succeeds on curiosity alone, showcasing White’s new take on old influences and celebrating Virginia as a place that affords him unbounded creative freedom. </p></div>"|18671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18671-matthew-e-white-outer-face-ep/|7.7|Stephen M.

For the uninitiated on the Vermont-based psych pop collective's daunting amount of material, the compilation is pretty much required introductory listening. Since 2008, they've released dozens of songs via albums, tapes, and singles. <i>Broom</i> whittled the stack down to nine, offering a glimpse into what you may have been missing. The songs are lo-fi but giddily elaborate. ""Martian Santa"" has UFO noises, a horn section, and an autoharp. There's a bubblegum jaunt to ""Don't Tread on the Museums of Your Youth"", which feels appropriate for an outfit that calls itself a ""Family Band."" They're songs with catchy hooks, quirky sonic inclinations, and perhaps most significantly, a gleefully strange sense of humor.</p>
<p>But <i>Happy Jawbone Family Band</i> is not another collection of home-recorded songs that could end up on <i>Taste the Broom Again: 2013-2017</i>. From the beginning of their new self-titled endeavor, it's obvious just how much they've cleaned up their sound. Their instruments' clarity is instantly apparent. There's a reason for the change: Most of their older stuff was recorded in the band's basement; this one was made in Gary’s Electric Studio and was recorded by Jarvis Taveniere of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a>. The organ, jangling guitars, harmonies, and drums on opening track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15849-everybody-knows-about-daddy/"">""Everybody Knows About Daddy""</a> are hi-fi and crisp. But while there's nothing as raucously blown out as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14813-now-everybody-rock-like-you-got-aids/"">""Now Everybody Rock Like You Got AIDS""</a>, <i>Happy Jawbone Family Band </i>is still very much in step with their well-established and thoroughly documented aesthetic. ""I'll Never Go Skin Deep Again"" is introduced by a lone autoharp. There's a horn section on ""Do You Want Me"", plus several other elegantly implemented details, like echoing guitars, beatific backing voals, and a string section. The resulting song is as lush and ornate as most of Sufjan Stevens' mid-2000s fare.</p>
<p>It's tempting to lump this record in with other famous indie rock outfits, what with its elaborate arrangements and twee-leaning inclinations. A <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16134-i-have-to-speak-with-rocky-balboa/"">previous Pitchfork review</a> referenced Elephant 6, which feels particularly applicable considering the new album's constantly shifting percussive sound and raggedly shouted vocals. Those aesthetic similarities only aid the band in delivering some of their best songs to date. ""Can't You Hear Me Ticking"" has a nice groove and the best use of ""pow pow pow"" in a chorus since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYCV2zybQoI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James Murphy did it</a>. There's a stately melodrama to the elaborate arrangements of ""Han Christian Andersen's 'The Little Mermaid'"". ""D-R-E-A-M-I-N'"" is a sunny pop song that makes singing along a realistic possibility on the first listen—both the spell-along chorus and the hollered ""ooohhh oh oh oh!"" vocals chanted throughout. It's got brevity and enthusiastically belted melodies that could reasonably cross over on the radio. Also: It's a song about losing a girlfriend to a Miami-based furry and murderer named Rita.</p>
<p>Clearly, they've got a knack for ridiculous imagery, but their lyrical decisions never feel chaotic or petulant or obnoxious. All over the record, there are phrases that could be loaded with symbolism—like their pseudo-sexual phrasings on ""Mr. Clean"" (""I wanted to get you in my bathtub""). ""Stay-at-Home Soldier"" initially evokes psychedelic imagery a la ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"": ""The city I live in lays covered in cream and ladies walk on crackers."" Soon, though, the chorus feasibly sounds like an allusion to video game culture—staying at home, training dilligently, and receiving hollow rewards. And while their phrases are consistently abstract, certain symbols keep popping up: Lions, breakfast, baths, and guns are all referenced multiple times on different songs. It's hard to tell if there's symbolic or narrative utility in those specific words, but they create threads that run throughout the album—connections that might not necessarily mean anything, but offer a strange sort of continuity in an otherwise lyrically scattered universe.</p>
<p>After poring over their lyrics for a while, it begins to feel unreasonable and maybe even a bit irresponsible to try and ""decode"" or ""understand"" a Happy Jawbone Family Band record. Just when you think you've made a substantial observation, you begin to wonder if you're the guy at the party explaining the deeper meanings and symbolism behind kids' cereals. HJFB live in this in-between space, where they could be pouring their hearts out, or maybe they're just fucking with you. Their songs could be played in a theater with full string and horn sections, or they could just play them at somebody's house party. But who cares? When the songs are this fun, context is overrated.</p></div>"|18668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18668-happy-jawbone-family-band-happy-jawbone-family-band/|7.4|Evan Minsker

<p dir=""ltr"">Don't mistake Avery's ambition with that of big-tent super-producers. With the blessing of UK legend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5864-andrew-weatherall/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Weatherall</a>—who once summed Avery's sound as ""<a href=""http://www.timeout.com/london/clubs/the-dj-stars-of-2012-in-pictures-11"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gimmick-free machine-funk of the highest order</a>""—Avery cut his teeth as a resident DJ at London's Fabric, an epic, expertly tuned soundsystem whose main floor is outfitted with bass transducers for a more immersive experience. The tracks on his debut LP <i>Drone Logic</i> feel tailored to this kind of high-end environment: crisp, thrumming tunes that proudly prance over a wide spectrum of frequencies. The album feels decadent, like one-percenter techno: rave music made for the best systems, to be played by the most talented DJs, drawing only from the purest eras of British dance exceptionalism.</p>
<p>Avery keeps his rhythmic patterns simple, drawing most of his drum sounds from pre-approved house and techno palates, and he does this to better showcase his big, groovy synth riffs. <i>Drone Logic</i> is overlong at nearly 70 minutes, but at no point does Avery want for melodic ideas. He loads the tracks full of acid-dusted basslines and stabbing synths, occasionally punctuating key moments with short vocal samples. Tracks like ""All I Need"" can feel a little cluttered, not because Avery overstuffs them but because they he never just lays in the groove; ideas and melodies are constantly being advanced. <i>Drone Logic</i> smartly reprises successes from Avery's early EPs, opening things up with an ""album version"" of the deep, hypnotic ""Water Jump"" and later delving into the springy sci-fi of ""Need Electric"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Avery's avoidance of breakbeats and his heavily melodic approach means there's a lot of Detroit in his sound, especially second-wave stalwarts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28606-anthony-shakir/"" target=""_blank"">Anthony ""Shake"" Shakir</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"" target=""_blank"">Carl Craig</a>, the first generation of producers with the luxury of building on a template already defined for them. Avery's at his best at his most tuneful and romantic. ""These Nights Never End"" compliments a roiling 303 bassline with a lapping, progressive synth melody and hissy strings, occasionally pulling back to allow the bassline room to tickle your hips. The crisp, sugary closer ""Knowing We'll Be Here"" drops a candied vocal sample among fizzing keyboards and a simple, hypnotic chord progression. Avery's lush psychedelics flirt with trance music, and <i>Drone Logic</i> often plays like a more urban version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15555-james-holden/"" target=""_blank"">James Holden</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1658-nathan-fake/"" target=""_blank"">Nathan Fake</a>'s pastoral sprawl.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's not hard to spot Avery's influences, and while his sound is by no means modern, it's a different kind of retro than that being proffered by his peers. Add to that its pristine production and <i>Drone Logic</i> feels modern, but miles away from the zeitgeist. Avery owns this space, and there's a refreshing self-assuredness to <i>Drone Logic</i>, which, combined with Avery's careful hand and his connections, can come off as predestined. You might find it too retro, or just not hip enough, but there is zero second-guessing on Avery's part: never does he glance over his shoulder with a nod to UK bass culture or a capitulate to a straight house track. Avery's singular vision might've left him a man without a country, but <i>Drone Logic</i>'s undeniable heft and silky craft ensure he'll have plenty of takers.</p></div>"|18638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18638-daniel-avery-drone-logic/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

The first song on their 2008 self-titled debut was a bleary-eyed, pop-metal pummel called “Prehistoric Dog”, a hilarious and juvenile burst about alien canines bound for earth on a mission of extinction. “They will erase the human race,” went the perfect and perfectly stupid gambit. “Time to kiss your ass goodbye.” In <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLiSBjWMfBs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the video</a> for the surprise hit, Red Fang jammed the song repeatedly in a tiny kitchen, waged war against Renaissance Faire agitators, and shot-gunned beer cans until they all vomited on camera, almost in unison. By the time of that album’s arrival, the four dudes of Red Fang were well traveled and adequately grizzled music-lifers who had gathered in Portland, Ore. This seemed like their chance to throw the rules and expectations out of the window, get stoned and/or drunk, and play rock'n'roll, just as they did in their lovably goofy music video for an inexplicably great song. Paired with a zealous touring schedule, their modest, familiar, no-collar approach found near-instant favor.</p>
<p>But <i>Whales and Leeches</i>—Red Fang’s third album and second for Relapse Records—is markedly fine and little else. Predictable and plain, it is the no-threats sort of stoner rock a teenager wouldn’t need to hide from suspecting parents, the kind of no-surprises stock you might play when you find yourself in need of something completely innocuous. These 11 songs mostly push forward at mid-tempo pounces with dual guitars, bass, and drums hanging together until someone pulls away for a frequent and fairly unremarkable solo. There is the requisite mid-album, ham-fisted, mean-mugging epic (two of them, actually, conveniently arranged in consecutive order for maximum skipping efficiency) and the last-ditch sprint toward the end. Even the subject matter feels pat and compulsory: There are vague threats and nondescript indignation, zombie tales and scatological tragedy, seafaring metaphors and extemporaneous nihilism. It’s the stuff you’d expect in a textbook about this brand of rock'n'roll, not from four guys who always seemed to have such unapologetic fun crafting their own mythologies.</p>
<p>Of course, Red Fang was never out to reinvent anything, but they did offer ample moments of sheer enjoyment or intrigue. Despite the amount of time the people who made <i>Red Fang</i> had already spent in other acts, that record radiated with the urgency and enthusiasm of a very young, energetic rock band. Their Relapse debut, 2011’s <i>Murder the Mountains</i>, lacked some of those immediate hooks, but there was a demented sense of trial-and-error written into the follow-up’s 12 tracks, epitomized by the stoned-and-happy bass mess “Throw Up” and the swiveling open-road epic “Number Thirteen”. <i>Whales and Leeches</i> mostly returns to the concision and direction of their premiere, but it lacks both the élan and the refrains that first earned Red Fang notice. And the oddball approach of their second effort has evaporated, too, replaced by riffs that seem like they were written on autopilot and drums that do just what you’d surmise.</p>
<p>“Blood Like Cream” wastes a disturbing lyrical conceit on boilerplate stoner rock. The stock bridge and solo are as obvious as the shout-along choruses they connect. “Voices of the Dead’” feels like the tentative, first-attempt fare of a band that’s been playing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a> and Kyuss covers in small-town dive bars but has finally worked up the nerve to test out an original in front of the locals. It’s competent, but there’s not an agent trying to squeeze in the door to sign these dudes, either. Doom belter Mike Scheidt of Yob lends his falsetto to “Dawn Rising”, offering an intriguing counterpoint to Red Fang’s usual workaday approach. Still, the song is mostly a low-tempo march toward nothing, its sizable chorus beset by verses that are melodramatically and hilariously ghoulish. The momentum slow-fades into a noisy twilight, as if only to indulge a cliché that Red Fang had hitherto skipped. “This Animal” summons the heavy, racing approach that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1943-high-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">High on Fire</a> perfected nearly a decade ago; Red Fang gets the sound right, but the song itself is dull and indistinct, a through-the-motions attempt at something not quite new.</p>
<p>Indeed, Red Fang certainly <i>sounds </i>good on <i>Whales and Leeches</i>, with the production of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists/"" target=""_blank"">the Decemberists</a> multi-instrumentalist Chris Funk again giving their instruments ample breadth and weight. But they do not match that surface with substance. The songs you’ll want to take away after repeated listens are scant, and the sense that the players are enjoying or testing themselves is nil. Worse still, <i>Whales and Leeches</i> doesn’t make the case for any aesthetic approach that Red Fang can call their own. Yes, you’ll hear traces of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10043-kylesa/"" target=""_blank"">Kylesa</a> and Kyuss, Torche and Sabbath, Electric Wizard and Nebula. But this is album three, and it’s still difficult to figure out who or what Red Fang aims to be. Part of the answer ostensibly used to be “good times,” but after two or three trips through <i>Whales and Leeches</i>, you might start to ask why this whole affair feels like homework—not only for the listener, but also, it seems, for the band that made it. </p></div>"|18396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18396-red-fang-whales-and-leeches/|5.0|Grayson Currin

On one level, the Chicago-borne sound is purely functional; its high-BPM tempos, disorienting bass lines, and hypnotically repetitive approach to sampling form the perfect soundtrack for the juke-derived footwork style of dancing, which favors fast feet and athletic skill. Near the top of this decade, footwork caught the collective ear of the always-hungry-for-something-new UK dance scene: Forward-thinking label Planet Mu delivered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14868-da-trak-genious-the-crack-capone/"">a smattering of footwork-associated releases</a> near the end of 2010, including the first volume of the scene-surveying <i>Bangs &amp; Works</i> compilation. Much of the footwork music created around that time was fascinating, inspiring—and, as home-listening material, maddening.</p>
<p>Footwork's relative inaccessibility suggested that it would become a niche concern in the constantly changing realm of dance music, but it stayed in the conversation, as solid releases from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30360-traxman/"">veterans of the sound</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17196-space-zone/"">boundary-pushing newcomers</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15621-rooms/"">canny genre-fusion outsiders</a> pushed things in more musical and distinctly individual directions. All these roads lead to <i>Double Cup</i>, the new album from Rashad Harden, who produces as DJ Rashad. A gorgeous, invigorating collection of tracks that places equal importance on melody alongside rhythmic texture, <i>Double Cup</i> is unquestionably the strongest footwork-related LP since the genre was introduced to a wider audience. This stuff would kill on a dancefloor, but you don't have to watch anyone's feet to appreciate what's on display here.</p>
<p><i>Double Cup</i> closes out a particularly fruitful year for Rashad, a two-decade-plus veteran of the scene who started dancing juke at 12 and began honing his DJ and production skills just a few years later in the early 90s. In March, he made his debut on Hyperdub with the <i>Rollin'</i> EP, an expressive collection that featured the astounding ""Let It Go"", a game-changer of a tune with rolling, hyperspeed drums and an evocative vocal sample; in July, he dropped another solid EP, <i>I Don't Give a Fuck</i>, the title track of which appears on <i>Double Cup</i>, too. (""Let It Go"", a superior cut and arguably Rashad's strongest track to date, is conspicuously absent here, but the record's overall high level of consistency makes its exclusion a negligible gripe.)</p>
<p>Ironically, <i>Double Cup</i> achieves a new level of musicality previously untouched by footwork by jettisoning much of the genre's rigid formality. This stuff is practically in Rashad's blood, so his ability to dismantle the sound he's lived with for much of his life and reassemble it in a fresh and exciting way is expected as much as it is impressive. For instance, he splices in other elements of beat-fixated music—jungle's frantic mania, bass music's oblong structures, the glowing synths of vintage house and techno, West Coast hip-hop's honey-slathered haze—to fit a more footwork-indebted framework. I've heard a few people compare <i>Double Cup</i>'s dizzying sampledelia to J Dilla's masterwork <i>Donuts</i>; while the former lacks the latter's cohesion and singularity of purpose, both records possess the similar thrill of hearing a master of an existent genre taking their sound to new, exciting heights.</p>
<p>Footwork often sounds as handmade as it does futuristic, and being able to see the seams of tracks both imperfect and flawless is one of the genre's more endearing qualities. On <i>Double Cup</i>, those seams are more or less nonexistent—for music that is so frequently intense and hard-hitting, many tracks here possess an impossibly smooth finish. From opening cut ""Feelin'""s twinkling sighs to the smothering sensuality of ""Let U No"", it at times sounds like Rashad has literally opened a window in footwork's oxygen-sealed atmosphere. The bass lines smack as hard as ever, but they're placed lower in the mix rather than serving as these tracks' central axis, creating a more varied sonic topography that's also easier on the ears.</p>
<p>Footwork's practitioners tend to congregate in scenes, and Rashad is no different: he's a founding member of the Teklife crew, whose logo is emblazoned on <i>Double Cup</i>'s packaging, and he's also a part of the largely elder-statesmen Ghettoteknicianz outfit. Accordingly, <i>Double Cup</i> is collaborative—""I Don't Give a Fuck"" and the harrowing weed anthem ""Reggie"" are the sole Rashad solo cuts here—with DJs and frequent collaborators Spinn (whose very good LP from earlier this year,<i> TEKLIFE Vol. 2: What You Need</i>, makes for a nice companion to this record), Manny, Earl, and Phil pitching in on additional beats and the occasional rap cadence.</p>
<p>It's also a largely Midwestern record, and its sole misstep occurs in the form of a collaboration with a non-regional artist: UK producer Addison Groove, whose 2010 single ""Footcrab"" was instrumental in introducing footwork's genetic material to bass music. His and Rashad's ""Acid Bit"" is an intriguing curiousity, with plenty of the acidic synth work that the name implies, but ultimately the tune is a disruption to the album's already-nebulous flow. Which raises the other caveat regarding <i>Double Cup</i>: listening to footwork in long stretches can be exhilarating, and exhilaration can often lead to exhaustion. The record runs 51 minutes long, and since it resembles less a properly structured album and more an expertly curated collection of tracks, it's best taken in smaller bursts for maximal effect.</p>
<p>The greater Chicago area has frequently been at the forefront of left-of-center sounds that have bubbled up, from the coruscating rock deconstructivism of Shellac and Big Black, to Gastr del Sol's amorphous genre fusion, to Frankie Knuckles' still-standing reign as ""The Godfather"" of house music. The past few years, especially, have provided a few fresh and unfamiliar sounds in regional hip-hop and dance music, and <i>Double Cup</i> is the latest testament to the wellspring of ingenuity that Chicago's recent musical culture has to offer. For Rashad, it's a defining statement 20-plus-years in the making, a brilliant document that puts him in the position any veteran would kill to occupy: instead of looking back at the past, now it's all about where he takes his sound next.</p></div>"|18627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18627-dj-rashad-double-cup/|8.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

He has a diehard golden-age revivalist fan base, but the farther away from Native Tongues revivalism his music travels, the more willfuly ugly it becomes, the better he gets—the waveform of his best beats would look like a grin full of broken teeth. <i>No Poison No Paradise,</i> his latest, features some of the ugliest- sounding, and therefore best and most fully-realized, music of his career. It's a serrated, mud-caked album, one that rattles and bangs like a box full of old machine parts.</p>
<p>Black Milk opens it with a quick feint, almost a joke: nine seconds of murmuring jazz organ suspiciously similar  ""Electric Relaxation"" breeze by before a blurt of static cuts through and""Interpret Sabotage"", a rusted tanker crunching its treads over Reagan-era synth equipment, rolls through. ""Fell in love with a certain era of music, never thought it would've came with a curse,"" he raps grimly, in tight, martial 6/8, the music nipping gamely at his heels.</p>
<p>The album is easily Black Milk's darkest. Even 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14619-album-of-the-year/"" target=""_blank""><i>Album of the Year</i></a>, which wrestled with a series of devastating losses and setbacks, was light-hearted by comparison, its colorful tumble of live instruments and loops keeping a semblance of a party going. On <i>No Poison No Paradise</i>, despair rots all the way into the hull. The terrifically dark ""Codes and Cab Fare"" turns a Hammond organ and a sliding bass pitch into a  sustained moan, a slow plummet in free space. ""Dismal""'s woodblock knock recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">OutKast</a>'s ""Elevators,"" but the atmosphere is minor key and uneasy,  gas fumes rising off an evaporated Neptunes production. The knock on ""Black Sabbath"" is hard enough to send furniture tipping over, and suggests Milk could have been a meaningful contributor in the room where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a> was hashed out.</p>
<p>There are a few wistful moments on <i>No Poison</i> that recall Milk's spiritual father figure <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">Dilla</a>. He reminisces about squirming uncomfortably in church pews on ""Sunday's Best"", a song that fades cleverly into ""Monday's Worst"", both songs breezing by on late-summer-light soul loops. Dreamlike sequencing touches like this are the only obvious marks of the concept behind <i>No Poison</i>, which, Black Milk tells us, functions as series of dreams inside the head of a character named Sonny, Jr.</p>
<p>There's a reason reason this conceptual framework feels vague and mushy, and it's Black Milk's career-long elephant in the room: He's a technically strong rapper, someone who writes vividly and honestly, who continually shuffles complex rhyme patterns, who audibly pops veins with his desire to<i> say something.</i> But his vocal tone is grit, sawdust, completely lacking in character. He suffers from a severe case of what Andrew Noz years ago dubbed ""Black Thought Syndrome,"" wherein a rapper with a surplus of substance suffers from a severe lack of style. For a guy with such a golden ear, you'd think he would have figured out a way to weave his vocals more musically, or more distinctively, into the richly tactile music he produces in the studio.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he seethes impressively here, performing with the determination of someone who has weathered a career's worth of these sorts of dispiriting notices. A few of his lines burst through via a sheer force of iron will, like on""Black Sabbath"": ""You know them slums where them slugs hum past your wig.""  His near-military focus and conviction carries the day. And he stretches out here and there—he hasn't always been the guy you think of when you think of ""baby-making music,"" but he sounds <i>relaxed</i> on the convincingly slinky and unzipped ""Parallels,"" like someone who is not only about to have sex, but conceivably enjoy it. On ""Sonny, Jr.,"" he brings in Robert Glasper, a vital jazz pianist and producer who has been working double-time to complicate that resume with hip-hop and R&amp;B collaborations, for an extended workout that could itself be diced up for five or six different loops. The album is full of ear-snagging textures like this, and its most compelling moments are career highlights.  </p></div>"|18615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18615-black-milk-no-poison-no-paradise/|7.3|Jayson Greene

A not-entirely-fair critique of Real Estate is that a lot of their songs sound the same—the band would beg to differ—but there’s no doubting a similarity of instrumental elements. On his own time, Mondanile’s solo recording project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27801-ducktails/"" target=""_blank"">Ducktails</a> has offered a peek into what Real Estate might sound like if they began coloring outside the lines, mixing genres while staying true to his pastoral roots. (Similar to how guitar predecessor Roger McGuinn guided the Byrds through several identities while still sounding like the same band.)  His newest EP, <i>Wish Hotel</i>, picks up where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17538-the-flower-lane/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Flower Lane</i></a> left off, playing with electronic textures to further evoke a reflexively hazy attitude toward the way of the world. <br/> <br/><i>The Flower Lane</i> was made with the help of fellow New Jerseyians <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28375-big-troubles/"" target=""_blank"">Big Troubles</a>, but on <i>Wish Hotel</i> Mondanile’s returned to recording by himself. Even so, little remains of the patchy, wandering quality that colored earlier Ducktails material. He’s become better at harnessing disparate elements toward a congealed whole: the swirling synthesizer reinforcing the resonant strum at the beginning of “Honey Tiger Eyes"", the sustained tones that lend “Tie-Dye” an eerie, otherworldly quality when combined with Mondanile’s breathy vocal. Where <i>The Flower Lane</i> went all over the place, <i>Wish Hotel</i>’s brevity makes it a set of variations on a theme. This is mood music, best exemplified by bucolic instrumental “Naive Music” that sounds like a really great jam session... with himself. Mondanile isn’t making any grand departures from Real Estate’s core theses, but he’s using a wider range of tools to look inward and keep the vibe going. Your tolerance for that vibe may vary; reviewing <i>The Flower Lane</i>, Steven Hyden wrote that “after a while Mondanile’s attachment to the pleasantly ephemeral starts to feel like a dodge.” <br/><br/>There are indeed diminishing returns to being so laid back, and Mondanile can sometimes sound like he’s mumbling with a mouthful of Oxycontin. But the slightly stupefied delivery also comes off confessional, helping with the personal truth at the heart of some of his songs. On <i>Wish Hotel</i>, Mondanile cloaks his vocals in a way that suggests layers of interior mystery, like he’s reading from a water-logged, page-torn diary. “Hidden under leaves no one will see/ So you might as well stay there,” he whispers on “Tie-Dye”; “It’s the story of my life/ No one believes me/ But I wish you would,” he admits on “Wish Hotel"". If, in spite of his lyrical introspection, Mondanile doesn’t seem to be communicating any greater depth—well, that’s part of the bummer of being a chill guy. It's hard to be taken seriously when it seems like nothing bothers you at all. <br/><br/>Not everything about this record is hidden meanings and coy smiles, though: There’s also a song called “Jazz” that plays out in a 5/4 shuffle, making the title so overtly descriptive I can’t decide if it’s supremely corny or simply one of the most unimaginatively earnest song descriptions since Macklemore’s “White Privilege"". Still, the track transcends its cutesy moniker as Mondanile flitters up and along the wending melody, sighing with romantic lilt about an ambiguous relationship. <i>Wish Hotel</i> might be ephemeral but it's ultimately pleasing, a cloud of scented smoke floating from your speakers to score an overcast day. He might never touch his feet to the ground or reveal a greater breadth of songwriting personality, but why should he have to?</p></div>"|18635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18635-ducktails-wish-hotel-ep/|7.0|Jeremy Gordon

Sometimes it displaces you, allows escape to a nightclub, or a house party, or some imagined communal experience. It can also have essentially the opposite effect, when its repetition and minutiae center your thoughts, allowing you focus on the task at hand. The most striking aspect of <i>Livity Sound</i>, a compilation-cum-artist album from the Bristol label and crew of the same name, is that it does neither of these things. Rhythmic, syncopated drum-machine music at its core, <i>Livity Sound</i> is too abstract to transport you, and too bewitching to sink into the background. The collective, which takes its name from a Rastafarian word meaning, roughly, life-force, conjures bantamweight dance music that builds on Bristol's long tradition of pioneering dub while establishing itself as one of the finest examples of bass music's assimilation of house and techno.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Livity Sound, the label, is the brainchild of Tom Ford, a Bristol fixture who aided the city's adoption of dubstep via his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14865-worth-the-weight-bristol-dubstep-classics/"" target=""_blank"">Punch Drunk</a> label, which released key records by locals like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8810-appleblim/"" target=""_blank"">Appleblim</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5922-pinch/"" target=""_blank"">Pinch</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22494-joker/"" target=""_blank"">Joker</a> (and continues to do so). Ford, who records under the names <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22787-peverelist/"" target=""_blank"">Peverelist</a> and, more recently, just Pev, grew weary of dubstep's direction at the end of last decade. He re-focused his efforts with the help of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31347-kowton/"" target=""_blank"">Kowton</a> (Joe Cowton, who has produced with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29346-julio-bashmore/"" target=""_blank"">Julio Bashmore</a>) and Asusu (Craig Stennett); the three combine in various iterations to form the output of Livity Sound. Much of what constitutes <i>Livity Sound</i>'s two discs has been released before, albeit only on vinyl and only in Europe. Strung together, the tracks are of a piece, an album that stares a swarm of knuckle-cracking drum machines in the face and emerges with a lucid, psychedelic calm.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The closest analogue to Livity's aesthetic might be the finely tuned hallucinations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8811-shackleton/"" target=""_blank"">Shackleton</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12811-soundboys-gravestone-gets-desecrated-by-vandals/"" target=""_blank"">Skull Disco</a> label (on which Peverelist appeared), albeit minus that label's swampy humidity and noir-ish posturing. Livity's focus is squarely on rhythm programming: choppy, hovering patterns that carry with them their own peculiar logic. Lots of toms, congas, and some distinct tunings ensure the tracks, like those of Skull Disco, have a non-Western air to them (a feeling aided by the glyphs that adorn Livity's recordings). Otherness, however, isn't the point; it's a byproduct of three producers working on the edges of functional club music. Indeed, many of these tracks—Pev's mesmerizing ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAixPFgn_YU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aztec Chant</a>"" in particular—have for months been populating the mixes of Europe's progressive DJs. Like any good subversive, a Livity track knows when to blend in.</p>
<p><i>Livity Sound</i> feels fossilized in its rigidity and dustiness. Its tracks are the calcified vestiges of Bristol's healthy dub history, from the aqueous sub-bass of jungle to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Massive Attack</a>'s laconic pop. The song titles are fitting: ""Remnants"", ""Raw Code"", ""Erosions"". Melodic elements are spare, as if they've been rationed, but potent: ""More Games"" features an ominous staccato synth riff borrowed from a dozen grime white labels, while ""Livity"" contorts a house piano line into a carnivalesque oddity. More often, the rhythms—and their off-balance syncopations, their relentless clapping—compose the motifs. At times, as on the steamy ""Raw Code"" or the haunted ""Too Much Time Has Passed"", it feels like the producers have removed dub's all-encompassing echoes and laid its bones in the street.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's plenty of echo on <i>Livity Sound</i>, even if it feels shallow and a little barren. It's part of what makes these tracks so disarming and hypnotic. <i>Livity Sound</i> is relentless without being aggressive or overbearing; it's just always there, tapping away. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/"" target=""_blank"">Basic Channel</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14226-digital-mystikz/"" target=""_blank"">Digital Mystikz</a> before them, it would be easy enough to ascribe genre names to Livity Sound, but it's more fulfilling to think of them as delinquent nephews of dub reggae. The tracks, and the arid stare their grooves perpetuate, are like crop circles drawn into the UK hardcore continuum: functionally new, eerily primeval.</p></div>"|18622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18622-livity-sound-livity-sound/|8.1|Andrew Gaerig

No sooner than the drums unload their initial heavy hit on the band’s first album in six years—the ridiculous ripper <i>From the Ages</i>—Isaiah Mitchell takes his first solo, his squealing lead slashing cleanly through a vacant gaze of cymbal wash. The band soon digs back in, with drummer Mario Rubalcaba and bassist Mike Eginton instantly stitching a sturdy pocket. But it’s Mitchell that almost always edges out front in Earthless. He rides through a riff and races off into tangents for minutes on end. After that lead burst during album opener “Violence of the Red Sea,” he bends a theme a half-dozen different ways, whether retracing his lead with a wah-wah moan here or a whammy bar battle with himself there. Rubalcaba and Eginton don’t pull Mitchell back toward earth; they instead follow his ecstatic lead everywhere, fellow travelers on his odyssey of enthusiasms.</p>
<p>Since Earthless’ last album, 2007’s <i>Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky</i>, its members have been busy: Rubacalba has been behind the throne for <a href=""http://www.sandiegoreader.com/bands/mario-rubalcaba/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">new old punks OFF!</a> and out front for <a href=""http://spiderfever.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">San Diego pounders Spider Fever.</a> Mitchell joined Howlin Rain for its Rick Rubin-helmed catastrophe <i>The Russian Wilds</i> and started the blustery, concise psych group <a href=""http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Golden-Void/Golden-Void#.Ul79wRY5TGM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Golden Void</a> with some high school buddies and his wife. Mitchell actually presaged Golden Void at the end of <i>Rhythms </i>with the swiveling <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyLrD-OAu2k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Groundhogs</a> cover “Cherry Red”, the shortest bit of Earthless’ oeuvre by a quarter-hour.</p>
<p>The experience of getting back into bands playing discrete tunes serves <i>From the Ages </i>well, as Earthless breaks the album’s hour-plus runtime into four digestible tracks. “Violence of the Red Sea” syncs well with “Uluru Rock”, a smoldering tune that’s steadily fanned until it leaps into flames. By trek’s end, the rhythm section’s beating back hard against Mitchell, his fingers bouncing between notes as though his hands are the levers <i>and</i> posts of a pinball machine. “Equus October” indulges a cosmic drift, with the bass leading the Om-like way for circular drums and a twilit haze of electrostatic ambiance. It’s an uncharacteristically subdued side of Earthless. As such, it only last five minutes.</p>
<p>The closing title track, however, burns on for more than half an hour. It’s the sum of everything before it, not only in length but also in the establishment of a structure and dynamic that allow the span to be an epic, not just another tedious bro jam. The trio roars at the start, drums and bass thrashing behind Mitchell’s lead. They shift into a viscous blues bounce and then into a great astral smear, eventually riding an Arabian riff into a meditative rumble. The guitar lines waft like smoke across an empty field. Earthless sit still a bit too long here; remarkably, this is the one moment of <i>From the Ages</i> where the band’s patience might test your own. But they come roaring back, driving into a coda that’s heavier than anything they’ve ever done. All the solos and sidetracks collapse into one brilliant exit. A journey meant for getting lost suddenly makes good on the destination.</p>
<p>In 2013, the place and purpose of acts like Earthless or Endless Boogie elicit some interesting questions about genre and intent. These are essentially roadhouse bands, capable of stretching a rock'n'roll theme from here to infinity. But when so many of us can’t pay attention enough to engage with an entire album, is there a need for an hour of three dudes tracing and retracing a melody? Does this digressive stuff work only on stage, where a few beers and a few puffs have softened everyone’s focus enough to sink into solo after solo after solo? Is this the jurisdiction of jam bands, in the most cynical and checked-out sense? To an extent, yes: Earthless’ music—not unlike that of Sleep or Bardo Pond or Eternal Tapestry or, you know, The Grateful Dead—requires a certain suspension of <i>now</i>, a commitment to and comfort with being ferried away for however long they please. But <i>From the Ages</i> is more a reminder of the fun that can be had with the most basic elements of rock, too. This is the atavistic magic of three people locked in a room only with their instruments and each other, eyes closed, and mouths open. Earthless are incredibly indulgent, sometimes to a fault, but they’re much too excitable to be called selfish or masturbatory. The dudes are once again just riffing here. It’s a trip worth taking, at least a few times. </p></div>"|18558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18558-earthless-from-the-ages/|7.2|Grayson Currin

On her band’s new mini-album, <i>Fade Away</i>, she’s often found monitoring the unsettling passage of time. “I don’t know who I am this year,” goes one song. “When did I wake up and suddenly my soul had grown so old?” she asks. “Last 30 seconds I’ll wait for him,” she sings, resigned and bitter. “You taught me that my heart would grow old.” And as if giving herself a pep talk to buffer the unease: “Life is short but so am I. What does it matter, anyway?” Over the span of three years and two full-lengths, Cosentino has achieved a rarefied sort of indie-rock success and its attendant stardom, but she’s still left asking the questions you ask once you realize adulthood is not the bed of enlightenment it’s advertised to be. What do I have to show for myself? Am I any smarter than I used to be? Why isn’t this getting easier? And literally: Who have I become?</p>
<p><i>Fade Away</i> attempts to answer these questions in a single, satisfying way: by returning to the unmistakable elements that characterized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Best Coast</a> when they hatched during the fuzzy garage-pop boom a few years ago. She's back with propulsive melodies, a significant dose of reverb, repetition, and sticky, simple lyrics about aimlessness and the type of love that advances at a lackadaisical West Coast pace. The project is a return to form in the most literal of senses, too—it’s out on Cosentino’s new label, Jewel City, and at an unorthodox seven-song length, it has the scrappy, self-governed feel of her band’s early demos, albeit with a bit more polish. There are no name producers in the credits or songs that sound like jingles written for the Los Angeles Department of Tourism. Which is to say there’s nothing on <i>Fade Away</i> that would fit naturally on Best Coast’s slickly inert sophomore album, <i>The Only Place, </i>a record that boasted maturity but never really resonated.</p>
<p>But while it’s tempting to claim that Best Coast have reverted to a simple formula, or to think of <i>Fade Away</i> as an easy stopgap between <i>The Only Place</i> and the band’s next record, that’s not quite what’s happening, either. There are touches of sophistication across <i>Fade Away</i> that Best Coast haven’t been able to achieve until now, and Cosentino glides easily between shades of guitar-pop and chillier sounds. She seems as comfortable on a swooning ballad (“Fade Away”) as she does on a song that harnesses the frenetic sugar of Josie and the Pussycats (“This Lonely Morning”) or the gauzy whisper of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24033-mazzy-star/"" target=""_blank"">Mazzy Star</a> (“Baby I’m Crying”). She’s flexing her muscles as a songwriter, and she makes something that’s probably very difficult sound as though it comes easily to her.</p>
<p>The Cosentino who openly admits to struggle, or to not having figured it all out, then, is now relegated a familiar lyrical space. It can be easy to write her words off as too simplistic, too repetitive, or to dismiss them as retrograde in sentiment, but those qualities are what allow Best Coast to endure in a sea of acts with similar aesthetics. Cosentino is unafraid to fuss over the trivialities of plain old-fashioned love in a time when marriage has been described as the merging of brands. She’s ambivalent or confused about pretty much everything while everyone else’s tastes are codified to Likes. She has become reliably great at distilling a complex range of human emotion to basic sentences, and all of a sudden, the weed leaves and cats and cut-outs of the shape of California are merely kitschy insignias rather than overarching frameworks. ""I won't change/ I'll stay the same,"" she sings on ""I Wanna Know"". While Cosentino is anxious to figure out who she’s become, <i>Fade Away</i> points to how strong she’s been all along.</p></div>"|18623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18623-best-coast-fade-away/|7.4|Carrie Battan

But Motörhead are, above all, a working outfit. The earthy counterpart to grandiose NWOBHM contemporaries Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, they've positioned themselves as the UK answer to ZZ Top—paring down their palette to the bare essentials, cruising the globe decade after decade, and churning out new material in their unmistakable biker-punk thrash'n'roll idiom.</p>
<p>The three-year interim between <i>Aftershock</i>—the new 21st Motörhead LP—and its 2010 predecessor, <i>The World Is Yours</i>, was an unusually long one for the band, who have averaged a studio album every other year for the duration of their nearly four-decade career. It's tempting to read into the data, given Lemmy's <a href=""http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mot-rhead-s-wacken-open-air-performance-cut-short-due-to-lemmy-s-health/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">health scare</a> at the Wacken Open Air fest this past August. But if the 67-year-old frontman is slowing down, he's not letting it on here.</p>
<p>Yes, in many ways, <i>Aftershock</i> is just another Motörhead record. The album's ain't-broke, wouldn't-dream-of-fixing-it style won't surprise anyone familiar with the band's current incarnation—the trio of Lemmy, guitarist Phil Campbell, and drummer Mikkey Dee, going strong since 1995. But the measure of a Motörhead LP isn't the wealth of fresh information it provides; it's how well the release encapsulates the band's quintessential sound. The great thing about Motorhead's stubborn unchanging-ness is that each new dispatch has the potential to be their best to date.</p>
<p>So is <i>Aftershock</i> the ultimate Motörhead album? Probably not. <i>Ace of Spades</i> is legendary for a reason, and lesser-known efforts from 1986's quirky yet vicious <i>Orgasmatron</i> to 2004's mighty <i>Inferno</i> deserve places near the top of the canon. But taken on its own terms, the LP is deeply satisfying and frequently thrilling. A listener with no prior knowledge of the band—an alien visitor, let's say, or an amnesiac—could hear this and grasp why Motörhead is rightly considered one of hard rock's true titans.</p>
<p><i>Aftershock</i> is packed with uptempo ragers, the kind of track that Lemmy seems to stockpile in unlimited supply and that, if you've got a taste for this sort of thing, never gets old. Cranking up album-opening flattener ""Heartbreaker"" or headlong deep cut ""Going to Mexico"" feels like strapping yourself to the underside of a Harley, rumbling in time with the engine, and breathing pure exhaust. (Longtime collaborator Cameron Webb's production job, gritty and full of oomph, is a serious plus in this regard.) As rollicking as these tracks are, they're far from reckless. Lemmy's affinity for the unpretentious craftsmanship of everyone from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrBatz0vaGI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chuck Berry</a> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHc6x01QCKk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Ramones</a> isn't always obvious, but <i>Aftershock</i>'s brief song lengths and wealth of unshakeable choruses remind you that he's just as fixated on catchiness and concision as on speed and power.</p>
<p>And though you'll often find Lemmy, Campbell, and Dee operating here as a single streamlined entity, skillful arrangements ensure that the listener appreciates the component parts of this classic power trio. Check out how the players enter one-by-one at the beginning of ""Death Machine"", spotlighting the mesmerizing bluster of Lemmy's distorted bass. Meanwhile, the main attraction, the frontman's inimitable gravelly gargle, sounds as visceral as ever. On tracks like the speed-freak anthem ""End of Time"", his delivery seems like a physical paradox, raising the question of how such a brutally weathered instrument can retain such a high degree of melodic precision.</p>
<p>Contrary to their monolithic image, Motörhead has always seasoned their records with a few palate-cleansers, and the ones on <i>Aftershock</i> are especially strong. ""Lost Woman Blues"" is exactly what it sounds like—a moderate-pace 12-bar brooder sung in elegantly understated fashion by a man who's earned his moaning privileges many times over. ""Dust and Glass"", the most atypical track on the record, is also one of the best. Backed by a chilled-out roots-rock tune with shades of Zeppelin, Lemmy muses on life's ephemeral nature in an endearingly fragile sing-song.</p>
<p><i>Aftershock</i> does have its pedestrian moments. Even allowing for the Sunset Strip lasciviousness that's an integral part of the late-period Motörhead aesthetic, ""Crying Shame""—with its piano-accented refrain and ""C'mon, mama, get down on your knees"" exhortation—still comes uncomfortably close to Great White–style cheese. But the majority of the record is a classic ride-or-die Motörhead proposition, punctuated with just the right amount of breathing room. In theory, what the band does might seem overfamiliar, but in practice, it's a minor miracle that they're still doing it so well.</p></div>"|18643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18643-motorhead-aftershock/|7.6|Hank Shteamer

A few years ago, Mississippi-based musician Cole Furlow kicked his can down shitgaze hall by releasing a steady trickle of feedback-swathed pop nuggets as <a href=""http://deadgaze.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dead Gaze</a>, which eventually led to a self-titled compilation of several 7’’ singles and cassettes released earlier this year. When a friend offered 11 days of free time at famed Mississippi studio Sweet Tea, he seized the chance to clean up his act. On <i>Brain Holiday</i>, he’s swept away the detritus and placed his personality front and center, revealing a sharp ear for psychedelia-indebted garage rock that doesn't rely on obfuscation to get across.   </p>
<p class=""p1"">The new approach is clear from album opener “Yuppies Are Flowers"", which jauntily layers several instruments before ceding the stage to Furlow’s supple voice. Here, that voice grounds what might have been a run-of-the-mill metaphor—people as flowers growing on a tree!—with melodic intuition, giving honesty to a lyric about taking your time to get your act together. “The kids are alright” isn’t a new thesis, but Furlow avoids sounding defensive or snotty about his perceived complacency. If he’s arguing with an imaginary parent about his life plan, his response isn’t a slammed door but a believable reassurance that everything will be alright. (“When you grow up, you’ll see/ All the things that you wanted to see from me”) It’s brave but not boisterous, helping him avoid coming off like just another millennial brat you read about in magazine think pieces. His vocal flexibility, which allows him to sometimes sound as congenial as a band like Rooney—a decade ago, parts of this record would’ve been catnip for <i>The O.C.</i>’s music supervisor—or as unrestrained as Howlin’ Wolf, gives <i>Brain Holiday</i> its nuance. The twinkling arrangement on “Stay, Don’t Stay” might’ve scanned as a little fey were Furlow not there to sound knowingly fragile; meanwhile, “Rowdy Jungle” maximizes its utility as a slacker anthem (“Please believe me when I say there is absolutely nothing that could get in our way"") through a drawl sounds completely sure of itself but totally uninterested in convincing you. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Though <i>Brain Holiday</i>’s lyric sheet<i> </i>would stand alone as a thesis of things Cole Furlow Believes, his ear for collage and crunchy guitar hooks help elevate his words beyond mere didacticism. Most of the album is largely built from familiar garage rock chords—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8611-weezer-green-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>Green Album</i></a> feels like an easy reference point, as do <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Segall</a>’s fuzzier records—but that free studio time enabled Furlow to incorporate more disparate elements, such as the mean horn that cuts through the late period Beatles-esque “Runnin on the Moon” and the plaintive piano progression driving “Breathing Creatures”. A more amateur recording definitely wouldn’t have sounded as varied or unmuddled by textural confusion.</p>
<p class=""p3"">When he does default to old habits and amp up the reverb, the creative intent seems more certain. “You’ll Carry on Real Nice”, originally included on the self-titled album and re-recorded here, sounds properly frayed and blown out as Furlow’s voice is stretched to its breaking point. Similarly, “A Different Way” wraps a bold lyric—”I believe there is a different way/ And there’s nothing we can’t do”—in a rumbling, sinuous column of noise like a monument to his willpower. Not all of his decisions are outright home runs, but there’s rarely an unpleasant moment; it's a confident, catchy record that makes you wonder if all lo-fi acts would sound this good if given that studio time, or if Furlow's a real voice of his generation. My bet's on the latter. In the album’s promotional material, Furlow stated his wish to make an album for people to listen “when they need something to get their brain off whatever it is that's making them go to the music in the first place."" <i>Brain Holiday</i> sounds like that kind of safe space, but it’s also a testament to what can be accomplished when you’re a little distracted.</p></div>"|18624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18624-dead-gaze-brain-holiday/|7.1|Jeremy Gordon

Since introducing himself with his debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13648-continent/"" target=""_blank""><i>Continent</i></a>, Silver has released a series of EPs that, given their length and depth, work as larger statements rather than placeholders. Reliably innovative and stimulating, these efforts helped illuminate the varied intellectual curiosities (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16565-cfcf-exercises-ep/"" target=""_blank"">architecture</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14941-the-river-ep/"" target=""_blank"">film</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18281-cfcf-music-for-objects-ep/"" target=""_blank"">objects</a>) that inform his constantly mutating palette, often with arrestingly beautiful results. In the ever-expanding sphere of electronic musicians willing to take risks, Silver managed to stand out thanks to both his willingness to think outside the box and his keen pop sensibilities. So it's no surprise that, on <i>Continent</i>, he's embracing the traditional aspects of the long-player format on <i>Outside</i>, crafting vaporous, understated tracks that often play as updates on vaguely new age-y, soft rock radio staples.<br/><br/>One of Silver's greatest strengths is his ability to modify his sound while still sounding uniquely like himself. <i>Outside</i> boasts the same familiar textures and colors we've come to expect from CFCF, evidenced by the fluorescent kabuki dreamscapes (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15815-jump-out-of-the-train/"" target=""_blank"">""Jump Out of the Train""</a>) and sweltering, celestial atmospherics (""Find"") on display here. But instead of simply losing himself in the haze of its translucent pastels, Silver uses <i>Outside</i> as a bid to ground his music with more approachable song structures. Touching on the likes of Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel and even Sting, Silver gives the album a more human touch, inspired by ""the yearning for stability that comes from constant movement."" Amorous and aching, it's no wonder Silver feels the urge to throw himself from the train, as much of the album evokes how the strange, reflective quietude of a life spent inside the cabin can dull the realities of the busy, bleary landscapes rushing past your window.<br/><br/>The most notably different thing about <i>Outside</i> is the return of Silver's actual voice, now more in the foreground than on any of his previous releases. It's unspectacular—hushed, a little flat, at times almost plainspoken—but one with a deliberate purpose, used to bring more shape and emotional clarity to these pieces. He even goes so far as including a surprisingly faithful cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsQ8TqXr7B0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Strange Form of Life""</a>. But most of the time, Silver's vocal presence acts as more of a distraction than a guiding light. While a good portion of these songs would sound unfinished without a lyrical component, you can't help but wonder what <i>Outside</i> would sound like with anchored by a different person (or persons) on vox, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28560-active-child/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Active Child</a> assist on ""Train"" notwithstanding. <br/><br/>Much like <i>Continent</i> or any of the subsequent EPs released under the CFCF name, <i>Outside</i> is designed to wash over you, creating an immersive experience that often times helpfully obscures the weightiness of Silver's concept exercises or, in this case, hokey confessional pop. Except this time around, the effect can't quite stand up to his current fascination with slightly warmed-over, 80s adult contemporary looks. Needless to say, if you balked at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ssHe4i8yhk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beth/Rest""</a>, it's unlikely that you'll take much interest in the minimalist takes on Tears For Fears (""Feeling. Holding""), softcore cable porn soundtracks (""The Crossing""), or the funereal ""Miami Vice"" vibes (""This Breath"") that pepper the record. It's not that Silver doesn't successfully develop these ideas, but he presents them in ways that are too resolute and self serious to be effectively absorbed.<br/><br/>And yet, with repeated listens, Silver's hypnotic grip strengthens, often overshadowing his cheesier impulses. ""The Forest At Night"" is as revealing a title as any, while the excellent ""Find"", with its hair metal ballad guitar and humid, swelling synths, feels very much in spirit with the music of former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Mark McGuire</a>. On opener ""Beyond Light"", Silver finds himself back in the depths of some Herzog-ian jungle scene, all maddening arpeggios and tribal drums. The beauty of a project like CFCF is that it's an amorphorous one, despite the clear lines that can be drawn from one release to the next. The shadows its shape casts may not always create flattering silhouettes, but there's both comfort and anticipation to be found in knowing that Silver's constantly tweaking the lighting.</p></div>"|18663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18663-cfcf-outside/|6.7|Zach Kelly

Never mind the weighty guitars that hang like thick shadows or the forceful drums that punch through them. Forget the enraged voices that bellow the lyrics and the slide guitar line that closes tight like a noose, too. Instead, listen to <i>what</i> Rebecca Vernon has to sing: She sets a scene of accepted and quiet suffering, where lakes go septic and unhappiness gets swept under the rug. Dreams are dreamt only in the privacy of homes and otherwise suppressed. The rich lords expect to be left alone, to be given time to “anoint themselves in their finest.” Vernon ends with a glimpse of possible redemption, a Plato’s Cave moment where the narrator intuits life outside of the town’s shadowy desolation. This is the lament of a layperson holding onto the distant promise of hope, a tune not unlike one that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_of_American_Folk_Music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harry Smith might’ve collected</a>.</p>
<p>This isn’t surprising for SubRosa. On 2011’s <i>No Help for the Mighty Ones</i>, the band covered the morose, damned-to-hell Scottish ballad <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op9j7X5BPGw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The House Carpenter”</a>, a song <a href=""http://thatshowkidsdie.com/2011/03/24/interview-subrosa/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vernon admits</a> she first heard through Smith’s <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>. But that was just an eerie a cappella interpretation. “Fat of the Ram”, like the rest of <i>More Constant than the Gods</i>, is an exceptionally articulated full-band assault, arranged to give each song and story beneath it maximum impact. Often in doom, the impulse can be to turn up and drown out, treating the song mostly as a reason for amplifier massages. (To wit, see the recent Windhand LP, <i>Soma</i>.) This quintet—two violins, three vocalists, bass, drums and Vernon’s wonderful guitar—are much more meticulous than that, treating each number like its own opera rather than an excuse for an onslaught. Combined with Vernon’s uncommonly keen ear for hooks (however dark-hearted they may be) and the band’s grand sense of dynamics, that approach keeps <i>More Constant than the Gods</i> moving throughout its 68 minutes. It’s too active and involving to become a slog or a bore. Instead, it’s one of the year’s most exhilarating heavy metal records.</p>
<p>The members of SubRosa seem to understand these songs and what Vernon is trying to communicate with them, as if she workshopped the lyrics in front of them. The playing is never too deep or too wide, always moving in service of her meaning. The irritation and insurrection written into “Fat of the Ram”, for instance, shows up in the music, with its start-and-stop lashes of sound directed at the blindly content townsfolk and their scheming leaders. “Everywhere I look/ all I see is famine,” Vernon sings at one point, her voice suddenly downshifting into droll scorn. The music slows into a formless blur behind her, underlining the desperation in her observation. It’s Leadbelly kicked forward several decades. Likewise, “The Usher” opens with a duet above a twinkling bed of noise, Vernon trading lines with the gentle-voiced Jason McFarland as a violin etches curlicues against the din. The band finally lunges forward in unison, affixing their heaviness to a surprisingly forward tempo. This is a love song to the dark and to mortality, so SubRosa afford it a sinister romanticism. Bright violin leads peeking out through the down-tuned glumness, and the feeling is terrifying but warm.</p>
<p>The spirit doesn’t dovetail with the song only in these epics. Each of <i>Constant</i>’s six tracks either ignores or approaches the 10-minute mark, except for the seven-minute “Cosey Mo”, practically making it a radio single. SubRosa lend the tale of immortal grievances and obsessions appropriate drama. The strings are essential here. In the chorus, the violins of Sarah Pendleton and Kim Pack surge behind the guitars and vocals, helping to brand the refrain into memory. During a slinking little midsection, they trace pizzicato patterns around the gathering storm of Vernon’s voice. Finally, as the coda crests, they mirror and then fight against Vernon’s riff, reflecting the unresolved tension of the song’s quest to avenge or at least vindicate a death. Though “Cosey Mo” is the record’s shortest and most immediate song, it’s not the only one capable of planting a hook. “Affliction” turns its imprecation into an indelible if understated chorus. “Ghosts of a Dead Empire”, a send-up of missions for purity and perfection, doesn’t necessarily have a refrain, but its conclusion is memorable and haunting. Vernon’s tune moves evenly with the blown-out riff, matched by harmonies and the emphatic wallop of the rhythm section. It’s a moment of post-metal triumph, with splendor and volume spiraling into one radiant climax. </p>
<p>SubRosa’s first two albums were strong testaments from a doom band with an interesting lineup and manifest interests outside of metal. On <i>More Constant than the Gods</i>, they’ve not only managed to synthesize those enthusiasms but to do so while this strange tangle of musicians works <i>together</i>—unselfishly and with complete subservience to the bigger picture of song, statement, and album. There’s folk storytelling and alt-rock worthy choruses, doom intensity and classical grandeur. It’s hard not to be caught up in the incredible power of SubRosa’s sounds and the wide-screen permanence of their songs.  </p></div>"|18395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18395-subrosa-more-constant-than-the-gods/|8.3|Grayson Currin

Information moved more slowly, recordings took more time to produce, and there were layers of cultural gatekeepers to be navigated in the process, so subcultures that craved obscurity could usually find it. The internet and digital recording technology have changed that. Now, if your timing’s right, you can see a specific synth sound or drum programming technique make its way from some nobody producer’s SoundCloud page to pop radio in maybe a couple of months, but sometimes in just weeks.</p>
<p>The shadowy postdubstep underground bass music scene, for instance, is currently finding itself thrust into the spotlight by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>, and their legions of followers who've adopted increasingly dark-toned aesthetic identities informed by artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28873-sbtrkt/"" target=""_blank"">SBTRKT</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"" target=""_blank"">Arca</a>. This scrutiny and appropriation will only intensify in the wake of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"" target=""_blank"">Lorde</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18614-lorde-pure-heroine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pure Heroine</i></a>, which transmuted minimalist bass music that would've qualified as avant garde only a few months ago into chart gold. So what does a musical community with a preference for operating under the pop-cultural radar do when mainstream artists start knocking it off for parts? The smartest and most productive thing would be to launch its own competing, alternative product: And now it has, in the form of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"" target=""_blank"">Kelela Mizanekristos</a>.</p>
<p>Raised in the Maryland suburbs around D.C. on a diet of 1990s pop-R&amp;B divas before relocating to the bustling L.A. bass scene, Kelela is attempting to do what dozens of top-tier singers, songwriters, and producers are also trying, which is to take the moody sounds of the sorts of electronic musicians orbiting club nights/labels/collectives like Night Slugs and Fade to Mind, and give them a more pop-friendly spin that will appeal to listeners who don’t normally go in for severely dark dance music.</p>
<p>Unlike other singers working at similar aims, Kelela is tight enough with the Fade to Mind/Night Slugs crews to collaborate with them directly, so her beats come straight from the source: Bok Bok, Nguzunguzu, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29250-girl-unit/"" target=""_blank"">Girl Unit</a>, FtM founder <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28578-kingdom/"" target=""_blank"">Kingdom</a>, and other affiliated artists who’ve helped define a booming, severely stripped-down sound pieced together from bits of techno, grime, R&amp;B, drum &amp; bass, and dubstep’s pre-neon days. It’s well-constructed launchpad that she’s acquired for herself, and she doesn’t waste it.</p>
<p><i>Cut 4 Me</i> is an ambitiously catchy record as well as being an aesthetically ambitious one. Essential to this is Kelela’s decision to play against the beats' moodiness—that juxtaposition drives the album’s likability. The beat by NA for “Do It Again” is horror-movie creepy, with a hypnotic John Carpenter-like keyboard figure looping over booming haunted house drums, which she decided to use as the foundation for an slow-motion sex jam straight out of the Aaliyah playbook. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29623-nguzunguzu/"" target=""_blank"">Nguzunguzu</a>-produced “Enemy” is as twitchily abrasive as the most staunchly underground first-wave dubstep, so she tops it with a cotton-candy pop-R&amp;B vocal that could have been lifted from a turn of the millennium Brandy B-side.</p>
<p>Kelela’s an unlikely diva for a scene that’s attracted more than its share of dance music purists who don’t go in for frippery like vocalists, but it works. She also needs to close some of the gap between her ambition and what her voice is capable of—it’s a perfectly good voice, but lacks much of the expressiveness and power that singers who don’t come by those things naturally need time to develop. But this kind of works, too. A full-blast diva would obliterate the subtlety that the beats rely on, and the spunky-newcomer charisma that her performance projects imparts crucial warmth to their icy sounds.</p>
<p>The voice can be worked on, though. The more important things that <i>Cut 4 Me</i> teaches us about Kelela are that she has the taste to pick out a fantasy all-star team of collaborators, the talent to make herself heard over their beats, and the intelligence to get it all together at the exact right moment. That’s all instinct, and that can’t be learned. If she wants pop stardom—if not the five-star kind like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a>, then at least the cultishly-adored kind like her former tourmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"" target=""_blank"">Solange</a>—she couldn’t be in a better place.</p></div>"|18661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18661-kelela-cut-4-me/|8.3|Miles Raymer

Manifest destiny, the romance of wide open plains and broken landscapes, get rich quick schemes, and old-fashioned wandering. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2714-cass-mccombs/"" target=""_blank"">Cass McCombs</a>’ seventh full-length album, <i>Big Wheel and Others, </i>takes root in this fertile soil of Americana, crafting a sprawling cosmology out of its characters from the past two centuries. When <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/articles/cass-mccombs,59276/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I interviewed McCombs in 2011</a> around the time of <i>Wit’s End</i>, he confessed a fixation on northern California’s history of “drugs, gunslingers, and gold.” Where he took this fixation two years later reveals all one needs to know about the wry, reclusive singer-songwriter.</p>
<p><i>Wheel </i>opens with a child’s voice, blithely talking about his drug use. This turns out to be an audio clip from <i>Sean</i>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULujCvXQ8Xc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a 1969 documentary </a>about a 4-year-old raised by Haight-Ashbury hippies. In McCombs’ mind Sean isn’t a tragic figure, however, but a stand-in for the unregulated San Francisco of the acid-testing 1960s. For McCombs, Sean’s creepily unregulated upbringing aligns with a broader history of the Wild West, like the Gold Rush’s ruthless Barbary Coast district from a century earlier, and the shiftless drifters populating highway on-ramps and truck stops to this day.</p>
<p>An eight-minute run on Side 2 encapsulates much of <i>Wheel</i>’s own mythology. In another edited movie clip, after solidly affirming that “there’s no God around,” because “the whole world is the Indians’ world,” Sean is prompted for his thoughts on America. “You know America,” he replies. “Half of the world.” For McCombs, such a naïve assertion isn’t cause to rail against patriotic chauvinism, but a perfect segue into the languid Roger McGuinn-style folk-rock of “Home on the Range”. An original composition, “Range” references the 19th century ode to life in Kansas, rumbling with cattle and surrounded by the infinite horizons of what at the time was the American West—and for residents, the entire world. The idea that Sean in 1969 shares a shrunken worldview with a Romantic 1870s rancher is not lost on McCombs. Much of <i>Wheel</i> emanates from this notion: the size of one’s world, and the shape of one’s belief system, equates to imagination plus experience.</p>
<p>Appropriately for an album with such broad aims, <i>Wheel</i> itself is sprawling. With an 85-minute runtime, it covers most most of the musical themes and narrative fixations McCombs has drawn upon since his 2003 debut<i>. </i>Since that time, he’s quietly become one of America’s finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk. Over the last decade, McCombs has been a remarkably consistent, if not publicity-averse, singer-songwriter, comparable to Bill Callahan and Will Oldham as our foremost translators of Old, Weird America into modern terms (and vice-versa). Appropriately, then, the lead character of “Range” is not taken with the beauty of his surroundings, but in a milder form of lawnessness. “I believe in littering,” he croons to open the song. “Waste should not be hidden, but seen.”</p>
<p>Musically, McCombs mixes light and dark in a similar way. His songs are often cast with an eerie serenity, emanating both from his soft vocals and fondness for guitar-led arrangements that glide between sections. His songs are often very pretty, though always invested with a palpable, if not quite visible, sense of foreboding. This  befits the characters of <i>Wheel</i>, most of whom are alone—some desperately so—and seeking redemption, if not simply trying to prove something to themselves. A sweet, loping love song is set between a couple “broken down for days at a free motel/ under the Oregon ridge.” On the brooding lament “My Name Written in Water”, McCombs trails a character escaping the suburbs for time spent amongst the ancient majesty of Utah mesas. Quoting Hamlet’s time-worn soliloquy on mortality, he’s concerned not with where to get gas, but with how the words he’s writing will represent him after he’s gone.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, McCombs packs the album full of outsize, masculine characters in the mold of “Lionkiller”. Early along the tracklist is the swaggering trucker of “Big Wheel” who bags lot lizards and spouts idioms like bumper stickers (“A man is bolts, a man is rust/ For a little while, then the man is dust”). There’s “Joe Murder”, a Coen Brothers-style telling of “Cortez the Killer”, on which McCombs uncoils a sinister guitar lead grumbling with intensity, while shaping the titular drug-runner through his personality quirks. Joe Murder “cut with milk sugar, to eliminate cost,” to which McCombs adds: “such a frugal drifter.” Then there’s the shit-talking narrator of “Satan is My Toy”, letting loose a series of randy, schoolyard-quality couplets, eliding curse word punchlines and relying on the listener to fill in the blanks. It’s McCombs in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave</a> drag, and the kind of song you’d expect to hear pour out of a biker bar when a fight erupts into the alley through the front doors.</p>
<p>These songs have more muscle than the typical McCombs song, with “Wheel” chugging like V-12 pistons, and “Satan” smoldering with sticky saxophone smears. This befits their subject matter as well as the vibe of the album, on which McCombs plays with genre more explicitly than usual. This wide-ranging approach seems to be one of <i>Wheel</i>’s guiding principles, only once resulting in an eyebrow-raising inclusion, when<b> </b>halfway through the album he drops a fairly inexplicable three-and-a-half minute jazz-rock instrumental. Coming from McCombs, who ended <i>PREfection</i> with six-plus minutes of ambient car-alarm and then opened <i>Dropping the Writ</i> two years later with the <i>same sound</i> fading out, such a move should be expected, if not honored. Likely he’s giving us an intermission. </p>
<p>As taken as he is with the American West as a stark, limitless canvas for his characters to make their own, it’s likely McCombs has an affinity for Bobby Dupea, the volatile, shiftless oil-well rigger from 1970’s <i>Five Easy Pieces</i>. Dupea has everything he could want, but discards it all in fits of selfishness and unacknowledged confusion as he drives from California to Washington. Foremost among those left behind is Dupea’s girlfriend Rayette Dipesto, a Tammy Wynette-worshipping waitress and the film’s saddest character. Karen Black was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Rayette, though it’s likely that a generation discovered her 40 years later, through her haunting vocals on <i>Catacombs</i>’ “Dreams-Come-True-Girl”.</p>
<p>Black died this past August, and McCombs not only dedicated <i>Wheel </i>to her memory, but gave her the lead on the second of the album’s two versions of “Brighter!” Musically, the song bears mid-tempo similarities to the Orbisonian theater of “Dreams-Come-True-Girl”, though it differs thematically. At once, “Brighter!” is a spiritual invocation and a melancholy tale of a directionless life. “I stopped in for a little while, and learned a host of sins,” Black sings in her highest register. “I wandered off a little while, because you can never win.” Somewhere within the 74-year-old Black’s delivery on this couplet lies a strong hint as to McCombs’ complex moral universe: if you stop moving too long, you won’t like what you learn.</p></div>"|18612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18612-cass-mccombs-big-wheel-and-others/|7.9|Eric Harvey

Groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> boast rabid fanbases yet get raked over the coals—much of the time by those same fans. But, perhaps none of the aforementioned groups have seen the kind of ""Crossfire""-level handwringing as Chicago's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3472-pelican/"" target=""_blank"">Pelican</a>. Couple the group's four-year hiatus with the fact that they often toe a line that dips into metal territory—another style that claims adherents quick to nitpick—and you’ve got a recipe for controversy. But, on <i>Forever Becoming</i>’s second track, Pelican seem to be issuing a gag order of sorts. Two minutes into “Deny the Absolute”, it’s apparent that the band is as heavy and anthemic as ever. Pelican can’t hear you above the din.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Deny the Absolute” is a remarkable song with an even more striking center. It chugs along ominously and fiercely like something Colonel Kilgore might have selected to play after “Ride of the Valkyries”. It’s utterly thrilling, a testament to Pelican’s present unity. Oft-maligned drummer Larry Herweg keeps a tight beat, while his brother, Bryan, unleashes a thrusting bass assault. And, to reiterate, it is heavy: the kind of track that a baseball closer might be wise to adopt as entry music.</p>
<p>It’s the pinnacle of <i>Forever Becoming</i>, but the record has other worthwhile moments. “The Tundra” paces forward with a vigorous clip and ignites in its last minute. It’s further testimony that Pelican are at their best in synced-up moments. “Immutable Dusk” is more ruminative, splitting the difference between the sounds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"" target=""_blank"">Explosions in the Sky</a> and, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"" target=""_blank"">Neurosis</a>. (Most of the song titles on <i>Forever Becoming</i> could be easily mistaken for lost Sylvia Plath poems or, at least, the wall scribblings of a Sarah Lawrence College sophomore. As a recent press release ponderously reports: “<i>Forever Becoming</i> is an immense, speaker-rattling meditation on the infinite cycle of death and life.”) “Dusk” is followed by another epic, “Threnody”, which adeptly explores the poles between quiet and noise.</p>
<p>Many instrumental bands exploit builds, and while Pelican do so with tact, you can be left wanting more variation and exploration. “Threnody” moves from tickled picking into a teamed-up crescendo. It’s a trip, the quartet—which includes guitarists Trevor de Brauw and Dallas Thomas—strumming as quickly as possible. Still, it’s all a bit familiar. Haven’t others plotted out this territory previously and more effectively? And, further, hasn’t Pelican? Certainly, a track like “Autumn Into Summer”, from 2005’s <i>Fire In Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw</i>, uses its nearly 11 minutes to expertly showcase a raw and bold post-rock. The layered guitars on it (one of them is played by Laurent Schroeder-Lebec, who departed the band last year and was replaced by Swan King’s Thomas) converse and converge with each other in a way not found on <i>Forever Becoming. </i></p>
<p>Pelican’s harder sound makes such earlier developments hazy. Yet, the band comes back to them awkwardly. The album’s closer, “Perpetual Dawn”, is a dead-ringer for a tune Mogwai would choose to cap an LP or show. But it’s that fact—that Mogwai or Godspeed or Explosions could be playing it—which is troubling. It’s an oversimplification to declare that a share of post-rock “sounds the same” but, sometimes, Pelican suffers from being too weighed down by its roots. That said, when Pelican rages—in a way they never have before—they prove they still have plenty of life left.</p></div>"|18662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18662-pelican-forever-becoming/|7.2|Colin St. John

Anyone coming to his recent music cold at this point would be justified in finding that description baffling, although it's important to understand his fondness for artistic rebirth. Dresselhaus toyed with the poppy side of glitchtronica on his 2002 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7027-zoomer/""><i>Zoomer</i></a>, a record that remains the best known work in his canon. <i>Guitar Sounds</i> is about as far away from that as you can get, instead emphasizing his aptitude for drone oriented pieces, improvisation, and explorations on the margins of music. Dresselhaus isn't too interested in formal musical constructs, as highlighted on the album he released directly before this one, the self-explanatory <i>Construction Sounds</i>. ""Whatever makes sound can be music,"" he told the Quietus in a recent <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/13432-schneider-tm-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. ""But many things that count as music are not.""</p>
<p>Unravelling the oblique statements Dresselhaus makes in interviews is analogous to the experience of listening to his music. <i>Guitar Sounds</i> has the air of a code that can't be deciphered, or a puzzle with a few pieces missing. The fact that all the music is wrung out of a guitar is practically irrelevant-- this is the kind of piece that works best when it causes you to forget about the world. Getting hung up on how parts were formed, how shapes were made, is a shade of removal too far from its waves of noise. Not that this is a ""noise"" record, per se. Mostly it's only loosely defined, oscillating between parts that resemble the sparse neo-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Morricone</a> pieces of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>'s <i>Dead Man</i> soundtrack and manipulations that cause Dresselhaus' strumming to resemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1332-warren-ellis/"">Warren Ellis</a>' emotive violin playing in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"">Dirty Three</a>. At other times he sounds like a squeaky bedpost. Somehow, he ties this all together in a way that follows a curious kind of logic.</p>
<p>Mostly <i>Guitar Sounds</i> feels like a throwback to the 90s, specifically to the point when artists loosely bracketed under the post-rock banner were gaining critical traction. There's no adherence to rhythm here in the way that, say, the best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> work had, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1795-david-grubbs/"">David Grubbs</a>' playing in <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/artists/gastr-del-sol"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gastr del Sol</a> comes to mind at times, particularly in the moments where Dresselhaus sounds like he's engaged in a struggle against his instrument, purposefully making it do exactly what it's not designed to do. The difference is that it felt like Grubbs was building an aesthetic on albums like <i>Crookt, Crackt, or Fly</i>, where he found a suitable place to bed down in for a while. Dresselhaus picks things up and discards them quickly, even shifting into work that resembles his own placid electronic pieces. There's not a great deal of focus here, no overall thrust to cling onto. It's like watching someone ghost through styles, only notionally getting to grips with them.</p>
<p>Something that connects this work and <i>Construction Sounds</i> is the grating edge that Dresselhaus adds. <i>Guitar Sounds</i> has a decent amount of industrial grind stirred into its pallet, with the guitar reconfigured as a power tool, spraying disharmony in its wake. Still, it's a feeling that is, at times, a little too similar to the one explored by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"">Einstürzende Neubauten</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a> several decades earlier, where all of music's ugly entrails are bled out. When Dresselhaus goes down that route it sets a wildly uneven tone, somewhere between entrancing and aimless, with certain facets of music history bearing down just a little too hard on his shoulder for it to become fully dislocating. <i>Guitar Sounds</i> works primarily as a series of exercises, and it's hard not to feel that it could have been so much more than that, especially in those moments where Dresselhaus unties his brain from the world and follows his intuition.</p></div>"|18522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18522-schneider-tm-guitar-sounds/|6.4|Nick Neyland

He hasn't been invisible—far from it, thanks to the benefit of DJing in L.A. club circles and on internet radio. But his debut full-length <i>Timescales</i> comes as a surprise, albeit a kind of scattershot and amorphous one. It's largely because it synthesizes so many familiar pieces so well—abstracted West Coast G-funk, reverbed microhouse, vintage-Hyperdub space bass—that it leaves no clue as to where his further directions could even go. It's a rare moment of fully-formed emergence from a musician who's more or less announcing himself to the wider world with a pastiche that sounds like an endpoint, the kind of thing that comes from a decade's worth of evolution rather than the breakthrough release of someone who's practically unfindable on Discogs right now.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The big ""what next"" can wait, though. Even if <i>Timescales</i> threatens to revert to weathered ideas of what it means to hybridize the last few innovations in L.A.-via-wherever underground dance music, <i></i>the record makes no pretense of acting like it's a forward-thinking revolution. Deco shows off that DJ/curator's sense of knowing his context and history and how to merge those ideas into something evocative, even if it's not necessarily evocative of something you haven't heard before. In short, it's comfort sound for beat heads.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Working with a bunch of known quantities doesn't keep <i>Timescales</i> from actually harboring some subtle resonance or deeper feeling, however. Bait-and-switch is a crucial part of the formula, as expectations dredged up by the best songs' early moments are gradually twisted around or otherwise tweaked in mood-altering ways. ""Skyline 3040"" teems with ambient digital-mechanical bleeps and burbles, anticipating some glimmery future-kitsch manipulation of cyberpunk landscape as Apple-interface utopia—until the deep buzzing chords come in and cast a harsher, lonelier light on its gradually intensifying Kode9-lineage snares. That dynamic cuts the other way, too, the looming dread of ""Late Night Fading"" breaking apart and settling into tranquility thanks to a canny sample flip of Cymande's ""Dove"" that plays up its guitar tone's floaty qualities.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given enough comfortable genre signifiers to work with, Deco has a lot of precedent he can manipulate to unexpected ends. At least, he does when it suits him—sometimes, going right down the middle with a straightforward take on dark, stripped-down dubstep (""Musical Family"", ""Trenchtown"") or coolly simmering deep house (""At Most Sphere"", ""Power Transfer"") is effective enough. But it's clear that the more leftfield moments work best, balancing out subtle, technical grooves with jolting chords that find anxiety somewhere in the soulfulness. Zone in on the hypnotic, dubbed-out buildups that lead State Route 1 to Studio One on ""Cali Trunk Rattle"" or the title track's bracing incorporation of tight-packed drumline fills, and the odd minor-key synth hits and slippery counter-beats can bolt right out at you. A few more cuts like those, where thematic about-faces and joy-buzzer fills are snuck in under the cover of tradition-minded accessibility, and Deco could turn out to be some kind of low-key iconoclast.</p></div>"|18628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18628-deco-timescales/|7.3|Nate Patrin

Gutty and tuff, ""Kool FM"" appropriated the name of a legendary pirate radio station that existed during the rave and jungle era, abstracting that era's chopter rhythms and throaty MCs. Kieran Hebden has developed a bit of a johnny-come-lately reputation among certain observers, though, his plunges into UK bass music viewed as harmless and well meaning but perhaps a bit awkward. ""Kool FM"" seemed to be the latest instance of Hebden chasing dance music's tail: over the last 12 or so months, many artists returned to the breakbeat-based club music—popularized in the UK in the early and mid 90s—whose rhythms are sourced from funky, sampled drum breaks rather than from more rigid and electronic drum synthesizers. Even amongst those who sought only to commemorate jungle, rather than recreate or refine it, Hebden <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/37-false-jungle-memories/"" target=""_blank"">might've been late</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But if Hebden has been hopping trends, he's been doing so fruitfully. ""Love Cry"", from 2010's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13861-there-is-love-in-you/"" target=""_blank""><i>There Is Love in You</i></a>, became an actual club hit, as did several of the tracks from last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17093-pink/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pink</i></a>, a compilation of extended, dance-friendly singles. Hebden found a way to adhere to dance music's strictures and conventions while still applying his sun-dappled psychedelia, stretching his easy melodic ideas over terse rhythms and rubbery basslines. <i>Pink</i> was ""Four Tet does dance music"" but, hey! Four Tet's doing dance music!</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Likewise, <i>Beautiful Rewind</i> borrows without apology from a trend but sounds undeniably like a Four Tet record. Jungle, with its mighty musical appetite and don't-give-a-fuck sampling culture, might be a nice fit for Four Tet, whose music has always relied heavily on samples. Crucially, it's not jungle's mangled breakbeats that interest Hebden so much as its MCs: sound-system junkies shouting up the DJs, themselves, or just babbling rhythmically. These gruff utterances run counterpoint to Hebden's beatific melodies and cooing female voices. There's plenty of friction: jungle and rave famously threw traditional notions of good musical taste out the window, while Hebden's output, with its patient tunefulness and cordial radiance, is nothing if not tasteful.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Beautiful Rewind</i> echoes the ephemeral aspects of jungle, the infectious rush of the new, the patter of voices through radio static, rather than the functional signifiers—quickening tempos, mangled breakbeats—that defined it. The album serves as a compact, romantic remembrance: prettier, milder, and less funky than its inspiration. It also feels very personal, like these moments are Hebden's own recollections, his own tangential relationship with a subculture. Where albums like <i>There Is Love in You</i> and <i>Rounds</i> felt inviting, loving even, <i>Beautiful Rewind</i> sometimes seems like it's drawing connections that mean more to Hebden than they ever will to us.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Take, for instance, late-album stormers ""Buchla"" and ""Aerial"", which masterfully integrate sampled MCs into their herky-jerky rhythms but fail to complement ""Unicorn""'s shimmering pools of melody. The stirring, chaotic opener ""Gong"" recalls Hebden's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27812-burial-and-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">collaborations</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, but its steamy urban roughage is cleansed by ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16039-parallel-jalebi/"" target=""_blank"">Parallel Jalebi</a>""'s tidy thrum. It's during transitions like these when <i>Rewind</i> comes unstitched, when it feels more like a small bundle of Four Tet productions than an album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At just over 40 minutes, <i>Beautiful Rewind</i> is an effortless listen, but when it wanders it feels like a bauble, one from an artist from whom we are accustomed to receiving richer gifts. Hebden has previously turned a lack of precision into broad, idyllic albums, but <i>Beautiful Rewind</i> feels as though it's circling, cautiously looking for a place to land. There are still plenty of treats, especially when those jungle MCs are able to unmoor Hebden from his default state of bliss-y, pastoral expanse. <i>Beautiful Rewind</i> is staked on the past, but for as much flack as Hebden takes for repeating what other artists have already done, <i>Rewind</i> falters most when Hebden does little more than repeat himself.</p></div>"|18649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18649-four-tet-beautiful-rewind/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

Will Oldham played everything himself, recorded it himself, released it himself, and even distributed it himself <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/dXuhXaFi4F/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">by hand</a> to record stores. Most significantly, the music on <i>Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy </i>exudes an individual perspective—nearly every song is written in the first person, and Oldham’s spare acoustic guitar, breathy vocals, and close-up production form a contemplative inner monologue.</p>
<p>There’s one more bit of self about <i>Bonnie “Prince” Billy</i> that’s important: the fact that Oldham decided to make it self-titled. The last time he went that route was on 1994’s <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_in_the_Wake"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Palace Brothers</a> </i>(later re-titled <i>Days in the Wake</i>). That was also the last time he made a full-length album with, for the most part, just his voice and acoustic guitar. The result was one of the finest records in his oeuvre, a suite of intimate sketches studded with now-classics like “Pushkin” and “I Am A Cinematographer"". He must’ve thought of that album while making this one<i>, </i>and when judged against its predecessor <i>Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy</i> measures up quite well.</p>
<p>That’s due partially to how perfectly the solo acoustic format fits Oldham’s melding of vocals and lyrics. He weaves them together so tightly that it’s hard to tell singer from song, and that’s clearest when it’s just him and a guitar. His voice shakes, stretches and cracks around notes, approaching rather than hitting them, and his words similarly skirt themes and flirt with meaning. Concrete ideas and images emerge, but nothing is ever so defined that a single interpretation is clear. Often my first impression of a song flips on subsequent listen, when one bent note or one turn of phrase that I didn’t notice before makes me rethink the rest. At best Oldham’s songs are powerfully ambiguous, and that’s true of all of them on <i>Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy</i>.</p>
<p>This time around, Oldham finds ambiguity in the elusive concept of the self—what it is, how it changes, how it will end. A few of these tunes<i> </i>are ostensibly about relationships, but even those center on the self and its struggle to connect. “I see you go on/ and I go too, but not with you,” Oldham sings in the album’s second song, “Lessons from Stony"",  his voice rising with caution. On the next tune, “Triumph of Will"", he laments that he and his partner are “never lost together… We are two separate people/ We never will be one.” By song’s end the couple have willed their way to unity, but it’s a triumph that doesn’t last long.</p>
<p>From there, Oldham<i> </i>becomes increasingly pessimistic about love. “All our hearts are stained and every love is tainted,” he declares at one point, and later “there is no heaven for love, it simply dies.” He also becomes increasingly obsessed with mortality, both fascinated and terrified by death of the self. On “I Will Be Born Again” he sings the title repetitively as if trying to convince himself of the impossible. On the deceptively upbeat “This is My Cocktail” he admits fearing two things: “losing my mind, losing my body.” And by the time of “Ending it All (As I Do),” he sounds resigned: “the beginning of ending is already done.” Throughout these musings, his guitar winds around like a stream of consciousness, shifting between simple melodies and looser, less certain structures.</p>
<p>It may sound like <i>Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy </i>is an intense listen, but much of it is also spry and catchy, and some of it is pretty funny too. One song about a pig kept in a chest at the foot of a bed plays like a surrealist cartoon, and even when Oldham is staring at death, he stays wry and absurd, dropping humorous motifs throughout. A particularly amusing one is his persistent use of the word “fun,” which is held up as a kind of life-goal holy grail. But its attainment is always uncertain, which gives the album tension.</p>
<p>That uncertainty, and Oldham’s sense of the self as constant flux, also give <i>Bonnie ""Prince’""Billy</i> a Zen feel—and, by the end, a meditative calm. Closer “Royal Quiet Deluxe” describes driving down a highway to escape a failed relationship, but also to meet something greater. “If we die many times, then let death come to me,” he sings spiritedly—and then suddenly switches into a upbeat epilogue. “This is the last song of its kind,” he croons as if he’s peacefully accepted his demise, or moved on to something new. It’s one of the most sublime moments in a musical career already full of them—and it ends with the album’s sunniest line: “Ain’t it the best?” Once you’ve taken this fascinating journey with Oldham, it’s hard not to agree.</p></div>"|18650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18650-bonnie-prince-billy-bonnie-prince-billy/|7.8|Marc Masters

She reveals this detail and further underachiever credentials in a long, charismatically ambling song off her double EP <i>A Sea of Split Peas</i>, called ""Are You Looking After Yourself."" The song—which pairs a few jangly chords with Barnett’s lazy-Tuesday drawl—alternates between the questions of a concerned parent (""Are you working hard my darling?/ We’re so worried"") and Barnett’s libertine responses (""I don’t want no 9 to 5/ Telling me that I’m alive/ And 'Man, you’re doing well!'""). About halfway through, Barnett’s guilty conscience emerges: Maybe she <i>should </i>get a job, or a husband, or at the very least a dog.

<p>Barnett is 25 years old and from Melbourne, Australia; when she sings ""My friends play in bands, they are better than everything on radio,"" she is likely referring to the roster of <a href=""http://www.milkrecords.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Milk Records</a>, ""a little independent label"" she started running out of her bedroom last year. Milk’s first release was Barnett’s debut EP <i>I’ve Got a Friend Called Emily Ferris</i>, which she’s now combined with her 2013 EP <i>How to Carve a Carrot into a Rose</i> and re-released under the characteristically long-winded name <i>The Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas</i>. The 12 songs in this collection are often wordy, articulate, and dazzlingly witty, but they’re always down-to-earth; Barnett comes across like a slightly less urbane <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2590-jens-lekman/"">Jens Lekman</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8565-eleanor-friedberger/"">Eleanor Friedberger</a> if her songs took place not in bustling cities but in small, sleepy towns. ""It’s a Monday, it’s so mundane,"" Barnett sighs in a hilarious deadpan on <i>Split Peas</i>’ best song, ""Avant Gardener"". ""What exciting things will happen today?""</p>
<p>The irony, though, is that the song soon becomes quite exciting. Barnett has a gift for turning mundane scenarios into gripping stories—she animates each one with genial asides and jokey tangents, like she’s recounting it for you at the pub later that night. ""Avant Gardener"" chronicles an ill-fated attempt to get some gardening done in a heat wave, and ends with Barnett having a panic attack in the back of an ambulance (""The paramedic thinks I’m clever cos I play guitar/ I think she’s clever cos she stops people dying."") Another standout, ""History Eraser"", has a similar momentum, but this time Barnett doesn’t even have to get out of bed: It describes a breathless, drunken daydream in which Barnett and the object of her affection joyride on a tractor, catch a riverboat to a casino, and spontaneously sprout straw where their hair used to be—all to the tune of some rollicking, 1960s-inspired folk. It might as well be called <a href=""http://vimeo.com/35540786"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Courtney Barnett’s 115th Dream""</a>.</p>
<p>As the more up-beat numbers prove, Barnett’s comically eponymous (""Courtney Barnett and the Courtney Barnetts"") backing band complements her style perfectly: they match the frontwomans’ shambling energy without taking the emphasis off her clever lyrics. A few of <i>Split Peas</i>’ slower, older songs [“Porcelain”, “Canned Tomatoes (Whole)”] do stall the momentum, but Barnett herself says she didn’t conceive the collection as a cohesive statement. ""I don’t want people to misinterpret it as an album,"" she said <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9230-courtney-barnett/"">in a recent Pitchfork interview</a>, ""An album is a thing you take time out and go work on. I can’t wait to make an album. I’ve got a bunch of songs half-ready to go, and I might start on it early next year."" Classic slacker rhetoric, maybe, but on this occasionally brilliant (pre-)debut Barnett proves there’s more to the stereotype than meets the eye. When you’ve got an imagination this wild, who even needs a TV?</p></div>"|18641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18641-courtney-barrett-the-double-lp-a-sea-of-split-peas/|7.8|Lindsay Zoladz

That’s not a criticism—the Brooklyn trio haven’t scored cred points namedropping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur R<span>ó</span>s</a>, but they’ve learned important lessons about how to construct a populist, dramatic, and highly emotive electronic-rock collusion. Though Radiohead is no longer interested in exploring the fertile continuum established from “Fake Plastic Trees” to “Talk Show Host” to “Climbing Up the Walls”, plenty of people still want to hear bands that <i>are</i> and Antlers have been rightfully rewarded. But this stylistic consistency is problematic for School of Night, a solo project started by their resident producer/multi-instrumentalist Darby Cicci. As it turns out, the music he makes inside Antlers isn’t all that different than the music he makes outside Antlers, and against his main band’s lofty standards, <i>School of Night</i> doesn’t make much of an argument to disrupt the status quo.</p>
<p>He’d make a good substitute for Peter Silberman in a pinch, though. Cicci doesn’t attempt to recreate Silberman’s hackles-raising falsetto, but otherwise, his vocals are nearly identical to those of the Antlers’ frontman in their lower register—a quavering tone that signifies a resilience through a good deal of internal emotional bruising. Moreover, <i>School of Night</i> perfectly dovetails the last two releases of new Antlers music. You don’t get much of the explosive catharsis that signified <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13196-hospice/"">Hospice</a></i>, but rather the streamlined, nocturnal melancholy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15411-burst-apart/""><i>Burst Apart</i></a> combined with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16860-undersea/"">Undersea</a></i>’s unmoored song structures. The shortest track on<i> School of Night</i> is five and a half minutes, and though only a five-song EP, it’s barely shorter than <i>Burst Apart</i>.</p>
<p>If you’re stretching to find substantial differences between School of Night and Cicci’s day gig, the most crucial is how much it truly sounds like the work of one guy tinkering around after hours. Appropriately enough, this also described the way Antlers albums were made up until <i>Hospice</i> and it’s likely the reason most people still think Silberman's third LP is his band's debut. Cicci does have a handful ideas that could’ve evolved into something more grand, as there are some intriguing parts on which he could base a worthy verse, middle eight, or instrumental coda: see the slowly swaying melody of “Lying”, the unquantized rhythmic judder of “Doktor”, the way “Vacuum” combines the exploratory post-rock of later Talk Talk with the synthesizers of their pop days. But all of these are revealed within the first minute or so ,and most of <i>School of Night</i> becomes loops within loops, songs that still feel trapped within Cicci’s laptop and badly needing some kind of impetus to knock them out of their holding pattern, whether it’s a real-deal chorus or just <i>some</i> kind of dynamic shift.</p>
<p>More than melody or velocity, what <i>School of Night</i> most crucially lacks is urgency, a sense that this project <i>needed</i> to happen for Cicci. The sluggish tempos (the liveliest track here is called “Play Dead”) and overall tenor of the lyrics suggest some sort of bloodletting, but the severity is never revealed. Rather than establishing coherent narratives, Cicci leans on foreboding, plainspoken lines like “I’m not a doctor”, “keep your eyes on the road”, repeated in a way that tries to establish resonance or layer meaning but instead stresses a disconnect from the rest of the lyrics.</p>
<p>Or, maybe even more than urgency, <i>School of Night</i> needs drama, whether emotional or instrumental; the exact things that make Antlers stand out above similarly sad-eyed synth-indie acts such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28973-porcelain-raft/"">Porcelain Raft</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29094-yellow-ostrich/"">Yellow Ostrich</a>, both of whom Cicci produced. Consider the difference between <i>School of Night'</i>s “Fire Escape” and “Corsicana”, a highlight from <i>Burst Apart</i>. Both are lovely ballads about a codependent relationship submitting to a literal and figurative slow burn; both take place in a house ablaze. On “Corsicana”, the romantic sacrifice of its narrator feels downright apocalyptic, but such stakes are never really established on “Fire Escape”. Cicci moans, “I will stay unless I know/ The fire escape is just for show” and it’s indicative of <i>School of Night</i>’s ability to suggest a certain magnitude to its creator without being able to fully express it to the listener.</p></div>"|18642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18642-school-of-night-school-of-night-ep/|5.5|Ian Cohen

<p>Formed in 2006, Cave has cycled through two cities—relocating to Chicago from Columbia, Missouri—and a number of musicians, but its sound has remained fairly consistent. The quartet draws heavy inspiration from German experimental rock music of the late 60s and early 70s, particularly rhythm-driven outfits like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"" target=""_blank"">Neu!</a>. Cave’s compositions are sprawling, but tightly focused, employing simple major-key melodies to sustain the rhythms section’s hypnotic grooves. On previous LPs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13071-psychic-psummer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Psychic Psummer</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15921-cave-neverendless/"" target=""_blank""><i>Neverendless</i></a>, the band perfectly emulated its idols—nailing the recording techniques, the tonalities, and the playing style of continental Europe’s finest vintage head-music.</p>
<p>On <i>Threace, </i>the group’s second full-length for Drag City, Cave’s heart still beats to the motorik pulse, but they’ve broadened out their repertoire to include some of the other groovy, stoney sounds of the 70s.</p>
<p>“Arrow’s Myth” begins with a driving groove, but the guitars quickly give way to a rhodes-driven ambient zone-out that carries more than a whiff of fusion-era Miles Davis. “Silver Headband” opens with odd-time krautrock homage, but the heavy rave-up that closes the song owes some of its steely grind to progressive blues rock records.</p>
<p>Cave’s music is rooted in minimalism and the band has never been guilty of over-playing, but on <i>Threace</i>, the group holds back even more than usual. In the past, the band relied heavily on loud-soft dynamics to create urgency, pivoting from delicate to distorted in order to drive a song forward. On many of the compositions here, they establish a groove and hover in place. The last third of twelve-minute album opener, “Sweaty Fingers"", is made up of staccato guitars scratching out supplemental percussion for a hi-hat groove. One psychedelic staple that you seldom hear in Cave’s music is echo. Guitarists Jeremy Freeze and Cooper Crain keep their riffs dry, leaving no atmosphere or texture to cloud their interlocking melodies or hide smudged rhythms.   </p>
<p>Because krautrock downplayed harmony in favor of rhythm, the music has a certain mechanical connotations. Yet, it’s never monotonous. The notes are simple and repetitive, but there’s a subtle human feel in the rhythm section that keeps the music flowing forward. It’s an element that many revivalists sideline, because it’s tough to do. Cave nail it, though. On <i>Threace</i>, they prove to be excellent players on a technical level, who can zero in on minute detail and keep stasis interesting. They’re not just guys with really great record collections, they’re excellent musicians.</p></div>"|18631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18631-cave-threace/|7.3|Aaron Leitko

Bassist Eric Axelson formed Maritime with ex-Promise Ringers Davey von Bohlen and Dan Didier, then taught a little English. Drummer Joe Easley works at NASA; guitarist Jason Caddell is a sound engineer around D.C., and frontman Travis Morrison, after a couple solo efforts—one <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10561-all-yall/"">passable</a>, one <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5607-travistan/"">ghastly</a>—temporarily retired from music, got a gig with HuffPo, and joined a choir. Most have married; drummer Joe Easley has a kid. In 2007, the Plan played a pair of benefit shows for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2338-emergency-i/"" target=""_blank""><i>Emergency &amp; I</i> </a>producer/Jawbox guitarist J. Robbins' ailing son Cal, then embarked on a proper tour to coincide with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14979-emergency-i-vinyl-reissue/"" target=""_blank"">rerelease of their landmark <i>Emergency</i> LP</a>. Rehearsals went well, then the songs started to come, and, well, here we are. Going on the piles of pre-release interviews, you might think all these changes, all this Life Stuff, would suffuse <i>Uncanney Valley</i>, the first Dismemberment Plan album in a dozen years, with a newfound maturity; they're not just older now, they're wiser, settled down, no longer mired in the harrowing innervisions and interpersonal dramas of their 20s. Fifteen seconds into <i>Uncanney Valley</i>, that impression starts to falter.</p>
<p>Opener ""No One's Saying Nothing"" gets going with ""You hit the spacebar enough, and cocaine comes out—I really like this computer!"" Closer ""Let's Just Go to the Dogs Tonight"" all but ends with Morrison chanting ""When I say 'cluster,' you say 'fuck.'"" In between, he dines on his fingernails, likens himself to ""a fat man on drugs, drowning in hugs,"" and spouts off on the finer points of Madonna's art collection. These cornball jokes, bizarre tangents, and puzzling half-thoughts dominate <i>Uncanney Valley</i>, the group's long-awaited fifth LP; true, there are moments of clear-eyed introspection on <i>Uncanney Valley</i>, but they're fleeting at best, never quite enough to offset the feeling that Morrison and company have returned after all this time without a whole lot to say. Any promises of newfound maturity are hard to come by on <i>Uncanney Valley</i>, and even if they weren't, the time away has been tremendously unkind to Morrison's wordplay. </p>
<p>All over <i>Uncanney Valley</i>, Morrison—once one of indie rock's most incisive, identifiable lyricists—cracks wise, veers off erratically, shoehorns in dated slang or beside-the-point chanting. ""Well, look who it is—been a little while since you been up in my 'biz,"" he sputters as ""Waiting"" whirrs to a start, coming off like a ""cool dad"" in a lousy sitcom. ""I am not an inhibited man—try to keep it in my pants when I can,"" he admits on lowlight ""White Collar White Trash"", before rattling off a far-too-long list of places he's been ""doin' it in."" ""Daddy Was a Real Good Dancer,"" reportedly inspired by Brian Eno's late-in-life discovery of his father's days as a drummer, hinges around a cringey couplet about ""daddy's happy feet."" What's more, while ""Daddy"" delves into the sacrifices one has to make for parenthood, by focusing on what's lost rather than celebrating what's gained, it's hard to be all that sympathetic. When this stuff isn't merely clunky, it's downright embarrassing, and on <i>Uncanney Valley</i>, it's just about everywhere. Morrison's never wanted for confidence, but much of <i>Uncanney Valley</i> plays out as if no one was willing to tell him no. Years ago, he proved incredibly adept at revealing uncomfortable truths: that living around more people can make you feel more alone, that smarts don't always equal satisfaction, that the party you wish they'd let you into is rarely the one you want to be at. But his clumsy, winking delivery throughout the barely revealing, only intermittently relatable <i>Uncanney Valley</i> too often stops short at uncomfortable.</p>
<p>While Morrison flails, the rest of the Plan simmers. Morrison and Caddell's melodies, alternately playful (""Waiting"") and plaintive (""Lookin'""), aren't likely to surprise any Plan loyalists, but they're sturdy enough, packed with slippery little surprises. Rhythmically, though, Uncanney Valley too often feels listless, considerably less driving than even <i>Change</i>'s more muted moments. Easley and Axelson, among indie rock's great low ends, seem relegated to the background, never allowed to explode the way they did so often throughout the Plan's initial run. When they do get a groove going, the music rattles and hums like like the Plan of old, but there's been a considerable downturn in the dramatic left-turns and precipice-taunting rave-ups that played up the tumult in Morrison's once-trenchant lyrics. The glammed-out stomp of ""Go and Get It"" is the set's big outlier; although the song itself, a one-size-fits-all motivational anthem, amounts to little more than one long thumb's up, the music's undeniably rousing. But the rest of <i>Uncanney Valley</i>'s music plays to their strengths without risking enough to build on them, with most of the nuance blotted out by Morrison's overdone delivery.</p>
<p>It's not all bad; ""Invisible"", in particular, is an all-too-rare moment of cuticle-gnawing revelation. Over an escalating string sample, Morrison opens up. ""I thought I'd be working in Midtown, a winner,"" he confesses; instead, he's riding the train from some workaday job to some outer borough, catching the faces of fellow would-be world-beaters in the passing cars. This is the Morrison of ""The Jitters"" or ""Spider in the Snow"" a few years down the line—sharp, self-aware, but still unsure how to get something going. Until he starts in on Madge's Jeff Koons stash, the regrets and remembrances outlined in ""Living in Song"" play a little like an over-the-shoulder sequel to ""The City"". ""Lookin'"" matches a domestic scene to a gentle, chiming groove, as a grateful, satisfied-sounding Morrison considers the kind of love that only gets better with time. Whenever Morrison takes stock of what he's got, the ungainly punchlines and time-wasting chants fall away, revealing lived-in maturity and genuine feeling. But these grown-up sentiments are the exception on <i>Uncanney Valley</i>.</p>
<p>The album was a risk; anytime a much-loved band returns from a long pause and tries to recapture some of the old magic, there's always the chance that they'll come up short. Morrison's desire to take chances is admirable, but his willingness to commit to every lousy idea doesn't make those ideas any easier to take. The still-brilliant <i>Emergency &amp; I</i> and <i>Change</i> were built around the tensions between the people we are and the people we would like to be. But <i>Uncanney Valley</i> seems too bent on interrupting serious moments with corny jokes and bewildering asides to say much of anything about anyone else. Halfway through ""Mexico City Christmas"", Morrison blurts ""Being a poet is a pretty good gig/ You fuck with the best stuff and keep the rest hid."" But Morrison, one time poet laureate of brainy urbanite indie rockers, can barely get through a stanza on <i>Uncanney Valley</i> without tripping over his own words.</p></div>"|18637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18637-the-dismemberment-plan-uncanney-valley/|4.5|Paul Thompson

At first blush it seems to be that most heinous of Boomer cliches, the acoustic Those Were the Days ballad where youth-culture narcissism collides with old-people shmaltz, but fairly quickly the song resolves into something much more interesting. While the verses are a rose-tinted reminiscence of McCartney and John Lennon’s brief period of pre-fame friendship in Liverpool, the choruses project something altogether different: “They can’t take it from me/ if they try/ I lived through those early days.” Whereas most of his hippie-era pop contemporaries enthusiastically embraced self-hagiography decades ago, McCartney’s relationship with nostalgia is complicated, and fraught with skepticism, and by embracing these complications he offers an understandably human portrait of a position few of us will ever find ourselves in: watching your life story being converted into mythology by forces outside of your control.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But really, there isn’t a cut out of the thirteen on <i>New</i> that doesn’t make a compelling argument for McCartney continuing to produce music. As his evolving relationship with shmaltz goes to show, he’s continued to stretch out as an artist long after most artists from his generation slipped into a comfortable rut. While it’s not as radical an aesthetic statement his searingly noisy 2008 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12465-electric-arguments/"" target=""_blank""><i>Electric Arguments</i></a>, his appearance on a recent EDM banger by Bloody Beetroots, or his stint as frontman for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>, it still pushes hard against the popular conception of what a Paul McCartney record’s supposed to sound like, which is a wonderful thing.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>He’s found some enthusiastic partners in this in the album’s four producers, each of whom approaches the collaborative challenge from a different angle. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"" target=""_blank"">Adele</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Florence and the Machine</a> producer Paul Epworth revives the taut, nervy postpunk sound of his early work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"" target=""_blank"">Bloc Party</a> for the album-opening “Save Us"", and injects the single “Queenie Eye” with aggressively punchy compression and generous splashes of noise. Trad-rock specialist Ethan Johns gives two of the album’s acoustic moments, “Early Days” and Hosanna"" an intimacy that’s almost painfully raw. “Alligator” and “New"", the two tracks produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5304-mark-ronson/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Ronson</a>, are the ones that most closely resemble McCartney’s classic work (late-era Beatles and early Wings, respectively) but he’s given them a modern-sounding density. (He also proves his reputation as an expert vocal producer by stacking McCartney’s voice into a multitracked nod to <i>Pet Sounds</i> at the end of “New.”)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Overseeing the whole project is Giles Martin, son of George, who executive produced the album and directly produced half of the songs. Martin, who was responsible for much of the work on the catalog-spanning Beatles remix project </span><i>Love</i><span>, has a natural sense for finding the right balance between McCartney’s sonic ambitions and his established musical identity. As a result, the drum loops and computer-altered electronic sounds and other modern touches that they’ve brought to the table fit comfortably in settings that have over the years become Sir Paul’s trademarks: the jauntily psychedelic faux-classical jingle, the pastoral landscape story-song, the occasional acerbic ripper that he uses to remind us that he’s not all tea and crumpets and quaintly eccentric British aristocrats.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A lot has been made about how busy McCartney’s been keeping himself well past retirement age, and much should be: it’s gratifying and inspiring to see the pop musician who arguably most deserves to rest on his laurels steadfastly refuse to do so. But even more remarkable than his work ethic is the fact that he’s still trying to improve himself as an artist. While the songs on <i>New</i> don’t have the historical import or epic ambition of his best-known work, they also don’t have the same kind of flaws. He’s far less sentimental than he used to be, far less prone to letting his whimsical side carry a song off to cloud cuckoo land, and a much, much better self-editor than he was during the peak of his career. His fellow Boomer musicians could learn a lot from him. As a matter of fact, a lot of the ones from subsequent generations could, too.</span></p></div>"|18634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18634-paul-mccartney-new/|7.8|Miles Raymer

To date, they've offered a couple of LPs and one EP of psych-meets-punk songs that feature Jonny Bell barking and wailing all the while. Certain tags may suit one or two of their tracks—a byzantine auxiliary-percussion psych jam here, a weirdo post-punk freak-out there—but going into their third LP, the only two words that really do them justice are “rock” and “loud.” They’ve jammed econo, taking a vegetable-oil-powered bus on tour and selling copies of their<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11580-ep/"" target=""_blank""> first EP</a> on CDRs packaged in recycled brown paper bags. They’ve nabbed opening spots for Cold War Kids and Gogol Bordello. They’re a mix between a DIY band that might get a wink and a nod from Gregg Ginn and that guy who'll argue <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWR1h-5EzUo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Rat”</a> is the best thing the Walkmen have ever done.</p>
<p>On <i>Nothing Is Real</i>, the band continue to elude easy classification. That could be due in part to their constant label hopping, which now finds them rubbing elbows with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27935-nosaj-thing/"" target=""_blank"">Nosaj Thing</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/"" target=""_blank"">Rhye</a>, and the Allah-Las on the boutique LA-based <a href=""http://www.innovativeleisure.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Innovative Leisure</a>. With each new record (and label), Crystal Antlers jettison what they feel like isn’t working. Now, there’s very little acid-informed psych and none of the proggy-bongo jams. In fact, they’ve let their bongo player go, scaling the band down to a trio with singer/bassist Bell, drummer Kevin Stuart, and guitarist Andrew King. <i>Nothing Is Real</i> is more an album of skeletal prototypes for big-venue rock songs, huge ambitions with shoe-string budget sound.</p>
<p>Many of the moments here come off like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies"">Pixies</a> without the brevity. A neat feeling, really, because if you ever wished “Something Against Me” was twice as long, you could put on “Better Things” and be in heaven. It starts with a blown-out drum track and mosh-pit energy, crammed with fist-pumps and I’m-over-you vibes, Bell hollering that he’s got better things to do. He’s still a great singer who sounds like he eats a steady diet of glass shards. It helps him lead the band in a way many young punks ignore—a dynamic vocalist who wants a textured sound to balance the lead guitars and drums. Just listen to him yawp the chorus to the mid-tempo chug rocker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15759-rattlesnake/"">“Rattlesnake”</a>. Black Francis would be proud.</p>
<p>“Rattlesnake” is one of a few songs here with a radio-rock template that's practically waiting for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Vig"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Butch Vig</span></a> to get a hold of it. The other big one is “Persephone”, an overgrown garage-rock track with stadium ambitions, big guitar solos, and vocals from Bell that sound like he's tearing a hole from his throat to his heart. He spent time recording <i>Nothing Is Real</i> in his own studio, which he said allowed the band to stretch out and allow more pop ideas to enter. When they move into less angular, less organ-backed acid-jam territory, they distance themselves from dozens of faceless California psych rock bands and start overlapping with something bigger. Melodic, top-shelf indie rock acts like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4626-the-wren"" target=""_blank"">Wrens</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade</a> aren’t too far away from where Crystal Antlers are orbiting—at this point, they could open for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2353-kings-of-leon"" target=""_blank"">Kings of Leon</a> and you might only bat one eye at it.</p>
<p>Bell throws the machine into first for a few songs to give the album a nice shape, even if it's already one or two tracks over the line. There’s a return to their lonely desert-psych vibes (“Don’t Think of the Stone”) and a broken Dinosaur Jr. power ballad (“Prisoner Song”) that closes things out with Bell screaming, “Lost my legs and my will to live."" Even though it's a throw back to the same melody and lyrics as previously heard on “Rattlesnake”, it's one of many examples of Bell’s splotchy emotionalism that raises the question, what if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Morrissey</a> got really into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8999-rites-of-spring"" target=""_blank"">Rites of Spring</a>? He doesn't really offer sharp, pointed lyricism, but he does give the album a haze of depression capped by a few moments of catharsis. It’s a great sound for Crystal Antlers, but the band is still pivoting in place, eyeing possible directions without committing fully to any of them. Which, in turn, makes it hard to commit to the melodramas and broad strokes on <i>Nothing Is Real</i>. Is spiny, unfettered arena rock the groove for Crystal Antlers? It's certainly as loud and rocks as hard as anything they've done before, but we’ll see if they kick it to the curb on the next one.</p></div>"|18646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18646-crystal-antlers-nothing-is-real/|7.1|Jeremy D.

These are things most young bands strive for, but in the case of Summer Camp, that last part is especially important. Latching onto the  filter-friendly lo-fi trends that defined much of 2010 for their breakthrough EP <i>Young</i>, Warmsley and Sankey polished up their sound the following year with their varied but ultimately flat debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16069-welcome-to-condale/"" target=""_blank""><i>Welcome to Condale</i></a>, a quasi-concept album that concerned itself with young love in a fictional California town. Though not without its charms, <i>Condale</i> suggested the two were already pushing the limits of their twee sensibilities. It seemed smart then that between LPs they went full-on Dance Camp with the <i>Always</i> EP, a disco-dazed detour that suggested something of a revitalization. And while <i>Summer Camp</i> is no doubt an extenuation of <i>Always</i>, it's also proof that risk and reinvention are still of little interest to the couple.</p>
<p>Despite Warmsley's initial characterization of his new record, Summer Camp haven't necessarily abandoned their former selves. For a band that's recorded songs with titles like ""1988"" and ""Veronica Sawyer"", it's obvious old habits are bound to die hard. Though they certainly aren't quite as hung up on retro pop culture as they used to be, their reliance on generic pop looks tends to win out over all else. And yet, at the outset of <i>Summer Camp</i>, the band's inborn nostalgia-mining is still on display, looking well-intentioned and potentially fruitful as usual, if not a little shaky. Ignoring the drawn-out, sci-fi b-movie soundtrack opener ""The End"", the following pair of songs—the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/630-blondie/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Blondie</a>-ish first single <a href=""http://www.gorillavsbear.net/2013/07/17/premiere-summer-camp-fresh/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fresh""</a> and the beat-smart shimmer pop number ""Crazy""—suggest that there's something redeeming to be found in their Lisa Frank-patterned cheerfulness. ""Fresh"" boasts some wonderfully noodly bass licks, while ""Crazy"" (the best thing here by a mile) shares a welcome common irreverence with something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12544-dont-move/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Phantogram's ""Don't Move""</a>. Still, the songs' shortcomings (Sankey's unappealingly Broadway-esque vocals on ""Fresh"", for example) reveal more about <i>Summer Camp</i> than their strengths. Despite a basic low-stakes appeal, the general lack of personality and, more crucially, distinctive hooks is what ultimately makes the album a long, forgettable experience.</p>
<p>It would be generous to say that the rest of the material feels like it was meant to accompany one long Payless ad (see the diabetic ""Keep Falling"", or ""Pink Summer"", or pretty much anything else already discussed), but that would be to ignore some of the truly noteworthy clunkers. There's ""Two Chords"", a shameless ripoff of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2V_ZT-nyOs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All My Friends""</a> that goes on for six minutes but feels at least twice as long (""Waiting, waiting, waiting for the next thing,"" Sankey sings tellingly). And ""Fighters"", an achingly corny ballad about a couple who once took on the world together, but now have turned against one another. And least appealing of all, ""Everything Has Changed""—and what the hell, ""Phone Call"", too—both of which even Shazam would have a hard time distinguishing from third-rate Natasha Bedingfield songs. Perhaps the most damaging thing about these tracks is that they cloud the merely shrug-worthy moments, dashing what could have been, even at best, an inoffensive piece of work.</p>
<p>While it's admirable that, despite a prevailing fondness for suburban teen pop that predates the cordless phone, Summer Camp are trying their best to kick their reliance on nostalgia, they've rendered themselves rudderless in the process. Such a slavish focus on the past can be a problematic handicap, but at least there are familiar pleasures that can be derived from recognizable touchstones. With<i> Summer Camp</i>, Warmsley and Sankey feel stuck somewhere between then and now, a safe place where they can lean on a trusted crutch when necessary and, less advisably, try on a few new looks without upsetting the natural balance of things. But in playing it this safe, <i>Summer Camp</i> is just another entry in an increasingly trivial catalog.</p></div>"|18469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18469-summer-camp-summer-camp/|4.8|Zach Kelly

The record, like its predecessors, was a tremendous tangle of possibilities. The tender coos of folk songs abutted generous passages of abstruse misdirection, putting Stars Like Fleas not among the moment’s freak-folk horde but in a more rarified and truly exploratory realm. <i>The Ken Burns Effect</i> demanded a next step, new music that took any number of Stars Like Fleas’ dozens of implied influences in more definitive directions. “I’m pretty good at making myself uncomfortable,” <a href=""http://www.papermag.com/2006/10/the_stars_like_fleas_effect.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fields had said in an interview</a> while the record was being made, “and am always trying to make the people around me uncomfortable.” Yet you wanted Stars Like Fleas to get a little bit comfortable, to settle in and let the inchoate nature of its music solidify just a tad.  </p>
<p>But that never happened. Stars Like Fleas imploded just before finishing its next album, and its components have since scattered in enough directions to give new credence to the band name. Fields headed north to a small farm near Cooperstown, N.Y., to take a break from New York City and to try and build something of his own. After two years of digital EPs, singles, covers and compilation contributions, Fields has finally emerged with the self-titled debut LP <i>Leverage Models</i>, a solo endeavor fortified by a dozen friends and a dance record that might pad some expectations of that phrase. Though Stars Like Fleas never had its chance to settle, Fields did. The result is a propulsive but ponderous 10-track wonder that hits all of the pleasure centers—that is, you <i>will</i> dance and sing—while offering a supple-enough sound to become something of a headphone symphony, not unlike the more recent works of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Dear</a>. <i>Leverage Models</i>, then, makes a mostly clean break with Fields’ past but, yet again, extends an enticing arrow toward his future.</p>
<p>These concise and swift songs key on heaps of synthesizers, electronic drums and manipulated vocals woven into crisscrossing patterns. Consider his breathless lead vocals during the anxious “Night Falls on the General Assembly” or his italicized verses during lead single “Cooperative Extensions”: Fields is clearly the star here. But <i>Leverage Models</i> is more generous than a solo production made in the bedroom of an isolated farmhouse. Slap-bass bubbles from the cracks beneath verses and choruses of that first track. A saxophone squiggles out of the bridge during “The Chance to Go.” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"" target=""_blank"">Sharon Van Etten</a> provides the unleavened, plaintive voice onto the tragic hero for “Sweep"". Indeed, though this is Fields’ project and his harbor, the massed-ensemble approach of Stars Like Fleas remains; more than a dozen musicians contributed to <i>Leverage Models</i>, from Mr. Bungle bassist Trevor Dunn to classical violinist Jim Altieri.</p>
<p>Such an esteemed cast gives Fields a wide sonic palette, allowing him to fill these instant hits with all manner of layers and textures and twists. The irrepressible “Hunting Safety"", for instance, swells and stops and starts again, shifting from nervy arpeggios and skittering rhythms to a wide-open, full-throated sing-along. It eventually grinds into the same noisy futuristic funk that shapes the best parts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs/"" target=""_blank"">Gayngs</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14188-relayted/"" target=""_blank""><i>Relayted</i></a>, an album that shares stylistic precedents with this one. In less than four minutes, “Out in the Open (Propositional Representations)” changes countenances a half-dozen times; one section that recalls the sprawl of Neu! abuts a span of seductive Prince-like winks. You could spend a month mapping the parts written into these three-minute tunes and still find something new on the next listen, such as the piano that traces the melody 90 seconds into “Cooperative Extensions” like a set of phantom steel drums. This is vivid and immediate music, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be intricate.</p>
<p>Though <i>Leverage Models </i>borrows the old band’s personnel approach in execution, the record’s development seems to have sat mostly with Fields. These songs seem too focused to be formed by committee, too swift and steady to be anything but bursts of ideas later repaved by a bigger band. “Night Falls on the General Assembly” is all momentum and memory, while the lifting keyboard chords and sleigh-bell jangle of “The Least of Your Brothers” is a product of pure pop concentration. Stars Like Fleas’ music was rife with references and influences, and so are these tracks. From <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3151-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark/"" target=""_blank"">Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"" target=""_blank"">David Byrne</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3075-gary-numan/"" target=""_blank"">Gary Numan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2435-bill-laswell/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Laswell</a>, you can hear the giants of Fields’ record collection, hopefully nodding along to his own beats. You can hear the influence of his peers and friends, too, labelmates and tourmates such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5531-bear-in-heaven/"" target=""_blank"">Bear in Heaven</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28016-helado-negro/"" target=""_blank"">Helado Negro</a>. But Fields <i>starts </i>from these touchstones now and moves forward rather than simply folding them into his own music. That new intimacy radiates in Fields’ lyrics, too. Careful reflections on private pain, from domestic abuse and political apathy, his words reflect much the same arrival as this music, even if they do so in grays and blacks that run counter to these neon synthesizers.</p>
<p>During the last few years, Fields has participated in a number of experimental ensembles. To some extent, Stars Like Fleas was one, but he’s also played in <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/a-crimson-grail"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rhys Chatham’s massed guitar pieces</a> and with Duane Pitre, <a href=""http://www.duanepitre.com/feelfree/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a composer whose remarkably approachable work hinges on just intonation and computer-generated chance</a>. You won’t necessarily leave equal temperament or notice aleatoric sound design during <i>Leverage Models</i>. But if you listen to these songs again and again, you will hear a systemically restless musician returning to the core he loves. But he does it the favor of fucking it up, of reworking every rubbery groove and feathery melody until they become something that’s at once familiar and foreign. </p></div>"|18604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18604-leverage-models-leverage-models/|8.2|Grayson Currin

This was 2001: Ambient and electronic music was still ruled by the penetrating austerity of labels like Mille Plateaux and Raster-Noton—labels whose artists strove to make their music sound as digital as possible. Markus Popp's Oval, which inspired a lot of supposedly funny comments about whether or not its CDs were skipping, is still probably the best example of this—and in an era where CDs are starting to go the way of the public pay phone, probably the most quaint, too.</p>
<p>From its title down, <i>Haunt Me</i> presented a model of electronic music that was spectral, imperfect, and capable of erosion. The most applicable metaphors for it weren’t technological, but natural: Parts of the album sounded like the slow tearing of paper, other parts like wind blowing across infinities of sand. Hecker didn’t just imbue his computers with “warmth”—a lazy term that has long needed to be put down—but with mortality. (Remember that that this was 2001, a year after the Y2K scare made supposedly infallible stores of digital information look vulnerable in a very human way.) At the time, <i>Haunt Me</i>’s most obvious companion was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"" target=""_blank"">Fennesz</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9760-endless-summer/""><i>Endless Summer</i></a>, a grainy, blissful album that resembles easy-listening music coming through on the broken broadcast of a distant star.</p>
<p>Hecker has more or less followed course for the past 12 years, releasing high-quality albums with the low-key consistency of someone apparently unconcerned with trend. His approach to sound and texture can be traced to mid-2000s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>, the ominous holding patterns of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> (fellow Canadians with which Hecker has toured), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"" target=""_blank"">William Basinski</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17064-the-disintegration-loops/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Disintegration Loops</i></a>, and basically any music that sounds like it has been abandoned by its maker to rot. His peaks are arguable: My favorites are 2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9497-harmony-in-ultraviolet/"" target=""_blank""><i>Harmony in Ultraviolet</i></a> (his most conventionally beautiful) and 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15124-ravedeath-1972/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ravedeath, 1972</i></a>, which was built out of a single session of live organ, piano and guitar, recorded in an Icelandic church, and later worked over in the studio.</p>
<p><i>Virgins</i> is the first Tim Hecker album more focused on performance than process. Most of it was recorded with a small group of orchestral musicians affiliated with <a href=""http://bedroomcommunity.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bedroom Community</a>, the collective that also includes composers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"">Nico Muhly</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5924-ben-frost/"">Ben Frost</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8718-valgeir-sigursson/""><span>Valgeir</span><span> Sigurðsson</span></a><b> </b>and Paul Corley. (Frost helped record <i>Ravedeath</i>; Paul Corley engineered both <i>Ravedeath </i>and <i>Virgins</i>, and co-produced Oneohtrix Point Never’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18537-oneohtrix-point-never-r-plus-seven/""><i>R Plus Seven</i></a> at Bedroom Community’s Greenhouse Studios in Reykjavik; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>’s Dan Lopatin collaborated with Hecker on 2011’s <i>Instrumental Tourist</i>: The world of forward-thinking electro-acoustic music is a small and fraternal one.)</p>
<p>The live-room conceit is an interesting turn for an artist who for a long time worked in a primarily digital realm: Rather than having the music conjure a space, the space now shapes the music—a return to idea of sound as something that exists in the air before on hard drives, and of albums as specific records of specific people in specific places. Even the electronics—and there are still plenty of electronics—sound like they’re refracting and ricocheting off of wood and metal, scraping a ceiling, trying to find a way out.</p>
<p>Hecker’s music has always been eerie, but never this forceful. Some sections of <i>Virgins</i> feel like soundtracks for horror-movie climaxes when the camera fixes on a sickening image and refuses to turn away, fascinated and trapped at the same time. Even the album’s quieter moments are more tense than they might’ve been on Hecker’s earlier albums—a function, maybe, of a live-room environment where every creak and whisper seems to be happening a few feet from the speakers instead of at some artificially cavernous distance.</p>
<p>This is music that benefits from being heard loud and/or on headphones in the same way couches are best experienced by actually sitting down in them instead of just brushing your fingers against the upholstery as you leave the room. Like a lot of Ben Frost’s albums (or something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/""><i>The Seer</i></a>), <i>Virgins</i> feels possessed by the idea that no advancements in society or technology will ever shake our primal reactions to fear, wonder, awe and what in a more naïve era used to be called the sublime. And while it’s a fallacy to think that hyperseriousness is the only way to strike people at their core, it’s still inspiring to hear an artist—especially one who started out as mellow as Hecker—double down and make a statement so confrontational. Once haunted, now he’s the one who haunts. </p></div>"|18559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18559-tim-hecker-virgins/|8.3|Mike Powell

In the interim, we’ve seen reissues of their two best albums (1993’s <i>Vs.</i> and 1994’s <i>Vitalogy</i>), three live collections, a slew of side-project activity, and a 20th-anniversary world tour capped by the release of Cameron Crowe’s documentary <i>Pearl Jam Twenty</i>. As that film illustrated, this band has much to be proud of, having survived sudden success and the attendant media scrutiny, a risky (at the time) rejection of MTV, grueling court battles with Ticketmaster over fair practices, fan backlash over the band’s more politicized gestures, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roskilde_Festival#2000_accident"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">horrible tragedies</a>, and the overall collapse of the music industry with their arena-filling acumen intact.</p>
<p>And yet, even an exhaustive documentary produced by a super-fan like Crowe doesn’t have much to say about the band’s post-millennial output—because there’s really not a lot to say. Pearl Jam ceased long ago to be a band that makes records with any sense of occasion to them: no intriguing backstory, no conceptual constructs to shape the album’s identity, no new contemporary influences that might push them in an unexpected direction. You just get another nine to 13 Pearl Jam songs that—as per the quiet/loud division of 2004 anthology <i>Rearviewmirror—</i>can be easily slotted into one of two categories. (Even the tracklist sequences are invariably similar: the second song will be a no-fuss rocker that serves as the single, and the album will inevitably close with a wistfully earnest ballad.) Pearl Jam are arguably the only modern rock band of note that consciously moved away from its formative, hit-making sound—in the period spanning <i>Vitalogy</i> through to 2000’s <i>Binaural—</i>but came out the other side an even more traditional, predictable band. </p>
<p>So if you’ve been paying any attention to Pearl Jam’s activities over the past decade, you already know what to expect from <i>Lightning Bolt</i> (and it’s certainly not a tribute to <a href=""http://laserbeast.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Rhode Island avant-metal duo of the same name</a>; heck, even the Pink Floyd comparisons <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/pearl-jam/72377"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bandied about in pre-release interviews</a> seem offbase, unless your conception of Pink Floyd begins and ends with “Mother”). Like 2009’s <i>Backspacer</i> before it (and 2006’s <i>Pearl Jam</i> before it, and 2002’s <i>Riot Act</i> before it), <i>Lightning Bolt</i> begins with a spirited sprint before sputtering out and winding up in dullsville. The feeling of déjà vu is compounded by the strip-mined subject matter, as Eddie Vedder explores familiar themes of family strife and domestic unrest while once again celebrating the therapeutic powers of surfing and listening to music on vinyl.</p>
<p>If Pearl Jam can no longer recapture the sort of hot-wired intensity that once had Vedder stage-diving off festival scaffolding, they can at least still raise an inspired ruckus when the mood strikes: “Mind Your Manners”—a.k.a. “Spin the Black Circle Some More”—reformulates the original grunge cocktail recipe of mid-1970s hard rock and early 80s hardcore, with a chooglin’ intro reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9LWFnUtlEQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early KISS deep cut “Parasite”</a> that gets mowed down by a boot-stomping blitzkrieg, which in turn is blindsided by a sublimely melodic middle-eight. And “My Father’s Son” is the rare latter-day Pearl Jam rave-up to put the spotlight on bassist Jeff Ament, whose sense of groove—once the cornerstone of the band’s sound—has been deemphasized by band’s ever-growing propensity for straight-ahead, chug-a-lug rockers.</p>
<p>Despite their punk-schooled principles, Pearl Jam have never been shy about their debt to classic rock, but it’s usually good classic rock: The Who, Crazy Horse, the Stones. And while the upward-arced anthemery of the title track and “Swallowed Whole” continue to dutifully honor this holy trinity, <i>Lightning Bolt</i> also betrays the long-term diluting effects of spending too much time hanging on the right of the dial. “Let the Records Play” is boilerplate, bad-to-the-bone blooze, while the album’s centerpiece ballads tread on odious Lite-FM territory and forcefully tip the scales from poignant to maudlin, whether it’s the Goo Goo Dolls sheen of “Sirens” or the Hornsby-esque piano rolls of the closing “Future Days” (definitely <i>not</i> a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXX5-p6sUwI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Can cover</a>) that made the song a natural fit for the closing sequence of last week’s ""Grey’s Anatomy"". (By contrast, the countrified lament “Sleeping By Myself” benefits from a lighter touch, thanks to a gleaming George Harrison-style guitar refrain that draws the cheekiness out of the song’s woe-is-me sentiments.) The Pearl Jam mythos as it exists today is undeniably wrapped up in their notoriously epic live shows, wherein the band is famous for loosening up and stretching out, but for whatever reason, that adventurous ethos rarely translates to their increasingly mannered albums.

Over three years, Hoax have remained firmly underground on principle, playing remote locations <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-WT078cAIE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like a cave</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu62LH0Sfa4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a now-legendary recycling plant gig</a>. Jesse Sanes, the perpetually-fuming 27-year-old singer, habitually bleeds from the head on stage and gets crowds of primarily young men to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn6xIUcX63U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shout</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=866UK1AWXaM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lines</a> like ""I'M A FAGGOT"" (I have interpreted <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0TpaqQ59U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this song</a>, from their debut 7"", as an indictment of homophobic bullying). There has been nearly as much discrediting punk-world chatter about Hoax and their supposed ""hype"" as tracks from the band—its previous output has spanned just over a dozen songs with such titles as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRagIBKflCM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Discipline""</a> and<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlKIyNhgpxU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> ""Living on the Brink of Suicide""</a>. This <a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/download/inbe7t3epqxxbei/HOAX+LP.zip"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">debut full-length</a> transcends the noise.</p>
<p>Sanes typically sounds as though he's about to implode, with tough, raw growls that cover the most morbid shit. Self-deprecation doesn't quite hit it; with his bleak lyrics comes the evocation of guilt for just existing. Hoax's brooding sound is steeped in mutant destruction and caustic anger—a mid-tempo hardcore foundation with thick, chainshaw guitars and gruff grunts, pummeling towards metal. You could see fans of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17784-nails-abandon-all-life/"" target=""_blank"">recent brutal Nails record</a> liking Hoax as much as followers of more accessible strains of dark punk; the band is self-loathing but not self-sabotaging. Placing headphones blaring <i>Hoax</i> into your eardrums has the empowering effect of plugging a phone charger into an outlet; you’re struck with a visceral surge of energy that is possibly dangerous. Play <i>Hoax</i> while walking down the hall at school, and no one is going to fuck with you.</p>
<p>""Drive"", the record's peak, has one of the most tense breakdowns you'll find anywhere (complete with an endearing prefacing chant of ""BREAK-DOWN!""). There is crank, build, and release—momentum made of a militaristic drum march and slow, searing, sinister guitar solos. The record's ""Intro"", from New York noise artist Margaret Chardiet aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31210-pharmakon/"" target=""_blank"">Pharmakon</a>, sculpts vile hacks and nauseting industrial clangs. On <i>Hoax</i>, there is liberation in running to hide from treacherous society; themes of hopelessness, ruinous behavior, and well-served anxieties abound. Sanes searches for answers in the vastness of the sky because he's hateful and hollow inside. He's not fearful of death but makes the incredibly more harrowing assertion of being ""terrified to try at life.""</p>
<p>Sanes' existential missives are so precisely articulated that even without the screaming and scowling they'd still be grating. ""How can I die?/ I'm already dead,"" he roars on the dread-laced ""Anesthetize"", just clear enough to be decipherable. Slow, abrasive, and poetic, the closer ""Los Angeles"" pulverizes both heart and ears; while the band's material is always realistic, this feels especially human and vulnerable, like a twisted lullaby on paper. ""There's a place I go in my sleep,"" Sanes screams, describing dreams of Los Angeles and its potential, he feels, for self-reinvention. With much juxtaposed beauty and grit, the song's real emotional killer—""I can't go on if there's nowhere on earth/ Where heaven is cheap""—conveys an essential dream and dilemma of all artists. </p>
<p>Elsewhere Sanes is directly political, calling out men of power who destroy the planet; ""Fear"" deconstructs the economic concept of ""scarcity"" and blames it on ""whites trapped in fear"" while linking race and poverty to the prison-industrial complex. Political anger <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV52h0XmyCw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fueld earlier Hoax material</a>, all refreshing but unsurprising considering Sanes is also an environmental activist, a position that could offer endless frustration for unadulterated all-caps rage. It seems apt, too, that Hoax's debut 7"" was getting its second pressing around the same time the Occupy movement exploded. A resilient ethos is inherent to any worthy hardcore band, and Hoax defends its complete independence fully, endeavoring to function outside the scope of what they consider corporate leeches.</p>
<p>Nothing about the total misery of <i>Hoax</i> suggests a narrator with a lot of friends, but the album's package makes its 100-strong ""Thank You"" list a central part of its ambitious art concept, along with impressive posters from 14 punk illustrators. The album resists being stripped of its context, meticulously outlining this network of labels and radio DJs and festival-organizers and bands from Brooklyn and Olympia and Barcelona and Copenhagen and Tampa and Toronto and Japan, women and men who helped Hoax be a band on its own terms, gravitating very close to the nucleus of this global community.</p>
<p>As a teenager hardcore changed my life because it ultimately repulsed me—girls were sidelined at shows and it seemed a maddening microcosm for the world in general—but Hoax remind me how I was drawn to it in the first place, how the ideas rearranged the way I thought and gifted me a necessary sense of skepticism. You need this even more in adulthood, and with records like <i>Hoax</i>, one need not travel to spin-kicking pits of testosterone at shows to hear it loud.</p></div>"|18633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18633-hoax-hoax/|8.1|Jenn Pelly

It's a habit employed frequently these days, when setting up and talking up context has become increasingly easier to amplify: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/"">The secluded cabin.</a> The intense personal trauma. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15020-cape-dory/"">The soul-searching sailboat adventure.</a> On one hand, these narratives create a world around the music, painting a lush backdrop. But sometimes the backstory can be deceiving, a crutch that distorts a work's value. Considering how often we impart our own meanings on the music we love, should it matter at all?</p>
<p>In the case of Carey Mercer's <i>Carey's Cold Spring</i>, the latest album from his frenetic, prolific project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1600-frog-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Frog Eyes</a>, it's hard to know how his own heartbreaking preview affects how it's heard. Last month, the Victoria, B.C., native announced the record with a letter explaining that (a) this, unlike many of his previous releases, would not be a concept album; (b) his father recently died and he played the record's final track ""Claxxon's Lament"" for him in hospice as ""the last song that went into his ears,"" subsequently adding the song to the album at the last minute; and (c) no sooner had Mercer finished the record than he was diagnosed with throat cancer, prompting him to self-release the album and postpone touring indefinitely. A few weeks later, the record was dropped <a href=""http://frogeyesmusic.bandcamp.com/album/careys-cold-spring"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on Bandcamp</a>, along with a FAQ. It was an intimate and honest introduction that is now nearly impossible to separate from <i>Cold Spring </i>itself, regardless of how incidental the tragedies might have been to the actual record-making process.</p>
<p>Without those words to contextualize the record, <i>Carey's Cold Spring </i>is probably the most straightforward album Frog Eyes have ever released. Excepting a typically long-winded opener in ""The Road Is Long"", the album's tracks have settled into surprisingly consistent, manageable lengths. Melanie Campbell's idiosyncratic drumming is absent, replaced by more traditional percussion; songs have recognizable bridges, even lines that pass for choruses. The music is still rife with the imagery and thick, twisty metaphors that have endeared Mercer to critics. Themes like the evils of materialism and war power it; women pepper its landscape like wispy, mythological creatures. (Either he has revived one of the supporting characters from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14172-pauls-tomb-a-triumph/""><i>Paul's Tomb: A Triumph</i></a><i> </i>opener ""A Flower in a Glove""<i>, </i>or he knows multiple skittish women named Judith.) ""Don't Give Up Your Dreams"" is the saccharine ballad; its beginning is its most gripping moment, its closer the most important.</p>
<p>But on <i>Cold Spring</i>, Frog Eyes' carefully crafted fever dreams have been replaced by orderly instrumentals and disordered almost-thoughts. Without Frog Eyes' conceptual concentration, it all becomes slack and rambling, its mumbled poetry less crucial to grasp. It's less inventive, less urgent, almost incidental; Mercer's wild-eyed, commanding sermons have softened, and the only true bombast lies in the album's first 60 seconds. It's an awfully quiet album, especially for one ""made over a period of three years"" with a mind on ""riots, occupy, revolutions, storms, floods, melodramatic gestures, leftist factions, mass marches in the streets, the sheer and shocking crookedness of our political and economic system, fear of the right, fear of torture, of murder, of future firing squads, of the consequences of idealism, of the consequences of having no ideals or ideas.""</p>
<p>If you refuse to separate Mercer's life from his art, the record's discontent is eerily weighted by events that came to pass after its recording. On ""The Road Is Long,"" when he sings, ""Evil, I want you to know that I know that you have no plans,"" it feels like a new challenge. And on ""Claxxon's Lament"", the song that now belongs to the late Mr. Mercer, he repeats ""nobody shall die"" and it's crushing; even if he wrote it long before he lost him, the heartbreak is fresh and palpable. In his FAQ, Mercer writes that he is ""supposed to get better,"" and has ""the kind of cancer you fight."" When he returns, <i>Carey's Cold Spring</i>, an album that gazes uncertainly toward an uncertain future, should serve as an appropriate turning point.</p></div>"|18632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18632-frog-eyes-careys-cold-spring/|6.9|Devon Maloney

You need not listen to a sole note by the Portland, Ore., noise-metal transgressors to know as much: The press photos for their 2010 breakthrough, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14512-all-the-waters-of-the-earth-turn-to-blood/"" target=""_blank""><i>All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood</i></a>, depicted drummer Lee Buford and guitarist Chip King poised in a window, rifles and binoculars pointed outside in anticipation of incoming targets. The cover of a recent and masterful EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17970-the-body-master-we-perish/"" target=""_blank""><i>Master, We Perish</i></a>, featured a grimacing skeleton bent backwards atop a pile of stone, what’s left of his frame splitting at the midsection. On albums, they've covered songs about <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Body-Copkiller-Dead-Cops/release/793982"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dead cops</a> and Sinéad O’Connor’s Thatcher-indicting and race-baiting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MR9b9sC3zM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Black Boys on Mopeds”</a>; on the stage, King’s small army of amplifiers and Buford’s cannon-shaped drums become the instrumental equivalent of meat tenderizer. In a recent interview <a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/the-body"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with Tiny Mix Tapes</a>, Buford summarized the Body’s extra-musical antagonism with two swift sentences: “I don’t really like most people in the world, or trust them. The guns are less of a thug or violent thing and more of a separation between us and society.”</p>
<p><i>Christs, Redeemers—</i>the Body’s third record and first for the decidedly non-metal Thrill Jockey­—continues the duo’s tradition of exaggerated malevolence. As with <i>All the Waters</i>, the action opens with the all-female Assembly of Light Choir singing a hymn of solemn despair. This time, though, they’re sucked into a gyre of noise, slivers of static slowly accreting into a sea of volume. Indeed, on the whole, <i>Christs, Redeemers</i> is the most dense, belligerent and focused music that The Body has ever made. In less than three minutes, “Failure to Desire to Communicate” plows through a near-hardcore rumble before downshifting toward hypnotic, hazardous doom; “Shrouded” buries King’s cries in a blanket of static, at least until Buford’s drums overload the entire frame. Where no song on <i>All the Waters </i>lasted for <i>less </i>than four minutes, only half of these get to that point at all. These relatively brief numbers function as black holes, then, sucking up everything the Body has ever done—the horrific samples and suffocating noise, the guitar so low it sound like a bass and the drums so big they sound like artillery blasts, the lyrics about how “the pain of living holds no victory” and the curdling bleat that delivers them—into impenetrable, intimidating cores. <i>Christs, Redeemers</i> finds the Body at the apogee of their brutality.   </p>
<p>Yet the same focus and force that make <i>Christs, Redeemers</i> so heavy are the same attributes that make it less terrifying than its predecessors. In the past, The Body’s uneasiness has depended as much on unpredictability as it has on excessive volume or irate pleas. The Body have thrived on a certain sort of stylistic mania, sonic evidence that the guys holding the guns in those photos might actually be completely insane. During <i>All the Waters</i>, for instance, they played along with a sampled-and-fractured clip of a congregation speaking in tongues, with knee-deep noise and King’s howls battling back with believable animosity; during “Worship”, the closer of this year’s earlier EP, they applied their damaged aesthetic to a 10-minute post-rock mold, building the cacophony into a climax that gave way to a slow-motion comedown.</p>
<p>But <i>Christs, Redeemers </i>feels comfortable and somewhat safe, with song structures that are practically standard and a few techniques repeated often enough to become predictable. The Assembly of Light Choir, for instance, starts to feel like a compositional crutch, with their hall-of-terror harmonies augmenting the despair on half of the record’s tracks in much the same way a coffee-shop guitarist might use a Hammond organ to add gravity to heartsickness. Much the same applies to the album’s ample string sections, their melodrama mostly filling space and time and plainly replicating a feeling that’s already established. All of these tendencies collide for “An Altar or a Grave”, a string-swept doom plod that slinks through a madrigal-choir midsection only to arrive at a coda where King and Buford simply turn up and check out. It’s an obvious string of choices for a band whose sort of audio terrorism has forever hinged on making listeners aghast with surprise—as Buford might put it, on separating their music from others’ society. The most successful statements on <i>Christs, Redeemers</i> balance momentum with instability. “Denial of the Species”, for instance, pushes the hangman guitar, haunting choir, and ghoulish strings beneath a beat that borders on techno. It’s a tease for an onslaught of distortion that never comes, a climax denial buried in a record that typically delivers the promised payload. Once again, it’s the image of the Body projected in sound.</p>
<p>At the very least, this new-found concision and direction might prove useful for the Body in the short-term: This is their Thrill Jockey debut, after all, a chance for them to find freaks within a much broader audience. Why not focus, then, on the most familiar and surefooted side of the band—that hellish, disturbing blitz of doom, noise, and nastiness? Likewise, with the samples and choirs now tucked safely and violently into the kernels of these songs, perhaps they’ll speak more readily to metal audiences, by which they’ve often been overlooked or mislabeled. But the Body haven’t mattered only because they’ve been loud, distorted, and mean, the troika of qualities that <i>Christs, Redeemers </i>spotlights most capably. They’ve mattered because they were able to twist that mess of metallurgh into spaces where it didn’t necessarily belong, into studio experiments with electronics and dynamics and effects that underlined their wrath in unlikely ways. That’s not lost on <i>Christs, Redeemers</i>, but like the terror it once necessitated, it is certainly diminished. </p></div>"|18630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18630-the-body-christs-redeemers/|7.0|Grayson Currin

It also samples a cult leader, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15432-cults/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cults</i></a> drew thematically on various ideas related to its nominal subject: romance as kidnapping, a band as a cult-like escape from the rest of the world's expectations.</p>
<p>Except Cults' songs never sounded like they belonged to a niche audience. Despite a slight lo-fi haze, their bittersweet collage of 1960s girl-group elements, 21st-century production techniques, and direct, inventive songcraft was almost as distinctive on arrival as near-contemporaries<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/"" target=""_blank""> Sleigh Bells</a>' Bubble-Yum blasts. But Cults weren't even abrasive. They could be fuck-you blunt, their spoken-word samples were potentially off-putting, and even their sweetest teen-angel prom dances had devilish undercurrents. But particularly on a song like ""Bumper"", a masterful breakup-scene duet, their potential for converts seemed limitless.</p>
<p><i>Static</i> is more cult-like than <i>Cults</i>. Released after extensive touring, Cults' sophomore album sidesteps presumptions about a rising, major-label band and admirably finds contentment not in what they could be, but what they are right now. And that's moodier, louder, more atmospheric. Multi-instrumentalist Brian Oblivion and singer Madeline Follin again co-produced the album with early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a> engineer Shane Stoneback, but this time they got heavy-hitter help from Ben Allen, the former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1866-gnarls-barkley/"" target=""_blank"">Gnarls Barkley</a> producer whose more recent clients include Animal Collective, Deerhunter, Washed Out, and Youth Lagoon. <i>Static </i>deepens <i>Cults</i>' sound, but the song probably won't spread as far, or as quickly.</p>
<p>Glockenspiel is (mostly) out; 60s and 70s film-score bombast is in, befitting the band members' film-school backgrounds. <i>Shaft</i>-infused orchestral skull-cracker ""High Road"" evokes cinematic James Mercer-Danger Mouse project Broken Bells in more than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWBG1j_flrg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song title</a>; one-minute reverie ""TV Dream"" hurtles after sci-fi theremin. Also in, by the way, is static itself. Recalling the all-silver-everything studios that produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a>'s 2007 masterpiece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10017-sound-of-silver/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sound of Silver</i></a>, Cults have said they'd wheel broken TVs into the room while making the album. A fittingly frazzled guitar shrieks midthrough the galloping, organ-bummed, banjo-folked ""We've Got It"". White noise delicately coats sighing opener ""I Know"" and piano-centered finale ""No Hope"", which tests out a newly Beach House-like duskiness in Follin's vocals, amid gorgeously, brutally depressive lyrics.</p>
<p>""Static"" can also mean staying in one place, of course. With Follin's words buried a bit more in the cacophony, and a relative lack of standout songs compared to the debut's treasure trove, that's also relevant here. First advance track ""I Can Hardly Make You Mine"", with whirring live-band propulsion and a convincing romantic desperation, is by far the poppiest song. Stasis occasionally comes up in the lyrics, too, as on the locket-pocket swayer ""Always Forever"", which sends Follin's voice to unusually pinched heights, or blurrily loping ""Shine a Light"", where all her narrator wants is ""to keep you here forever."" On ""No Hope"", we're told to ""forget tomorrow.""</p>
<p>Cults have studiously avoided revealing what exactly they mean by <i>Static</i>'s title, but they've made clear in interviews their label knows its bread isn't buttered by this little band from the internet. What if static is, in the parlance of our times, business-related interference? ""I Can Hardly Make You Mine"" might be the <i>catchiest</i> song here, but ""So Far"" is the one I keep coming back to like the last album's ""Bumpers"": the way it builds off the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15432-cults/"">debut</a>'s occasional shoegaze squall, the spaghetti-western expansiveness. And, to be perfectly frank, the way it repeats the album's title phrase.</p>
<p>""I wonder how you sleep at night,"" Follin belts on this one, almost echoing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK7CLXHSr1M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Lennon's 1971 Paul McCartney diss</a>—her vocals their most fervent on the whole record—before adding, ""Your static is so far from me."" I like to imagine it's a classic industry kiss-off, a declaration of independence. Can't you almost see the executives listening these demos and frowning, grumbling about ""not hearing another 'Go Outside'""? We'll never really know. Still, last time Cults found freedom in <i>becoming</i> a pop group; on <i>Static</i> they find freedom in remaining stubbornly their <i>own</i> kind of pop group. That might not turn Cults into America's next Top 40 religion, but it should keep their tunefully skewed devotionals well worth revisiting.</p></div>"|18608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18608-cults-static/|6.8|Marc Hogan

Is it a rhetorical question sung by a man whose heart is truly free and is offering advice, or is it sung directly by a man who’s still holding himself captive? These are questions you can trace back to February of 1988, when Wareham entered New Noise Studios in New York with his band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a> and sang the same a verse, and the same chorus twice, all over two chords, and just let the rest of the song spill out after it. The song was <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wlixo0IRlc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Tugboat”</a>, Galaxie 500’s first single, which would come to be one of the most popular entries of Wareham’s entire catalog. It minted what would be the singular sound of Wareham’s career, a prototype for dream pop focused on elegance in simplicity, guitars just before the thaw, and plenty of leg-room. After 25 years, the gravity of his early career is pulling him back.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though it’s certainly not a direct or easy route back. In 2008, Wareham published the memoir <i>Black Postcards: A Rock &amp; Roll Romance</i>. From the corroded flameout with his Galaxie 500 bandmates to the rise and dissolution of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2554-luna/"" target=""_blank"">Luna</a>, from major label fracases to indie label collapses, to broken-down cars, tour vans, planes, busses, marriages. All along, Wareham’s songs reflected a man who alternated between incarceration and emancipation, the conscious and un-, the sober and the two-tabs of ecstasy. In the third act of his career, he peered toward a thing called freedom having gone and made a couple albums with his wife and former Luna bassist Britta as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4555-dean-britta/"" target=""_blank"">Dean &amp; Britta</a>, scoring soundtracks including one for Andy Warhol’s famous screen tests, titled<i> 13 Most Beautiful... Songs for Andy Warhol's Screen Tests)</i>. He even took<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39166-dean-wareham-tours-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank""> Galaxie 500 songs out on the road</a> in 2010.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s a long road to arrive at Wareham’s debut solo record. Born unceremoniously into the world, this brief and stirring mini LP stretches back to his earliest Galaxie 500 days when it was just two verses, two choruses, both the same, and the rest of the song just spills out. Maybe he's channeling one of his heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a> while scoring <i>13 Most Beautiful... </i>or dusting off <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkG6vD2nxk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Blue Thunder”</a> on the road a few years ago, but Wareham is at least glancing in the rear-view, beautifully recapturing that moment in which everything opened up among the gauze and reverb of the magical “Tugboat.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The songs play like a return trip while all the old familiar signposts blur along in the periphery. Galaxie 500 always felt like a swift push out from the dock on into the unknown. On </span><i>Emancipated Hearts, </i><span>Wareham’s journeys feel post-climactic, suspended between the big explosion and the denouement of story about a man who’s still majorly bummed out. It’s heavy, but he's always had a knack for making sense of the existential, like he puts simply on “The Ticking is the Bomb”: “Fallen is the rain/ And the ticking is the bomb.” The song is just two chords above a drum kit played with what could be feathers, a revving guitar idling beneath, stuck between the inevitability of the future and the past.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Wareham’s aim is true due in large part to enlisting Jason Quever, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5127-papercuts"" target=""_blank"">Papercuts</a>, as a producer, himself an acolyte of eclectic slow-core and dream pop in his music. With Quever behind the boards, the electric elysium of Wareham's sound feels grounded, spotted with acoustic guitars and light string arrangements. ""Love Is Colder Than Death"" limps more than it swings, but it’s an earnest admission, layered with his wife Britta playing bass singing harmonies above him. Wareham’s voice has lowered in registers over the years, and here that plays into his role as the bemused seen-it-all. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The song titles are all pulled from obscure literature, poems, and newspapers, which Wareham then builds out from—a writing technique he’s used more than a few times in the past. The title track comes from a 1974 poem by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Betjeman"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sir John Betjeman</a>, the expansive “The Longest Bridge in the World” is taken from a poem by Bertolt Brecht, and “The Deadliest Day Since the Invasion Began” is taken from a book <i>Leaving the Atocha Station</i> by Ben Lerner, about a poet during the Iraqi War who keeps reading that same headline in the paper. Wareham even writes in the notes that he was thinking of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange while working on the title track. His politik hums underneath, but ultimately they become notes in the margin in the larger story. Wareham has a knack for taking the words of others and filtering them through some internal mechanism that makes it all sound like it’s pouring out from his soul.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Which is of course why he's has been so incredible with covers of the years, from Jonathan Richman to New Order to Beat Happening. This EP proper closes with an incredible version of ur-hippy psych-folk group the Incredible String Band’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXtKESEZQLg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Air”</a>, and it’s a fresh breath after much dread, as Wareham hums a chorus, stoned like Lee Hazlewood sipping a daiquiri on a beach. There are two more bonus tracks, a great acoustic coda in “Living Too Close to the Ground” and a clunky digital remix of “Emancipated Hearts”. The former is worth seeking out for its straight-shootin’ simplicity against some of the more oblique themes of the EP, while the latter is not really worth seeking out at all. Even at six tracks, it’s stunning how much life (and death) Wareham spreads over these tracks, and makes these tiny whispers of songs feel like the biggest secret anyone’s ever told you. </p></div>"|18636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18636-dean-wareham-emancipated-hearts-ep/|7.8|Jeremy D.

Not to mention their preferred cultural touchstones are from at least several decades prior—when they say a VHS copy of Uncle Buck has been a tour van favorite, you really believe them. Which is how a shitkicking, raucous indie band shares an album title with a <i>Twilight</i> movie in 2013—it’s likely they just aren’t even aware of its existence. On a much smaller level of ubiquity is “Campfire Songs”—it’s a title associated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13818-campfire-songs/"" target=""_blank""><span>porchfront, improvisatory EP from 2003</span></a>, their last release as a band that was still considered too weird for mass consumption. They might not be aware of that either, but the Men are nothing if not charmingly literal: <i>Campfire Songs </i> is a collection of five songs recorded around a campfire during their Big Indian sessions for <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17668-the-men-new-moon"" target=""_blank"">New Moon </a></i> in Upstate New York.</p>
<p>But the very thing that makes <i>Campfire Songs</i> a logical follow-up also makes it kinda unnecessary. Two of the five songs here are taken from <i>New Moon</i> and they’re amongst the most indicative of how their interests have shifted towards Crazy Horse and classic southern rock more than any of Neil Young’s indie rock descendents. On <i>New Moon</i>, “I Saw Her Face” and “The Seeds” made full use of the Men’s tripartite guitar attack and were played ragged and loud. Yet, removing the drums and swapping out for acoustic guitars does little to change the character of each, particularly in light of the muffled, dank recording of <i>Campfire Songs</i>—this is the Men unplugged, but not <i>Unplugged</i>. Whether or not someone might prefer these versions, they’ll do little to make you think of them differently. The same goes for “Water Babies”,  a solid dirge which simply sounds like the <i>New Moon</i> B-side that it is rather than something that was clearly inspired by <i>Campfire Songs</i>’ holistic format.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to this EP for insight into the Men’s progression as a band, it’s best to think of <i>Campfire Songs</i> as a live performance, or at least chronologically structured. In the last 10 minutes, the Men loosen up and realize that the intended audience for these performances is themselves. And that’s where things get interesting. After a couple of wide angle turns on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16295-open-your-heart/"" target=""_blank"">Open Your Heart</a></i> and <i>New Moon</i>, in a strange way, the final two new tracks on <i>Campfire Songs</i> take the Men back to their origins. “Patience” and “Turn Your Color” are, for a lack of a better word, jam sessions—loosely structured, if structured at all, guided by audible count-offs, filled with stumbled strums, and lasting nearly six minutes each. They’re not entirely <i>au naturel</i>, with tamboura-like drones and backmasked reverb effects being added after the fact. But the combination of the gothic anti-production and detuned acoustic guitars ensure that “Patience” and “Turn Your Color” are as heavy and unpredictable as much of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15629-leave-home/"" target=""_blank"">Leave Home</a></i> even without the abrasion and distortion; previously, the Men made beauty sound like an unintended byproduct of pain, whereas <i>Campfire Songs</i> treats it as a proper artistic goal.</p>
<p>Despite its quick turnaround time, the Men actually are allowing listeners to catch up on <i>Campfire Songs</i>. Typically, the Men’s albums are endpoints and if you catch them live, they’re workshopping the next record and it’ll probably be out within the year. It’s a band whose artistic arc is in hyperdrive—the restorative nature retreat usually happens once an artist bottoms out at least a decade into their career. On the contrary, to <i>paraphrase</i> New Moon’s “Half Angel Half Light”, the Men are a rock band on a roll, but as with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods"">Woods</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall"">Ty Segall</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, prolific and consistent bands run the risk of being taken for granted after making the inevitable leap from lo-fi. It’s not an essential release in the Men’s rapidly growing discography, but as a rare snapshot of a band constantly in motion, <i>Campfire Songs </i>is sensible at least.</p></div>"|18609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18609-the-men-campfire-songs-ep/|6.5|Ian Cohen

They don't leave much room for interpretation: Fela's regal, commanding presence was a lot of what he was selling, and to mess with the watchworks of Africa 70 or Egypt 80's arrangements is to risk breaking them. Fela's patois often sounds totally wrong in a voice that doesn't come by it naturally, too—and it doesn't help that a lot of his best songs were well over 10 minutes long.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Red Hot Organization has put together a second tribute album to Fela, who would have turned 75 next week had he not died of AIDS-related complications in 1997. As with the first (2002's <i>Red Hot + Riot</i>), the project's M.O. is to assemble a bunch of American and African musicians in new combinations and see what they come up with; as with that album, it's mostly yielded wild pitches. <i>Red Hot + Fela</i> largely presents itself as a blur of lesser, briefer imitations of Fela's Afrobeat grooves, liberally sprinkled with pro forma rapping and vocalists singing lyrics that have lost the political fire they once had.</p>
<p>Aside from Fela's longtime drummer and bandleader Tony Allen, who turns up for an update of his own 1977 track ""Afro-Disco Beat"", the African musicians here (including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29021-spoek-mathambo/"" target=""_blank"">Spoek Mathambo</a>, Congolese rapper Baloji, Beninoise singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9686-angelique-kidjo/"" target=""_blank"">Angélique Kidjo</a>, and the Kenyan group Just a Band) come from outside the Nigerian Afrobeat tradition. That's not a bad idea, even if it's a little ""Africa-is-a-country"": Fela was a pan-Africanist in his way, too. But few of them have much to add to these songs. Just a Band's coffeeshop-friendly ""Who No Know Go Know"" and ""Gentleman"" (which respectively feature deeply unnecessary verses from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30074-childish-gambino/"" target=""_blank"">Childish Gambino</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a>) are particular offenders, scrubbing the excitement out of what were once squawking Africa 70 blowouts.</p>
<p>The same problem applies to some of the lesser-known American contributors. The Austin group Gender Infinity's synth-pop version of ""Highlife Time"", which Fela recorded with his early band Koola Lobitos before his political (and musical) awakening, is a funny idea if you're an Afrobeat nerd, but bloodless in practice. And the L.A. R&amp;B trio King's ""Go Slow"" selectively plucks a few lines from a scathingly funny song about Lagos traffic jams to turn it into a sex jam.</p>
<p><i>Red Hot + Fela</i> occasionally lives up to its possibilities, fortunately. Merrill Garbus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a> has <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBkuTLkHHq4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked about</a> finding Fela's anti-feminist ""Lady"" frustrating, so the hard-kicking arrangement she and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3503-uestlove/"" target=""_blank"">Questlove</a> put together jumps in and wrestles with it, turning the lyrics over to a chorus of women, with the lead vocal taken by the mighty Angélique Kidjo. (Garbus also appears, along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30335-alabama-shakes/"" target=""_blank"">Alabama Shakes</a>' Brittany Howard, on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"" target=""_blank"">My Morning Jacket</a>'s rambling 14-minute ""Trouble Sleep"", possibly the only Fela cover that's ever run <i>longer</i> than the original.)</p>
<p>Another American artist who appears repeatedly here is saxophonist Stuart Bogie of the Brooklyn Afrobeat group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16890-antibalas/"" target=""_blank"">Antibalas</a>, with whom he played in the pit band for the Fela musical on Broadway. Bogie's also worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a> in the past, and that band's Kyp Malone and Tunde Adebimpe join him for a solemn, airy take on ""Sorrow, Tears and Blood"", with its groove pared down to little more than whistling and a pizzicato string riff played by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6375-kronos-quartet/"" target=""_blank"">Kronos Quartet</a>.</p>
<p>Bogie's group Superhuman Happiness contributes two other tracks: an overwrought new wave-funk version of ""No Buredi"", and a take on ""I.T.T."" that features Sahr Ngaujah, who played the title role in <i>Fela!</i> The latter song comes from the days when Kuti and band were, to paraphrase Public Enemy, Nigeria's CNN; its lyrics are an attack on particular politicians and businesspeople of the late 70s, and there's something jarring about hearing Ngaujah singing them in his best Fela impression over a tight, modern arrangement with loud guitar riffs. It's not that Ngaujah and Bogie somehow don't <i>get</i> Fela—few people understand his music better. But what the Afrobeat pioneer added to the pool that contemporary musicians can draw on was his style and sound far more than his songs. </p></div>"|18611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18611-red-hot-fela/|6.1|Douglas Wolk

As he unfurls impulsive runs and quick turns, each move opens a web of new paths he could travel. As a result, when I listen to his albums I end up thinking as much about what could happen as what is happening. But then Orcutt’s plucks and strums are usually so quick and idea-filled, it sometimes feels like everything that could happen actually <i>is </i>happening.</p>
<p>Given this boundless approach to improvised playing, <i>A History of Every One</i>—an album comprised solely of cover versions—is risky. By limiting himself to others’ songs, Orcutt could sound handcuffed, beholden to preset parameters rather than following his muse wherever it wants to take him. Further complicating matters, he’s chosen tunes that are all over 50 years old (some even go back to the 1800s). Many, especially ubiquitous ones like “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas_(song)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Christmas</a>” and “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_You_Wish_upon_a_Star"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">When You Wish Upon a Star</a>”, are so culturally ingrained, any attempt to transform them could be like trying to reshape the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Orcutt views these songs not as patterns to trace but collections of moments that can inspire him toward new ones. That's not really a surprise—he previously used the raw ideas in his head as points from which to launch, so here he takes concepts well-worn by others and does the same. But that doesn’t make it any less of a bold move, because it’s still rare to hear covers that don’t mimic originals or simply replace one style with another.</p>
<p>Orcutt has found another way. He truly explores<i> </i>these songs, eager to hurtle down any tangent that each phrase, hook, or melody could lead to. From a single note he’ll burst into a looped figure or angled run, then dart back to the original figure to find more uncharted avenues to trample. His restless style makes each piece sound three-dimensional, as shards of songs pass each other in a storm of string activity. It makes for exhilarating, sometimes exhausting listening. But it also makes for music that, though it hints at structure, never sounds predictable and rarely settles.</p>
<p>It also makes for pretty varied music considering it’s just one man and six strings—or actually four, assuming Orcutt’s still playing his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/7858-the-out-door-7/2/"">vintage Kay acoustic guitar</a>. A few tracks fly by, like a blistering take on “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zip a Dee Doo Dah</a>” (from the 1946 Disney movie <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038969/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Song of the South</a></i>) and a nearly-epileptic version of the 1915 union anthem “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_Forever"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Solidarity Forever</a>”. But others mix fast runs, sharp stops, and gradual stretches. Orcutt’s rapid-fire sounds are a wonder, but it’s even more impressive when he cuts them with pauses or slows them into moments of reflection. This turns the 1925 song “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_is_the_Loving_Tongue"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spanish is the Loving Tongue</a>” into a kind of serrated elegy, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17413-lightnin-hopkins/"">Lightnin’ Hopkins’</a> “Bring Me My Shotgun” into a seamless mesh of fire and ice. He even turns a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Thousand_Men_of_Harvard"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harvard fight song</a> into a spirited mantra of pointed plucks and urgent moans.</p>
<p>Those moans are stronger than ever on <i>A History of Every One</i>. I’m not sure if Orcutt “sings” (which for him means wordless humming, howling, and wheezing) more than on previous full-lengths, but it sure feels<i> </i>like it. As the album progresses, his voice becomes increasingly prominent, leading the songs rather than reacting to them. By the time he gets to a swaying approximation of “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Davy_Crockett"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ballad of Davy Crockett</a>”, you can almost hear him crooning the melody like he’s teaching it to his guitar. Perhaps Orcutt felt more singing would help capture spirit of these originals, most of which center on lyrics. But just as likely, he needed to deploy all his weapons to find new ideas in songs played so much their potential might already be exhausted.</p>
<p><i>A History of Every One </i>shows that’s far from the case. It also represents a turn in Orcutt’s approach. These songs seem to have inspired a more contemplative mode. It may be paradoxical to call music this active “contemplative,” but even when he’s got the pedal to the floor, you can hear Orcutt thinking these songs through—rolling them over in his mind while pouring them out from his fingers. This culminates in perhaps the simplest thing he’s ever recorded, an album-closing cover of Stephen Foster’s “<a href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Massa's_in_de_Cold_Ground"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Massa’s in the Cold Cold Ground</a>”. Sparse and moving, it shows Orcutt can do as much with restraint as he can with speed—opening up yet another path he can pursue.</p></div>"|18541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18541-bill-orcutt-a-history-of-every-one/|7.8|Marc Masters

The Ferry Gouw-designed cover art for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a>'s latest solo release, the <i>Revolution</i> EP, is tasteless, provocative—and, given pop culture's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7ek5-hcJ9g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current watercooler fixation with twerking</a>, quite timely.</p>
<p>Then again, Wesley Pentz had a leg (or two) up on Miley in culturally co-opting the dance style. The bounce-heavy title track to last year's <i>Express Yourself</i> had an accompanying video that spawned <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJlP4sTtfWE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one of the most NSFW hashtags in recent memory</a>. Ever the canny opportunist, Diplo rode the wave he hath wrought into 2013, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52044-diplo-aims-to-break-twerking-record-this-weekend/"">staging a failed attempt to assemble a record-breaking twerk session</a> (a record that, rightfully, was <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/twerking-world-record-big-freedia_n_3997620.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">finally set by bounce queen Big Freedia in NYC late last month</a>) and putting out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49630-watch-diplos-video-for-butters-theme-featuring-women-shaking-their-asses-and-wearing-balaclavas/"">a video for that EP's ""Butters Theme""</a>, which questionably integrated Pussy Riot-esque balaclavas into his endlessly ass-shaking meme.</p>
<p>On a purely musical level, <i>Express Yourself</i> was a considerable success for Diplo. His try-anything, be-everywhere ubiquity continues to reflect itself in an endlessly growing list of collaborators, and the EP's six songs came with a list of features that rivaled most full-length rap releases in length alone; but in the midst of an especially collab-heavy year for <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/calvin-harris-tops-list-of-worlds-richest-djs-2013-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one of the world's richest DJs</a>, it nonetheless affirmed that Diplo could still deliver shiny, sour-sounding party music when his name's not buried in production credits. On the outset, the similarities between that release and <i>Revolution</i>—six songs (this time, four originals and two remixes), a load of guest appearances, more drops than a container of Visine—suggest a desire to replicate <i>Express Yourself</i>'s mid-level triumphs as exactly as possible.</p>
<p>As Diplo's first solo release in nearly a decade, <i>Express Yourself</i> benefited from a lack of set expectations, and it came out smack dab in one of Diplo and Mad Decent's most commercially fruitful years in recent memory. But that was the past, and <i>Revolution</i> arrives near the tail end of a creatively soft year for Diplo: collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50033-listen-snoop-lion-snoop-dogg-and-drake-collab-on-no-guns-allowed-co-produced-by-diplo/"">Snoop Lion</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49576-listen-to-ushers-go-missin-produced-by-diplo/"">Usher</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52484-listen-sia-the-weeknd-and-diplo-elastic-heart-from-the-hunger-games-catching-fire/"">the Weeknd</a>—as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49788-heres-diplos-remix-of-psys-gangnam-style-featuring-2-chainz-and-tyga/"">a not-exactly-timely ""Gangnam Style"" remix</a>—proved ultimately unmemorable. And then there was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"" target=""_blank"">Major Lazer</a>'s sophomore LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17627-major-lazer-free-the-universe/"" target=""_blank""><i>Free the Universe</i></a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"" target=""_blank""><i></i></a>, which took the pirate-radio giddiness of its predecessor and dulled its edges with collaborative bloat and a genre-hopping lack of cohesiveness that yielded more misses than it did hits.</p>
<p>One of <i>Free the Universe</i>'s few memorable cuts was ""Bubble Butt"", a boneheaded exercise in bass salaciousness that, as the title suggested, found Diplo's attention wavering south yet again. Revolution kicks itself off by completing his gluteal trilogy with ""Biggie Bounce"", a song not dissimilar to its predecessor that features contributions from Jakarta-hailing EDM upstart Angger Dimas, as well as an impossibly douchey verse from Atlanta pop-rap auteurs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29984-travis-porter/"" target=""_blank"">Travis Porter</a>. With a rolling snare sample, hissing-steam percussion, and a deceptively deep low end that pairs nicely with a flatulent horn line, ""Biggie Bounce"" is a fine example of Diplo at his most texturally engaging, particularly when the track doubles into chopped-up vocal samples and gym-teacher whistles halfway through.</p>
<p>Everything on <i>Revolution</i> sounds expensive and well-made, as much a testament to Diplo's resources as it is to his effortlessness in turning out productions that resemble city-crushing gizmos as much as they do future Mad Decent Block Party crowd-pleasers. Specifically, he's perfected the art of the almighty drop, and <i>Revolution</i>'s spring-loaded twists and turns are what stand out the most, from the spacious hiccups that dot the title track's wordless chorus to the bass-siren assault that emerges from ""Crown""'s thick trance-worshipping synths. The EDM explosion in the U.S. marked the first time in Diplo's career that he wasn't at the forefront of a trend in populist American dance music; he's a smart guy, so <a href=""http://digi10ve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/skrillex-a-trak-diplo-billboard-cover.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he's found a way to integrate himself into the conversation cosmetically</a>, but regardless of where you stand on the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM5FddctVU4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bass-face</a> divide, the garishness of Electric Zoo-esque fare is just the latest style that happens to fit Diplo like a glove.</p>
<p>Zooming out from <i>Revolution</i>'s more appealing micro-details, however, reveals the EP's fatal flaw in the form of cohesiveness. What made <i>Express Yourself</i> a considerably distinctive statement was its ability to jump from genre to genre and still manage to hang together as a unified body of work; <i>Revolution</i> sounds less considered and more like a small-scale data dump, a collection of also-rans that makes poor use of its guest stars; the title track's Guetta-fied diva-electro expansiveness, bolstered by faceless vocalist Kai, resembles a worn copy of the low points on ex-Mad Decent affiliate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28713-rusko/"" target=""_blank"">Rusko</a>'s otherwise enjoyable sophomore effort, last year's Songs.</p>
<p>The watered-down boom-bap of ""Rock Steady"" boasts appearances from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29952-mr-muthafuckin-exquire/"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30571-riff-raff/"" target=""_blank"">RiFF RAFF</a>—but the only rapper whose presence sticks is the latter, purely by virtue of being the least mechanically talented of the three. RiFF RAFF's featured on ""Crown"", too, but he's barely distinguishable when cast about the track's synthy fromage and Mike Posner's caterwauling. <i>Revolution</i> is rounded out by uninspiring remixes of its title track and ""Biggie Bounce"" from respective producers Boaz van de Beatz and (fittingly) TWRK; their inclusion furthers the suspicion that this release wasn't too carefully thought out.</p>
<p>Diplo's always been one for having too many cooks in the creative kitchen, both to his advantage and detriment—but what's dismaying about the waste of talent on <i>Revolution</i> is that he would've ostensibly done better working with the people just lingering right under his nose. Mad Decent's 2013 has been considerably strong in terms of curation, with solid releases from talents like Dillon Francis, LIZ, Jahan Lennon, and <a href=""http://maddecent.com/releases/harlem-shake/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a little-heard tune from some guy named Baauer</a>. As mainstream dance's <i>enfant terrible</i>, though, Diplo's never been one to follow anyone's advice but his own, and <i>Revolution</i> is evidence enough that what he <i>can</i> do isn't always going to turn out as well as what he should've done instead.</p></div>"|18607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18607-diplo-revolution-ep/|5.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

After last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16250-paralytic-stalks/"" target=""_blank"">Paralytic Stalks</a>,</i> where <span>his flamboyance came across as ho-hum</span> and even his self-absorption sounded strangely obligatory, Barnes changed up his process for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3139-of-montreal/"" target=""_blank"">Of Montreal</a>’s 12th album. He left Athens, Georgia, and decamped to San Francisco to write. Instead of recording by himself, as he has done on almost every Of Montreal album, he assembled a small band of sympathetic performers. Together, they eschewed computers and lofty conceptualizing, favoring in-the-moment energy over down-the-rabbit-hole perfectionism. Relative to his usual dictatorial working method, it was positively democratic.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially after <i>Stalks</i>, <i>Lousy</i> is bracing. It’s arguably the best—not to mention the funniest, prickliest, most purple, and least fastidious—Of Montreal album since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9796-hissing-fauna-are-you-the-destroyer/"" target=""_blank""><i><span>Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?</span></i></a> Barnes sounds more focused <span>and straightforward</span>, perhaps <span>newly</span> aware that his listeners won’t follow him just <i>anywhere</i>. The songs here boast clearly defined choruses and verses and bridges, even if his digressions within melodies <span>lend</span> the music an intriguing volatility.  If he was channeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank""><span>Prince</span></a> and Faust and the fictional glam-funk avatar Georgie Fruit on previous records, on <i>Lousy with Sylvianbriar</i> his spirit guides seem to be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1131-donovan/"" target=""_blank""><span>Donovan</span></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank""><span>Dylan</span></a>. The album’s softer moments tweak the former’s pastoral folk and <span>spiritually</span> declarative lyrics, and when this iteration of the group cuts loose, they sound like they’re <span>racing down</span> Highway 61 en route to Plato’s Retreat. <span>On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16019-belle-glade-missionaries/"" target=""_blank""><span>“Belle Glade Missionaries”</span></a> Barnes adopts Dylan’s long-winded phrasing, rushed delivery, and heavily coded lyricism, but the performance never descends into impersonation.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Dylan has been an evergreen influence on generations of musicians, but Barnes seems intent on puncturing the <span>Bob</span> mythos a bit, which <span>means</span> <i>Lousy</i> <span>is</span> never lousy with hero worship. Is that album cover a cheeky allusion to Bob’s infamous motorcycle accident, after which he retreated from public scrutiny for a few years? “Hegira Émigré” could be a sly parody of Dylanophilia, suggesting how ill-suited the old forms of protest music are to the post-Occupy world: “My baby’s meditating to stop the war, but I’ve got myself a rifle 'cause I ain't gonna get walked on anymore,” Barnes sings, as the band stomps around like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"" target=""_blank""><span>the Band</span></a> ca. ’66.</span></p>
<p><span>Barnes' songwriting <span>has always thrived</span> on petty feuds and lacerated relationships, stoking low-level, long-simmering interpersonal conflicts <span>for inspiration</span>. At his best, he teases out the tensile connections between humans, giving voice to the darker thoughts and casual prejudices that cloud every mind. </span>Witness “Colossus” : “Your mother hung herself in the National Theater, when she was four months pregnant with your sister,” Barnes sings, setting the scene for someone else’s grim family drama. “Maybe your family, they are just losers.” The statement reads as harsh, but its poignant and commiserative, somehow, heightened by the band’s curiously delicate arrangement. It’s the most empathy Barnes has mustered in ages, even if the sentiment is barbed. </p>
<p><span>Barnes writes in in his own language, a peculiar and personal mix of purple prose poetry, <span>exhausting</span> academic-speak, <span>prescription-medication</span> warnings, and plainspoken pronouncement. <span>So perhaps Dylan is an even more apt model for Barnes than Prince ever was. </span>Like Dylan, he asks you to decode, to dissect, to discuss. Also like Dylan, Barnes seems playfully aware that his lyrics are Gordian knots, impossible for even the most devoted Of Montreal fan (including, possibly, himself) to untangle completely. And yet there are moments of clarity on <i>Lousy with Sylvianbriar</i> that prove Barnes is both his own <span>harshest judge and most lenient jury. Or, as he sings on “Triumph of Disintegration”: “I had to make myself a monster just to feel something ugly enough to be true.”</span></span></p></div>"|18606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18606-of-montreal-lousy-with-sylvanbriar/|7.4|Stephen M.

Tracing the roots of his nation’s music, Taylor notes, “When the British came and colonized this country, there was an invasion also of this Westminster Abbey kind of music, written in the major key, hymns like ‘Oh God Our Help in Ages Past.’ So Ghanaians, naturally, adopted that kind of harmony; it became part of our lives.” Hearing James Brown in the late 60s, Taylor adds, reminded a generation of Ghanaian musicians that lamentation was just as potent as exultation.</p>
<p>That dichotomy of major and minor, happy and sad, haunts <i>Return Flight</i>. Overwhelmingly the tracks are lambent and melancholy, sunsets made sonic. Still, they teem. Swarms of organ notes and stinging guitar licks turn the African Brothers’ “Wope Me A Ka”—one of the most irrepressible tracks on the 13-song collection—into a connect-the-dots funk-puzzle whose final form only begins to coalesce after a shuffling, skeletal break. It’s straight out of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"" target=""_blank"">Fela Kuti</a> fake book, but the Ghanaian artists on <i>Return Flight</i> draw straight from the same source that their iconic Nigerian inspiration did: highlife, born and bred in Ghana. Here, though, highlife’s polyrhythms and jazzy brass cast long shadows. “God is Love” by Complex Soundz may share the gospel luminosity that informs much highlife, but it dangles from a downward-spiralling, almost Santana-like chord pattern that feels more apocalyptic than ecstatic.</p>
<p>Shades of the sacred pop up elsewhere—most blatantly in Los Issufu and His Moslems’ “Kana Soro”—but the chanted prayers bob on choppy waves of organ-jazz, sermons in a bottle. Unlike its excellent predecessor, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14601-afro-beat-airways-west-african-shock-waves-ghana-togo-1972-1978/"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14601-afro-beat-airways-west-african-shock-waves-ghana-togo-1972-1978/"" target=""_blank""><i>Afrobeat Airways: Ghana and Togo 1972-197</i></a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14601-afro-beat-airways-west-african-shock-waves-ghana-togo-1972-1978/""><i>8</i></a>, <i>Return Flight</i> focuses exclusively on Ghana; as such, it’s impossible not to measure it against Miles Cleret’s two volumes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2000-ghana-soundz-afrobeat-funk-fusion-in-70s-ghana/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghana Soundz</i></a>, which helped bring Ghanaian Afrobeat to wider attention. In fact, many of the acts included on <i>Ghana Soundz</i> appear on <i>Return Flight</i>: The African Brothers, Uppers International, Rob, Vis-a-Vis, K. Frimpong, and the relatively ubiquitous Taylor. But <i>Return Flight</i> compiler Samy Ben Redjeb and his Analog Africa team have plumbed even deeper, and they’ve not been found wanting. The late Frimpong—one of Ghana’s most beloved highlife singers—is represented by “Abrabo"", and its bubbling Afropop guitar—not to mention Frimpong’s joyous wail—provides a welcome shaft of sunlight through the rich, murky funk that surrounds it. The most vivid example being Uppers International’s “Aja Wondo"", a fugue of softly psychedelic funk that manufactures its own breathable, if smoky, atmosphere.</p>
<p>Taylor’s remarks in the disc’s liner notes drive home that contrast. However, they also underline the essential slipperiness, the ethereal mutability, of the music featured therein. Rob’s stark, propulsive “Loose Up Yourself” trucks in all the multiple meanings of “loose”—politically liberated, spiritually unbound, sexually free—while refusing to click on a single one, much in the same way its syncopated groove circles and never settles. Taylor’s own contribution to <i>Return Flight </i>is titled “Children Don’t Cry"". Graceful, hypnotically cyclical, and drenched in the kind of dancefloor-coaxed sweat that leaves no tear unwashed, it pulses along in a muted minor-key. At the same time, the band’s intertwined horns uplift—even as they serve as a piercing, aching reminder of everything there is to be uplifted from.</p></div>"|18479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18479-afrobeat-airways-2-return-flight-to-ghana-1974-1983/|8.3|Jason Heller

(""You like Soft Cell <i>and</i> Flipper <i>and</i> Carl Craig? I thought I was the only one!"") Around <a href=""http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/23/1066631556969.html?from=storyrhshttp://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/23/1066631556969.html?from=storyrhs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">10 years ago</a>, Collins started talking about making a bubblegum album with the group; now that they've made their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAI16W7Z0eY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">garage-covers-of-Detroit-techno</a> album and their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvUrCRAe1JU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">garage-covers-of-Sparks single</a> and their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pw6FC8GZZQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">garage-covers-of-INXS single</a>, they've finally gotten around to it.</p>
<p><i>Ooey Gooey Chewy Ka-Blooey!</i>, it turns out, isn't garage covers of bubblegum hits, or even bubblegum obscurities: it's 10 new, original bubblegum songs (rendered, of course, into the Dirtbombs' fuzzed-out two-drummer, two-bassist garage-rock idiom). It's a strange, awkward record, hampered by irreconcilable incompatibilities between its genre and its presentation.</p>
<p>For one thing, bubblegum is a one-song-at-a-time form—it's very hard to take an entire 1910 Fruitgum Company album, say—and, although <i>Ooey Gooey</i> is only half an hour long, it feels like eating dessert for half an hour straight. For another, trying to impose an artistic personality on performing bubblegum is a historical anomaly. The initial wave of bubblegum music was about as far from artist-driven as pop can be. It was the creation of producers and songwriters (the key figures included Jerry Kasenetz, Jeffrey Katz, and Joey Levine, among others), and the singers and musicians were interchangeable to the point that four entirely different lineups of Ohio Express had hit singles between 1967 and 1969. This record, though, is about the band, not the material: Collins' rough, drawling voice is right up front, and despite production flourishes here and there, the Dirtbombs always sound like themselves, wearing Halloween ""sexy bubblegum studio group"" outfits that don't fit them particularly well.</p>
<p>The real failure of <i>Ooey Gooey</i>, though, is that these songs aren't particularly <i>good</i> pastiches. They're formally accurate: dumbed-down riffs, hippie tropes, easy rhymes, references to candy. But stupidity alone doesn't make for wonderful bubblegum. The hits by the Archies and the Lemon Pipers and the Kasenetz-Katz bands were great pop music for five-year-olds, which isn't an insult—five-year-olds have serious bullshit detectors. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOQwdRMTKEk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sugar Sugar""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRtME-3rcP4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Yummy Yummy Yummy""</a> are fine-tuned machines, stripped of everything that doesn't instantly give pleasure, and graced with detailed, constantly shifting arrangements to hold their intended audience's attention. The Dirtbombs' songs here, though, generally have one really good idea apiece: the cowbell tattoo that runs through <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBqDDRDMz1s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sugar on Top""</a>, say, or the innocent/lascivious conceit of <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15966-the-dirtbombs-girl-on-the-carousel/"" target=""_blank"">""Girl on the Carousel""</a>. That's not enough for what they're trying to pull off.</p>
<p>To be fair, it would have been easy for Collins and company to have made <i>Ooey Gooey</i>'s songs smirkier, or to play up the dessert/oral sex metaphors more than they do (only ""Hey! Cookie"" really falls into that trap: ""Ooh, such a groovy scene/ Gonna make sure I lick the plate clean""). There are a handful of very clever gestures scattered across the album, too, especially its closing track ""We Come in the Sunshine"", a homage to 60s song-mills' habit of carbon-copying hits. (Its verses are Collins' approximation of ""Good Vibrations"".) Mostly, though, <i>Ooey Gooey</i> is a proof-of-concept album—yes, the Dirtbombs can Dirtbombify this ordinarily unscuzzy genre, too—rather than one that plays to the band's considerable strengths. </p></div>"|18605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18605-the-dirtbombs-ooey-gooey-chewy-ka-blooey/|5.7|Douglas Wolk

(See, also, the less intersting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31255-ghost-bc/"" target=""_blank"">Ghost B.C.</a>) Metal orthodoxy places reverence of “gods” above innovation, but it's not difficult to see how the quintet are viewed as a tribute to what some still consider King Diamond's finest group. Guitarists Niklas Lindström and Henrik Palm are beholden to the inverted melodicism Hank Shermann and Michael Denner displayed on Mercyful Fate's two most revered albums, 1983's <i>Melissa</i> and 1984's <i>Don't Break The Oath</i>. In Soltiude are heavy metal where, much like the Danes they're compared to, the darkness is alluring and seductive, not esoteric and obtuse.</p>
<p>There is one crucial difference between the two, though: In Solitude's Pelle Åhman is nowhere near as flamboyant, vocally and visually, as King Diamond. Few in metal, or any genre, are—had Freddie Mercury embraced the occult in the 80s, he would have conceivably been a viable rival. Still, the comparisons must have gotten to the band. <i>Sister</i>, their third album, is a marked attempt to stray away from being pegged as “Mercyful Fate worship.” But they haven't watered down their sound, and <i>Sister</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is a mostly successful album. </span></p>
<p>In Solitude are allies of black metallers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5895-watain/"" target=""_blank"">Watain</a>: they've toured the States with them, will do so again soon, and are both looking to broaden their fanbase. Erik Danielsson, Watain's leader and mouthpiece, has praised the band before, saying of <i>Sister</i>, with his own brand of arrogance: “They’re releasing an album later this year that’s going to be… I don’t want to say 'album of the year' because that’s going to be ours....” While Watain's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18305-watain-the-wild-hunt/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Wild Hunt</i></a> was a deliberate attempt to appeal to a wider audience, <i>Sister</i> is better equipped for that task, mainly because In Solitude were already trading in a more accessible sound. “A Buried Sun” has a slight blues edge that's alien in most metal, but quite reminiscent of Danzig. (Looks like covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24850-samhain/"" target=""_blank"">Samhain</a>'s “Mother of Mercy” for Decibel's flexi series last year is paying dividends.) More than any other song on the record, it's a showcase for why Åhman doesn't need to be as over-the-top as Diamond. It soars, but remains close to the earth. Åhman's more about “come hither” than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqcOVzx4CqY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Come to the Sabbath”</a>, mixing in a crooning approach to his singing.</p>
<p>If a Swedish retro-rock group like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27949-graveyard/"" target=""_blank"">Graveyard</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5586-witchcraft/"" target=""_blank"">Witchcraft</a> passed on “Lavender”, it was wise for In Solitude to pick it up. While it's a jaunty romp like anything those groups would do, In Solitude make it sinister and “metal,” complete with an ominous piano ending. Elsewhere, “Pallid Hands” brings a romanticism that hasn't been seen in metal in a while, and is the group's finest song to date. It recalls 70s Judas Priest's more bittersweet moments, a casualty of the group's success in the 80s, or a more serious stab at April Wine's “Sign of the Gypsy Queen”. In Solitude are a young band—Palm is the oldest member at 26—and for them to craft a song filled with weariness and whiskey-afflicted love is a stroke of “Old Man”-like brilliance. You know Lindström and Palm are thinking about <i>someone</i> when playing that intro, it's so natural in their expression. Overall, on <i>Sister</i>, the songwriting feels more influenced by NWOBHM and early 80s speed metal, rather than just Mercyful Fate. In Solitude sound like young men who've been on the hunt for Heavy Load and Oz albums on vinyl, going to every record store within driving distance, and when they've found the gems, they feel so alive.</p>
<p><i>Sister</i> is shorter than its predecessor <i>The World. The Flesh. The Devil</i>, but suffers from the same fate: the disappointing, overlong ending. “Inmost Nigredo” clocks in at just over eight minutes, as opposed to the nearly 14 minutes of “On Burning Paths”, but it still languishes without bombast. This is an unfortunate betrayal of their songwriting prowess, which the album thrives on. Whereas they were able to use a slow burn build-up to their advantage on “Sun”, “Inmost” just drags without focus. They haven't found their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWA1ET0uHDA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Melissa”</a>, their fulfilling send-off. Had they, <i>Sister</i> would be a contender for one of the best metal albums this year.</p></div>"|18518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18518-in-solitude-sister/|7.1|Andy O'Connor

That's one main argument of <i>Delirious New York</i>, a 1978 book by Dutch theorist Rem Koolhaas that Cameron Mesirow has named as an inspiration for her second album as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27809-glasser/"" target=""_blank"">Glasser</a>. It's also a useful frame for understanding the record, not only its specific lyrical concerns but also its general spirit. <i>Interiors</i> is a methodical, computer-tethered expedition into the vast, wild expanse of human feeling.</p>
<p>Glasser's 2010 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14703-ring/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ring</i></a> underpinned Mesirow's soaring vocals with free-flowing, rhythm-obsessed eclecticism that made for a notably welcoming collection of atmospheric, electronics-brushed pop. That description still largely applies to <i>Interiors,</i> but the homespun warmth and tribal rhythms of its predecessor have given way to chilly digital perfection—though plenty of organic elements persist, in a way that's crucial—and the album as a whole is more thematically unified. Mesirow's voice, both a singer and a songwriter, still towers over the proceedings, and you can look to this to orient you anytime the sonic and conceptual edifice grows too dizzying.</p>
<p>Mesirow moved from Los Angeles to downtown Manhattan between albums, and the city she finds here is an Ableton Live-era update on sleek 20th-century modernism: Brancusi's <a href=""http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/486757"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bird in Space""</a>, in CGI space.

<p>Glasser's first widely circulated song, 2009's ""Apply"", meditated on the permeability of walls and windows, and <i>Interiors</i>' rooms, too, are rarely as hermetically sealed as a cursory listen might suggest. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15924-shape/"" target=""_blank"">""Shape""</a>, the opening track and first advance track, introduces the LP's silvery, aerodynamicism with whooshing bass and crisp kick drums, but Mesirow's layered, melismatic vocals are front and center—and she's describing not a city skyline, but an ocean beach. While ""Exposure"" glitchily theorizes on the ""modern trouble"" of urban living, Mesirow is far more likely to use her fabricated sonic setting as a framework for exploring personal demons: The bird calls and tropical tinges on ""Dissect"" signal a lingering stylistic connection to labelmates Tanlines, but next to lyrics about being ""shackled to a window/ Anything but open,"" they also point to her much-reported struggles with spacial anxiety.</p>
<p>The interiors Glasser explores most compellingly are, it won't surprise you at this point to learn, the ones within human beings. She applies the same ruthless precision to these ostensibly messier subjects, so that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52271-video-glasser-design/"" target=""_blank"">video selection ""Design""</a>, an examination of physical desire that wields human breaths as percussion, is crystalline enough for a posh gallery. But the insides of people turn out to be at least as unknowable as those of buildings: ""Keam Theme"", an uptempo standout, opens with a dream sequence and carries on from its oblique title to ask, ""How long before I know you?"" It might just be me, but something about the hook brings to mind Arthur Russell expressing a similarly surreal, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK1mGrsm0yw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slightly different sentiment</a> decades ago: ""That's us, before we got there.""</p>
<p>This is ultimately where Glasser manages to communicate the unknowable—in the way her meticulously arranged soundscapes convey a sense of place even when their literal meaning might be just out of grasp. ""I'm in your landscape, and I don't wanna go back to mine,"" Mesirow intones between rippling synths, sinuous orchestration, and percussive crunches on ""Landscape"", a song that closes with an out-of-nowhere, live-sounding drum-and-keys groove reminiscent of Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder brain trust. It's a track that contains so many of <i>Interiors</i>' paradoxes: the push and pull between 1's and 0's and flesh and blood, between indoors and outdoors (""There's nothing here but walls, walls, walls""), and between two lovers.</p>
<p>Mesirow has also cited Beyoncé as an inspiration, but although a few of the lither moments bring to mind the future-soul of Little Dragon, her closest parallels on <i>Interiors</i> remain big-idea, big-voice art-poppers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"" target=""_blank"">Bat for Lashes</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a>. Indeed, if the album errs in a particular direction, it's in leaning a bit too heavily on abstraction without anything that lowers its barriers quite as far as, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13918-laura/"" target=""_blank"">""Laura""</a>, from Bat for Lashes' 2012 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17174-the-haunted-man/""><i>The Haunted Man</i></a>. A three-part ""Windows"" suite, presented out of order, brings in fractured sax bleats and ambient textures, but it's more difficult to unlock than its title might hint, and overworked lyrics like ""listlessness becomes a habit"" occur a little too often throughout the album. Koolhaas, author of <i>Delirious New York</i>, later decided it was time to <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/03/14/050314fa_fact_zalewski"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""kill the skyscraper.""</a> Glasser has built a dazzling one, but you figure she just might know the feeling.</p></div>"|18602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18602-glasser-interiors/|7.8|Marc Hogan

Thom Yorke and Flea also <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52430-watch-thom-yorke-and-flea-chat-with-jon-stewart-atoms-for-peace-play-the-daily-show/"" target=""_blank"">sat down for an interview</a>, and Jon Stewart posed a common question about side projects: “Within your bands, is there a sense of like, ‘Oh, do you not love us anymore?’” Yorke reported back, “I think it’s all healthy, right? It’s all healthy to free range a bit.” And while Yorke’s current project hews relatively closely to the sonic aims of Radiohead, others depart more sharply from their main gigs. Such is the case with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2057-lee-ranaldo/"" target=""_blank"">Lee Ranaldo</a>’s latest, <i>Last Night on Earth</i>, a meandering, elastic record—and a side effort that will be lost on most <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a> fans.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, Ranaldo <a href=""http://thetalkhouse.com/features/view/lee-ranaldo-the-grateful-deads-long-lost-concert-documentary-sunshine-daydr"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a>—knowledgably and adoringly—about a documentary capturing a 1972 Grateful Dead concert. (He previously tipped his hat to the group’s ultimate live collection from the same year, <i>Europe 72</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/8797-lee-ranaldo/"" target=""_blank"">here on Pitchfork</a>.) And he acknowledges the Dead’s influence on his current experiment with the Dust: “So I was looking at them as a model for some of the exploratory passages that the Dust and I have recently been attempting. Watching the Dead up on the screen was a real lesson in how it’s done.”</p>
<p>The Dust consists of Sonic Youth drummer, Steve Shelley, as well as avant-garde journeymen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2474-alan-licht/"" target=""_blank"">Alan Licht</a> and <a href=""http://luntzel.com/gig.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tim Lüntzel</a>. Together, the quartet has crafted a companion piece to Ranaldo’s record from last year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16413-between-the-times-and-the-tides/"" target=""_blank""><i>Between the Times and the Tides</i></a>. While <i>Last Night on Earth</i> has been billed as more of a cohesive band’s vision, it still suffers from a similar blurry schizophrenia. The Grateful Dead and other psychedelic troupes surely inform <i>Last Night</i>—many tunes clock in at over seven minutes and the closer “Blackt Out”, is just a click under 12—but often Ranaldo calls his past into the fray, forming a conflict. Near the end of the slow burning “Key/Hole”, for instance, he kicks in a raw cacophony and lets the guitar screech. He may not be playing with a screwdriver or attempting to make Michael Gira’s ears bleed, but throughout <i>Night on Earth</i>, Ranaldo takes a step back and realizes that—oh, that’s right—he was in Sonic Youth. And he thrashed. Such coarse epiphanies sound strange in the context of the record’s poppier ambitions.</p>
<p>And he’s moved into unsettled territory in terms of his own forays, to boot. His 1993 collection, <i>Scriptures of the Golden Eternity</i>, boasts track lengths you’d expect from a 1960s acid acolyte but veers toward roughshod 70s clatter. Back then, Ranaldo was knee-deep in stretching out the lab work he began in East Village tenements. Today, an odd blend reigns supreme. Even his jam lines get crossed: The sleek “Lecce, Leaving” recalls Phish’s studio recordings and the jumpy wandering of “Home Chds” Widespread Panic’s. Both songs are hampered by half-baked lyrics and disjointed progressions. “Home Chds” opens with a steady drumbeat that ramps up awkwardly  in the mode of a Gov’t Mule number—Ranaldo aiming squarely for the summer amphitheater lawn section. But couple it with his signature, noisy dissonance on the denouement and the result screams jumbled 1990s: the soundtrack to a melee between fans of the factions. </p>
<p><i>Last Night</i> draws inspiration from the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. “The Rising Tide” is the album’s centerpiece and best example of its apocalyptic tilt; and it’s catchy, too. Ranaldo has a grim outlook on the current state of his environment—the title track is self-explanatory—but the severity and grimness of his outlook are constantly thwarted by a pervasive staleness. <i>Last Night</i>’s disaster themes can even be seen as a more pessimistic counterpart to the Dead’s 1973 album, <i>Wake of the Flood</i>. Unfortunately, Ranaldo’s lyrics don’t have the storytelling deftness that Robert Hunter’s did: On “The Rising Tide”, Ranaldo sings, “In this pure moment let all best intentions expire/ ‘Light up,’ you said, ‘Light up so we can all feel our desires.’” Ranaldo has rightly asserted that jam bands like the Dead have been on the cutting edge of experimentation, as has Sonic Youth. Still, even if the theoretical dots between the two sides’ progressive elements connect, Ranaldo can’t make it jibe here. </p>
<p>There’s no edict that demands a musician, branching out for a solo effort, mimic the sound of his or her steady paycheck source. (Or even to earlier solo material.) Why would an artist, as Yorke alludes, make a solo record if not to branch out? But stumbles like the befuddling Baroque harpsichord of “Late Descent #2” or the lay-up rhymes of “By the Window” prove how difficult deviations can be. The evolving identities of Lee Ranaldo might be a valiant pursuit, but they have made for a problematic tone on <i>Last Night on Earth</i>.</p></div>"|18599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18599-lee-ranaldo-and-the-dust-last-night-on-earth/|5.5|Colin St. John

But there are ideas that come close, and one of them is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 73</a> founder Guillermo Scott Herren working with the artists his music influenced. That holds true whether the musicians cutting tracks for labels like Brainfeeder or Friends of Friends owe a specific debt to those early Prefuse 73 albums, or if they just connect to them as another piece of a larger precedent. L.A. producer Mtendere Mandowa-- b/k/a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29245-teebs/"" target=""_blank"">Teebs</a>-- fits comfortably under that crowded tent. With impressionistic washes of sound like the cuts on <i>Collections 01</i> and his breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14798-ardour/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ardour</i></a>, Teebs' aesthetic makes him a natural first choice for Herren's newest collaborative series, <i>Speak Soon</i>, as <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/31693-sons-of-the-morning/"" target=""_blank"">Sons of the Morning</a>.</p>
<p>Splitting the difference between the two artists means <i>Vol. 1</i> comes across like a seamless mobius strip of mutual refinements on minimalist ambient hip-hop. And it pans out pleasantly enough over the course of a seven-track, 28-minute EP. Not much gets compromised in the collaboration: both artists' senses of organically tactile ambience and brittle, split-apart melody complement each other well. Laying out basslines and rhythms like elements in a field recording seems as easy as small talk for a couple of mad-scientist musicians like Herren and Mandowa. Their respective senses of musical spaciousness and fidelity-warping mood setting should've resulted in something with restless pull and positive tension, but instead there's the nagging undercurrent that comes with a lot of one-off teamups—the music rarely rises above cozy competence because it doesn't feel like the two parties are challenging each other that much.</p>
<p>If there's one thing that's really lost in <i>Speak Soon Vol. 1</i>, it's both artists' ability to juxtapose deep kicks, vibrant bass, and free-form drum fills against more delicate elements as a heavy tweak of light pastoralism. The thing with both producers' aesthetic is that you could soak in the big, upfront beats and then work your way down to discovering the nuances of the other, subtler elements of percussion. Here, the subtle bits ironically dominate. Aside from opener “The Way That Winter Passed Us” and closer “Movement in Mercury”, which let their low-end pulses bump with a mild urgency, the beats are pared back, clicks and drips and mild tremors instead of kicks and snares and bass. And as they ebb and flow hazily, the songs insinuate their moods instead of reveal them. It's a soothing diversion over a short span, but over the course of five to seven minutes, the reverie of cuts like “Sunday's Buzzabout” and “The Way That Wind Moves (Pt. 1)” fades out before the songs do.</p>
<p>Still, when everything clicks, it can get pretty... well, <i>pretty</i>. Sparser ambient work doesn't match up well to what these guys are usually great at, but they both have too strong a sense of melodic strangeness to botch it entirely. There's a neat trick to “A Dangerous Study of Bird Life” that isolates what sounds like a single bird chirp but rhythmically repeats it <i>ad nauseam </i>until it comes across more like a nagging alarm—a sly punchline parallel to the way they stretch out and distort warm pop sounds into decaying beauty. And other elements—the smeared, nervous-tic vocal harmonies on “The Way That Wind Moves (Pt. 2)”, or grainy chimes on “The Distance from Our Fears”—prove that there's still plenty of affecting ways to draw out the beauty of sounds when they're reconstituted from debris. As a detour from the best tendencies of Teebs and Prefuse 73, it's not the hoped-for clash of experimental beat music titans. But for two peers workshopping, it's just about diverting enough.</p></div>"|18579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18579-sons-of-the-morning-speak-soon-volume-one/|6.4|Nate Patrin

Like just about any band staring down their third decade, Elf Power have slowly but surely left many of those old ways behind. 2010's pristine, sad-eyed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14667-elf-power/"" target=""_blank""><i>Elf Power</i></a>—a tribute to their late friend and occasional collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/740-vic-chesnutt/"" target=""_blank"">Vic Chesnutt</a>—was a far cry from the fuzzed-out, freewheeling psych of the late 90s LPs these Elephant 6ers built their reputation on. The prim <i>Elf Power</i> often seemed to confuse maturity for safety, its clean, carefully composed melodies coming off more staid than surprising. <i>Sunlight on the Moon</i> buzzes and hums more like the Elf Power of old, but the songs themselves still seem a little scared of their own shadows.</p>
<p>Rieger's never been the most effusive singer, a shortcoming his clear-as-a-bell tone and oddball lyricism generally covered for. But Elf Power's recent embrace of more conventional forms—melodies, lyrics, production, you name it—leaves Rieger without much to hide behind. He sings his way through much of <i>Sunlight on the Moon</i> like he's laying down guide vocals for somebody else to come in and replace; on <i>Sunlight</i>'s title track, he sings of ""dying in the war"" and ""death… in the sky"" as though he's idly shuffling through takeout menus. As a lyricist, he's grown considerably since the f-bomb dropping ""Circular Malevolence"" era, his metaphors richer, his anxieties less overpowering. But it's gotten harder and harder to grab onto anything he's saying when all of it's sung in this dispassionate tone: ""woken and wild, I hear the screams,"" he calmly intones on ""Grotesquely Born Anew."" That makes one of us.</p>
<p>Next to the 2008 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11246-in-a-cave/"" target=""_blank""><i>In a Cave</i></a>'s flailing and<i> Elf Power</i>'s futzing, <i>Sunlight</i> can feel downright rough-and-tumble. The patina of fuzz that surrounds most of these tracks makes <i>Sunlight</i> the scrappiest Elf Power LP in some time, its scruffier numbers—""Strange Designs,"" ""Lift the Shell""—harkening back to the days crouched around the four-track. But the stripped-down approach comes at a cost; without much adornment, these songs are front-and-center, a scrutiny they're not always up for. Rieger and songwriting partner Laura Carter have penned entirely too many melodies over the years to drop the ball now. But inspiration seems to be at a minimum here; the songs have been refined to the point of stiffness, so plain as to be bloodless, the kind of thing no amount of scuzz can cover up.</p>
<p><i>Sunlight</i> has it moments; rumbling power-popper ""Lift the Shell,"" with its sci-fi feedback and baby gurgles, is an easy highlight, coming off like an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/117-the-apples-in-stereo/"" target=""_blank"">Apples in Stereo</a> tune after a bad night's sleep. The country-tinged ""Darkest Wave"" sneaks a little ""Paint It Black"" guitar into the fray, while hints of mandolin elevate the stately ""Things Lost"". The album opens up quite a bit in headphones, where the subtler instrumental flourishes sneak their way past the fuzz. Again, these songs aren't short on craft, and they're certainly never less than pretty, but their spotless structures relegate any and all surprises to the back of the mix. But, between these too-orderly melodies and Rieger's often diffident delivery, there's simply not enough here to compel the kind of close listen you'd need to work out all of <i>Sunlight</i>'s wrinkles. ""The floor is not collapsing, the roof's not caving in"" Rieger sings on ""You're Never Gonna Go to Heaven"". That's the trouble with <i>Sunlight on the Moon</i>; things are just fine, but 12 albums in, just fine's not quite fine enough.</p></div>"|18580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18580-elf-power-sunlight-on-the-moon/|5.5|Paul Thompson

This charming and occasionally exasperating quality plays a big part in defining his quasi-solo project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31610-into-it-over-it"">Into It. Over It.</a> But if you’re new to Weiss’ output, the backstory is worth relating—prior to his 2011 debut <i>Proper</i>, he'd gained notoriety around Chicago for starting seemingly dozens of bands and serving as a liaison between the upperclassmen of Midwestern emo (Their/They’re/There with Mike Kinsella) and the younger kids establishing the new vanguard. He lived in a van for a spell, playing pretty much every basement and house party that would have him and spent 2007 writing a new song every week. The <i>52 Weeks </i>collection was finally released in 2009 and many of these songs were titled with the kind of breathtaking mundanity (“Friday At Brian’s (I Have to Be Up in Four Hours)”, “Dude-A-Form (Dude Uniform)” and geographical obsessiveness (“Rapid Shitty, SD”) that presumably went the way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1706-the-get-up-kids/"" target=""_blank"">the Get Up Kids</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, <i>Proper</i> often sounded like a record from a guy too deep in the game, “thinking simple and putting life to ink,” as Weiss puts it on <i>Intersections</i> highlight “Obsessive Compulsive Distraction”, an album of sharply written songs that were often dulled by snark and an assumption that you got all the inside jokes and cared about scene politics as much as he did. So like most of IIOI’s work, the proper nouns are less important than the underlying emotion in the mission statement of “New North-Side Air"". On <i>Intersections</i>, it’s “new air” that matters, regardless of its source, and with the assistance of Brian Deck’s production, Weiss’ world opens up in every way and becomes a much more welcoming place to visit.</p>
<p>If not explicitly stated, the aforementioned fresh air registers as an autumn breeze, as the music itself has the physiological feel of a transition season—the crisp brightness and soft-focus melodies make a lot more sense now than they did when I first heard them in summer. And the places referenced by Weiss throughout—suburban Philadelphia, upstate New York and New Haven, CT—evoke college campuses, the turning of foliage and a perpetual amber hue. Deck’s sympathetic production leaves plenty of room for a draft to come through, or, mostly a chill. The songs here anticipate relationships headed towards a bitter frost rather than springing into torrid passion.</p>
<p>Then again, most of the conflicts promised by the title of <i>Intersections</i> play out within Weiss, “just spinning wheels, spinning thread and my spinning head."" It’s cerebral music in that way, where most conversations appear to be one-sided and happening after the fact. And musically, Weiss hears completely logical structure in his head, whereas the listeners encounters all kinds of obtuse turns and strange bridges even within a loose verse-chorus template. This was by design: in an effort to avoid falling back on the pop-punk tropes that otherwise propped up <i>Proper</i>, Weiss plays without a pick on <i>Intersections</i> and drummer Nick Wakim disassembled much of his cymbal setup. </p>
<p>The result is just familiar enough to be referential without becoming derivative—Weiss’ deft, rambling fingerpicked patterns bear a strong influence of Mike Kinsella’s <i>Owen</i>, though IIOI is far more melodic and compact. In his softer vocal register, there’s a boyish and bookish cloaking of mean-spirited sentiments that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6101-ben-gibbard"">Ben Gibbard</a>. You’re not gonna mistake <i>Intersections</i> for Deck’s work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/651-califone"">Califone</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse"">Modest Mouse</a>, though you can hear his influence in how it sounds more rustic and more electronic than <i>Proper</i>—the clacking percussion, ringing guitars and looped vocals in “Contractual Obligations” and “A Curse Worth Believing” stand out as Weiss’ most complex studio productions by a good margin.</p>
<p>But <i>Intersections</i> is also cerebral is the way one might translate as “too smart for its own good.” Weiss hasn’t lost his taste for breakup songs that foreground the narrator’s clever observations as a means of giving him the upper hand. On “Spatial Exploration”, Weiss reminds an ex of the “after hours trading X-rated favors” before asking “what is this new person you’ve become?” She’s getting her shit together in a suburban kind of way, and Weiss doesn’t even allow the possibility that she could be in a happier place. Later during “Upstate Blues”, he warns someone to leave a cozy town where drinkers “soak their twenties into tens/ it’s like their twenties never end.” It’s seemingly compassionate, though lyrics like “upstate blues they could paint your room/ cold and gray like New York and you” reveal a passive-aggressiveness behind it. It’s a standard emo pitfall that can mar otherwise exceedingly melodic and cleverly structured songs, and while perversely satisfying in the correct doses, but the oft accusatory tone of <i>Intersections</i> might unintentionally cause you to see things from the other person’s side.</p>
<p>Above all other transitions invoked on <i>Intersections,</i> the most crucial occurs in the second half where Weiss evolves into more compassionate narrator. “No Amount of Sound” is his riskiest song, a slowcore lament for a hospitalized friend that drops any semblance of humor for incapacitating despondence. Meanwhile, the first half of “The Shaking of Leaves” could be mistaken for a relationship post-mortem where Weiss feels actual sadness rather than justified resentment. Instead, it’s a sequel to <i>Proper</i>’s “Connecticut Steps”, where Weiss tried to process the murder of his friend Mitch Dubey, a musician and cyclist in New Haven. <a href=""http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/dubey_verdict/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The news surrounding Dubey’s murder </a>raised a lot of uncomfortable questions about race and economics in a very stratified city and makes the concerns of <i>Intersections,</i> as big as they are in the moment of experiencing them, feel pretty damn minute.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And yet, with so much to untangle, ""The Shaking of Leaves"" finds Weiss deferring for a simple mourning, at his most concise and his most powerful. In a melody that could pass for an Irish drinking song, he feels relief, even joy when the New Haven newspaper says that a killer’s been named. And then he recoils in disgust when it’s revealed the accused gunman is 19 (Tashaun Fair was found not guilty after what many criticized as a botched investigation).

He made great strides playing the preening, streetwise Mase to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a>’s Diddy on songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/""><i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i></a>’s “Runaway” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16994-cruel-summer/""><i>Cruel Summer</i></a>’s “New God Flow”, but it took him a few releases (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15277-fear-of-god/""><i>Fear of God</i></a>, a patchy stab at bygone Re-Up Gang mixtape glory, and its sometimes distractingly star-studded sequel <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16010-fear-of-god-ii/""><i>Fear of God II: Let Us Pray</i></a>) to find his footing on his own. When he did, on January’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17758-pusha-t-wrath-of-caine/""><i>Wrath of Caine</i></a>, he surfaced snarling over trap beats. The mixtape often subsisted off the sheer intensity of his delivery, and it placed him in lockstep with the mainstream rap zeitgeist. But it also cut him off from the flashy new-money arrogance of the first 10 years of his career, and it suffered in spots thanks to a noticeably diminished lyricism. Push flounders without a hands-on producer, it would seem. For his major label debut, <i>My Name Is My Name</i>, Kanye West is that guiding light.</p>
<p>Kanye never utters a word here, Auto-Tuned scatting on “Hold On” notwithstanding, but the sound and scope of the record are unmistakably Westian. The blaring fanfare and hyperactive drum programming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"" target=""_blank"">Hudson Mohawke</a> and Beewirks brought to “No Regrets” are direct descendants of <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>’s “All of the Lights”. On opener “King Push”, Kanye and Sebastian Sartor reprise the vocal sample from the breakdown in “New Slaves”, pinching and distending it into funhouse versions of itself over horror movie synth stabs. Kanye’s production with DJ Mano on “Who I Am” advances the dark, austere <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a> vibe as it melds oft-used samples (the “Yeah!” from Mountain’s “Long Red” and the frantic lick from South Bronx dance-punk pioneers ESG’s “UFO”) and a swatch of Warp producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28964-kwes/"">Kwes</a>’ serene “LGOYH” into something leagues more sinister than its requisite elements. <i>My Name Is My Name</i> is borne out of the same minimal, uncompromising darkness as <i>Yeezus</i>, but its communion with radio rap values delivers on the accessibility that listeners put out by <i>Yeezus</i>’ monomaniacal hellishness clamored for.</p>
<p><i>My Name Is My Name</i> makes concessions for radio accessibility, but it’s never rankled by them. Guests grace nearly every track, but where they gobbled up real estate that should’ve been Pusha’s on <i>Fear of God II</i>, on <i>My Name Is My Name</i>, they’re mostly tasked with giving Pusha’s impish abandon wings. Frequent alley oops from singers scan as shots at offsetting the brass tacks boom bap of “Numbers on the Boards” and “Nosetalgia” with hooks, but Pusha seems wholly unfazed by any of it. He nets a beat from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"">the-Dream</a> and a lilting Kelly Rowland hook on “Let Me Love You” and effects a Mase flow so spot-on you’ll look for him in the liner notes. Elsewhere a disembodied, wraithlike Chris Brown’s good life platitudes on “Sweet Serenade” are waylaid by at every turn by gun-toting mogul talk.</p>
<p>Rappers get the same treatment. Trap clown prince <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a> and dick joke dispenser <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"" target=""_blank"">Big Sean</a> are so outmatched on “Who I Am” that they hang back to play comic relief. (2 Chainz wins here: “Entrepreneur/ Strip club connoisseur/ Hot fudge sundae/ Pour it on you, hallelujah”). On “Hold On”, Pusha sneers about studio gangsters who never sold drugs, then cedes verse two to corrections officer turned crack rap kingpin <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a> brings the expected lyrical pyrotechnics to “Nosetalgia”, matching Pusha’s verse about growing up a dealer with reminiscences of a childhood profoundly affected by family members’ drug use, and it’s the only time an outside voice comes close to stealing the show.</p>
<p>Though <i>My Name Is My Name</i> can feel like a moon around Kanye West’s recent work, the star here is unquestionably a reinvigorated Pusha T. This is never more apparent than on the minor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5634-re-up-gang/"" target=""_blank"">Re-Up Gang</a> reunion cut “Suicide”, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"" target=""_blank"">Pharrell</a> provides a skittering metallic bounce with pitch 808s in place of a bassline, and Pusha and Ab-Liva trade bars with a zeal that’s been missing since the Clipse started to wither on 2009’s <i>Til the Casket Drops</i>. The rhymes on “Suicide” and the rest of <i>My Name Is My Name</i> are a cut above what we’ve come to expect from post-Clipse Pusha. He’s finally figured out how to marry the unlabored lyrical dexterity and unflappable cool of earlier work to the vengeful, bottomless menace of the new material. Pusha’s released a fair amount of music since joining Kanye’s G.O.O.D. Music army three years ago, but <i>My Name Is My Name</i> is really the first release that delivers on the excitement initially engendered by the pairing.</p></div>"|18277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18277-pusha-t-my-name-is-my-name/|8.0|Craig Jenkins

After all, his two prior full-lengths were packed with frenetic crowd-pleasers, and even the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17454-liquid-ep/"" target=""_blank"">collaborative EP</a> he recorded with his producer Boody, which flirted hard and heavy with ambient music, had a dance-floor-ready single in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14588-soda/"" target=""_blank"">“Soda""</a>. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Aside from the rowdy, anthemic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15916-le1f-damn-son/"" target=""_blank"">“Damn Son”</a> (which perfectly flips the Trap-a-holics iconic mixtape drop), his third LP is the sound of that flirtation being consummated, a potently chill record built around echoing washes of synthesizers and unhurried tempos. Its second track, “Cane Sugar"", glides in at a modest 68 BPM, with its melody coming from reverb-dripping bells and Le1f’s voice multitracked and pitch-shifted in a way that underlines the song’s syrupy pace. On any other rap album this would be the spacey experimental track slipped in on the second half; here it qualifies as a relatively eager pop number.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If Le1f’s first two mixtapes were about proving that he can compete on the same level as any other rapper in the game—and after the phenomenal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17682-fly-zone/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fly Zone</i></a> it’s hard to imagine how anyone could argue he can’t—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52336-le1f-shares-tree-house-mixtape-announces-tour/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tree House</i></a> feels like having done so, he’s moved on to other more challenging pursuits. Like staking out his own space even further out from hip-hop’s core, where rap, R&amp;B, and dance music’s avant garde have started to bleed into one another. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>He may be working far enough out on pop’s fringe to still be considered wild country, but he’s not alone out there. The first (and stronger) half of the album was produced almost entirely by Boody, Vangelis-loving Chicago duo The-Drum, and the relatively unknown NYC beatmaker Shy Guy. Although each has a distinctive style they all mesh exceptionally well, bound by a shared affection for syncopated R&amp;B rhythms, minimalist arrangements, and combinations of tones and reverb that suggest dark, cavernous, aquatic spaces, as if the album was recorded in some kind of digitally simulated underground lake.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The record’s consistent sonic identity is matched with an equally consistent lyrical theme, which is a deep enough appreciation of freaky sex to qualify as legitimately <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a>-like, with lyrics that swerve between playfully cajoling would-be lovers to prayerful odes to physical intimacy. While he’s never been shy when it comes to talking about sex, Tree House finds Le1f intensifying his focus on on it, and in the process laying claim to part of the soul music lover man tradition, complete with spoken word interludes and entire songs devoted to the topic of sensual oils.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The move from the club to the bedroom has brought with it a change in Le1f’s vocal style. As a rapper he’s always been more concerned than most with emphasizing melody and texture in his performances, and by leaning on them even more, as he does on <i>Tree House</i>, takes him right up to the point of actually singing. Occasionally he steps right across it, as on the Drum-produced “Swerve"", which with his echo-laden, Auto-Tuned vocal hook ranks among the best druggy R&amp;B moments in a year that’s offered plenty of them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The twisty artistic path that Le1f’s chosen himself has brought him close to being the anti-Drake: a melody-minded rapper with a taste for nocturnal sounds but without the sexual hangups and pathological materialism. It’s a surprising move for a musician who’s made his name on club-friendly jams, but it’s becoming obvious that following Le1f’s career is going to involve making a lot of unexpected turns. If he keeps making them so expertly that should be no problem.</span></p></div>"|18506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18506-le1f-tree-house/|7.7|Miles Raymer

But he is nonetheless the Strokesiest of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a>—if you were to ever dress up as a Stroke for Halloween, you’d be copping Hammond’s one-size-too-small thrift-store sports jacket, skinny tie, Chuck Taylors, and hair <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlbunmCbTBA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">photoshopped off of Billy Ficca's head on the first Television album cover</a>.  Accordingly, out of all the extracurricular projects the Strokes have pursued over the years, Hammond’s solo releases have hewed most closely to the band’s bleary-eyed, tousled charm and classicist tendencies.</p>
<p>However, in the five years since Hammond’s last album, the Strokes have moved further and further away from that signature scrappy sound, expanding their sonic vocabulary with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7539-first-impressions-of-earth/"" target=""_blank"">notoriously</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15230-angles/"" target=""_blank"">mixed</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17788-the-strokes-comedown-machine/"" target=""_blank"">results</a>. Perhaps not coincidentally, Hammond’s new EP sticks to the narrowest of L.E.S. lanes. Where 2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9509-yours-to-keep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yours to Keep</i></a> and 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11989-como-te-llama/"" target=""_blank""><i>¿Cómo te Llama?</i></a> presented homespun interpretations of Hammond’s most iconic inspirations (John Lennon, the Beach Boys, Bob Marley), on <i>AHJ</i> he mines a more easily attainable influence: his own band circa 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Hammond has recently come clean about the various hard-drug habits that plagued him throughout the Strokes’ ascent, which he finally kicked shortly after the release of <i>¿Cómo Te Llama?.</i> As such, there’s a sense that Hammond is forcefully hitting the reset button here, stripping his songs back down to the basics, and regaining his confidence by playing within his comfort zone. (He handles all the instrumental parts on the record, save for drums.) Running a mere five songs and 15 minutes, <i>AHJ</i> is a wholly fat-free effort that favors tight, snappy, emotionally direct songcraft over the genre experiments and instrumental excursions of <i>¿Cómo Te Llama?</i> that suggested Hammond was headed down a more ponderous path.</p>
<p>Hammond may not be as casually charismatic as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7320-julian-casablancas/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Casablancas</a>, and his songs can be modest and unassuming to a fault—the gently loping ""St. Justice"" is not so much an opening salvo as a warm-up exercise to check the levels of each instrument. But he brings a convincing poignancy and urgency when required. “Strange Tidings” recalls the dream-pop drive of “Hard to Explain”, yet lines like “If I’m guilty/ It’ll show” and “control is so hard to find” provide sobering reminders of a time when Hammond had to wear long sleeves even on the hottest summer days. But while oblique references to Hammond’s darkest hours abound on <i>AHJ</i> (“Cooker Ship” conjures images of burnt spoons and bottoming-out in the sort of fantastical terms his hero-turned-buddy Bob Pollard would appreciate), the energy here is one of spirited, defiant revitalization. And in the amazingly compact “Rude Customer”, Hammond turns in a song that would’ve been the hands-down highlight on any of the past three Strokes albums. If you're precisely the sort of disenchanted old-school Strokes fan who would respond to that with, ""Well, that's not saying much,"" then the lean econo-pop of <i>AHJ</i> will feel all the more like a gift. </p></div>"|18600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18600-albert-hammond-jr-ahj-ep/|6.8|Stuart Berman

When it works, it takes hold completely, engulfing your attention, encroaching on your thought processes. When it doesn't, well, you may just find yourself getting <i>verrry</i> sleepy. <i>Sway</i>'s a far more captivating set than 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13757-ghost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghost</i></a>, but when the trance starts to falter, <i>Sway</i>'s daze turns anesthetic.</p>
<p>Recorded between Austin and San Diego—with the drums and bass laid into 2"" tape—<i>Sway</i>'s sound is rarely less than stellar. Unlike the hiss-mired <i>Ghost</i>, which often sounded beamed in from afar, <i>Sway</i> is considerably more enveloping, placing the listener in the center of the storm. The brief symphonic feedback swell of opener ""EGBDF"" gives way to the detuned, downtrodden ""Slow Hell"", a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>-esque bummer trip that finds a bleary Travis Trevisan recounting late-night drives and snorted breakfasts. Hero worship aside, the loping, ominous ""Hell"" could be the finest TDM track to date, all snarling guitars and red-eyed murmurings. But dream popper ""Always Lie"" gets bogged down by its helicoptering reverb, and ""Half Life"", despite its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4045-kevin-shields/"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Shields</a>-style whale-calls, eventually starts to meander.</p>
<p>Yet it's not until ""That's You"" that <i>Sway</i> starts to lose its hold. Built around a thudding, lockstep bassline, ""That's You"" plods along listlessly, taking its sweet time going nowhere. As Zach Kelly wrote in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13757-ghost/"" target=""_blank"">review of <i>Ghost</i></a>, Tape Deck Mountain fare best ""where guitars crash and sequencers explode."" When they pull things back, as they do through much of the album's second half, the spell they cast elsewhere is broken in a way they struggle to recapture. ""PI"" is <i>Sway</i> at its most melodic, its cascading guitars and propulsive drums crashing into a giant yearning chorus. But it's quickly swallowed up by ""Pretend Friends"", a loud-quiet-loud proto-grunge nod that ambles along without much aim until a short, sidewinding solo slips into the frame halfway through. Things don't get much better from there: the torpid ""Mystics"" is a sketch in search of a song, while ""PI II"", despite a decent hook and some wriggly guitar interplay, takes a couple good ideas and runs them into the ground. Husher closer ""Meta"" smacks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4767-drums-not-dead/"" target=""_blank""><i>Drum's Not Dead</i></a>-era Liars, finding Trevisan moaning in watery falsetto over a hissing synthetic pulse. The focused intensity of ""Meta"" is a nice antidote to all the wandering that precedes it, but it finishes <i>Sway</i> with a whisper, when it could probably use another scream.</p>
<p>Between Trevisan's cryptic tone—save the up-front ""Slow Hell"", his vocals tend to get swallowed up, only the occasional muttering about Aleister Crowley floating to the surface—and his roundabout compositions, <i>Sway</i>'s a tough record to get your head around. Though mercifully devoid of <i>Ghost</i>'s overlong ambient interludes and its ghastly ""asshole Larry"" lyrics, between its pacing and grayscale palette, <i>Sway</i>'s just too terse to for rapture and too noncommittal for mystery. Tape Deck Mountain's heavy-lidded narcosis can be transfixing, but when the songs start to drift, the mind starts to wander.</p></div>"|18581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18581-tape-deck-mountain-sway/|6.0|Paul Thompson

During the many times I found my attention wavering during the duration of <i>Hunters</i>, I tried to imagine what those shows might look like, without consulting YouTube or Google Image Search to spoil the surprise. I picture Derek Watson with a dark, matted haircut, dressed entirely in denim and leather with some flannel, snarled upper lip but also a bit playful and laconic. On the other side, there’s Izzy Almeida, playing in the back until her vocals come in, and when they do, she <i>really</i> puts herself into it. Maybe a combination of Alice Glass and Alexis Krauss, a similarly hell-bent-for-leather cockiness, lots of facial expressions, visible tattoos and maybe a shock of dyed hair. As it turns out, that’s not far off, but I’m not gonna give myself a lot of credit—that’s a standard archetype when you hear grungy fuzz guitars and sneering vocals within a coed pop construct. It exists for a reason. So, on some count, <i>Hunters</i> is successful in providing a visual of what the band looks like for the people who have yet to see them in action. Problem is that even after a dozen or so listens, I have no idea what Hunters actually <i>are</i> like.</p>
<p><i>Hunters</i> signifies a generic scare-quote “attitude” on a micro level—the distortion here is of the Big Muff or Rat pedal variety, none of that tasteful tube amp stuff. Both Watson and Almeida take on an adult-adolescent vocal style, which neutralizes whatever friction you’d get from their give and go interplay—I suppose both sexes sound kinda the same when projecting from the nasal passage. But in the big picture, <i>Hunters</i> is perfectly palatable in any way that matters. The duo position themselves as a missing link between 90s grunge and the beer-swilling, noisy art-pop of NYC in the early 00s, two styles that have little in common other than an emphasis on dynamics which <i>Hunters </i>sorely lacks: in practice, it's as mesmeric and even-keeled as a Kraut-rock record.</p>
<p>For the most part, a Hunters song consists of a riff that plods and chugs for a couple bars while Watson sings a clipped, major-key melody and after he’s done, it lunges slightly one way or the other. After a couple of measures of that, the vocals trade off nearly similar cadences at nearly similar intervals. If there’s a clean guitar being played, a distorted one is no more than 30 seconds away and it’ll likely churn out some variation of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxTVGC1UbMc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle”</a>. And yet, both the “loud” and “quiet” parts sound like they’re being played at the same volume. I imagine Hunters would be the first to tell us that this isn’t meant to be intellectualized—the lyrics really don’t offer themselves up for much analysis, and they’re also sung in a way that lets you know your attention is best directed elsewhere. But trying to elucidate real differences between these songs, most of which are titled like shabby chic colognes (“Narcissist”, “Street Trash”, “Seizure”, “Blackheart”), requires a laser-guided focus and a litigator’s knack for parsing minutiae through nuanced language.</p>
<p>On a macro scale, Hunters seem awfully algorithmic as well, a band that could conceivably open for every one of their fellow acts on the Mom + Pop roster without stealing their thunder. On “Street Trash” and “It’s True”, the sound of cheerleading vocals over distorted guitars instantly recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells"">Sleigh Bells</a>, but as a band that’s less beholden to noise <i>or</i> pure pop, Hunters do little to keep you from listening to Sleigh Bells instead. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves"">Wavves</a>, they build hooks upon a handful of heaving power chords as a reflex, but Hunters manifest little of Nathan Williams’ ambitions for variegated production; after a first half of five almost indistinguishable songs, you see “Nosebleed” topping over six minutes and wonder how the hell it’s going to get there. They throw in a tempo switch about halfway through and “Nosebleed” is really just two Hunters songs stitched together. And yeah, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29998-fidlar/"">FIDLAR</a> you figure they drink cheap beer, but they lack anything remotely resembling that band’s frightening commitment to their own debasement. Which is fine, plenty of us have gone to work at 8AM totally relieved we decided against shotgunning that last beer or downing that Jager bomb. The problem is that <i>Hunters</i> doesn’t really deliver in the moment either, as it’s not much different than reading about those wild, unpredictable shows of theirs as opposed to being there—all you think about is the fun you’re not having.</p></div>"|18532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18532-hunters-hunters/|4.9|Ian Cohen

Like all records that don’t quite sound like anything before, you either loved it or hated it, but you couldn’t ignore it.</p>
<p>Finding damaged beauty in distortion and compression, <i>Treats</i> sounded magnificently charred, like it had been recorded on the only console to survive Armageddon. After its success, Sleigh Bells got the opportunity to make the transition to hi-fi, and there was reason to worry that squeaky-clean production might extinguish what made them original in the first place. But their 2012 sophomore album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16297-reign-of-terror/"" target=""_blank""><i>Reign of Terror</i></a> did ""pulverizingly loud"" in a different, though equally distinct way: It had the cavernous and slightly haunting atmosphere of a collection of songs recorded in an empty stadium. One of its best tracks was called ""Crush""—a title that compacted all of Sleigh Bells' tensions and contradictions into a single syllable. ""I got a crush on you,"" Krauss cooed, but in the very same breath she flashed a switchblade, ""I gotta crush you <i>now</i>.""</p>
<p>For their third album, <i>Bitter Rivals</i>, Sleigh Bells have made a few more tweaks to the formula. They've embraced more varied instrumentation—see: the lightning-strike synths on ""Sing Like A Wire""; the menacingly strummed acoustic guitar that opens ""Bitter Rivals""—and added a drummer to their live show. But most notably, they've become more creatively democratic. Miller handled the lyrics, music, and production on the previous records, but on <i>Bitter Rivals</i> Krauss wrote most of the melodies. The material she's composed for herself does allow her to show more range—<i>Bitter Rivals</i> features both Krauss's most tuneful and aggressive vocals yet, sometimes within the same song—but overall it is the work of a band enduring some growing pains. The good news is that Sleigh Bells have new ideas, but the often-undercooked <i>Bitter Rivals</i> shows they haven't yet found effective ways to execute many of them.</p>
<p>And it doesn't take long for this to become apparent. Opening track and lead-off single ""Bitter Rivals"" starts off with a misleadingly minimalist, showdown-at-high-noon vibe, but it soon becomes a cluttered and unrelenting mess of chunky power chords, high-voltage synthesizers, and near-Karmin-grade rapping—all heaped on top of each other with little rhyme or reason. The same goes for the puzzlingly stilted ""Sing Like a Wire"", which feels so disjointed it's like the verse, bridge, and chorus were dragged-and-dropped from three different songs. The hook hits like an earthquake, but there's no build; the drop appears so suddenly that it doesn't quite feel earned.</p>
<p>Compare these songs to the sleek, expertly controlled chaos of <i>Treats</i>, and you get the impression Krauss and Miller are still getting the hang of how to write effectively together. They've also lost a bit of the spark that once made their production so thrilling. Sleigh Bells usually have a knack for turning sounds just on the edge of punishing into something deeply, viscerally pleasurable (on the first couple listens <i>Treats</i> seemed like the sort of thing that might permanently damage your hearing), but <i>Bitter Rivals</i> contains a few of the only Sleigh Bells songs that can rightfully be dismissed as ""grating."" The worst offender here is the hellish chorus of ""Minnie"", which takes what are already Krauss's most uncomfortably piercing backing vocals and, cruelly, pitches them up. I'm pretty sure there are frequencies in this song that only dogs can hear.</p>
<p>The slower, less insistent songs on <i>Bitter Rivals</i> fare better. The R&amp;B-inflected ""Young Legends"" showcases the album's strongest melody, but it's unfortunate that the song's hesitant and ill-fitting production (at least half of Krauss's vocals come through sputtered and muffled like walkie-talkie transmissions) holds it back from fully blooming. The mid-tempo ""Tiger Kit"" is a more effective display of restraint; its do-or-die urgency (""You're gonna jump from that cathedral/ In front of all of these people"") is subtly kindled by synth hits that fire on cue but duck out before they overwhelm the arrangement. One of the album's brightest spots, though, is also its quietest: the airy ballad ""To Hell With You"" shows off Krauss's vocals with minimal effects, and its lyrics slyly toy with the expectations set by its brazen title. Like ""Crush"", it's partially a kiss-off, but the undertones are unexpectedly sweet: ""I'll go to hell with you/ Here's the proof."" It's a rare and welcome moment of pause on a record that often feels cramped, rushed, and cluttered. Much has been made of the fact that it was mixed by Andrew Dawson, who also worked on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a><span>, but what this record really could have used is a <a href=""http://news.rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-zane-lowe-bbc-radio-interview-part-1-lyrics#note-2238757"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reducer</a>.</span></p>
<p>In 2013, it’s no longer enough to simply be <i>loud</i>. To command attention in a world that's already blaring with distractions, interruptions, and no shortage of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_6CZ2JaEuc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">airhorns</a>, a record needs to be loud in a creative, compelling, and previously unexplored way. Sleigh Bells have proven that they know this better than almost anybody making music right now, and that's why <i>Bitter Rivals</i> feels like an exceptionally unfortunate misstep. It isn't enough of a disaster to put a dent in their solid fanbase, but it doesn't have the spark of the stuff that built it up in the first place. <i>Treats</i> had the wildly aerodynamic dips of an elegantly constructed roller coaster—think of that rolling riff that careens through ""A/B Machines"", or the surprise ending of ""Infinity Guitars"" when a song that goes up to 11 reveals, only in the last 40 seconds, that it actually goes up to 12. <i>Bitter Rivals</i> too often feels like a cheap thrill ride, firing on all cylinders but without any grand design.</p></div>"|18594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18594-sleigh-bells-bitter-rivals/|5.9|Lindsay Zoladz

Chilton's three albums with Big Star are stone classics; his subsequent recording career was spotty, and after 1987's <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OGaMOaFDpY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">High Priest</a></i> he never made a particularly worthwhile studio album. The last 20 years of his life yielded a few <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0yXLva9HaA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sterile-to-perverse</a> records, the cash-in of the Box Tops and Big Star reunions, and not much else besides live shows that the faithful swore were sometimes really good, if Alex was in the mood.</p>
<p>What was going to be Chilton's second set at the Knitting Factory in New York City on a February night in 1997 was cancelled when the power went out. But somebody happened to have an acoustic guitar on hand, and there were some candles, and so Chilton decided to play a few songs for those audience members who were still hanging around. That turned into an impromptu 17-song set of covers that one Jeff Vargon happened to catch on tape.</p>
<p>It's wonderful—a mess, but a marvelous mess. Chilton opens with a pair of far-out-of-the-way country readymades, ""Last Bouquet"" (a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5m2xcguLHw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1959 Clyde Owens B-side</a>) and ""Step Right This Way"" (from a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oBEvkNyupw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1971 album</a> that songwriter Glen Sherley recorded while in prison); one of Chilton's odder gifts was the ability to tell when some utterly forgotten song would sound great with his cracking, tremulous voice. After that, he mostly shifts to standards--""Lovesick Blues"", ""I Walk the Line"", ""The Girl from Ipanema""—occasionally with the audience joining in, campfire-style.</p>
<p>The crowd shouts requests for his old favorites, which he shoots down, although he revives a couple of jazz tunes from his 1993 album <i>Clichés</i>. The only song from Big Star's repertoire that turns up is a cover: Loudon Wainwright III's groupie-schtupping ballad <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKqZZg2U6t4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Motel Blues""</a>. This CD gilds the lily by ending with a studio recording of another country cover, Johnny Lee's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23Wgt3Bjj6g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Can Bet Your Heart on Me""</a>, which is admittedly a little more dignified than the set's actual closer, an ""If I Had a Hammer"" that disintegrates into ridiculousness. (""If I had a potato..."")</p>
<p><i>Electricity by Candlelight</i> shows off Chilton's instrumental virtuosity and his impressive memory for songs. Show me someone who knows all the chords to ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" offhand and I'll show you a Beach Boy, but Chilton knocks it out with no problem, then follows it with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxo9dngR9ig"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Surfer Girl""</a> and ""Solar System."" (He bluffs his way through a single verse of Joni Mitchell's ""A Case of You,"" but <i>come on</i>.) The real joy of this set, though, is that it gives us what Chilton's later career promised but rarely delivered. He's not trying to flip anyone off, or working out torment, or phoning in the oldies with former bandmates and acolytes. He's just a great busker, having a really good time with his tiny audience. </p></div>"|18542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18542-alex-chilton-electricity-by-candlelight/|8.1|Douglas Wolk

Canning's kept busy in the half-decade since that album's release with a wide variety of activities, from Broken Social Scene's studio swan song (2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14200-forgiveness-rock-record/""><i>Forgiveness Rock Record</i></a>) to film scores (this year's Lindsay Lohan comeback vehicle <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2292959/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Canyons</i></a>) to a complex, mysterious interactive multimedia endeavor involving director David Cronenberg and a biotech lab. Given the scope of these projects, it's easy to understand why Canning's approach to his new solo record <i>You Gots 2 Chill</i> was decidedly laid-back and homespun: he put together his own independent label to handle the album's release (named for his home street, tucked into the heart of downtown Toronto), drew the cover art himself, and recorded without help from any of his Broken Social Scene associates. The album title isn't a command to listeners—it's a note to self, the kind of thing you'd throw on a Post-It note and stick onto your fridge. </span></p>
<p><span>The music contained within <i>You Gots 2 Chill</i> is true to the album's low-key origins and winking title. Every track is built up around a spine of fingerpicked acoustic guitar and many stop there, content to exist without vocals or instrumental embellishment; Canning draws a rough-hewn, earthen beauty from the strings on tracks like the misty ""Never Go to the Races"" and the wistful ""Last Song for the Summer Hideaway"". There's a refreshing sense of humor present in the album's song titles and sequencing: ""Makes You Motor"" chuckles at its unhurried mid-tempo groove, while the frisky ""Plugged In"" lives off the grid just like the rest of the record. Taken together, this sense of humor and the album's unadorned songwriting combine to give <i>You Gots 2 Chill</i>, and Canning, a charmingly unpretentious vibe. That's not to say that the record is entirely devoid of fully realized songs: cuts like the bubbling, slowly layered ""However Long"" and the pedal steel-flecked lead single ""Bullied Days"" (sung by Snowblink's Daniela Gesundheit) are fleshed out without sacrificing Canning's ear for gentle, slowly shifting melody. </span></p>
<p><span><i>You Gots 2 Chill</i> also pays quiet tribute to the sound and feel of analog technology, with two interludes (""Long Live Land Lines"" and ""Once a Lighthouse"") recorded directly onto Canning's voicemail and placed onto the album. He tips his cap at the influence of the experimental acoustic guitarist John Fahey on album opener ""Post Fahey"", and by devoting the remainder of the album to an exploration of the instrument's melodic possibilities and moods, he makes a decent argument for its continued relevance. But <i>You Gots 2 Chill</i>'s defining characteristic is also its key weakness: if listeners fail to grant each new mid-tempo acoustic number its fair share of attention, they begin to blur together into one large mid-tempo acoustic blob. This is a bedtime record, in both the complementary and dismissive senses of the word: it invites you to relax and soothes like a warm cup of tea, but can cross the line into powerfully soporific territory. </span></p></div>"|18575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18575-brendan-canning-you-gots-2-chill/|6.7|Jamieson Cox

Both are compilations of rare and unreleased tracks; both offer everything from short vignettes to fleshed-out, 10-minute-plus journeys; and both paint a pretty comprehensive picture of the ideas and skills each artist brought to their work in now-defunct Emeralds. Both even use a fluorescent blue color palette on their covers.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that Hauschildt ripped McGuire off—tons of artists have put out similar compilations—nor that his work should automatically be judged next to that of former comrades. But the two share a musical method that remains fascinating. As noted in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15420-a-young-persons-guide-to-mark-mcguire/""><i>Pitchfork's</i> review</a> of the McGuire set, the guitarist finds “remarkable flexibility” in a narrow stylistic range. The same goes for Hauschildt’s synth-based work on <i>S/H</i>. Its tones and moods are devoutly consistent, yet it’s richly engaging throughout.</p>
<p>Part of that is due, somewhat paradoxically, to the lower-stakes nature of <i>S/H</i>. Many of its pieces have a work-in-progress feel, moreso than the developed, honed material on Hauschildt’s previous albums. There was a lot to like on those—especially 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16119-tragedy-geometry/"">Tragedy &amp; Geometry</a></i>—but I prefer him in this kind of lab-rat, see-what-sticks mode. Nothing here sounds tossed off, but Hauschildt doesn't always feel obligated to stretch each idea into an ebb-and-flow song. He’s happy to focus on a single sonic concept, then pursue another one on the next track rather than forcing them to work together. This tack has the added effect of making Hauschildt’s wallpaper-y pieces, which can sometimes feel like filler, more integral, serving as transitions and pace-changers between more gripping tracks.</p>
<p>The draft-ish quality of <i>S/H</i> also makes it<i> </i>more personal than Hauschildt’s previous releases. These are instrumental, sometimes abstract pieces in which the human action that created each sound isn’t always obvious. Yet I often feel I’m getting a glimpse at the machinations of Hauschildt’s mind. His particular way of toying with ideas and sketching patterns is probing without sounding rushed. Ripples, squiggles, waves, beats, and rising chords all unfurl with the patience of a meditation. But I don’t picture Hauschildt reclined behind his instruments when I listen. Instead I imagine him leaned over his tools, pushing them to replicate the sounds in his head.</p>
<p>That image is most vivid on disc one, comprising 21 previously-unreleased tracks recorded between 2010 and 2012. Everything Hauschildt is good at gets covered here, especially his way of generating emotion and tension with ostensibly mellow tones. Sprinkled throughout are some more outward-bound pieces, like the field-recording-like “Flyswatter” and the sci-fi stunner “Flatbed Scanner”, that extend Hauschildt’s reach without diminishing his grasp. Disc two generally feels more settled. Drones and longer tones are more frequent in these pieces made between 2005 and 2009. There’s still some forward-moving stuff to dig into, and lots of ways to become transfixed by Hauschildt’s extended sounds. But anyone inclined toward his pulse-heavy side will likely set disc one on repeat before drifting into disc two.</p>
<p>It seems just as likely that any Emeralds followers underwhelmed by their 2012 swan song, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17276-just-to-feel-anything/"">Just to Feel Anything</a>, </i>will find reasons in <i>S/H </i>to renew their optimism about Hauschildt's musical future. I imagine he would welcome that response, since, as with McGuire’s solo work, <i>S/H </i>is music designed for positivity, even when it sounds solemn or melancholy. By the end of its two and a half hours, negativity is about the farthest thing from my mind.</p></div>"|18540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18540-steve-hauschildt-sh/|7.5|Marc Masters

But listen to the final seconds of ""Across The Horizon"", the final track from the Omaha band Yuppies' self-titled record, and it seems pretty clear guitarist/vocalist Jack Begley wants to eliminate the possibility that we'd think about anything <i>else</i>. Torquing and choking his strings, he wrings out an insistent <i>neener-neener</i> that uncannily mimics the drill's blank, skull-boring insistence. The song isn't much more than a minute, but it lingers uncomfortably, a leering face caught in a crowd.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29683-yuppies/"" target=""_blank"">Yuppies</a>, an Omaha band whose members graduated from high school in 2007, are really good at generating bad feelings. Their terrific full-length, a mixture of no wave anarchy, post-punk lockstep, and the way the two wrestle with and interrupt each other, explores a range of them. The band is signed to Dull Tools, the label run by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"" target=""_blank"">Parquet Courts</a>' Andrew Savage, and there are similarities: Begley mutters and shouts with the same dyspeptic unease. But the shit-eating grin is still always visible in Parquet Courts, where Yuppies mostly make me think of someone's overly tense neck muscles. ""All right, all right, we're going for a ride, whether you like it or not,"" Begley tells you in ""A Ride"". Then, when the doors lock, he turns to you and shrieks, forcefully.</p>
<p><i>Yuppies</i> is a tight, white-knuckled, and genuinely unpredictable record. The band recorded the entire first half of it in one long live take, and the nerviness of the endeavor is palpable. Songs don't start or end, they just roll right over each other, thrashing like fevered limbs in sweaty bedsheets. ""Across the Prairies"", the queasy, slow-moving intro, lurches into a frantic little ""Lust For Life"" tarantella in ""A Ride"" before colliding into a squealing wall of free-jazz saxophone that skids immediately into ""What's That?"". ""Easy Nights"" seems to interrupt itself and settle back down every 13 seconds or so. If you are accustomed to listening to Wire albums as one long, glowering run-on sentence, never bothering to confirm the title of the minute-long scrap you're currently hearing, than you'll probably settle into the rhythm of <i>Yuppies</i> quickly.</p>
<p>""I'm beginning to feel detached and a bit unstable, I just seem to get awfully mindful/ I swallowed an anchor the other day and almost drowned in the bathtub,"" the Yuppies' other vocalist Noah Sterba gulps on ""I Don't Know"". His black-comedic monologuing is tremendously satisfying to shout along to: ""LIVE A LIFE OF EXCESS!"" he screeches on ""What's That?"", and his voice scrapes a note somewhere just south of ""Scentless Apprentice""'s ""Go away-EEEE!"" The band fires off an appropriate sardonic little gesture for each lyric, like the curdled little cabaret riff, matched by a honking harmonica in unison, on ""Right Now"", or the violin sawing rustily, right on top of the bridge for maximum-scrunch, on ""I Don't Know"". The peak of the drama, and the longest sustained major-key stretch, dawns right when Begley realizes that ""Not every word has to rhyme/ Not everything has to be in time."" It's a brief, exultant moment of before the band acts on the manifesto and descends again, joyfully, into chaos. </p></div>"|18535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18535-yuppies-yuppies/|7.4|Jayson Greene

In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9211-nicolas-jaar/"">our interview</a> from earlier this year, Jaar wanted to shed his past reputation, and that’s fair enough. Who doesn’t hope to be seen as a different person at 23 than they were at 21? But that's the kind of C.V. you only play down if you're worried about being called an elitist or running for public office. That might not be so far off the mark in regards to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30070-darkside"">Darkside</a>, Jaar’s partnership with guitarist Dave Harrington. The name alone triggers an automatic word association with an album owned by over 50 million people and recognized by nearly everyone who’s made it to 10th grade. The prismatic, black-lit aura of their fascinating, endlessly explorable debut <i>Psychic </i>doesn’t try to stop anyone from making that connection and if you spot Jaar’s stated influences of Can and Richie Hawtin, that’s fine too: rarely has a record held such appeal for the high-minded while welcoming the simply <i>high-minded</i>.</p>
<p>Though a logical extension of the prog-dance fusion explored on Darkside’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16116-darkside-ep/"">self-titled EP</a> from 2011, it makes their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18243-daftside-random-access-memories-memories"">curious reimagination</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a> from a few months back feel like their true debut. Upon initially hearing it, one could easily think of Daftside as an academic work rather than something meant for listening pleasure—a foment of the bubbling resentment towards the original’s Gatsby-esque confluence of ostentatious extravagance and genuine, if self-serving, benevolence; it was a hell of a party that left a lot of up-and-coming producers feeling like they were locked out of East Egg. However, <i>Psychic </i>and Daftside have the same essential goal, guided equally by artistic reverence and crackpot scheming. And that aim is to emulsify the disparate record industry obsessions that dominated right before the advent of the compact disc: opulent disco and ornate prog-rock, yacht-pop and astral funk, the former of each almost exclusively singles mediums, the latter beholden to the LP and all sounding like the sole province of bearded, flamboyantly lapelled millionaires.</p>
<p>On the gargantuan opening gambit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15932-darkside-golden-arrow/"">“Golden Arrow”</a>, Darkside spend 11 minutes misremembering the ground rules for music neither of them were alive to hear the first time around. The heartbeat pulse serving a baseline for those distant, whirring synthesizers and hollowed-out drones is pure space-rock, but the gorgeous overlay of sighing cello and digital disintegration is not. When the beat finally drops after about four minutes, it’s a slack and stumbling disco interloper—high on pot, not blow. Those palm-muted funk guitars have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18134-after-dark-2""><i>After Dark</i></a> bloodshot tincture, but that label would never allow this much modernist, bit-crushing babble in their proudly purist Italo, let alone that undulating synth bass. And then, Harrington’s falsetto takes off like an apparitional Gibb brother and...are we <i>sure</i> this isn’t disco? Do these guys have <i>any</i> clue what they’re doing?</p>
<p>Thankfully, the answer is “hell no”—they have a plan, but no ground rules or precedents; Darkside aren’t <i>recreating</i> anything. The subliminal bass shadowing Jaar’s vocals on the confounding, starched-shirt blues of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16066-darkside-paper-trails/"">“Paper Trails”</a> has its own gravitational pull, it only exists in music made by Nico Jaar. Nor is there a session player capable of conjuring the panglobal percussion that morphs throughout “The Only Shrine I’ve Seen”, the impossibly lush layering of cymbals, snares, bells, and claps joining the hands of church choirs, marching bands, and Buddhist monks. Even Harrington’s rudimentary, blues box guitar soloing gives <i>Psychic</i> crucial, humanist grounding—those slowhand Dire Straits leads are the last thing you’d expect a forward-thinking electronic musician to incorporate into their mission statement, but amongst all the retro-futurist discovery, it’s the sound of <i>rediscovery</i>, similar to the reclamation of saxophones on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"">Destroyer</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt"">Kaputt</a>  </i>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver"">Bon Iver</a>'s electric-piano vindication of ""Beth/Rest.""</p>
<p><i>Psychic</i> is rife with extraterrestrial atmosphere and alien texture, but it never strays into pure ambience. Bust out the beanbag chair if you want, but in a record that fits an incredible amount of music into a compact 45 minutes, the silences are moments of active listening, too. “Sitra” initially registers as a necessary comedown from the stern demands of “Golden Arrow” until it pans completely in the left stereo channel. Darkside anticipate the very moment right before the disorientation of the unbalanced mix would be unnecessarily confrontational and drop you right into “Heart”, a traipse down the yellow brick road set to unsettling tribal drums. And just when you think it's getting kind personal on its one narrative (“Paper Trails”), the album drifts off into staticky calm.</p>
<p>That tranquil moment gets blown open thirty seconds later by ""The Only Shrine I've Seen"" and that’s just the first half of <i>Psychic</i> coming to a close. Side B only gets weirder as it hews more closely to Jaar’s associations with proper dance music. Up to this point, “space disco” typically meant one thing—airy, pretty, generally envisioning a brighter, cleaner future. “The Only Shrine I’ve Seen” and “Freak, Go Home” imagine what dance music could spring up from our future lunar cities if they’re every bit the dense, intimidating, metal monstrosities they are here on earth, teeming with both life and decay, flesh and rust. The most innovative and intriguing sounds on <i>Psychic</i> are almost entirely dedicated to its rhythm section—panned tambourines whizzing through “Paper Trails”, gooey snares on the hot-buttered closer “Metatron”, “Freak, Go Home”’s constant fluidity between acoustic and digital percussion. Though <i>Psychic </i>is the kind of immense and immersive experience typically described as “monolithic”, Jaar and Harrington ensure it’s more like the bubble gracing its cover—translucent and dense, electrified and organic, holding a form while constantly being prodded into new shapes.</p>
<p>When a record spends this much time reveling in pure sound, it’s understandable to ask, “Where’s the humanity?” The most instantly memorable lyric comes on “Paper Trails”, when Jaar intones “I want a house to live in/ Baby to take care of,” though in that voice of his, you never expect him to mean <i>exactly </i>what he says. <i>Psychic</i> doesn’t talk a whole lot about its feelings; true to its title, it’s not looking for a heart-to-heart so much as a telepathic exchange. And in trying to read Jaar and Harrington’s minds, you might think a little differently about things you already know, which can be just as important as being <i>moved</i>. Though the psychedelic density and classic rock touchstones of <i>Psychic</i> are ostensibly a negation of Jaar’s breakthrough, the quizzical, minimalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise""><i>Space Is Only Noise</i></a>, reconsider his intimidating biography and all of a sudden, Darkside makes a ton of sense, establishing connections between listeners and genres rather than pronouncing differences—people <i>dance</i> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4504-villalobos"">Ricardo Villalobos</a>, start record labels because they want to make music with their friends and, yes, Ivy League kids like to get stoned and listen to Pink Floyd. At least for the duration of <i>Psychic</i>, everything under the sun is in tune.</p></div>"|18586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18586-darkside-psychic/|9.0|Ian Cohen

Conventional wisdom suggests that the passage of time—and the day jobs, marriages, and diaper changes that often go with it—will inevitably erode the youthful abandon and creative frisson that fuels inspiration, not to mention the aging musician’s physical ability to retain their chops. But since reforming five years ago after a decade of inaction, Chapel Hill indie-rock linchpins <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3358-polvo/"" target=""_blank"">Polvo</a> have been getting down to the business of blowing such theories out of the water. Their wholly impressive 2009 comeback effort, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13398-in-prism/"" target=""_blank""><i>In Prism</i></a>, instead proffered the notion that, when removed from the load-in/load-out drudgery of perpetual van tours, artists are able to reflect, refine, and re-energize—and come out the other side a stronger, more confident, and more intuitive band than ever before. The band’s second post-reformation record, <i>Siberia</i>, drives the point home even further.</p>
<p>Polvo’s improved prowess can be felt in literally the album’s opening seconds. Like a beaten-down lawnmower, the band’s early records needed a few tugs to rev up—think of the many false starts of “Thermal Treasure” on <i>Today’s Active Lifestyles</i>, or the molasses-drip intro of <i>Exploded Drawing</i>’s “Fast Canoe”—as if the band was untangling and reorganizing its intricate strategies in real time. By contrast, <i>Siberia</i>’s introductory salvo, “Total Immersion,” provides just that in an instant—it’s as if we’re joining the band in progress at the precise moment they locked into the song’s powerful riff during hour five of an all-night jam session, with all the sweat and humidity in the room shaken out through the barrelling, handclapped backbeat. But where art-rock forbears like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a>famously distilled their epic improvisation sessions into more manageable pieces, Polvo work the other way, revealing new melodies and motifs in train-like fashion; they’re constantly opening new doors to explore, but in a linear, structured fashion. The real triumph of Polvo’s second phase is how they’ve managed to become a more approachable band without losing their sense of adventure—they can still go from accessible to inscrutable and back in a single chord progression but the shifts feel fluid and predestined rather than spastic and impulsive. Their songs have come more sprawling, but their albums on the whole have become tighter and more focused and, in the case of the breezy but byzantine ""Blues Is Loss"", they have an uncanny knack for making a seven-minute song feel more like three.</p>
<p><i>Siberia</i> is very much a sister album to <i>In Prism</i>, adopting its predecessor’s eight-song, four-to-a-side composition and even its sequential trade-offs between hot-wired rockers and psychedelicized excursions. But within these set parameters, the band continually surprise—in the extended fadeout to spectacular centerpiece track “The Water Wheel” alone, there’s enough new passages introduced in 90 seconds to spawn another record. Just when you think “Total Immersion” is about to dissolve in a dub-fuzz quicksand, its central riff suddenly reemerges like a rescue team leading you back to safety; and just as you’ve adjusted your ears to the high-beam synths (!) that  drive the chorus of “Light, Raking"", you’re hit with a twinned, harmonic guitar solo straight out of the Brian May/Thin Lizzy playbook.</p>
<p>These subtle classic-rock quotes—like the “Tom Sawyer”-worthy arpeggio that underpins the tranquil “Changed”—serve to make Polvo’s complex guitarchitecture more inviting to the uninitiated, but what really makes Polvo 2.0 an especially enticing proposition is Ash Bowie and Dave Brylawski’s more emotionally revelatory approach to their vocals. Polvo’s 90s-era output didn’t necessarily shy away from pop melody, but you often had to cut through the band’s barbed-wire discord to get at it. <i>Siberia</i> puts the hooks—and lyrical ruminations on passion versus reason—further out front than even <i>In Prism</i>, to take full advantage of their ageless but increasingly expressive voices: the deceptively serene prog-folk reprieve “Old Maps"" acquires the spectral melancholy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a>, while the punchy power-pop of “Some Songs” will satisfy that rogue faction of first-album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"" target=""_blank"">Foo Fighters</a> fans who wish Dave Grohl would’ve continued down the winsome, jangly path of “Big Me” rather than cranking up the stadium-grunge ballast. Fifteen years ago, it would’ve been strange to be speak of Polvo in relation to such noted melody-makers, but at this stage in their career, crafting pop songs is as much an experiment for Polvo as piecing together multi-sectional avant-rock odysseys. And what makes <i>Siberia</i> so great is that it thoroughly succeeds on both counts—proving once again that, for Polvo, all those years out of the game are to be measured not in inspiration lost, but wisdom gained. </p></div>"|18576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18576-polvo-siberia/|8.3|Stuart Berman

Whether it's a clear picture is another thing entirely; his shift from underground rap production next big thing to muddled indie-pop singer-songwriter to studio-bound funkateer has done a lot to confuse any set-in-stone ideas of what the RJD2 sound was or is supposed to be. His partnership with Aaron Livingston as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29842-icebird/"" target=""_blank"">Icebird</a> seemed like a good first step towards a reconciliation of everything RJ had built up in his portfolio over the previous ten years or so. But it also opened the door for a big “now what?"" and the hesitant anticipation of future work that could build on the idea of an all-encompassing, canonical RJD2 musical identity.</p>
<p>And now, for what feels like the first time in his career, RJ has released an album that comes across as a successful culmination of all his previous ideas and experiments rather than simply a new shift in style.. The title of <i>More Is Than Isn't </i>says as much; these are established trademarks and tics—bombastic drum breaks, sunshine-gleam brass, an armada of mothership synthesizers—that definitely sound like they came from the same hands that <i>Deadringer</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6798-since-we-last-spoke/"" target=""_blank""><i>Since We Last Spoke </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13801-the-colossus/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Colossus </i></a>did. But it's that first album's boom-bap crate-digging, its follow-up's prog-funk ambition, and his most recent album's cartoon neo-soul all streamlined into an overarching sound, with all the Pavlov triggers and odd quirks and over-the-top crests that combination implies.</p>
<p>With this album uniting everything that made RJ RJ over the years, it establishes a definitive place for him after all this time: that of the hip-hop-inflected neo-soul fusionist producer who is just as comfortable working in moods as genres. With his instrumentals, it's as though he's working more in potential-soundtrack mode than anything; it's easier to describe his beats nowadays for what montages or scenes they could evoke rather than where their component parts could place them demographically. You can definitely dance to a lot of it: the Isley-flecked groove of “Behold, Numbers!” extends this summer's disco-funk revivalism into early fall, “Winter Isn't Coming” goes all neon-space-pyramid with high-BPM footwork-jostling bongo breaks, and the Rick Rubin-oid, Mellotron/piano/space-laser breakdown showcase “Her Majesty's Socialist Request” has already proven <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_li_oIKDcgU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">through its video</a> to be a killer b-boy/b-girl anthem.</p>
<p>The vocal cuts are both a bit less frequent and a fair amount stronger than in his last couple records. There are a couple strong rap tracks, with emerging Columbus art-rapper P. Blackk rolling out fluid doubletime boasts over the Southern bounce-style “Bathwater” and old Soul Position partner Blueprint harnessing some of that vintage “Final Frontier” smoothness into nimble heist-metaphor storytelling for the Meters-go-caper-flick soul twang of “It All Came to Me in a Dream”. And while RJ does lend that hesitant falsetto of his to one of the tracks—the twee, contemplative “Dirty Hands,” where he actually fits well amongst the beatless chimes and strings—he largely leaves the vocals to R&amp;B singers who can do his heavy-breaks production justice, like Icebird collaborator Aaron Livingston (“Love and Go”) or Little Brother's Phonte Coleman (doing a more straightfaced—and affecting—version of his Percy Miracles loverman schtick on “Temperamental”). It peaks on “See You Leave,” a cut featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"" target=""_blank"">Roots</a>-affiliated rapper STS and singer/writer Khari Mateen, that's as buttery as it gets; on an album that fits right in with R&amp;B and hip-hop's free-for-all cross-genre fusion it's good to hear that RJ can build trad-soul beats with the best of them.</p>
<p>Still, as easy as it is to click with these songs as dance tracks or muso-appreciation fodder (RJ can still program and orchestrate a breakdown like nobody's business), it's better still to zone out and catch their sense of <i>mood</i>. While the vocal tracks are well-realized, this is the first album RJ's made in a long time that actually feels like it's satisfied to say most of what it has to say in instrumental form. His style-weaving, retro-contemporary instrumentation dislodges sounds from their own times and finds new modes for them. So when he rolls out burbling synthesizers that recall the early '90s heyday of ambient techno and 70s prog and glazes them over a class-of-'88 no-bullshit boom-bap break (“A Lot of Night Ahead of You”), or constructs a noir-jazz ballad that snaps from early Tom Waits tipsiness to uptempo Mayfield-style funk (“Got There, Sugar?”), all the parts fit together to turn a pastiche into something a bit less beholden to the sum of its parts. It's less about where the pieces come from than what they're evoking. And even if it's made clear by the conceptual thread that ties the album together—a three-part suite that leads off the album, appears at the halfway mark, and concludes it with three emotively varying takes on the same melodic theme—the fact that the whole of <i>More Is Than Isn't </i>evokes so many different well-built moods is testament to how much he's been able to elaborate on what he's capable of.</p></div>"|18596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18596-rjd2-more-is-than-isnt/|7.7|Nate Patrin

The drums build from a tribal romp to a panicked bubbling, rife with stealthy, undercover bass—the kind that unintentionally nods to a techno-master’s version of footwork. Jonny Pierce of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28199-the-drums/"" target=""_blank"">the Drums</a> swoops in to set the scene for a distant dystopian landscape, crooning with a combination of innocent yearning and pop-worthy sentimentality. That pop sensibility is solidified once a wave of dubstep bolsters his hook: “We gotta leave before we dieeeee.” On the surface the song feels like a relatively natural progression after Trentemøller’s 2010 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14306-into-the-great-wide-yonder/"" target=""_blank""><i>Into The Great Wide Yonder</i></a>, an album that benefited from these types of wide-reaching cinematics. Whether Trentemøller’s newest album’s successes are indeed its songwriting is another matter.</p>
<p>The fact that more than half of the songs on <i>Lost</i> carry guest vocalists is surely a sign of something. Or, at the least, that this producer is looking to test the boundaries of his abilities in the indie-pop/rock sphere. Sometimes his knack for blending minimal techno and house works towards that, sounding both progressive and true-to-self. Other times, the DJ's innovation is lost in the mix. Take “Gravity”, an opening track which features Jana Hunter of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28880-lower-dens/"" target=""_blank"">Lower Dens</a>. The song carries Trentemøller signifiers—a ping-ponging, bleepy synth pattern and minimal, plodding bass—but add Hunter and the singer’s haunting moans are immediately lifted into a swirl of psychedelic grooves. An enveloping of strings and a somber horn ballad sweep the track into becoming something that’s dictated by Hunter’s presence; “Gravity” is a perfectly fine Lower Dens track.</p>
<p>“Come Undone” features Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead and the producer’s role similarly becomes second-string to his singer. Perhaps it’s the distinct way Makino bends her melodies into syrupy moans, but “Come Undone”'s slow burn sounds like something that could have come from a futuristic, alt-universe issue of <i>Misery Is A Butterfly</i>. But then there’s “Deceive”, featuring the Raveonettes' Sune Rose Wagner, where we see Trentemøller's behind-the-scene skills stretched to their greatness. What begins as an exercise in the dark techno he's especially great at becomes much more. A feverish, unhinged synth buzz resonates as the speed picks up, making Wagner’s whispers of treacherous love sound increasingly harrowing in the process—all the while, “Deceive” ends up as one of <i>Lost</i>'s most danceable tracks.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the straight instrumentals on <i>Lost</i> are where Trentemøller ’s technical prowess is highlighted. As Philip Sherburne mentioned in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9500-the-last-resort/"">his review of <i>The Last Resort</i></a>, this is a man who “deftly fuses minimal techno, big-room house, and the itchy-scratchy fidgeting of IDM without sounding tokenistic.” Here the DJ stays true to this idea while leaping into other universes altogether. “Trails” unfolds as a krautrock stomp where crashing chimes and furious guitars take cues from Indian folk before hopscotching into a spacey laser-light show. (It's too bad he didn't pull Hunter onto something like this.) “Constantinople” jumps on a similar ship: a shrill accordion melody sampled from old Bollywood cruises through a bombardment of electric guitar and driving drums. Add the bass and the whole thing plays out like his own version of a wild jam session in a Turkish nightclub.</p>
<p>It's worth noting ""Never Stop Running"" was released on vinyl, its B-side featuring the instrumental track of the song. Listening to it stripped of its vocals, there's no doubting that the clever structuring of epic dance-floor blends is one of Trentemøller's greatest strengths. ""Still On Fire"", for example, is a simply-presented industrial escapade with grunting reverb, gloomy singing synths, and the tinkling of a million percussive embellishments—yet it still manages to deliver an emotive punch. The question for the producer going forward is whether any of these strong, statement instrumentals are more restricted by or benefit from collaborative effort. Because sometimes he's better off dancing on his own.</p></div>"|18530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18530-trentemller-lost/|6.4|Puja Patel

That hasn’t always been the case for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22059-roy-harper/"" target=""_blank"">Roy Harper</a>. In some ways he’s been the invisible glue that’s held together generations of singer-songwriters, a one-man secret history of progressive folk-rock underscoring the continuum that stretches from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4970-bert-jansch/"" target=""_blank"">Bert Jansch</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a>. In other ways, he’s been overshadowed by those who love him most. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/34939-echo-chamber-roy-harper/"">In 2009</a>, Harper lamented the fact that, by his accounting, he’d never been paid by Roger Waters for singing lead vocals on Pink Floyd’s 1975 hit “Have a Cigar”-- a song, ironically, that condemns the greed of the music industry. Harper had just pledged retirement from that industry, one that praised him far more than rewarded him. At the time, it had been nine years since he’d released an album, 2000’s <i>The Green Man</i>. If Harper were to be believed, it would be his last.</p>
<p>It’s now been thirteen years since <i>The Green Man</i>-- and that gap has been stopped by <i>Man and Myth</i>. Still, it feels like a stopgap. Harper explores no new territory, sonically or thematically, on the disc’s seven songs; if anything, it’s a stately retreat into the 72-year-old’s well-trod sound. As always, his voice is alternately dream-shrouded and strident, and his fingerpicking remains fluid and supple. On “The Enemy” and “January Man"", his acoustic serves as a shadowy, impressionistic backdrop as he ruminates on the past, both fictionally and confessionally. “The Enemy” dwells with melancholy sentiment on the faded specter of post-World Word II romanticism; “January Man” goes gingerly for its own jugular with unguarded pathos: “Time fell away/ Licking my wounds/ A lifetime astray,” Harper keens, allowing his nostalgic narrative to crumble into fractured syntax.</p>
<p>Those cracks grow too wide on “Time Is Temporary"". The song’s overbearing wordplay can’t overcome a pedestrian, at times corny talking blues. “A vision of purity / In an old Pre-Raphaelite dream” Harper pines, but his anachronistic overlay of 19th century aesthetics and 20th century Americana is more of a muddle than mystery. “The Stranger” fares far better. Celtic-accented and breathtakingly dynamic, it’s a dark yet lilting ballad that erupts in bursts of revelation and suspense. Harper’s obsession with myth is given a suitably epic treatment on “Heaven Is Here"", a 15-minute odyssey that recalls his 1971 masterpiece <i>Stormcock </i>in its richness and scope. What begins as a simple recounting of the tale of Jason and the Argonauts morphs slowly, across a mist of crystalline strumming and elliptical verse, into a deep gaze into Harper’s own mirror. “O how do I/ Retrace my youth/ From present lie/ To former truth,” he sings. As cheeky and clever as Harper can be, it doesn’t seem like meta-commentary on his own body of work; rather, it’s a study in the gray area between myth and mythopoeia that imagines a prog-folk Joseph Campbell.</p>
<p>The steady cadence of <i>Man and Myth</i> is most strikingly broken up by “Cloud Cuckooland"". Harper trots out one of the most overworked metaphors in Western culture, but he aims it at a fresh target: fame. Unfortunately, it’s not aimed well. Despite a bombastic assist from Pete Townshend, who unleashes an inspired burst of riffage, “Cloud Cuckooland” paints the post-millennium as a little more than a place where “The punters gather at primetime/ On the flat screens of their dreams/ To vote for dumb celebrity.” Harper dresses up the rest of his rant in pretty language-- including a shout-out to one of his closest contemporaries, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>: “The great shampooed are stranded/ With the cowgirls in the sand”-- but it’s still a rant. Existing in the fissures between stardom and obscurity, between myth and man, Harper has never been either. <i>Man and Myth </i>won’t change that.</p></div>"|18524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18524-roy-harper-man-and-myth/|7.0|Jason Heller

Creating a unique identity is difficult, and sometimes breaking out of it once it's been established is even harder. Daniel Lopatin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> is an artist working at one end of this spectrum. He’s restless, searching for new terrain, and his more recent full-lengths have found him reinventing himself with each new record. <i>R Plus Seven</i>, the follow-up to 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16031-replica/"" target=""_blank""><i>Replica</i></a>, sounds little like previous OPN releases. But despite the radical shifts—and this is what makes this project so consistently rewarding—you can still hear <i>him</i> in it; there are bedrock approaches and clear musical values that you can pick out as Lopatin. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The general approach on <i>R Plus Seven</i> is to build new music using the bright yet cold textures of the early age of personal computing. The aesthetic is identifiably “80s,” but it’s not the 80s of new wave, with its familiar array of synthesizers. Instead, Lopatin focuses on the hauntingly clean and clear pre-set sounds that were available for early, crude digital music production (and which were often used in commercial applications, from bumpers for local PBS shows to soundtracking instructional videos) and adds the kind of short-burst bits of information that were common when a sampler could hold two or three seconds of 8-bit audio. While this sort of throwback is common in electronic music, for Lopatin it serves a purpose beyond reference. <i>R Plus Seven</i> is aware of how music and textures like this are likely to be received, but it plays with our collective unconscious of music technology to develop something that comes off as strange and otherworldly and, most importantly, rich with feeling, despite the icy surface layer. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There’s a weird kind of innocence in this sound palette. The fake horns and whooshing vocal samples evoke a time when “the computer” as a concept was still very much rooted in the future rather than the present. The chintzy approximations of common instruments contain a sort of implicit critique of the idea that technology will save us all, but Lopatin’s music doesn’t get hung up on irony, even though it's definitely in the mix. It’s this quality, of highlighting the vacuous side of this music while simultaneously embracing its humor and poignancy, that elevates the OPN project to another plane. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Along those lines, during my first few listens to <i>R Plus Seven</i>, it was hard not to think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"" target=""_blank"">James Ferraro</a>’s recent work in this area, specifically his album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15992-james-ferraro-far-side-virtual/"" target=""_blank""><i>Far Side Virtual</i></a>, which used the impossibly cheerful and polished sound of early digital culture to emphasize the music’s connection to mindless, friction-free commerce. To Ferraro’s credit, he’s kept a poker face when presenting this music, and you never quite knew where he was coming from, which made the listening experience fraught with ambiguity and anxiety. But Lopatin comes at it from another angle. He wants his music to do things that music is traditionally known to do: change, develop, use melody to convey feelings, build tension and then release it. That all of this happens within such tightly controlled parameters makes the fact that the record is emotionally engaging that much more impressive. Common sonic threads include wispy digitized voices on tracks like “Americans” and “Chrome Country” that bring to mind the then-exotic turn-of-the-80s sound of the Fairlight synthesizer, an early sampling device, along with many brittle digital versions of sounds that are distantly “exotic,” conveying the feel of a blocky pixilated representation of a jungle or beach scenes.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Indeed, with “Americans” and “Inside World”, the album makes sharp use of contrasts between the real and the virtual, between “natural” and the representation of natural. I’m tempted to call it Fifth World Music in homage to the 1980 John Hassel/Brian Eno album <i>Fourth World: Possible Musics</i>, a record that has a clear spiritual connection to this one. Hassel and Eno hoped to filter ancient tribal sounds through the sound of technology to create an alien but distantly familiar landscape (their project generated discussion about clumsy wording and potentially problematic ideas of what constituted “primitive” music, but that’s a subject for another time). Lopatin grapples with some of those ideas of decontextualization and colliding worlds, but the meeting place is closer to a tableau from <i>Second Life</i>, providing another layer of disorientation. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, I can’t underscore strongly enough that, as with <i>Replica</i>, all of this takes place in a realm where musicality is paramount. You don’t listen to this record thinking about theory; it’s beautiful stuff, with chords and tunes and sections you remember. And it also draws from more sounds and eras than I’ve given it credit for. Opening track “Boring Angel” seems a tribute to the glorious repetition of Terry Riley’s process music, while “Along” and “Cryo” are closer to the mood and structure of that place where late-90s IDM sounds met the winding structures of post-rock. <i>R Plus Seven</i> doesn’t have quite the disembodied weirdness of <i>Replica</i>, but it’s no less accomplished, another intriguing chapter from an artist whose work remains alive with possibility. </p></div>"|18537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18537-oneohtrix-point-never-r-plus-seven/|8.4|Mark Richardson

Lead singer Jeremy Bolm’s got a lot on his mind-- He’s concerned about what his third album will mean for his legacy as an artist and whether he’s focused too much on what he <i>does</i> rather than who he is. He sees the replication of his father’s shortcomings in his current relationships, but realizes his old man did the best he could. Fake friends are forgiven and then quickly forgotten as Bolm starts to like who he’s becoming. Or, in short, Touché Amoré started from the bottom and the whole team’s fuckin’ here on the superlative <i>Is Survived By</i>, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31541-balance-and-composure"">Balance &amp; Composure</a>’s Jon Simmons, Andy Hull of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5579-manchester-orchestra"">Manchester Orchestra</a> and revered indie producer Brad Wood.</p>
<p>Granted, it’s unlikely that <i>Is Survived By</i> will divert the attention of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake"">Drake</a> listeners this week even if they’d find plenty of thematic similarities. But it’s not impossible and Touché Amoré appear keenly aware that <i>Is Survived By</i> has them poised to reach beyond a fanbase that can be described as “hardcore” one way or the other. For the most part, Bolm is trying to maintain some sort of grace while kinda freaking out about the situation-- “you can call this coming clean or a repeat of what you know/ about the struggles I once had as I’m learning to let go”, goes the frantic introduction of “To Write Content.” He tips his hand with the mere title of “Social Caterpillar” and assures the listener, “don’t worry I still get dizzy in the usual situations.” Sure, he was still pulling hours at a Burbank record shop this year, but as the frontman for an intensely loved and meaningful punk band, he gets put in a lot of unusual situations for the typical guy.</p>
<p>For example, the one he encounters on opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15785-touche-amore-just-exist/"">“Just Exist”</a>, where someone inquires how he’d “like to be remembered”, the sort of question typically asked of, say, Drake. His answer becomes the sole joke on an album of almost superhuman sobriety-- “I simply smiled and said ‘I’d rather stay forever.’” By the song’s end, he figures out the trick is in the title (“you’ll never know much of the truth/so I’ll just exist”) and as insular as Bolm’s concerns may be, Touché Amoré veer towards accessibility in all aspects on <i>Is Survived By</i>.</p>
<p>Bolm still maintains the same jagged wail that got Touché Amoré (not wrongfully) tagged as “screamo” at the outset-- all grit and serration, no affectation-- and the band provides plenty of max-chaos-per-second supercolliders in the form of “DNA” and “Blue Angel"". Only this time, they’re placed in the context of these funny things called “songs.” Some of them run up to three whole minutes and beyond, some are slow and even <i>pretty</i> in a twinkly emo kind of way (“To Write Content”, “Non Fiction”), some are love songs and all of them are produced with clarity and precision by a guy whose big credits are for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair"">Liz Phair</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins"">Smashing Pumpkins</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3986-sunny-day-real-estate"">Sunny Day Real Estate</a> records that are older than a lot of the kids I see at Touché Amoré shows.  </p>
<p><i>Is Survived By</i> is about 50% longer than any other Touché Amoré album and the quintet wisely instruct the listener how to pace themselves. The near a cappella “Praise/Love” and near post-rock instrumental “Non Fiction” would be remarkable for introducing variety alone; in the scheme of <i>Is Survived By</i>, they’re plot devices, introducing lyrical and musical motifs repeated immediately thereafter in “Anyone/Anything” and “Steps"". These tracks jolt the listener right back with choruses that go outside the scope of “melodic hardcore” into a bruised and spittle-flecked pop-punk that comes awfully close to radio-friendly, even if you’ll never hear it at <a href=""http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/touche_amore_refuse_to_play_warped_tour"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warped Tour</a>.</p>
<p>In essence, it’s an excellent band continuing to be excellent with more people paying attention. They haven’t lost sight of what got them here, however the band downplays their own virtuosity by emphasizing a studied recklessness, cranking out one anthemic riff after another, providing a familiar melodic framework that just skirts total recall. They serve as a setting for a frontman who barks out words that take the shape of narratives and conversations rather than poetry. In particular, “Harbor” and “To Write Content” are story-songs as well as cerebral exercises based upon the multiple (mis)readings of their titles. On the latter, Bolm meets Hull for the first time through mutual friends in New York and communes over a common concern shared by an LA punk band and a southern, grungy emo act-- can your personal happiness be an artistic liability?</p>
<p>There is a lot of “I” and “me” on <i>Is Survived By</i>, but it focuses on the social utility of the self, that a content person is more likely to make a positive difference. On the closing title track, Bolm implores the listener to “write a song that everyone can sing along to/ so when you’re gone, you can live on/they won’t forget you.” It’s easy to meet that statement with cynicism: surely, our society would be better off if fewer people believed they were a special little snowflake with a song that needs to be heard, right? But if you haven’t seen Touché Amoré live, you should, in part because it provides the proper visual-- the raw-throated, stone-faced man you hear on <i>Is Survived By</i> is liable to appear cleancut, constantly <i>smiling</i> even and he knows his band would be nothing without you. “Is Survived By” is pretty much an audio thank you note. The physicality of <i>Is Survived By</i> is more like a bear hug than an ass-kicking, wherein the passion can be scary at first, but it’s disarming, done out of love. They take this stuff seriously because <i>this</i>, <i>right here, matters. You matter</i>. And within these songs is the struggle in realizing that self-esteem comes more from estimable acts than outside validation. <i>Is Survived By</i> should receive plenty praise anyway, but Touché Amoré lead by example.</p>

That Maricich proclaims, ""We invented love"" on ""Make It Up"", the opening track of the project's new eponymous album, isn't entirely hyperbole; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/398-the-blow/"" target=""_blank"">the Blow</a>, comprised of Maricich and collaborator Jona Bechtolt of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5237-yacht/"" target=""_blank"">YACHT</a> from 2004 until the latter's exit and visual artist Melissa Dyne's entrance in 2007, have done their best to capture a certain, adorable shade of affection (see: the relative ubiquity of ""Parentheses""). At that moment—only seven years ago, but it feels like a generation in Blow time—the project proved itself a master of a petite, wittily articulate style almost all its own, establishing a four-years-in-the-making identity that, wherever or whenever you heard it, fastened itself to a piece of your life that you may or may not be inclined to revisit just yet.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Now, to meet 2013, the Blow might have traded Olympia's K Records for Brooklyn's Kanine, and Dyne is contributing songwriting and production in addition to her duties as the band's installation artist-in-residence, but they haven't stretched too much farther outside the world Maricich has been carving out for herself since splitting off from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2756-the-microphones/"">the Microphones</a> around the turn of the century. <i>The Blow</i> hopscotches through doubts and fears and mushy lovestuff much like its predecessors, rarely skipping boxes or treading out of bounds. Once again, Maricich's coy lyricism is littered with bite-sized, memorable quips. Her observations about gender (""He wants to talk to you 'cause you're a girl, and he likes girls/ We all like girls/ I flashed my powder-pink handgun and I walked right through""), oft-insecure self-reflection (""I heard a rumor that I was amazing/ I tell myself everything I hear about myself""), and the soullessness of dating without purpose (""A kiss was just something to do with my tongue until you kissed me"") are as beguiling as ever, fish-hooking an impatient ear back into a song so structurally simple and almost routine that, upon first listen, it could otherwise glide past as been-there, aughts-era synth twee with ease. Unsurprisingly, two of its shortest, pithiest songs—""I Tell Myself Everything"" and ""Like Girls""—are its shining moment. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Throughout, Dyne's instrumentation grooves close to the chest, beginning with the irresistible percussive bursts and adding a few embellishments, mostly toward the record's end: the synth-and-vocals stereo experimentation on ""The Specter"", the otherworldly echo that orbits ""Not Dead Yet""'s slow crawl. It's smart, carefully assembled commentary with a blithe score—a Blow record, in other words. Faced with a musical landscape that's increasingly ravenous for growth in leaps and bounds, the consistency after so long is refreshing, even if they make no attempt to remove themselves from their (and our) cute past.</p>
<p class=""p1"">At the same time, that steadfastness often reads as reluctance. Maricich seems aware of this. ""I will admit that I fear the future/ or I fear there won't be one at all,"" she sings on ""From the Future"". ""I can see the future beckoning with its dirty little finger/ When it calls to me, I will follow."" She hasn't—or perhaps it simply hasn't rung her yet. It's hard to tell whether staunchly sticking to the script is part of the performance or not; if it is, it does the album too few favors. It's too late in the game for that.</p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""http://www.khaelamaricich.com/queen-anne-thriftway/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In a recent blog post</a>, Maricich characterized her tween self as ""fairly brazen and painfully inhibited,"" something she says ultimately motivated her as a performer later in life; even after all this time, those are often <i>The Blow</i>'s qualities, too. Hesitation strings the album along a bit, loosening it so it rambles collectively, despite each song's precise individual character. ""Make It Up"" is a perfect reintroduction to the band's signature bop, and while ending on ""Not Dead Yet"" probably would've left a stronger impression than successor ""You're My Light"", they are a strong dual finale nonetheless. This, it seems, is where 2006 catches up with the Blow: Where these songs once demanded a whole lot of Northwestern indie-boom attention with their coy appraisals (both inward and outward), in today's context they tend to melt backwards, into the songs we already know. Dreamy respites are quite difficult to inhabit for long.</p></div>"|18585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18585-the-blow-the-blow/|7.2|Devon Maloney

For instance: They produced a video for the song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52248-video-quasi-see-you-on-mars/"">""See You on Mars""</a> to herald the release of this record, a clip which consists of a blizzard of vintage clips all stuck together with scant regard for coherence. Coomes and Weiss don't deal in reason, at least not in this guise. Weiss' work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3829-sleater-kinney/"">Sleater-Kinney</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29213-wild-flag/"">Wild Flag</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26519-stephen-malkmus-and-the-jicks/"">Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks</a>, plus their joint tenure as back-up band to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a>, provided a fairly comprehensible path to follow. Quasi are more turbulent in spirit, especially here on <i>Mole City</i>, a wayward, asymmetrical double album that sees them returning to the two-piece format after a period with Jicks bassist Joanna Bolme.</p>
<p>Something that remains from prior Quasi records is Coomes and Weiss' love of producing short, sweet pop songs smeared in lashings of distortion. Coomes sounds like he was born with a fuzz pedal permanently attached to his foot, ready to whitewash the world with it. That mode of operation is the core Quasi sound, the safe haven they build for themselves around all the idiosyncratic turns they take elsewhere. Coomes' familiar organ sound is often to the fore, sometimes leading him into barroom and honky-tonk directions. But they can just as easily dip into droney synth work (""Chrome Duck"", ""Loopy""), twee 90s indie on Weiss' vocal turn (""R.I.P.""), or, on one of the most affecting songs here, skirt around the kind of twilight blues found on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28214-chris-bell/"">Chris Bell</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13498-i-am-the-cosmos-deluxe-edition/""><i>I Am the Cosmos</i></a> (""Chumps of Chance"").</p>
<p>Quasi reek of the 70s, primarily through a love of power pop, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a>, and occasional moments of rock pomposity. The baroque beginnings of ""Headshrinker"" devolve into a burst of soloing of which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12927-queen/"">Queen</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24320-brian-may/"">Brian May</a> would be proud. There's never an overall sense of direction, or a feel Coomes and Weiss are looking to stretch across this record as its primary arc. Instead, <i>Mole City</i> resembles a jumble of all the thoughts and inclinations they've had since their last album, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13942-american-gong/""><i>American Gong</i></a>. It's a mess, but Quasi find virtue in clutter, turning it into their primary motive for existence as a band. Still, it's hard to digest over the course of 24 tracks, including a limp ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" pastiche (""Gnot""), a moment where Coomes seems to be channeling his inner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6284-wayne-coyne/"">Wayne Coyne</a> (""Geraldine""), and even a half-hearted found-sound collage on the title track.</p>
<p>The best song here is buried toward the end, at a point where the less patient listener may have given up altogether. ""An Ice Cube in the Sun"" radiates warmth and anger, with Coomes addressing ""the misfits of the world,"" Weiss pounding away at her kit, and a point where the whole song arches into a delirious stretch of low-key pop. It's followed by a one-minute ramble into country titled ""One &amp; Done""—easily one of the most throwaway moments here—which serves to highlight just how frustrating Quasi can be at times. But it's hard to fault them when that's the whole point, when making music becomes akin to opening up a drawer full of old clothes and trying them on just because you can. The fact that there's a track here titled ""Clap Trap"" is both indicative of their humor and uncomfortably close to being a useful descriptor for their work.</p></div>"|18573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18573-quasi-mole-city/|6.0|Nick Neyland

Singer Mark Thresher has said in <a href=""http://www.bowlegsmusic.com/features/interviews/forest-fire-interview-32605"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a> he feels entirely disconnected from the early Forest Fire material, and it shows. <i>Screens</i> boasts a new lineup, a new sound, and a new vision that exchanges homespun indie-folk for cascading synthesizers and prominent, jaunty bass lines. Gone is Thresher’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4548-the-walkmen/"" target=""_blank"">Walkmen</a>-like caterwauling; on <i>Screens</i> he whispers his electro-fuzz vocals in a way that’s more Mark Linkous than the Mark Thresher of old.</p>
<p>While <i>Screens</i> retains the lofty ambitions of <i>Staring at the X</i> (“Annie” is an 11-minute krautrock experiment), the omnipresent analog synth, delay effects, and other sonic consistencies unite the record’s tone and mood more than the chaotic sophomore release. <i>Screens</i> feels focused, confident. And thankfully Forest Fire’s evolution hasn’t undercut Thresher’s ability to write a taut pop song. In fact, before Thresher appears in “Alone with the Wires” and “Yellow Roses”, Stuart Murdoch could show up and start crooning about Dylan in the movies and it wouldn’t seem out of place. The melodies are pretty, lilting, and uncomplicated. </p>
<p>This new iteration of Forest Fire is heavy on electronics, but it’s rarely robotic. The repeating bass line on “Annie” could be a loop, though I’d wager Galen Bremer is playing it live. A few minutes in, the buoyant riff becomes an addictive, hypnotic drone as Thresher casually cuts in with observations about the song’s namesake that range from the wry (“They know your name in the restaurants of New York”) to cryptic (“There’s something written on your forehead”). After 11 minutes you still don’t get a complete picture of Annie, but Thresher seems more concerned with wrapping her mystery in metaphor. If all you walk away with is a vague but real sense of this woman’s magnetism, that’s perfectly fine.</p>
<p>According to the band, the screens of <i>Screens</i> refer to the real (the screen currently in front of your face) and metaphorical (between artist and audience). Forest Fire subtly illustrates this by constructing musical barriers; Thresher’s vocals are often positioned deeper in the mix, obfuscating his volume and clarity with translucent fuzz and decay. When he sings, “They listen but not very closely, and mostly they don’t,” on “Passengers,” it comes off like an invitation (or a dare?) to turn up the volume and lean in close. Once you take him up on the invite, Thresher’s couplets have staying power—no matter how recessed or processed or mysterious they appear. On “Alone with the Wires,” he asks, “How long between haircuts, and who’s gonna pay for lunch?” There’s no reason anyone should have an answer for such a mundane, rhetorical query, but good luck keeping that snippet out of the brain folds. </p>
<p>If “Annie” is the most avante-garde, “Waiting in the Night” is the most intimate and Luna-like of the bunch; oscillating synthesizer and gently jangling guitars create a muzzy, pre-dawn mood. It’s the pinnacle of Thresher’s songwriting to date. Still, just like <i>Staring at the X</i>, a couple tracks on the second half of <i>Screens</i> go too far off-message and lose their way. The wordless “Fixation” feels more listless than experimental, and when multi-instrumentalist Natalie Stormann shares lead vocals on “The Great Wall”, it’s jarring enough to disrupt the album’s continuity (though her background vocals are crucial to the dreamy vibe elsewhere). But for the most part Forest Fire employs their new vision to dizzying effect. Hitting the reset button isn’t always a graceful process for a band, but on <i>Screens</i> the reinvention sounds natural, like this is the band Forest Fire was supposed to be all along.</p></div>"|18554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18554-forest-fire-screens/|7.3|Joel Oliphint

Danny Brown has not failed at life—he's independently successful, with a fervent fan base both inside and out of rap. Now he's got to sort out how to best continue living. It might not be as dramatic a subject as flaming out, but it's more relatable to most of us, and it's maybe no accident that it resulted in the best and most resonant album of Brown's career. </p>
<p>In preparing critics and fans, Brown went to great lengths to warn us not to expect another <i>XXX—</i>""If people are just looking for dick-sucking jokes, there isn't too many of them,"" he said <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9047-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">back in January</a>. ""I listened to <i>Old</i> every day and thought, ‘I need to make this more entertaining,"" he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9223-danny-brown-top-underdog/"" target=""_blank"">told Pitchfork</a> later. When I ran into him at SXSW and introduced myself, he gave me a quizzical smile: ""I'm challenging ya'll with the next one,"" he joked, looking slightly uneasy. The irony of <i>Old</i>, of course, is that Danny Brown's version of a sober, measured, mature album still features plenty of lines about snorting crushed pills, throwing up in hotel sinks, and smoking so much kush you feel yourself falling off of the earth. Some things haven't changed. </p>
<p>The album is divided into a ""Side A"" and a ""Side B,"" an act of aesthetic devotion that signals Danny Brown's unusual investment in the arcana of music fandom. Last year, he famously told a bewildered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a> that one of his heroes was Arthur Lee before lecturing him on the merits of <i>Forever Changes. </i>The structure here suggests two LP sides, neatly divided, but one of the best things about <i>Old</i> is how mixed up it is—Brown's past, his present, his deranged side, his reflective side, his party songs and his nightmares. ""Problems in my past haunt my future and the present,"" he moans on ""Clean Up"". The album is 19 songs, ranging across so much emotional terrain that it almost needs to be tackled in stretches. </p>
<p>Side A contains the heaviest, most harrowing material, but the demons he exorcises there don't stay put. Bad memories pop up everywhere on <i>Old</i>, including the louder, more festival-ready second half. The album's structure pokes at the notion of forward motion: At the end of the first track, an unrelentingly ugly crack-sale reminiscence taking place in an abandoned house in Detroit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5254-a-trak/"" target=""_blank"">A-Trak</a> scratches in a hook from ""New Era"", a song off of Brown's 2010 release <i>The Hybrid</i>. An incident Brown alluded to on XXX's ""Fields""—""mommy gave me food stamps, told me buy some Wonderbread/ On the the way, these niggas jumped me, left with knots in my head""—gets expanded to song-length on ""Wonderbread"" and then referenced again at the end of the album. The cumulative message is layered: 1) Stop asking for the old Danny Brown, because I've been working double-time trying to escape him, and 2) Stop asking for the old Danny Brown, because he's obviously still here. </p>
<p>There are multiple ""old Danny Browns,"" as well: There's the kid from ""Torture"", whose mind ""ticked off, desensitized to a lot of things"" after watching ""unk beatin on my auntie"" and a fiend ""damn near burn his top lip off."" There's the crack-dealer, who Brown is similarly eager to dispense with: ""This the last time I'mma tell it/ Wanna hear it? Here it go,"" he says on ""Side B,"" before launching into the details of his old trade. And there's the drug abuser, whom he catalogs unsparingly on ""Clean Up"", ignoring text messages from his daughter while he gets high in a hotel room.</p>
<p>This is a complicated narrative to keep running but Brown is equal to the task. In his berserk originality, writerly flair, emotional impact, and old-fashioned craft, Danny Brown belongs in any conversation about the best rappers working, and he's at the top of his game here. His rapping is abrasive and visceral, but it's also musical, a quality he doesn't get much credit for because of his vocal tone. Listen to the way he rolls the word sounds ""fucked up"" and ""knuckles"" on ""Dubstep"" off of a perfect little woodpecker-stutter of percussion. Or his subdued performance on ""Lonely"" featuring a fluid, airy beat by Paul White built from two Morice Benin samples.</p>
<p>The production is richly textured, unlikely, and surprising, solidifying Brown's left-field taste. He bends your ear back rapping over conventionally gritty hip-hop tracks from Oh No and Paul White and tackles a range of things that most rappers would run from, including the Rustie-produced electro-squelch ""Way Up Here"", a cluttered, frantic beat that feels expressly designed to trip rappers up. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30353-ab-soul/"" target=""_blank"">Ab-Soul</a> and Brown muscle the octopus-armed thing to the ground. He barks over airhorn-shrill party anthems like ""Dip""and ""Handstand"" and broods conversationally on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a>-featuring ""Float On"". Brown has always made a compelling case for being weird, but he's never sounded this realized or confident in his weirdness before.</p>
<p>""Float On"", which closes the album, is an ""Elevators""-like lope, complete with woodblock knock, that finds Brown clearing away the static and bearing down on the only thing he's certain about: ""Nothing else matter except my next rhyme,"" he murmurs. Remembering a time when he had ""music in my heart, but my thoughts wouldn't listen,"" he prays to get old so that he can ""see my influence on this genre of music."" It's the humblest and most powerful wish I've heard on a record all year.</p></div>"|18565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18565-danny-brown-old/|8.7|Jayson Greene

But just like Steve Malkmus was mis-labeled the slacker king, Parquet Courts singer/guitarist Andrew Savage can sound like he’s murmuring lyrics from deep within a futon. Some of the first words you hear on their shining 2012 full-length debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17405-light-up-gold/"">Light Up Gold</a></i> are “</span><span>I didn't come here to dream or teach the world things/ Define paradigms, or curate no living days,” and here there’s a little speech bubble in the corner of the artwork for the new </span><i>Tally All The Things That You Broke</i><span> EP that says “Got damn it’s just a bootleg!”</span></p>
<p>But that excuse is scratched out in red marker, and instead, front and center, are five “Self-Evident Truths” taken from each of the five songs of the EP. Parquet Courts, if for only some brief minutes on this collection, actually spend some time caring about, you know, stuff. There’s even a song on here that nods to the subversive punk directives of bands like Minor Threat and Black Flag and is diametrically opposed to anything resembling a “slacker” anthem.</p>
<p>Released just over a year after <i>Light Up Gold</i><span>, the droll post-punk of the band's debut rolls onward for these five songs about heartbreak, rebellion, depression, and trying to deliver weed on a bike.</span> Levity remains Parquet Courts’ strongest suit, obviously. They’re the young wise fools of New York (by way of Texas), and their sound openly recalls all the frayed and wiry post-rock of the 80s and 90s, though their southern twang and sharp satire push them away from being revivalists. Savage’s delivery of the anxieties running through his mind is just as thrilling as the spidery guitars that run beside them. What separates him from his Gen-X forebears is that none of what he does feels typically cool at all—he has a way of masking honest songwriting in crooked wordplay and a joke about the munchies. At his most honed, he’s a two-bit philosopher on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16000-youve-got-me-wonderin-now/"" target=""_blank"">“You’ve Got Me Wonderin’ Now”</a>, suggesting that “Toothache’s better than heartache” and “Seasick’s better than heartsick,” but some heart-breaker has him second guessing his own platitudes.</p>
<p>The rhythm section is wound tight on the <i>Tally </i><span>EP, whether snapping against each other to get totally wired (“Descend (The Way)”) and stumbling into each other to get totally weird (“Fall On Yr Face”). Even when they stretch it out for five minutes on the shuffle-punk of “The More You Use It”, they stay focused. That's the song that hurls out a succession of anarcho-individualist platitudes (“Say something without the words they fed ya! Find something they didn’t tell you to hunt for!”), any one of which could be stenciled on a DIY zine. If you ever doubted that Parquet Courts gave shits, this is their exonerating testimony. Savage sends each line out to the back of the club every time, all underneath sugary post-punk revival guitar lines courtesy of Savage and his longtime associate Austin Brown.</span></p>
<p>All this leads to the finale, an ambling snooze-rap that sounds like a bunch of kids doing a loving but remarkably faded tribute to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys"" target=""_blank"">Beastie Boys</a>. The song trails a weed courier on his bike as he cruises through the streets of New York, seeing paths in all directions, walking up stoops in Union Square, and ringing hundreds of apartment buzzers. All’s well for our hero until he gets busted on Wilson Ave. in Bushwick by the 83rd Precinct. He’s left handcuffed in the gutter as Savage lets out the last of the “Self-evident Truths” Parquet Courts detail on the cover, “The powers that be choose to surveil the poor.” Unfortunately it drags meaninglessly on for three minutes against some dog-whistle guitar feedback—a sloppy way end an otherwise stellar EP. That ""jam"" at the end does, however, remind us that Parquet Courts are still just loveable ne’er-do-wells, content to be starlings of the sardonic slipstream just as much as they want to rise above. They don’t waste the involuted micro-analysis that comes with THC—the wan, specific observations about love and life—they actually use it.</p></div>"|18563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18563-parquet-courts-tally-all-the-things-that-you-broke-ep/|7.5|Jeremy D.

That's the message you get from the defiantly low-concept video for her single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Ymd-OCucs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tennis Court""</a>, in which the 16 year-old New Zealand singer-songwriter (real name: Ella Yelich-O'Connor) stares right at you—her taunting, onyx pupils burning a hole through the computer screen—for a hypnotic and somewhat uncomfortable three and a half minutes. (It's an anti-video in the tradition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"" target=""_blank"">the Replacements</a>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl9KQ1Mub6Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bastards of Young""</a>, and, fittingly, her moody cover of ""Swingin Party"" has been making the rounds.) In a moment when too many new artists seem afraid to offend or go off script, Lorde is an exciting contradiction: an aspiring pop star who's had a major-label development deal since age 12 (she was discovered at a local talent show) but has retained a seemingly genuine iconoclastic streak. The other day she spoke too truthfully in an interview and <a href=""http://popdust.com/2013/10/01/lorde-gets-her-first-major-pop-star-scandal-after-taylor-swift-diss/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">accidentally insulted Taylor Swift</a>; Katy Perry asked her to tour with her and—politely but firmly—<a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2013/09/lorde-didnt-want-to-tour-with-katy-perry.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she said no</a>. With the global smash ""Royals"" (the first song in 17 years by a female solo artist to top Billboard’s alternative chart) she made her name by sneering at everything else on the radio (""We don't care/ We aren't caught up in your love affair""). The message is clear: Lorde has introduced herself to the world as someone who gives very few fucks. Twenty seconds into her debut album,<i> Pure Heroine</i>, she's already announced that she's bored. <i>Twice</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lorde's voice occasionally takes the form of a wide-eyed, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"" target=""_blank"">Feist</a>-y coo, but much more often it's a low, clenched growl; like everything else about her, it has an air of ""wise beyond her years."" ""I didn't start writing songs until I was 13,"" she said in a recent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2y6H3MCqsk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, almost apologetically, but then quickly accounted for the lost time, ""Before that, I wrote short fiction."" Now that she's a wizened 16, Lorde, who wrote all the lyrics on <i>Pure Heroine</i> and co-wrote the music, has fashioned herself a correspondent on the front lines of elegantly wasted post-digital youth culture and working-class suburban boredom. Her songs capture the drama and debauched regality of being a teenager: their subjects include online gossip, empty bottles, queen bees, and young people who already feel old. ""I'm kinda older than I was when I rebelled without a care,"" she sings with a languid sigh on the bleacher-stomping single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16028-lorde-team/"" target=""_blank"">""Team""</a>. Or is she saying ""revelled""? It's hard to tell the two words apart, and maybe that's the point.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That carefully cultivated ambiguity is precisely what makes <i>Pure Heroine</i> work. ""Royals"" walks the line between rebelling against and reveling in the trappings of power, luxury, and excess of contemporary pop. The arrangement is economical—just a few finger snaps and a barely-there beat caught in the gravitational pull of Lorde's charisma—but overall, ""Royals"" gets to have it both ways. Lorde <a href=""http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/06/meet-lorde-the-teen-pop-star-with-no-selfies.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> she wrote it thinking of how she and her friends would listen to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a> rapping about couture while they rummaged through a particular friends' well-stocked kitchen, too broke (or too lazy) to spend money on dinner. And that’s a crucial subtlety: ""Royals"" doesn't critique hip-hop culture so much as express a disconnect that many of the people who love it (Lorde included: ""I've always listened to a lot of rap"") feel when listening to songs about luxury culture. Whether she's singing about her schoolyard peers or the world's most famous pop stars (who, as she admits on ""Tennis Court"", have just become her new peers) Lorde achieves a tricky balancing act of exposing irony and even hypocrisy without coming off as preachy or moralistic, simply because—thanks to <i>Pure Heroine</i>'s constant use of the royal ""we""—she's usually implicating herself in the very contradictions she's exposing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>More fully realized than her debut EP </span><i>The Love Club</i><span>, </span><i>Pure Heroine</i><span> is a fluid collection of throbbing, moody, menacingly anesthetized pop that sometimes sounds like<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank""> St. Vincent</a>’s ""Champagne Year"" mixed into whatever’s in the punch at Abel Tesfaye’s house. Still, a lot of its best production ideas and lyrical motifs repeat in such a way that it sometimes feels like you’re listening to 10 versions of the same song. Current single ""Team"" has a memorable chorus, but most of its lyrics (""I'm kinda over being told to throw my hands up in the air""; ""We live in cities you never see on screen/ Not very pretty but we sure know how to run things"") feel like scrapped lines from the ""Royals"" session. ""Glory and Gore"", too, rehashes the same bloody/regal/teen imagery, but its greater crime is the way Lorde overstuffs the verses with so many words that it weighs down the melody. And yet, there’s something endearing about </span><i>Pure Heroine</i><span>’s more unfiltered impulses—though she’s had a  record contract nearly a quarter of her life, you get the sense Lorde is still being given a lot of room to breathe and hone her own particular songwriting voice. These tracks all feel like they were written by a very precocious teenager, and that’s a big part of their charm.</span></p>
<p><i>Pure Heroine</i><span> is a decidedly post-internet album. Some of that has to do with its genre-agnostic blend of influences (in her live show Lorde has been covering both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a> and the Replacements, and her music is being marketed to a generation of people who in no way find that weird), but it’s mostly a comment on a certain kind of sensibility of self-presentation in the characters it deftly depicts. ""It’s a new art form, showing people how little we care,"" she boasts on ""Tennis Court""</span><span>. As the song goes on, though, cracks in the facade begin to show. ""We're so happy even when we're smiling out of fear,” she admits, but at least “it looks alright in the pictures.""</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid--9a07b92-79c0-9c80-2349-bf0e0fbe4ec7"">What’s fueling <i>Pure Heroine</i> is a tension between the tweet and the truth, the cumulative effect of the little digital fictions we craft for ourselves daily.</span><span id=""docs-internal-guid--9a07b92-79c0-9c80-2349-bf0e0fbe4ec7""> But ""Ribs"" is the best song that this very promising songwriter has written so far because—even at the risk of seeming uncool— it gradually allows the walls to crumble. ""It feels so crazy, getting old,"" she sighs at the beginning, in a smoky pantomime of maturity and detachment—sort of like a sepia-toned Instagram filter applied to her voice. Soon, though, the beat ramps up and the song turns into an impressionistic swirl of memories: ""The drink you spilled all over me/ 'Lover’s Spit' left on repeat."" She gets so caught up in the feeling that she lets herself blurt something truly vulnerable: ""I've never felt more alone/ It feels so scary, getting old."" Lorde’s music is quietly wise to a particular modern irony: Beneath every #DGAF there’s a person who secretly gives a fuck about <i>something</i>, and behind every anti-pop song there’s a singer who—just like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFeZr5ptV8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">everybody else</a>—knows what it’s like to feel happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time.</span></p></div>"|18614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18614-lorde-pure-heroine/|7.3|Lindsay Zoladz

The self-proclaimed can of Rocky Mountain Whoop Ass celebrated its 10th anniversary with a deluxe reissue of the band's 2003 debut, <i>Blitzen Trapper</i>, back in April and a month later, band multi-instrumentalist Marty Marquis released an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46618-listen-all-synthesizer-version-of-ty-segalls-goodbye-bread/"">all-synthesizer version</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/"">Goodbye Bread</a>, </i>a slant nod to Blitzen Trapper’s <a href=""http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-30252-extended_qa_eric_ear.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""American""</a> melting pot of genres as well as a homage to Wendy Carlos’ 1968 experiment <i>Switched-On Bach</i>. Now they’re back with something like a return to form in their seventh full-length—and first for new label Vagrant—simply titled <i>VII</i>. </p>
<p>Blitzen Trapper set a standard for much of their unpredictable course with both their debut and sophomore album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1153-field-rexx/""><i>Field Rexx</i></a>. The latter, in particular, is all over the place, ranging from 8-bit honky-tonk to 20-year-old recordings of Eric’s father, James, a bluegrass musician. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10292-wild-mountain-nation/""><i>Wild Mountain Nation</i></a> continued on that wildly inventive trajectory, emphasizing hair-metal freakouts (“Miss Spiritual Tramp”) and disjointed mindfucks (“Woof &amp; Warp of the Quiet Giant’s Hem”) over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">the Stooges</a>; but the the title track’s conversational guitars and easy beat is what signed the band to Sub Pop. At that point, all bets were off, even for them. Follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12345-furr/""><i>Furr</i></a>, arguably their most accessible effort to date, favored pedal steel and folksy harmonies; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14276-destroyer-of-the-void/""><i>Destroyer of the Void</i></a> indulged in prog-rock references to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12927-queen/"">Queen</a>; and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15825-american-goldwing/""><i>American Goldwing</i></a> was more or less a long haul down classic rock’s collective memory lane.</p>
<p>That leaves us at <i>VII</i>, which opens with suggestive, if routine, radio tuning static: Blitzen Trapper are finding their way back, as it turns out to somewhere between <i>Nation </i>and <i>Furr</i>. The harmonica bleats, walking bass line, and vivid imagery are familiar, but it’s still good to hear the band fire up their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a> stomp again. “[<i>VII</i>] has a certain hip-shaking funk to it,” Earley <a href=""http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jul/11/blitzen-trapper-celebrates-10-years/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said in an interview</a> over the summer, and Blitzen Trapper do seem to be having the most fun when they’re banging away on the clavinet in “Drive On Up.” Their frontman recruits gospel singer Liz Vice to reinforce his preacherly idioms—“There ain’t no tie like the tie that binds/ There ain’t no way like the way divine”, an allusion to Earley Senior, who <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR1kHMgKjNg&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">taught his son</a> the all-importance of “faith” and “playing stringed instruments”—on “Shine On"", again for a briefly soulful interlude on “Neck Tatts, Cadillacs” and elsewhere for backing vocals. It’s a nice change, but it's not nearly the same as Blitzen Trapper’s earlier innovation.</p>
<p>“Ever Loved Once” is catchy enough, with all the fixings for another “Wild Mountain Nation.” The rest of <i>VII</i> doesn’t live up to its potential. The most interesting ideas aren’t developed into anything more than ear-pricking novelty, which used to be almost all they did. A younger Blitzen Trapper would have taken these threads and ran with them. Maybe they’d wind up unraveling the damn thing, but at least they tried; more often than not they actually pulled it off. Now that they’re playing it safe, right down to the album title, there’s not much to dig into, much less plow through. Like the protagonist of “Furr"", they’ve forgone running with the wolves, and lost an awesome part of themselves in the process.</p></div>"|18572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18572-blitzen-trapper-vii/|6.7|Harley Brown

Sure, he's kept busy drumming for Sonny Smith (most recently on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18109-sonny-the-sunsets-antenna-to-the-afterworld/""><i>Antenna to the Afterworld</i></a>), but it makes sense why he'd take more time on a record than his peers might: Stoltz has made his name as a studio wizard. He <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7951-positive-destruction-san-franciscos-new-garage-rock/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">introduced several of his peers to the Tascam 388</a>. He's the guy John Dwyer called to lay down some harpsichord on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17866-thee-oh-sees-floating-coffin/"">Floating Coffin</a></i>. But his solo discography and stereotype as a studio hermit come with drawbacks. He's the sort of guy who can camouflage himself in the classics—the pastoral Anglophile leanings of Ray Davies, the harmonies of Brian Wilson, and so on. As an engineer, artist, and songwriter, Stoltz occasionally brings to mind Todd Rundgren on the A-side of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithful_(Todd_Rundgren_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Faithful</i></a>: a studio wizard talented enough to give the ""uncanny valley"" treatment to iconic songs.</p>
<p>That's one of the biggest obstacles inherent to Stoltz's discography—his work often feels like a pose, even if it's an adept one. That's still at play on <i>Double Exposure</i>. The album's title track has the pop robot delivery and immediacy of a Cars song, and while the hook is interesting, the track feels plastic and glossy. At times, it's hard to find or latch onto the exact personality at the core of the album. ""Are You My Love"" also feels somewhat faceless. The lyrics and melody are generic enough; just sub out Stoltz for Mark Knopfler or Steve Miller or a <i>Nuggets </i>band. He's the sort of guy who unironically sings about climbing off his trip, like he's just emerged from another time when phrases like that were commonplace.</p>
<p>But in the album's best moments, Stoltz goes from playing ""fossilized rock'n'roll artifact"" to revealing who he really is: an audiophile who pores over music, music-specific biographies, and liner notes. It's a very fine line between those two distinctions, but while the former is a rubber rock legend Halloween mask, the latter is an open admission from ""Stoltz as appreciator and student of music"". When he makes reference to work he loves, it feels conversational and familiar; in a way, it counterbalances the more sonically dated elements. His piano and bass work on ""Down by the Sea"" are an elated cribbing of the Zombies' <i>Odessey and Oracle</i>, but he sings about the girl he loves in idealistic terms a crate digger can understand. ""She was the girl from a young man's dream,"" he sings, ""A little bit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stevie</a>, little bit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_McVie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christine</a>/ She never cared about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter Green</a>."" Later, on ""It's Summertime Again"", he sings about how nobody wants to hear gloomy stuff like ""the Spaceman or the Sonic Boom"" now that it's nice outside.</p>
<p>And even when Stoltz is singing moon-eyed, pastoral songs that would've existed nicely on a Left Banke record, he can sell that material with his expertly crafted arrangements. ""Marcy"" is an easy album highlight—a classic entry in the ""girl's name as song title"" canon—with lyrics about falling in love hard, bicycle bells, and dead flowers. It's given a subtle build, starting off with an acoustic guitar solo, slowly building with synths, acid-washed vocals, and sturdy percussion. Soon, the track gets a well-placed and gorgeous guitar solo from Stoltz and Sonny Smith affiliate James Finch Jr. </p>
<p>""Marcy"" is the first in a run of the album's best songs. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15868-kelley-stoltz-kim-chee-taco-man/"">""Kim Chee Taco Man""</a> is psychedelically goofy, ""Down by the Sea"" is giddily loving, and both are entirely catchy. ""It's Summertime Again"", however, is the album's greatest achievement. The backing instrumentals—lilting piano, slightly off-key horns, tambourines–slowly and euphorically echo and bleed together while Stoltz's deep vocals are pushed out front. He packs in phrases that are perfectly suited to the song's smiling-but-dour, ""ice melting into summer"" atmosphere, like ""You're drinking yourself silly with a girl behind a veil"", or, ""I'm tired of these icicles, I'm in need of skin/ and the sound of 'Little Red Corvette' melting in the wind"". And he's a clever lyricist. The song's titular phrase is repeated throughout as a first-person observation, and to keep it from getting stale, he flips the context: ""I sit down to read an article by an author that begins: 'It's summertime again.'""</p>
<p>Those final four tracks are among the album's best, but sadly, that peak is preceded by a valley. ""Inside My Head"" and ""Still Feel"" are at the album's center, and collectively, comprise over 15 of the album's 42 minutes. There are some nice melodic inclinations in both songs, but they drag on for far too long. And that's ultimately what Stoltz brings to the table with <i>Double Exposure</i>—moments of pop greatness, but also overlong tracks and too-generic delivery.</p></div>"|18521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18521-kelley-stoltz-double-exposure/|6.8|Evan Minsker

Since the Swedish producer's debut LP as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a>, 2007's techno-pop landmark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10022-from-here-we-go-sublime/"" target=""_blank""><i>From Here We Go Sublime</i></a>, Willner has patiently augmented the project's sound with each successive release, adding subtle touches that are significant in scope and texture. He operates with a workmanlike consistency, putting out an album about every two years, each with nearly identical packaging—two lines of artfully scribbled text on a beige background. On his first three albums as the Field, this simple design reinforced the Field's overarching aesthetic congruency. Without even cracking the spine of <i>Cupid's Head</i>, his fourth, it's obvious change is afoot, and the visual shift feels significant. Compared to the glimmering, soft-hued soundscapes of 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15790-looping-state-of-mind/"" target=""_blank""><i>Looping State of Mind</i></a>, the new record is a moodier work, perfectly balancing sleekness and aggression.</p>
<p>Willner's recent solo performances have abandoned the body-moving tendencies of the Field's full-band shows, favoring drones and formlessness more associated with his Loops of Your Heart project. <i>Cupid's Head</i> is thick and dense, a miles-long oil slick that radiates ultraviolet hues, and it has some overlap with his other project. It also finds the Field occasionally coming full-circle, with qualities that recall <i>Here We Go Sublime</i>. Besides being Willner's strongest collection since that game-changing debut, <i>Cupid's Head</i>'s six lengthy jams take cues from <i>Sublime</i>'s centerpiece, ""The Deal"", an intimidating monolith of techno that swells and pulsates over its 10-minute running time. He's moved away from proper and his sense of scope is more epic than ever. <i>Cupid's Head</i> as a record just feels <i>bigger</i>, dwarfing his previous efforts.</p>
<p>In that sense, <i>Cupid's Head</i> brings to mind another texture-focused album from this year: Fuck Buttons' <i>Slow Focus</i>, which saw the Bristol noise duo reining in their noisy squall to focus on diamond-sharp textures and a greater attention towards small-scale detail. ""20 Seconds of Affection"", <i>Cupid's Head</i>'s gauzy closer, kicks things off with a throttling torrent of digital synth slush before giving way to a mid-tempo churn that continually folds itself into three-dimensional shapes, as a wandering bassline lurks just beneath the surface, wobbling with unease. ""Black Sea"" also has a feeling of up-up-up propulsion—hissing drum machines, interlocking tones, a swirl of transistor-radio noise lapping at the track's feet—before dramatically changing shape in its back half, as menacing arpeggiated tones dominate. The Field project has typically projected easy warmth, a kind of synthesized benevolence, but the intensity of ""Black Sea""'s closing minutes is the darkest, most straightforwardly sensual, and most <i>evil-sounding</i> music Willner's made.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Cupid's Head</i> is more intense than any other Field record. With the exception of the silvery guitar tones that open the album's epic opener, ""They Won't See Me"", these songs start at the top and stay there, eschewing patient build for pure relentlessness, a sonic persistence that obliterates everything around you in a comforting, head-clearing way.</p>
<p>There are many transcendent moments of bliss on <i>Cupid's Head—</i>""They Won't See Me""'s high-tension tonal axis, the squishy radiance of ""A Guided Tour""—but ""No. No…"" is the album's greatest moment of awe, with an endlessly looped voices evocative of the Flamingos-warping abstraction of <i>From Here We Go Sublime</i>'s title track. Each iteration of the title phrase gradually stretches it further into the void. Over a bed of stormy, amorphous rhythms and off-white static, the sampled voice changes shape—from high-pitched to low, staccato to elongated, specific to indefinable—until there's nothing left but a broken helicopter-blade beat and an unadorned vocal sample that vibrates with a menacing inflection. It's a wellspring of tension on an album that brims with paranoia.</p>
<p>The Field's discography is paradoxical. On the one hand, <i>Cupid's Head</i> demonstrates how much Willner's aesthetic has changed over the last six years. That those changes have been incremental, and that there are clear threads going back to his debut, highlight the singularity of what he does. The landscapes of dance and electronic music have shifted since the release of <i>From Here We Go Sublime</i>—minimal techno, as well as Willner's label home Kompakt, have become niché concerns—so the fact that he's still an innovator in an always-crowded field is a considerable feat. A few artists have taken bits and pieces of his style and applied them in their own way, but no one has been able to sound like Willner, who in turn continues to sound like no one except himself. <i>Cupid's Head</i> is a dark, exquisitely detailed album that rewards patience and further cements the Field's reputation as one of modern electronic music's most satisfying auteurs.</p></div>"|18538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18538-the-field-cupids-head/|8.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

His unapologetic enthusiasm for geek culture ephemera and that drawling, swooping </span><span>nyeah-nyeah </span><span>voice added a novel goofball edge to his frenzied agenda of intricate technical raps, hitting his outsized peak as the frontman of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/173-dan-the-automator/"" target=""_blank"">Dan the Automator</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2281-kid-koala/"" target=""_blank"">Kid Koala</a> supergroup that comprised </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1057-deltron-3030/"" target=""_blank""><span>Deltron 3030</span></a><span>. As the title character, Del took the super-scientifical-lyrical-miracle orthodoxy of underground hip-hop lyricism and pushed it to a caricature of its logical conclusion: a proggy sci-fi cyberpunk opus as dense and imposing as a skyline from Katsuhiro Otomo's </span><i>Akira</i><span>, if a fair amount goofier. Too silly to be pompous yet too grounded in reality to be escapist, Deltron warped fanboy obsessions into cutting sociopolitical satire and erased the line between funny-ha-ha and funny-weird in the process.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That was 13 years ago-- before hundreds of Nintendo-casualty rappers started recording nerdcore albums, before geek culture became the overculture, and before a sequel to </span><span>Deltron 3030 </span><span>was announced and delayed and pushed back and postponed to an extent that rivaled </span><i>Detox</i><span>. It's not one of those specific things that makes </span><i>Event II </i><span>feel a lot less worth celebrating, though it's likely that expectations have been twisted a bit by them. But like every other beloved property of the Comicon set that's been rebooted to be darker, grittier, and less kitschy in a self-inflated attempt at passing itself off as ""mature,"" </span><i>Event II </i><span>drains the Deltron concept of its anarchic post-apocalypse giddiness and goes all gloomy on us.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And that's a problem for a couple reasons. One of them is that the jargon-crammed narratives that drove Del's lyrics worked when there was a lighthearted spirit to them - not an ironic or half-assed one, but a context where William Gibson lingo and space-hacker Afrofuturism flowed as accessibly as his bars about weed and women did. That sense of playfulness keeps slipping out of Del's grasp for much of </span><i>Event II</i><span>, ratcheting up the corporate-ruined wasteland of </span><span>Deltron 3030</span><span>'s setting and abandoning his pranksterish rebel character voice for a grimmer messiah-ish figure. A Joseph Gordon-Levitt-narrated jump to the year 3040 on opening skit ""Stardate"" sets up ""The Return"", a lengthy rundown of everything that went to shit in the decade since 3030 saw Deltron Zero and Automator vanish. It's here that the first big tonal clashes start jumping out out, endless portrayals of dystopian desperation vaguely leavened with faint stabs at the punchlines of years gone by. After Deltron and his crew beat up a bunch of drugged-up wasteland punks who were threatening a woman, Del reassures her that the assailants have been tossed in a trash compactor and ""literally minced into little bits between/pieces of leftover Chef Boyardee/ mixed with a couple-a booty magazines."" Labored jokes are bad enough; it's even worse when they're the only punchline on an entire track.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>From there on out it's a disjointed thread of events that reveals the other big problem with this new approach to the Deltron story: it dives in with overcomplicated yet shopworn worldbuilding at the expense of relatable detail. Sure, there's references to the financial crisis and wealth gaps and the surveillance state, but it gets buried under technobabble and b-movie rhetoric that's incomprehensible when it's not cliche. (Would you believe that, in this blighted hellscape, the totalitarian government has gone so far as to </span><span>ban music</span><span>?) Deltron's distinct character gets buried along with it, too, as his ascendance from prodigal son with a scrappy band of followers to a resurgent ultrahero commanding massive guerilla armies to straight-up 41st century afterlife power is papered over with minutia. We get a lot of observations of what's going on-- confrontations with duplicitous money men (""Pay the Price""), tactical planning (""Nobody Can""), waging psychic warfare (""Melding of the Minds"")-- but no real sense of how he got there, what'll happen next, or anything else that gives a tangible sense of progressive storytelling. The skits just make it worse, since they hardly fit on such an otherwise straightfaced record-- why include a clip of David Chang shruggingly predicting that ""The Future of Food"" is a Jetsons machine, or give David Cross and Amber Tamblyn two goes at pretending to be cranky old people on an album where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27233-the-lonely-island/"" target=""_blank"">the Lonely Island</a> also rap about being cranky old people? For a narrative concept record, this is only marginally less coherent when it's put on shuffle.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So if it's not all that fun, and it's too convoluted to follow, why is this album still worth salvaging? Well, despite the overcooked jumble of your typical oft-delayed all-star concept record, it really does fall together as pure music. Just stop paying too much attention to Del's lyrics-- or at least pay enough attention to them that there's a brief jolt of vague futuristic intrigue when you hear the word ""lasers"" or ""Matrix""-- and that voice of his bobs and weaves with fluid timing that washes right over you like a sudden chill. It sounds weird put through a grandiose Joseph Campbell Hero's Journey, but it also sounds invigorated pitted alongside a production slate that brings out the percussive punch in every last syllable. Dan the Automator skews rock without flat-out </span><span>going </span><span>rock, integrating fuzz guitar (""Nobody Can"") or Sergio Leone twang (""Talent Supersedes"") as needed but sticking well to his wheelhouse of frantic strings, martial horns, and half-goth pop-soul that Kid Koala augments with characteristically off-kilter scratch work. It's also one of those weird rare alt-rap releases where nearly every hook is amazing, the luxury of getting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"" target=""_blank"">Damon Albarn</a> at his anguished best on ""What Is This Loneliness"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5804-mike-patton/"" target=""_blank"">Mike Patton</a> doing his shapeshifting-wraith thing deep in the mix of ""City Rising From the Ashes"". There've been more disappointing sequels, sure, and for something this long in development it turned out decent enough. But who goes to a Del album for a downer?</span></p></div>"|18499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18499-deltron-3030-event-ii/|5.7|Nate Patrin

Accompanied by the slogan “life is all about keeping a beat” the message that this is music to grow with may have been a little too on-the-nose, but this process of changing and maturing has been the underlying theme for the duo’s music since 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12630-leave-it-all-behind/"" target=""_blank""><i>Leave It All Behind</i></a>. Coming out after the dissolution of singer Phonte’s rap group Little Brother, that album’s embrace of R&amp;B felt like as much of a fulfillment of the title as its narratives of relationships in turmoil did. Phonte has generally positioned his move away from rap and into R&amp;B—and, more specifically, R&amp;B that explores the mundane intricacies of everyday relationships—as a maturation befitting someone his age (he’s now 34). Promoting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14781-authenticity/"" target=""_blank""><i>Authenticity</i></a> in 2010, he suggested that there was a void to fill for R&amp;B “about getting married, having kids, slowing down.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Love In Flying Colors </i><span>is shooting for that goal: Broadly, it’s a happy, settled album that seems to be about coming to terms with a new, stable relationship in the wake of a more tumultuous one. To achieve that tone, it’s more musically ambitious than anything the Foreign Exchange have attempted before, incorporating live instrumentation throughout and dabbling in a comfy palette of funk, soul, disco, soft rock, and touches of house. It’s crisp, familiar and accessible, but taking this approach also holds the group to a higher standard and plays against its strengths. Previous Foreign Exchange projects could lean a little bit on novelty: 2004’s </span><i>Connected </i><span>proved that engaging, soulful hip-hop could be created by a Dutch producer and a North Carolina rapper collaborating over the internet; </span><i>Leave It All Behind</i><span> showed that Phonte had a better singing voice than anyone expected; </span><i>Authenticity </i><span>was a moody, drifting work full of minimal, electronic production that presaged the wave of bedroom R&amp;B acts that would start sweeping blogs a year or two later. In contrast, </span><i>Love In Flying Colors </i><span>isn’t just holding itself up against historical precedent, it’s had the unfortunate luck of falling in the middle of a disco revival zeitgeist without the on-hand studio resources of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a> or Pharrell.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Phonte and Nicolay are great at building an atmosphere in which lyrical phrases are allowed to slowly unwind and Phonte’s voice is used to fill out tracks rather than punctuate them. The clean funk of </span><i>Love In Flying Colors </i><span>demands sharper songwriting and stronger vocals, though. If Phonte’s voice was a pleasant surprise when the group was creating understated neo-soul, it’s a bit of a liability when they’re gunning for full-on Kool &amp; the Gang thrills—a fact the duo seems to implicitly recognize by bringing in plenty of guest talent to handle some of the more ambitious melodies (one of the most fun things about the entire Foreign Exchange project is the way it’s grown from an email exchange into a fully fleshed-out musical community). Songs like “Better” and “On A Day Like Today” are missing the punch that would make them the fully realized celebrations they’re trying to be. In general, the album’s meandering middle section blends together, sitting in the same grooves for too long and offering little in the way of the memorable outbursts that this type of funk demands.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-234aa65a-6106-b85b-3498-7d9996c2cb08""><span>There may be a reason, too, why mature subjects like settling down, working through fights and getting married don’t yield much in the way of popular R&amp;B: a meaty phrase like “tell me you’ll stay by my side for all time/ Not just a moment” doesn’t exactly go down smoothly as the climax of a song like “The Moment”, which otherwise is a limber, pitch-perfect dancefloor exercise that shows the direct lineage between disco and early house. And that’s far from the cheesiest lyric on the album, which is heavy on oversimplifications like “sometimes it all feels so enormous/ I wonder why we even try.” Where the album does reign things in lyrically and the mood breaks away from muted satisfaction or confusion into actual excited joy, it’s clear what </span><i>Love In Flying Colors </i><span>could be. Opener “If I Knew Then” is triumphant in its breezy declaration that “love’s flying high,” and “Dreams Are Made For Two”, a duet with frequent Phonte collaborator Carlitta Durand, is inviting with its climbing synths and pillowy bass line, even if its couples getaway fantasy verges on wild over-sentimentality. Is there a reason that the songs tend to work better the more unreservedly happy they are? Getting to that self-assured, carefree place in which this type of music works best isn’t easy, and, unlike in the past, the Foreign Exchange aren’t letting themselves hide confusion behind studio tricks. This is all-out openness and clarity, which, for better or for worse, is just a little more grown-up.</span></span></p></div>"|18531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18531-the-foreign-exchange-love-in-flying-colors/|6.5|Kyle Kramer

Both bands have a fondness for flooding the marketplace with new material: by the time we're through with 2013, Connections will add a third LP to their catalog. Hell, frontman Kevin Elliott even finds himself singing with the slightest whiff of a British accent, a trademark Pollardism that, as Pitchfork's Aaron Leitko wrote of this spring's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18038-connections-private-airplane/"" target=""_blank""><i>Private Airplane</i></a>, suggests more than a little time spent kneeling at the altar of <i>Bee Thousand</i>. But, while GBV's best songs spoke of rock'n'roll as a galvanizing force, a source of salvation-- ""I shoot myself with rock'n'roll,"" Bob Pollard sang on ""I Am a Scientist"", but ""nothing else can set me free""-- Connections seem to see it as a way to hold themselves together in the face of everyday chaos.</p>
<p>On <i>Body Language</i>, Connections' second LP on the year, Elliott explores what it's like to be down-and-out on the cusp of drinking age. The people in Connections' songs are old enough to know better but young enough not to care all that much; their romantic ideas about love and life have started to crumble, but they're still not quite sure how to fill that gap. So they crash on couches, punch timeclocks, and hate the friends they keep falling for. ""I know you're aimless,"" he sings on the set's first song; later, it's ""I take it fuckin' easy."" The consequences of all that taking it easy, all those ""dreams that turn to embarrassment,"" have only just started to set in. But to these slackers, inertia's a killer; it's easier to promise yourself you'll wake up and do better than to actually get up and do it. <i>Body Language</i> doesn't wallow in these feelings, but it certainly speaks to them, and if you've ever woken up hungover with your neck draped across some half-stranger's sectional sofa, you're liable to see yourself somewhere in these songs.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Body Language</i> offers considerably more uplift. Like GBV, they're as scrappy as they are stirring; they stumble into bridges and gallop through choruses, throwing an extra chord in wherever it'll fit without bogging down the songs' forward motion, barely letting one song end before they careen into the next. Lead guitarist Dave Capaldi's screaming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"" target=""_blank"">J. Mascis</a>-style leads take a frontseat here, to the benefit of everybody; not only does he have Mascis' tone down cold, but he's got that same combination of reserve and abandon, that ability to inject genuine emotion into a cluster of notes. Highlights are everywhere: the casually exuberant ""Summer Creeps"" nicks the chords from Semisonic's ""Closing Time"" and a couple lines from Tom Petty's ""Last Dance With Mary Jane"" to pay tribute to another wasted season, but not before he spits out the punky ""Girl's Night Out"" like a stomach full of cheap vodka quickly curdling in his stomach. Every melody's sharp, some even border on regal. But Connections tear through each one of them with slacker's nonchalance, as if banging out a song as good and pure as ""Blurry Eyes"" is just no big deal.</p>
<p>""They didn't plan much—just an escape route, and a sweet follow through,"" Elliott sings on ""Jeni and Johnny"", the story of two go-nowhere kids who decide they might just be born to run after all. If Connections have a mission statement, it's probably that: they don't, at first, seem like the get-up-and-go types, but when push comes to shove, they've got all the drive and determination they need. For a certain strain of indie rocker, <i>Body Language</i> is pure catnip. But it's more than that: a smart, stupendously catchy, often downright inspiring examination of the things that get us going in spite of ourselves, set to one head-stick melody after the other.</p></div>"|18556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18556-connections-body-language/|7.4|Paul Thompson

Plus I do a lot of recording at night.” She may try to keep her music muffled in her apartment, but she managed to catch the ear of Tokyo’s <a href=""http://flau.jp/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flau</a> records, the nation’s premier label for hushed music. Flau deals in sparseness, from the kitchen-sink electronics of Kyoto’s <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mad-egg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Madegg</a> to the nature-loving synth-pop of Cokiyu, who has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14942-various-artists-twinkle-way-ft-baths/"" target=""_blank"">teamed up with Baths</a>. The imprint was a good place for Cuushe to hone her restrained style, and it nabbed American performers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Holter</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29901-motion-sickness-of-time-travel/"" target=""_blank"">Motion Sickness of Time Travel</a> to remix her work last year. The results are on display in her second full-length album, <i>Butterfly Case</i>, which exploits her space-induced limitations to create a captivating collection of dream pop.  </p>
<p>Like the artists who reworked her songs, Cuushe lets her music develop gradually and seems in no particular rush. Many of the songs on <i>Butterfly Case </i>run for more than five minutes, starting in a wispy synth haze before eventually blooming into more complex structures. First track “Sort of Light” takes cues from dance music, opening with muted pulses before a minimal beat pushes the song forward. Cuushe adds sonic details one at a time, building the track into a formidable whirl of sound that could even prompt nervous shuffling on a dancefloor. On “Twilight”, Cuushe launches with lush synths, but eventually pivots the track into a gallop that ups the urgency and snaps it out of its daydream</p>
<p><i>Butterfly Case </i>makes the most of this slowly swirling template, to the point where songs start sounding mechanical in the album’s second half. Late-album track “Swing Your Heart” sounds unremarkable after six previous numbers did the slow-build routine much better. More tedious are the instances where Cuushe just drifts, largely eschewing beats in favor of just letting the music float. While it sounds dreamy, it also rings aimless and feels like filler.</p>
<p>Cuushe, though, can thank her cramped recording quarters for helping to emphasize her best sonic quality and the reason she isn’t a generic dream pop peddler. Her vocals are soft, never overpowering the music on <i>Butterfly Case;</i> it's often hard to discern any words, so her voice acts as additional sonic texture, lending the production some extra depth. They can also add emotional impact—her drawn out syllables give “Twilight” a sense of longing, while on closer “Hanabi”, they sound hopeful.  <i>  </i> </p>
<p>She’s at her best, though, when her singing manages to break through the dreaminess and deliver a simple and direct emotion. “I Miss You” boasts one of <i>Butterfly Case’s </i>best buildups, seemingly peaking with a sing-song melody before whirring synths fade out and Cuushe sighs, “I want to be with you.” Album highlight “I Love You” layers Cuushe’s voice over itself multiple times for the first half of the song, but then she suddenly emerges clear from the haze as she bluntly delivers the titular phrase over and over again. It’s moments like these, where she imbues her songs with a breath-on-neck intimacy, when her second album stands out, and you almost can picture Cuushe quietly creating in her thin-walled apartment. </p></div>"|18597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18597-cuushe-butterfly-case/|7.0|Patrick St. Michel

He could have left us with images of a dignified pop star, as seen in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49561-watch-justin-timberlake-and-jay-zs-suit-and-tie-video-directed-by-david-fincher/"">David Fincher's flawless ""Suit &amp; Tie"" video</a>, or the beguiling second half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50023-watch-justin-timberlakes-somber-two-part-mirrors-video/"">the visual for ""Mirrors""</a>, where he offers graceful steps inside of a mysterious, reflecting maze.

He could have left us wanting more. He didn't. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2 </i>is not only superfluous, it actually erases some of the gains made by its predecessor as it plays into the worst trappings of self-indulgence. Taken from the same 2012 sessions that birthed <i>The 20/20 Experience, </i>this album shows off similar musical tactics—multi-part songs that routinely push the seven-minute mark, dense arrangements, Timbaland-helmed syncopation—but instead of acting like a complement, it sounds like the unripe fruits of a warm-up. Whereas <i>1 of 2</i> found a retro-futuristic freshness by mixing detailed percussion with string-laden, old-Hollywood glamor, <i>2 of 2</i> rehashes many of the same sonic tics of Timberlake and Timbaland's seven-year-old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11888-futuresexlovesounds/"" target=""_blank""><i>FutureSex/LoveSounds</i></a>, and, in turn, points to a much more stunted spectrum of creativity.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Speaking of stunted: Timberlake recently joked that this new record is ""more slutty"" than its ""virginal"" partner, and its subject matter can certainly be offensive—not because of its sexual nature but rather how disturbingly <i>unsexy</i> the singer makes it all sound. Despite ""SexyBack""—which, with its motorik pulse and metallic vocal effects, was more cybersex-y, anyway—Timberlake's lock-step perfectionism always lent itself more to idealized romance than unadulterated attraction. And too often here, his come-ons are corny enough to elicit facepalms from sixth graders. ""Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first,"" he suggests on ""Cabaret"", seemingly accompanied by a dumb, punny smirk. His supporting cast doesn't help. Timbaland shows up only to play the role of embarrassing uncle on ""TKO"", starting the track off with unfortunately appropriate (and gross) baby talk: ""She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a> can't help but get in on the act on ""Murder"", where he hypothesizes on the efficacy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"" target=""_blank"">Yoko Ono</a>'s vagina: ""Know that shit gotta be lethal/ If that pussy broke up the Beatles/ Chocha ruined pop culture."" Yes, he really says ""chocha."" And no, it doesn't sound better when you hear him rapping it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Part of the problem with such idiotic horniness is a matter of tone; if any of the above lines and/or songs were refashioned as ""Saturday Night Live"" skits, they would likely prove more effective (and markedly less disconcerting). In particular, the only way to make the years-late nearly-10-minute sexy-vampire track ""True Blood"" at all palatable would be to pair it with a knowingly campy video, a la ""Thriller"". Obviously, Timberlake can be very funny on purpose—he's arguably the best ""SNL"" host of the last decade. But, maybe due to his boy-band past or the fact that he's dabbling in traditionally black styles of music, he's self-consciously made the separation between his joke tracks and his serious songs very clear. This straight face served him well on <i>The 20/20 Experience</i>'s odes to devotion, but it makes him look silly here. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Elsewhere, when he's not chasing after women with his tongue unraveling to his feet, Looney Tunes-style, he's pissed off. And if there's an emotion that suits Timberlake less than rampant lustfulness, it's anger. This is the guy who'll gush that he has ""the best wife in the world"" on ""Ellen"", who does everything in his power to be liked at all times. Which is not to say his ire is invalid. But, as depicted on <i>2 of 2</i>, it is clunky. His heartbrokenness falls flat on the twangy Kid Rock-type plastic blues of ""Drink You Away"", and ""Only When I Walk Away"" tries (and fails) to go for the same spurned emotions as ""What Goes Around… Comes Around"", before Timberlake ends it with the couplet, ""She only love me when I walk away/ I said, 'Fuck you bitch, we no care what you say.'"" This is followed by a little laugh that seems to say ""just kidding!"" but the tough-guy pose still leaves a rancid taste. </p>
<p class=""p3"">When Timberlake went into the studio with Timbaland last year, they didn't necessarily plan to make an album. His manager <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-justin-timberlakes-20-20-experience-sequel-20130816"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">figured</a> a single or an EP might arise from the 20 days of recording. But here we are with two albums—144 minutes of music in total. It's about 70 minutes too much, an unwarranted glut. Based on the performance of this album's singles thus far—the good-enough ""Take Back the Night"" peaked at No. 29 while the laborious ""TKO"" just entered the charts at No. 54—public demand is significantly waning as well. With <i>The 20/20 Experience, </i>Timberlake asked his audience to accept a twisty album of love songs that was out-of-step with today's bass-first pop-radio fodder. No matter the amount of soul-sucking promotional tie-ins involved—and there were many—it was a risky gambit, and it paid off on virtually every level. With <i>2 of 2</i>, he's a happily married man asking us to take in an album of awful pick up lines and phony angst, all over an endless bed of reheated production. It's a bridge too far.</p></div>"|18548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18548-justin-timberlake-the-2020-experience-2-of-2/|4.5|Ryan Dombal

That Travis Stewart has since moved from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>-shadowed downtempo abstraction to triple-digit BPMs and retro junglist breaks doesn't change things too much, either. Always handy with muted, distorted droning chords and shredded flakes of melody, Machinedrum's breakthrough as an in-demand name in bass music is a logical destination in the long run; all that there was left to wait for was a context.</p>
<p>That context is getting pretty familiar-- distant, lonely vocal refrains from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a> playbook glazed over a rhythm that could be shorthanded as juke'n'bass. If <i>Room(s) </i>set the stage, and his work with Praveen Sharma as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29967-sepalcure/"" target=""_blank"">Sepalcure</a> expanded the palette, <i>Vapor City </i>finds Machinedrum getting comfortable inside the parameters that juiced his reptuation. But he's made that formula effective enough that the visceral, emotional lift hasn't faded any. The early signs were there with key single “Gunshotta”: snare-kick fusillades shivering like they have hypothermia, flourescent synthesizer chords reflecting off wet pavement, tunnel-echo fragments of deep soul singing that are so distressed they harmonize cleanly with ruffneck ragga vocals. It's practically archetypal at this point. It's also straight-up gorgeous.</p>
<p><i>Vapor City </i>is front-loaded with those kinds of moments. Part of the thrill of listening to “Infinite Us” is hearing those yearning piano notes that open it and wondering how they'll be put through the wringer; the slow build to a huge, gleaming ascension on the back of a harplike guitar arpeggio only heightens the pull between the delicate melodies and the full-steam-ahead percussion. For a while, it feels like there are endless ways for him to shadowbox the rhythm. “Don't 1 2 Lose U” puts every note of its percussive synthesizer riff through a slight flange effect that, coupled with the wavering vocal sample that gives it its title, makes it sound like the downpour 808s are rattling a film soundtrack off the spools. And opening “Center Your Love” with a gradual un-muffling of its airy dream-pop vocal-driven riff is a slow focus into euphoria; its deep, spare set of piano/guitar chords are a vivid setup for the best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a> loop Boards of Canada never made.</p>
<p>The novelty doesn't come across as strongly on the album's latter half-- after an early peak, <i>Vapor City</i> plays all its hands and settles into a more stripped-down stretch to the end. While it's more likely to feel like acclimation than pointless wheel-spinning stasis, it also has the air of the almost-complete to it, like these sparser tracks are waiting for a vocalist to complete it a'la “SXLND” becoming the backbone for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29999-azealia-banks/"" target=""_blank"">Azealia Banks</a>' “NEEDSUMLUV”. Put the demarcation line at “Vizion”, a submerged descent into crumbling ambient, and everything afterwards is merely deep-cut solid. There are bigger disappointments than this, granted-- the worst you can say about the second half of <i>Vapor City </i>is that it's something of a weird choice to sequence two consecutive tracks with “lie” so prominent in the vocal hook (the downtempo Italians Do It Better-adjacent synthpop of “U Still Lie” and the hyperventilating footwork of “Eyesdontlie”). It could just be a matter of volume, really. When you crank this album loud, it's not just the beats that rattle the system, though they're as crisply forceful as ever. It's the intricate musical subtleties Stewart weaves through them that blow your hair back.</p></div>"|18513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18513-machine-drum-vapor-city/|7.8|Nate Patrin

<p dir=""ltr"">There isn’t a lot of precedent for what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Yuck</a>’s doing on their sophomore LP <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i>.While it’s not unusual for groups in more moneyed genres to survive the departure of their lead singer, they tend to bring on a hired gun—Brian Johnson, Sammy Hagar, Peter Cetera, whoever’s singing in Journey right now. But typically in indie rock, when the frontperson’s done, the band is too. So here’s Yuck, not only carrying on without Daniel Blumberg, but also making the rare internal promotion in guitarist Max Bloom, who sang on one track last time out (“Operation”). And yet, Yuck seems like a good candidate to pull this off, because their inexhaustibly replayable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15068-yuck/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">self-titled debut</a> from 2011 was nothing <i>but</i> precedent—they were the best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Yo La Tengo</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3998-superchunk/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Superchunk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Built to Spill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> songs you may have heard in years, but done with enough spirit, melody and grace to serve as tough competition for the originals. This isn’t to denigrate the contribution of Blumberg, after all, he co-wrote and sang the vast majority of <i>Yuck</i>. But as long as they didn’t ditch their CD collection, they’re still Yuck, right? Well, on <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i>, Yuck do indeed get further and deeper into their personal canon. The problem that while <i>Yuck</i> was an excellent facsimile of excellent bands, <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i> is a pretty good facsimile of pretty good bands, a multiplication of fractions. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Or, to put it another way, they’ve exhausted the A-list of 90s indie rock and are now modeling themselves after the next tier: we’re talking Lush, Buffalo Tom, the Lemonheads, maybe Teenage Fanclub if we’re being generous. As a result, <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i> just sounds like <i>Yuck</i> on muscle relaxants much of the time —“Lose My Breath” and “Middle Sea” boast the same kind of fuzzed-up leads that made the guitars of  “Georgia” or “Get Away” as easy to sing along with as the vocals, but little of their frazzled energy. Meanwhile, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16090-yuck-memorial-fields/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">“Memorial Fields”</a> avoids getting too close to <i>Yuck</i>’s hangdog ballad “Suck” simply by insulating itself with synthesized strings.</p>
</div>
<p>This shift was inevitable from a physiological standpoint, as Yuck traded Blumberg’s nasal sneer for the more soft-palate lilt of Bloom. The ostensible maturation of their sound was also abetted by the production of Chris Coady, who helped guide <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28000-the-smith-westerns/"">Smith Westerns</a> from a raw and tuneful debut into a more lush, distinctly British aesthetic (though on their first album, Yuck was a British band that sounded extremely American). For all intents and purposes, this sounds like their major-label debut: whereas a trumpet solo bisected “Suicide Policeman”, there are <i>horns</i> on <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i> and keyboards often take the place of pedal-altered guitars for a means to add ambience. As a result, there are a few keepers that indulge in sounds that weren’t available to Yuck on their self-produced debut; “Rebirth” is palpably lush shoegaze, while the honeyed college rock of “Lose My Breath” a convincing candidate for primetime 1995 MTV play rather than ""120 Minutes."" But for the most part, Coady and Bloom combine to smooth out songs that lacked edge to begin with and <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i> sounds far more homogenous than its predecessor even if boasts a near equal array of acoustic strummers, wandering instrumentals and indie rock classicism.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is that in losing Blumberg, Yuck aren’t just missing their lead singer, they’re missing a true frontman, someone who can actually speak for them. <i>Yuck</i> wasn’t much for idiosyncrasy, but it did have a personality—it just so happened that the alternately bummed and bristling indie rock of the 90s served as a perfect conveyance for Blumberg’s lyrics, which found him dumped or just kinda in the dumps. While being every bit as plainspoken, Bloom is harder to read<i>—Glow &amp; Behold</i>’s song titles (“Out of Time”, “Lose My Breath”, “Somewhere”, “Nothing New”, “How Does it Feel”) suggest a topical generality and without much elaboration, it’s difficult to figure out what inspired the members of Yuck to create <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i> besides the urge or necessity to make a second album.</p>
<p>Since the split between Yuck and their erstwhile frontman doesn’t seem all that amicable, it’s tempting to view Blumberg’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18292-hebronix-unreal/"">debut</a> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31308-hebronix"">Hebronix</a> in competition with <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i>. They’re about even, but the comparison is deflating because it confirms exactly what you’d expect: <i>Unreal</i> had shambling charm for days (or at least 35 minutes), but lacked structure and melodic guidance, whereas with <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i>, it’s vice versa. Or, while <i>Yuck</i> made listeners nostalgic for the first Clinton term, <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i> will just make you wish it was 2011 again.</p></div>"|18582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18582-yuck-glow-behold/|6.1|Ian Cohen

One of the core bands to emerge from the same roiling soup that birthed art-damaged titans such as the Flying Luttenbachers and the Locust, the female-fronted Japanese group added a few twists to the genetic makeup of 90s noise rock. Japan’s own rich noise tradition was little more than a touchstone for Melt-Banana, and the group’s cryptic otherness elevated it above its peers. It was easy to see that Weasel Walter was a virtuoso slumming it, and that Justin Pearson was a snotty powerviolence kid with a schtick. But Melt-Banana? Who knew what they were thinking? After a six-year break from making studio albums, the new full-length <i>fetch </i>doesn’t answer that question. But it makes that question even more head-spinning. </p>
<p>Melt-Banana left listeners on a curious note with 2007’s frighteningly poppy <i>Bambi’s Dilemma, </i>but that dissonance has been resolved on <i>fetch</i>, in true Melt-Banana fashion, with more dissonance. This is the Melt-Banana of their mid-90s prime: salivating Pavlovianly over the acceleration of culture, twisting the tools of psychedelia into things of surgical precision, and envisioning cyberpunk grindcore before reality knew it could bear the weight of such a thing. It still might not—but <i>fetch </i>at least harmonizes more disharmoniously with the tenor of the times. Gleeful terror pours out of tracks like “Candy Gun” and “Then Red Eyed”; the fact that they’re the longest and shortest song on the disc, respectively, only bookends the dilation of spacetime that guitarist and effects technician Ichirou Agata is able to accomplish. Like a proto 8-bit composer using a looping delay pedal to preemptively echo a deterministic future, he’s a watchmaker winding up a thousand thrash riffs at once then letting them go.</p>
<p>It’s up to Yasuko Onuki to lend a human voice to Agata’s nanotech contraptions. She’s never sounded more savagely ecstatic. On “Red Data, Red Stage” she’s like Dog Faced Hermans’ Marion Coutts sprinting on bipolar impulse, all Situationist cheerleader chants and sugary chirp. Phonetically, it’s all splinters and crystal. Melt-Banana’s grindcore roots, vestigial in the first place, are now only dim memories. Just as the quaint notion of sudden, cataclysmic apocalypse has been replaced in the new millennium by gradual, nonlinear collapse, so does <i>fetch </i>frolic in anachronism, a swarm of data-fragments retroactively reordered and held together with hair and bubblegum. “The Hive” is proof: An intro that resembles “Eruption”-era Eddie Van Halen eaten some yet unimagined remake of <i>Tron </i>opens space for Onuki’s sideways singsong, the filtered cry of bitmapped anxiety.</p>
<p>That Melt-Banana is making some of the best music of their career—over 20 years into the band’s existence—speaks to the universal and transcendent quality of their noise. The landscape of media, society, and even the microcosm of noise rock has changed greatly, but Onuki and Agata have locked jaws on the diametric constants: energy versus agitation, phobia versus euphoria, and instant nostalgia versus the relentless pursuit of the upgrade. <i>fetch</i> is Melt-Banana’s own upgrade, a bleeding-edge reiteration of their fractured and manicured chaos. There’s a moment in the album’s closer, “Zero”, in which Onuki punches her way through a web of M<i>ö</i>bius-strip riffage to project a fleeting, Technicolor afterimage of <i>Dilemma</i>’s pop-punk melodicism; then it seizes up, hits the gas, and splatters against a brick wall. A moment later, it reconstitutes itself and barrels forward as if nothing happened. In a breathless whirlwind kind of way, <i>fetch</i> does the same for Melt-Banana.</p></div>"|18577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18577-melt-banana-fetch/|7.8|Jason Heller

Keyboardist and vocalist Daron Beck and drummer Jon Teague flip the idea of what metal can be by employing aggression and tense space without guitars, “riffs” in the traditional sense, or anything in the traditional metal sense, really. Pinkish Black resemble a Popol Vuh that suddenly became obsessed with denim and leather, or an enterprising Goblin that, after doing scores for Dario Argento, discovered that headbangers love horror movies. Their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16620-pinkish-black/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, released on Handmade Birds last year, was a promising collection, albiet one that could have benefitted from a little focus. And while Teague's kick drum doesn't make your heart conform to its beat on <i>Razed to the Ground</i>, their second album and first for the large metal label Century Media, it is a more accurate summation of what the band is capable of doing.</p>
<p>Pinkish Black excel when Beck cranks the distorted bass and Teague gets busy on the kit. In this regard, “Kites and Vultures” and “Rise” are the album's standout tracks, as they maximize both of those strengths. In addition, they're the only two tracks that start in kill mode, rather than making the audience wait for the explosion. Had Zombi faced more pressure from Relapse to be more like the bands Relapse usually signs-- that is, aggressive or at least putting on a facade of “aggressive”-- they may have put out something like the title track. There's that <i>Signals</i>-era Rush groove, injected with more bass and menace. Of the band's slower songs, closer “Loss of Feeling of Loss” merges the band's Kraut tendencies with their metallic side the most cohesively. <i>Razed</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s sequencing is modeled much like their live show, to its advantage. It starts off with a rush, moves into a spacier sequence to let the audience screw their heads back on, trips into another round of pummeling, and then ends with one last suspension of gravity. Whereas the self-titled felt like just a collection of songs, <i>Razed</i> has a more concrete arc. Chalk it up to signing to a major label or chalk it up to experience, but either way, Pinkish Black are finding themselves.</span></p>
<p>While <i>Razed</i> is mostly a precise album, some of the wandering eye that hindered the self-titled collection still creeps up. “Bad Dreamer” could use more judicious editing; the sections work in and of themselves, but could be more solidly linked. As sublime as “Loss” is, after a couple minutes of silence comes random high piano notes thrown into the void that killed Frank Poole. A throwback to the hidden tracks from nü-metal CDs? The world's most esoteric tribute to Pantera's “Sandblasted Skin”? Whatever it is, that ending feels tacked on and unnecessary. For a band so dependent on structure-- which, given metal's history of eschewing improvisation, is not an issue-- it feels out of character and a betrayal of sorts. Even given these faults, the rest of the record suggests a stronger, more confident Pinkish Black.</p></div>"|18368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18368-pinkish-black-razed-to-the-ground/|7.2|Andy O'Connor

The Los Angeles sisters played guitar and bass, respectively, in the tween-pop quintet that was assembled and signed to major label Columbia in 2004, with 1980s soft-rock linchpin Richard Marx attached as a creative contributor. The results were decidedly mixed: there was the acoustic melodrama of <i>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</i> soundtrack cut <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFmH4gGr7HE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Always There in You""</a>, the cruelly ironic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrM7xJpZbnw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Born to Lead""</a> (""My independent voice will have its say""), and most notoriously, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1JD7-Mydtw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's a Hair Thing""</a>, the dog whistle-pitched theme song for the short-lived animated TV show ""Trollz"".</p>
<p>This early group wasn't the beginning of the Haim sisters' musical career—the pair had been performing covers with the rest of their family, including youngest sister Alana, since they were old enough to hold instruments. ""We're just ourselves,"" a 17-year-old Este Haim was quoted as saying in <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/so-cal-teen-prodigies-the-valli-girls-launch-pop-rock-campaign-54307652.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a 2005 press release</a> that touted the Valli Girls' debut album, <i>Valli Nation</i>. That sentiment wasn't entirely true: as <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2013/06/25/haim-best-friends-forever/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Fader story</a> from earlier this year detailed, musical prodigies Danielle and Este weren't all that into playing songs that they didn't write, so they pulled out of their contract. The family band was christened with the endearingly dorky name Rockinhaim, thereafter shortened to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a> when the sisters decided to strike out on their own in 2006.</p>
<p>So far, the story of Haim has seemed ripe for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0269677/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the type of movie you'd catch playing on VH1 on a Sunday afternoon</a> and <i>Days Are Gone</i>, the trio's outstanding full-length debut, is the latest plot twist. The album arrives just as Haim's impeccably crafted mix of influences—soft rock's incandescent glow, R&amp;B's sensuality, the spiky-yet-polished effervescence of pop-rock—are more fashionable than ever. But Haim weren't just raised on these genres; they were raised to <i>perform</i> them; they may benefit from perfect timing, but they scan as anything but opportunistic.</p>
<p>Since <i>Days Are Gone</i> single and blog-buzz fire-starter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14405-forever-lindstrom-prins-thomas-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""Forever""</a> made the rounds in early 2012, Haim have often been mentioned alongside Fleetwood Mac; critic Ann Powers recently <a href=""https://twitter.com/annkpowers/status/382612033436270592"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">described</a> their sound as an encapsulation of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_1987"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billboard's Hot 100 singles of 1987</a>, which included the Mac's <i>Tango in the Night</i> single ""Little Lies"". The comparison is not without merit—much of the dusky, ebullient ""Honey &amp; I"", one of Days Are Gone's highest highs, sounds as if <i>The Reminder</i>-era Feist fused together the acoustic riffs of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmQVg14c-Ko"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Don't Want to Know""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVfiMFoCl3k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Never Going Back Again""</a>. But Haim also channel the best elements of their current peers: Phoenix's compressed pop economics, the cool-handed spaciousness of Arctic Monkeys' recent work, and Spoon's wound-coil precision.</p>
<p>The latter quality is Haim's secret weapon. Along with drummer and L.A. scene fixture Dash Hutton, Haim sound as tight and in-the-pocket as you'd expect from a group of people that have spent most of their lives making music. Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford (Arctic Monkeys, Klaxons) and studio-man-of-the-moment Ariel Rechtshaid (Vampire Weekend, Usher) both receive co-writing and production credits and contribute just the right touches to Haim's sleek, streamlined arrangements. The record's mix is translucent and refreshingly bare-bones, which affords plenty of space for <i>Days Are Gone</i>'s many indelible hooks—the twitchy R&amp;B of ""If I Could Change Your Mind"", ""Don't Save Me""'s rollicking bursts of euphoria, the resonant melancholia of closer ""Running If You Call My Name""—to work their uncanny magic.</p>
<p>When you hear about the influences and consider just how slick the record can be, you might imagine Haim coming over as faceless. But the band's most unusual quality on <i>Days Are Gone</i> is their ability to absorb inputs and continue to sound distinct. The album's punchy title track was co-written by Jessie Ware, another artist who's made a name replicating the sounds of pop's past, along with Ware's frequent songwriting collaborator Kid Harpoon (""Wildest Moments"", ""Night Light""); Ware and Harpoon's style is usually easy to pick out, but it's barely felt on ""Days Are Gone"", as Danielle Haim's staccato delivery pops and locks where Ware's vocals would have crested and swelled. That Haim retain their identity through collaboration speaks to their confidence. </p>
<p>The lyrics on <i>Days Are Gone</i> aren't necessarily built to withstand close analysis; largely, the words function to add a bit of weight to the effortless, feather-light melodies, but Haim do know how to turn a phrase. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15784-haim-the-wire/"" target=""_blank"">""The Wire""</a>, especially, has some of group's most effective lines, a level-headed act of kiss-off kindness (""I gave it all away/ Just so I could say that/ Well I know that you're gonna be OK anyway"") paired with a rolling melody that makes the song one of the most benevolent breakup anthems since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv644ipg2Ss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robyn's ""Call Your Girlfriend""</a>. </p>
<p><i>Days Are Gone</i> is so polished that Haim could easily be seen as clinical and lifeless, but their lighthearted attitude complements their recording rigor. Whether they're covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52428-watch-haim-cover-miley-cyrus-wrecking-ball/"">Miley Cyrus</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkd47bcQHxM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sheryl Crow</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/estebassface"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">making ""bass faces""</a>, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JLa4lYGE5I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reuniting Rockinhaim by bringing their own parents on stage for a rendition of ""Mustang Sally""</a>, Haim come over as affable, playing-to-the-rafters rock stars as well as studio pros. Taken as a whole, the project is a testament to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0515236/quotes?item=qt0241080"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">what's most important</a>, and <i>Days Are Gone</i>'s divine pleasures suggest that, rock history be damned, family business doesn't always have to be dysfunctional.</p></div>"|18574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18574-haim-days-are-gone/|8.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31237-fuzz/"">Fuzz</a>, even though he's stepped back to the drumset, he's still the singer, he's still helping to write the songs, and he's <i>really </i>good at drumming. Segall's records come with that inevitable ""prolific songwriter"" baggage, and that might be why Fuzz tried to stay anonymous when they released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49030-listen-ty-segall-forms-new-band-fuzz/"">their first single</a>. Maybe the trio were trying to sidestep the Segall conversation altogether. Of course, it didn't work. It was always pretty easy to figure out who was singing those songs, and it didn't help when they outed themselves as Fuzz to <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/ty-segall-twins-interview-new-garage-renaissance?page=4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Spin</i></a> before even releasing a Fuzz record. Once again, at least in their press coverage, Segall receives top billing.</p>
<p>But with an almost startlingly generic band name (that has been <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/search?q=fuzz&amp;type=artist"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">used a few times already</a>), it feels clear that the attention was never meant to be solely Ty's this time. Fuzz is a power trio—a united front of longhairs who work together to build a hard rock soundscape. It's not about the people, it's about the <i>fuzz</i>, man. Segall's vocals pack the cartoon menace of early Sabbath Ozzy, and his drumming is precise-yet-loose, powerful, thrilling. Roland Cosio helms a steady, groove-ready low end. Then there's Charles Moothart, the quiet guitarist who helped create the obliterating guitar sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/""><i>Slaughterhouse</i></a>. He's also the band's riff writer—he'd set up a riff, Segall would help him finish it and add lyrics. You don't have to live with <i>Fuzz</i> for very long before it's clear that the riffs and guitar solos are the main event. Moothart deserves just as much limelight as Segall.</p>
<p>Take the opening moments of ""Sleigh Ride"", ""Raise"", and ""Loose Sutures""—all are kicked off by a meaty and catchy guitar line. One minute, Moothart's busting an enormous guitar solo on ""Loose Sutures"", the next he's doing some delicate, somber work in ""Hazemaze"". He even gets to step out front on ""Raise"", contributing a rare vocal turn where his assertive baritone takes a cynical look at the existance of God. And his voice sounds really good over this proto-metal guitar rock. In a vocals-specific analogy comparing Ty Segall Band to the Who, Segall is Daltrey (the electric frontman vocalist), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29837-mikal-cronin/"">Mikal Cronin</a> is Townshend (the tenor who can scream real good), and apparently, Charles Moothart is Entwistle (the traditionally quieter one who could totally be the lead singer if he wanted to).</p>
<p>But again, while everybody gets their individual moment to shine, it'd be short-sighted to pick an MVP in Fuzz. This album finds strength in the loud, jam-centric prowess of all three dudes playing together. As a unit, they achieve power, drive, and soul. They've got the same chutzpah the MC5 had on <i>Kick Out the Jams</i>, but Fuzz don't sing about revolution. They sing about burning, bleeding, and burials. They're like a murder-obsessed Blue Cheer. On ""Sleigh Ride"", belting in a goblin voice and spitting out every consonant as hard as he can, Segall sings, ""Isolation,/ Isolation,/ Feel the stiffness of isolation."" Meanwhile, the band establishes vicious, galloping pace—intimidation all around, nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>Like <i>Slaughterhouse</i> before it, <i>Fuzz</i> is an album that depends heavily on power. But while the trio keep muscle and intimidation in play throughout the album, they also leave room to calm down and breathe. Stuff like ""I Bought My Eyes"" stacked power upon power for an entire track, inviting you to speed across the highway or sprint to the finish of a particularly difficult run or lift an impossibly heavy object. ""Loose Sutures"" comes to a full stop in the middle, leaving only the persistent hiss of feedback. For two minutes, there's no adrenaline rush—it forces you to be patient while Cosio rides out a bass solo and while Ty offers up a few drum fills. And then, a slow build of drums into a full, loud, utterly satisfying wall of sound that crashes through to the finish. It's a similar technique to the one Sabbath implemented on <i>Paranoid </i>by placing the mellow ""Planet Caravan"" between ""Paranoid"" and ""Iron Man"". ""Loose Sutures"" has sweet harmonies, feedback-coated quiet, noise, and a searing guitar solo—it's definitely a well-crafted hard rock song.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's an album that would benefit from a few more sonically diverse moments like that one or the quiet sprawl of <i>Fuzz</i>'s opening stretch. The band is obviously very good at delivering infectious hooks with muscle and soul, but those moments only pop if there's a control in place to offset the heavier stuff. Otherwise, the record becomes one big mass of fuzzy low-end guitars and occasional solos. Fuzz consistently run the risk of noodling for a bit too long or pushing one idea a little too far. It's tricky to balance loud and quiet, and Fuzz are still finding their footing. They thrive when they're locked into a sturdy, well-constructed groove like ""Fuzz's Fourth Dream"" (which, as a stand-alone 7"", is the band's best release to date). But in <i>Fuzz</i>'s 36 minutes, Segall, Moothart, and Cosio find several satisfyingly stoned, overwhelmingly powerful hooks. That's a good place to start.</p></div>"|18570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18570-fuzz-fuzz/|7.3|Evan Minsker

They're kind of ironic lyrics coming from a band that keeps scraping the bottom of a barrel of older influences—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">the Beach Boys</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"">the Band</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5104-the-faces/"">the Faces</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"">the Dead</a>, CSNY for good measure, Captain Beefheart <a href=""http://new.livestream.com/livestreamsessions/drdog"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in interviews</a>. And yet, it's a fitting personal statement considering Carl Wilson's <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2013/09/the_lumineers_and_mumford_sons_what_they_could_learn_from_neko_case.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent evaluation</a> of another critically panned, fan-beloved outfit: Mumford &amp; Sons. Quoting <a href=""http://www.spin.com/reviews/mumford-and-sons-babel-gentlemen-of-the-roadglassnote/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chuck Eddy</a>, Wilson wrote, ""The Mumfords barely skim the surface. They don't seem remotely musically curious."" The same can be said of Dr. Dog, which has rarely made music with any real sense of urgency or ambition, much less curiosity about their predecessors. (In related news, Dr. Dog is currently touring with the Lumineers.)</p>
<p>To their credit, Dr. Dog did attempt an overhaul for their seventh full-length, <i>B-Room</i>. The band started from the ground up, building a new studio and living quarters in an abandoned silversmith factory in their hometown of Philadelphia. They recorded <i>B-Room</i> in the studio space they named it after, for the first time taking advantage of their strengths as performers and tracking everything live. The difference is subtle at best, but their decision not to complicate things with overdubs contributed to the refreshing straightforwardness of a few songs, including their sparest yet, ""Too Weak to Ramble"". Over an acoustic guitar, co-vocalist Toby Leaman sings so ragged you can practically hear the walls of the B-room, and his life, closing in around him. ""Broken Heart"" is another lesson in restraint, straying from its tight, chugging clip for only the most emphatic of Dr. Dog's signature jaw-popping harmonies.</p>
<p>But it's still hard for Dr. Dog to break out of their decade-plus mold. The closest anyone came was on 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14089-shame-shame/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shame, Shame</i></a>, arguably their strongest effort to date. Producer Rob Schnapf (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2148-islands/"">Islands</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a>) and guest vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25867-jim-james/"">Jim James</a> helped buff the band's motley mass appeal until it shone through the album's brassy builds and sing-along choruses, utilizing the energy of six musicians to the fullest. Without outside direction, however, Dr. Dog quickly go back to their old ways. Afrobeat specialists Antibalas provide the horns on <i>B-Room</i>, but their talents are wasted on songs like ""Long Way Down"", the beginning of which sounds like the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_76RK_5bBs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Wayne's World</i> dissolve</a> tuned to a baritone sax. It shows some musical curiosity on Dr. Dog's part, for sure, but the track references <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16268-be-the-void/"" target=""_blank""><i>Be the Void</i></a>'s heavy-handed experimentalism—which also finds a way into the twinkly, Theremin-laced ballad ""Twilight""—more than anything else.</p>
<p>Around the time <i>Be the Void</i> came out, McMicken <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/articles/dr-dogs-scott-mcmicken,70518/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told the <i>AV Club</i></a>, ""Why be influenced by Dr. Dog? Why not just be influenced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>?"" Good question. There's nothing at all wrong with jamming and selling out shows and <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/drdogmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">custom leather items</a>, but if you don't believe your music adds anything to the conversation, it's fair to ask what the point is. Most music is by nature derivative, but that doesn't mean it has to be. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"" target=""_blank"">Foxygen</a>, for example, though much younger than Dr. Dog, manage to find ways to make the same decades-old pop and rock'n'roll new and exciting. Whether their music endures in the same way remains to be seen, but McMicken makes it sound like Dr. Dog has already given up on that possibility. And that's too bad, because it seems at one point they were as hungry as the Beatles and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">the Rolling Stones</a>: on ""Rock &amp; Roll,"" Leaman sings, ""Who’da known/ That it would be rock and roll/ That would terrify and eat me/ That would haunt me so completely?""

For six weeks at this artist space on the border between Alberta and British Columbia, the composer filled pages with arrangements, took afternoon walks up the mountain, and came down to blacken the pages some more.</p>
<p>In that isolated environment, with years of classical training, inspiration from working with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly"" target=""_blank"">Nico Muhly</a>, and a playlist that included the avant pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens"">Sufjan Stevens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors"">Dirty Projectors</a>, Ludwig-Leone's ideas started to only fit on grand scales. The final score for his debut required over 20 players, including a string quartet, a brass quartet, a vibraphone, and operatic sopranos. Coupled with inspiration from Hemingway's <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> (Ludwig-Leone grabbed the name ""San Fermin"" from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Ferm%C3%ADn"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">famous Pamplona festival</a> where they hold the Running of the Bulls), William Henry Hudson romance novels, and the self-imposed profundity that comes with being an anxious love-lorn 22-year-old college graduate, <i>San Fermin</i> arrives as an ambitious chamber pop debut. It’s a loose concept album that grazes, and sometimes dives into the complexities of young love, and slips in and out of dreams that often are just as absurd as the idea of a relationship actually working out.</p>
<p>Ludwig-Leone wrote lyrics for the baritone voice of Allen Tate, as well as the breathy sopranos of Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig of the band Lucius. The three interweave parts across the album, trading off leads, and joining back together for ornate duets. Some initial thoughts may run to how much Tate sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>'s Matt Berninger, not just in register, but in cadence, inflection, and sometimes lyrics. Or how Wolfe and Laessig’s whispery, hyper-accurate voices recall the women in Dirty Projectors' tight harmonies as well as the kind of choirs used on<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7514-illinois"" target=""_blank""> Illinois</a>.</i> The mosaic of sounds on <i>San Fermin</i> align with much of what has often been done before in chamber pop and indie, and on a song-by-song basis there’s plenty of side-eyeing. But the album works best as a cycle, as a series of movements rather than individual songs.</p>
<p><span>In that regard, Ludwig-Leone’s world, imbued with a fanciful style that balances the pop and the obtuse, <span>is very much his own</span>. The two “characters” Leone created are representations of ideologies, with Tate’s low voice handling the maudlin pleas and Wolfe and Laessig working together as his dry, world-weary counterweight. “I will tie to my body some roses/ I will fly till I get you alive” Tate sings on “Methuselah” an early-morning acoustic ballad in the first half of the album. It’s a bit much, but soon enough the female character undercuts the purple prose: She’s introduced with the line “I wouldn’t worry/ Your melodramas are embarrassing” on the aptly named “Crueler Kind”.</span></p>
<p>The conversation between the two places <i>San Fermin</i> directly in the current of high-stakes love. At its most turbulent, Ludwig-Leone writes palms-up climaxes deftly executed at three tentpoles on the album: the early highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15457-san-fermin-sonsick"" target=""_blank"">“Sonsick”</a>, the finale <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15889-daedalus-what-we-have/"" target=""_blank"">“Deadalus (What We Have)”</a>, and the beating heart of the album, “Bar”. Of all the exalting pleas for emotional catharsis, “Bar” is by far the most successful. On the track, the thrill between the two is like ""a drug in the arm/ makes you weak when you’re young,"" a line that's sung in a thick blanket of harmonies between the singers. It’s one of those perfect 21st Century indie arena songs, the kind you play through your iPhone with a crush, the ear buds split between the two of you while you watch fireworks go off in the distance. That said, when you hear Tate sing “Dead of the night/ I’m alone with the tigers” you might have a difficult time not also hearing “It’s a terrible love/ and I’m walking with spiders.”</p>
<p>Hiding around the three peaks are several interludes, and it's in these mini neoclassical compositions that Ludwig-Leone really shines. The pieces offer a rest from the broad-spectrum emotions found in the proper songs, also texturing the album with more curious sounds like spitting cellos, a xylophone under dissonant string drones, and a surprise crackling of a faulty synth patch. They manage to cut down some of the weight of the sung pieces, casting them in a more unique light, while giving <i>San Fermin</i><span> much needed tension and even a bit of violence.</span></p>
<p>The menagerie of baroque sounds on the album can be a bit more decorative than purposeful, but under the brambles, it's really just a story of two people wrestling with the love that exists between them. <span>There’s a recurring phrase peppered throughout <i>San Fermin</i>, something about falling asleep in someone’s arms. It’s hard to say exactly what happens to these two people in the end, as the album closes with a ghostly Gustav Mahler-type epilogue that leaves both the music and the story unresolved, but <i>San Fermin</i> is less about a narrative plot and more about abstract ideas and those lucid dreams that happen just before sleep.<br/></span></p></div>"|18500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18500-san-fermin-san-fermin/|7.4|Jeremy D.

But while you could easily tag dozens of different acts under everything from darkwave to acid house to trip-hop, real-life couple Sara Taylor and Ryan George, aka Los Angeles' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31456-youth-code/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Youth Code</a>, are one of only a precious few reviving industrial-thrashed electronic body music. Though they're not shy about their influences-- everything from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny_Puppy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skinny Puppy</a> to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_Trax"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wax Trax! Records</a> are evident touchstones of inspiration for the confrontational music the pair make-- it doesn't make them genre purists. On their <a href=""http://youthcode.bandcamp.com/album/youth-code"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled full-length debut</a>, Youth Code infuse their hellish soundscapes with elements of melodic coldwave, charging power electronics, and even hardcore. The result is both uncompromising and consuming, suggesting the ""body"" in their EBM was formed in an early <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000343/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cronenberg</a> film: Disfigured, mutant, and grossly compelling.<br/><br/>Youth Code have only being recording for a little over a year, but their chops suggest the work of a more informed and consistent outfit. Chalk it up to studious ears and hard work: Taylor works as a tour manager, George has bummed around in various different punk and hardcore bands, and both eschew the constrictions of ""scenes"" while committing themselves to DIY ethics. A recent list the pair drummed-up for <a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled</a> magazine, titled <a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/2013/09/11/youth-codes-top-10-industrial-songs-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-nine-inch-nails/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Youth Code's Top Ten Industrial Songs That Have Nothing To Do With Nine Inch Nails,""</a> showcased their curious blend of influences and disinterest in convention. A <a href=""http://youthcode.bandcamp.com/album/demonstrational-cassette"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cassette</a> released last December translated those ideas well, despite sounding uncomfortably shrill thanks to its homemade quality (three of those tracks have been re-recorded for the LP). With <i>Youth Code</i>, everything is about depth, the corroded atmospheres and indelicate but fierce percussive elements. Though it's short, it's a brutal listen, like being brained with a fire extinguisher in the middle of a nitrous hit. Exhausting, surely, but there's a propulsion and a warped tunefulness on display that keeps you on your toes, even if Taylor and George didn't intend that to be taken literally.<br/><br/>For as violent and caustic as Youth Code is, there's also balance. Their hardware sounds rusted and cranky, but the variety of sounds the two are able to conjure-- gunshot snare cracks, boiler room clankings, rubbery synths, metal-on-metal-- keeps the slavish 4/4 tempos engaging. And while it's no one's idea of a traditional dance record, there's no denying that Taylor and George are beat freaks, keeping rhythms insistent and corporeal. The strobe-lit highlight ""Carried Mask""'s elevated heart rate and ping-ponging synths sounds like something a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5657-crystal-castles/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Castles</a> fan could relate to, while ""What Is the Answer"" is almost like some kind of demented funk exercise. Everything here taps into a sort of dystopian feel, like a Satanic reimagining of Brad Fiedel's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPqklOAojD0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Terminator 2</i> score</a>, all skulls and twisted metal and flames as far as the eye can see.<br/><br/>If this all seems a little over-the-top, it's because it is-- Youth Code don't really do subtle, but their full commitment to these theatrics is what makes the music work. Opener ""Let the Sky Burn"" is a harrowing introduction, complimented by George's putrid, strangulated screams and spoken word snippets from downer newscasts (""We have an obligation to every last victim of this illegal aggression, because all this carnage has been done in our name,"" a woman vows, making everything about the track-- right down to its title-- chillingly timely). Still, <i>Youth Code</i> isn't completely impervious to familiar trappings. Thanks to those rigid tempos, monotony is bound to set in. And though repetition is part of its hammering appeal, things eventually begin to grey a bit as the record moves on, losing the punch of the pure blacks and neon reds of the first half. And though those spoken word samples that pepper the album do more obstructing than enhancing, there's no hampering Youth Code's intentions. ""I love pop music but at the end of the day I know we're not going to write a fucking pop record,"" <a href=""http://www.idieyoudie.com/2013/09/an-interview-with-youth-code/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taylor recently told I Die You Die</a>.

They made three very solid records that explored a small handful of musical ideas and those records seemed to say all the group had to to say. In that sense (and a few others—both were on Rough Trade in 1991), they bring to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a>, another band that created slow, expansive, and gorgeously atmospheric music. In each case, their brief arc was complete; for anyone interested in that Mazzy Star feeling, <i>She Hangs Brightly</i>, <i>So Tonight That I Might See</i>, and <i>Among My Swan</i> were still there, ready to provide a distinctive mix of of psych-tinged folk, blues, Laurel Canyon glide, and Hope Sandoval’s captivating voice, which expressed hushed, lean-in intimacy and aloof distance simultaneously. In the years since, the sound of those albums proved surprisingly influential, though in an appropriately small-scale way, and that influence crested in the last few years. Mazzy Star may have benefited retroactively from a renewed interest in the darkly sexy side of David Lynch’s aesthetic; their first three records captured that feeling perfectly and artists from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29704-widowspeak/"" target=""_blank"">Widowspeak</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a> have offered variations on that particular theme.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">But they did come back, and unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18482-sebadoh-defend-yourself/"">recent</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18560-pixies-ep-1/"">records</a> from other bands that made their names in the 1980s and 90s, they haven’t lost a thing in the interim. <i>Seasons of Your Day</i> is so faithful to Mazzy Star’s established sound and is rendered so perfectly that it’s almost hard to believe. There is no sign of age or intrusion of an additional influence; if word emerged that this record was actually recorded in 1997, a year after the release of <i>Among My Swan</i>, there would be no reason to doubt it. The tone and phrasing of Sandoval’s voice are exactly where we left them when Bill Clinton was seeking a second term as President. The slide guitar, brushed drums, and tambourine hits are all recorded beautifully, and there is enough space around every element to suggest a lack of sonic trickery. </p>
<p class=""p1"">David Roback, Mazzy Star’s musical driving force and a veteran of 1980s L.A. bands from Rain Parade to Opal, hasn’t been in the public eye since <i>Among My Swan</i>, but whatever he’s been up to, he remembers how to make a record sound good and how to write simple and effective chord changes. The craftsmanship of the songs—their mix of longing, weary resignation, and dusty cracks of sunlight—remains at a high level. To hear this Mazzy Star record is to understand why the modest and enjoyable Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions never really took off; Roback studied the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>, and Jagger/Richards in their prime, and he’s retained those lessons all these years later. The reverb forming a halo around Sandoval’s voice on “California” is warm and haunted, Roback’s guitar tone on “Common Burn” is impossibly lonesome and beautiful, and the acoustic slide imparting a sense of “Wild Horses” blusiness on “Sparrow” and “Does Someone Have Your Baby Now” cuts through yawning canyons of silence. The record is sonically impressive in an elemental way, and the songs are memorable and distinct. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But if Mazzy Star have done amazingly well bringing back their initial sound and spirit, they also haven’t done anything to transcend its limitations. As gorgeous as the music can be, it still tends to work best in the background, a mood or vibe to give a dim room a nice tint. “Fade Into You”, their one hit and the only song most of the world has heard by them, with its “Knocking on Heaven’s Door” progression and pronounced romantic ache, did manage to connect with a lot of people on a deeply emotional level, but that wasn't necessarily the point of Mazzy Star as a whole. There was always some remove to the project, a certain formalism; still, to my ear, none of these qualities detract from what makes Mazzy Star so listenable and appealing. Those first three albums have always been easy to put on and enjoy, and now we have a fourth to go with them. </p></div>"|18533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18533-mazzy-star-seasons-of-your-day/|7.8|Mark Richardson

Their patterned musical figures and calmly rendered vocal lines create a sense of pleasant remove from their subject matter, which is usually devotion. Smoothing down charged emotions with something between plucky self-control and spooky disassociation, Erika Forster, Annie Hart, and Heather D'Angelo can seem all the more ghostly for how they blend together on record, which gives their most private and personal sentiments an airy, collective tinge of the afterlife. But while staying that course for the last decade, the trio has cautiously let more irregularity and individuality creep into their electronic dream pop. The process of letting go accelerates on their most raucous album to date, <i>Move in Spectrums</i>, their first since drifting apart after 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13000-still-night-still-light/""><i>Still Night, Still Light</i></a>.</p>
<p>The title of Au Revoir Simone's debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9182-verses-of-comfort-assurance-salvation/""><i>Verses of Comfort, Assurance &amp; Salvation</i></a>, summed up the candidly inspirational milieu of their first two records and, to a lesser extent, their pivotal third one. <i>Verses</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9941-the-bird-of-music/""><i>The Bird of Music</i></a> set sentimental homilies against toy-like sounds, striking a balance between innocent sweetness and unnerving detachment that <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/5393124/David-Lynchs-darlings-Au-Revoir-Simone.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">caught the ear</a> of someone who perfected the blend, David Lynch. But with <i>Still Night, Still Light</i>, a change took hold. The band grew a dance music spine, the drum machines pounding as often as spritzing, and their lyrical themes grew more downcast and mature, if still couched in consoling tones. Their music had always felt like a nocturnal illumination, but now it evoked neon flashes on dark city streets more than a nightlight, with the worldliness of electro-pop displacing the formative influences of the baby's mobile, the lullaby, the music box.</p>
<p>After spending several years working on other projects and regrouping, Au Revoir Simone pick up that leveler gaze where it left off on <i>Move in Spectrums</i>. Even fans of <i>Still Night</i> might be surprised by the hefty black synthesizer that opens the record, a far cry from the group’s origins in sparkling lightness. Throughout, their drum machine programming, which used to tend toward a compact fizz, is spacious and storm-lashed, roiling with grayscale tones.  The music strays into some thin atmosphere during the home stretch, but before that it feels stronger and more driven than ever before. The record is frontloaded with its best pop looks: ""More Than"" demonstrates a new vocal mobility and freedom, oscillating powerfully between a bare <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Georgia Hubley</a>-like murmur and  a scrambling unison chorus; ""The Lead is Galloping"" has the commanding icy patina of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>; and album highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15903-crazy/"">""Crazy""</a> bolts along on a stuttering electric note with a bouncy vocal delivery worthy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"">Tracyanne Campbell</a>.</p>
<p>The synth that simulates a guitar is most prominent, in delayed glassy shards, on the down-tempo ""We Both Know"", which represents the best of the album's more pensive side. The sluggish attack and slow tom rolls of ""Boiling Point"" begin a gentle unraveling of the music's seams. ""Love You Don’t Know Me"" cycles one lyric over little more than naturalistic piano tones and a loose snare, and feels more like running out of ideas than profound understatement. More engagingly, ""Hand Over Hand"" runs a notched synth note through rough silk chords, though the drums from earlier in the record are missed. But this low-impact stretch perks up with the svelte dance-pop of ""Just Like a Tree"",  the soulful and joyous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15668-somebody-who/"">""Somebody Who""</a>, and especially ""Gravitron"", which feels like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a> personalized for Au Revoir Simone's more intimate world. Dramatic and driving, it never quite escapes the upper atmosphere, though thick loopy synth shapes provide an ample climax, showing how this band can go bigger without forsaking its cloistered center.        </p></div>"|18514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18514-au-revoir-simone-move-in-spectrums/|7.3|Brian Howe

Wong took a similar approach during his time with Baltimore art punks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5037-ponytail/"">Ponytail</a>, although that band had a greater sense of abandon than his more studied output on his own. <i>Mediation of Ecstatic Energy</i> is the latest LP in a rapid-fire set of releases that have come from him since the dissolution of his former band. It's the second record from him this year, following his collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2776-takako-minekawa/"">Takako Minekawa</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18005-takako-minekawa-dustin-wong-tropical-circle/""><i>Toropical Circle</i></a>, and the third part in a trilogy of albums that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14802-infinite-love/""><i>Infinite Love</i></a> (2010) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16314-dreams-say-view-create-shadow-leads/""><i>Dreams Say, View, Create, Shadow Leads</i></a> (2012). The intent of the trilogy is somewhat muddy; it's billed as an adventure in ""advanced solo guitar looping techniques,"" a description that could apply to most of the work Wong has released to date.</p>
<p>It's best not to think too hard on how all this hangs together with his prior recordings, as mostly it comes across as a natural extension of ideas Wong has carefully advanced on for many years. If there is an underlying theme, it's in the way he appears fascinated with pairing natural and unnatural sounds, matching winsome strumming with shards of robo-noise, all pulled out of the same instrument. Ponytail had a vast rhythmic sway that sucked audiences right into their sound, largely thanks to drummer Jeremy Hyman's incredible pounding. But here Wong retreats from that, sometimes setting his songs to a backing so stiff it's positively claustrophobic, further emphasizing the machine-like rigidity he takes to some of his guitar playing. It serves to heighten the lighter feel that blooms when he's free to wander in less densely layered material-- ""Imaginelectric"" is a bright burst of air after the dense ""Emerald Atmosphere"".</p>
<p>Something that's notable here and on Wong's other solo efforts is the sense of play involved, a feeling that his cross-stitched guitar lines are inducing a form of giddy mania. The intro to ""Out of the Crown Head"" is ridiculously labyrinthian, although it's thrilling to see him pull himself out of there, untying all the work he's done to build into some kind of alien approximation of a sea shanty. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6049-robert-fripp/"">Robert Fripp</a> comes to mind at times, although a more unlikely comparison is the glorious stop-start robotics of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"">Devo</a>. It's there in the awkward, metallic edges of ""Liberal Christian Youth Ministry"", where every part is treated as a block of sound that precisely slots together. There are no smooth transitions in Wong's world, no natural bridges from verse to chorus. Instead, it's the guitar equivalent of watching a logjam on the freeway, with escape seeming ever more distant with every new element added to the mix.</p>
<p>Thought has clearly been put into the sequencing of <i>Mediation of Ecstatic Energy</i>. The formula roughly goes: guitars gradually amassing like a dust storm, moments of brittle tension, a soft release into breezy territory (repeat). Everything comes close to implosion on the centerpiece ""(A) shows (B) his analysis and (C) looked over"", with rhythms collapsing and Wong appearing to have forgotten where he is entirely at one point. This album could have used a few more moments like that-- times where chops are thrown out of the window and a more reckless approach settles in. Instead, Wong occasionally cross-references himself a little too closely, recycling ideas from ""Emerald Atmospheres"" on ""Physical Consciousness Went In"". Maybe that's his sense of play at work again. After all, an album about loops wouldn't be complete if it didn’t loop back on itself at some point.</p></div>"|18434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18434-dustin-wong-meditation-of-ecstatic-energy/|6.8|Nick Neyland

""We Want to Parrty, Parrty, Parrty"" was sampled on Charli Baltimore's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwPgyLGMWLk#t=152"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stand Up</a>"". Chicago juke icon <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30360-traxman/"" target=""_blank"">Traxman</a> samples ""Parrty"" too, on <i>Teklife Vol. 3: The Architek</i>, a double album for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Rashad</a>'s Lit City Trax label and Teklife. He turns its harmless imperative, ""Hey you! Blow your whistle!,"" into a barked command; by the end of the track, I'm tired of being yelled at.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Traxman's record collection is purportedly renowned amongst Chicago locals; he's been DJing house and juke and hip-hop for more than three decades. Obscurity, though, is not his game. Last year's <i>Da Mind of Traxman</i> featured AC/DC's ""Let There Be Rock"" amongst its absurd and hamfisted appropriations. <i>The Architek</i> makes hay with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"" target=""_blank"">Juicy J</a> (""Off Them Bars"", exactly what you would expect) and, hilariously, Michael Jackson's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAi3VTSdTxU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Earth Song</a>"", flipping the song's one ominous line-- ""What about killing fields?""-- into nearly four minutes of eerie, melodic paranoia.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's not the sample, it's how you use it. But Traxman albums are not for trainspotters: the train is 30 yards away, barreling down the tracks at you (blowing its whistle). Where DJ Rashad and RP Boo are menacing and soulful, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29787-dj-diamond/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Diamond</a> is concerned with breaking rhythmic barriers, Traxman's guilelessness adds warmth and jes to his records. He's the footwork artist most willing to abandon the genre's hyper-rhythmic backbone to explore cheese and glitz. Elements of acid house, juke, and drum &amp; bass meet schlock-pop, glam, and rap.  </p>
<p>His tracks tend to conform to one of two templates: heavily deployed vocal samples over sparse drums and more intense, wordless rhythm attacks. Some of his most thrilling moments fall into the latter category. ""Japan"" utilizes a sparse beat and aquatic bass to underpin a wild, staccato squeak. ""Manic"" features a long, undulating synthesizer jam. Like last year's ""1988"", ""Mobile Acid"" reveals acid house roots, taking an already warped bassline and turning it over on itself until it's a mound of refried goo. ""Electric Funk""'s deranged beeps sound like Shangaan electro retrofitted to Chicago juke.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's those vocal samples that serve as signposts on <i>The Architek</i>, though, like the James Brown-sampling, DJ Rashad-collaboration ""Bussin"" or the self-mythologizing DJ shoutout ""We Takin' Over"". ""Hold It"", a longtime footwork favorite, samples a large swath of Psycho's title theme and adds a short, shrill vocal sample-- ""Hold it!""-- over the top. The combination doesn't make a lot of sense, musically or thematically, but it succeeds at feeling both familiar and alien.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The middle of ""Blow Your Whistle"" features another short Collins sample. Traxman nabs her count-in to the track-- ""1! 2! 3! 4!""-- and slices into a wild, disorienting breakdown. It's as fine a summation of Traxman's sound-- blurring the line between voice and rhythm-- as you're likely to find. At 21 tracks, <i>The Architek</i> is overlong and not always engrossing, but its range and confidence are impressive, further cementing Traxman as footwork's mischievous, elusive virtuoso.</p></div>"|18536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18536-traxman-teklife-vol-3-the-architek/|7.3|Andrew Gaerig

After releasing a demo like that, the trick is to capture the ephemeral, flighty buzz, harness it to your oxcart, and ride it off into the sunset with robust first week album sales and panting reviews streaming behind you. With the Flenser's release of their proper debut LP <i>12 Minutes</i>, Loss of Self almost accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate <i>12 Minutes</i> surfaced the same year Deafheaven deftly scooped up the “post-black metal” crown, because the comparisons are inevitable. The shimmering chords, the expansive post-rock melodies, the sly nods towards depressive Cascadian riffs-- it’s all here. True, Loss of Self are more in tune with their black metal side than many of the other post-punk/black metal hybrids floating around. The vocals never veer from their vehement rasp, first dredged up on album opener “Paradise Overgrown”, a song that comes across as a genuinely strange, dissonant affair. (Here, they sound like a group that could care less about Joy Division, but have heard good things about Deathspell Omega.)</p>
<p>The pretty parts join the party just in time for “Isolt”, where despite its ragged shrieks and wild tremolo, the joyful noise forces its way through. The post-punk influence is unapologetic; nearly every song has at least a few threads of lithe, bright melody weaving through. No, it’s not a very grim record in any sense of the word. The title track, for instance, is a rich, layered piece that piles on clouds of cottony fuzz and, if one were to ignore the strangled vocals, would sound altogether happy. And while Loss of Self keep their motives quiet, the baleful negativity that permeates the majority of their brethren is absent. (Is this what positive black metal sounds like? Other writers have coined the phrase, and they may just be onto something here: “There Must Be Great Wisdom with Great Death” sounds positively ecstatic.)</p>
<p>The cryptically titled “( )” is a windswept ambient interlude, spanning only two minutes. Loss of Self are unique amongst their fellows in this regard: the songs they write never pass the four minute mark, but manage to pack so many ideas and dollops of atmosphere into every moment that the listener never feels cheated. It’s a valuable skill, especially given the oft-ignored truth that not every riff really needs nine minutes to loiter about. The bizarrely distorted reptilian vocals on “The Free Intelligence” create a jarring chorus with the omnipresent croaks. Coupled with the jumpy drumbeats and skittering riff, it makes for a wobbly, disorienting listen, like playing <i>Transilvanian Hunger</i> through the blown-out stereo in your beat-up high school car.</p>
<p>After this, the new material ends, and our barely cooled memories of the demo’s three tracks are refreshed, re-recorded and spiffed up. The slow, somber “The Inheritance” is plaintive and cold, its startlingly lovely central riff moving along at a dejected pace. Tellingly, it’s still the band’s strongest track, even when held up against the final two demo songs. The promise they first made to us in 2012 is still there, half-met. Despite their disparity, none of the tracks seem to develop a very distinct sound; it blurs together charmingly enough, but there’s not much that really grabs hold. Loss of Self have potential to create something truly great, but they might need just a little more time to get it together.</p></div>"|18329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18329-loss-of-self-12-minutes/|6.0|Kim Kelly

""This is a song about how much we like making out with people!"" she and bandmate Aino Jawo declared, practically in unison, with the triumphant and outsized exuberance of a pair of Olympians who have just won an unexpected gold medal. The song is called ""Then We Kiss"", a thumping, hyperactive new-wave sunburst that concludes the Swedish duo's full-length debut, <i>This Is…Icona Pop</i>, a collection of cranked-up, EDM-influenced pop that sounds like a cross between ABBA's <i>Gold</i> and Andrew WK's <i>I Get Wet</i>. ""Then We Kiss"" is a perfect closer-- the kind of song to the tune of which balloons and confetti fall out of rafters-- and its final, chanted lines (""All I wanna do is have a good time"") serve as a succinct summary of the 32 minutes that have come before. The only thing Icona Pop take seriously is fun, which is to say that they don't take anything very seriously at all.</p>
<p>Of course, the song that elevated Icona Pop from plastic to gold kazoo status is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13584-i-love-it/"">""I Love It""</a>, the hard-driving, rainbow-brite break-up anthem that was first (and, initially, quietly) released as a single in May 2012. The song's life has been fascinating, if not downright myth-busting. In a moment when it seems like the internet has killed off the very notion of a monoculture, it became an unavoidable global hit (it just went double-platinum in the U.S.); in a moment when it seemed our pop cultural attention spans were dwindling to nothing, its star burned slowly enough to make it a Song of the Summer contender two years in a row. ""I Love It"" has pinballed across the zeitgeist with anarchic glee. It has been covered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51453-are-you-ready-to-hear-titus-andronicus-cover-icona-pops-i-love-it-for-eight-minutes/"">Titus Andronicus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51796-watch-cookie-monster-takes-on-icona-pops-i-love-it-on-sesame-street/"">Cookie Monster</a>; it has soundtracked a scene of coke-addled dancing on <i>Girls</i> and one of primetime network pomp on <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>. The last time I watched the video for ""I Love It"", I first had to sit through a 30-second ad that was soundtracked by ""I Love It"".</p>
<p>To the cynical, this might read like Chapter 1 of a one hit wonder story, and usually these aren't the sort of circumstances under which an artist releases a debut of consistent quality, or sets the foundation for a long career. But <i>This Is…Icona Pop</i> is a pleasant surprise: it's something more than just 11 tracks of padding around an undeniable hit. ""I Love It"" kicks things off (as it did last year's spirited yet spotty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17247-the-iconic-ep/""><i>Iconic</i> </a>EP), but in sequence-- somewhat improbably-- it's not so much an early burn-out as it is the spark that launches the rest of the album's propulsive run.</p>
<p>Given that Icona Pop’s preferred theme is turning lemons into (hard) lemonade, they could not have a more perfect origin story. The two met at a party when each was rising from the ashes of her own respective misfortune: Jawo had just been dumped, and Hjelt had just recovered from a prolonged leg injuring sustained by, <a href=""http://www.purevolume.com/news/icona-pop-caroline-hjelt-interview-2013"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in her words</a>, ""jumping on a trampoline after beer pong."" Their connection was immediate and electric; they wrote their first song the next day. Though their debut album finds them working with an assortment of co-writers and producers (including Norweigan hitmakers Stargate and Swedish producer Patrik Berger), the palpable chemistry between Hjelt and Jawo is the engine driving Icona Pop's sound. Their voices-- much more often entwined than solo-- blare forcefully enough to compete with (and often overpower) the songs' pounding beats and throbbing synths, but this over-exerted quality also gives their music a certain human warmth. ""Voices have to crack a little for it to sound like two people,"" Hjelt said <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/icona-pop-looks-to-prove-its-more-than-just-i-love-it-on-debut-album/2013/09/23/afdec2fe-246f-11e3-b3e9-d97fb087acd6_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a recent interview</a>, nailing the essence <i>This Is…Icona Pop</i>'s scrappy, collaborative charm. File it under ""bestie-core.""</p>
<p><span>Icona Pop's best songs are the ones that tightrope-walk the line between good and bad taste-- that own their gaucheness confidently enough to transform it into glory.</span><span> The strobe-light pulse of ""We Got the World"" pushes an anthemic melody into the red (Icona Pop usually sing like people who will wake up with sore throats tomorrow), while the irresistibly goofy ""On a Roll"" sounds like something Electric Six would write for the Eurovision Song Contest (""You go with me/ There will not be drinking of tea/ Huh!""). The plot of ""On A Roll"" revolves around the unbelievable luck of finding a ""brand new, crispy"" $100 bill on the ground; in an Icona Pop song this is more than enough money to have a good time. </span><i>This Is…</i><span> embraces the spirit of glam, but it's not music about the acquisition of wealth (imagine if every song on American radio were written by artists from countries with near-utopian levels of income equality) or acquisition of anything long-term, really. (""You and I live, don’t learn,"" they proclaim on ""We Got the World"", ""Every day we fire it up and let it burn."") Like most great party music, Icona Pop's euphoria is mixed with a twinge of apocalypse, like the soundtrack to a house party where the world ends before you have to separate the trash from the recycling.</span></p>
<p><span>The first seven songs play out like a 20-minute power hour, but the album loses a bit of steam after that. Clumsy lyrics (""Close my eyes and we're still naked/ But then I see that my clock is changing"") are always harder to forgive when they're caked in melodrama, so the sub-Journey power ballad ""Just Another Night"" lands with a thud. Similarly, the electro-reggae number ""Light Me Up"" is, as you might guess from the title, a little too on-the-nose. But luckily Icona Pop get it back in the end with ""Then We Kiss"", a song that calls to mind the sleek, luminous pair of neo-new-wave songs that Ric Ocasek produced on No Doubt's </span><i>Rock Steady</i><span>. ""Then We Kiss"" barely exceeds two minutes, but it strays just far enough from the formula to suggest that Icona Pop might have more than one trick up their sleeves. On a debut, though, they can get by without showing much range.</span></p>
<p>The closest Icona Pop come to matching the endorphin-drunk perfection of ""I Love It"" is ""Girlfriend"", a beaming synth-pop anthem that plays out like Robyn’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv644ipg2Ss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Call Your Girlfriend""</a> might if the girls in that song both decided to dump their cheating dude and<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzBmQMyYDBk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> become best friends</a> instead. Some might dismiss it as Girl Power recycled for generation EDM, but unlike the Spice Girls, Icona Pop actually seem to like each other in real life. ""All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend,"" Hjelt and Jawo sing, reimagining Tupac’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjAta8xLg3M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sensitive thug theme song</a> as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5030-sugababes/"">suga-coated</a> ode to female solidarity. A little over the top? Sure. But coming from the group who coined post-guilty-pleasure pop's<a href=""http://rock.rapgenius.com/Icona-pop-i-love-it-lyrics#note-1960717"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> most quotable slogan</a>, we should expect nothing less.</p></div>"|18529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18529-icona-pop-this-is-icona-pop/|7.5|Lindsay Zoladz

One is a bedroom project that mostly makes minimalist, experimental, drum-machine-backed EPs and split singles. The other is a full rock band that makes full rock albums, with drums provided by former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>, Prong, and Godflesh member Ted Parsons. Both are led by Justin Broadrick-- co-founder of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5443-napalm-death/"" target=""_blank"">Napalm Death</a> and Godflesh, as well as numerous side projects. What ties both versions of Jesu together is Broadrick’s wide-angle vision: a melodic yet abstracted amalgam of industrialized metal and time-lapse shoegaze. Until now it’s been pretty easy to know which Jesu you were getting, simply by noting if the release in question were an EP or an album. But on Jesu’s fifth full-length, <i>Everyday I Get Closer to the Light From Which I Came</i>, that distinction is not so strict. Neither is Broadrick’s normally high standard.</p>
<p>Clocking in at five songs, <i>Everyday I Get Closer </i>is the skimpiest Jesu full-length to date (not counting the single-cut, fifty-minute <i>Infinity </i>from 2009, which is neither EP fish nor album fowl). The tracks vary greatly in span, but beyond that there’s not as much of a dynamic as on prior Jesu full-lengths. Granted, Jesu has long been one of those great, every-song-sounds-the-same kind of endeavors, although a deeper immersion in any given Jesu disc reveals rich degrees of emotional engagement and layers of textured ambience. On top of that, Broadrick has been turning into a stunning singer-songwriter, a kind of British <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1307-mark-eitzel/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Eitzel</a> buried under metric tons of celestial distortion. Few of these strengths are in abundance on <i>Everyday I Get Closer</i>. On “Homesick”, Broadrick’s trademark use of descending chord progressions is executed in his sleep, as is the Swervedriver-ish swirl and chiming counterpoint. There’s an afterimage of longing that haunts the song, but it never clicks into focus. Nor does the 17-minute, would-be saga that is “The Great Leveller”, which drifts from movement to movement-- piano-laced intro, planetoid riffs, antigravity interludes, the low-cycle hum of synthesized melancholy-- in an anticlimactic meander.</p>
<p>That’s not to say <i>Everyday I Get Closer </i>is a bust. Even when treading water, it walks on air. The ambient lead-in to “Comforter” seeps like a ruptured cloud into atmospheric passages of oscillating noise, tectonic bass, and a collage of reverberating vocal samples. When Broadrick steps out from behind his shimmering, digitized curtain to lend his angelic deadpan to the song’s sad churn, it morphs from a lullaby to a lament. His voice is even more vulnerable on “Everyday”, where pounding rhythms-- reminiscent of <i>Hymns</i>-era Godflesh, Broadrick’s bridge into Jesu-- tether a gradual escalation of stratified guitar and interstellar pinging. It doesn’t come close to the orchestral sprawl of “The Great Leveller”, but it’s stronger because of its conciseness, not to mention a much-needed display of self-humanization in which Broadrick lets his lungs hang out.</p>
<p>And then he goes and recuses himself-- or at least his vocal presence-- from the halfhearted instrumental closer “Grey is the Color”. An angular, space-punctured approach to slowcore that imagines Codeine gone kosmische, it’s an emptily pleasant, mildly numbing wisp of filler. It’s also the only thing Broadrick leaves the listener holding. It shouldn’t make a difference whether a release is called an album or an EP-- only in Jesu’s case, each new album is a rare event that crystallizes the aching, creeping progress Broadrock makes between EPs. Despite its respectable length, <i>Everyday I Get Closer</i> is not one of those events. Instead it drifts in listless circles, waiting maybe too patiently for the other, mightier Jesu to come along.</p></div>"|18534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18534-jesu-everyday-i-get-closer-to-the-light/|6.8|Jason Heller

But even in their heyday, Girls Against Boys were used to being the odd men out. Though they had roots in the D.C. Dischord scene and enjoyed a three-album run on Chicago’s Touch &amp; Go Records, this uncommonly handsome band always projected a cool suavity-- like the Rat Pack taking up residency at the 9:30 Club-- that distinguished them from more outrageous post-hardcore peers like the Jesus Lizard and Brainiac, while lead mouthpiece Scott McCloud favored a sleazily suggestive crypto-speak at odds with the more earnest invectives of contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2171-jawbox/"" target=""_blank"">Jawbox</a>. And they were putting their own singular spin on then-dormant ’80s post-punk influences-- namely, the pint-glass-smashing rumble of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"" target=""_blank"">the Fall</a> and the icy pulse of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>-- long before you could score an <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> t-shirt at Urban Outfitters.</p>
<p>But Girls Against Boys’ unconventional ethos yielded an all-too-predictable outcome: a momentum-stalling, instantly dated major-label debut (1998’s regrettably titled <i>Freak*On*Ica</i>), followed by an unceremonious return to indie-dom (2002’s <i>You Can’t Fight What You Can’t See</i>). Since then, the band’s individual members have ventured as far away from the House of GVSB as possible: McCloud and drummer Alexis Fleisig launched the acoustic-oriented, National-esque Paramount Styles, and bassist Johnny Temple turned his sideline indie-book imprint Akashic into a mini-publishing empire, while fellow four-stringer Eli Janney padded out his Nation of Ulysses and Jawbox production credits with the likes of Jet and James Blunt. So, in light of these highly divergent pursuits, it’s pretty remarkable that, on their first release in 11 years, Girls Against Boys manage to sound exactly like Girls Against Boys.</p>
<p>If anything’s changed here, it’s their perspective. On GVSB’s signature mid-90s releases, there was a considerable ironic distance between the band’s urbane, predatory sound and McCloud’s knowingly antiquated banter, which invested hoary show-biz phraseology (“One more time with feeling!” “Sock it to me!” “You’re in like Flynn!”) with lecherous menace. On <i>The Ghost List</i>, he’s still very much the cocktail-swilling cretin occupying the same corner stool, but his barfly philosophy has become more rueful with age: When he observes, “It’s a diamond life” (on the swaggering lead track of the same name), the luxe-lifestyle fantasies of old have hardened into post-recession desperation, and his repeated insistence that “you gotta get into it/ get into it” applies the sort of aspirational pressure that inspires one to max out their credit cards. And for a guy whose lyrics could read like a news-ticker of pick-up lines, the atypically confessional tone and melodic drive of “Let’s Get Killed” (“the past is all we live in and the future’s always slipping away”) suggests that McCloud’s looking for a connection that lasts longer than last call to breakfast. (Accordingly, during GVSB’s hiatus, he relocated to Vienna to live with his Austrian girlfriend.)</p>
<p>Consistent with the more sobering outlook, <i>The Ghost List</i> doesn’t quite push GVSB to peak white-hot intensity-- none of these five songs are as liable to incite a brawl like “Kill the Sexplayer” or soundtrack a drive-by like “Bulletproof Cupid"". And though GVSB were one of the few indie-rock bands in the 90s to take notes from concurrent developments in dance music, there’s no attempt here to contemporize the band’s sound. (As McCloud <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/music/girls-against-boys-reunites-will-perform-at-black-cat-anniversary-show/2013/09/11/240bd1da-164c-11e3-be6e-dc6ae8a5b3a8_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently told the <i>Washington Post</i></a>, this sense of arrested development was a totally intentional brass-tacks move.) But from the robo-cow-punk charge of “Fade Out” to the synth-buzzed pummel of “60 Is Greater Than 15” to the industrialized meltdown of “Kick"", <i>The Ghost List EP</i> is a successful reboot for a mothballed machine whose core components-- brawn, dissonance, and groove-- are shown to be still in fine working order. Sure, we’ve seen this movie before, but Girls Against Boys haven’t forgotten the good parts. </p></div>"|18525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18525-girls-against-boys-the-ghost-list/|7.0|Stuart Berman

They arrive stateside smelling of sunscreen and sativa a couple of months after their debut LP <i>Ages</i> was released in their home country on Arch Hill. For their U.S. and European release, the quartet partnered with New Zealand's storied <a href=""http://www.flyingnun.co.nz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flying Nun Records</a>, the provenance of many of the sounds that hover around Ghost Wave’s sunny psych-pop tunes. Led by singer/guitarist Matthew Paul, the quartet writes songs for a real summer’s summer, one of those idyllic ones you see in faded photos from the 60s with surfboards and oversized sunglasses. On <i>Ages</i>, there’s hardly a shadow, just propulsive garage-rock tunes, heaps of guitars, all mid-tempo everything. It’s able, often innovative, and certainly repetitive.</p>
<p>“Repetitive” usually isn’t a pejorative word in music-- especially in the garage/psych world, it’s either an aesthetic or a given-- but here it speaks to the ceaseless tone Ghost Wave strike on the record. They're comparable to some bands on <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>, who incidentally partnered with Flying Nun just before this release, making <i>Ages</i> the first record released on Flying Nun since the two joined forces. Captured Tracks serves as a good pivot point for Ghost Wave. On one side there’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/"" target=""_blank"">DIIV</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing"" target=""_blank"">Wild Nothing</a> living in the damp ethereal plane, focusing on the bluer strains of introverted thought. Then there's Ghost Wave, who conduct their business in the sun-- Matthew Paul wants all those road-trips and lazy afternoons spent smoking cigarettes in front of the gas station to stretch out like saltwater taffy. Half the time he’s shedding his many UK garage and Kiwi pop influences to carve out a real identity for Ghost Wave. The other half, he sounds as anonymous as their name.</p>
<p>It opens strongly, the first four songs working less like individual tracks and more like a four-part movement that carries you away on a wave of simple three-chord kraut grooves and saccharine, dudded-up garage rock. It’s all theme and recapitulation over the kind of minimalist forms their forebears <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean"">the Clean </a>and <i>Loaded</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Velvet Underground</a> minted (Clean member Thomas Bell engineered and mixed the record in Dunedin, NZ). It’s everywhere on “I Don’t Mind”, which slops around in a few blues riffs while Paul smirks out words often prefixed by a supremely cool “ooo” or “yeah.”</p>
<p>The song bleeds into the back-to-back album highlights, first with the escapist anthem “Country Rider”, a song that struts around a two chord jam that finds more and more guitars folding over each other. The other highlight, the five-minute instrumental “Arkestra”, serves more as a reprise of the previous song-- a continuation of a thought without dropping the energy. ""Arkestra"" defines the record’s plot: just keep on going. Paul’s songs often find him dissatisfied with stillness, so he gets eager when there’s girls coming, and spends time running not walking, shaking down empty streets, and getting out to the country. As the first half of the record comes to a close with a heavier “Marquee Moon” kind of jam, it feels like this trip could never end.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you get to the second half, it doesn’t. Ghost Wave get comfy in simplicity, tone, and tempo, and maintain that true course for the rest of the record. There’s a great, mid-60s Stones energy that runs underneath <i>Ages</i> that keeps the whole thing hearty and on its heels. But Paul’s faux-lysergic lyricism peppered throughout is never as focused as something like the Stones' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1kTuVSUOw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“19th Nervous Breakdown”</a>, even though he matches that jaunty cadence often. The clunky “Teenage Jesus” fades into the background just as “Bootlegs” did a few songs before it, and when they realign with the motorik groove on “Mountain”, it feels like they're activating a psych trope by rote as opposed to absorbing it as their own.</p>
<p>Like many fledgling, crate-digging bands still finding their way, Ghost Wave err on the side of caution, staying in their lane and avoiding ballads altogether. They hit their sweet spot so early, and keep pointing out that they’ve found a great connection between Neu! and the Clean, or between Deerhunter and the Verlaines without ever risking more than what they’re comfortable with. While Ghost Wave suss out their unique identity, it would be worthwhile to look at two bands that have had success at doing what Ghost Wave almost achieve: Yuck’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15068-yuck/"">self-titled debut</a> and Tame Imapala’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism""><i>Lonerism</i></a> both put the “revive” in “revivalist.” Right now, Ghost Wave just got a lot of rev.</p></div>"|18359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18359-ghost-wave-ages/|6.4|Jeremy Larson

They're certainly technical, boasting complicated arrangements played at dizzying tempos. Ulcerate, however, cannot and should not be branded with the “tech-death” stigma. Commonly, “tech-death” bands are criticized for “having no soul,” meaning they emphasize flash over songwriting. While this is often true, the criticism can be saddled with the false notion that simplicity means soul, as if rehashing the same Master and Asphyx songs has more integrity than trying to incorporate a few weird time signatures. In fact, there's nothing duller than laboriously listening to mid-paced death metal under the guise of “Celtic Frost worship” or keeping up tradition. Credit Ulcerate for not only subverting staleness on <i>Vermis</i>, their fourth album and first for Relapse, but for doing so with vigor.</p>
<p>Hints of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5978-hate-eternal/"" target=""_blank"">Hate Eternal</a> and <i>Demigod</i>-era Behemoth can be found in <i>Vermis</i>, particularly in the faster, more warlike sections of “The Imperious Weak” and the title track. Ulcerate are also aware that filling the room with <i>blasts</i> and <i>riffs</i> is only sometimes the effective battle plan, and that a little space can go a long way. “Clutching Revulsion” and “Weight of Emptiness” demonstrate this most aptly-- even the parts where the band lays off the acceleration are filled with unease, almost like blastbeats are a kind of security blanket. Drummer Jamie Saint Merat is crucial to the attack, playing with speed and fluidity that many death metal drummers couldn't come close to after hours of watching Tim Yeung YouTube lessons. Thanks in part to Saint Merat, Ulcerate possess a certain balance between precision and looseness that's usually only found only in some Finnish bands like Demigod and Demilich. They likely poured over the songs, no doubt, but there isn't any weariness here. As complicated as the music may be, <i>Vermis</i> is an album of songs, not exercises. Technicality is used to convey madness; it's not the ultimate goal in and of itself.</p>
<p>Across the water from Ulcerate is Australia, notorious for some of the most out-of-control metal in existence from groups such as Sadistik Exekution, Bestial Warlust, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30946-portal/"" target=""_blank"">Portal</a>, and Impetutous Ritual. Sometimes, the lines between metal and free improvisation aren't so clear. Ulcerate doesn't quite go into the stratosphere of chaos that those bands do, but there's enough of a bent to prevent them from being clinical and straight-laced. Guitarist Michael Hoggard once played live with New Zealand comrades Vassafor, so he's no stranger to bestial riffage. Ulcerate could be a model for how to reconcile modernity with death metal's timeless principles. The production is grungy enough to give <i>Vermis</i> the dirtiness death metal strives for, but it doesn't conceal that Ulcerate are very efficient and very driven to kill.</p>
<p>“Oh, this isn't Cianide. When did death metal become <i>life</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> metal?” Drown out such groans with </span><i>Vermis</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. They may not listen, but you don't have to listen to them either.</span></p></div>"|18459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18459-ulcerate-vermis/|7.7|Andy O'Connor

The Scottish trio's debut LP, <i>The Bones of What You Believe</i>, is a seamless fusion of emotive theatrics, hook-loaded songwriting, and some of the more forward-thinking sonics in electronic music right now. It's a style that feels very of-the-moment: Chvrches embody what a generation raised on electronic music is looking for in a rock band, taking the danceable textures favored by the Electric Daisy set and applying them to the sweeping songcraft of M83 and Passion Pit.</p>
<p>Unlike those those bands, Chvrches avoid guitars almost entirely, but the hooks on <i>The Bones of What You Believe </i>are indelible regardless of instrumentation, and the sound is immaculate. After Chvrches self-produced the album in band member Iain Cook's own Glasgow studio, big-deal boards guy Rich Costey (Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine) handled the mixing; his touch gives these tunes the bright clarity they deserve, with plenty of space for funhouse sonic triggers-- processed effects, pitched-down vocal samples, frizzy synth-pad textures. Every note sounds clean and sharp, a necessary corrective to the chemical-dipped wooziness that has dominated electronic indie pop in the last few years. </p>
<p>That sense of precision is unusual for a band this new, but Cook and Martin Doherty, who handle the majority of the instrumentation live and on record, are vets of Glasgow's perpetually fertile indie scene. Cook handled guitars and programming as a member of defunct alt-leaning post-rockers Aereogramme, while Doherty was once a live member of throat-shredding shoegazers the Twilight Sad (who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16189-no-one-can-ever-know/"">launched into their own synth excursions</a> around the time that Chvrches became a full-time concern). Together they make music that complements distinctive vocalists without overshadowing them.</p>
<p>Heard in the context of Glasgow's still-strong cottage industry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5046-frightened-rabbit/"">distinctly</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27752-we-were-promised-jetpacks/"">masculine</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10167-glasvegas/"">anguish-rock</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4281-travis/"">bands</a>, the emotional palette of Chvrches' lead singer Lauren Mayberry is a welcome change of pace. A local-band lifer who once pursued a career in music journalism, Mayberry's voice is a multifaceted instrument, the emotional kernel in Chvrches' molecular makeup. She can sound cutting, aching, triumphant, fragile, and weightless, sometimes all at once; on ""Lies"", she soars above the chorus' mountainous build, and her vocal surge rescues the murky techno of ""Science/Visions"", the closest thing to a miss on this otherwise rock-solid album.</p>
<p>Even when Mayberry's at her most powerful, her voice possesses a specific, relatable humanity, which brightens the adolescent glow of her lyrics. (Occasional lead singer Doherty, previously the band's weak link, makes good enough on his two featured songs, the rippling ""Under the Tide"" and the prom-dance lushness of ""You Caught the Light""). Her words might look overwrought on paper, but when set to the emotive sounds that Chvrches trade in, they sound towering, impassioned, and life-affirming. Depeche Mode, a spiritual antecedent, have a classic song with the refrain <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT3FvDHMyo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All I ever wanted/ All I ever needed/ Is here, in my arms""</a>; that kind of emotional directness and simplicity is a hallmark of the songwriting here.</p>
<p><i>The Bones of What You Believe</i> also shares some of Depeche Mode's large-scale ambition: the arpeggiated-synth burst that closes ""Tether"" sounds like it was orchestrated for the optimal turn-all-the-lasers-on-at-once trigger at a live performance, and it's all the better for it. Throughout, Chvrches' effortless populism finds them in a long tradition of bands who take a highly personal sense of turmoil and blow it up onto an arena-sized screen. Granted, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49905-sxsw-chvrches/"">recent live performances</a> have suggested that they have a ways to go before their concert-conquering potential catches up with the ability they display on record, but such growing pains are normal for a band this new. For now, on record, Chvrches know how to go big on an intimate scale, to remind us of the stuff that keeps us living.</p></div>"|18523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18523-chvrches-the-bones-of-what-you-believe/|8.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

As Yoni Wolf <a href=""http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/announcing...-why-golden-tickets.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained on the Joyful Noise label's website</a>, the EP is a collection of songs for and about specific <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4593-why/"" target=""_blank"">WHY?</a> fans. ""We would write a theme song for one customer who came to the [WHY?] web store and bought something every month... We'd read all about them on Facebook and Twitter, and sometimes even go so far as to contact their significant other to ask them questions. Then I would write the song on piano, and my brother would take the skeleton of lyrics &amp; piano and turn it into a fully realized arrangement.""</p>
<p>Those seven songs are collected here, on the <i>Golden Tickets</i> EP, and if I was any of these hardcore fans, I would be struggling with the uncomfortable question of whether my favorite band was personally mocking or belittling me. Part of the issue with these fan-specific valentines is unfair to Wolf but hard to ignore; Wolf's acrid delivery turns everything a little smarmy, which suits him well when he's addressing his favorite subject-- himself and his many faults-- but skews a little queasy when he's paying tribute to people who've done him the favor of repeatedly buying his music.</p>
<p>If I were the fan who Wolf pays tribute to on ""Banana Mae"", for instance, I would have some serious questions.  Wolf opens with the room-clearing line ""Follow me, @banana_mae/ If you wanna see what I have to say/ now I'm only less than twenty-<i>tre</i>/ But I'll Twit a tweet to make your hair turn grey"" before offering an unflattering imitation of a stereotypical vapid, prattling teenage girl. Banana Mae gets the last laugh, though; the second verse is cobbled together from her own tweets, which ironically contain the only characteristically Yoni Wolfian insights to be found on <i>Golden Tickets</i>: ""I'm very impatient for science to figure out/ how I can clone myself and make the clone interact with my friends and family, it's tiring."" Or: ""I think the reason I don’t have any friends is ‘cause the people that I click with the best/ Also hate to leave their beds."" You can hear what she might like in Wolf's best writing.</p>
<p>Speaking of which: For WHY? fans who are <i>not</i> the seven people selected as this EP's subject matter, these songs represent the nadir of the WHY? project. Every song begins with the character baldly introducing themselves: ""My name is Hunter Van Brocklin."" ""Well it's me, Dropjaw."" Or ""Peta E. Godfrey, I'm a bonafide Aussie."" The characterizations are less sketches of human people and more little sock-puppet retellings of the sort of basic biographical info you can glean from scanning a person's Facebook and Twitter: ""I was born to teach/ I do humanities/ Strictly public school, I think that should be the rule,"" he sings on ""Peta Godfrey"". Wolf's lyrics are bewilderingly lazy throughout: Hunter Van Brocklin is ""just a small-town boy in this big city"" <i>and</i> a ""a simple Southern man trying to find my fate."" Van Brocklin has ""fingers like a poem when they press the keys."" Fingers like a poem?</p>
<p>Wolf has long been a shrewd, incisive writer, and his words have often borne testament to the virtues of mental sweat and finger-cramping rewriting. You could practically see the ghosted revisions hovering over a perfect line like ""God put a song on my palm that you can't read/ I'll be embalmed with it long before, you'll see."" ""I want that sharpened steel of truth in every word,"" he insisted on ""This Blackest Purse."" It's been awhile since we've seen that guy. On <i>Golden Tickets</i>, it sounds as if he's simply given up trying. There is one remaining golden ticket, by the way: ""The lucky person who receives this golden ticket will have a WHY? song written about him or her,"" the album page says. ""No foolin."" In context, it sounds like a threat.</p></div>"|18492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18492-why-golden-tickets/|3.0|Jayson Greene

Dreamt up at women's-only Smith College, in Northampton, Mass., bassist Ally Einbinder and drummer Victoria Mandanas had already played the punk scene, allowing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30966-potty-mouth/"" target=""_blank"">Potty Mouth</a> a driving energy, while Phoebe Harris, also a visual artist, didn't own a guitar. Abby Weems, a recent high school grad, fronts the band with deceptively simple lyrical play-- her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"" target=""_blank"">Liz Phair</a>-style monotone is clear and literal, underscoring the direct quality of their pop-punk poetry. At times the guitars weave like early ramshackle post-punk, but Potty Mouth's upbeat surf fuzz could be likened to any number of fast, barebones 70s and 90s punk bands who were learning as they went. You could imagine them covering Buzzcocks, Jawbreaker, or maybe Excuse 17.</p>
<p>With that, Potty Mouth are among a crop of bands expanding the idea of ""pop-punk"" in 2013-- see Don Giovanni and Salinas Records' back catalogues for other recent examples-- disassociating the mind-numbing skate-and-weed culture that has often surrounded that descriptor. The difference was well exemplified this spring, when Potty Mouth and the likeminded Aye Nako played within the bright gallery walls of New York's New Museum.</p>
<p><i>Hell Bent </i>inches Potty Mouth towards more profound songwriting than last year's great <i>Sun Damage</i> EP. The lyrics focus primarily on the many facets of what it means to be young-- desire to ditch smalltown life, irresponsible choices that bring on ""The Spins,"" feeling infinite-- but what makes <i>Hell Bent</i> such a glorious <i>Rookie</i>-era superlative of feminist punk today is the sense of confidence and personal conviction Potty Mouth's songs conjure. This appears most strongly as <i>Hell Bent</i> opens and closes. ""The Gap"", which references the unconventional post-high school gap year, is about searching for more than you've been handed and believing in yourself. The slow-building closer ""The Better End"", shout-sung by guitarist Phoebe Harris, reconciles a bitter breakup (""Go ahead/ Kiss your friend"") while feeling assertive in walking away: ""Here's the thing/ I'm the best,"" Harris screams, ""I know it's hard/ To digest.""</p>
<p>More often than not, though, the songs on <i>Hell Bent</i> center on confusion, uncertainty, and frustration within contexts like friendship, identity, or dreaming. ""Damage"" charges forward with the grey melancholy and earnestness of early emo, as Weems grapples with feeling helpless in a dire situation. On ""Sleep Talk"", she fears what might seep into her subconscious at night-- ""I have this feeling that I'll wake up and wanna talk to you""-- coasting over one of the record's best hooks. ""Shithead"", meanwhile, is an angsty reprieve, as Weems hollers funny disses at a seemingly boy-crazed ex-friend-- ""You're possessed by a dick/ And your mind's in a ditch""-- like fellow Western Mass resident Kim Gordon's suggestion on Sonic Youth classic ""Becuz"", but entirely unkind, and largely unforgiving.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15873-black-and-studs/"" target=""_blank"">“Black and Studs”</a> is the best Potty Mouth song yet-- a commentary on searching for your own essence within a punk subculture where individuals still tend to conform in certain ways. ""What happened to you to make you wear black and studs?"" Weems sings, before turning this exceedingly catchy question onto herself, with airy echoes harmonized underneath. Although ""Black and Studs"" is the band's only song to get critical on punk politics, it feels like a potent extension of an overarching idea that guides Potty Mouth-- in interviews, they've been vocal about the values they aim to incorporate into the makeup of their band, as well as the ageism and sexism they've faced. In doing so, Potty Mouth have functioned under the golden rule of writing songs in relatively simple structures while keeping the narrative of their band strong.</p>
<p>Potty Mouth also hail from an exciting moment for smart guitar rock in their collegiate hometown-- along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/"" target=""_blank"">Speedy Ortiz</a> (spot frontwoman Sadie Dupuis in <a href=""http://vimeo.com/70001326"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the video for ""The Spins""</a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30359-california-x/"" target=""_blank"">California X</a>, they're doing a fine job romanticizing Northampton, leaving 20-somethings everywhere wondering if they'd not be better off enrolling in Amherst's grad school and plugging in without looking back. <i>Hell Bent</i>, while elemental, sounds sincere and grounded but free-- a self-assured debut of principled pop-punk that leaves room for growth.</p></div>"|18417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18417-potty-mouth-hell-bent/|7.8|Jenn Pelly

This kind of idea wasn't exactly novel: Chillwave had broken and crested, VHS nostalgia was inescapable, and bands claiming the tag ""dream pop"" were cropping up like dandelions in springtime-- was it really possible that none of them had already written something called ""Videotapes""?</p>
<p>It's a testament to Portland's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29693-blouse/"">Blouse</a>, then, that the murky earworm bearing that particular name managed to stand out even among the crowded crop of hypnagogic pop. Maybe that's because, like ""Videotapes"", all the songs on their unexpectedly fresh self-titled debut were driven by the tension of opposing forces, as the heat generated from radiant, sun-bursting synths collided with the airy cool of Charlie Hilton's vocals. <i>Blouse</i> found a balance between texture and melody: here was a band that clearly cared about atmosphere, but never at the expense of a solid, <i>Top Gun</i> soundtrack-worthy hook.</p>
<p>With their second full-length <i>Imperium</i>, though, the band is making a conscious push to distance itself from those electro-tinged beginnings. Blouse have nixed the synths and drum machines: Multi-instrumentalist and producer Jacob Portrait (who also plays bass in Unknown Mortal Orchestra) proudly announces in the press release that the record was made entirely with ""instruments that don't plug into the wall."" Sure, selling your proverbial turntables to buy guitars is enough of a sophomore album cliché to get a mention in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xG4oFny2Pk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Losing My Edge""</a>, but luckily Blouse's guitar-driven make-over hasn't rendered them unrecognizable. That much is clear from the jump: Bouncy opener ""Imperium"" takes some of the familiar elements of <i>Blouse</i>'s best tunes-- namely sweeping strums and lurching, rubbery basslines-- and blends them into a gloomy swirl. ""Are you one of us?/ Are you one of us?"" Hilton chants as the song winds down, in a haunting monotone that's half Hope Sandoval, half creepily malfunctioning automaton. Though Hilton's out in front, Portrait is Blouse's secret weapon, concocting the immersive textures that give <i>Imperium</i> its distinct atmosphere. The driving ""Eyesite"" sounds like it was recorded in the frigid but sparkling depths of an icy cave, while the up-tempo ripper ""Arrested"" has the loose, unvarnished feel of a band jamming in a the garage-- albeit one equipped with an enviable pedal board.</p>
<p>And yet, there's a lack of variety in <i>Imperium</i>'s marble-cool tone that makes it feel more one-note than Blouse's debut. It's laudable for a band to push itself out of its comfort zone on its second album-- there are artists out there who lay such a lazily trendy coating of synthesizers over their songs that the electricity in their practice spaces should be cut just to stir creativity. But Blouse weren’t one of those bands. Their debut showed the promise of growth, and their “no synth” policy may have hemmed them in unnecessarily. When Blouse headlined one of Captured Tracks' 5 year anniversary shows earlier this month, the contrast was clear: The new, thoughtfully structured songs showcased the band’s ear for sticky hooks, but only when Portrait plugged in his tower of synths to play older track like ""Time Travel"" and ""Into Black"" did the music bloom.</p></div>"|18495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18495-blouse-imperium/|7.0|Lindsay Zoladz

The record spotlights every asset of the band, too. The dual guitars are enormous, with the tube-amp tones delivering the riffs in massive waves and presenting the solos less as interruptions and more as big, breaking-news events. The rhythm section is relentless; swollen bass pushes between every deep groove, underlined and emphasized by ubiquitous cymbal splatter. And the voice of Dorthia Cottrell-- Windhand’s lugubrious and bewitching frontwoman-- hangs above it all, her dark-minded tunes settling over the monolithic music like a dense, mountainous fog. Her haunting turn as a solo singer-songwriter serves as the record’s surprising centerpiece. It’s a quiet coup within an otherwise very loud and insistent marathon.</p>
<p>While Windhand understand the sound and the structure of their liminal stoner rock and doom metal, the actual songs on <i>Soma</i> fall short of their forebears. Of these six tracks, only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15802-windhand-woodbine/"" target=""_blank"">“Woodbine”</a> offers a truly compelling hook, with Cottrell singing a loving if laughable ode to Satan-- “Come on, Satan, surround me”-- with the hidden verve of a pop singer. The band traces her motion perfectly, strengthening the thread of melody rather than swallowing it. Oftentimes, though, Windhand treat the songs like kids too excited to have a new coloring book, their heavy hands drawing so far outside the lines that the shapes themselves become obfuscated. During “Orchard”, for instance, Cottrell moves in interesting dynamic arches, howling her lines only to slink suddenly behind them. But Asechiah Bogdan and Garrett Morris crowd her out, filling so much of the space with a rote weedian riff that she’s barely there at all. The same applies to “Cassock”, where her two short verses seem almost like add-ons for a piece simply meant as a showcase for Windhand’s tempo range--mid-tempo to something slightly faster to something slightly slower to something a bit faster still to the silent end.</p>
<p>If that sounds tedious, it can be. That’s another problem with <i>Soma</i>. Windhand consistently take their time to do very little, a flaw epitomized by the relatively punch-less one-two combination of “Cassock” and “Boleskin”. The latter builds from an acoustic intro into a riff that’s, once again, very plain. There’s one great, squealing solo and another good one, but Windhand mostly plod along, restating their case until the tune becomes more nuisance than mantra. Even on shorter numbers, that sense of fatigue reoccurs because Cottrell's effects-laden voice and hooks are pushed so far afield. The band’s <a href=""http://windhandva.bandcamp.com/album/windhand"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled 2011 debut</a> didn’t feature an acoustic track from Cottrell because it didn’t need it. Well-paced and less burdened by its own seismic sounds, that five-song record felt urgent and varied, giving its guitar leads more to do than circle back and forth. “Heap Wolves” was a quick dose of Sabbath-baiting perfection, while the 11-minute “Summon the Moon” took care to anchor its length to an indelible chorus. But <i>Soma</i> feels impregnably monotonous. When Cottrell’s multi-tracked coo arrives without distraction at the start of “Evergreen”, the break feels more like a necessary respite than an interesting diversion. You might find yourself wishing she’d just keep singing. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/windhand-soma-relapse-records-interview-album-stream/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a <i>Spin</i> interview with Morris</a> opened with this proclamation: “I don’t want to get pigeonholed as a ‘doom’ band.” On <i>Soma</i>, Windhand actively fight against that identity but lose, the collection's songs turning into stylistic slogs even as the band ostensibly works to avoid that end. Following their two-year-old debut, their deal with Relapse, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17894-cough-windhand-reflection-of-the-negative/"" target=""_blank"">their colossal split with fellow Richmond heavies Cough</a>, Windhand were poised as one of the year’s potential metal breakthroughs. But <i>Soma</i> sits still, paralyzed by the weight of a sound that’s too big for this promising band to manage, at least for now.</p></div>"|18418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18418-windhand-soma/|7.0|Grayson Currin

And where the album’s title would reflect Cobain’s lyrical yearning for a back-to-the-womb retreat from celebrity scrutiny, it also proved emblematic of the record's messy birth: A by-all-reports harmonious two-week quickie session with recording engineer Steve Albini in a rural Minnesota studio would lead to months of acrimonious exchanges in the press among the band, DGC, and Albini over the purportedly unlistenable nature of the results, requests for cleaner mixes, and cruddy cassette copies leaked to radio that falsely reinforced the label’s misgivings. (The second-guessing circumstances were not that dissimilar to those of the preceding <i>Nevermind</i>-- wherein Butch Vig's original recordings were eventually handed over to Andy Wallace for a platinum-plated finish-- only this time, the outcome had the potential to affect Geffen's share price.) </p>
<p>Upon release, <i>In Utero</i> may have debuted at number one, but initially it was something of a pyrrhic victory: Rather than lead a wave of Jesus Lizard-inspired noise bands to the top of the <i>Billboard</i> charts,<i> In Utero</i> would send millions of Nirvana’s more casual crossover fans scurrying into the warm embrace of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"" target=""_blank"">Pearl Jam</a>’s record-setting October '93 release <i>Vs</i>., an album that, from a music-biz perspective, was the true blockbuster sequel to <i>Nevermind</i>. In that sense, this first version of <i>In Utero</i> resonates as much today as a symbolic gesture as a collection of 12 unrelentingly visceral rock songs, a how-to manual for any artist at the top of their game-- from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6656-kid-a/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kid A</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a>-- that would rather use their elevated position to provoke their audience than pander to it. </p>
<p>The second version of <i>In Utero</i> came to be on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aHueh7kqAk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">April 8, 1994</a>, from which point the album would be forever known as the rough draft for rock‘n’roll’s most famous suicide note. In the wake of Cobain’s shotgunned sign-off, it became nigh impossible to hear <i>In Utero</i> in any other context. The infamous album-opening lyric that once dripped with sarcasm-- “Teenage angst has paid off well/ Now I’m bored and old”-- now sounded coldly nihilistic. Where the seismic stomper “Scentless Apprentice” invoked Patrick Süskind’s novel <i>Perfume</i> as metaphor for Cobain’s festering disgust with the music press and industry, the song’s grueling shriek of “<i>get awwwwwaaaayyyy</i>” suddenly seemed to be directed at humanity itself. The “Leonard Cohen after-world” fantasy of “Pennyroyal Tea” turned into wish fulfillment; “All Apologies” ceased to be an innocently plaintive pop song and was instead permanently etched into its writer's epitaph.  </p>
<p>But with this two-disc 20th-anniversary reissue, we now have a third version of <i>In Utero, </i>and I’m not just referring to the newly remixed iteration of the album. Taken as a whole, the package-- which also includes a remastered version of the original mix, B-sides, outtakes, a slew of embryonic demos, and a cheeky but affecting liner-note essay by comedian/tourmate Bobcat Goldthwait-- puts lie to the notion that <i>In Utero</i> is the soundtrack to a suicide, commercial or otherwise. In charting the songs’ evolution from rough instrumentals to the militaristic blasts of fury heard on the album proper, and through the outré experiments scrapped along the way, we hear a band that was on the cusp of an intriguing new phase.</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7q8yDPJFo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a surprisingly conciliatory Musique Plus interview</a> conducted just prior to the album’s release, Cobain stated that <i>In Utero</i> would mark the end of Nirvana as grunge torchbearers and, throughout the record, the band screech and howl like they're skinning themselves alive to expedite their reinvention. But not a lyric goes by on the album where Cobain doesn’t sound conflicted between what he wants to do and what he feels he has to do. The scowling verses of “Serve the Servants” are countered by the chorus’ soothing incantation of the song’s title, as if Cobain had to anesthetize himself in order to answer his audience’s populist demands. You didn’t need to hear the feedback assault of “Radio Friendly Unit Shifter” to sense the irony reeking from its title, while the sludgy savagery of “Milk It” deploys Cobain’s fascinations with bodily fluids and birthing to depict a soul being run through the music-industry wringer. Though Cobain claimed in the aforementioned interview that the deliberately bald language of “Rape Me” was his response to misinterpretations of Nirvana’s more ambiguous portraits of sexual/power dynamics (“Polly”, “About a Girl”), the fact that it cops the riff to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his most famous song</a> unsubtly directs the titular demand to his hit-seeking minders; when he answers his request by repeating “I’m not the only one,” he seems to be placating himself with the knowledge that he’s not the first punk-rocker caught in a boardroom power play. (And, in light of Cobain’s mounting disdain for the media, I can’t be the only person who’s always heard that line in “All Apologies” as “choking on the ashes of her <i>NME</i>.”)</p>
<p>But this set supports the theory that Cobain didn’t necessarily fear or hate success; his real struggle was achieving it on his own terms. If he <i>really</i> wanted to clear the room, he could’ve made <i>In Utero</i> a lot weirder than it actually turned out to be: among the outtakes here is “Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flowing Through the Strip” (which previously surfaced stateside on the barrel-scraping 2004 box set <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5811-with-the-lights-out/""><i>With the Lights Out</i></a>), an exceedingly odd, stream-of-consciousness ramble that sees Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl adopting the art-damaged inscrutability of then-underground darlings Pavement. Also included are Albini’s supposedly contentious original mixes for <i>In Utero</i>’s two singles, “Heart-Shaped Box” and “All Apologies”, which the band eventually handed over to R.E.M. associate Scott Litt to create the spit-shined radio-friendly versions that wound up on the final record. Furthermore, Litt's crisper alternate take of ""Penny Royal Tea"" (which scrubs off a layer of its Sebadohian scuzz) is featured here as a reinforcement of Nirvana's acquiescent impulses -- it first appeared on a special edition of <i>In Utero</i> created specifically for Wal-Mart that swapped out the title of ""Rape Me"" for the more big-box-shopper-friendly ""Waif Me."" (That the differences between the Albini and Litt's mixes are slight speaks to the sort of nitpicking the band were being subjected from without and within.) And in hearing the unvarnished demos of “Scentless Apprentice” and “Radio Friendly Unit Shifter”, you get a clearer sense of just how much refinement and fierce discipline they were subjected to before being presented to the public. (In particular, the versions featured in the band's MTV<i> Live and Loud</i> concert from December 1993 -- included in a deluxe four-disc version of this set -- perfectly encapsulate the <i>In Utero</i> ideal of arena-rock at its most anarchic.)</p>
<p>There’s also evidence here to suggest that, in spite of <i>In Utero</i>’s caustic reputation, Nirvana were also keen to explore more sophisticated songcraft. “Sappy” was presumably kept off the <i>In Utero</i> tracklist (and punted over to the <i>No Alternative</i> charity compilation) due to its strong resemblance to <i>Nevermind</i> corkers like “Drain You”, but it still stands as one of Cobain’s purest, most effortless power-pop gestures, while the hushed B-side ballad “Marigold” serves as a test flight for Grohl’s Foo Fighters. Most surprising of all is an early demo of “All Apologies” with an acoustic, countrified shimmer that could practically pass for a CCR golden oldie, transmuting the song's overarching sense of resignation into bright-eyed, fresh-start optimism. Though Nirvana obviously had second thoughts about assuming such a radically chipper guise, that sort of willingness to mess with their essence would carry over to the band’s subsequent touring formation, on which ex-Germs guitarist Pat Smear was added to fill out the sound and the sight of guest cellists was not uncommon. </p>
<p>This exploratory ethos also informs <i>In Utero</i>’s new 2013 mix, overseen by Albini with input from Novoselic, Grohl, and Smear. Strangely enough, the revamp was inspired by another rock icon who died at 27:<a href=""http://exclaim.ca/News/krist_novoselic_steve_albini_discuss_nirvanas_in_utero_reissue"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Novoselic recently revealed</a> the idea came to him after hearing a gussied-up Doors compilation that emphasized certain, previously unnoticed sonic details. Albini, however, has offered a more pragmatic rationale: <i>In Utero</i>’s quick gestation period meant some mixing decisions were made off-the-cuff, resulting in various instrumental parts, alternate guitar solos, and harmony lines being left out. As <a href=""http://vishkhanna.com/2013/08/16/ep-24-steve-albini/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told podcaster Vish Khanna</a>, his intention was not to replace the 1993 mix, but to simply take a snapshot of the same songs “from a different angle.” The new version is in fact more textured and nuanced, but not at the expense of the album's bone-dry, brutalizing crunch. Most of its touch-ups are tastefully unobtrusive and illuminating, like the unearthed cello lines creeping behind the chorus of “Serve the Servants” that bring a greater sense of melancholy to the fore, or the screeching strings and slowly decaying fadeout of “All Apologies” that lend a more palpable degree of finality to the proceedings. But there are times where the listening experience is reduced to a parlor game of spotting what’s been added and what’s been omitted: On the upside, “Scentless Apprentice” now sounds like it’s being screamed into a toilet, pushing the song to exciting new levels of gnarliness, but excising the cello parts that are so integral to “Dumb” is, well, kinda dumb.</p>
<p>Fittingly, for an album that starkly contrasts Nirvana's melodic and maniacal extremes, <i>In Utero: 20<span style=""font-size: 12px;"">th</span> Anniversary Edition</i> highlights another inherent contradiction: much like the Beatles’ <i>Let It Be</i>, what was originally intended to be a raw, back-to-basics reaction to past excesses has, ironically, been subjected to so much over-thinking and console-board tinkering (this latest mix constituting its <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1093-let-it-be-naked/"" target=""_blank"">Let It Be… Naked</a> </i>moment of revisionism). But all these mutations reflect the restless, irrepressible nature of these songs, which-- whether in the form of crude demos or modern-day remasters-- still sting and ooze like a flesh wound that refuses to heal. And yet <i>In Utero</i> is the sort of painful shock that, paradoxicalaly, reinstills the empowering sensation of feeling alive. Cobain may have been bored, but he checked out before he grew old; when listening to his final collection of songs, you forget, for a little while, the possibility of either. </p></div>"|18517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18517-nirvana-in-utero-20th-anniversary-edition/|10.0|Stuart Berman

In 2010, he released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13935-scratch-my-back/""><i>Scratch My Back</i></a>, his first studio album in eight years, which collected skeletal covers of songs by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4158-paul-simon/"">Paul Simon</a>. It was part of a concept where each of the artists he covered would then cover his songs on a follow-up titled <i>And</i> <i>I’ll Scratch Yours</i>. As he told <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/02/peter-gabriel-scratch-my-back"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Guardian</i></a> three years ago, “Rather than having a passive project where you do your own thing with people’s songs, I wanted to see if I could interact with the people who wrote them, so they had to be living and amenable, or initially amenable.”</p>
<p>That last phrase proved crucial. Gabriel’s peculiar musical choices-- slowing every song down to a uniform crawl, setting them in bleakly orchestral arrangements, intoning the lyrics in a near-spoken cadence-- alienated many long-time fans as well as some of the artists. Most notably: Radiohead, upon hearing Gabriel’s rococo-minimalist version of “Street Spirit (Fade Out)"", decided they were no longer amenable and backed out of covering “Wallflower”<i>.</i> Bowie, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1279-ray-davies/"">Ray Davies</a> also declined to participate, so Gabriel recruited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"">Feist</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/139-joseph-arthur/"">Joseph Arthur</a> as replacements. Neither of their covers proves particularly revelatory: Backed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28408-timber-timbre/"">Timber Timbre</a> on “Don’t Give Up”, Feist can’t quite muster the desperation and intimacy of the original, although Arthur’s decision to slow “Shock the Monkey” to half-speed plays out surprisingly well.</p>
<p>Originally, both of these albums<i> </i>were intended to be released simultaneously in 2010, but it took three long years to finally scratch their backs. During that time Gabriel and the other artists released some of the tracks via iTunes and Record Store Day exclusives, which means nearly half of <i>I’ll Scratch Yours</i> has long been available. Bon Iver’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38121-bon-iver-covers-peter-gabriel-for-record-store-day-single/"">“Come Talk to Me”</a>, released on a split-7"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37763-hear-peter-gabriel-cover-bon-iver/"">Gabriel’s version of “Flume”</a>, sounds weirdly faithful to the original, yet it’s so muted and understated that it ends up missing the point of the song: rather than an open line of communication, it’s a busy signal. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a> sounds similarly noncommittal on “I Don’t Remember"", his voice alarmingly thin and even sickly. At least <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2742-stephin-merritt/"">Stephin Merritt</a> has a good time with “Not One of Us”, injecting some much-needed humor into the song, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a> takes the piss out of the hoary “Solsbury Hill”, a rom-com staple that ends up squatting in a Bronx tenement ca. 1976. Slowed down and skeezed up with sneers of distorted guitar, it’s nearly unrecognizable delivered in Reed's supremely stoic voice. </p>
<p>The familiarity of these songs drains much of the surprise and novelty from the album, yet the new songs prove just as uneven and in many cases noncommittal, as though the artists were embarrassed to be included on the tracklist. The Arcade Fire, long rumored to be only initially amenable, turn in a cover of “Games Without Frontiers” so obligatory it sounds like they changed their minds and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38063-update-arcade-fire-not-covering-peter-gabriels-games-without-frontiers/"">decided not to participate</a> after all. It lacks the earth-rattling pomp of their original material and, worse, the sharp derision of Gabriel’s 1980 version. On the other hand, you can’t fault the match of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a> with “Big Time”, off Gabriel’s 1986 album <i>So</i>. It’s so perfect I’m surprised it hasn’t happened already, and Newman sings the line “My ass is getting bigger” like he wishes he’d written it himself. It’s too bad, then, that the production is so stiff, ratcheted to rigid beats that constrict his vocals considerably. He sounds like he wants to cut loose and jazz the song up in the style of Mose Allison, yet has to remind himself to adhere to the strict meter.</p>
<p>Who knows how <i>I’ll Scratch Yours</i> would have sounded if it had been released as planned, on schedule and with all artists amenable? Gabriel intended this pair of albums to be an exercise in mutual interpretation, emphasizing not only the songwriting but the distinctive tics and traits an artist naturally brings to lyrics and melody. There’s something charming about the clunkiness of that concept, especially the way it ignores the realities of dealing with artists (“like herding cats,” he told <i>The Guardian</i>) and releasing music in a digital era. As a double album, <i>Scratch</i> might have produced something like an elaborate mixtape with originals on one side of the Maxell and covers on the other. In execution, however, <i>I’ll Scratch Yours</i> plays like another artifact of the 90s, this one less fondly remembered. It's a tribute album-- or, better yet, a self-tribute album. This is Gabriel scratching his own back. </p></div>"|18519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18519-peter-gabriel-and-ill-scratch-yours/|4.9|Stephen M. Deusner

He's worked in art and modern dance in the interim, but Georgopoulos has clearly spent some time thinking about how to retool this project as well. <i>The Soft Wave</i> was all balmy synth textures and endlessly repeating figures, sometimes lightly prickled by waves of bass and distorted guitar. Georgopoulos found his voice toward the close of that record, forgoing his mostly instrumental work to deliver a pitch-perfect pastiche of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>'s 70s vocal work on ""From a Balcony Overlooking the Sea"". Surprisingly, it's a thread he picks at for the bulk of <i>MORE</i>, settling into a more song-oriented incarnation of Arp that might cause people familiar with his older work to check the package to make sure it's not some other band.</p>
<p>Where Georgopoulos has landed is somewhere in-between various strains of the British art school tradition, where the mundane and the fantastic are equally enthralling. It's part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"">Roxy Music</a> sci-fi fantasia, part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a> down-the-chip-shop scruffiness. Georgopoulos is interested in glamour for sure-- song titles here include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15813-high-heeled-clouds/"">""High-Heeled Clouds""</a> and ""A Tiger in the Hall at Versailles""-- but it's a scruffy, vaudevillian form of it. The sad, clangorous end to ""Clouds"" feels like a paean to actors who couldn't quite make it, to singers who had a shot at the big time and just fell short. It's heavy on pastiche, but very well done at times. You won't hear a better piece of Eno worship than ""Judy Nylon"" this year. Even the title is wonderfully Eno-esque. It's too bad Georgopoulos waits until the closing track, ""Persuasion"", to get anywhere near the same sense of pop euphoria again.</p>
<p>So there's a strong sense of someone not reaching particularly hard to get beyond their influences, but even that takes on an appropriate hue as the album progresses. <i>MORE</i> edges into the feel of low-rent theater at times, where the makeup starts to run under the lights, where the performer on stage is revealed to be a fraud. Georgopoulos does a blues track and he calls it <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15626-arp-more-blues/"">""(MORE) BLUES""</a>. He's emptied out pop and found a bunch of dead ends, all circling back in on themselves. Still, this isn't an exercise in the futility of writing this stuff in 2013; it's more like a light, cheerful prod at the parameters of pop. Along the way we get plenty of ambient interludes, hints of Brill Building pop, a dose of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>-y goodness. There's a sense Georgopoulos isn't sure what Arp should be, allowing him to resist being shaped, packaged, and neatly filed away.</p>
<p>In among all the switching up there's a centerpiece to all of this, if one can exist in such a baffling, un-centered piece, titled ""Gravity (For Charlemagne Palestine)"", which is one-part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> repetitive build, one-part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a>-style astral gazing. Naturally, going from that to the cheeky end-of-seaside-pier tracks takes some adjusting. But <i>MORE</i> is an album that takes some time to settle in, to really get to grips with all its diverse tendencies. Already it feels like it could become a weightier work over time if Georgopoulos leaves all this behind and moves on elsewhere, causing this album to perpetually spin in its own odd orbit. It's mostly a delight to return to, with its misshapen ways sometimes working toward a bigger picture until Georgopoulos flushes it all down the u-bend via another baffling turn. Here he's got a musical outlet that's not defined at all, and that's a strange and occasionally beautiful thing.</p></div>"|18528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18528-arp-more/|7.0|Nick Neyland

By 2009, they had outgrown their original moniker (R.I.P. Goat Molestör) under which they’d released a now impossibly rare split with their spiritual brothers Necros Christos and made steady headway in underground circles beginning with 2003’s <i>Ancient Barbaric Assault</i> demo. That night, smeared with black paint and clad in leather, the four lads jammed into the dingy basement of a goth club in Birmingham alongside fellow UK extremists Cruciamentum (with whom they share members) and Scythian, then proceeded to unleash hell. I was blown away then, and now, years later, they’ve continued to impress not only me but the thousands of others who have found themselves captivated by the band’s almost uncanny knack for morbid metal of death. Profound Lore has been courting the quartet for years, and are understandably chuffed to be co-releasing Grave Miasma’s debut LP, shouldering the glorious burden with the band’s longtime allies Sepulchral Voice.<i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>Odori Sepulcrorum</i> is the product of years of slow, steady work. The band has been in no rush to toe death metal’s party line and bang out three releases a year. Rather, they’ve chosen to approach this first full-length with extraordinary care and precision. It shows, whether in the fluttering scales and fiery solo that distinguish “έσχατος”, the eerie strangeness of album closer “Ossuary”, or the ominous interlude that surfaces near the album’s end to ring in the serpentine sitar melody on “Seven Coils”. Vocalist and guitarist Y is of Israeli descent and has always harbored a keen interest in Middle Eastern music, and the band’s unorthodox treatment of those ancient scales alongside various traditional and unorthodox instruments slightly echoes Necros Christos’ approach (though is conducted with a considerably lighter touch). Hammond organ, Tibetan gongs, flute, and the aforementioned sitar are woven into the songs themselves rather than isolated into interludes or standout passages, and lend an air of otherworldly evil to what might otherwise seem as standard compositions at first glance. Of all the current death metal bands clamoring for recognition, Grave Miasma certainly deserve a deeper look. There is more to them than what they may initially seem.</p>
<p>A reverence for the theory and practice of death imbues the band’s aesthetic and presentation, channeling Teitanblood and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27719-dead-congregation/"" target=""_blank"">Dead Congregation</a> as often as they emulate Drowned or Morbid Angel. Occult leanings are nothing new in this arena, but Grave Miasma take their studies seriously, littering their songs with arcane references and esoteric symbolism as well as the expected odes to decay and damnation. The recording is drenched in delay and reverb, summoning up a suffocating black fog of atmosphere to envelop the clever arrangements and dynamic tempos, and drummer D (Y's brother, who's also in Adorior and Cruciamentum) brings the songs to life with his inventive, powerful arrangements. Searing guitar work from Deströyer 666 &amp; Cruciamentum shredder R blazes atop A’s subterranean death grooves and tears through the vocalist’s rumbling, guttural invocations. Despite the sonic extremity on display, the songs themselves are catchy and invite a visceral reaction-- I dare you to listen to this without nodding along to the burly mid-tempo riff on “Ascension Eye”. When witnessed live, the reaction becomes more violent.</p>
<p>The unavoidable truth is that while many of the modern death metal bands have carried on plugging away, dredging up bargain basement Azagthoth riffs, and listening to <i>Onward to Golgotha</i> on repeat, these four Englishmen have focused their energies into creating something that is, simply, better. The quality of songwriting found on <i>Odori Sepulcrorum</i> stands a considerable height above every other death metal album released this year, and has cemented its creators’ fate as one of the genre’s most important new bands.</p></div>"|18394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18394-grave-miasma-odori-sepulcrorum/|8.0|Kim Kelly

It was one of the few moments on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29960-the-internet/"" target=""_blank"">the Internet</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16145-purple-naked-ladies/"" target=""_blank""><i>Purple Naked Ladies</i></a> where you could draw a direct line from the bubbling neo-soul of Syd and Matt Martians to the rest of Odd Future. Outside of a few appearances from Left Brain and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1669-mike-g/"" target=""_blank"">Mike G</a>-- the latter of which Syd has produced for in the past-- <i>Purple Naked Ladies</i> felt largely disconnected from the entire OFWGKTA oeuvre, the controversial collective mentioned more out of obligation than because of any musical or ideological kinship. On their sophomore album, <i>Feel Good</i>, the Internet continue along this path, sharpening their songwriting and slowly reigning in their propensity to wander.</p>
<p>The biggest leap forward is made by Syd herself-- where in the past she would sometimes disappear into her surroundings she now takes center stage with confidence, her down pillow-soft vocals claiming the spotlight with an easy swagger. Her voice is still a delicate thing that sounds like it could blow away given the right gust, but it's able to pull off things it wasn't capable of before: the sensual come-ons of ""Don'tcha"" require a self-assurance Syd hadn't quite developed yet on <i>Purple Naked Ladies</i>, and she injects ""Shadow Dance"" with a been-here-before poise of someone at least a decade her senior.</p>
<p>She's writing hookier songs, too. ""Sunset"" unfurls with precision, moments of interest arriving at a steady and consistent clip, whether it's a switch-up in the track's loping groove or a colorful melodic run from Syd. Elsewhere, ""Runnin'"" finds its sweet spot early on and then spends the rest of its duration playing around with the angle and strength of the light being shone at it. And although the Internet are still interested primarily in fusing the proggier elements of experimental jazz with the patient warmth of neo-soul, there are fewer moments here that'll have you glancing at your watch, an occurrence that happened a little too often on their debut.</p>
<p>But while <i>Feel Good</i> finds the Internet latching onto hooks with greater frequency, they haven't completely excised their tendency to meander into jam session territory where the music loses most of the direction. The album is never aimless-- they always succeed in setting a pleasant, vibe-heavy atmosphere where detours are allowed and exploration is encouraged-- but at times it does feel like the Internet still haven't figured out how to identify what to keep and what to leave out.</p>
<p>There's a proficiency at work on <i>Feel Good</i> that's undeniably impressive-- it's an album full of musicians who can play and they approach this stuff with an endearing alacrity and a willingness to let Syd do more this time around that will pay dividends on future records. She's still got room to improve where lyrics are concerned, with generic clunkers such as ""I'm a fiend for your attention"" and ""You're beautiful, you brighten up my day"" exposing her as the fresh-faced 21-year-old she is. But an incremental improvement is still improvement, and <i>Feel Good</i> makes a good case that Syd, like her pals <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl</a>, isn't going anywhere.</p></div>"|18567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18567-the-internet-feel-good/|6.4|Renato Pagnani

On its followup <i>Nothing Was the Same</i>, he's thought about it some more.""Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga!"" he screams. ""I could go an hour on this beat, nigga!"" The song, ""Tuscan Leather"", which opens the record, is six full minutes long with no chorus, a point Drake is eager for us to absorb: ""This is nothing for the radio/ But they'll still play it though/ Cuz it's the new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go.""</p>
<p>The Drake Era has ended; welcome to the Drake Regime. Aubrey Graham's gone from an unlikely rapper to an accepted rapper to maybe the biggest rapper out, all in four years, and he's the genre's biggest current pop crossover star. Kanye has, for the moment, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"">stepped out</a> of the pop-radio wars, which means that Drake currently has no meaningful competition. On <i>Nothing Was the Same</i>, he acts accordingly-- the mansion doors swing shut behind you and he mostly stops pretending to be nice. ""I'm on my worst behavior,"" he leers, over a glowering low-end synth and an insectile battery of defaced-sounding percussion, courtesy of DJ Dahi. It's the meanest-sounding thing Drake has rapped over, and he matches it with some of his angriest lyrics, a series of sputtered ""muhfuckas never loved us"" surrounding an extended riff on Ma$e's verse on ""Mo Money Mo Problems"".</p>
<p>As Drake albums go, this is the Drakiest: Except for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay Z</a>, who shows up at the end of the album, <i>Nothing Was the Same</i> is an entirely solo affair, and all of Drake's tendencies are dialed up. Even for a rapper known for sniping at non-famous girlfriends on record, he's breathtakingly petty here: The album is four days old on the internet, and already his line ""The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree/ I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me"" from ""From Time"" is infamous, a reference so specific that the actual Courtney has had to put a padlock on her social-media life. Drake has been talking to old flames who have no equivalent soap box to climb on to talk back since before ""CeCe's Interlude"", of course, but as he's gotten more famous, they've grown more malicious, and here they feel like a series of emotional drone strikes.</p>
<p>On ""Paris Morton Music"", he relishes the thought of showing up at his high school reunion, watching everyone ""go through security clearance,"" and on ""Too Much"", he airs out his family: ""Money got my family going backwards/ No dinners, no holidays, no nothing,"" he laments, before going in on his uncle, his cousins, and even his mother: ""I hate the fact that my mom cooped up in the apartment, telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit like that's true shit."" Drake recently performed this song on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52287-watch-drake-debut-too-much-chat-on-fallon/"">Jimmy Fallon</a>, apologizing briefly to his family before tearing into it. The album title, in context, reads like a self-fulfilling prophecy viewed from the rear view, an acknowledgment that he's cutting final ties, torching the last bridges. He might like who he's become, but you can hear he doesn't expect anyone else to.</p>
<p>That's okay: Loneliness, self-afflicted or otherwise, has always been Drake's most reliable fuel. His  albums draw strength from their insularity; when everyone outside them in mainstream rap was piling on epic minor-key horns and turning their songs into armored tanks, <span>Drake drew the curtains</span>. His sound was set apart more by what wasn't there-- snare claps, hi-hats-- then what was. <i>Nothing Was the Same</i> is Drake and 40's most audacious experiment yet in how far inward they can push their sound; a lot of the album sounds like a black hole of all 40's previous productions being sucked into the center. Song-to-song transitions, which have always been melty and blurry, are more notional than ever. ""Wu-Tang Forever"" is a sunken glimmer of piano with a tiny tag of RZA's voice, screaming ""It's Yourz,"" before shading, at some point, into ""Own It"".</p>
<p>There is no uncomplicated forward motion in Drake songs; usually one small element worms forward while everything sits around it, a haze of rhythmic and harmonic indecision. Drake continues his qualified, complicated claiming of Houston on <i>Nothing</i>, rapping ""I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it"" on ""Too Much"". But the only quality his music shares with Houston rap is its vague relationship to momentum. On ""Started From the Bottom"", the bass isn't even a settled pitch, but a buckling floor beneath the destabilized-sounding pianos, which scrabble down its side. ""305 to My City"" sits almost completely flat, a ticking snare the only indication of a pulse.</p>
<p>The only thing tumbling endlessly forward, of course, are Drake's words, one emerging breathlessly after the other. He has never boasted many of the skills that define a technically skilled rapper, but he has cleared away any obstacles to his tangled thoughts in 40's muted music and let his wordy lines climb up the walls like kudzu. To live in Drake's music is to come away with his words smudged on you like newsprint ink. His eye-rollers and his stunners are all linked together, one long runaway train of sentiments: ""I wanna take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation/ And influence a generation that's lacking in patience/ I've been dealin' with my dad, speaking of lack of patience/ Just me and my old man, getting back to basics/ We been talking about the future and time that we wasted/ When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing,"" he raps on ""From Time"". It's hard not to feel exhausted, slightly, after an album's worth of these torrents.</p>
<p>You sense that Drake is exhausted, too. There is an intriguing whiff of third act rot hanging in the air on <i>Nothing Was the Same</i>, and because Drake is such a deft micro-manager of his own narrative, he's drawing our attention to it, telegraphing it in his lyrics and dramatizing the sense that whatever he does after this album, it can't quite be <i>this</i> again. He's ""somewhere between psychotic and iconic"" on ""Furthest Thing"", promising to ""break everyone off before I break down.""</p>
<p>There are big, friendly singles as well-- notably, the bar-mitzvah floor-filler ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", which borrows its smoothly bumping glide from ""Sexual Healing"". The song is terrific, one of Drake's best pure pop songs ever and instantly a standard. It is also out of place on this dimly lit album, which is the most morose and triumphant of Drake's career. ""My life's a completed checklist,"" he boasts on ""Tuscan Leather""-- for Drake, it's another reason to feel superior. But it's also what you say right before you die, and I can't imagine an admission more depressing.</p></div>"|18511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18511-drake-nothing-was-the-same/|8.6|Jayson Greene

The surprising part was how she shifted from the more character-driven garage-rock she helped create with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls"">Dum Dum Girls</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls"">Vivian Girls</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28336-frankie-rose-and-the-outs"">the Outs</a> to romanticized, Reagan-era dream-pop, a genre that all but requires putting form before flair (see also: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/"">DIIV</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/"">Wild Nothing</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22753-lotus-plaza"">Lotus Plaza</a>). The main lyric in the chorus of <i>Interstellar</i> highlight “Know Me” actually went “don’t know me,” which felt apt for a record with a sharp and subtly diverse array of songs that revealed the range of Rose’s talent but not much about herself. Unfortunately, by making an exact replica of <i>Interstellar</i> minus the sharp and subtly diverse array of songs, <i>Herein Wild</i> reveals the limitations of that range while turning its predecessor’s personality void from a cost of doing business into a serious liability.</p>
<p>It’s futile to listen to <i>Herein Wild</i> without succumbing the urge to compare it to its predecessor; in fact, the sequencing is so similar that it damn near dares you to do so on a track-by-track basis. As with “Interstellar”, the leadoff here boasts a scene-chewing verse where Rose sings with the timbre of a touchtone phone before an anticipatory, on-the-one bass-drum thump guides her out of the vaporous reverb. Only you lose the knee-buckling dynamics of “Interstellar” and instead get a smooth ascent to one of <i>Herein Wild</i>’s 10 lilting and lightly pitched choruses. As with “Gospel/Grace”, the third song here is sleek and silvery indie-pop, but instead of flowing like liquid mercury like its <i>Interstellar</i> equivalent, “Into the Blue” sits in place like a glob of puffy glitter paint. <i>Herein Wild</i> is, once again, identically bisected by a beatless vocal showcase; previously, “Pair of Wings” wisely used Rose’s voice for texture, looping and weaving soft and silken harmonies. “Cliffs As High” at least acknowledges a new influence in Björk by demonstrating a similar obsession with altitude and surprisingly angular melody. But it’s the exact opposite of “Hyperballad” in every conceivable way, dozing off waiting for a more forceful vocalist who can counter its somnambulant string arrangement.</p>
<p>We could seriously do this for all 10 songs, but lead single “Sorrow” about sums up the disassociation between her ambitions to sound bigger and smaller (i.e., more ostensibly “personal”) at the same time. Ignore, if you can, how “Sorrow” has the same drum pattern as “Know Me”, since that song pretty much nicked its own from the Cure’s “Close to Me”, a sort of “Be My Baby” public domain entity for artists of this stripe. It’s also easy to condone the lyrics throughout <i>Herein Wild</i> trying to express more individual desires through the same water/dream/sky vocabulary that kept <i>Interstellar</i> so purposefully vague. More important is how “Sorrow” gives you an idea of what Rose meant when discussing the influence of film soundtracks on <i>Herein Wild</i>, in that there are real strings rather than synthesizers and songs not entirely indebted to strict verse/chorus structure. Yet the added orchestration adds bulk rather than depth; the strings arrive exactly when you’d expect and add another layer of syrupy sheen rather than counterpoint, the bridge doesn’t introduce any new melody or dynamic shift and the fake fade-out just kills time.</p>
<p>The misallocation of resources is even more pronounced when Rose tries to hearken back to <i>Interstellar</i>’s rawest rock song (“Night Swim”). “The Depths” makes a literal callback with its introductory lyric (“swimming across the water”), and its murky, bass-driven arrangement at least recalls a different iteration of the Cure (<i>Pornography</i> rather than <i>Head on the Door)</i>. But even when it tries to menace, the overwhelming takeaway from <i>Herein Wild</i> is just how edgeless it is, bearing the consistency, texture and sickly sweetness of a circus peanut.</p>
<p>It’s not like Frankie Rose forgot how to write a catchy song and there are enough here where you wonder if it would be heard as “promising,” had it come from a new band as opposed to someone more familiar. But that’s the paradox of <i>Herein Wild</i>: it might be subject to less scrutiny had it not followed <i>Interstellar</i>, but then again, it might not be subject to scrutiny <i>at</i> <i>all</i>, and simply filed away with any other competent and unexceptional dream-pop. Besides, what’s the point of pretending <i>Interstellar</i> doesn’t exist when <i>Herein Wild</i> does the exact opposite? As the saying goes, the strict imitation of <i>Herein Wild</i> sincerely flatters its predecessor; it just doesn’t do the same for the person who made it.</p></div>"|18512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18512-frankie-rose-herein-wild/|6.4|Ian Cohen

Her debut single, 2011’s 4 Non Blondes-sampling “Put Your Hearts Up”, was a generic Disney radio tune that she now publicly disavows. Apparently asserting control over her career, she's now dabbling in nostalgia, as is instantly clear when<span> Hollywood strings and doo-wop vocals kick off the 1950s-styled <span>“Honeymoon Avenue"", the first song from</span> her debut album</span>. But why should you care about any of this? Because the minute her wordless vocals cut through the canned backing, they demand attention; her voice is smoky, world-weary and featherweight all at once, and the first thought that should come to mind is how did you stumble on this old Mariah Carey outtake?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That’s no small statement, but Grande is no small talent. And she’s self-aware. On an album that had a bit of a troubled gestation, the singer switched gears <i>again</i> through its making, opting for a 90s hip-hop soul vibe that awkwardly sits with the more doo-wop-indebted songwriting. Second single “Baby I” is most representative of where Grande is at this stage in her career. It’s a hodgepodge of familiar clichés, from its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6916-britney-spears/"" target=""_blank"">Britney</a>-esque “yeah yeah yeahs” to the punchy horn riffs that somehow melt into a staggered hip-hop verse. It’s a cross-generational mess of influences, and all the better for it; Grande’s boundless energy means she can power through like no one else, tying hooks into knots with her voice as if it were nothing. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Her four-octave range is almost ludicrously powerful, and though it still feels like untapped potential, she has admirable control for a 20-year-old. Though her songs are simple, every time she runs across a repeat phrase, she’ll attack it differently, and her melismatic loops and athletic scales breathe life into even the most staid of lyrics. Even the most hackneyed songs, like the <i>Grease</i>-calibre cheese of “Daydreamin"", are lifted by her intonation, and when she really sounds like she believes it, the results are fiery. Album highlight “Piano”-- a surefire feel-good radio hit in the vein of Katy Perry, but stripped lean-- benefits from Grande at her most impassioned, turning a charming conceit into a life-or-death matter as she shrieks “If I got my piano I know I’ll be okay!” Even this one feels irrepressibly old-fashioned, even if it's not clear exactly what era she's pining for this time-- how many 20 year old pop stars sing about dancing to a <i>piano</i>?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Songwriting is the album’s biggest flaw. Whether or not it’s Grande’s own inexperience or simply major label meddling sanding off the edges, <i>Yours Truly</i> is a very safe record. Mostly written by two of R&amp;B's most mawkish hawkers, Babyface and Harmony Samuels, it’s built on cliché and tradition, and written professionally to a fault. Let's just say that her personality certainly doesn’t come from the lyrics. The blandness seeps into the production as well: the Lex Luger hi-hats and slowed-down southern rap vocals on a few tracks feel remarkably neutered, as if they were sampled from <i>Kidz Bop: Trap Edition. </i>It’s all antiseptic white surfaces, but maybe that works in her favour, because there’s nothing to distract from her vocals. <br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">“I wanna say we’re going steady/ Like it’s 1954,” Grande sings on one of <i>Yours Truly</i>’s most earnest ditties, “Tattooed Heart"". It’d be tempting to label her with the Grammy-baiting title of ""old soul,"" but that’d be a bit diminutive-- she’s just a huge talent that admires her forebears, and knows their tricks very well. If her debut album has a strength, it manages to skirt all kinds of retro with ease, not quite pastiche and certainly not your typical 2013 pop album. Ending with its one concession to EDM, the feel-good stomper “Better Left Unsaid"", Grande insists that she’s “gonna say things” that she shouldn’t. It’s a low-key sort of rebellion, but it’s encouraging-- if she owns up to that promise, there’s not much that could stop that voice from taking over the world.</span></p></div>"|18591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18591-ariana-grande-yours-truly/|6.5|Andrew Ryce

Read it one way and it's an allusion to the arrogance that nations are doomed to repeat. Glance again and it conjures up the lines that such behavior razes, replaces, and retraces on the land. Both readings reverberate throughout Kansas City producer Brian Leeds’ debut album as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31467-huerco-s/"" target=""_blank"">Huerco S.</a> It follows a handful of 12”s and cassettes on exemplary small labels from both sides of the Atlantic-- including Opal Tapes and Future Times-- and sounds like the work of an artist hitting his stride, rather than one making his first big statement. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Leeds’ focus is the hidden histories of his homeland in the American midwest. He signposts as much with titles like “Quivira” <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quivira"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">named for a mythical place “discovered” by a Spanish explorer in the 16th century</a>, “Canticoy”, a word of Native American origin that means a lively social gathering, and “Monks Mound (Arcology)”, which is an ancient earthwork in Illinois. References aside, his music is heavy with layers, symbols, and signals. Form wise, he takes futurism’s theme tune-- techno-- and filters it through yesterday’s technology: cassettes, synths, and cheap software. The ensuing collision of temporal zones creates a bewildering, all-encompassing present, which might be why <i>Colonial Patterns </i>presents a soundtrack for both blunting jet lag and long road trips in which the landscape is continuously cut and framed by the windshield window. </p>
<p class=""p1"">“Plucked from the Ground, Toward the Sun” moves like cloud formations, calling to mind school science classes and the water cycle chart that detailed water’s cyclic shapeshifting from evaporation to precipitation. “Skug Commune” sounds like a forgotten quiet storm song trying to break through a broken transistor radio, or a conversation half lost down a faulty line, while the raw metallic percussion of “Quivira” evokes an image of acid rain falling on aluminum cutlery. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There are a number of contrasts and conflicts between the natural and manmade world. “'Iińzhiid” laps and rolls like water, its rhythms reflecting and refracting into an infinite horizon. On “Struck with Deer Lungs”, the circling sub-bass turns with the exhausted pallor of an ancient ceiling fan. Lead single “Prinzif” is weighted with a creeping anxiety that smacks of <i>Twin Peaks</i>, a not-so unusual relationship when you consider the cult TV show is probably the most successful illustration of contemporary culture’s fear of the ancient/(super)natural and modern/manmade worlds colliding. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course, <i>Colonial Patterns </i>does not exist in a vacuum. There is dialogue with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"" target=""_blank"">Actress</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"" target=""_blank"">Laurel Halo</a>’s handling of techno as a form not immune to time, one that can disintegrate just like the vast metropolises that inspired it, leaving fragments that distill into something new once again. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16031-replica/"" target=""_blank""><i>Replica</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28042-forest-swords/"" target=""_blank"">Forest Swords</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28042-forest-swords/"" target=""_blank""><i>Engravings</i></a> are also relatives, for their exploration of the nature of memory and excavation of history respectively. Like his contemporaries, Huerco S. seeks to unearth new languages-- trace new patterns-- within established musical world orders. In his hands, techno is a folk music in the traditional sense: a music that carries remnants of the past into the future. The final track “Angel (Phase)” is both culmination and affirmation of his archaeological digs: a vision of an ancient ambient techno gathering bathed in campfire light and dreaming into the night.</p></div>"|18520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18520-huerco-s-colonial-patterns/|7.9|Ruth Saxelby

<p>Looking at his set of 2013 releases that followed, including the singles <i>SW9</i> and<i> Jetée/Desire</i>, the differences are striking: the muted tones and symbols of wealth and gloss have been thrown out the window for oily splashes of rich color and crude, swirling spray. These aesthetic choices mirror Norris' experimentation with new tones and textures, and his new EP<i> Stay/True</i>is the fullest document of that experimentation thus far, a five-track collection balancing the new murk and sprawl with melodic populism.</p>
<p>The flag-bearer for said murk and sprawl is the quasi-title track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15871-stay-true/"" target=""_blank"">""Stay True""</a>, a seven-minute piece that unfolds slowly and deliberately rather than immediately exploding into ecstatic territory. Built around an arpeggiated synth spine and a shifting tapestry of hand-claps, ""Stay True"" eschews a single, sustained peak for something like a sine wave: it never quite reaches a euphoric climax, but rewards patience in its slow development. It's quite unlike anything on<i>Kingdoms</i>. Subsequent track ""Your Light"" opts for instant engagement, but still surprises, its distant, ghost-in-the-machine beat springing to life with an analog crackle. Instead of opting for his standard sampling, Norris lays down a vocoder-affected vocal that ripples through the song like a ribbon of caramel through a carton of chocolate ice cream.</p>
<p>The EP's closer, ""Together,"" splits the difference between those two tracks-- warbling tones inhabiting a region between synth and vocal hang and drift over an ominous, patchy chug built on a field recording. Norris also uses<i> Stay/True</i>to play with the EP's very structure, reserving one track for analog release and another for digital release. The former, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16050-trust-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Trust Me""</a>, is a traditionalist slice of soaring disco that bubbles and throbs around club queen hoots; the latter, ""And Now"", rises from forest floor roots into a straightforward dance-ready pulse augmented by twilit clicks and chirps.</p>
<p>Each song mentioned above is tightly composed and endlessly replayable, but they fail to address the issue lying at the heart of<i>Stay/True</i>: for all his skill, Norris has yet to define a truly distinct voice. Both<i>Kingdoms</i>and this EP are shot through with his appreciation for classic house, and they're undeniably confident and comfortable; unfortunately, coasting on comfort for too long tends to relegate artists to the middle of the pack. The small steps on<i> Stay/True</i>are steps in the right direction, and his recent departure from a touring/session role with synth-pop duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27831-la-roux/"" target=""_blank"">La Roux</a> to focus on Fort Romeau heralds a new depth of focus on the project. If Norris can continue the growth suggested on this stopgap release, his next effort could lift him to a new level of success.</p></div>"|18483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18483-fort-romeau-stay-true-ep/|6.7|Jamieson Cox

That's partly because longtime co-pilot Jason Loewenstein had just joined the group and charismatic founding drummer Eric Gaffney was still in the fold, but also because Barlow was fuming at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"" target=""_blank"">J Mascis</a> (""The Freed Pig"") and nurturing a brand new love with Kathleen Billus (""Perverted World,"" ""Kath""). <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKJmvdrQbBo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kath""</a> in particular is one of Barlow's true classics, and shows how heartache can inspire him. It's a fragile, tense, warped lo-fi love ballad for his then girlfriend, whom he went on to marry.</p>
<p>That marriage has since ended, and Barlow's been living with a new girlfriend for almost a year. Perhaps the new relationship has something to do with the general calm and upbeat happiness of the self-recorded/self-produced <i>Defend Yourself</i>, the first Sebadoh full-length in 14 years and, outside of the five-song <i>Secret</i> EP released earlier in 2013, the follow-up to the overproduced <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7051-the-sebadoh/"" target=""_blank"">The Sebadoh</a>. </i>In the years since that record, Barlow's been active with post-reunion Dinosaur Jr.'s awesome run, but Sebadoh has always been his place to shine and sulk. For <i>Defend Yourself</i>, he's joined again by Loewenstein and ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1602-the-fiery-furnaces/"" target=""_blank"">Fiery Furnaces</a> drummer Bob D'Amico, who came on board in 2012, replacing replacement drummer Russ Pollard.</p>
<p>As on past Sebadoh records, Barlow's material remains the real focus, though he seems oddly distant. Even when he's singing about subject matter as intimate as the fear and pain of watching kids grow up and say goodbye on the catchy ""State of Mine"", there's not much of a spark beyond the bounce of the backing music. Something he was great at during the band's stellar 90s run was wearing emotion in his vocal tone: you could feel the pain or elation in his voice, even if you weren't paying attention to the words. On <i>III</i>'s ""Renaissance Man"", he sang, ""Violence is cool/ One of two things real,"" and you could tell he meant it. Here, there are no jarring moments-- the collection lacks fight. Across the board, the vocal lines are mostly forgettable, and the singing's flat.</p>
<p>Barlow once had a knack for tossing off instant indie rock classics, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11981-bubble-and-scrape-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bubble &amp; Scrape</i></a>'s ""Soul and Fire"" and ""Cliché"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15522-bakesale-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bakesale</i></a>'s ""Magnet's Coil"", ""Not a Friend"", and ""Skull"", or <i>Harmacy</i>'s ""On Fire"". On first listen, you knew these were special, even when they were understated. Loewenstein, on the other hand, though he's lodged memorable songs over the years, has never been as consistent a songwriter. His primary contribution, similar to Barlow on the Dinosaur records, has been to serve as a dynamic and textural contrast. But on <i>Defend Yourself</i>, outside of the ballads, Barlow and Loewenstein's work tends to bleed together with little to distinguish them, which makes the record feel longer than it is. Loewenstein's songs like the angular, plodding ""Beat"" and ""Defend Yr Self"" are bland 90s college rock at best; his countrified rockers (""Final Days"", ""Inquiries"") come off like neutered Drive-By Truckers.</p>
<p>Barlow manages a few strong moments, like opener ""I Will"", a song that feels like it could last. It resonates in part because of its directness; this time it's Barlow who's leaving, and he's proud of finally taking charge: ""Someone else/ Has found her way into my soul/ Things have changed/ No longer need to be with you."" The fear of leaving he's shown on past Sebadoh (and Dinosaur) albums is replaced with resolve; it's kind of like seeing Hamlet finally take action, and it's a satisfying, bloody moment. But it's also an exception. On the whole, Barlow's songs on <i>Defend Yourself</i> sound self-satisfied, with an almost embarrassing ""I'm doing this for <i>me</i>"" gloat to them.</p>
<p>When I saw <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoUv_ntXV-4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sebadoh live in 1991 at Maxwell's</a>, in support of <i>III</i>, Barlow was in rare form, playing taped gags on a boombox between songs: bits that made fun of Dinosaur, J Mascis, indie rock, Sebadoh themselves. It felt like therapy and catharsis. It felt punk. Most importantly, it felt <i>necessary</i>. Naturally, Sebadoh grew up and calmed down a little during their Sub Pop years, but that progression made sense (especially after Gaffney left in 1994), and they were rarely boring. The best that can be said of <i>Defend Yourself</i> is that it isn't embarrassing; they didn't lose the plot like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"" target=""_blank"">the Pixies</a>, and it's better than <i>The Sebadoh</i> simply because they got out of that L.A. studio and back to their roots. But it also doesn't add anything to the story or feel like it needs to exist, which is just about the worst thing you can say about this band.</p></div>"|18482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18482-sebadoh-defend-yourself/|6.0|Brandon Stosuy

This is another album billed to the Plastic Ono Band following the revival of that name with 2009's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13460-between-my-head-and-the-sky/""><i>Between My Head and the Sky</i></a>, although the lineup remains thrillingly fluid. We get a return of sorts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a> Mike D and Ad-Rock, plus supplementary work from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"">tUnE-yArDs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/778-nels-cline/"">Nels Cline</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3503-uestlove/"">?uestlove</a> among others. There's even room for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10413-lenny-kravitz/"">Lenny Kravitz</a>. Steering the ship alongside Ono are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2453-sean-lennon/"">Sean Lennon</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/832-cornelius/"">Cornelius</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/759-cibo-matto/"">Cibo Matto</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2025-yuka-honda/"">Yuka Honda</a>, with the latter clearly exerting a strong influence over the blaze of color that streaks through its 13 songs. Honda and Ono are a great match, both clearly in love with bringing whimsical touches to their music, both enviably adept at bridging the divide between the sublime and the ridiculous.</p>
<p><i>Take Me to the Land of Hell</i> is unmistakably a party album, albeit one pierced by familiar anti-war and pro-peace fascinations. Ono's nothing if not consistent, leaving little doubt about her motivations throughout, principally because she spends a decent amount of time demonstrating how she cares little for the vagaries of metaphor. ""Bad Dancer"" is simply about how she's a bad dancer, something that causes her to collapse into giggles at one point. The track times are often brief, causing the songs to resemble little insights into Ono's thought process, delivered with the saddened glow of a torch singer (""There's No Goodbye Between Us"") or diverting into spoken-word passages strung across raging, <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Zapp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zappa</a>-style funk workouts (""7th Floor""). Sometimes all those tendencies get mixed up into one song; ""Cheshire Cat Cry"" is a standout, full of stop-the-violence lyrics, big soloing (presumably from Lennon), and spiraling 70s Moog twists.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of guests and musical digressions makes the overall focus blur on occasion-- the thumpingly trad guitar grind of ""N.Y. Noodle Town"" causes the buildup of energy to dissipate drastically, but there's a more considered and quite beautiful comedown moment in the string-laden title track that follows. Something this record does a little better than <i>Between My Head and the Sky</i> is show off Ono the musical omnivore, shifting across multiple disciplines, demonstrating how divergent universes are not quite so different after all. There are showtunes melting into trip-hop then segueing into avant rock. In Ono's world there are no boundaries between styles, just natural pathways leading from one to the other. There's a ton of cultural clutter here, but in a sense there ought to be. After spending so long hoovering up the arts, Ono spits it all out in a glorious mess, leaving her listeners to sift through the debris.</p>
<p>Like most records that lack a central stylistic thrust, <i>Take Me to the Land of Hell</i> often resembles a great collection of tracks instead of a coherent overall work. Indeed, this album was premiered track-by-track on Ono's <a href=""http://yopob.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> prior to its release, which suggests that someone behind it felt some hand-holding was necessary instead of dumping the whole album out at once. It takes an effort to reach the spot where it sinks in as an overarching piece, but that ties back to more challenging Ono musical projects, where time and patience are key elements in the listening process. For ""Moonbeams"" she even gets her wail on, making it ache as hard as the spread of a dull blue bruise. It's there that Ono still performs most effectively, using tone and gesture to say far more than most of her straight ""message"" songs. In among the ebullient atmosphere of this record, there's a voice in there that says: ""I hurt, too.""</p></div>"|18494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18494-yoko-ono-plastic-ono-band-take-me-to-the-land-of-hell/|7.0|Nick Neyland

Ji-yong, a national figure since rising to prominence in the enormously popular and quite good Korean boy band Big Bang, has been fleshing out his solo agenda, which so far has seen 2009’s so-so solo debut <i>Heartbreaker</i> and the more exploratory 2012 EP <i>One of a Kind</i>. (Setting up a career trajectory not unlike that of Justin Timberlake, many have noted.) Both sold extremely well-- at this point, G-Dragon was pretty much just breaking records set earlier by G-Dragon-- but <i>One of a Kind</i> suggested a more frenetic and singular style, best exemplified by the magnificent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ULhmadHkg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Crayon”</a>. That song represented a logical collision of fluorescent, pound-the-alarm EDM, the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGoTMUMMt6o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tomahawk chop chant</a>, and G-Dragon’s referential, sharp rapping; every element throbbed with electricity. But it was an exception, as the quality of his music hasn't always matched his innovations as a style icon. At the moment, G-Dragon is getting more <a href=""http://www.complex.com/covers/g-dragon-interview-september-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">press for his swag </a>than his sound.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The highlights of G-Dragon’s new solo album <i>Coup d’Etat</i> remedy that, but they only go so far. The guest spots-- Missy Elliott, Baauer, Sky Ferreira, Diplo-- are obvious attempts at crossover that are alternately clumsy and clever. Where Missy raps with a sorely missed vitality on the exuberant “Niliria”, a high-velocity flip of a traditional Korean folk song that also features playful rapping from G-Dragon, the midtempo ballad “Black” features a listless Sky Ferreira providing a hook (“If you ask me what happiness is/ Your smile under the sun/ But I’m always on the run”) that feels stitched on and focus-grouped. (On the Korean version, YG president Yang Hyun-suk replaced Ferreira with ascendant YG artist Jennie Kim). The title track wiggles and wobbles in all of the right places, steadied by an assertive G-Dragon, but the straight-up rap outro feels thin and overcooked. The overt genre experimentations that often characterize big K-pop records-- and also seen on <i>Coup d'Etat</i>-- feel skeletal in comparison to his work with YG’s big ticket act Big Bang. Though GD raps and sings throughout <i>Coup d’Etat</i>, he sometimes finds himself in the uncomfortable middle, with diminishing returns.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though <i>Coup d’Etat</i> feels forced in spots, there are plenty of moments that deliver on G-Dragon’s superstar promise and capitalize on his enormous charisma. The joyous soccer chant of a single “Crooked” might just be a song you’ll play 30 times in a row and never play again, but those 30 listens are pure serotonin-fueled bliss. And while “Niliria” isn’t as wild musically as a recent convention stop suggested, it’s still a promising template where G-Dragon thrives, he and his go-to producer Teddy spin traditional fare into a mutant banger. Lead single/lazer beam capsule “Go” approximates a “Crayon”-like frenzy, and though it ends up being less memorable, it illustrates how GD can carry a song on pure energy.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With K-pop events selling out in major U.S. markets, it’s arguable that this sphere doesn't <i>need</i> a “crossover” moment, especially one this deliberate. (<i>Coup d’Etat</i> even cracked the Billboard 200 in spite of it’s two-part release and lack of a massive global single). So if you come to <i>Coup d’Etat</i> expecting some kind of revolution you'll be disappointed; it’s an intriguing listen, if not an important one.</p></div>"|18569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18569-g-dragon-coup-detat/|6.1|Corban Goble

In the late 70s, Leon produced crucial albums that defined the punk and new wave landscape for future generations, ranging from the recorded debuts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"" target=""_blank"">Suicide</a> and Blondie to the Ramones’ self-titled and Richard Hell &amp; the Voidoids’ <i>Blank Generation</i> EP (as well as the early singles from DMZ, Weirdoes and Zeros records released on Greg Shaw’s mighty Bomp! imprint). It’s easy to imagine that Leon brought a certain level of professionalism to these earliest punk sessions-- these days, Leon mostly produces classical recordings for the likes of Luciano Pavarotti, the London Symphony Orchestra and Joshua Bell-- but for his own debut album, <i>Nommos</i>, one can hear how the punks rubbed off on him.</p>
<p>Originally released on John Fahey’s Takoma imprint in 1981, Leon’s debut album joined ranks alongside such glorious catalog oddities as <i>The Psychedelic Saxophone of Charlie Nothing</i>, Joesph Byrd’s <i>Yankee Transcendoodle</i> and <i>Basho Sings!, </i>not to mention Fahey himself, prone to play guitar atop audio collages of Tibetan monks and Nazi marches. And since Takoma is also regarded as the birthplace of placid New Age guitar, releasing early albums from George Winston and Will Ackerman, one can only imagine how <i>Nommos</i> made a certain type of music listener’s teeth grind, to where the album stands alone as the most audacious and “punk” effort ever released on that label.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that it's remained out of print for 30 years. Since then, it’s found favor with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"" target=""_blank"">Fall</a> fans (Leon produced three early 90s Fall albums), fans of industrial and primitive electronic music, techno enthusiasts as well as the recent spate of noise artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30088-pete-swanson/"" target=""_blank"">Pete Swanson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Stott</a> who pair bracing noise to 4/4 pummel, to where the album fetches ludicrous sums online. Booted in the past few years, it now sees a more legitimate release. Opener “Ring With Three Concentric Discs” sets the album’s tone in a slightly schizophrenic manner. There’s a nerve-rattling metallic loop not unlike a broken fan belt thwacking aluminum siding but before long, a gorgeous warbling synth melody drifts over the noise, just smoothing down the sharp edges so that it might find good company alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11733-cluster-eno-after-the-heat-begegnungen-begegnungen-ii/"" target=""_blank"">Cluster &amp; Eno</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15165-synthesist/"" target=""_blank"">Harald Grosskopf</a>.</p>
<p>It then leads into the polyrhythmic tock of “Donkeys Bearing Cups"",  which sounds like every hi-hat, handclap, snare, rattle and thump was triggered by one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>’s showroom dummies: stiff yet strangely funky. About a minute in, Leon introduces some unidentifiable noise that does its best anticipation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>, at once blinding and body-melting. The title track again strikes a balance between skeletal beat and juxtaposed synth line that with its sense of strange negative space seems to be a subconscious template for the sorts of beats <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"" target=""_blank"">the Neptunes</a> would craft two decades later for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9658-hell-hath-no-fury/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hell Hath No Fury</i></a>.</p>
<p>The eleven-minute “Four Eyes To See The Afterlife” and seven-minute robotic rhumba of closer “She Wears A Hemispherical Skull Cap” comprise <i>Nommos</i>’s second half. And it’s here that the sparseness of Leon’s evocative metallic throbs slowly but surely steer the album away from merely being strange electronic music to drop into an adventurous DJ set into a more rarefied and unsettling space. “Afterlife” slowly develops from a near-empty clang to something approaching hypnosis. And when a female wail arises midway through the piece, it turns into this anxious slice of early 80s electronic minimalism that has few peers. It’s a strain of minimal, nearly New Age music that-- rather than dissolve your anxieties away-- gives you the night creeps.</p></div>"|18553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18553-craig-leon-nommos/|8.0|Andy Beta

As engineer at Berlin’s <a href=""http://www.dubplates-mastering.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dubplates &amp; Mastering</a>, he's mastered and cut a massive amount of dance, electronic, and experimental albums (his <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rashad+Becker#t=Credits_Technical&amp;q=&amp;p=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">credits</a> include at least 1200 records). He’s built a reputation for creating great-sounding vinyl, so it’s no shock that the first record of his own music sounds great, too. <i>Traditional Music of Notional Species, Vol. 1</i> is thoroughly clear and precise. Everything on it is boldly legible, and though there are tons of sounds intersecting and overlapping, nothing is blurry. It’s as if Becker’s mastering his own brain and transferring what he hears in his head with little if any generational loss. It’s all pretty unpredictable, sure, but he’s always in control of his busy mix.</p>
<p>What is surprising about <i>Traditional Music </i>is how singular it sounds. Becker has listened to so much music that it should be impossible for him not to copy some of it. And in fact there are moments that recall other artists (if you need a frame of reference, think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"">Black Dice</a> without the beats, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"">Fennesz</a> with the serene poignancy replaced by an prankster-ish sense of play). But while you may have heard some of Becker’s sounds before, the way he glues, melts, cuts, layers, and stretches them is unique. So is the effect of all that activity-- I rarely think of other music when I’m listening <i>Traditional Music</i>, since the connections and juxtapositions Becker makes between the sounds themselves are more than enough to occupy my attention.</p>
<p>Much of that attention-grab comes from how concrete <i>Traditional Music </i>sounds, a rarity for work this abstract. There are few sounds here that you’d automatically associate with particular notes, keys, or instruments. But every moment feels real in a tangible, three-dimensional way. Often music like Becker’s can seem dislocated from the material world, cut off from any physical events that might have created the sounds. But Becker’s mix lives and breathes in pointed, often hilarious detail. His sounds actually <i>sound </i>like things, be it growling animals, buzzing flies, distant echoes, whirring sirens, or blipping radars.</p>
<p>It’s up to you to choose which associations work, which makes <i>Traditional Music </i>a kind of sonic mood ring. Think of one track as underwater rumblings and suddenly you can hear bubbles popping, waves rolling, and depth-charges rippling; think of another as a conversation and soon every sound takes on the inflections and innuendoes of human speech. Smartly, Becker refrains from suggesting interpretations, titling half of his tracks “Dances I-IV” and the other half “Themes I-IV”. He seems so thrilled with all the possibilities in sound creation that he’s happy to let you divine the meaning in his madness. The only thing he seems to want you to do is have fun figuring it all out.</p>
<p>Given Becker’s background as an engineer, it’s tempting to see <i>Traditional Music</i> as a kind of sound-effect library or technical demonstration disc, and maybe it is. But if so, it’s similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15826-raymond-scott/"">Raymond Scott’s</a> early electronic experiments, which were lab exercises that produced engaging music. Scott tinkered with technology and pushed at the boundaries of the medium, but he was out to do more than wow laymen with his toys. His musical sensibility and thrill of discovery birthed pieces that were compelling and often even moving, regardless of how they were created. The same goes for Becker’s music. You can start by gawking at his surprising, hilarious, exhilarating sounds, but you’ll likely find many more reasons to return to <i>Traditional Music of Notional Species, Vol 1</i>.</p></div>"|18547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18547-rashad-becker-traditional-music-of-notional-species-vol-i/|7.4|Marc Masters

In a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9183-rising-fka-twigs/"">Rising</a> feature she comes across as bubbly, enthusiastic, even a little goofy. This release, a second four-track EP following her 2012 debut, triggers a dual feeling of being buried in her suffering and a sense of relief that her music provides an outlet for it all. ""I guess I'm stuck with me,"" she sighs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15811-water-me/"">""Water Me""</a>. Comparisons to trip-hop have come quickly in twigs' short career, most of them justified. It's closest to the moment where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"">Tricky</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4347-martina-topley-bird/"">Martina Topley-Bird</a> gelled to wonderfully gloomy effect on 1995's <i>Maxinquaye</i>, finding a perfect meeting point for weed-fuelled paranoia and all-consuming love. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a> collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a> is on board as producer, neatly building a bridge toward his own Tricky worship on tracks like ""2 Blunted"" from his <a href=""http://www.unonyc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">UNO</a> album <i>Stretch 2</i>. The level of detail is immense, but never too fussy. Still, the sense of space from <i>EP1</i> is largely gone-- even in its sparsest moments this is a work that bears down on you, barely allowing any room to breathe.</p>
<p>Making disparate elements work together was a key tenet of trip-hop, where a spacey quality was given room to flow amid beats that were more commonly associated with tightly wound hip-hop tracks. It's something twigs and Arca understand implicitly, unlike the small legion of pallid genre clones that followed the Bristol triumvirate of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a>, and Tricky. So on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15393-twigs-hows-that/"">""How's That""</a> we get down-tuned slabs of noise and a sound that resembles a manic ping-pong ball layered under twigs' emoting. ""Water Me"" is built around a playful vocal sample that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VIqA3i2zQw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""O Superman""</a>. At times the most striking element is the oppressive bass that swells up, bearing such weight it resembles someone dragging a gigantic rock through the desert. But twigs is the star here, her voice rising and falling in unexpected places, full of unique color, sometimes pulling you in close even if the place she's in doesn’t feel like somewhere you necessarily want to be.</p>
<p>Something striking about twigs' delivery is her desire to switch between the real and the unreal, allowing her to open up a distance with her audience whenever she chooses. On ""Water Me"" she's coated in a thin layer of FX, adding another alien layer to a music that already sounds positively extra-terrestrial. Then she’s slowly sliding down the wall again in ""Ultraviolet"", beginning the song with a clutch of highly pitched lines perforated by an icy quiver. But there's always a sense of reticence, of not letting you get too near her malaise-- a feeling emphasized when ""Ultraviolet"" slows down to total sludge at the midway point, becoming less trip-hop and more trudge-pop. When the song bursts into something resembling a sunny R&amp;B chorus it starts to wilt under the weight of too many good ideas stirred into the same pot. But she just about gets away with it, primarily because the juxtaposition never feels forced.</p>
<p>It's no surprise to discover that twigs is something of a loner, as outlined in her Rising interview. Sometimes it's hard to imagine how the collaboration with Arca even works, mainly because her music is so solitary. Twigs is only in her mid 20s, but <i>EP2</i> is the sound of someone who has lived a lifetime in their own head, and is now letting it spill out publicly in its oddly open-yet-guarded way. There's a sense of watching her grow in public, too. The progress since her first EP is strong-- if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14648-breathe/"">""Breathe""</a> from that release resembled Topley-Bird's work with Tricky a little too closely, here she's starting to shed those tendencies, settling further into her own voice, finding her own way around rhythms. Mostly there's a sense of poise amid the hurt and the distrust and the feelings of infatuation. Twigs' music taps into that moment of serenity that settles in when everything comes crashing down around you, where you accept your fate and just go with it to see where it might lead.</p></div>"|18590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18590-twigs-ep2/|8.0|Nick Neyland

When artists with historical baggage collaborate, sometimes these little expectation-defusing gestures pop up, a way to subtly prod reverent audiences into listening with new ears. <i>Bear with us, we're just putting this together on the fly</i>, they say.</p>
<p>For <i>Wise Up Ghost</i>, it's a bit of a feint. Elvis Costello and the Roots are known for many things, but neither are noted for ""relaxing."" And <i>Wise Up Ghost</i>, the more you poke at it, turns out to be one of the densely referential works in Costello's catalogue, its lyrics a series of nested self-quotes that build a Chinese box out of his old records. The grooves, from the Roots, are loose, muted, and murky, but the music glows with the unmistakable attention to detail and sense of history that the group can't help but bring to everything they touch. This isn't the sound of old masters getting loose, in other words, as much as lifelong A-students coasting a bit. </p>
<p>Although the name on the sleeve is ""Elvis Costello and The Roots"",  Blackthought doesn't show up to rap, even on the lean, snapping ""Come the Meantimes"". No one raps at any point, in fact, which seems like a missed opportunity to make something unusual happen. The only real link to hip-hop comes from Costello's reflexive, self-quoting urge: ""Wake Me Up"" and ""(She Might Be A) Grenade"" both reset lyrics from his 2004 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11704-the-delivery-man-with-the-impostersil-sogno/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Delivery Man</i></a>, while echoes of <i>Punch the Clock</i>'s ""Pills &amp; Soap"" flicker across ""Stick Out Your Tongue"". On the title track, Costello's backup vocals call back to the earlier track ""Grenade"", effectively creating an Escher staircase of himself. For Costello diehards, the multiple callbacks trigger the same ""wait, <i>how</i> many places do I know this lyric from?"" half-déjà vu that has always been one of hip-hop's deepest pleasures.  </p>
<p>At the record's low points, though, the ""legends spitballing"" vibe works against the material. Some of the songs are undercooked, or at least they begin to feel that way as the grooves stretch out past five minutes. ""Stick Out Your Tongue"", ""Come the Meantimes"", and ""Wake Me Up"" linger longer than their thematic materials deserve, and ""Can You Hear Me"" meanders through six minutes but feels nearly twice that length, a collection of slapdash ideas with no audible commitment behind them.</p>
<p>At their best, both artists are great listeners, capable of soaking up something they can use from new collaborators. On the slower, quieter tracks, you can hear <i>Wise Up Ghost </i>shade into something that sounds genuinely like a product of both sensibilities: ""Tripwire"" is a delicate 6/8 shuffle that Costello sings in his lovely high head voice, the only time his voice sounds conventionally beautiful. ""If I Could Believe"" is one of those stunning, rafter-reaching ballads Costello unfurls out of his dry, unsentimental soul every few albums, to remind us he can. On the left-field ""Cinco Minutos Con Vos"", a series of disparate parts click together: Questlove's patient, freakishly exact snare snaps, horns punch soft notes, strings churn, Costello trades vocals with La Marisoul of  La Santa Cecilia, and boom-- Elvis Costello <i>and</i> the Roots. It's not the kind of moment that will knock the long-since-formed careers of either out their deep, geologic grooves, but it's a minor revelation nonetheless. </p></div>"|18497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18497-elvis-costello-the-roots-wise-up-ghost/|6.5|Jayson Greene

His voice hadn’t changed—it was the container it came in, a synthesized and stylized sound that made Lanegan’s slurring, bluesy purr seem like rotgut whiskey trapped in a crystal decanter. Since then, Lanegan has circled closer to home; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17869-mark-lanegan-duke-garwood-black-pudding/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black Pudding</i></a>, his collaboration earlier this year with Duke Garwood, is characteristically rich and earthy, and his vocals are almost entirely absent from the icy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18087-queens-of-the-stone-age-like-clockwork/"" target=""_blank""><i>Like Clockwork </i></a>by Queens of the Stone Age, his steady side-gig over the past few years. But Lanegan’s latest full-length, <i>Imitations</i>, is more than a retreat into his cracked, battered song-shell—it’s a session of musical regression therapy.</p>
<p>That’s not a bad thing. <i>Imitations</i> is a self-effacingly-titled collection of cover songs, with most of the originals culled from Lanegan’s childhood memories. There’s a yard-sale-LP aesthetic to choices like Frank Sinatra’s dulcet “Pretty Colors”-- which Lanegan nails via pinging harpsichord, cascading arpeggios, and a vocal interpolation that’s equal parts shimmering immersion and frigid distance-- and Nancy Sinatra’s James Bond theme, “You Only Live Twice"", whose folk-based arrangement owes more to Lee Hazlewood’s lesser-known rendition. No less than three songs by the late crooner Andy Williams-- “Solitaire,” “Lonely Street,” and “Autumn Leaves”-- are chosen, and each is milked of its inherent melancholy. Lanegan wisely doesn’t try to deconstruct Williams’ buttery, easy-listening delivery; instead, he makes it chunky instead of smooth. And his tackling of “Mack the Knife” is audacious in more than concept; one of the most iconic songs of the 20th century is encased in a skeletal, finger-picked hush. Lanegan’s vocal is so subtle it almost fades into the ether, all softened consonants, sanded syllables, and sleepy humming. For a song with such a visceral lyric, it’s a missed opportunity that Lanegan turns it into a lullaby.</p>
<p>The nostalgia isn’t all Lawrence Welk-worthy. Half of <i>Imitations</i> is devoted to relatively newer artists-- the bridge being Gérard Manset. Lanegan’s faithful version of Manset’s spectral “Élégie Funèbre” sounds more like karaoke than a cover-- but it’s wholly redeemed by the fact that Lanegan rasping in French is one of the sexiest sounds the human nervous system could ever steep itself in. From there, <i>Imitations</i> proceeds in time, touching on versions of tunes by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"" target=""_blank"">John Cale</a> (“I’m Not The Loving Kind”), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds</a> (“Brompton Oratory”), Vern Gosdin (“She’s Gone”), and Lanegan’s partner in the Gutter Twins, Greg Dulli (“Deepest Shade”). Of the four, “I’m Not The Loving Kind” stands out—a celestial feat of cornball balladry that reconstitutes the freeze-dried heartache of Cale’s original.</p>
<p><i>Imitation</i>’s opening track spotlights Lanegan’s most contemporary muse: Chelsea Wolfe. The young singer-songwriter’s “Flatlands” is held tenderly in Lanegan’s lungs like an inhaled soul, trickling out slowly through parched lips. As with the Manset cover, the arrangement is nearly untouched; Wolfe’s nerve-wracked, elegantly plucked plea for simplicity is honored in full, even as Lanegan’s scorched-earth baritone devours all sentimentality, muted as it is, in an apocalyptic simmer. With <i>Imitations</i>, Lanegan gives some of the best performances of his career. That he does so with someone else’s material only reinforces the journeyman ethos he’s extolled and embodied since Screaming Trees’ breakup in 2000. Even at the group’s outset in the 80s, though, there was a reverence for tradition-- a yearning for the eternal that helped make Screaming Trees one of the least successful yet most timeless of the grunge movement’s first wave. <i>Imitations </i>may not alter Lanegan’s roundabout arc as a musical itinerant, but it’s a steady reminder of the breadth of his scope and the depth of his roots, not to mention his stature as one of the most potent voices of his generation.</p></div>"|18496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18496-mark-lanegan-imitations/|6.6|Jason Heller

With a beatific spirit that seems sent directly from central casting and a nomadic history that includes Renaissance Festival performances and episodes of street busking, Kleyn’s work eventually garnered a small but loyal following amongst fans of the era's private-press albums. Beginning with their 2011 reissue of her debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15659-love-has-made-me-stronger/"" target=""_blank""><i>Love Has Made Me Stronger</i></a>, Drag City has been reissuing Kleyn’s albums one at a time and making them available in digital format for the first time. Her third album, 1983’s <i>Return of the Silkie</i>, might just be the best of three. A semi-concept album consisting solely of harp, voice, and the occasional bark from a distant harbor seal, the album is at the very least the purest available distillation of her unique and memorable musical vision.</p>
<p>As detailed in the album’s liner notes, a silkie or selkie is a mythological half-human, half-seal creature that appears frequently in the folklore of the Scottish and Irish islands. Time and again the songs on <i>Return of the Silkie</i> make allusion to these silkies, and in Kleyn’s hands they come to serve as a symbol for man’s complicated relationship with the ocean and the natural world. A distinct sense of yearning courses through these songs, a yearning (possibly from the POV of a silkie) for freedom and an escape from the modern world into the untouched paradise of nature. Throughout the album Kleyn sings about nature with a reverential passion that many artists reserve for religious hymns or romantic love songs, balancing the tranquility of her gentle harp playing with ominous tidings for those who might seek to harm the natural environment.</p>
<p>Engaging though the album can be, suffice it to say this is a record without much potential crossover appeal. The notion of a female harpist singing pacific songs about nature and seal-women is likely something that either has some innate appeal for you or it doesn’t. Even for those of us with an avowed fondness for the once-lost albums of such folkie artists as Vashti Bunyan, Linda Perhacs, or Sibylle Baier, <i>Return of the Silkie</i> can test one’s mettle. Kleyn’s simple, direct lyrics can threaten to shift into trite post-hippie platitudes at a moment’s notice, and in places her instrumental harp passages can border uncomfortably close to new age draftiness.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, the clarity and simplicity of Kleyn’s music works in the album’s favor. Her second album, 1980’s <i>Takin’ the Time</i>, was recorded with a full band and produced with an FM-ready soft-rock polish that hasn’t allowed it to age particularly well. By stripping things back to just voice and harp, <i>Return of the Silkie</i> has a much more organic, out-of-time feel. The album was recorded close enough to the water in Laguna Beach that the barks of harbor seals can be heard in the background-- yet another of the album’s quirky little details that might serve as a litmus test to measure how jaded and/or grumpy a given listener might be. At any rate, the album’s naturalistic production is a fine match for the effervescent likes of “Iaqua,” or the instrumental title track, on which Kleyn’s harp notes effortlessly mimic the shimmer of sunlight and sea spray.</p>
<p>The album’s most intriguing track is the one which deviates the furthest from its nature themes. “Hello Mister Drifter” details the meeting between a lonely young woman and a mysterious drifter in a fashion that manages to be at once poignant and unsettling. “I know that I’m ugly and that I’m just 13,” the song’s narrator sings to her new acquaintance, “but I don’t think you care. You’ve got smiles for me and you.” Needless to say, a song written in this vein today would almost certainly wind up as a dark cautionary tale, but here it is treated with Kleyn’s typical breeziness and sunny good will, ending by all evidence with a budding new friendship between two lonely souls. It’s a track that serves as another small indicator of just how far removed <i>Return of the Silkie</i> is from the contemporary musical landscape. This peculiar sense of distance and otherness serves to summarize some of appeal of vintage private-press albums in general and helps to make <i>Return of the Silkie</i> the beguiling point of departure that it is.</p></div>"|18555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18555-carol-kleyn-return-of-the-silkie/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

But last year, the label added a release by Danish house producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30413-tomas-barfod/"" target=""_blank"">Tomas Barfod</a> to its catalog, and 2013’s <i>Show Me The Future</i> compilations have seen Friends Of Friends expand outward in pretty much every geographical direction. Berlin-based Australian <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30838-kyson/"" target=""_blank"">Kyson</a>-- aka Jiam Kellet-Liew-- is their latest full signing.  Liew's debut album <i>The Water’s Way</i> has an exotic but familiar feel to it, like the label's gone on vacation down under to find music that hews close to their established style but with a whole new set of sounds and ideas.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Liew's work owes as much as to the more mawkish aspects of trip-hop and chillout as it does to, say, Shlohmo’s scorched naturescapes, and like that producer, he likes to blend more acoustic sounds with implacable electronic ones. Opener “We’ve Been Inside For Too Long” is a good barometer for the whole record; there’s no denying the appeal of its lapping ebb and flow, but the pseudo-operatic vocal samples and world music touches could push it over the edge for some. Most of <i>The Water’s Way</i> has that same formula, piling a bevy of sound effects and Orientalist-style instruments on gentle beats that are more anchoring than assertive. There are exceptions; “No Such Thing As Me” rides a slow-motion gallop to its climax, while the jumble of “My Mother’s Eyes” recalls the early work of the percussion-obsessed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30105-shigeto/"" target=""_blank"">Shigeto</a>. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If a sickly sweet sentimentality is at the heart of Liew's style, it can work in his favor just as often as it works against him. “She Said To Me Quietly” and “How Long” both have unapologetically huge build-ups based off of driving melodies, where he pours his energy into driving the tracks forward rather than dressing them up with ornate accoutrements. The way the central synth motif on “How Long” swells and eclipses everything else is downright thrilling on such a passive record-- it smoulders and overtakes like it’s trying to run the rest of the track into the ground, a perfect centerpiece that keeps <i>The Water’s Way</i> from wafting away on its own pleasant breeze.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though a few of the tracks mold sampled vocals into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a>-inspired cipher operas, Liew separates himself from so many producers dealing with the same self-consciously pretty sounds by sticking mainly to his own voice. And while he’s not writing full-on verse-chorus-verse songs here, these lead lines tend to give each track an indie-friendly structure, something to follow along amidst all the wave-your-lighters-in-the-air swaying. There’s a polished, almost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"" target=""_blank"">Coldplay</a>-esque sheen to his voice which could, again, turn potential listeners off: the chopped-up croon of “My Mother’s Eyes” definitely errs on the wrong side of maudlin, but on “Missing Things” he moves closer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>’s white boy soul.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Like a good portion of the Friends Of Friends discography, <i>The Water’s Way</i> is most concerned with cultivating its constant state of atmospheric beauty. It’s not always entirely clear what the record is trying to be-- there’s a big gulf between the delicately drifting opener and the straightforward and woodsy folk of closer “Shadows Cross”-- but it strikes a fine middle ground anyways. There's a little bit of newcomer syndrome when it comes to setting himself apart from the pack, and his debut turns out to be a fine attempt that sometimes gets bogged down in its own heart-on-sleeve emotionality. But Kyson has the tools and the talent to dig himself out, and if nothing else <i>The Water's Way </i>reveals a promising addition to an already overcrowded sector of electronic music.</span></p></div>"|18416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18416-kyson-the-waters-way/|6.5|Andrew Ryce

Music that nods to a previous generation's styles also faces the pitfall of knowing how those styles ossified when their listenership aged-- a combination of more self-awareness and more conscious grabs for half-comfortable adaptation-- and artists are trying even more stringently to avoid it. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28006-holy-ghost/"" target=""_blank"">Holy Ghost!</a> appeared on the scene near the end of the DFA-dominated indie-house movement's first peak, and managed to capture their stake in that scene with a couple fantastic releases (2007's “Hold On”; 2010's “Static on the Wire” EP) and an ensuing album that, though slightly uneven, pointed towards a promising future. Too bad that future was contingent on the party going on forever-- nowadays listeners who cut their teeth on that sometimes overamped mid-00s heyday would sooner prop up their feet than get up and move them.</p>
<p>Naturally, Holy Ghost!'s second album, <i>Dynamics</i>, addresses that condition by pulling at all the strings its title implies. Their brightest disco/house tendencies, and the deep emotional highs that came with them, are heavily offset with an introspective melancholy or ruminative ambivalence that asks instead of urges. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15227-holy-ghost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Holy Ghost!</i></a> put their heart deep in their grooves, where it could be drawn out after repeated listens; feelings that came across as insinuations at first gradually moved inescapably to the forefront. The songs here, meanwhile, lay it all out in detail from the start: late-night phone calls that feel like cheap stage productions in an attempt to scramble back to reconciliation (“Okay”), the summer-haze energy drain that keeps aspirations from going anywhere until anxiety sets in (“Dumb Disco Ideas”), the Bloomberg-era NYC party grind that's turned the Manhattan/outer borough clubhopper circuit into a two-way route (“Bridge and Tunnel”). This is a record that sounds like it's meant to express little more than what a drag it is to try and maintain that youthful energy in the danceclub world-- including from the music-wonk side, if “Dance a Little Closer” is any indication (“And there'll be no big changes/ there'll be no asinine punchlines/ OK, one's fine”).</p>
<p>The obviousness of the lyrics isn't a huge problem. Cheap words sound like a million bucks with enough vision behind them, but Holy Ghost!'s unfocused attention is so divided between a bunch of new musical ideas that getting something to click on all fronts is a rare occurrence. As singles-and-filler as <i>Holy Ghost! </i>seemed, it did all fit together, one or two tricks done appealingly rather than half a dozen that scatter across a wide-grouped target. Emerging out of the old Brooklynite neo-disco wheelhouse of six years ago into something transitional shouldn't have to mean Zeliging one's way through Aspartame Fleetwood Mac (“I Wanna Be Your Hand”), a strip-mall suburb of Phoenix (“Changing of the Guard”), or the overblown beach-cruiser bombast of late 80s AOR-pop ballads (“It Must Be the Weather”).</p>
<p>So after throwing every kind of stylistic detour into the year-and-a-half recording process that eventually gave us <i>Dynamics</i>, it's the stay-the-course dancefloor material that proves the most rewarding. It's definitely not as of a type as their previous synthpop-skewing material was-- “Bridge and Tunnel” is big-budget Italo a'la Kano, the intricate armada of synthesizers on “Cheap Shots” draws a clear line from mid-80s Manchester electro back through the Berlin School of progressive electronics, and “Dance a Little Closer” and “Dumb Disco Ideas” are ür-DFA in IMAX. Nick Millhiser and Alex Frankel can still crank out the heavy jams if they want to, and while half of the album feels overstuffed and overproduced, that hugeness does them a favor when it's applied to the pure dance cuts. Frankel's voice is still distinct, too-- clipped, sawed-off, and cool without being lifelessly aloof. (It helps when you can bring in Nancy Whang to push up the <i>oomph </i>on nearly half the tracks.) Unfortunately it's still too scattershot, proof that too many ideas can be even more of a detriment than not enough. That latter scenario held back their early work a little, but that's excusable; their first singles and the album that followed were the work of a band that was trying to figure out who they were. It's just a bit of a letdown to hear them, more than five years into their career, not having entirely answered that question.</p></div>"|18498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18498-holy-ghost-dynamics/|6.3|Nate Patrin

For rap fans and casual radio listeners alike, the deeply accented “Tru!” ad lib or the equally joyous “2 Chaiiiinz” have taken on a Pavlovian quality, signalling the immediate thrill of 16 bars of pure absurdity and dirty jokes. Even when the punchlines don't land quite right, it's impossible to turn away. There's a certain exuberant commitment to the delivery, and that voice, which sounds pinched yet fully possessed. Listening to 2 Chainz is a compulsive act.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Leading up to the release of the first 2 Chainz album, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17092-based-on-a-tru-story/"" target=""_blank""><i>Based on a T.R.U. Story</i></a><span>, these qualities seemed like telling indicators of a new rap superstar on the rise. Accordingly, that album was an event, the product of the rapper formerly known as Tity Boi’s unlikely decade-plus career finally coming together in one release. In contrast, the follow-up, </span><i>B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time</i><span>, arrived with almost no buzz, each of its promotional singles seeming to generate less excitement than the one before.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Yet </span><i>B.O.A.T.S. II</i><span> in many ways gets closer to the essential 2 Chainz appeal, perhaps unsurprisingly for an album focused on “me time.” It trades in the attempts at being a blockbuster project for a laundry list of ""whoa, cool"" moments, which begin in earnest as soon as 2 Chainz shouts out his stove by yelling ""what up stove!"" on opener ""Forks"". There's something refreshingly traditional about what a non-event the album is. It's as if 2 Chainz decided that his approach to 90s nostalgia would be not to make an album that sounded like that decade but rather one that applied the high-budget, slapped-together vibe of a minor Bad Boy-era release to the sounds of modern Atlanta. There's even a verse from Ma$e, and it's fantastic.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Much of the album's first half is what has become formulaic 2 Chainz at this point: Massive, booming beat, shouted short phrase for a hook, and non sequitur punchlines that sound like he's reading a list of one-liners out of a notebook. At its best, as on ""Where You Been"", this approach yields disjointed brilliance like ""If you wrote an autobiography you'd have to sue yourself/ Your lyin' ass/ Codeine in my wine glass."" 2 Chainz going at full tilt-- purposefully butchering the pronunciation of clothing brand Comme Des Garcons, for instance-- finds himself a riot and forces us to agree. At the same time, his approach can veer toward the latter-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a> tendency to rattle off punchlines like Mad Libs.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Also like Wayne, who drops by for a lively verse within Drake's verse on fun, douchey highlight ""I Do It"", 2 Chainz's bars can skirt the border between WTF and tasteless. On the grandiose, cinematic ""U Da Realest"", for instance, he delivers a heartfelt series of RIPs before undercutting them with the line ""I died in her cervix."" There are two pretty terrible songs that are both about uploading sex tapes to the Internet, the better of which, “Netflix”, is partly redeemed by Fergie, of all people, stopping by to rap. </span>Elsewhere, the loose approach yields duds like 90-second cocaine measurement tutorial ""36"", which is exactly the half-baked fragment its runtime promises it will be, and a misplaced spoken word intro on ""Black Unicorn"". </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>B.O.A.T.S. II</i><span> can be clumsy, but the low stakes also yield some great surprises in the album's second half. The plinking synths and rumbling guitars of Wonder Arillo's beat on ""Extra"" push 2 Chainz into a fantastically deliberate half-time flow until current Atlanta wunderkind Rich Homie Quan swoops in for a thrilling half-sung verse. ""Mainstream Ratchet"" takes full advantage of  DJ Montay and Big Korey beat with dubstep-grade amounts of low end, while ""So We Can Live"" matches <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7337-t-pain/"" target=""_blank"">T-Pain</a> to a boom-bap beat complete with record scratches, to great effect. It's here, where 2 Chainz furthers the throwback East Coast vibe with a rare stab at storytelling, and on ""Outroduction"", which offers an unusually clear-eyed look at the rapper's career arc, that the reason 2 Chainz is so fun to listen to becomes most apparent.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-7b4178f6-230d-26ca-1297-500e005be3a1""><span>On ""Outroduction,"" he shares an anecdote that starts off wistful about a partner in jail calling to wish a Happy New Year. Then 2 Chainz gets the audible equivalent of a glint in his eye and shouts out-- not rhyming, just thrilled at the absurdity of it all-- ""I had to tell him: nigga it's March!"" </span><i>B.O.A.T.S. II</i><span> is an album that feels happy just to exist, a rejection of the modern idea that album releases are serious events and all the tracks that sound like they were fun to make get relegated to bonus cuts or mixtapes. The belief in the album as an entertaining product is similarly captured by the decision to include a cookbook of 2 Chainz's favorite tour recipes with the deluxe edition. 2 Chainz entertains us because he understands the wackiness of what he's doing, and he performs with a wink. He's a unique form of the American dream: The tru story of the guy who worked hard and, after a long career that could leave anyone jaded, emerged successful and seemingly less jaded than ever. <br/></span></span></p></div>"|18562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18562-2-chainz-boats-ii-me-time/|6.2|Kyle Kramer

Rarer still, though, is the sense that the Dead C are making some of their most vital, urgent, and completely cutting-edge music right now, after more than a quarter century of persistent exploration. <i>Armed Courage</i>-- their fourth record in six years for New York label Ba Da Bing-- is the mightiest work they’ve made since leaving the Siltbreeze imprint in the mid-90s. A two-track haymaker for dual cranky guitars and irrascible drums, with vocals and piano scattered throughout like an explosion’s neglected debris, <i>Armed Courage </i>pairs restraint with force, subtlety with volume and magnetism with aggression. During the last decade, the Dead C have tinkered with electronics, explored more conventional song lengths, and even released 2010’s relatively approachable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14753-patience/"" target=""_blank""><i>Patience</i></a>. But <i>Armed Courage</i> reaches back to their 90s noise squall and revitalizes it <i>in toto</i>. In turn, the Dead C deliver one of the year’s most essential rock records by ripping apart most expectations of exactly what that means.</p>
<p>The Dead C’s clangorous, demanding music could never be called casual. The fitful, almost desultory nature of the Dead C’s process, however, seems essential to the band’s success on <i>Armed Courage</i>. Michael Morley, Bruce Russell, and Robbie Yeats formed the band at the apogee of the Dunedin Sound, where their pals and peers created jangly, fuzzy pop songs, as though the 60s had been refracted through bad electronics and given a strange new accent. But the Dead C didn’t aim for a similar version of pop perfection. In large part, they could not. They were not polished and practiced instrumentalists; indeed, as the band near the three-decade mark, the members still profess to a certain technical incompetence, while generally avoiding tags such as “rock band” or “professional musicians.” (Russell's daughter, Olive, recently finished <a href=""http://vimeo.com/73436706"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a charming little documentary</a> about this disparity.) They’ve toured very rarely and, aside from the release of a new album every year or two, the trio has avoided the general promotional timesucks of the music industry. For most of their career, they’ve completely foregone all scripts, too, choosing to improvise the contents of their records in sporadic sessions of old friends and electing not to recreate those pieces when they do climb on a stage. It might be hard to believe that while listening to <i>Armed Courage</i>, a record whose pieces cohere so well that you expect them to be mapped out on a practice-room wall. Then again, this band’s been speaking its own rewritten rock language for nearly three decades. They shout it here with the sort of extemporaneous enthusiasm that comes with a shared past, not weekly band practice.</p>
<p>“Armed” bubbles up from a molten swirl, drums tracing patterns atop two guitars searching for their shape. Morley and Russell eventually reach and sustain a dynamic equilibrium with their instruments and amplifiers, with blurs of notes and the buzz of circuits cultivating a web of claustrophobia. In on-again, off-again bursts, Yeats fights against that entrapment. Sometimes, he lashes out like he’s just joined a grindcore act or trots ahead as if he’s rehearsing for a marching band. Other times, though, he disappears completely. The move epitomizes the patience of three people who’ve been playing together for so long and allows every move the band makes across these 22 minutes to have maximum impact. Yes, the Dead C play workaday rock instruments, but they improvise with the sort of communication you’d expect from top-of-the-line free jazz. You hear each member cede space to the others, massage a new element into the gyre and shift into sequences unexpected to everyone, themselves included. “Armed” sounds like a composition, but it feels entirely of the moment.</p>
<p>If “Armed” is about peaking early and finding ways to make that plateau interesting for more than 20 minutes, “Courage” is a slipstream of oscillating ideas and fragments. After staying silent for <i>Patience</i>, Morley moans occasionally throughout the track, his narcotized voice seeping perfectly into the Thorazine shuffle. At one point, the Dead C even march like a proper rock band, Yeats pounding ahead beneath sheets of screech and wail, making their influence on Sonic Youth and the mass of noise-rock that followed painfully clear. Minutes later, though, they play as if underwater, any percussiveness relegated to a subaquatic thump and the guitars gasping for a lifeline. The trio surfaces once again, just before it fades forever into the middle distance. The Dead C have built their reputation on racket, but “Courage” proclaims they’re also very good at getting very small, or at creating music from the sounds most rock might dismiss as the ghosts living within their old equipment. “My amp makes a storm of noise even at rest. People mistake that for a hissy recording,” <a href=""http://www.furious.com/perfect/deadc.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Russell told <i>Perfect Sound Forever</i> in 2000</a>. “No, it’s a very clear recording of a very hissy sound, and that’s something people have trouble grasping.” <i>Armed Courage</i> leaves no room for misinterpretation.</p>
<p>The cover of <i>Armed Courage </i>features a newspaper photograph from 1968, when Russia invaded Czechoslovakia during the Prague Spring. A Russian tank burns, while two Czech nationals march ahead in street clothes. “As ‘a band,’ the Dead C have used images of civil unrest, illegal warfare, and destruction of civilizations for the better part of 27 years,” <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/features/the-dead-c-on-the-volume-of-images"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Morley recently told <i>Impose</i></a>.<i> </i>This glimpse of active revolutionaries quarreling with total power feels forever appropriate for the Dead C. After all, rock'n'roll, the new converts are told, is a trapdoor for absolute liberation. Grab a guitar and an amplifier, plug yourself, and tell the world how you feel for a change. You can be the shirtless Iggy, sweating and slithering across the stage, or the unhinged Keith, unfurling the coolest riff you’ve ever heard as a cigarette dangles from your mouth. But have you seen all these decades-old rock bands, touring the songs or, at the very least, the formulas and molds and sounds they constructed decades ago? That’s its own form of glorified servitude. But after 27 years, the Dead C remain a fully liberated and aware band, capable of turning rock'n'roll’s basics into incredibly unpredictable music. The Dead C are lifers, then, who are too in control of their own sound to be detained by expectations-- of their own music, of rock'n'roll, of their legacy at large. <i>Armed Courage</i> proves the longterm vitality of that sadly rare strategy.</p></div>"|18449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18449-the-dead-c-armed-courage/|8.4|Grayson Currin

Flux grafted math-rock spasticity onto Southern boogie, post-Strokes swagger, and hints of classic pop and 1970s MOR, whooshing through tricky time signatures and ever-changing textures at a neck-snapping clip. <i>Brass</i>, their latest, finds the band with something of a subtraction problem on their hands. Produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"" target=""_blank"">Black Keys</a> drummer Pat Carney, <i>Brass</i> is calmer, more composed, and considerably less concerned with just how much information in can jam into a single song, playing up everything the band plugged into <i>Flux Outside</i>'s elaborate equations without getting quite so, er, <i>quadriatic</i> about it.<br/><br/>It's a trade-off, to be sure; although the band's zig-zagging synths and tangled structures sometimes took some time to get your head around, <i>Brass</i> often seems to plays things a little too straight. Frontman Ryan Schafer's got a fine voice, an aspect that often got a little lost amidst Royal Bangs' pre-<i>Brass</i> density. At times, he sounds an awful lot like Bono, if Bono swapped the leather for flannel and stopped trying to knock the mic stand over every time he stepped to it. These guys have always known their way around a hook, they've just tended to pile them up two or three at a time or cut them into tiny pieces, letting you make your way through the convolution. Here, with Carney's help, they've stopped trying to overwhelm with peculiarities. But, by playing up the nuts-and-bolts of their songcraft, they haven't left much room for any other distinguishing marks.<br/><br/>""Octagon"" bounces like the Beatles, ""Sun Bridge"" is as close as we'll ever get to Steve Miller Band doing ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Z_OWPe6fU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Burning Rubber Tires</a>"", and there's more than a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">Strokes</a> on ""Orange Moon,"" with its reigned-in rhythms and flashes of neon. ""Hope We Don't Crash"" does a more-than-passable Springsteen; blueshammering closer ""Not-Imagined Nothingness"" might as well be a Black Keys song. These by-the-book tunes aren't bad, exactly, but they're rarely stop-you-in-your-tracks striking. Stripped over their trademark overload, Royal Bangs seem just a little afraid to stray too far from their influences, so these rarely get up to much you haven't heard done better elsewhere. Individual moments-- the Motown bassline Dylan Dawkins sneaks into ""Wallpaper,""or Sam Strattion's wriggling ""Laurel"" solo-- stand tall, but surprises are few and far between. While they'll occasionally slip a thorny keyboard ripple or three-notes-too-many solo into the fray, it's hardly a stand-in for <i>Flux Outside</i>'s pixelated weirdness.<br/><br/>Quite a few lyrics on <i>Brass</i> refer to settling down, going straight, achieving some semblance of normalcy. ""We can be happy for the rest of our days,"" Schaffer sings on ""Octagon"", if only he'd ""get a job and go to sleep."" Later, on ""Window Loops of America,"" a resigned-sounding Schaffer notes ""if was supposed to find something wandering 'round, I would've found it by now."" It's tough not to read all this as a comment on the more stable, considerably less adventurous sound of <i>Brass</i>: these guys have always balked at the ""experimental"" label-- possibly because their experiments always felt so self-assured-- but <i>Brass</i> is, by some distance, their most conventional-sounding record, a dozen relatively straightforward rock songs played with a certain gusto but considerably less of the daring, we'll-try-anything spirit that made their past work so distinctive. <i>Brass</i> is certainly an easier record to wrap your mind around than <i>Flux Outside</i>. But, with one too many good-not-great melodies and that nagging sense that these guys are holding something back, it's also a whole lot less likely to get itself lodged in your skull.</p></div>"|18489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18489-royal-bangs-brass/|5.9|Paul Thompson

And yet, while I’m willing to admit that I’ve never been to Greece, I have been to New York City, and for all of its superficial hometown pride, <i>At Home</i> actually suffers from the same criticisms as post-Giuliani Gotham: it wants to remind visitors of a cutting edge, artistic vitality fostered in the 1980s while keeping the attendant danger at a very safe distance.</p>
<p><i>At Home</i>’s mid-fi synth production begs the usual descriptors: swooning, soft-focus, the sort of thing often considered “dream-pop” for the way it reminds people of the things they use to achieve a waking dream state: sex, drugs, druggy sex, sexy drugs. But KSIA’s approach is staunchly risk-averse and gentrified. Sarah P’s delivery has the requisite breathiness and her words are suggestive, though reverb always renders her as an observer rather than a participant. The only exception is an sparingly deployed distorted effect that makes her sound exactly like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6468-karen-o/"" target=""_blank"">Karen O</a>, but despite its confrontational tone, it’s just another obfuscation. Her partner RNR’s aesthetic is also a typical bedroom producer homebrew of smudge and sheen-- no texture here would be too radical or abrasive for any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins</a> record despite its occasional nod towards harsher tones of post-dubstep or hip-hop. Nor would any retail manager in 2013 run afoul of their superiors if they played this during business hours.</p>
<p>Which isn’t exactly a selling point, since it’s hard to think of <i>At Home</i> outside the context of the dozens, if not hundreds, of aspiring, wavy synth-pop duos that remind you why <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Purity Ring</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"" target=""_blank"">CHVRCHES</a> have shot up towards festival status in such a short time. They're the exceptions in a style where most bands barely even try to establish a distinct personality, let alone write killer hooks. Certain production touches lend the songs on <i>At Home</i> variance from each other, but not much KSIA can claim as their own. The possible <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a> reference of “Room 14 (I’m Fine)” hints at punk ideals underneath a feathery, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29728-teen-inc"">Inc.</a>-like guitar figure, and the lyrics of “DIY” do the same, though “you may dream of glory/ shabbiness is your story” isn’t the kind of mission statement that makes you go wild and spray paint the walls.</p>
<p><i>At Home</i> is more successful when the music tries to assume some kind of aggressiveness, though the awkwardness presents its own set of problems. The heaving backbeat of opener “Time Only Exists To Betray Us” is neutralized by puffy reverb, while “Higher” gets rudely punctuated by a doom metal riff and dancehall chatter. Whether the latter “works” or not feels like a moot point-- it’s exciting to hear KSIA try something that deigns for rudeness, though its novelty depends on how long it’s been since you’ve listened to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem"">Salem</a>. Same for “Madmen Love”, whose juddering arrhythmia conjures an ambitious but ungainly Soundcloud remix of a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> song before its sax-soaked, arena-rock climax. Meanwhile, a bluffer’s guide to the past three decades of dance-indebted, record-collector indie-pop is formed by “Oostende”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15739-recollection/"">“Recollection”</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15949-keep-shelly-in-athens-flyway/"">“Flyway”</a>, respectively covering the 80s (Cocteau Twins) 90s (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne"">Saint Etienne</a>) and 2000s (pick a chillwaver).</p>
<p>It’s an impressive syllabus of influences, but you figure <i>At Home</i> might appeal more to the extremely casual listener unfamiliar with all of the aforementioned. It’s an enjoyable and subtly diverse listen only if you give it your undivided attention. For all of their geographic namedrops, Keep Shelly in Athens’ home is the Internet, where a single referential connection can make you forget how you got there two minutes ago. It’s all obviously figurative, but KSIA have built their rep not on touring but in the necessary manner to stay in our respective RSS feeds-- singles, EPs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16099-campus-martius/"">compilations</a> and remixes on top of remixes. But when all of their peers and collaborators are on a level playing field, equally available to the listener, does anything here inspire a conscious decision to listen to <i>At Home</i> instead?

On ""The Sing"", the ballad that opens his warm, weary new album, <i>Dream River</i>, words roll by like cloud formations on a calm day: ""Drinking…while sleeping…strangers…unknowingly…keep me company."" And afterwards there's a pause as the line hovers there, like something hanging above the doorway into the record's peculiar, intimate universe. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6640-bill-callahan/"">In the past</a>, Callahan has compared songwriting to an act of carpentry (""There's this huge block of silence and you carve little bits out of it by making sound""), but never before has one of his records embodied that feeling so richly. Each line on <i>Dream River</i> forms so slowly and deliberately it's like we're watching him whittle it out of oak.</p>
<p>Call it naturalism, polluted with the occasional puff of bleak humor. From his earliest days recording as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3843-smog/"">Smog</a>, Callahan has always been consumed by the natural world. To him, nature is often a taunt, a provocation, a reminder of the smallness of human life. Although he is among music's most astute observers of human truth and absurdity, in a Bill Callahan song, being a person is often a wry, cosmic joke. The sky can broadcast all the violently beautiful hues of, oh, say, a late-summer sunset, and what's the best we can do? ""Late Night With David Letterman"" (on <i>Apocalypse</i>'s ""America!"") and radio interviews with Donald Sutherland (on <i>Dream River's </i>""Winter Road"") and-- it's always implied, with a meta-chuckle-- Bill Callahan records.</p>
<p>Since 2007's <i>Woke on a Whaleheart</i>, the first record released under his own name, Callahan has moved counterclockwise to the rest of the world's spin. As life has become crowded with text, Callahan has, with each record, become more laconic. As people have grown (<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/308930/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ostensibly</a>) more connected, Callahan's records have increasingly embraced feelings of isolation. Those early Smog records, with their aggressive textures and anarchic sneers, thrashed in opposition to the outside world. Now Callahan sings like someone blissfully oblivious to its churn. ""I set my watch against the city clock,"" he sang on the opening track of his stunning 2011 record <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15285-apocalypse/"">Apocalypse</a>,</i> chuckling with faint surprise. ""It was <i>way</i> off.""</p>
<p>A quiet masterpiece, <i>Apocalypse</i> seemed like a culmination of Callahan's career so far, but it also had a feeling of finality to it. On <i>Dream River,</i> though, the aesthetically restless Callahan has found a few new mountains to climb. He challenged himself to make a more subdued record where the only percussion comes from hand drums and brushes, but he’s challenging himself thematically, too. <i>Dream River </i>finds Callahan tackling a question that has haunted his music for decades: What happens if the guy who once declared, ""Alone in my room I feel like such a part of the community"" makes a moving, occasionally honest-to-god <i>romantic</i> record about the power of human connection?</p>
<p>That line comes from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmsMvra1WR8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ex-Con""</a>, a song found on Smog's 1997 album <i>Red Apple Falls, </i>and it's striking to consider how much has changed in the years since. Callahan's baritone has lowered about an octave; he used to sing through his nose but now his voice (a much richer and more resonant instrument) seems to come direct from the murkiest depths of his lungs. His arrangements have also grown more sparse, and on all fronts he’s learned how to say more with less. It’s one of many paradoxes in Callahan’s music, that in abandoning a method of singing more traditionally considered “expressive,” he's actually learned how to express more. His delivery is animated by the subtlety of tiny gestures, which is why although there are maybe a total of three words on <i>Dream River</i> that a third-grader would stumble over, its musings still feel profound. “The Sing” boasts one of the album’s most undeniably quotable lines-- “The only words I’ve said today are ‘beer’/ And ‘thank you’”-- but the real joy comes from hearing him mutter, “Beer” and “Thank you” a couple of times afterwards, each time intoning it with an almost imperceptible change in tone. Somehow, each “beer” contains multitudes. </p>
<p>Callahan's learned to use negative space so well that there's even poetry in the pauses. Take ""Summer Painter"", an instant addition to his canon of great songs; for what else can be said of a song that begins, “I painted names on boats…/ For a summer” and then unfurls, glacially, like an elliptical yarn spun by a leathery old shanty-dweller who has, without question, <i>seen some shit</i>. Callahan’s learned how to use his voice like a camera (""When the hurricane hit some found it suspicious/ That I’d just since left the frame""), and here he’s shooting a wryly funny mock-epic. “Rich man’s folly and poor man’s dream,” he sings, and then pauses for effect, “I painted these.” It’s a masterful little zoom-out, and it only heightens the sense that Callahan’s playing director here, a feeling furthered by guitarist Matt Kinsey’s torrential freak-out when a storm rolls in.</p>
<p>The grandeur, though, is short-lived, and that’s the most profound and affecting thing about <i>Dream River</i>. At its core, this is a record about accepting and even embracing the smallness of human life, and how difficult that can be, given our damnably innate sense of adventure, ambition, and restlessness. For at least four minutes, though, Callahan finds peace and stillness in the form of “Small Plane”. The song is a quiet miracle; an afternoon epiphany told in dream logic and simple language to no one, because his only companion is taking a nap. And yet, what a perfect moment to take stock of things: “I really am a lucky man/ Flying this small plane.” It’s a testament to simplicity, or maybe just the power of his wistful, prismatic delivery, that a songwriter once known for his delight in intricate wordplay has never sung more stirring words than these.</p>
<p>To call <i>Dream River</i> “content” or “serene” feels wrong, because there’s still a pang of longing to it. But in all of this album's searching, it does bring back one hopeful find: that maybe the closest we can come to the thrill of wilderness is the adventure of being with another person. “I see the true spring is in you,” he sings at one point, and it might just be the happiest moment on the record. For once he’s not wishing he were an eagle or a tempest or a sunset. He is just Bill Callahan, flying his small plane with a co-pilot by his side, and for the moment at least, that is enough.</p></div>"|18491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18491-bill-callahan-dream-river/|8.5|Lindsay Zoladz

It just so happens the current moment is an exceedingly good one for the Marshalltown, Iowa quintet to reconvene after a five-year hiatus: the influence of their LPs (particularly 2005’s high watermark <i>Witness</i>) has manifested in very successful bands like Defeater and Touche Amore, while their new label Deathwish, Inc. has given music of this stripe more crossover exposure than it might have received in years previous. But their name is something of a feint: Modern Life Is War isn’t an explicitly political punk band, nor are they interested in disseminating big statements. <i>Fever Hunting</i> is a record of intense, personal reckoning, but one that doesn’t waste your time with concerns that are anything less than universal.</p>
<p>There’s not a lot of room for bullshit when you’re trying to cram five years worth of life experience into 27 minutes, and <i>Fever Hunting</i> doesn’t even have time for the kind of frills that define genre. If you come in looking for a strict hardcore record, “Old Fears, New Frontiers” is a hell of an entry point, a one-minute repetition of the title that lets you know the source material for every song going forward. There are plenty of bracing group chants to come, though MLIW aren’t as blunt elsewhere-- “Chasing My Tail” becomes <i>Fever Hunting</i>’s most galvanizing moment only after three minutes of beatless feedack and erratic guitar abuse, while the the title track releases its tendon-straining tension by coming to a full stop of shrieking feedback. The songs on <i>Fever Hunting</i> always ends up sounding anthemic, and while it might be a stretch to call it “melodic hardcore,” Jeff Eaton‘s jagged yells are shaped into knowable contours.</p>
<p>And if you expect puritanical punk, well, MLIW certainly stand by the values. But <i>Fever Hunting</i> is not “raw,” nor is meant as replacement for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RwdVtEqGPw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shows like these</a>. This is one of the cleanest and best-recorded punk records of the year; as with most productions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>’s Kurt Ballou, the hard work was done before entering the studio and his job is to make sure that the listener hears all of it. All that effort is worth it just for the snare drum in “Health, Wealth &amp; Peace”, as the precision and force you hear in each crack is something like watching Miguel Cabrera take batting practice. The sonic clarity gives the subtle variations of <i>Fever Hunting</i> a chance to expose themselves and this is particularly true of the relative moments of levity-- the part where a power chord breakdown in “Health, Wealth &amp; Peace” exposes itself as a 12-bar blues riff, the spirited coed vocals in “Cracked Sidewalk Surfer”, “Nightcrawler” taking a detour into loping, California skate-rock.</p>
<p>While accessible, <i>Fever Hunting </i>is also deadly fucking serious. The “ballad” here is called “Brothers in Arms Forever”, and Eaton yearns for nothing short of true unconditional love, barking “when I saw you after you got sick, I got choked up!!!!” the same way he sings lines like “I suspected you’ve been infected/ by the diseased discharge of the media cunt.” MLIW are a band obsessed with fidelity in both sound and in philosophy and it’s nothing you haven’t heard on a punk rock record before, a tautological code where you have to stay true to the truth and that modern life is actually ancient warfare. When Eaton shouts down “petty politics and bullshit party lines,” it’s not in reference to Washington, D.C. or some other faroff conglomerate, but the divisiveness prevalent at the water cooler and rock club, hand-to-hand combat for limited resources that turn people into emotional savages.</p>
<p>Fortunately, MLIW are righteous without crossing into self-righteousness; “Media Cunt” and “Blind Are Breeding” are proof enough that Eaton can take a blowtorch to strawmen and make it sound like a truly necessary act. But like a miniature version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4626-the-wrens/"" target=""_blank"">Wrens</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8742-the-meadowlands/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Meadowlands</i></a>, <i>Fever Hunting</i> allows you to cheat a bit and use the contextual clues to see a blue collar, workingman’s dread to these songs-- a band like Modern Life Is War takes a lot physical and emotional commitment, especially for guys in their early 30s. The title track and “Dark Water”, the two most overt “being in Modern Life Is War” moments, in particular give resonance to the primitive iconography of the album packaging, as Eaton survives off little else but principle and idealism. It’s a band influential enough to matter, but not big enough to live off of, so what keeps them going?</p>
<p>From the sound of things, it’s not just a means of venting but a way of hashing out ways to simplify one’s daily existence. For the most part, it just means to keep your side of the street clean and lead by example. There are a number of meanings to the word “Currency”, and on <i>Fever Hunting</i>’s centerpiece, the most crucial one is how it relates to being in the present moment. There are plenty of times when Eaton explores the unavoidable stresses of finance, but their absence is more notable when he barks “Your time is precious and it’s slipping away/ your friends are precious and they’re slipping away.” The important thing is that MLIW are never preachy; the last thing Eaton wants is to have punk music be used as an another means of separating people into classes. Befitting a record that begins with “Old Fears, New Frontiers” and ends with “Find A Way”, <i>Fever Hunting</i> is guided by a pragmatic hope, put into action through gratitude and reaching your hand out. In “Currency”, Eaton admits “Growing up was confusing...I might not have made it all alone/ so I thank you if you spoke to me/ or you listened.” “I thank you” is underlined in the lyrics sheet.</p></div>"|18367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18367-modern-life-is-war-fever-hunting/|7.9|Ian Cohen

It was a solid year for the Stilts: two albums that reverberated off each other, grew the band outward (the expansive “Alien Rivers”) and brighter (the exceptional “Radiant Door”) reiterating their already iterative sound. There was this excitement that circled around those two records, even for a band that winked at dusty noise pop gems from all over the world, from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_Iced_Bears"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">14 Iced Bears</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21083-13th-floor-elevators"" target=""_blank"">13th Floor Elevators</a>, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a> to the jangly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin_Sound"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dunedin Sound</a>. This is Crystal Stilts’ racket and if you’ve been keeping up with the Stilts, you know they’re really good at it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On their tenth year as a band and their third LP, Crystal Stilts press onwards, firmly rooted in every other era but their own, and demand much more of the lay listener to hang back there with them. <i>Nature Noir</i> is a curious album that cements the Stilts as a band whose steps forward seem grand in the scheme of themselves, and microscopic in the scheme of the life around them. The initial excitement that the Stilts created by resuscitating the various dark corners of metropolitan noise pop starts to fall as slack as the strings on JB Townsends’ guitar. Perhaps chalk that up to the prerequisite perspective one should have before sitting down with the band. You down with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground"" target=""_blank"">the Velvets</a> at their most booted? You down with Flying Nun Records? You down with solitary psych rock whose functioning aesthetic is more notable than its songwriting? If not, there’s an awkward sensation that the Stilts are performing CPR on a corpse.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Which is not far from the mood Brad Hargett wants to strike with his pitchy baritone. </span><span>The band aims to draw more inspiration from their outer surroundings this time out. And they do find moments of life here-- those flits and wisps when Haggett sings up in a more Dean Wareham register serve him all too well. ""Sticks and Stones"" and the lite string arrangement on ""Memory Room"" achieve those sunglasses-at-night-in-a-field vibe. Likewise, ""Future Folklore"" imagines an amazing world where CCR wore black turtlenecks and eyeliner, with Townsend's guitar going full swamp rock and the synth switched to a piano for a Little Richard riff. For all its attempts at natural spiritualism, the Stilts get the most exciting when they're either going full throttle or just drinking in a new surrounding or record. But you know the saying: You can take the band out of the anemic, soul-crushing city...</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Most of the record amounts to the sensation of watching someone hold a lit cigarette, limp-wristed, without ever taking a drag. All the morbid vivre the Stilts used to channel, all the filthy corners of NYC that used to be on display have calcified into a sort of stale energy that neither swings nor swaggers like it used to on their debut,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12381-alight-of-night/""> <i>Alight Of Night.</i> </a>When Haggart sings on the title track, ""Bring your ladder/ Meet me at the top of the world,"" the beauty of the sentiment just sort of files in the rest of the album, the rest of the band's other albums, and the rest of the bands the Stilts love. Even with the reverb dialed down, it's hard to find a human pulse in the psych-haze ""Star Crawl"" or the lolling ""Worlds Gone Weird"". The heart that Haggart seeks is beating somewhere in the past, but the Stilts' ennui is now less of a listening experience and more of an chin-scratching observation in gallery of retro ideas. You nod because you catch the reference, and you move on to the next room. <i>Nature Noir </i>is nothing if not a well-crafted, whip-smart record, but it leaves me yearning for the days when the Stilts would put passion into trying to find the pulse. Or better yet, yearning for the days when the pulse may actually have existed. </p></div>"|18493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18493-crystal-stilts-nature-noir/|6.3|Jeremy D. Larson

That <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30945-london-grammar/"" target=""_blank"">London Grammar</a> have been the latest recipients of this sort of breathless anticipation shouldn't shock-- their influences are the kind of alternative-but-still-polite acts generally favored by the prize, and they were featured on ""Help Me Lose My Mind"", a highlight from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18091-disclosure-settle/"" target=""_blank""><i>Settle</i></a>. But a cynic tempted to dismiss their downcast take on spacious, reverb-heavy pop as a calculated attempt to muscle into a sizzling market would miss out on an accomplished debut that belies the fact that this trio of Nottingham University alumni wrote and recorded their first song together less than a year ago.</p>
<p>That song-- the achingly slow-building ""Hey Now""-- is a perfect encapsulation of London Grammar's sound. It begins with frostbitten chords which are soon joined by guitars that recall the xx at their most spectral and, eventually, Hannah Reid's vocals. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"" target=""_blank"">Jessie Ware</a> has often been invoked as a point of comparison, and both vocalists understand that restraint can be far more effective than constant demonstrations of strength. On ""Hey Now"", Reid's voice emerges as an elemental power that can clear entire fields, displaying an outward composure that always provides glimpses of a staggering vulnerability lurking just below the surface. This kind of range lets Reid come at any one line from multiple angles, which gives her obsession with the fallout from heartbreak a surprising amount of nuance. When she admits to ""feeling shyer"" at one point on the album, she sounds at once exhausted, confused, and defiant-- basically anything but shy-- and later in the song, when she advises a suitor content to send mixed signals and make half-plays for her heart that ""maybe you should call her,"" it becomes a taunt rather than a desperate plea for attention.</p>
<p>There's always an emotional urgency in Reid's vocals-- she doesn't do low stakes. When producer Dot Major and guitarist Daniel Rothman find that musical equivalent to Reid's reserved sense of theatrics, the results are devastating. ""Wasting My Young Years"" starts off austere and picks up steam as it races toward a climax that never arrives-- at the precise moment you'd expect the song to launch into the stratosphere, it's yanked back to earth, satisfying through its refusal to meet our expectations. ""I don't know what you want, don't leave me hanging on,"" sings Reid as the song disintegrates into pieces, but this kind of thread-dangling is London Grammar's strong suit. They can conjure emotions without hammering you over the head with them-- on the autumnal ""Strong"", Reid sings of being ""wide-eyed and I'm so damn caught in the middle,"" plotting coordinates where romantic idealism and reality meet to disastrous results. </p>
<p>This no-man's-land between indecision and action is a common thread throughout these songs, even influencing Reid's approach to conflict. ""We argue, we don't fight"" she accuses on ""Metal &amp; Dust"", making it clear she'd rather air things out in the moment than let resentment build. Major and Rothman wisely stay out of Reid's way when she locks her sights on a target, and they use their knack for dynamics to support her in subtle ways. They help elevate a cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5245-kavinsky/"" target=""_blank"">Kavinsky</a>'s ""Nightcall"" from filler to a vital peak in its emotional trajectory, stripping it of its fluorescence and ratcheting up its inherent melancholy a dozen notches. At points even a trip-hop influence can be heard, with Portishead-like breaks popping up on and injecting much-needed propulsion into moments that might otherwise wilt on their own.</p>
<p>Due to this emphasis on compositional restraint, <i>If You Wait</i> occasionally feels a little too homogeneous, a little too tidy. It's so uniform tonally that it sometimes approaches somnambulance, its negative space becoming a liability rather than a cleverly-used tool. Then again, London Grammar seem bright enough to know there's always room for improvement: ""I've heard it takes some time to get it right"" Reid opines on ""Wasting My Young Years"", but this trio already functions like a well-oiled machine, and they've produced a stylish debut that demonstrates both their immense talent and impressive instincts.</p></div>"|18473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18473-london-grammar-if-you-wait/|7.1|Renato Pagnani

This characterization has never been entirely accurate-- the best of these bands had plenty of impressionistically emotional music that swelled with grandeur-- but much of math/post-rock was intended to be expansive and dense, and, as a result, became pretty inscrutable on a smaller, more personal level.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Over the past few years, the instrumental virtuosity and compositional complexity of math-rock has become a jumping off point for exploring a host of influences, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a>' experimental, eclectic dance music or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31132-tera-melos/"" target=""_blank"">Tera Melos</a>’ knotty interpretation of punk pop. Bassist Greg Albert, guitarist/lead singer Sam Owens, and drummer Max Almario of Brooklyn-based <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29417-celestial-shore/"" target=""_blank"">Celestial Shore</a> put their own spin on this idea, taking the wide-eyed pop psychedelia of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4746-the-zombies/"" target=""_blank"">the Zombies</a> and schoolyard weirdness of the Unicorns and running them through the filter of their jazz-rock backgrounds.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s telling that they stumbled on their sound while learning to play the entirety of </span><i>Odessey and Oracle</i><span> in their practice space before the band even had a name, eventually incorporating gold-plated vocal interplay, pop harmonies, and tightly wound bursts of wiry guitar work into their debut 2011 EP </span><i>California</i><span>. The EP also showed off the trio’s ability to write quietly personal songs surrounded by the chaos of their kitchen sink compositions, allowing the more sprawling, complicated aspects of their sound to inform, rather than overwhelm, a delightfully off kilter brand of nervy, emotional indie rock.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For their first full-length release, </span><i>10x</i><span>, Celestial Shore have crafted an album that’s almost defiantly misshapen in spite of its pop ambitions, moving away from the cleaner melodies of their first EP to occasionally get lost in a thicker web labyrinthe guitar figures and tricky rhythms. The result is an uneven record that takes one too many left turns while searching for interesting ways to communicate a confused, emotional discontent. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album's first two songs highlight the ebb and flow of <i>10x</i>. The halting, jumbled, herky-jerky flow of “Stairs Under Stars” practically begins in media res, immediately tossing the listener into a thrashing sea of competing instrumentation and fragmented lyrics. And </span>when the <i>10x</i> apex <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15054-celestial-shore-valerie/"" target=""_blank"">“Valerie”</a> follows the delirious tantrum of “Stars”, it’s an immediate palate cleanser, a fantastic example of the ways in which Celestial Shore’s mathy flourishes can underline and enhance their nuanced songwriting, using musical form to illustrate the jittery, anxious, and jealous emotional tremors that come from a gradually dying romantic flame. The album's other highlight is the odd gallop of ""Hours Minute"", a song that pushes more of the Zombies' garage psych influence to the forefront.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The remainder of <i>10x</i> gets too mired in the group's tendency to lean on anarchic fits of messy noodling (""Rabbit Hole,"" the Empress Of-assisted ""Sleep,"" ) that whip and turn but ultimately come over as navel-gazing and indulgent. When Celestial Shore use the foundation of mathy song structures and instrumentation to build strangely personal pieces of rough-edged art pop, <i>10x </i>becomes a gorgeous jewel of a record. When they lean on meandering, jammy compositions too busy to breathe, the Brooklyn trio falls prey to the indulgent tendencies that have marred math/post-rock musicians for years. </span></p></div>"|18566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18566-celestial-shore-10x/|5.8|Patrick Bowman

The duo’s 2007 debut stands as one of recent history's rare game-changing (read: replicable) pop-rock records and its success caught everyone off guard, most of all MGMT themselves. Paralyzed by songs they had the misfortune of disliking more than anyone else, Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser responded in 2010 with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/"">Congratulations</a></i>, a well-meaning, overstuffed, and reactionary record of big ambitions that were only vaguely defined. It didn’t yield a hit, but <i>Congratulations</i> gave them something more valuable going forward: moral high ground. Of course, to follow them on their new path, you needed to believe that “Time to Pretend”, “Kids” and “Electric Feel” would prove to be MGMT’s “Creep” or “She Don’t Use Jelly”, an unrepresentative, fluke hit that allowed them to become stealth operatives for uncompromising art-rock in the compromised major label system.</p>
<p>The most important part of is this narrative is believing that MGMT are victimized by <i>Oracular</i>’s commercial success, a success they won’t repeat because hardly anyone will. If <i>MGMT</i> achieves only half of <i>Oracular's </i>platinum sales, it'll still be one of the top 30 or so sellers in 2013. But judging from the once again well-meaning, overstuffed, and reactionary <i>MGMT</i>, they’ll never make a truly weirder album than their debut either. Their original, guileless mishmash of gonzo storytelling, imperious pomp-rock, and day-glo synthesizers was the work of people who had no choice but to stay true to their ideals, as they had no pretensions or even any real clue of how it would stick. That spirit gave way to a self-conscious, scare-quotes “weirdness” indicative of artists trying to micromanage what you think about them.</p>
<p>And as with <i>Congratulations</i>, there are just enough moments of cohesion to counteract the latter impulse. Though it’s impossible to know what MGMT’s goals were, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15334-alien-days/"">“Alien Days”</a> at least feels like the most successful alignment of their supposedly divergent impulses towards prog’s complexity and pop’s pleasure. At first hearing, “Alien Days” feels unnecessarily fussy in both composition and production: you get actual child (not childlike) vocals, distorted drum breaks, and what sounds like the use of all 12 major chords within the span of thirty seconds. But once you get a sense of the labyrinthine structure, every strange turn ends up being the right one, each melodic resolution a small, substantial and lasting surprise, like continually finding a dollar in your jeans.</p>
<p>But the “Mystery Disease” referenced on the third track might just be MGMT's allergic reaction to anything resembling a straightforward pop song.Like most of the non-singles from <i>Oracular</i>, “Introspection” is derived from the ornate pastoralia of Kinks and Bowie and then handed off to producer Dave Fridmann to turn it all pixellated and paisley. But it plays out as a four-and-a-half-minute distraction, with all kinds of “What’s this button do?” knob-twiddling-- windshield-wiper stereo panning, perpetually increasing distortion that drowns out the chorus, tremolo effects. “Mystery Disease” bears a sleek glam melody that gets slathered in nasal flange effects and set to booming breakbeats; here, MGMT all of a sudden reveals themselves a late-90s connection between kinda proggy UK bands like Mansun and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1135-doves"">Doves</a>, studio geeks whose rare pop songs are similarly their most beloved moments. At least on “Your Life Is a Lie”, the production serves the purpose of the lyrics, as VanWyngarden takes your perceptions through a hall of mirrors before abruptly stopping at two minutes, leaving you more confused than before.</p>
<p>That all happens during the first half of <i>MGMT</i> and in a likely nod to their vinyl-era heroes, Side B becomes a figurative record flip. With the exception of the shuffling goof ""Plenty of Girls in the Sea"", the band does away with any semblance of verse-chorus structure after its most accessible moment (“Your Life Is a Lie”), letting you know this is the <i>real</i> MGMT. And in fairness, the second half of <i>MGMT</i> shows you what they’ve been all along: a centrist indie rock band on a major label, only now you have to believe those two circles overlap way less than MGMT are letting on. The “weirdness” is just a matter of relativity at best, and at worst, a clever marketing ploy to curry critical favor to hedge against its commercial prospects. If you still think KROQ is seeking to add deep cuts from <i>MGMT</i> to its playlist, then yes, the likes of “Astro-Mancy” will sound awfully bizarre slotting in between bands like Bastille and Imagine Dragons, two examples of acts whose synth-spiked, genre-straddling electro-pop is somehow nominally “indie” thanks to MGMT.</p>
<p>But for all of their talk of going off the deep end, <i>MGMT</i> ultimately takes on a less flattering image, of a band wading in the indie mainstream. Hermetically sealed echo chamber “A Good Sadness” is a wallflower’s idea of space disco and indistinguishable from most anything on the most recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5531-bear-in-heaven/"">Bear in Heaven</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16440-bear-in-heaven-i-love-you-its-cool/"">album</a>, except MGMT eliminate any sort of consistent rhythmic locomotion. While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29667-youth-lagoon"">Youth Lagoon’</a>s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17672-youth-lagoon-wondrous-bughouse/"">Wondrous Bughouse</a></i> upped the ante for bong-rip phaser effects, Trevor Powers uses them to support and accent luminous and legible mediations on cosmic circumstances; closer “An Orphan of Fortune” wilfully sinks into impenetrable goo. All of this gassy, overproduced stuff should make “Plenty of Girls in the Sea” sound revelatory, but it’s nothing <i>but</i> context, i.e., “see, we could totally write simple pop songs if we wanted to.” But if they think a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZexg8sxyk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bee Gees groove in 6/4 time</a> or an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9dSYgd5Elk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">origin story about doing blow and marrying models</a> were simple pop songs rather than some of the strangest hits of the past decade, we're dealing with resentments too deep-rooted to be fixed over the span of two albums.</p>
<p>Still, it’s easy to root for MGMT. Their <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15885-mgmt"">LateNightTales</a> </i>compilation is fun as hell and their deferential, deflective tone suggests that they envy not only the creative freedom of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips"">Flaming Lips</a>, but also their ability to serve as guides towards the eccentric influences who never shared their commercial luck. And when you see their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52002-watch-mgmt-perform-your-life-is-a-lie-on-letterman/"">Letterman performance of “Your Life Is a Lie”</a>, it feels like the definitive version, as the multimedia format gives MGMT a better ability to convey the mischief and exuberance that their self-titled so badly needs. Because on <i>MGMT</i>, being weird is serious business, their ideas of prog are regressive, their psychedelia draws into its own dark recesses rather than transporting or illuminating, self-indulgence posing as artistic martyrdom. In other words, it’s not MGMT vs. <i>Oracular Spectacular</i>; if anything’s holding MGMT back, it’s themselves.</p></div>"|18487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18487-mgmt-mgmt/|6.2|Ian Cohen

He's always had it, from his beginnings fronting tweelectro-pop band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4436-the-unicorns/"">the Unicorns</a>, through his and drummer Jamie Thompson's second-generation outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2148-islands/"">Islands</a>, and even at points in supergroups (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29216-mister-heavenly/"">Mister Heavenly</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12142-moody-motorcycle/"">Human Highway</a>) and his own solo projects. The songwriter formerly-and-still-sometimes known as Nick Diamonds has demonstrated a singular grasp on inventive songwriting that wriggles its way into gray matter. His twinkling melodies, vivid lyricism, and off-the-wall banter can amplify the rich depth of his influences, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4158-paul-simon/"">Paul Simon</a>'s <i>Graceland</i> and calypso to weird hip-hop and mother nature. But power amounts to little when it's not employed. Which is all to say that when Thorburn tries for something more muted-- as on Islands' fifth LP, <i>Ski Mask</i>-- the result isn't a disaster; his music in this mode can actually be pretty nice, if a little vanilla.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's been a slow process, but over time, Islands have changed considerably. Like a photocopy of a photocopy, the imagination of each album that has followed their explosive 2006 entrance <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4170-return-to-the-sea/""><i>Return to the Sea</i></a><i> </i>has faded, until reaching an end point on 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16287-a-sleep-a-forgetting/""><i>A Sleep and a Forgetting</i></a>. The latter record actually worked in its simplicity, serving as a touching emotional rock bottom from which the band-- or more accurately Thorburn, since who even knows the ever-rotating members of Islands anymore, after Thompson's departure in 2008-- has now rebounded. Thematically <i>Ski Mask</i> is indeed ""angry,"" as Thorburn says in a press release, but it's also desperate, dejected, and occasionally sweet. But the rawness of <i>Forgetting </i>has disappeared again, and the music itself pales in comparison to the blithely complex experimentalism that set the bar high in the first place.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Thorburn's preternatural gift for songwriting keeps <i>Ski Mask</i> from being a <i>bad </i>record. Vaudevillian ditty ""Nil"", sounding like a holdover from his days collaborating with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2938-man-man/"">Man Man</a> frontman Honus Honus in Mister Heavenly, explores self-destruction with an idiosyncratic level of cheese. Clever lines like ""I did a line from a script that I wrote/ I felt the words in the back of my throat"" on ""Death Drive"" and basically all of opening track ""Wave Forms"", when contrasted with the clunkiness of metaphors in ""Becoming the Gunship"", prove Thorburn's knack for memorable wordplay comes and goes these days. Instrumentally, the record is more classically Islands, with a few trademark flares (their calypso xylophone, their cutesy theremin), though several progressions skirt self-plagiarism (the guitar on album closer ""Winged Beat Drums"" sounds like a repurposed demo for <i>Arm's Way</i>'s ""The Arm"" or ""Creeper""). The electro-gallop of ""Sad Middle"" is easily likable and will probably be the best live performance from <i>Mask</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's all pleasant, but when it's over, the only truly memorable song is ""Wave Forms""-- which might have made for a grand exit, had it been placed at the end of the album instead of the beginning. The brilliance of Islands (and the Unicorns, previously) has hinged on Thorburn and Co.'s ability to combine a perfectionist's hunger for innovation with a self-deprecating lightness that flirts with goofiness; <i>Ski Mask</i>, like its most recent, similarly self-serious predecessors, rarely finds either. </p></div>"|18488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18488-islands-ski-mask/|6.4|Devon Maloney

Accordingly, his albums, including his newest effort <i>Drown Out, </i>can seem like they have multiple personalities, jam-packed with ideas that don’t necessarily jive. <i>Drown Out</i> is Daedelus’s first record for Anticon-- he hops from label to label as easily as he hops concepts-- but rather than displaying any artistic growth, he seems to be settling back into his old ways<i>.</i></p>
<p>That’s not to say that the moods he does settle on, however briefly, aren’t lovely. The back-to-back punch of “Tiptoes,” and “Frisson,” sets the listener up to think he’s in for a certain kind of experience: one in which heavy, head-nodding beats eventually give way to an elevation of angelic treble during songs’ climax. The standout “Tiptoes”-- with its unabashedly operatic sample-- is one of the prettiest beats I’ve heard all year. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the curtain drops on that mood  as “Perpetually"", which sounds like a combination of EDM and Motown, takes the stage. It’s not a bad track, but it’s jolting to hear something that has so little in common with what came before it. Then there are the ideas that should never have been indulged. “Keep Still,” makes mincemeat of 2Pac’s “I Get Around.”  The sample simply doesn’t belong in a mess of a song, which, at times, can sound as if it’s parodying the “bleep blorp” sound that people unfamiliar with electronic music use to mock it.</p>
<p>There have been exceptions to Daedelus’ displays of musical ADD. His EP <i>Righteous Fists of Harmony</i> was a smooth, thematically-linked listen.  And <i>Live at Low End Theory</i> showed him in his element-- as a live performer, linked to his the crowd, where spontaneity and improvisation allow a performance to be crafted according to the whims of the listener. In interviews, Daedelus raves about the importance of the live experience, and <i>Drown Out</i> sounds as if it might have been conceptualized as more grist for the live show.</p>
<p>Another pair of linked singles later on <i>Drown Out</i> hints that that’s the case.  “Music Concrete” and “-Ísimo” sound like the A and B side to a traditional dance singles. As that’s the world that Daedelus is most used to, it’s no wonder that he still seems to shudder and shift when confronted with the album format.</p>
<p>Many of Daedelus’ fellows have shown an ability to ditch the dance paradigm and make cohesive albums. But the dapper dandy has always stayed true to his roots-- he simply can’t stay still long enough to put together a collection of complementary songs. <i>Drown Out</i> has plenty of sublime moments, but as each of them has little do with any other it ends up sounding less like an album and more like a grab bag of hurried ideas, the best of which will eventually be experienced somewhere far more immediate.</p></div>"|18490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18490-daedelus-drown-out/|5.7|Jonah Bromwich

The first disc, or tracks 1-15 if you’re listening digitally, compile the <i>Feast</i> side of the equation, while disc two (tracks 16-29) unleash the <i>Beast.</i> If that wasn’t daunting enough, it’s a bunch of <i>remixes</i>. Oh, the remix. What was once the ultimate DJ tool-- dancehall heads gifting a track with a new flavor to hook a new audience or disco producers creating extended edit for the dancefloor-- has become the primary currency of the online music world. For the artist, the right remixer means a leg up; a little visibility in a suffocatingly crowded scene. For the website, they provide <i>content</i>. Finally, for the remixer, they are an essential source of income: more reliable than record sales and less overheads than a tour. Clark’s label-mate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a> called it in typically two-fingers fashion in 2003 with his own remix compilation: <i>26 Mixes For Cash</i>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Nothing wrong with that, obviously. People gotta eat. But for all these reasons, remixes-- music as service, as transaction-- often fall through the cracks. It’s not that they can seem half-hearted or sound half-finished (they can) but that <i>original</i> holds so much more weight in a realm obsessed with the <i>real</i>. Which means, more often than not, remixes are here today, gone tomorrow. The internet’s equivalent of lost change down the back of the sofa. But you would hope if you paused to gather them together their value and artistry would become clear. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Happily, that is absolutely the case with Clark’s <i>Feast / Beast, </i>which provides an illuminating opportunity to listen through Clark’s ears; to hear how he hears music. There are patterns and threads to follow that outline the shape of the artist: a passion for percussive grit, a gift for surprise transitions and, underneath it all, that brilliant creeping wit.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Texturally, Clark is all about contrast. That was made clear from day one with his 2001 debut <i>Clarence Park</i>, which veered from glitched out acid to ambient piano loops. On <i>Feast / Beast</i>, his love of contrast manifests in gritty percussion and grimy melodies. His Amon Tobin remix is at once beguiling airy and thick with the scent of wet soil, while he takes Nathan Fake for a clip-clopping ride into satisfyingly spooked out territory. There’s a calamitously carnal re-imagining of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5523-health/"" target=""_blank"">HEALTH</a>’s “Die Slow”, with its wild-eyed and slippery instrumentation. Then on his remix of his own track “Alice”, the chimes shine through the grey goo like midnight eyes catching the light. But it is the crunchy footfall of his Rone remix that catches the most. It’s thrilling to hear him work with a hip-hop vocal-- it's a highlight in an exceptional collection-- for there feels an instinctual, almost sensual, understanding of the form’s flow and drama.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Drama could be Clark’s middle name because he loves a surprise transition. His version of Kuedo's “Glow” splits in two like a cleaved piece of fruit: one half purring in an ambient loop, the other sounding a battle cry. There’s the grinding poetry of his Nils Frahm remix, with its organ ploughing through a sea of static, and then-- out of nowhere in the final minute-- a tribal rhythm collapses in on itself like accumulated feedback. His rework of Letherette’s “D&amp;T” takes curves like a racing driver, swerving from sparse digital funk to acid-laced techno, while his take on Aufgang’s  “Dulceria” bumbles along in a bleepily hypnotic fashion until the final third when it melts into fizzy-edged sunrise ambience. Then, in scene-stealing style, he sweeps in with an entirely new track-- “Suns Of Temper (Bear Paw Kicks Version)”-- that starts as the kind of electronic funk that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2475-jamie-lidell/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie Liddell</a> should be biting before segueing with typical sleight of hand into an epic orchestral techno number.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While liquid emotion is at the heart of what Clark does-- something highlighted by how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"" target=""_blank"">Bibio</a> sees him on “Absence”, one of the handful of remixes contributed by other artists-- <i>Feast / Beast</i> also bubbles and burns with his sharp humour. His Drvg Cvltvre remix is unreservedly “screw you” in its bombastic barraging, and there’s a playfulness to his pairing of Dave Gahan’s vocal sighs with an elastic acid line on his version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a>’s “Freestate”. Best of all, though, is his cheeky intro to his remix of Milanese’s “Mr Bad News”: “Christopher, somebody's on the telephone for you.” “Oh for fuck’s sake. I’m trying to write this fucking tune, man.” </p></div>"|18485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18485-clark-feast-beast/|7.6|Ruth Saxelby

Visit the indie pop collective's <a href=""http://www.laketheband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, and you'll be greeted by this statement of purpose: ""We play music together, record albums together, plays shows together, and eat snacks together."" It sounds like a pretty decent gig, and LAKE try and make the most of it, as <i>The World Is Real</i> is the band's second full-length offering in 2013 (<i>Circular Doorway</i> was released on their <a href=""http://laketheband.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp page</a> in July), their fourth for K Records, and their seventh overall since 2006. So, needless to say, LAKE like to keep busy, though you'd hardly suspect it after picking up one of their records. Instead, their sincere, polite, plucky music feels as all-natural as their naturalist worldview, with friends like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2930-r-stevie-moore/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">R. Stevie Moore</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/388-karl-blau/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Karl Blau</a> occasionally stopping by to jam, maybe even to share a snack or two. And while <i>Circular Doorway</i> was a more groove-focused-- an adult contempto take on chilled-out 70s AM make-out tunes-- <i>The World Is Real</i> is the sound of LAKE getting back to work, offering 11 new twee-ish, vaguely funky songs that are all very much in line with the ones they've been quietly whipping up for the better part of a decade.</p>
<p>There's something oxymoronic about LAKE's compulsive output: One LAKE album is really all you're ever going to need. The stakes for a band like this are pretty low, so it's important to try and focus on the small details that set <i>The World Is Real</i> apart or, at very least, how the songs stack up against the rest of the catalog. And for the most part, they stack up fine: While <i>Circular Doorway</i> earned itself some homey warmth from its modest production,<i> The World Is Real</i> is the most hi-fi thing the group's ever done. It's unlikely this is a calculated move to reach different sets of ears (or simply more of them), but rather one that made sense at the time given the added emphasis on vocal melodies, gummy bass lines, and varied instrumentation. Though certainly a more confident release, <i>The World Is Real</i> could be perceived as the work of band going through the motions. More likely, though, it's just the latest entry from one that is so comfortable and pleased with their sound, there's never been any real incentive to change much of anything. And yet, that doesn't answer the question of how much you're really going to need it.</p>
<p>LAKE have never had trouble being charming. Though it's not a ringing endorsement, <i>The World Is Real</i> sounds good while it's on-- good for having a drink in an Adirondack chair, good for barefooted Sundays spent padding around the apartment, especially good for riding bikes to. But LAKE do have trouble writing memorable songs, which continues to be a problem here. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11413-madagascar/"" target=""_blank"">""Madagascar""</a>, from their breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13613-lets-build-a-roof/"" target=""_blank""><i>Let's Build a Roof</i></a>, has always felt like an example of a successful LAKE track (thanks to its welcome ability to worm itself into your head), so it's nice to see them juicing it up a little with ""Takin' My Time"", an effective, albeit cheesy marriage of quaint R&amp;B and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Fleetwood</a>-y warmth. ""Composure"" is more balanced, with its paisley patterns and tasteful horns cleverly juxtaposed against Ashley Eriksson's flat admissions of being selfish and conceited and a little dead inside.</p>
<p>Everything else is, well, <i>nice</i>. The fact that it's difficult to find a better adjective to describe <i>The World Is Real</i> is part of LAKE's gift and curse. There's a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Beach Boys</a> here, some chamber pop there, but not a lot of it makes much of an impact, as tempos rarely inch above a sway, and things remain generally light and ephemeral and pleasant. At times it feels like <i>The World Is Real</i> would make for a very excellent children's album; others, you can't get but picture them as a cruise ship band with a lot of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3941-steely-dan/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Steely Dan</a> covers under their belt. The Dan is even quoted here on ""Perfect Fit"" (which borrows from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArQtVcM7w5Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Peg""</a>) as well as ""Dog In the Desert"" (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCtSa0exAH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black Cow""</a>), the former being too peppy, the latter too long and too drowsy. For people looking for fleeting but good-natured vibes, few of these criticisms are going to act as much of a deterrant. For a band like LAKE, making music seems like part of a daily routine. Certainly some days are better than others, but there's always tomorrow.</p></div>"|18486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18486-lake-the-world-is-real/|6.2|Zach Kelly

Soon after, Factory Floor collaborated with Chris &amp; Cosey, the Pop Group’s Mark Stewart, and former New York downtown disco composer Peter Gordon, showing that the new band was well aware of its sonic forebears. Their sinewy self-titled debut for DFA now orients Factory Floor along an axis of artists that embrace industrial, post-punk, disco, acid, avant-garde minimalism, electro, dub and-- most crucially-- the dancefloor, without being beholden to any one genre.</p>
<p>It speaks to the trio’s acumen that, for all of the above musical signifiers, their album never feels overstuffed. They’ve peeled back the industrial drones that informed their earliest releases so as to get at the throbbing heart underneath. It’s evident from the start as “Turn It Up” starts as a 164 BPM tock before quickly paring down to a sensible 124 BPMs: With just a nerve-jangling synth line and handful of percussive events-- including a hi-hat that sounds as if the band whetted it down to a razor’s edge-- Void’s processed voice slithers between the masculine and feminine, and there’s enough frigid, metallic-tinged negative space to suggest a meat locker. </p>
<p>“Here Again” is similarly spartan: an ascending arpeggio, a twitch of a beat, a mix of sequencer and Gurnsey’s beat at its most mechanistic, Void’s “ooohs” dubbed to the point of turning to steam. The trio constantly ratchet up the pressure until the song’s midway point, wherein the tension finally breaks and Void’s line can finally be heard. It’s one of the few moments on the album where such anxiety actually gives way to release.</p>
<p>The album’s highlight is the seven-minute “Fall Back”. “Did it feel like you were going to fall on the ground?”, Void asks in a detached tone that falls between Throbbing Gristle’s “Hamburger Lady” and an alien abduction interrogation. The menace grows from there. When Factory Floor are in this mode, DFA’s influence is most clearly felt; it’s a perfect amalgam of programmed acid lines that seem about to ooze blood and live drums that mimic a man-machine, a hybrid sound of flesh and circuitry that underpinned the label’s most crucial singles. It’s certainly the most <i>visceral</i> music the label has released since the earliest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2244-the-juan-maclean/"" target=""_blank"">Juan Maclean</a> sides (and it’s the eeriest outside of the Invisible Conga People single).</p>
<p>The album’s lone drawback is that, for much of the disc’s 53 minutes, there are barely varying degrees of pressurization. The pacing falls somewhere between the dread of Walter White walking down his gasoline-soaked hallway on ""Breaking Bad"" versus the dread of walking the zombie-filled prison corridors of ""The Walking Dead"". The three minute-long interludes sprinkled throughout do little to leaven the situation. It’s exhausting, to where by album’s end, I’d be hard-pressed to differentiate between “Work Out” and “Breathe In”, even though both are bracing and thrilling as isolated tracks. But in a year where the likes of Kanye and Trent Reznor have reached deep into the dark circuitry of the Wax Trax back catalog to revive the corpse of industrial music, Factory Floor’s relentlessness suits the present moment.</p></div>"|18477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18477-factory-floor-factory-floor/|8.2|Andy Beta

The band who once <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13339-ayrton-senna-ep/"" target=""_blank"">named an EP after a legendary race car driver</a> has chosen to name their third album after a Basque word for ""froth,"" sending thousands of music journalists scrambling to find a synonym for ""froth."" (Recommended: ""spindrift."") After three years of touring on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14147-subiza/"" target=""_blank""><i>Subiza</i></a>'s resplendent builds and easy choruses, the band returned to Barcelona and built a studio for themselves. Terms like ""analog production"" have been tossed around, and the band has replaced their feel-good sampledelia with Actual Female Vocalists, including contributions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"" target=""_blank"">Chairlift</a>'s Caroline Polachek and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27809-glasser/"" target=""_blank"">Glasser</a>. Singer Ekhi Lopetegi is coming off a turbulent breakup and is studying for his doctorate in philosophy. ""It was a really normal life,"" Lopetegi said of Apar's recording process.</p>
<p>Some restraint was probably in order. <i>Subiza</i>'s anthems found the band exploring the limits of their manufactured expanse. There was a thinness to their sound, like a strong gust could tear it apart. <i>Apar</i> takes pains to correct this. The tracks are sturdier and more patient. Lopetegi's delivery, no longer caked in reverb, is noticeably more confident and refined. On songs like ""Destitute Time"" he picks his spots, emphasizing lyrics that, while still difficult to parse, seem to be traversing topics broader than general good vibes. His role on <i>Subiza</i> was as a glorified hypeman for the band's twinkling rush; on <i>Apar</i> he's more akin to a traditional rock frontman, which moves the band still further away from the club music that underpinned <i>Subiza</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The band does find some new avenues to explore. ""Unhold"", which features Polachek as lead vocalist, is a bold pop song that sounds like someone blowing the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins</a> up to billboard size. ""Destitute Time"" is a graceful rock song that accelerates through its chorus and requires no arms-in-the-air bridge to amplify its coda. Similarly, ""You Know It's Right"" generates most of its speed with simple guitar arpeggios and suggests Delorean might be capable of indie rock as sweet, simple, and confident as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a>'s ""Run 2"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If all of this-- strong frontman, collaborators, fewer samples-- sounds like <i>Apar</i> is more the product of a ""real band,"" that's true and it's a double-edged sword. Even if you think that samples and piano riffs are cheap thrills, they're thrills nonetheless, and there are times during <i>Apar</i> that the group struggles to replace them. Late-album tracks like ""Walk High"" and ""Your Face"" are well constructed and tuneful, but their pedestrian arrangements don't nod heads like <i>Subiza</i>'s hammy piano riffs. They, are, in other words, pretty tracks that don't require dance music's repetition or excess. And even given their more refined approach and darkened mood-- that breakup, plus Spain's destitute financial situation-- the band still sounds capable of projecting only blissed-out warmth. If Lopetegi's reedy voice was <i>Subiza</i>'s limiting factor, the band's unchanging timbre may be <i>Apar</i>'s.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So <i>Apar</i> is a modest change in direction, moving the band back towards their roots as indie rockers but retaining the lilt and grandness they developed on <i>Ayrton Senna</i> and <i>Subiza</i>. <i>Apar</i> finds both Lopetegi and his bandmates learning to finesse their songs, to put a little touch on their big, arcing pop. It falls flat sometimes, but it offers hope that there's more to Delorean's world than bigness, that those vast expanses they convey so easily won't become, paradoxically, a constraint. A broader palate is still under development, but <i>Apar</i> provides a path forward without forfeiting Delorean's effortless energy.</span></p></div>"|18468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18468-delorean-apar/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

The next, she's planning to pull out your teeth, gouge out your eyes with a razorblade, and bash in your fucking skull. Clearly, McArdle isn't fucking around; neither, it seems, are Joanna Gruesome. (I'm told they met in anger management, a story almost too good to be true.) The regrettably named Welsh fivesome's debut LP, <i>Weird Sister</i>, crams an awful lot into a little under half an hour: hardcore blastbeats, fuzzed-out twee, violent urges, zombies and pentagrams. <i>Weird Sister</i> is one of the most purely exuberant, hook-stuffed indie-pop records you're likely to hear this year. But it is not afraid of you, and it will beat your ass.</p>
<p>Produced by MJ of up-and-coming UK psychsters Hookworms, <i>Weird Sister</i> is largely comprised of new versions of nascent Gruesome singles. In a show of unity, the band-- McArdle included-- have each adopted the Gruesome surname, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"" target=""_blank"">Ramones</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5337-los-campesinos/"" target=""_blank"">Campesinos!</a> style. Drummer Dave Gruesome, a hardcore kid born decades too late, plays like somebody's lit the end of his sticks on fire. Name change notwithstanding, guitarists George and Owen Gruesome seem separated at birth, their twin assault forking only to give Owen-- who occasionally joins McArdle on vocals-- a half-second to catch his breath. Yet, for all their frantic fuzzbombing, Joanna Gruesome don't skimp on melody. Verses slam into bridges before crashing headlong into choruses, a carefully considered cacophony that'd be almost as striking played at half-speed. By the time one of these hooks have lodged their way into your skull, it seems three equally worthy candidates have already zipped by.</p>
<p>At the center of the fracas is McArdle. She stomps, screams, and shouts her way through plenty of <i>Weird Sister</i>, as though, if she didn't open her mouth, these songs would come bursting forth from her chest just the same. Yet she delivers nearly as much of this tough talk in a sweet, essentially affectless tone, dispassionately hinting at a looming explosion before doing exactly that. These tectonic shifts between ferocity and something approaching tenderness are matched note-for-note by the Gruesomes, who'll follow up a spindly, soft-focus verse with a sudden burst of noise, lending <i>Weird Sister</i> an unpredictability it never seems to shed. This volatility's key to <i>Weird Sister</i>'s liveliness; you could listen to this album a couple dozen times and still not be able to quite see what's around the corner. Could be another Dave Gruesome anti-solo; could be Alanna, brandishing a knife.</p>
<p><i>Weird Sister</i>'s frenzied tone sometimes causes leads to a bit of motion blur; there's not a bad song in the bunch, but when everything's this revved-up and scuzzed-out and just plain exhilarating, slowing your mind down long enough to pick out a highlight seems a thankless task. Still, ""Mickey""-style chanter ""Secret Surprise"" may be the best of the bunch, tumbling from its punchy verse into an especially sweet, soft-focus chorus, throwing a little whizz-bang guitar onto the pile, then toppling over. ""Lemonade Grrrl"" starts out almost bashful; by the end of Dave Gruesome's drum interlude, that placidity's a pile of broken glass. Shouter ""Graveyard"" moves from an echoey Edge-style guitar intro to a Thurston-worthy squeal before dipping into a regal chorus not far from UK twee-poppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28156-veronica-falls/"" target=""_blank"">Veronica Falls</a>. But you don't listen to <i>Weird Sister</i> for the individual moments so much as the push-and-pull between them. Joanna Gruesome's forever pulling you close, asking for your ear, then screaming bloody murder into it.</p>
<p>McArdle sings with more impact than precision, and her band's distortion-slathered music frequently matches her powerhouse voice fervor-for-fervor. That means, as often as not, picking up on every last shout becomes a somewhat flummoxing task. (McArdle was kind enough to type up the lyrics and send them my way, but even her version came with a couple conspicuous blank spots and one instance of ""nonsense noises."") Still, compared to yet another reverb-dunked mumbler who isn't even trying to say much of anything, I'll take the gale force McArdle every time. And even when her words get lost in the fray, the Gruesomes are there to punctuate each sentence. Besides, the well-past-promising <i>Weird Sister</i>-- a deeply passionate, impossibly noisy twee record-- just feels like the sort of thing you spend months and years with, not days and weeks, poring over every little detail, memorizing each scrappy hook. That might just be the weirdest thing about <i>Weird Sister</i>: you think it's going for your throat, then it gets you right in the chest.</p></div>"|18478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18478-joanna-gruesome-weird-sister/|7.4|Paul Thompson

There’s nothing to see here. Since most of you stuck around, let’s consider <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31541-balance-and-composure/"">Balance &amp; Composure</a>’s second LP <i>The Things We Think We’re Missing</i>. The Doylestown, Penn., quintet have made an unapologetically old-school alt-rock album of jet-engine guitars, impotent rat-in-a-cage rage, and searing, soaring vocals-- it isn’t <i>about</i> teen angst, it just sounds like it. As such, this record looks to fill a void for people seeking popular rock music more stylish and emotive than, say, Avenged Sevenfold, but aren’t really in a position to opt out into <i>counterculture</i>. In other words, it’s “alternative rock” in exact terms and nothing about this will make you feel cool or more connected to the zeitgeist. It’s even better if you don’t care about that shit at all, so the only question is, are Balance &amp; Composure good at what they do?</p>
<p>On lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15753-balance-and-composure-reflection"">“Reflection”</a>, the answer is tacitly an emphatic <i>fuck yeah,</i> though I don’t sense that emphatic positivity is something it would cop to. But as a genre piece, it’s damn near perfect. Upon hearing it, a colleague of mine with more refined tastes said, “I’ve never felt that way in my entire life.” It’s a testament to “Reflection” when <i>that way</i> can be identified so quickly. There’s no conflict here, just pubescent confusion of encountering growth and emotions you don’t have the ability to process. A gorgeous lead riff from Andrew Slaymaker (real name, no gimmicks) introduces “Reflection” and is bodyslammed into altered shapes by two pounding chords. Meanwhile, Jon Simmons’ despondent vocals are softened with slightly flat harmonies-- he can’t decide whether to be feared or to be loved or whether he’s just in fear of being loved. A drum roll leads to what sounds like what <i>should </i>be a chorus of epic emotional venting, yet the band effectively renders the straightjacket of one’s self by thrashing in place. As far as the lyrics go, they’re filled with self-loathing, envy, judgment, anger, fear, pretty much everything that registers as a character defect to an adult. And yet “Reflection” reminds you of how those qualities can feel like survival skills at an age when every social setting feels like a warzone.</p>
<p>It’s a powerful formula and one B&amp;C wisely try to replicate throughout <i>The Things We Think We’re Missing</i>. There’s a strange quirk where it sounds like the band is trying out new guises in two-song chunks: during the opening duo of “Parachutes” and “Lost Your Name”, B&amp;C are a plutonium-powered emo band relying more on force than finesse, on slowly cresting melodies and sustained vocal howls rather than sharp hooks. They’re inversions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3986-sunny-day-real-estate"">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>’s “Circles”, forgoing grunge dynamics entirely by lunging out of your speakers and using the chorus as respite before another tidal push. They provide an easy segue into the more traditionally structured, car-friendly hooks of “Back of Your Head” and “Tiny Raindrop” and as <i>Things</i> progresses, B&amp;C have subtly involved into a band that learned enough from their heroes to troubleshoot some of their mistakes. “When I Come Undone” asks what if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure"">the Cure’</a>s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1693-the-cure/"">Ross Robinson-produced album</a> wasn’t some kind of forced primal scream therapy? What if Billy Corgan realized that he could rock a trenchcoat, pancake makeup, and a Stratocaster at the same time during his goth phase? Enjoy “I’m Swimming” and forget <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4929-silversun-pickups"">Silversun Pickups</a> ever existed.</p>
<p>That said, <i>The Things We Think We’re Missing</i> is overwhelming four minutes at a time, galvanizing in 10 minute spans, and utterly exhausting taken as a whole. There are cracks in the brick wall of radio-adjusted compression-- hints of acoustic jangle peek through the stormy romanticism of “Tiny Raindrop”, “Ella” and “Cut Me Open” incorporate reverberating drone, and while the acoustic solo performance of “Dirty Head” works against just about every single strength of B&amp;C, it’s probably what they meant when acknowledging the influence of Neutral Milk Hotel. Problem is they’re all mastered at the same extremely loud volume, negating the idea that <i>Things</i> is a record meant to be listened to sequentially rather than strip-mined for singles.</p>
<p>Simmons encounters similar issues with flexibility and nuance as a vocalist. When he’s going full blast, his tone articulates more than his actual words and standard issue angst (“I need a spark to light this house so dark and deep”) detonates into nuclear catharsis. When he tones down his delivery, a bratty, nasal edge puts an unfortunate spotlight on lyrics that draw from the usual sources for sensitive dude poetry-- Morrissey’s auto eroticism (the night drive fantasies of “When I Come Undone” and “Tiny Raindrop”), Microsoft Word thesaurus (“I need you on my garments/ come at me horrid eyes that seep into my system”) and Robert Smith’s playful surrealism, only without the playful part. The most wincing lyric here (“I’m the spider in your room/ and I got eight eyes all on you”) is taken from a song whose title projects the emotional tenor of the entire record: “Notice Me”.</p>
<p>It’s understandable, since B&amp;C <i>are</i> in a position where they do have to beg for recognition. <i>The Things We Think We’re Missing</i> is a strong alt-rock album when such a thing is about the least fashionable thing imaginable, and its practitioners and fans are largely ignored-- their sonic ideals about punk and indie are sourced from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>, but at a time when the platinum polish of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15854-nevermind-20th-anniversary-edition""><i>Nevermind</i></a> has become weirdly undervalued compared to the more ethically admirable <i>In Utero</i>. It carries on the tradition of alt-rock records that were crucial entry points for young listeners while being scoffed at by their older siblings: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition""><i>Siamese Dream</i></a>, the Cure albums that got MTV airplay, Foo Fighters’ <i>The Colour &amp; The Shape</i>. Not to mention their modern analogues, Deftones’ <i>White Pony</i>, Brand New’s <i>The Devil and God Are Raging Inside of Me,</i> Thursday’s <i>A City By The Light Divided</i>, artful and ambitious heavy pop-rock albums that respectively transcended three genres that triangulate B&amp;C’s coordinates (nu-metal, pop-punk, emo and/or screamo) and were still treated with hostility if not ignored entirely by ostensibly open-minded indie rock fans based on prior reputation. B&amp;C aren’t at that level, but considering the leap they’ve made from their pedestrian debut <i>Separation</i>, <i>The Things We Think We’re Missing</i> serves notice that we shouldn't be surprised if they get there.</p></div>"|18388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18388-balance-and-composure-the-things-we-think-are-missing/|6.6|Ian Cohen

They played the Bruise Cruise, released a 7"" via Scion A/V, put out records that sounded influenced by Johnny Thunders, and made a hard-to-watch <a href=""http://vimeo.com/30776899"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video for ""Glazin'"" starring lip syncing vaginas</a>. Their reputation to date comes from their rock'n'roll nuggets and solid live shows, and for <i>Jacuzzi Boys</i>, they pretty much threw all of that out the window. ""On this record, we totally said, 'Fuck it,'"" Gabriel Alcala <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/jacuzzi-boys-new-album-summer-2013-in-the-studio/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told SPIN</a>. They holed up at the Key Club in the Lake Michigan coast town Benton Harbor, where they worked with in-house production/engineering team Bill Skibbe and Jessica Ruffins to add a smooth <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15775-jacuzzi-boys-glazin/"">glaze</a> over their <a href=""http://blog.urbanoutfitters.com/features/iggy_pop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iggy Pop-cosigned</a> rock'n'roll spirit.</p>
<p>On paper, it's a potentially good move for this band to head in new directions. On <i>Glazin'</i>, as Paul Thompson noted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15775-jacuzzi-boys-glazin/"">in his review</a>, the band struggled to maintain a cohesive sound. Besides, it's become a fairly common practice in the garage world lately for artists to jump ship and explore new sonic territory. Hunx and His Punx recently went <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18286-hunx-and-his-punx-street-punk/"">more cartoonishly aggro</a> with awesome results. Harlem's Michael Coomers traded out his old band's volume for a more subdued (and very good) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17143-the-garden-of-joy-and-the-well-of-loneliness/"">record as Lace Curtains</a>. Mike Donovan has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15805-mike-donovan-new-fieldhand-bop/"">gone acoustic</a>, and Ty Segall is constantly moving in different directions. On their new album, the Jacuzzis haven't gotten quiet like Ty did on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18398-ty-segall-sleeper/""><i>Sleeper</i></a>. They've started experimenting with the texture of their guitar sound, and they've started writing tracks that are, at times, spacier and more slick. </p>
<p>More than once, the songs of <i>Jacuzzi Boys</i> recall the Smith Westerns circa <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15016-dye-it-blonde/"">Dye It Blonde</a></i>, and sometimes, they can wear that sound well and gain some catchy, immediate footing. ""Dust"" is an easy highlight, with a breezy opening guitar solo and some twinkling, twee percussive accents. They're at their best when they throw muscle behind their songs-- the vocals on ""Hotline"" seethe while the bassline drones and surges. Every now and then, Alcala breaks through the track's continuous drive with a loud, two-strum guitar stab and some spat-out consonants (""TUH""). That song's also an example of them implementing some spacier sounds with satisfying results. It's a similar deal on ""Rubble"", a ripper with some toy raygun synths and a meaty guitar sound.</p>
<p>The rest of the songs pose an obstacle, as the band start presenting new idea after new idea. ""Guillotine"" has a dub psych groove that repeats for a nearly unvarying four minutes. ""Ultraglide"" is the jangling and mellow album closer, which is pleasant enough, but once again overstays its welcome. The intro of ""Over the Zoom"" recalls the pulsing intro of Tame Impala's ""Elephant"", but without that song's bassline grooves or sonic dexterity. Ultimately, it's an album packed with monotony. Though they occasionally break through that pattern with a guitar solo or burst of intensity, for the most part, the songs just sit there, following the same tropes until they're over.</p>
<p><i>Jacuzzi Boys</i> is a collection of well-recorded, well-constructed, boring songs. By throwing everything out the window and going for a new sound, they've made a record that feels anonymous. The stuttering ""t-t-t-t-t-take it apart"" chorus on ""Double Vision"" is the sort of rigid, slick, uncatchy material that sounds like it could've been churned out by a lower tier new wave band searching for radio play. The production's great; the songs are problematic. They're forgettable, and they don't wear well on repeat listens. The supporting players that are often discussed alongside this band-- their Hardly Art labelmates, artists they've shared bills and labels with, Iggy Pop-- are generally wild, attention-grabbing characters. The glossy, faceless songs on this record have muddied any definable personality the Jacuzzi Boys once had.</p></div>"|18552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18552-jacuzzi-boys-jacuzzi-boys/|5.9|Evan Minsker

It’s a strategy that pays off as often as it turns out distracting: they’ve struck gold (the sensual disco of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3506-supernature/"" target=""_blank""><i>Supernature</i></a>), they’ve fallen flat (2008’s snoozeworthy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11128-seventh-tree/"" target=""_blank""><i>Seventh Tree</i></a>), and they’ve stumbled admirably (the uneven 80s pastiche of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14063-head-first/"" target=""_blank""><i>Head First</i></a>). But on <i>Tales of Us</i>, their sixth album, they return to the sound of the album that originally made them famous, 2000’s fantastically witchy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3504-felt-mountain/"" target=""_blank""><i>Felt Mountain</i></a>. Touching on that record’s folkier side and running with it, the new record is a delicate affair every bit as fragile as the romantic themes it obsesses over. And while it’s not a full back-to-2000 affair, some of the duo’s unique imagination is replaced with a traditionalism that feels incongruous with the rest of their career.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Tales of Us, </i>two years in gestation, was recorded in the English countryside, and it sounds like it. You can practically hear the fog rolling through the moonlit hills. The album digs deep into an idealized concept of English folk, full of lilting melodies that could have been taken from ancient songs (or just a Renaissance fair) and production so subtle sometimes it feels like there’s nothing beyond acoustic guitar, some strings, and Alison Goldfrapp’s typically haunting vocals. When that formula works, it’s uncommonly haunting-- second single “Annabel” has an icy mist hanging over it, and Goldfrapp proves more than effective in one of the more arresting moments on the album.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Her voice is more affected than it’s ever been on <i>Tales of Us</i>; she’s dead serious all the time. The sexuality of “Strict Machine” and the sly humour of “Rocket” are gone, and instead she intones with a cold and artificial mannerism, like she’s reading off a book of old plays. That mood isn’t lifted by the lyrics. Every song refers to a different character in some imagined universe, but the inherent melodrama is only exacerbated by the dead-serious delivery; it has all the emotional impact of a soap opera.</span></p>
<p>Of course, Goldfrapp have always been a band you could enjoy as much for aesthetics as lyrical content. And <i>Tales of Us </i>is certainly pretty on its own terms, though the songs are bare bones and aren’t placid enough to achieve the attractive wintry drift of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"" target=""_blank"">Grouper</a>. It’s not as if the LP doesn’t have its moments: on “Alvar,” subtle electronics turn the chorus into a gorgeous smear of melody, and on first single “Drew,” her anxious vocals are riveting, especially against the unsettling backdrop of quick, fingerpicked guitar and sweeping strings. These are glimpses of the typical Goldfrapp genius, but now they’re mere flashes rather than tangible entities.</p>
<p>Admittedly, with a few exceptions, it’s hard to find fault with many of these tracks. A few of them, like “Simone”, are simply unmemorable, but each one has its redeeming qualities. In fact, almost any of these songs would sound beautiful on their own, or make a perfect reflective interlude on any of the band’s previous albums. But presented as a whole, <i>Tales of Us </i>is a dreary blur of folky pretense-- from a group that’s been through so many phases, one that lacks this much imagination is almost unforgivable. Diehard fans of Goldfrapp will no doubt find something to love here, but for the rest of us, it’s a thin record that doesn’t do much to prop up its skeletal frame.</p></div>"|18474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18474-goldfrapp-tales-of-us/|6.1|Andrew Ryce

An army vet drifting from Albuquerque to his grandma's house on Chicago's South Side, Beal released his earliest recordings via CD-R, usually accompanied by hand-drawn zines, left, as he put it to <a href=""http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201203/willis-earl-beal-interview-xl-recordings"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>GQ</i></a>, ""all around the hipster places and the coffee shops""-- places where Beal rightly guessed that people would be drawn to strange, singular art objects that seemed like missives from a subterranean world.</p>
<p>If that all sounds calculating, it's because it was: Like his hero Tom Waits, Beal presented himself as a savant-like character who just crawled out of the swamp but was in reality a savvy performer aware of peoples' longstanding fascination with outlaws, boogeymen, and characters who present themselves as forces of nature rather than products of society. At one point last year, he even told <a href=""http://www.timeoutchicago.com/music-nightlife/music/15238391/willis-earl-beal-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Time Out Chicago</i></a> he wanted to be an outsider artist, somehow forgetting that one of the conditions of being an outsider artist is not knowing you're an outsider artist. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Beal's backstory isn't as relevant to <i>Nobody Knows</i>, which in 2013 arrives more or less like any other album: Recorded in a studio, released by a label (instead of picked up by one retroactively), marketed, hopefully, like the work of another singer-songwriter just elbowing his way through the crowd. The music is more diverse and expansive than it was on <i>Acousmatic Sorcery</i>, which is probably just a function of better resources: Sounds and styles Beal only had the tools to hint at before are rendered professionally and in high definition, and his voice-- a bellowing, conventionally soulful instrument-- is given the sonic space it probably deserves, sitting in the mix like an old iron anchor.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Nobody</i> split their influences between old-fashioned blues and indie ballads, replete with the sounds of glockenspiels and warm, staticky ambience. The modes aren't all that different. Blues ballads, like indie confessionals, can be almost threateningly intimate, like a cage built from the singer's feelings designed to trap and hold a listener in place. Parts of <i>Nobody</i>-- like parts of <i>Acousmatic Sorcery</i>-- imitate nervous breakdowns, sexual frenzy, and other states of uncomfortably heightened awareness, but that's the point: A born seducer, part of Beal's routine is to draw his listeners into dark places, lower his eyes, jingle a set of keys, and grin. </p>
<p>Like Waits, Beal is a mishmash of tropes made from a shared language you know without having to be taught it: he's ""Cool like a fool in the summertime"" on the hymn-like highlight ""Wavering Lines""; he's ""in transition goin' from town to town"" on ""Ain't Got No Love""; he's ""nine hard inches like a pitchfork prong"" on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15779-too-dry-to-cry/"">""Too Dry To Cry""</a>. He's a shadowy figure skulking the streets at night; he's a corner-store preacher on the brink of revelation; he's a little hambone and a little field holler. He's less a blues singer than a blues incarnate-- an artist that will appeal to people more interested in blues as a theatrical concept than a genre of music.  </p>
<p>Which is all to say that despite his apparent idiosyncrasies, Beal is pretty up the middle. Compared to TV on the Radio, Autre Ne Veut, or even Daughn Gibson-- all of whom have experimented with weird, histrionic mutations of the blues-- Beal sounds like a traditionalist more interested in moving ideas around than expanding on them. The real irony of <i>Nobody Knows</i> is that it makes him sound like a more fully realized artist, but a more conservative one, too.</p></div>"|18460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18460-willis-earl-beal-nobody-knows/|7.2|Mike Powell

The black-and-white video showed four telegenic people with perfect haircuts performing near a carefully placed Johnny Cash poster, clearly a month or two away from fulfilling their destiny on the cover of several American magazines.</p>
<p>Except that never happened, and, in fact, it seemed that someone had made a number of mistakes-- the band may have actually once been called Drive Like I Do, or maybe the Big Sleep, and in fact already might not be called the Slowdown anymore. Anyway, they disappeared immediately-- their Soundcloud, their Bandcamp, and even that video came down unceremoniously, all before they had even begun to assume their rightful one-hit wonder status.</p>
<p>A couple years later, we find ourselves facing a complete reboot. Hi, we're <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30622-the-1975/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">the 1975</a>, and this is our brand-new song ""Sex"", this same group of people are now telling us. To which we can only shrug, and say: OK, guys. Emerging from this long, bewildering gestation, they now have the overcompensating brio of a band that is making its first impression for the second time-- their band name, album name, and first song are <i>all</i> ""The 1975."" ""Sex"" has even been completely re-recorded and given a new, fumbling-teenagers-in-lust video treatment.  </p>
<p>They've also retooled their sound. In this incarnation, they have stepped away from third-wave emo and aim for the gleaming, modular synth rock of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13052-wolfgang-amadeus-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window""><i>Wolfgang</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Phoenix</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">M83</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Hurry Up, We're Dreaming!</a>,</i> which ironically makes them less distinctive now than it would have in 2010.

<p>There are still a handful of serviceable pop-rock singles: ""The City,"" built on a big, blocky drum loop, has a bit of the forlorn romanticism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Bloc Party</a> circa ""I Still Remember.""

target=""_blank"">M83</a>'s ""Midnight City."" Matthew Healy's pinched vocals hit that ice-cream-headache sweet spot between pretty-boy quaver and adenoidal yelp, and the version of ""cool"" he seems to be gesturing towards feels endearingly carbon-dated and translated from a few different languages into English. There is a lot of overt leering in their lyrics, but no sex or grease or danger anywhere in the music, even on ""Sex,"" which is here and is still their best song by miles. </p>
<p>The song, along with precious few others on <i>The 1975</i>, boasts a secret weapon sorely missing elsewhere: a middle eight. For such a pop-oriented band, The 1975's songwriting has turned out remarkably stiff, cloistered, and unimaginative. The production, which is glistening and brilliant, usually points to what the band might have accomplished with more sophisticated chops: The skipping synths and handclaps that open ""M.O.N.E.Y."", or the itchy guitar figure fidgeting near a blocky drum beat in ""Talk!"", work up a gently caffeinated fizz. But the songs zip along the tight lines established by their opening seconds and refuse to budge, not a bridge in sight for miles. The fizz fades quickly, and the effect, over the course of the album, is a little like a promising new band introducing and re-re-introducing itself to you. There is some value in figuring out what to say next.</p></div>"|18467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18467-the-1975-the-1975/|5.9|Jayson Greene

While Hamilton may lack the cultural cachet of Canada's largest city, Steeltown served as a creative incubator for singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31482-jessy-lanza/"" target=""_blank"">Jessy Lanza</a>: she fell into a collaborative role with a local acquaintance, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2229-junior-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Junior Boys</a> member Jeremy Greenspan, that led to studio sessions and a deal with the UK electronic label Hyperdub. The result of Lanza and Greenspan's work together is <i>Pull My Hair Back</i>, Lanza's debut collection of glacial electro-R&amp;B.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Pull My Hair Back</i> rings with a level of confidence surprising for a first record: Lanza experiments with bold minimalism, and frequently employs her voice to meet melodic and rhythmic ends in nontraditional ways. Hiccupping lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15669-kathy-lee/"" target=""_blank"">""Kathy Lee""</a> is ultra-stark, with Lanza's breathy vocal backed by little more than tiny percussive shakes and snaps; on ""Fuck Diamond"" she becomes a percussive tool herself, her casual readings of ""Fuck that"" and other wordless bits strung together and made part of a burbling tapestry that's reminiscent of the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a>. Lanza's willingness to play a supporting role on her own songs, and to give those songs room to breathe, suggests an admirable level of restraint and a good ear for the larger sonic picture.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With all that restraint and space, Lanza's showier gestures stand out. There are several such moments on standout track ""5785021,"" including a featherlight, fluttering vocal in the chorus and a beautifully textured, rippling synth that unfolds over the song's back half. The remainder of the album has its share of turns in the spotlight, from a wickedly funky synth drop on the stellar ""Against the Wall"" that's straight out of a 1980s playbook to the thrilling closing section of ""Keep Moving"", surely the album's peak in terms of sonic density.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While Greenspan's production choices and craftsmanship are integral to the album's success, Lanza is more than just a producer's pawn. One of her strengths as a vocalist is her ability to convey personality in small but definite ways, even if it's just through a word or short phrase. When she coos ""You know my address"" on ""5785021,"" it glows with heat and intelligence and control, just enough to paper over the oddity of its existence in a song that's ostensibly about calling someone. It may be a stretch to say Lanza is creating characters within these songs, but she's certainly injecting personality.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's tempting to imagine how these songs would transform if Lanza unleashed the considerable chops that occasionally shine on <i>Pull My Hair Back</i>.

Not that he deserved that kind of fate; in a just world his punchline-barrage insult comedy bars and no-bullshit boom-bap should've introduced at least a couple of his records into the collections of future Scribble Jam battlers. But even on 2001's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4183-pimps-dont-pay-taxes/"" target=""_blank"">Pimps Don't Pay </a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4183-pimps-dont-pay-taxes/"" target=""_blank"">Taxes</a>--</i> the album that broke him through to his cult audience-- he was stressing about illegal downloaders and the prospect of being permanently stuck underground, unable to afford a Caddy with some dice in the mirror. Disillusionment set in by the end of 2008, when the realization finally set in that his DIY-fueled hobby had become a slog of a job. After swapping out his music career to focus more on his writing, his 2011 industry-casualty memoir <i>Root for the Villain </i>and <a href=""http://www.egotripland.com/author/j-zone/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his rap-encyclopedia columns for </a><a href=""http://www.egotripland.com/author/j-zone/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>ego trip</i></a><i> </i>provided a less stressful outlet for his wiseass insight.</p>
<p>And yet here he is again with a new record. It's not a contractual obligation, not something that sounds like he forced himself to make it, not a convenient tie-in to his now two-year-old book. It's him in his home studio putting together vintage-sounding beats and talking that same brand of shit he trafficked in when he did it for the love a dozen years ago. <a href=""http://j-zone.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamping it</a> circumvents the dilemma of having pallets of unwanted copies in some Fat Beats back room waiting to be destroyed. But other than that, he put it all together with the same old fervor-- self-enforcing low-tech limitations on the production process and avoiding anything outside his came-up-in-the-80s wheelhouse. <i>Peter Pan Syndrome </i>is such a focused and niche-satisfying record that it likely wouldn't work worth a damn if J-Zone didn't have his heart in it, but in what appears to be a welcome 180, he goes off and performs like somebody who's never been burned by the business.</p>
<p><i>Peter Pan Syndrome </i>initially seems like a comedic exercise in balancing the crass barb-spitting of his younger self and the aging cynic who sees things changing in ways he doesn't like. His crankiness at the expectations of the dating world is where things get the rawest. “Black Weirdo” hinges on his stated inability to get with the “grown &amp; sexy” thing because he doesn't want a caesar cut and can't stand 90s R&amp;B (aside from Jodeci, Aaron Hall and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"" target=""_blank"">R. Kelly</a> “'cause they some goons”). “Gadget Ho” cusses out women at the club who seem more interested in texting and taking cameraphone photos than listening to his come-ons. And “The Fox Hunt"", a back-and-forth session with Juggaknots member Breeze Brewin, is an exercise in lowered expectations-- going for “ugly chicks” to cut down on relationship drama-- that gets to the old “it's what's inside that counts” truism as irreverently as possible.</p>
<p>If that all sounds immature as hell at best and troublesome at worst, it's also tied in to a bigger theme at the album's real heart. <i>The Peter Pan Syndrome </i>is an examination of the midlife crisis of an artist who realizes he's not cut out for the 9-to-5 life, or much of anything else that the American Dream expects of him. J-Zone's aggravated flow and stand-up-ready delivery lends itself to some sharp observations on class struggle, gentrification, and the travails of thwarted upward mobility. “Trespasser” calls out Midwestern transplants who displace Brooklyn beef patty restaurants and give neighborhoods new euphemistic names to avoid the scary connotations of Bushwick or “Do-or-Die Bed-Stuy,” damning these newcomers not simply because they're quirky hipster cliches but because they're assholes who won't nod to the trash collector or let kids pet their Cosby-sweatered dog. Philly indie luminary Has-Lo joins up on “An Honest Day's Robbery,” where the dead-end lack of job prospects has them resorting to the desperate measure of engineering a “slip and fall” insurance scam at a Whole Foods. And there's an obvious but much-needed observation in “Jackin' for Basquiats” that J-Zone trades with his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3496-quasimoto/"" target=""_blank"">Lord Quas</a>-esque rodent-voice sidekick Chief Chinchilla: How'd rappers turn paintings into status symbols when their $50 million price tags never go back to the cash-strapped arts community?</p>
<p>That feeling of broke-but-fuck-it itchiness, that fine blend of frustration and defiant creation, shines through in J-Zone's production as well. Keeping in mind that a lot of the hip-hop he grew up with and reveres came about through technical limitations, mistakes, and low budgets, he kept his studio Roger Corman thrifty and leaned heavily on equipment that got a bit janky with age and neglect. After being run through an MPC 2000 with ten busted pads and a couple four-tracks, his beats sound 1995 in ways Tumblr rappers born that year have been flailing to reproduce. It's a setup that only getting old and happy with being set in his ways can really justify, but its layered, painstakingly battered into shape compositions never fail to claim that boom-bap revivalist sweet spot, especially with J-Zone's own chopped-up live drumkit breaks as part of the equation. (He even offers a few bars of uninterrupted solo playing for break purposes at the end of “Hog Slop”: “you can sample 'em, just gimme some credit, a'ight?”)</p>
<p>There's approximately zero reason not to get this if you like <i>Pimps Don't Pay Taxes</i>-- it's that same perspective, larger than life without living large, marinated in a dozen years worth of life lessons. There's a dividing line that runs through it where it could be either the triumph of ageless unfiltered spirit, or the kind of extended middle finger to propriety that has you reaching for the word “manchild."" That it exhibits both of these sides and does its damnedest to reconcile them-- from the dirty-joke crash-pad lament “Crib Issues” to the soul-searching monologue of “Rap Baby Boomers”-- makes<i> Peter Pan Syndrome </i>a compelling listen, even through the jokey moments. Sure, J-Zone hasn't changed a lot stylistically since he hit that first peak back in 2001-- but that's kind of the point. And it's a point well made.</p></div>"|18516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18516-j-zone-peter-pan-syndrome/|7.5|Nate Patrin

Their fifth album is called <i>AM</i>, and those mountainous initials stood sky-high behind the band as they preened and stomped like proper rock stars through a<a href=""http://youtu.be/33HyuBLmYgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span class=""s1"">headlining Glastonbury set</span></a> earlier this year. Their face-shrouding hair and brown hoodies are out; greaser streaks and bespoke suits are in. And the same band that once aimed its sights at windbag poseurs on ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" is now based in Los Angeles. These changes have caused some to question Arctic Monkeys' commitment to their initial no-bullshit ideals. But the quartet isn't giving into the mindless grandeur of rock'n'roll as much as they're working within its confines to mine new territory; over the last eight years, as they've gone from spastic punk, to doomed stoner rock, to sparkling guitar pop, to this new album's skinny-jeaned funk, Arctic Monkeys have stayed close to the spirit of their debut's title while minimizing its excess at the same time.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Meanwhile, singer and lyricist Alex Turner has moved from syllable-stuffing chronicles of indie nightlife culture to songs that are sleeker, more blue-black, more self-lacerating. Thematically, <i>AM</i> centerpiece ""No. 1 Party Anthem"" comes off like a seedier take on Arctic Monkeys' breakout track ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"" as it tells of a collar-popped lothario on the prowl in a dank club made up of ""lights on the floors and sweat on the walls, cages and poles."" But instead of blaring, this anthem is wistful, its piano, acoustic strums, and croons suggesting days gone by (along with 70s Elton John and Rod Stewart). Its swirling bridge sums up the scene in just a few choice phrases-- ""The look of love/ The rush of blood/ The 'she’s with me'/ The Gallic shrug""-- and sounds like a definitive endnote to Turner's most notable songwriting style.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So <i>AM</i> goes beyond the sweaty clubs and furtive flirts into the hotel rooms, after parties, and bad decisions that can follow. The crux of the record is neatly summed up by the hook to the blistering ""R U Mine?"": ""R U mine tomorrow, or just mine tonight?""-- an entire world of sex and love and desire distilled to quick-hit text-speak that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> could appreciate. Turner isn't sure of the answer to that question, and the resulting limbo does his head in all over the LP. He's an avowed romantic living in an unromantic world, grasping for meaning in a city-to-city road-dog lifestyle hellbent on repelling it. In some ways, Turner's struggle and his band's recent gleaming transformation into something like rock gods is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a>'s turnaround circa <i>Achtung Baby</i>, when that quartet traded in deep virtuousness for sin, rhythm, and leather jackets. For Arctic Monkeys, loosening the tether to credulity can be freeing, allowing the band to live out their classic-rock dreams: T. Rex bop, Bee Gees backup vocals, Rolling Stones R&amp;B, and Black Sabbath monster riffage are all rendered modern throughout <i>AM</i> with the help of longtime producer James Ford. And for Turner in particular, the switch has him connecting strings of desperate 3 a.m. thoughts: some horny, some bleary, some a bit frightening.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Two of the album's slinkiest and best tracks have Turner sounding slyly wolfish, like a perplexed predator confusing lust and longing. ""I dreamt about you nearly every night this week,"" he purrs on opener ""Do I Wanna Know?"", which slowly rolls forward thanks to guitarist Jamie Cook's lizard-brain riff and drummer Matt Helders' Queen-sized beat; ""Knee Socks"", meanwhile, tells of a wintertime tryst that climaxes with an operatic guest vocal from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"" target=""_blank"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>'s Josh Homme, who could've used some of <i>AM</i>'s groove on this year's lumbering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18087-queens-of-the-stone-age-like-clockwork/"" target=""_blank""><i>… Like Clockwork</i></a>. Whereas 2009's Homme-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13374-humbug/"" target=""_blank""><i>Humbug</i></a> had the Arctic Monkeys trying on QOTSA's heaviness with varied success, <i>AM</i> integrates its influences more fully-- and, at times, even beats Homme at his own snake-rock game.  </p>
<p class=""p2"">The only solace found on this paranoid and haunted album is within its eclectic music, as well as the idea of music itself. ""Mad Sounds"" is <i>AM</i>'s most hopeful song, an achingly sincere ballad that employs melody, swing, and ""oh la la las"" to attest to the power of melody, swing, and ""oh la la las."" It teases out the purest interpretation of the Rorschach-like sine waves that adorn <i>AM</i>'s cover, which-- depending on your vantage, or mood-- could also read as leering sunglasses or maybe a bikini top. Creeping closer ""I Wanna Be Yours"" combines all three meanings while seemingly answering the question posed by opener ""Do I Wanna Know?"" That is: When faced with the choice between easy pleasures and lasting devotion, Turner is picking the latter. Sweet, right? But upon further inspection, it's not so simple. ""I Wanna Be Yours"" features lyrics by UK punk poet John Cooper Clarke from his 1982 track of the same name, which uses the language of commercialism to express the deepest love. ""I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust,"" sings Turner as a lonely drum machine highlights the sentiment's emptiness. Still, the song doesn't sound cynical. It's genuinely affecting. The ultimate message-- will future generations have the capacity to love people as much as their cars, their coffee pots, their phones?-- rings terrifyingly true in our time of personal branding. Arctic Monkeys let these thoughts languish. ""Maybe I just wanna be yours,"" Turner sings. Maybe not.  </p></div>"|18386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18386-arctic-monkeys-am/|8.0|Ryan Dombal

Which isn’t to say that it isn’t still a <i>little</i> lazy, befitting a rapper who seems more interested in his skateboard than in his music. Wayne’s lyrics still consist of packets of plangent nonsense delivered straight off the dome through predictable flows, and he’s mostly freestyling over other peoples’ songs on this tape, not always taking time to remove DJ tags from downloaded instrumentals (“New Slaves”). Even given all that, <i>Dedication 5</i> presents a looser, more relaxed Lil Wayne which, in spots, makes Wayne’s unholy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10229-da-drought-3/"" target=""_blank"">2000s mixtape run</a> seems like less of a distant memory.</p>
<p><i>Dedication 5</i>, it should be noted, comes at a particularly interesting point in Wayne's timeline. Though it's unclear when the collection was recorded, Wayne is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50562-lil-wayne-hospitalized-for-seizure-again/"" target=""_blank"">coming off a major health scare</a> and returning to his best-known mixtape franchise, a series highlighted by the modern rap classic <i>Dedication 2</i>. He's certainly coasted in recent years-- that hasn't cost him his radio ubiquity thanks to songs like ""Love Me"" and ""Rich as Fuck""-- but <i>Dedication 5, </i>on the surface, could be seen as an opportunity to reinvigorate his fanbase's interest. Certainly, it's deeper than recent mixtape one-offs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17159-dedication-4/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dedication 4 </i></a>or stopgaps like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15663-sorry-4-the-wait/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sorry 4 the Wait</i></a>, but <i>D5 </i>still has its fair share of issues.</p>
<p>The tape is long-- 29 songs-- but fortunately highlight “You Song”, which finds Lil Wayne kicking back and letting an eager <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a> steal the track, comes early. (It would have been a highlight on <i>Dedication 2</i>, too). We're well past the point where Young Money marquee signees <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> are obligated to step onto the boss’ mixtape, so the strength of the newcomer’s guest spot suggests that Wayne’s reputation is still sterling in some corners of the industry. Other tracks, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>-featuring opener “I’m Good”, would work well on a retrofitted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15770-tha-carter-iv/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tha Carter IV</i></a>, while echoes of the “Mixtape Weezy” heyday come on the goofy, spoken interludes that punctuate <i>Dedication 5</i>, where Wayne introduces new, unmemorable signees before jumping onto the next instrumental. </p>
<p>It all feels pretty familiar, and those who’ve bothered to tune in to Wayne <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17802-lil-wayne-i-am-not-a-human-being-ii/"" target=""_blank"">during recent years</a> will find plenty to groan over as well. He somehow outdoes himself with his lewd take on “Bugatti”-- don’t think about it, please just don’t think about it-- and often mails it in lyrically (“Had a phone in jail/ That’s a cell phone”). Though he’s still got an ear for the beat and can manipulate his flow to fit-- and, again, most of these bars are rapped without rehearsal, so adjust your mindset accordingly-- <i>Dedication 5</i> is uneven, front-heavy, and too long for one sitting. But with both recent mixtapes as well as recent projects, Wayne has set the bar very low. What more can he say? It’s hard to know until the artist himself decides, but <i>Dedication 5</i>-- a release whose DatPiff page earnestly reads ""Welcome back Mixtape Weezy”-- shows that <i>some</i> gears are still moving.</p></div>"|18561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18561-lil-wayne-dedication-5/|5.1|Corban Goble

Fuzz distortion was suddenly as threatening as the fur on a baby chick, and two lead guitars didn't <i>duel </i>so much as squiggle playfully alongside each other, creating exuberant, but manageable, finger-painted messes. It was a time of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3913-the-spinanes/"" target=""_blank"">the Spinanes</a>, whose drummer Scott Plouf played with a patient, graceful thump that signaled the scene's genial lack of urgency and whose last name was an onomatopoeia for his style: A soft-pedaled plosive, a polite exhalation, a cumulus cloud clearing its throat.</p>
<p>The Brooklyn band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28509-grooms/"" target=""_blank"">Grooms</a> are a floating piece of mid-90s Portland, serenely bobbing in the shoals of the 2010s indie world. This has been their function ever since 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13787-rejoicer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rejoicer</i></a>, an album immune to talking points and sturdily replayable even today. Their third album,<i> Infinity Caller</i>, feels like just as much of a welcome tonic to the squabbling Now conversation as ever, which means they are very, very good at what they do.</p>
<p>Grooms don't just humbly steward indie-rock nostalgia into our laps like pizza-delivery guys, though. The reason their music is comforting is because the band sounds so, well, comfortable: Grooms have been playing together since before they were even Grooms, and went by the name Muggabears. By now their assured interplay is a joy in itself. Their guitars tangle and pull apart like kite strings, and the drums hit with a gentle splash (or maybe a ""plouf"") rather than a crack. From the very first watercolor glimmers of guitar on ""Lion Name"", the bass nudging carefully forward and elbowing lead singer Travis Johnson's <i>Peanuts</i> yelp to the forefront, <i>Infinity Caller</i> announces itself: You can relax, this will be easy on everyone.</p>
<p>This is one of their most fully realized albums, something longtime fans will delight in discovering. Bassist Emily Ambruso's vocal turns (lead on ""Iskra Goodbye,"" prominent backing on ""Sometimes Sometimes"" and many others) have darkened and grown more distinctive and interesting, making her a welcome and equal counterpoint to Johnson. Their songwriting also has developed into something sharper, less atmospheric and blobby. ""Play"" pivots on a pedal tone, allowing it to swing gracefully between major and minor, and ""I Think We're Alone Now"" has one of their stickiest choruses.</p>
<p>It's a minor music-writing cliché to observe that a derivative band ""sound more like themselves"" with each passing release, but if Grooms still don't quite sound like some platonic ur-Grooms, standing on their own and beholden to no one-- or something--  they do sound like a more fully realized and sharply etched iteration of the indie-rock they clearly love. Their lyric and song titles stir echoes in a way that feels intentional and even playful -- they have a song called ""Something I Learned Today"" in addition to the one called ""I Think We're Alone Now"", and on ""Completely"", Johnson sings ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRg6-yOjo4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I never was the name of the pacifist one</a>"" with a cadence and phrasing that brings the non-sequitur reference ""Ballroom Blitz"" to mind. They know they remind you of that band, whatever that band is, and have some sly fun confusing your memories of exactly which band it is.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, the lyric quoted above might be inaccurate. I didn't even check with the publicist. It might be ""blasphemous one,"" or even ""pessimist one."" But the truth is that it doesn't quite matter; the song nudges Johnson's voice down the same lazy river of guitars. It's hard to get worked up about specifics when in a reclining position, and <i>Infinity Caller</i> invites you to grab a Koozie and float on.  </p></div>"|18507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18507-grooms-infinity-caller/|7.0|Jayson Greene

That 1995 album-- on which the pioneering Liverpool band broke definitively with their grindcore roots, opting for a groovier, more hard-rock-oriented sound-- had its moments, but in retrospect, it plays like a period curiosity rather than a worthy cap to one of extreme metal's most impressive evolutions. The band members seem to agree. As guitarist Bill Steer <a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/featured/interview-bill-steer-of-carcass/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> <i>Decibel</i> recently, ""To me, it's really evident when you listen to <i>Swansong</i> that it's a band on the decline.""</p>
<p>Carcass haven't explicitly framed <i>Surgical Steel</i>, their new comeback LP, as a gesture of atonement, but all signs suggest that they're engaging in some savvy revisionist history. Instead of picking up where <i>Swansong</i> left off, this record rewinds the tape further. <i>Surgical Steel</i> reconciles choice elements from the band's early classics-- records like 1989's <i>Symphonies of Sickness</i> and 1991's <i>Necroticism: Descanting the Insalubrious</i>, which married grindcore's primitive blurt to gross-out lyrical tongue-twisters and a refreshingly progressive compositional sense-- with their mid-period masterpiece, <i>Heartwork</i>, perhaps the greatest example to date of an extreme-metal band nodding to the polish and swagger of above-ground rock while retaining their core ferocity.</p>
<p><i>Surgical Steel</i> is a nostalgic statement, seemingly designed to trigger a Pavlovian response in fans. Not only does the album mark the return of the machine-gun tempos that were absent from <i>Swansong</i> and the animalistic back-up growls, jettisoned on <i>Heartwork</i>, of Steer and original drummer Ken Owen (who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 and doesn't appear behind the kit here); it also features a pulse-quickening instrumental intro, ""1985,"" on which Steer expands a fragment from a vintage rehearsal tape into a triumphant multitracked overture. <i>Surgical Steel</i>'s immaculate production values are familiar too; the band worked here with Colin Richardson, who helmed every Carcass record from <i>Symphonies</i> through <i>Swansong</i>. Even the album art is a blatant riff on an old image: the cover of the band's 1992 EP, <i>Tools of the Trade</i>. So it's a testament to the strength of the material-- a set of fast, fun and, thanks to vocalist-bassist Jeff Walker, witheringly witty songs-- that <i>Surgical Steel</i> is as enjoyable as it is. The record might be calculated, but it doesn't feel forced; like <i>A Different Kind of Truth</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6895-van-halen/"" target=""_blank"">Van Halen</a>'s 2012 reunion with David Lee Roth, it's a document of middle-aged lifers trading ponderous maturity for the visceral thrills they relished in their prime.</p>
<p>The strongest songs here sum up how Carcass bridge two proud British traditions: filthy grindcore and flashy rock'n'roll. ""Cadaver Pouch Conveyor System"" finds Walker unleashing his patented sneering rasp over a blastbeat-accented thrash gallop. His longtime foil, Steer-- also an early member of Napalm Death, and an avowed blues-rock junkie who founded his own bellbottom-friendly retro act, Firebird, in 1999-- seasons the track with a Thin Lizzy–worthy melodic lead, lending Walker's gory polemic (""Total arousal/ A frigid wanton wargasm engaged/ Bloodlustmord"") an air of throwback pomp. The William Blake-referencing ""The Granulating Dark Satanic Mills"", <i>Surgical Steel</i>'s catchiest track, employs an Iron Maiden-esque midtempo feel that harks back unmistakably to <i>Heartwork</i>. The more relaxed pace allows the band to flaunt the unlikely skill they honed in their heyday: seamlessly integrating extreme-metal moves into the context of old-fashioned anthemic songcraft. Despite Walker's typically arcane lyrical turn-- a grim evocation of the Industrial Revolution-- it's not hard to imagine a rabid crowd fist-pumping along.</p>
<p><i>Surgical Steel</i> features tons of outstanding playing from Steer, as well as some of the tightest drumming in the band's discography, courtesy of new recruit Daniel Wilding. But the star of the record is undoubtedly Jeff Walker. The frontman returns to some of his pet themes here-- the horrors of the meat industry, the senselessness of war-- but he sounds improbably inspired. Though he established himself in the early 90s as one of the wittiest lyricists in metal, a connoisseur of perverse puns and obscure terms mined from a medical dictionary, Walker has lacked a proper literary outlet since Carcass imploded. (Other than a short-lived continuation of the <i>Swansong</i> lineup-- sans Steer-- under the name Blackstar, Walker's most high-profile project during Carcass' lengthy break was a 2006 record of offbeat country covers, <i>Welcome to Carcass Cuntry</i>, credited to Jeff Walker und die Fluffers.) On <i>Surgical Steel</i>, he's overflowing with ideas, as though he'd been saving up an album's worth of zingers in case his main band ever returned to active duty.</p>
<p>The record's linguistic barrage features playful tributes to John Lennon and the Stones-- ""A working class hero is something to bleed,"" ""Exiled on maim street""-- a venemous namecheck of humane-slaughterhouse advocate Temple Grandin and, on the masterfully sardonic dis track ""Noncompliance to ASTM F 899-12 Standard"", the coining of a new term (""dearth metal"") to call out tediously derivative extreme-metal practitioners. While Walker seems most at home with barbed, often darkly comedic social critique, his tone turns introspective on ""316L Grade Surgical Steel"", a disturbing portrait of a blackened heart. ""Always love the ones you hurt/ Passion killer with no time to mourn/ Cold comfort that your heart is torn/ I wish you hell-- sealed with a kiss,"" Walker spits, reminding the listener that his fixation on bodily incision extends to emotional wounds as well.</p>
<p>Most of the record lives up to the high standard set by Walker's pen. Whereas <i>Swansong</i> yielded only one live staple (""Keep on Rotting in the Free World""), it's clear that the band designed <i>Surgical Steel</i> with the stage in mind; despite these songs' off-the-charts shred quotient and countless baroque flourishes, many of them are as immediate and unshakeable as great punk. Tracks like ""The Master Butcher's Apron"" and ""Unfit for Human Consumption"" epitomize the fiendish hookiness that established Carcass as one of the most trusted brands in extreme metal. Occasionally-- as on the almost comically nimble speed-picked bridge of ""Captive Bolt Pistol""-- the band can sound like they're straining, as though they were overly concerned with convincing fans that the old maximal Carcass is back. And though 8-minute album closer ""Mount of Execution"" is a potent effort in its own right, the song's acoustic-guitar intro and proggy multichapter structure feel out of place on this otherwise admirably compact LP.</p>
<p>As a whole, though, <i>Surgical Steel</i> succeeds brilliantly in its return-to-form mission. The record plays like a big, bloody kiss planted on the cheek of longtime fans; at the same time, it's clearly a selfish statement, the overdue fulfillment of Walker and Steer's desire to rewrite their pet project's final chapter. The end of Carcass' first phase was a disappointing peter-out, but this vigorous do-over effectively reframes <i>Swansong</i> as an archival footnote. So long, dearth metal; hello, <i>Surgical Steel</i>.</p></div>"|18360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18360-carcass-surgical-steel/|7.9|Hank Shteamer

Bored with acting serious, with pretending to be well-adjusted; on ""They're Feeding,"" even the act of chewing and swallowing seems to send them into fits of tedium. Word to Harvey Danger, but ""Flagpole Sitta"" was wrong-- just because you're bored doesn't necessarily mean you're boring. Lyrically, Terry Malts may trade in a kind of all-purpose apathy, but they've smartly set that disenchantment to a Ramonesy, ""Who brought this chainsaw to the sock hop?"" permabuzz. Even when they're singing about slapping the snooze button, they rip through these songs with a focus bordering on maniacal. Nobody even runs a little leaner and meaner than 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16349-terry-malts-killing-time/"" target=""_blank""><i>Killing Time</i></a>, tamping down some of the pre-British Invasion mistiness and just flooring it. <i>Nobody</i>, at just 27 minutes and change, is an album about wasted time that doesn't give itself any time to waste.</p>
<p>This strange blend of disaffection and drive finds its way into lead singer Phil Benson's delivery. Clipped and impassioned in roughly equal measure, Benson really seems to care about not caring; in his hands, ""you ought not take yourself so serious"" is a stern admonition, ""live like there is no tomorrow"" a most forlorn-sounding YOLO. The first sound on <i>Nobody Realizes</i> is an alarm call, an unwelcome announcement of yet another day you'll be slouching your way through. Terry Malts describe this all-too-familiar draggy feeling well. But whenever it leeches into the music, <i>Nobody</i> just gets to feeling like a drag.</p>
<p>Every surface on <i>Nobody</i> is blanketed in a thick fuzz; fitting, since Terry Malts aren't the type who can be arsed to do much dusting. The grey pallor this casts over <i>Nobody</i> can get a bit oppressive, but it does the most damage to the vocals, often muddled past the point of comprehension. There's not much point in railing against something if you're not going to let anybody else in on the object of your ire. And when the lyrics don't come through, these songs seem driven by a fervor they haven't quite figured out where to direct. Even when you get the message-- work's a bore, hell is other people, moving my jaw requires too much effort-- it's all about the same;<i> Killing Time</i>'s ""Where is the Weekend"" made just about every one of <i>Nobody</i>'s listless points in 1/10th the time.</p>
<p>The playing's punchy, rarely less than impassioned. But the songs themselves are pretty much ripped right out of your pop-punk textbook, frantically careening from one power-chord to the next. After a while, <i>Nobody</i>-- frenetic but faceless, too nonchalant for true nonconformity-- starts to blur together. A song like ""Well Adjusted"", with a little more clarity on Benson's voice and a hook sharp enough to stick around for a second round, quickly recaptures your attention, but it's only temporary. Soon after, there's ""Comfortably Dumb"", its narcotic melody and tendrils of feedback lulling you into a boredom of your very own.</p></div>"|18550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18550-terry-malts-nobody-realizes-this-is-nowhere/|6.1|Paul Thompson

When the smoke clears, the first full song features a guest vocal from...<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>. Monáe is not the kind of entertainer who takes prisoners; she operates at the locus of generosity where ""generous"" shades subtly into ""aggressive."" The song is called ""Givin Em What They Love"", but the feeling is a little more ""take you home and make you like it.""</p>
<p>The facts of Monáe's emergence have occasionally made it difficult to embrace her music: She arrived so thoroughly anointed by so many key figures in the entertainment industry that it has sometimes felt pointless to try and touch her. At the heart of her ornate, impressive music, a hint of chilliness kept us at arm's-length; she was a conqueror, undoubtedly, but maybe she glossed over the whole ""winning the hearts of the people"" thing.</p>
<p>With <i>The E</i><i>lectric Lady</i>, she finds a way to give us more of herself. Together with her tight-knit Wondaland collaborators-- Kellindo Parker, a magnificent guitarist who singlehandedly gooses several songs into transcendence; her college friends Nate “Rocket” Wonder and Chuck Lightning, and Roman GianArthur-- Monáe supervises and synthesizes a parade of golden touchstones (Sly, Stevie, Marvin) into a show-stopping display of force and talent. And at the heart of it, she embeds some of the most personal pain she's allowed to leak into her music.</p>
<p>Many of her lyrics here telegraph a desire to break away, to ""find a way to freak out,"" as she puts it on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51389-watch-janelle-monae-lets-loose-in-the-new-video-for-dance-apocalyptic/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Dance Apocalyptic</a>"", which is the closest the album comes to an immediate calling card like ""Tightrope"". The album<i> </i>is overall looser and more physical than its predecessor, more concerned with dancing, sex, love, and abandon. ""I wanna scream and dream and throw a love parade,"" she sings, in a creamy mid-register, on the moonlit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a> duet ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51962-janelle-monae-shares-miguel-duet-primetime-announces-tour/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Primetime</a>"". The song rides a cerebral whine into an ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" glide, with a ""Purple Rain"" solo cascading over the top like an MGM waterfall.</p>
<p>The emotional core of the album, and its unique loneliness, derives from how Monáe both fails and succeeds to connect. She <i>wants</i> to scream and dream, she's found <i>a</i> way to freak out. The most pleading passages on <i>Electric Lady</i>-- gorgeously tender soul ballads like ""It's Code"" and ""Can't Live Without Your Love""-- feature some of her most emotionally bare, strikingly abject singing. But for all of the sex-positive, queer-friendly utopianism of her music (one between-song skit advertises a ""bouncing electro booty contest""; on the title track, she pictures ""all the birds and the bees dancing with the freaks in the trees""; and on the Erykah Badu-featuring ""Q.U.E.E.N."", she asks playfully, ""Is it weird to like the way she wears her tights?""), her music has always been about the the exhilaration coming from the sensation of total control.</p>
<p>Attention to detail is nothing new for the admittedly obsessive Monáe, but man, there are some knockout details here: the rusty poking bedspring of a guitar that powers ""Q.U.E.E.N.""; the percussion loops on ""Electric Lady""; the manic clean-toned jazz guitar skittering behind the vocal breakdown on ""Ghetto Woman"". The strings carry some of the most heart-tugging melodies, and the most beautiful moments come when songs melt from an amped-up funk groove into a glimmering, soul-revue orchestra, like ""We Were Rock and Roll"", ""Give Em What You Love"", and ""Q.U.E.E.N"". Gorgeous soul ballads like ""Can't Live Without Your Love"" are built on the kind of rich, finely managed melodies and jazzy modulations that haven't been the sound of the radio since the late 70s.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, <i>The E</i><i>lectric Lady</i> is a convincing argument for the virtues of micromanagement, but some of the most powerful, tender moments come from acknowledging  limits. On ""Sally Ride,"" she admits defeat, of sorts, declaring she's ""packing my spacesuit, and I'm taking my shit up to the moon."" On ""Victory,"" Monáe offers, ""I'll just keep singing until the pain goes,"" and there's something humbly stoic in her voice. She's not singing to <i>exorcise</i> pain, which will hang around until it's good and ready to go, she's just passing the time until it does doing the thing she does best.</p></div>"|18470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18470-janelle-monae-the-electric-lady/|8.3|Jayson Greene

Both play only guitar. Their songs are slow and sometimes static, an effect enhanced by the near-total absence of beats (and, in concert, by the slowed-down films projected behind them). Gordon sings mostly in monotone, spreading her words out in a glacial rap or moaning them in a breathy whisper. The mood is similarly confined, sticking to a strident heaviness through serious lyrics and dirge-like guitar.</p>
<p>This limited palette could feel claustrophobic, or just boring. But on Body/Head’s first full-length album <i>Coming Apart</i>, the duo treat it as a challenge, like the straitjacket a magician dons to prove he can break free. (Not coincidentally, the album is named after a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064180/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1969 movie</a> set in a single apartment and shot from a single camera angle). In nearly 70 minutes of music over two LPs, Gordon and Nace burrow deep into their narrow sound, mining it for more variety and emotion than it should rightfully hold. The effect is subtle-- at first the music feels aimless, in search of something vague and elusive. But give <i>Coming Apart </i>a few listens, and distinctive shapes emerge. Eventually, the duo’s dedication to a specific point of view becomes intoxicating.</p>
<p>That dedication shows up most strongly in the conversational guitar work of Gordon and Nace (himself a veteran of many excellent <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Bill+Nace"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collaborations</a>). Oddly, the duo chose to pan their individual sounds to opposite sides of the stereo space. But rather than making them feel disconnected, that tactic gives their interplay a call-and-response synchronicity. When one of them hits repetitive chords or plucks two-note patterns, the other weaves long tones or dense distortion; at other times, one’s left turn into dissonance inspires the other to find melody in the noise. (The chiming quality of that noise sometimes recalls <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evol"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Evol</a>-</i>era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>, but there are many other evocations in the pair’s timbres.) The timing of these actions and reactions makes <i>Coming Apart </i>surprisingly engaging-- though all 10 pieces were mostly improvised, many have an arc that’s thoughtfully song-like.</p>
<p>Even more engaging is Gordon’s singing, which is as expressive as anything she did in Sonic Youth, and often more so. She stretches out syllables, expands phrases, and melts her voice into the rising guitar lava. At times it seems she’s simply exploring the way words <i>sound</i>, treating them like physical objects sliding up her throat and pouring off her tongue. At other points, the concrete meaning of her lyrics is all that matters. So when her simple yell of the title in “Actress” turns urgent, it suddenly sounds like the most important word in the world.</p>
<p>Gordon’s voice also provides an entry point into tunes, which can otherwise be a bit forbidding. But it’s also easy to get lost in them, much the way the most intense work by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/"">Jandek</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a> can take on the quality of a dream. As in dreams, time on <i>Coming Apart </i>becomes a moving target, and sometimes seems to disappear altogether. As a result, these songs often feel longer than they actually are-- but this is the rare case where that’s a strength rather than a weakness.</p>
<p>Still, given the music’s endless feel, closing <i>Coming Apart </i>with its two longest tracks is risky. But Gordon and Nace manage to find new ideas in these elongated settings. 17-minute closer “Frontal” is like an album unto itself, gradually moving from distant echoes to the duo’s most aggressive tones. Its predecessor, “Black”, is even more mesmerizing. It’s ostensibly a cover of the traditional folk song <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Is_the_Colour_(Of_My_True_Love's_Hair)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Black Is the Colour (Of My True Love's Hair)”</a>, but Gordon was likely inspired by one version in particular: the radical <a href=""http://youtu.be/9NSBVjRxgF4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">take</a> recorded by singer Patty Waters and her free-jazz group in the late 60s.</p>
<p>Gordon doesn’t get as frantic or desperate sounding as Waters; in keeping with the album’s tone, her interpretation is darker and heavier. But it’s just as radical. Waiting almost seven minutes before singing, Gordon reworks simple stanzas into zombie mantras, eventually duetting with herself in a chorus of abstract hums. The re-imagining is typical of her career, which has featured more detours than she’s perhaps been given credit for. Count <i>Coming Apart </i>as another fascinating step in that journey, and Body/Head’s musical path as one that she and Nace will hopefully follow for a long time.</p></div>"|18471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18471-bodyhead-coming-apart/|7.7|Marc Masters

The obvious play is to acknowledge it as part of the ongoing maturation of Man Man, yet it always feels strange talking about “maturity” for a band that never sounded young. That isn’t to say Man Man sounded <i>old</i>, as in tired and tame. It’s more in the sense that everything from Honus Honus’ lupine howling to their dilapidated percussion warranted adjectives like “grizzled,” “feral,” “untamed.” The junkyard dog descriptor made sense-- Man Man sounded like a band that lived on scraps and aged seven times quicker than everyone else. But really, “maturity” is something of a feint listening to <i>On Oni Pond. </i>Perhaps they’re becoming more “adult”, in that while Man Man puts forth the outer appearance of having their shit together, on the inside, their darker impulses are repressed into something more grotesque and frightening.</p>
<p>But at first, what you’ll notice is the utter lack of the kind of squealing, squawking affectations that could clear the room on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5621-the-man-in-a-blue-turban-with-a-face/"">The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face</a> </i>or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5622-six-demon-bag/"">Six Demon Bag</a>. </i>As with 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15383-life-fantastic"">Life Fantastic</a>,</i> Saddle Creek majordomo Mike Mogis produces and more than ever, Man Man's reliance on pure rhythm becomes readily apparent-- I hesitate to call <i>On Oni Pond </i>a “danceable” record or even “funky”, though it’s got groove and Honus’ lyrics often function like chants, regardless of how verbose they are. I couldn’t imagine this getting booted off any radio playlist, but I think of <i>On Oni Pond </i>as positioning Man Man as an offbeat version of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"">My Morning Jacket</a> or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective"">Animal Collective</a>-- rootsy and rooted in indie, but now a big deal rock band with a body-moving impulse that puts them up for pretty much every festival other than Warped Tour or Rock the Bells.</p>
<p>By the same token, Man Man’s confrontational edge happened to be one of their greatest assets. Previous piano ballads like “Van Helsing Boombox” and “Rabbit Habits” were certainly heartbreaking due to their despondent lyrics, but there was an endearing, pathetic nature to the sound that drove the point home-- here was a guy unlucky at love, trying as hard as he can to make typically “pretty” music and failing. First single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15729-man-man-head-on"">“Head On”</a> is sweetened with a classic soul melody, strings and Honus’ chin-up solace directed at one of those poor souls who might’ve related to the aforementioned:  “hold onto your heart/ never let nobody take it over.”</p>
<p>But don’t take “Head On” as being indicative of the lyrical direction here. <i>On Oni Pond </i>shifts Honus’ attention from the paranoia and morbidity that marked <i>Life Fantastic<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15383-life-fantastic""> </a></i>to what can be heard as a concept album about male sexual futility. This is a theme that’s hardly new for Man Man. But while Honus is one of indie’s most lecherous lyricists, there’s always been a sadomasochistic bite to it. Here, there’s something of paradoxical swagger is in his ability to empathize with those getting no satisfaction. The inability to get one’s rocks off is arguably the lifeblood of rock and roll, and people tend to do crazy shit when engorged-- for example, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5758-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea"">using Anne Frank as a psychosexual muse</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14010-the-monitor"">having the Civil War serve as a contextual framework for a tough time at college</a>. Maybe you think it’s tasteless and even insulting for Honus to evoke Guantanamo, conflict diamonds and “that child raised by Kony,"" but he’s flexing and realizing his subject matter is inherently absurd. Just as often, the humor results in some real groaners (a played-out <i>Silence of the Lambs </i>reference, the faux-Oriental vocals on “Pink Wonton”, the <i>title </i>of “Pink Wonton”) and the narrowness of the subject matter can feel stifling for everyone involved-- the self-explanatory submission fantasy “Loot My Body” is the first song to really feel like Man Man madlibs.</p>
<p>The worry here is that maturity might actually mean Man Man getting stuck in their ways, though “End Boss” can be read as a self-aware self-help talk: “if you won’t reinvent yourself/ you can’t circumvent your hell.” And if “Fangs” isn’t a late-album intervention, it’s a certainly a welcome acknowledgement of the other side in the war of the sexes. It’s not the first time Honus has written about a woman with something to hide. But unlike the murderous cross-dresser of “Poor Jackie”, the subject here is more relatable, someone who “had a fantasy of being the female Steve McQueen” but instead, “hides her fangs/ behind her back … pretends to laugh/ at the boxes she’s been born in.” Like most songs of this nature, there’s the threat of Man Man being far longer on good intentions than keen insight. Fortunately, “Fangs” avoids condescension as the rest of <i>On Oni Pond </i>serves as an unintentional vindication for Honus’ viewpoint here: when you consider the horny, slobbering suckers that populate the majority of Man Man songs, you might <i>begin</i> to understand how shitty it must be to have to deal with it all. So while softer and more empathetic the band isn’t quite tamed yet; <i>On Oni Pond </i>is a Man Man album through and through, delivering an occasionally bizarre and fantastical look at the very real human condition. </p></div>"|18387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18387-man-man-on-oni-pond/|6.4|Ian Cohen

She sings this more than once on the opening song of her new digital-only solo EP, and I believe her. Sure, saying you don't have time to play it cool can be a way of playing it cool. I get that. It's why <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"" target=""_blank"">Smashing Pumpkins</a> fans are supposed to hate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a>. But with London foursome <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28963-allo-darlin/"" target=""_blank"">Allo Darlin'</a>, Morris has fronted two albums that don't just bare the type of vulnerable lyrical and musical details other artists might just as reasonably choose to smooth over. Her band has also conveyed a signature style-- plainspoken wistfulness, lilting melodies, and ukulele-centered bounce-- with unmistakable craft. Enough to make Allo Darlin' the best hope out there to carry the indie-pop flame from forebears like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Camera Obscura</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2550-the-lucksmiths/"" target=""_blank"">the Lucksmiths</a>.</p>
<p><i>Optimism</i>, a four-song effort Morris recorded live with Hefner's Darren Hayman and released unceremoniously via <a href=""http://elizabethmorris.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a>, further highlights both the unaffected charm and the careful artistry. At the same time, Morris nimbly sidesteps aspects of that style at an instant when it has arguably gained its most mainstream popularity. Where ""Some People Say,"" from Allo Darlin's 2012 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16502-europe/""><i>Europe</i></a>, echoed Paramore's Hayley Williams (herself echoing Billy Bragg and Kirsty MacColl) on B.o.B.'s 2010 Top 40 mainstay <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn6-c223DUU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Airplanes""</a>, Paramore's latest album includes Morris-like ukulele <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGUF5uX4NuM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interludes</a>. Taylor Swift's <i>Red</i>, meanwhile, features a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3d5-2rNI38"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jangly song</a> that recalls the everyday storytelling of not just Allo Darlin', but specifically Swedish indie-popper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5014-hello-saferide/"" target=""_blank"">Hello Saferide</a> (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5248-sakert/"" target=""_blank"">Säkert!</a>). There's room for those more commercial artists' fans here, too, but not because of any pandering to faddish quirk-seekers.</p>
<p>In fact, paradoxically enough, <i>Optimism</i> is the closest Morris has come to a singer-songwriter record. She trades her familiar ukulele and bounding full-band backing for piano or acoustic guitar in an unadorned setting, complete with overheard room ambiance. If the relatively slight nature of the release and the familiar quality to the lyrics keep <i>Optimism</i> from ever quite outdoing the best of Allo Darlin', that same casualness and sense of a recognizable personality behind the songs also helps make the most devastating moments all the more effective. Most of all, though, the EP confirms that no matter how bare the recordings, the lyrical sentiments, or the arrangements, Morris is a keenly observational songwriter with a knack for turning a phrase, and whatever she does next will merit watching.</p>
<p>The two piano-based songs are the sharpest shift here musically from Allo Darlin'. Morris has said she wrote them on her great-great-great grandmother's instrument, a wedding gift that traveled from Germany to the singer's native Australia in the 1850s, but she recorded them on a small-scale ""ship's piano"" owned by Hayman in London. The previously mentioned opener, the autumnal ""Young Republic"", contemplates a place where ""guilt and fear and loss and shame"" are banned, as the narrator opens up about ""how much I like you"" (speaking of opening up: the ""autumnal"" descriptor is all but implied by the lyrics, which mention preferring the fall-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11774-rocky-dennis-epmaple-leaves-ep/"">the season</a>, not necessarily <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the band</a>). The more bittersweet title track returns to Morris' love affair with pop-music references, but that only deftly distracts from more crushing feelings. If you can't relate to the part where she sings about lovingly writing a name in her notebook, but having to make sure the person isn't looking, you probably won't have read this far.</p>
<p>Again, though, <i>Optimism</i> isn't just relatable, ordinary; it's also the product of extraordinary effort and unrelatable skill. ""Shoe Box"", the newest composition here and the first of two songs played on guitar, is a wonderful jumble of all the above. I can imagine someone turning it into a parody of Morris songs-- the percussive strums, the lines that start with ""and"" and ""so"" like off-the-cuff placeholders, the constant themes about long-distance romance, the conscious naïveté. (""What is it like to be 80?"" alone could launch a thousand snarky RTs.) But Morris' willingness to reveal the limits to her knowledge strikes me as brave and honest, the idea of grappling with moving ""a box of photographs that aren't you"" just kills me, and I have a soft spot for her playfully elaborate rhymes: ""aperture"" and ""camera,"" ""picture"" and ""kiss ya""-- in Morris' homespun Australian accent, these will either make you cringe or grin. You already know where I land.</p>
<p>For current Allo Darlin' fans, then, the <i>Optimism</i> EP will be like a ridiculously talented friend leaving songs on your voicemail-- well worth the £3 ($4.68) if only to be able to carry the music around with you and support an artist you like. If any track is a little less strong than the others, it's acoustic ballad ""Sweetheart"", but only because Morris' stripped-down cover of a banjo-twangy song by recent tourmates Wave Pictures can't possibly match the distinctive voice of her originals. It's still a deeply poignant listen for those who have ears to hear it, though, and maybe what's optimistic about the record is her hope there are more of us out there.</p>
<p>It helps, too, that ""Sweetheart"" is an apt choice for this project: ""I will write you without poetry,"" Morris sings. It's another way of saying she won't play it cool, one more theme that recurs from <i>Europe</i>; on ""The Letter,"" she imagined telling a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/"">Silver Jews</a>-loving romantic interest she ""was never cool."" It was awesome. As Allo Darlin' record their next album, tentatively titled <i>We Come From The Same Place</i>, it's worth remembering Morris' greatest gift is for turning the prosaic into the poetic, all the same.</p></div>"|18546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18546-elizabeth-morris-optimism/|7.5|Marc Hogan

In 2009 she put out <a href=""http://emilyreo.bandcamp.com/album/minha-gatinha"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Minha Gatinha</i></a>, an album of narcotized dream-pop that sounded like she'd been on a steady diet of Neil Young’s honey slides (she also covered <a href=""http://emilyreo.bandcamp.com/album/on-the-beach"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“On the Beach”</a>, capturing and translating the song's despair for a bedroom recording generation that spent the last three years stuck on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9502-beach-house/""><i>Beach House</i></a>). In the years following, the Orlando-born singer and synth manipulator’s output came to a standstill as she moved from Florida to New York, Boston, and Los Angeles. <i>Olive Juice</i>, Reo’s first official release in several years-- even though five of the album’s eight songs have already been around for awhile in different form-- shows she’s gone a long way musically as well. Though her vinyl debut and sophomore record still moves along at a resting heart rate, she's shed the heavy-lidded haze that swaddled these songs the first time around.</p>
<p><i>Olive Juice</i> is Reo’s first album for Elestial Sounds, the Gainesville-based record label and collective behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30274-hundred-waters/"">Hundred Waters</a> and Levek. It’s the perfect platform for Reo, who also belongs to FMLY, a “DIT” (do it together) assemblage of visual artists, musicians, and other creatives. That nurturing community has always been an important part of Reo’s work-- when she covered <a href=""http://vimeo.com/36627491%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill’s “Car”</a> at FMLY Fest last year, by the end of the song at least one audience member was cradled in another’s lap, which is kind of what her music makes one feel like doing. On <i>Minha Gatinha</i>, that manifested itself as lo-fi murmurs suitable for times when drifting off to sleep starts to sound more appealing than being awake, like rainy afternoons or staying up late enough to <a href=""http://www.dumdumzine.net/text-message-interview-with-emily-reo-3-bryxan-amsterdam/%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">watch the sun rise</a>. That warm and fuzzy feeling doesn't come through quite as strongly on <i>Olive Juice, </i>whose comparatively crystal-clear production value can take some time to get used to. But the songs sound much better now that you can actually hear them.</p>
<p>“Car” is a pretty good example, especially since the lyrics “I want specifics/ On a general idea” may as well be about <i>Olive Juice</i>. Like “On the Beach”, Reo's <a href=""http://emilyreo.bandcamp.com/album/car"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2010 version</a> of the cover nearly drowns out her voice in reverb, and the volume is turned way up on the original’s buzzing organs. With different tools at her disposal this time-- namely, a recording studio-- she sharpens the focus, leaving room for harder-hitting drums and a more coherent structure. More importantly, Reo’s voice is now front and center, loaded and plaintive like Doug Martsch’s and kaleidoscopic with her own echoes. Those same edits hold true for her other re-released songs: titles have been tightened (“Wind Can’t Hear You” is now “Wind”, “Metal on Your Skin” became “Metal”, etc.), rhythms made more pronounced, and tape-deck dust swept away to reveal a palette of bright synth colors. The keyboard warbles at the beginning of “Wind” aren’t unlike those at the beginning of the Postal Service’s “Clark Gable,” and Reo’s multi-tracked vocals nod to Imogen Heap’s harmonies on “Hide and Seek”.</p>
<p>A new album of mostly reissues that’s not billed as a re-release might seem like cheating, but Reo has said she views <i>Minha Gatinha</i> as a collection of demos made while she was still learning how to write and record songs, which makes sense. <i>Olive Juice</i>, then, is a natural artistic progression, even more so now that her old songs fit like puzzle pieces with the new ones. Such consistent aesthetics might prove limiting as Reo writes more new material, but until she sets her sights on something grander, they’re perfectly lovely.</p></div>"|18551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18551-emily-reo-olive-juice/|7.0|Harley Brown

Kelly</a>, perhaps it becomes his latest conceptual dramedy, an inset of the geography surveyed on “Sex Planet”. For <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7719-robin-thicke"" target=""_blank"">Robin Thicke</a>, it could serve as more proof of his insatiable need to be liked and his utter inability to look cool. Like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17736-justin-timberlake-the-2020-experience"" target=""_blank"">The 20/20 Experience</a></i>, the name <i>Kiss Land</i> brings to mind a family-friendly theme park overseen by pop music’s most tireless crowd pleaser. And if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel"" target=""_blank"">Miguel</a> made a song called “Kiss Land”, it could be delivered with a wink, total sincerity, or, most likely, some combination thereof. But it's the name of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>’s first true major-label release, and the title track boasts characteristically lecherous lines like ""not really into kisses leading into nothing."" As such, <i>Kiss Land</i> scans as unintentionally hilarious, a sign that the project is rushing headlong into self-parody and Abel Tesfaye seems to be the only one who doesn’t realize it.</p>
<p>Given that, it makes sense that Tesfaye has followed up<i> </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17280-the-trilogy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Trilogy</i></a>, a compilation of his highly influential and gripping 2011 mixtapes, with the rock'n'roll trope that results from ego and self-awareness becoming inversely proportional: a concept album about “life on the road."" I could tell you that <i>Kiss Land</i> is dolorous, hook-averse, emotionally despondent, and says appalling things to women 85% of the time, but that was also true of <i>Trilogy</i>. Thing is, the earlier material also had some indelible melodies (mostly on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/""><i>House of Balloons</i></a>), innovative textures (mostly on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15754-thursday/""><i>Thursday</i></a>), and all-consuming atmosphere (mostly on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16134-echoes-of-silence/""><i>Echoes of Silence</i></a>). <i>Kiss Land</i> does manage some of the latter two qualities, but to seriously diminishing returns. </p>
<p>While it doesn’t stretch far beyond the boundaries established by <i>Trilogy</i>, <i>Kiss Land</i> is a reflection of the Weeknd’s new reality, of what happens when studio nerds have access to massive appearance fees and the finest engineers in the world. A disembodied <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30112-emika"">Emika</a> sample and lithe, menacing drum programming evoke an android sadness on “Professional” that makes Tesfaye actually sound believable when he tries to turn the V.I.P. into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AqeqAQ1ILI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Atrocity Exhibition”</a>. On “Adaptation”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7099-the-police/"">the Police</a> sound as threatening as any of the dancehall apparitions that haunted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus""><i>Yeezus</i></a>, while on “Belong to the World”, the percussion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead"">Portishead</a>’s “Machine Gun” is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51565-the-weeknd-says-theres-no-portishead-sample-on-belong-to-the-world-according-to-geoff-barrow/"">slightly reconfigured</a> and jacked up to punishing speed. The best songs here bring the Weeknd closer to where the project started on the comparitively pop-oriented <i>House of Balloons</i>. “Wanderlust” is springy disco that moves with unusual vigor, and in pitching up its vocal samples rather than screwing them down, it imparts Tesfaye getting caught up in the moment, left a little breathless. And while the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> feature “Live For” is more or less a rewrite of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16039-take-care/"" target=""_blank"">Take Care</a>’</i>s “Crew Love”, it signifies happiness even if it doesn’t express it. Otherwise, without any strong melodic tether, songs drift by like the window view from a redeye flight, where the free champagne blurs the bloodshot sunrises and indistinguishable cloud banks.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">So while <i>Kiss Land </i>creates an immersive atmosphere, it rarely feels grounded with a sense of place. </span>On <i>Trilogy</i>, Toronto established a tangible setting, where Tesfaye was beginning to become a “somebody in a nobody town”, to quote “Professional”. Sure, he was palling around with Drake and was a star by the time the set was halfway finished, but he was still subject to freezing winters, hanging around club kids still living with their parents, “drinking Alize with our cereal for breakfast.” On “Kiss Land”, Tesfaye moans “I went from staring at the same four walls for 21 years/ To seeing the whole world in just 12 months.” Judging from the results, it's as if the Weeknd has traveled the world only for Tesfaye to realize it revolves around him.</p>
<p>The lyrics are often embarrassing, occasionally nonsensical and not worth quoting at length-- just know that ""You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free/ You gotta pay with your body"" is representative. Everyone here is complicit and compromised, which is key to understanding the draw of such overtly nihilistic music. Overfamiliarity aside, its joylessness becomes some kind of perverse asset. The Weeknd’s world is cruel, but unbiased; the accusations of misogyny are tempered (somewhat) by the fact that Tesfaye appears to mistrust <i>everyone</i> equally, with the exception of Drake. After relaying his frightening regimen of vices during the title track’s unhinged coda, he can only offer the misanthropic defensiveness of an addict: “This ain’t nothing to relate to even if you tried.” Point being, steer clear unless you plan to be as high as he is and are ready to indulge in whatever sexual command strikes his fancy. That's the only lesson in <i>Kiss Land</i>, because Tesfaye at least realizes he’s in no position to judge and doesn’t even seek redemption or your understanding. </p>
<p>The deluxe version of <i>Kiss Land </i>contains a radio remix of “Wanderlust” that isn’t necessary to ensure the record’s success, not when the Weeknd is already playing Radio City Music Hall and Los Angeles’ Greek Theatre <i>twice</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell"" target=""_blank"">Pharrell</a> lends a funkier, lighter production touch to the song but his mere presence is revelatory. As post-Weeknd acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31651-banks/"">Banks</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18284-partynextdoor-partynextdoor"">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a> crop up, Pharrell serves as a reminder that the R&amp;B/pop zeitgeist consists of songs like “Blurred Lines”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15320-daft-punk-get-lucky-ft-pharrell"" target=""_blank"">“Get Lucky”</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51634-video-justin-timberlake-take-back-the-night"" target=""_blank"">“Take Back The Night”</a>. These songs might not be a reaction to the Weeknd, but they do suggest that love is more than sex and sex is more than just a transaction. These loving and lovable songs serve as soundtracks for people who go on silly dates, make asses out of themselves at karaoke, get married, attend Bar Mitzvahs, and are capable as seeing everyone and everything as something other than an enabler.  </p>
<p>And that turns out to be a lot of us. <i>Kiss Land </i>is technically the Weeknd’s fourth album in two and a half years, and without the ear-turning innovation of the earlier work, all you can muster in reaction to its worldview, the same one that's been delivered repeatedly without variation, is, “Maybe it’s <i>you</i>, man.” Which in a way, vindicates it: <i>Kiss Land</i> sounds every bit as isolated and singular as Tesfaye feels.</p></div>"|18458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18458-the-weeknd-kiss-land/|6.2|Ian Cohen

He shed a few band members during the hiatus, but thankfully not his interest in eventually returning to Califone. He just didn’t want to go back exactly like he had before. For the new <i>Stitches, </i>Rutili hit the road, leaving his familiar environs in Chicago and recording at various locations in the southwestern United States, including Arizona, Texas, and Southern California. He also went back to his roots in home recording, stripping back the dense tangle of rustic instrumentation, electronic atmospherics, and spooky field recordings that distinguished Califone’s past work.</p>
<p>All of those elements exist on <i>Stitches, </i>but in a much less expansive way. This record resides entirely inside Rutili’s head, and conveys his point of view during a solitary period spent amid blank, sun-drenched landscapes. Given Rutili’s cinematic sensibility, it’s no surprise that <i>Stitches </i>often plays like a downbeat existential western from the early 70s. The breathtakingly pretty “moonbath.brainsalt.a.holy.fool” is indicative of the mood on <i>Stitches-- </i>the ticking plunk of piano chords set against sweeping steel guitar sighs instantly conjures images of tumbleweeds blowing across a desolate desert at sunset, presumably as the hero of the story attempts to grapple with some crippling emotional crisis. It doesn’t rise or fall so much as smolder in one place for several minutes. “A Thin Skin of Bullfight Dust” also builds without ever reaching a climax, even as a skittering drum machine causes friction with a glistening banjo lick and dark clouds of disembodied noise.</p>
<p>Califone’s music has always been rooted in this tension between technology and humanity. But on <i>Stitches, </i>Rutili leans a little more heavily on the human element. It’s not strictly a singer-songwriter record, though the focus on Rutili’s vocals and the songwriting is more pronounced than usual-- like on “Movie Music Kills a Kiss,” where the song is framed simply by a plaintive acoustic strum, stinging slide-guitar asides, and a trickling piano. At times, <i>Stitches </i>sounds more like a collection of demos for a Califone record than a Califone record, which suits the starkness of the material. After all, people don’t head to the desert unless they’re hiding from something, and the demons that Rutili describes on <i>Stitches </i>seem particularly druggy and apocalyptic. The lyrics are cryptic and hallucinatory. (“The ghost of you comes clear as day/ emerging from the dark room chemicals,” Rutili sings on “Movie Music Kills a Kiss"".) “Magdalene” and “Moses” directly reference Biblical stories about sin and salvation. Even when it’s not always clear what Rutili is talking about on <i>Stitches, </i>the music evokes an unsettling spiritual reckoning.</p>
<p>In total, <i>Stitches is</i> exactly the sort of Americana record that can act as antidote for what’s happening in the genre right now. At a time when “hey!” folk has fully infiltrated rock radio, and made questionably bearded banjo players the guitar shredders of this generation, somebody has to stand up and represent how truly weird and wondrous this music can be. <i>Stitches </i>isn’t a record designed to bowl anybody over-- It eschews easy Mumford-like payoffs. Like desert sand, it slowly washes over until it finally crushes you. <i> </i></p></div>"|18438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18438-califone-stitches/|7.3|Steven Hyden

Once a dominating force in Atlanta’s Dungeon Family collective (which also included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">OutKast</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"" target=""_blank"">Killer Mike</a> and more), the rap quartet hasn’t recorded together in full since 1999’s <i>World Party</i>, a flirtation with pop sensibilities so out of step with the down-home grooves of well-received early albums <i>Soul Food and Still Standing</i> that it reportedly motivated one of the members to leave the group. That defector, one <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/910-cee-lo-green/"" target=""_blank"">Cee-Lo Green</a>, spent the intervening years in hot pursuit of mainstream success, an effort that took him from the accomplished backwoods soul-rap fusion of 2002’s <i>Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections</i> through left-field smashes with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Danger Mouse</a> in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1866-gnarls-barkley/"" target=""_blank"">Gnarls Barkley</a> (""Crazy"") and as a solo artist for 2010’s near-ubiquitous novelty hit “Fuck You”. (More recently Cee-Lo has worked as a judge on the NBC singing contest ""The Voice."") Nowadays Cee-Lo’s a soul singer with the juice to push almost 200,000 units of a Christmas album with guest appearances from Christina Aguilera and the Muppets. It’s quite possible that a good portion of his new fanbase has no idea that he raps.<br/><br/>Getting the band back together seems counterintuitive to Cee-Lo’s career trajectory, but it maybe makes sense for the rest of the group. Goodie Mob reformed as a trio for 2004’s pithily titled <i>One Monkey Don’t Stop No Show</i> but quickly disintegrated after it bombed. In that sense, the reunited foursome’s just-released <i>Age Against the Machine</i> mirrors the Jacksons’ post-<i>Thriller</i> reunion album <i>Victory</i>, whose primary purpose, it seemed, was to filter the breakout success of Michael back through the rest of the family. <i>Age Against the Machine</i>’s got great songs, but it’s jerky and frustratingly beholden to the whims of its cash cow. Where previous group efforts were borne out of what appeared to be a democratic songwriting process, quite a few of the songs here are essentially glorified Cee-Lo solo cuts. It works for the race conscious pop nugget “Power” (formerly “White Power”) and the blistering state of hip-hop address “Nexperiance”, an update on <i>Still Standing</i>’s “The Experience”. But we also get the kitschy “Amy” (Actual lyric: “My very first white girl/ Golly gee she sure was fine”) and overwrought productions like “Come as You Are” and “Ghost of Gloria Goodchild”.<br/><br/><i>Age Against the Machine</i> functions best when it’s not reaching. Brass tacks rap cuts like “Vallelujah” win for dispensing with the gimmicky pop-soul of the Cee-Lo tracks. When “Pinstripes” lobs shots at Atlanta’s trap elite and “Special Education” suggests that “V.I.P. stands for ‘very insecure people,’” Goodie Mob begins to tiptoe back into the brusque, mystical conscious rap of the Dungeon Family’s heyday. The group sounds energized on these numbers, doling out hard-fought wisdom over the gritty electronic bounce of <i>Age Against the Machine</i>’s production like seasoned veterans. Cee-Lo proves his rap skills haven’t tarnished as well; he matches wits with T.I. on “Pinstripes” and fires off streetwise darts like “I’m still street, and I kill to eat/ The life of a nigga is still cheap” and “I’m a ‘caine baker and a rainmaker and a chain taker and a brain breaker” with an aplomb that belies his years-long leave of absence from rap. A few more songs like these, and this thing would’ve been a barn burner.<br/><br/>The album falters in spots because of the disparity of its urges. <i>Age Against the Machine</i> seems to want to ease Cee-Lo back into the Goodie Mob’s world while not-so-gently tugging them into his. But the true Goodie Mob reunion effort and the experimental Cee-Lo rap project vying for control here don’t jibe particularly well with one another, a disconnect that’s further exacerbated by a glut of interstitial skits tasked with maneuvering in and out of the album’s sharp turns. The more traditional Goodie Mob tracks lean into <i>Age Against the Machine</i>’s sense of occasion; both in title and in content, the album presents itself as a righteous rejoinder to the moral bankruptcy of Atlanta trap from a cadre of the city’s elder statesmen. But as soon as that mood is established, a Cee-Lo song drops by and dashes it to bits. “The prodigal son has returned,” as Dungeon Family spoken word artist Big Rube says on opener “U Don’t Know What You Got”. He’s back, but he’s taken over the house and filled it with showy Broadway pomp.</p></div>"|18444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18444-goodie-mob-age-against-the-machine/|6.8|Craig Jenkins

Blending sweeping classical and rock instrumentation with glitchy beats, ambient electronics, and stagy vocals, their music ""taps into a spirit of childlike wonder.""

<p>For all of the inventiveness at the level of fine detail, the broad strokes of <i>Smilewound</i> are very broad indeed. Most of the songs fuse-- with variable coherence-- misty, fractured classical melodies with sputtering, runaway rhythm and tone programming, so lovingly wrought and kaleidoscopically contoured as to throw the instrumental work and songwriting in the shade. The slow dance of strings and piano on opener ""Toothwheels"" is several orders of magnitude less interesting than the roiling, spitting drums; the same goes for the sustain-drenched piano chords and jackrabbit-heartbeat  rhythm patterns of ""Underwater Snow"". The mixed message of that title becomes even more confusing when paired with cooed lyrics about being a moon on fire, emblematic of an album where good ideas don't quite snap into focus.</p>
<p>It's remarkable that an album with so much fast, dynamic percussion still has such a lugubrious pace, which makes all the sharp details drift by in an indistinct mass. Eternity is the wait for anything to happen on ""Eternity is the Wait Between Breaths"", before a bell ostinato and some throttled strings give its opening stretch of synthetic seagull squawks any form. The music is usually tauter than that, but it's consistently slackened by the vocals of returning original member Gyða Valtýsdóttir, who replaces the divisive but unique voice of twin sister Kristín with an approachable but anonymous one. There's no expressive or dynamic inflection in her single vocal timbre, chaste and emotionally flat, which results in some of the most sexless music this side of 80s hardcore. Most glaringly on ""Sweet Impressions"", the vocal melodies are often supremely inert: Each. Word. Just. Sits. There.</p>
<p>The album's best tracks hint at a svelte, engaging electro-pop album lurking somewhere under the twee mannerisms. On the perky and awakening ""When Girls Collide"", 8-bit synths and skippy acid basses rocket around a meandering placeholder of a vocal. The waxwork singing comes to life on ""Slow Down"", with refreshingly staggered phrasing among big, gasping, reverb-brushed electronic chords, making for an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">xx</a>-like moment on an album that could use more of that scrappy, sensual cool. The electronic track of ""Candlestick"" smashes through filter after filter like a locomotive, but again, a sparse vocal squanders the pop opportunity. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2782-kylie-minogue/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Kylie Minogue</a>, appearing on bonus track ""Whistle"", is a positive influence: The strong, lucid vocal line creates a center of gravity for the rippling matrix of synthetic twinkles, patty-cake percussion, and plumes of post-classical grandeur. Múm have a fine way with surface texture, but more of that core sturdiness would go a long way toward making their music feel as a wondrous as it tries to sound.</p></div>"|18453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18453-mum-smilewound/|5.7|Brian Howe

<p>As that connection indicates, the Stepkids are best seen, not as some kind of novelty throwback act, but as one of several projects emerging in a burgeoning West Coast scene, including the Odd Future associated acts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29960-the-internet/"" target=""_blank"">the Internet</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31414-the-jet-age-of-tomorrow/"" target=""_blank"">the Jet Age of Tomorrow</a>, as well as older luminaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"" target=""_blank"">Dâm-Funk</a>. The Connecticut trio can sound as if they’re splitting the difference between their Stones Throw brethren <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5788-james-pants/"" target=""_blank"">James Pants</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28044-mayer-hawthorne/"" target=""_blank"">Mayer Hawthorne</a>, making vintage-sounding soul that occasionally slides over into full-on funk. Their new album, <i>Troubadour,</i> is a loose concept album about an “insecure” singer character for whom “night is his day, work is his play,” and “words are his pay.” </p>
<p>The concept is a bit of a macguffin though. Vocalist/drummer Tim Walsh confessed to <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/10/stepkids-standing-on-the-shoulders-of-passion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Guardian</i></a> that the songs on <i>Troubadour </i>are “pretty autobiographical.” And indeed, a dearth of imagination in the songwriting on the album pinpoints the lyrics as the last remaining weakness of the Stepkids experience. The songs can be ­­difficult to set apart from your everyday pop boilerplate: On “Bitter Bug,” the worst offender, the listener is subjected to ideas like “life on the road is crazy,” and “it takes a lot of patience, to deal with these situations.”</p>
<p>But “Bitter Bug,” for all of its grating lines, is one of several bona fide pop songs on <i>Troubadour </i>that take the record beyond its self-titled predecessor and make it, in many places, a dynamite listen. The song structures here are fantastic. “Bitter Bug"" enters with so much fanfare-- resounding bass, ecstatic vocal backdrops-- that only the most Grinch-like of listeners is likely to hold the lyrics against it. “Desert in the Dark,” (a remix of which showed up on the Jet Age’s recent album) and “Moving Pictures” are both crowd-movers, which manage to retain the experimental edge that defines the Stepkids’ music, packed into potent pop. </p>
<p>The music here is as effervescent as ever, as befits a trio made up of former session musicians.  “The Lottery” provides a good example of how multi-faceted songs never become overstuffed-- it’s got everything from shimmering keyboards to a horn section on the chorus to a scratched-up vocal sample, but as each element is slotted into it’s own specific place in the song, the sound remains blissfully uncluttered.</p>
<p>The Stepkids’ white-boy soul could be seen as fitting well into a spate of recent pop albums that make use of an understated smoothness, but the bombast of the best songs on <i>Troubadour</i> excites in a way that the too-cool stylings of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17736-justin-timberlake-the-2020-experience/"" target=""_blank""><i>The 20/20 Experience</i></a> and <i>Blurred Lines </i>often fail to do<i>.</i> Like their soul-funk contemporaries, the Stepkids mine a polymathic knowledge of music, distill it into a variety of seemingly incompatible sounds and then filter those through a funkified, purple lens. It’s an adventurous, impressive display of instrumental can-do, a music nerd’s romp through high-fidelity magic that’s only occasionally hampered by insipid writing.</p></div>"|18465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18465-the-stepkids-troubadour/|7.3|Jonah Bromwich

There is a bitter personal irony in the moment, a momentary affirmation of a fear that anyone chasing the culture industry contends with occasionally: I got here too late. Anything worth covering has already happened.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I don’t </span><span>really</span><span> feel that way, of course, but this quickie EP, dropped into the world two days ago, prompts bleak thoughts, at least while it’s on. It’s mercifully brief-- four songs, one, “Indie Cindy”, repeated in a “clean” version-- but considering it is the first new release bearing the Pixies name since 1991’s </span><i>Trompe Le Monde</i><span>, it leaves deep marks. Nothing in these four faceless, fatuous alt-rock songs distinguishes them as the music of the Pixies. Nothing, in fact, distinguishes them at all. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7231-kim-deal/"" target=""_blank"">Kim Deal</a> is absent, having left the band, but no one else-- not Santiago or Lovering or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/381-frank-black/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Black</a>-- seem to have shown up either.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>From the moment Black’s bleating vocal take begins on “Andro Queen”, it’s painfully clear: There is no Pixies in this Pixies. No tension between preschool giddiness and grad-school sophistication, between finger-painting pop and Bunuel-quoting lyrics; no seesaw between playfulness and menace;  no intimations of terror. There is no alien shimmer to the guitars or the vocal melodies. The cheerily plodding power chords and excruciating rhyme scheme of “Another Toe in the Ocean” recall </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8611-weezer-green-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>Green Album</i></a><span>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a>, or Lit. The turgid crunch of “What Goes Boom” summons uncomfortable memories of Papa Roach covering “Gouge Away”. This music wasn’t just written or recorded without any regard to the quality of the Pixies legacy, it was done so without regard to songwriting quality at all. If one of these songs had started playing over the credits of an </span><i>American Pie </i><span>knockoff that never reached theaters, you would not blink.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> For anyone with even a mild investment in the music the Pixies made in the 1980s-- which, considering how far their influence spread after Kurt Cobain leaked them into the world’s mainstream water supply, is a fair amount of people-- the utterly anonymous sound of </span><i>EP-1</i><span> is shocking. On “Indie Cindy”, Black rants and mutters lines like “You put the cock in cocktail, man/ I put the tail in </span><span>wait</span><span>, watch me walk."" It's terrible, but it's possibly the most memorable turn of phrase he manages. The rest streams by like multiplex air-conditioning.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's hard not to take the EP's failure personally. If not for the once-faraway promise of the Pixies, and bands like the Pixies, I would almost certainly never have wandered down the foolish siren-song path to music-critic employment in the first place. When I saw them play after they reunited, nine years ago, I distinctly remember the thrill, shared by the other twentysomethings around me, as we all sang along to “Hey”. This moment, maybe, wasn’t supposed to be. I was cheating death, or time, and like any good monkey’s-paw cautionary tale, it would certainly backfire in some way. And so it has. Very soon, no one will remember much about this EP, or that it even exists. But it’s a minor tragedy that it was released, and it’s almost enough to make me wish the reunion and even that magical show I saw never happened.</span></p></div>"|18560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18560-pixies-ep-1/|1.0|Jayson Greene

This much is true of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29711-chelsea-wolfe/"" target=""_blank"">Chelsea Wolfe</a>, an L.A. singer-songwriter whose records have synthesized doom folk, wasteland noise, and noirish experimentation. Wolfe's<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qjdo4yVv2I&amp;feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> 2010 cover of ""Black Spell of Destruction""</a> by black metal outfit Burzum may follow her forever. Her own music, though difficult to categorize, shares something essential with that genre. It's austere and atmospheric, expressed with the reverb through which Wolfe often pushes her voice; she's opened for extreme bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/620-boris/"" target=""_blank"">Boris</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a> and has cited Gorgoroth's ""Of Ice and Movement"" as a treasured song. Shortly after the Burzum cover came <a href=""http://whitehorse.bandcamp.com/track/hypnotize-ft-chelsea-wolfe"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">another one</a> that's gained less traction on the web: a surreal, pitch-shifted take on the 1997 Notorious B.I.G. classic ""Hypnotize"", found on a <a href=""http://whitehorse.bandcamp.com/album/pac-big"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collection of rap covers</a> from Ben Chisholm's ghostly <a href=""http://whitehorse.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Horse</a> project. Chisholm also happens to be Wolfe's bassist and co-producer on <i>Pain Is Beauty</i>, her best and most emotionally direct work yet.</p>
<p>There are no nods to hip-hop on <i>Pain</i>, but their exercise in booming, electronic, populist territory is telling. While 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15893-chelsea-wolfe-apokalypsis/"" target=""_blank""><i>Apokalypsis </i></a>and 2012's stark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17180-unknown-rooms-a-collection-of-acoustic-songs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Unknown Rooms</i></a> inched Wolfe closer to her melodic potential, they could only suggest the towering quality of this superseding new LP. At times <i>Apokalypsis </i>felt disguised in a permanent Halloween costume, a gothic nature fashioned so carefully as to induce skepticism. Her material had strong, original moments, but its overly witchy aura could distract; the veiled, candelabra-lit ""Mer"" video, though beautiful, edged toward self-parody. I wouldn't have been surprised to learn that Wolfe kept bats for pets or grew up with a cemetery in her backyard (the latter is actually true). Now, on <i>Pain Is Beauty</i>, we get a better sense of her talent and spirit.</p>
<p>Wolfe's songs of <i>Pain</i> emphasize massive builds with engulfing power in the vein of Swans. It's emotionally exhausting in equally mad and enjoyable ways, lasting nearly an hour across 12 twilight tracks of aggressive crescendos, poised reprieves, and suspended drama. The slower her metamorphosis, the heavier and more cavernous. As the record approaches its midway point, the ominous drones opening ""Sick"" signal the beginning of a wicked, cinematic patch. Wolfe has expressed interest in film soundtracks, and these songs, including ""Kings"" and ""Rein"", realize that ambition, building and swarming, creaking and pounding. They arrive at grim, seasick neo-folk balladry on ""They'll Clap When You're Gone"", which features some of Wolfe's most trudging and startling lyricism: ""Someone opened me up while I was sleeping/ Filled my body right up with sand,"" she sings. ""I carry a heaviness like a mountain."" The clarity of her songs can be terrifying.</p>
<p>These songs require more patience than <i>Pain</i>'s preceding, hook-driven opening, but the flood-tide dynamics remain-- the poppier songs are bleakly romantic, cheerlessly danceable, and equally all-consuming. The elegiac ""We Hit a Wall"" moves with a fierce march both funereal and inviting. The slyly anthemic ""House of Metal"" conjures the cool, emotional slink of dark Tri-Angle Records-style R&amp;B, while ""The Warden"" has a metallic, soft-sung coldwave feel that could appear on a Wierd Records compilation. ""Destruction Makes the World Burn Brighter"" has a warped, ominous 60s girl group sound-- upbeat Spector pop paired with thoroughly deranged lyrics, a could-be <i>Blue Velvet</i> soundtrack extra. </p>
<p>Wolfe's indecipherable vocals tend to forego a lyrical message for the sake of mood, but the sublimely intoxicating strength of her melodies carries weight. At times her voice recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Nadler</a>, a kindred spirit who similarly has connections to both folk and metal along with a shared pop touchstone in Joni Mitchell. Wolfe sings with conviction, grounded in themes of nature, ancestry, and tormented love. ""The Waves Have Come"", an epic, skin-crawling, eight-minute ballad with pierced high strings, is a journey of terror and sorrow and the record's most intense moment-- sung from the lovelorn perspective of a natural disaster survivor, inspired by the hugely fatal Japanese earthquake and tsunami two years ago.</p>
<p>A peculiar thing about Chelsea Wolfe and her cultural presence is how her cultish following is so disjointed-- she's popular among fans of extreme music, but also the fashion and art worlds, having repped designers like Alexander McQueen and Iris van Herpen, and <a href=""http://vimeo.com/24515353"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soundtracked</a> New York painter Richard Phillips' 2011 art film with Sasha Grey. And while there's something fascinating in how Wolfe attracts these crowds, she seems to exist alone in her own world on <i>Pain Is Beauty</i>, crystallizing and strengthening her musical language without compromising her original, principled vision. There's a propulsive quality to much of the beat-oriented <i>Pain</i>, but there remains a relative sense of privacy. It's hard to imagine Wolfe dancing to <i>Pain Is Beauty, </i>save for inside her own head.</p></div>"|18456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18456-chelsea-wolfe-pain-is-beauty/|8.0|Jenn Pelly

It's tempting to joke about his inevitable reggae album, but there's probably already one knocking around somewhere in his voluminous catalog, which runs to literally scores of solo albums and collaborations since 1990. There is, of course, his unmistakable voice, which suggests a sweeter and more gently deranged Jimmy Flemion (of shock-folk duo <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frogs_%28band%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Frogs</a>), especially when paired with a drugged-sounding acoustic guitar. There are his cryptic lyrics, those vague parables, like a less pithy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"">Bill Callahan</a>. And most of all, there's his knack for nudging apart any genre into his own personalized shape-- sparse and patient, with small gestures isolated and given room to breathe.</p>
<p>Following the ""haunted murk"" of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16206-amaranthine/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Amaranthine</i></a>, Youngs takes a drastic turn on <i>Summer Through My Mind</i>, an album of slightly unhinged but almost relentlessly tuneful Americana songs. Dominated by Youngs' vocals and guitar with a spooky banjo and some astringent harmonica, it falls on the most direct and accessible end of his output. The title track, a two-minute acoustic ditty, recalls early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided by Voices</a>, as does an even briefer sketch later in the album, especially with lyrics like ""Binary stars over Venice/ helicopters in chains,"" which sound ripped straight from the Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory. The erratically rising and falling electronic squeal in the background is harmonically destabilizing, representative of an album where rogue elements undermine traditional form until it implodes on ""Goodbye Oslo Rose"", an enigma in mottled harmonica and e-bowed guitar tones.</p>
<p>Among casual snippets such as ""Misjudgment"" and fleshed-out songs such as standout ""Mountain of Doom"", <i>Summer Through My Mind</i> is anchored by two big set-pieces, one that works great and one that will test the patience of any but the staunchest Youngs partisans. On ""Spin Me Endless in the Universe"", the revolving harmonies of Youngs' double-tracked voice, singing about superpowers, maintains momentum for over 11 minutes, especially with an expressive slide banjo offsetting the eternal arpeggios underpinning the vocals. ""The Story of Jhon"", on the other hand, stops the album's momentum dead in its tracks. Telling an inscrutable fable Youngs reportedly wrote as a child, about a seafaring boy's troubled relationship with his father, it features the Nebraskan singer/songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2212-simon-joyner/"">Simon Joyner</a>.</p>
<p>In a flat voice, Joyner recites a line; Youngs sings it back and strums desultory chords. This goes on for over 10 minutes, with the story developing but the lax music hardly changing except to fall further and further out of tune. Once you've heard the tale, it's difficult to imagine why you would return to it. But the indispensable quality of Richard Youngs is that he's willing to risk uncomfortable or baffling things to rearrange the usual partitions of song. The extended inertia of ""The Story of Jhon"" emphasizes how unique, how squirming with life, the more gracious and external songs surrounding it on <i>Summer Through My Mind</i> are.</p></div>"|18505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18505-richard-youngs-summer-on-my-mind/|6.8|Brian Howe

They’re not a musician’s main act, or, at the very least, they’re the <i>other</i> outlet that’s taking attention away from the reason we care about said musician in the first place. They’re a “project,” too, an experiment taken up with no certainty that the results will work or pay off or be worthy of elevating it to a “profession.” Side projects, though, often possess a clear <i>raison d’etre</i>-- a musician isn’t getting everything they need from the mothership, so they start a new group to provide that opportunity. There’s an idea behind the new band, then, a goal that’s approachable and often aided by their previous cumulative experience.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5938-the-howling-wind/"" target=""_blank"">The Howling Wind</a> is the black metal side project of multi-instrumentalist Ryan Lipynsky and drummer Tim Call, respective East Coast and West Coast metal musicians with exhaustive résumés. During the last two decades, Lipynsky has cycled through a series of related acts, from the black metal benders Thralldom and the futuristic sludge crew Unearthly Trance to the newly slow and brutal Serpentine Path. Thralldom’s best moments came when they treated black metal as a textural starting point and not a technical endgame, meaning Lipynsky has long worked for nearly 20 years in music that’s specialized in deliberate, tectonic quakes. Relatedly, Call seems to spend most of his time locked in distended doom epics; he toured as the drummer in Mournful Congregation earlier this year, plays with down-tuned Pacific Northwest outfit Shadow of the Torturer and powers the creeping majesty of Portland’s great, funereal Aldebaran. But as the Howling Wind, they’ve made four albums of knotty, atavistic black metal that’s shaken off the tempo torpor of their other outfits. But that’s not to say that they treat the imprint of their other acts as anathema; in fact, <i>Vortex</i>, their latest and fourth, succeeds because it weaves the touchstones of their résumés into these eight tracks very occasionally but very well, too.</p>
<p>The Howling Wind have long played fast and loose with the expectations of black metal: Though their 2007 debut <i>Pestilence &amp; Peril</i> mostly charged through distorted, deadpan heaviness, a labyrinth of dark industrial interludes suggested that Call and Lipynski were eager to break outside the bounds-- that’s where they came from, after all. But last year’s excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16999-of-babalon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Of Babalon </i></a>moved more toward firm rock'n'roll ground, with the hard-driving “Scaling the Walls” and the concise, swift beating of “Beast of the Sea” highlighting the differences between this and their other activities. To an extent, that still holds for <i>Vortex</i>, which casts the Howling Wind just as often as a malevolent rock band as black metal recreationists. “At the End of the Earth” suggests stoner rock with a sugar rush, with Lipynski’s tar-thick riffs pushed along by Call’s italicized beats. While “Alignment of Celestial Bodies” takes shape around several old-school black metal sequences; it tends to rumble along like Motörhead, too, with a mid-tempo chug functioning as the glue between its flickering leads and blast beats. Most notable, though, might be the searching, psychedelic solo at song’s end. The knot of notes is too colorful to be grim. It’s an a-ha moment for the band, proof positive of their broad interests.</p>
<p>That enthusiasm for pushing slightly but decidedly past the confines of the “black metal side project” mold keeps <i>Vortex</i> compelling and unstable. “Waves Come Crashing Down” begins as a blitz, with jagged riffs slicing through a relentless stomp. But an inexorable weight seems to linger from the outset, ultimately forcing the song into a slow-motion stagger, with Lipynski’s irascible tone stretched like scars over plodding drums. The two ride the groove together until the exit, the guitars decaying into a foreboding ellipsis. The patience necessary for their doom metal backgrounds shows up at the start of “Force of the Maelstrom”, which winds steadily upward from a long blues lead until, as the title suggests, the band hits high gear.</p>
<p><i>Vortex</i> both opens and ends with the sort of steely-eyed, solemn instrumentals as <i>Pestilence &amp; Peril</i>, with guitar whorls and electronic edits shaping a thick gray blanket. They are exactly the preludes and postludes that you might suspect from two doom dudes making a black metal record-- they’re interesting enough, but altogether expected. What’s unexpected, though, is how the Howling Wind has now turned the traces of its past and main outlets into a record that sounds less like a side project meant for producing black metal than a proper band free to do whatever it wants. </p></div>"|18462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18462-the-howling-wind-vortex/|7.5|Grayson Currin

When Jackson Fourgeaud released his 2005 debut album as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2246-jackson-and-his-computer-band/"" target=""_blank"">Jackson and His Computer Band</a> after years of prodigious singles and hot-stove development, it was a delirious tangle of ideas that just got messier the more you tried to pull it apart. It was an agile mixture of glitch, electro, left-field hip-hop and early French Touch that was less a blend than a collision. Everything sounded like a remix of a remix of a remix of a seventh draft, the odd paradox of something so fussed over that it shuddered into chaos as some kind of survival mechanism. Yet you could still move to it despite its apparent disinterest in locking into an easy-fit groove. That his public work post-<i>Smash</i> was limited to a string of remixes by electro/house acts that could be considered his less-outlandish usurprers-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"" target=""_blank"">Justice</a> (“D.A.N.C.E.”), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5245-kavinsky/"" target=""_blank"">Kavinsky</a> (“Pacific Coast Highway”), Planningtorock (“Living It Out”) -- seemed, for a while, like one of dance music's more perplexing mysteries. What the hell happened to him?</p>
<p>Eight years later, <i>Glow </i>retains the same question but shifts its target-- not to Jackson's absence, but to the diminishing returns he brought with him when that absence ended. If there's one overarching flaw to <i>Glow </i>that covers all the little accumulated ones, it's that Jackson's genre-pastiche seams are starting to show a bit more. Instead of hacking pieces away from a solid block of beats to create something jagged and slippery to grasp, he comes up with a riff or a figure-- something easily identifiable as neo-new wave or caricaturized electro or half-hearted gabber-- and scuffs the surface a bit so it looks dingy. Not enough to be challenging or do anything surprising with its corrosion, but enough that it makes it difficult for his production to breather.</p>
<p>Worse still, it feels like he's spent so much time pulling remix duty that he can only find ways to channel his own sound through other artists' work. “Orgysteria” and its cheesily grandiose android-love ooze is a few Hz short of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"" target=""_blank"">Air</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/80-10000-hz-legend/"" target=""_blank"">10,000</a>. “Dead Living Things” is the mushroomy analog sludge of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5277-black-moth-super-rainbow/"" target=""_blank"">Black Moth Super Rainbow</a> with an ill-advised <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/"" target=""_blank""><i>Random Access Memories </i></a>budget and a nasal falsetto whine that could use a dirtier filter or three. And the aluminum-rattling haunted house throb of “Pump” takes the <i>giallo</i> sensibilties of Justice's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10321-justice/"" target=""_blank""><i>†</i></a> and waters its art-horror aspirations down to third-rate direct-to-VHS splatter.</p>
<p>It gets worse. The unpleasant surprise of “G.I. Jane (Fill Me Up)”-- where gastric hoovers fill in for power chords, mock-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"">Phoenix</a> backbeats tick away rotely, and vocals are handled by a choir of distracted Mark Knopfler A.I.s-- doesn't work as either a sendup of arena indie or an embrace of it. And overdriven opener “Blow” and late-album churner “More” try to punk it up with quirky noise and noisy quirk, but can't stay focused long enough to keep their dopey momentum going before beatless interjections of droning synths let all the air out. Eclecticism and unpredictability used to be what made Jackson's work so exciting. But it's gotten so out of control that even the bits that almost work (“Seal” as bass-music flirtation; the swooning, dreamlike synthpop of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31080-classixx/"" target=""_blank"">Classixx</a>-ist “Vista”) still fail to come across integral threads in a new phase of his style. Instead, they feel like the pieces that stuck to the wall when he threw everything at it. I don't envy whoever has to clean up that mess.</p></div>"|18435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18435-jackson-and-his-computer-band-glow/|4.2|Nate Patrin

Case got her start playing drums in Vancouver punk bands. Then at some point, thankfully, someone convinced her that she could <i>sing. </i>Even italicized, that word feels inadequate to describe the meteorological event that takes place when Neko Case opens her mouth. Case has a moonbeam for a voice: imposing in timbre, opalescent in tone, and always surprising in its sheer force.</p>
<p>Case’s earliest records (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11628-the-virginianfurnace-room-lullabyblacklistedfox-confessor-brings-the-flood-bonus-disc-edition/"">the first two</a> were billed as Neko Case &amp; Her Boyfriends), were collections of country standards and spirited but generically twangy originals (representative title: ""Honky Tonk Hiccups""). But once she broke off on her own and started writing her own material, beginning with 2002’s bleakly stirring <i>Blacklisted</i><span>, two seemingly contradictory things happened. The first is that her music became increasingly more pop-oriented, owing in part to her collaborations with Canadian rockers the Sadies and a side gig as the resident siren in one of the best power-pop bands of the last decade, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26449-the-new-pornographers/"">New Pornographers</a>. The other is that her music became darkly, magnificently <i>weird</i>. All of Case’s subsequent solo records have a surreal, untamed quality about them, thanks to her unusual taste in protagonists (tornados, female prisoners, man-eating tigers) and the idiosyncratic grit of her songwriting voice. ""If I puked up some sonnets,"" she sings in one of the most quotable verses of her endlessly quotable new album, ""Would you call me a miracle?"" It’s a fair question, coming from an uncompromising artist whose career has unfurled like a sprawling, unruly piece of free verse.</span></p>
<p>After the release of her last record, 2009’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12729-middle-cyclone/"">Middle Cyclone</a></i>, though, Case weathered a rough patch. She lost her grandmother (with whom she was close), and then both of her parents (with whom she was not), and as a result-- something she’s begun to talk about in interviews for this record-- sunk into a depression. ""It was physically debilitating,"" she <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/23/neko-case-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>told <i>The Guardian</i></span></a> recently. ""You’re just in this murk. And you’re with other humans but you lose all your human skills and it’s just like you’re in this plastic bag and you can’t quite connect with people."" Case’s remarkable new album, <i>The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You</i> is an exorcism of this dark period of her life-- and also her most plainly autobiographical album yet. It is to Case’s discography what 2005's <i>The Sunset Tree</i> was to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/"">Mountain Goats</a>’: a seasoned songwriter known for evocative portraits of fictional characters finally turning that gimlet eye in on itself. The result is the most potent album of her career.</p>
<p><i>The Worse Things Get</i><span> is made of the same metal as </span><i>Middle Cyclone</i><span>, but fashioned into a much sharper object. The languid, mid-tempo ballads that occasionally made </span><i>Cyclone</i><span> sag have been replaced by songs that are shorter, tighter, and more cutting. Not a single one overstays its welcome, from the bracing, minimal self-help credo ""Afraid"" to the wistful ""Calling Cards"", a quietly devastating tale of long-suffering long-distance longing. ""We’ll all be together, even when we’re not together,"" Case's voice swells, finally landing on a bittersweet image that rings out long after the song fades: ""I’ve got calling cards from 20 years ago.""</span></p>
<p>The evolution between these two records is most striking, though, when the tempo revs up. When it first came out, the punchy lead-off single ""Man"" sounded like a retread of <i>Cyclone</i>’s caustically poppy ""People Got A Lotta Nerve"" (""I’m a man, man, man/ Man, man, man-eater""), but within the context of the record (or even more obviously, if you play the two back to back) the earlier song can’t hold a candle to it-- ""Man"" is bottled lightning. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"">M. Ward</a>’s buzzsaw lead guitar rages like a feral creature in a too-small cage, which, Case’s seething, unbridled vocal point out, is exactly what it feels like to be imprisoned in the impossible expectations of femininity. ""I’m a man/ That's what you raised me to be,"" she taunts like a shit-talking prizefighter. ""Fat-fingered bullies were no match for me/ I still taste them in my teeth.""</p>
<p>Case’s songs have long played fast and loose with gender roles and often star bold women (""We’ve got a lady pilot,"" she announced memorably on <i>Blacklisted</i><span>, ""Not afraid to die!""), but at the same time they reject simple, hollow </span><i>for-my-ladies</i><span> sloganeering in favor of more complicated truths. The “strong, independent woman” is a cliché that society often paints in black and white, but Case’s take on the subject is a portrait of innumerable grays. In a Neko Case song, freedom, strength and womanhood are all statements punctuated by question marks rather than exclamation points. But whenever </span><i>The Worse Things Get</i><span> risks getting too conceptual, a casual, mildly self-deprecating humor always brings these songs back down to earth. ""I was surprised when you called me a lady,"" she sings on ""I’m From No Where"", a subdued, acoustic comedown following ""Man"", ""'Cause I’m still not so sure that’s what I wanna be."" It might sound like a grand, abstract statement, but her logic's totally reasonable: ""I remember the 80s/ And I remember its puffy sleeves.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s an emotionally wrenching record throughout, but </span><i>The Worse Things Get</i><span> is at its most devastating when it takes up motherhood. Animated by rattling percussion and an arrangement that chatters like a dense forest, the opener ""Wild Creatures"" has an intrepid air about it (""I’m not fighting for your freedom/ I am fighting to be wild"") until it ends on a minor-key revelation: ""There’s no mother’s hands to quiet me."" This particular absence hovers constantly in the ether of </span><i>The Worse Things Get</i><span>, until it finally bubbles over on the stunning a capella centerpiece ""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu"". It’s a bold move and perhaps the most polarizing song she’s ever released; Case usually dresses her subjects up in magical realism and poetic turns of phrase, but she’s never worn her heart on her sleeve as plainly as she does here. The song tells the story of a mother Case saw screaming at a child in an airport in Hawaii-- ""Get the fuck away from me!/ Why don’t you ever shut up?""-- and as she sings them she slathers the mother’s words in reverb, the echo poignantly suggesting ripple effects they’ll have on the kid’s psyche. ""Honolulu"" hits like a shot to the gut. Case writes the song as an open letter to the neglected child (""Don’t you ever shut up, kid/ Please have your say"") and amidst the arrangement’s negative space, her voice is a thick blanket in the shivering cold.</span></p>
<p>And that’s the most impressive thing about <i>The Worse Things Get</i><span>: though it’s a record that looks at topics like depression and parental neglect square in the teeth, its overall tone is one of resilience. The penultimate track, ""Where Did I Leave That Fire"" begins with a sparse, post-rock arrangement but eventually gathers into a triumphant and surprisingly comic midtempo ballad about mojo returned. But the true victory lap is ""Ragtime"", a rousing blast of ""Crimson and Clover""-esque pop that serves up hard-won hope and plenty of mantras for carrying on. ""I’ll reveal myself invincible soon,"" Case sings, as a parade’s worth of brass swells around her in agreement.</span></p>
<p>Somehow, <i>The Worse Things Get</i> is Case’s tightest record and also her strangest. With its off-kilter arrangements and eccentric turns of phrase, it’s a world unto itself. If it has any contemporaries, they’re records like Fiona Apple’s <i>The Idler Wheel</i>… or Cat Power’s <i>Sun</i>-- the works of artists for whom “maturity” has not meant putting out that fire that Case sings so evocatively about chasing. </p></div>"|18451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18451-neko-case-the-worse-things-get-the-harder-i-fight/|8.2|Lindsay Zoladz

But the moment has recently intensified. After a steady drip of histories and love-notes to the genre-- plus the de facto canonization that time and increased press mentions bring-- comes a primary resource: this year’s <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Riot-Grrrl-Collection-Lisa-Darms/dp/1558618228"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Riot Grrrl Collection</i></a>, an anthology of zines, many obscure, from New York University’s Fales collection and bandmate donations. There's also a touring film, Sini Anderson’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna </a>documentary <i>The Punk Singer </i>(not even the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"" target=""_blank"">Bikini Kill</a> documentary), which dazzled SXSW last March. And then there's the extramusical zeitgeist, the seemingly weekly spurts of feminist backlash and backlash-to-the-backlash, the nostalgia-industrial complex that’s got everyone loving everything 1990s, and the Russian band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30623-pussy-riot/"" target=""_blank"">Pussy Riot</a> putting their forebears back into the headlines by becoming a cause célèbre‎. </p>
<p>What there hasn’t been is <i>new </i>music from Hanna, the person at the nucleus of it all. There’s a reason for that: She was diagnosed with long-progressed Lyme disease, which curtailed most work beyond archiving her older material-- the anthology, the old Bikini Kill albums, re-released last year-- and, by extension, her legacy. “Cookie Road”, the lead track from <i>Run Fast</i>, the new album from Hanna’s project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3614-julie-ruin/"" target=""_blank"">the Julie Ruin</a>, reads less like a “comeback” and more like a who’s who: Bikini Killing by Hanna, Kathi Wilcox, and new members Carmine Covelli and Sara Landeau, synth squiggles straight from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2438-le-tigre/"" target=""_blank"">Le Tigre</a>, a scatter of cabaret piano from Kenny Mellman of blowsy drag duo Kiki &amp; Herb, all storming the album one after the other like a particularly brisk overture and a rowdy encore in one. To call it “invigorated” would be missing the hyperkinetic point. Add one more member, too: Julie Ruin, the name Hanna took for her somewhat overlooked 1997 solo album. For a defiantly lo-fi project, <i>Julie Ruin</i> had aspirations-- tracks like “Apt. #5” and “My Morning Is Summer” contained the subtle swagger of songs built with enough space to be 10 times larger potentially. <i>Run Fast</i> is that album, to a point.</p>
<p>This is the sound of musicians confident in their legacy and what they can do with it. Parts of it sound like Hanna and company fleshing out the skeletons on <i>Julie</i> Ruin while keeping its samples and experiments: the title track, which is like that 10-times-bigger song realized with 15 years’ gravitas; politely catchy “Goodnight Goodbye”, full of easygoing riffs, marimba sugarcubes, and a core of existential dread to each and every one; the far less fraught “Girls Like Us”, which relaxes atop a “Let the Music Play” synth shimmer and lyrics (stuff girls do: use highlighter pens, have no creation myths, get over it) that practically come with 10,000 girls’ reblogs and doodled cosigns, even if some (""girls like us invented jazz"") might be a tad more embattled.</p>
<p>The bulk of it, though, is more disjointed. That's not always a bad thing-- it keeps the band from being an easy tour-circuit rehash, which by now would be entirely possible-- and part of it's Mellman's influence. He contributes vocals and songwriting to much of <i>Run Fast </i>(particularly half-shouted “South Coast Plaza”, which works both as a nostalgic summer jam and manic takedown of nostalgic summer jams), and a lot of the influences here sound like a quick tour through Kiki &amp; Herb’s formidable list of covers. But others aren't new sounds so much as loose ends-- ""Right Home"", a party track without the story, which makes sense enough in the story but less as a track, or ""Lookout"", a breather that's inexplicably the second on the album. They come and go, but you can pinpoint their origins a little too neatly.</p>
<p>Sometimes that works. ""Ha Ha Ha” is the single it’s hard to imagine Le Tigre actually ever recording this many years into the game, buzzy synths, handclaps, and plenty of words to yell upon other words (“just like Jim Jones was charismatic, you spend your life like an acrobatic!”). And naturally there are a few Bikini Kill singles that could have been: “Stop Stop” and “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15580-julie-ruin-oh-come-on/"">Oh Come On</a>” are as raucous as anything that group ever recorded, if a little bit at a remove; when Hanna says “sing it on the beat in the <i>new </i>girl style!” the nod’s so overt that you can’t help but notice what she added. </p>
<p>She’s still singing for girls, but different sorts of girls: the girl she was, the girls who are now who she was, who are kindred but unknowable; girls facing mortality, after which “girls” isn’t quite the right word. Those are the girls of ""Kids in NY"", simultaneously a recognition and a gentle satire (it's a duet, and Mellman plays the role of course-corrector: ""There's still a lot to say!""). She’s still writing lyrics to shout back, but there are bitter undertones; the passage of time comes up on more than one occasion, and when she sings “I don’t want to sit around and cry and whine” on “Party City”-- practically a shout-along conga-- she means euthanasia. (It's a reading few of these songs go out of their way to avoid; it's there, in other words.) If it’s the precise opposite of the mood of “Cookie Road,” it still sounds like a victory lap.</p></div>"|18415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18415-julie-ruin-run-fast/|7.0|Katherine St. Asaph

Along with adopting all of those paisley clothes and groovy organ sounds, the polarizing psych-pop duo even conforms to the era’s compressed sense of time. Similar to how the Beatles and the Rolling Stones released new albums every six months, and went through full-scale musical transformations pretty much every other year, Foxygen has already endured a career’s worth of ups and downs since the release of 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16869-take-the-kids-off-broadway/"" target=""_blank""><i>Take the Kids Off Broadway </i></a>EP.

As if that wasn’t enough activity, Rado is already working on his second solo LP, even as Foxygen’s handlers insist that the group isn’t falling apart. It might be a good idea to keep eyes peeled on L.A.-area rooftops for an impromptu farewell concert, just in case.</p>
<p>No matter what lies ahead in Foxygen’s future, <i>Law &amp; Order </i>suggests that Rado is fully prepared to make Foxygen records on his own. As a singer, he’s not as dynamic as Sam France, whose ability to ape various 60s icons-- Jagger, Lennon, and Barrett are his main touchstones-- adds extra authenticity to the group’s studious genre exercises. Rado’s vocals, meanwhile, are serviceable though not exactly essential, which might explain why he often buries them in effects (like on the demented late-night soul ballad “Looking 4a Girl Like U”) and abrasive guitar fuzz (on the clanking garage-rocker “I Wood”), or removes them completely (on the swinging Booker T. and the MGs homage “Dance Away Your Ego”).</p>
<p>Rado didn’t set out to make a record as pristine as <i>We Are the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Ambassadors</i>; <i>Law &amp; Order </i>is a homemade grab-bag of jams and rough-cut gems that sounds like it was hashed out in a matter of days. It’s basically Rado's version of <i>McCartney, </i>which is one among approximately 83 classic-rock references on <i>Law &amp; Order </i>smothered in the requisite air quotes.</p>
<p>Rado might be derivative, but at least there’s an admirable consistency to his prodigious output. Studying the masters has taught him how to put together catchy songs seemingly at will. The best tracks on <i>Law &amp; Order </i>are frontloaded: The album-opening “Seven Horses” blobs along on a trippy groove that’s surprisingly funky, and “Hand in Mine” is an enjoyable callback to the sexy camp of those old Lee Hazelwood/Nancy Sinatra duets. Things get weirder in the album’s second half-- “I Wanna Feel It Now!!!” recalls the thrilling cacophony of <i>Broadway-- </i>but the glitchy closer “Pot of Gold” is Rado’s most focused pop song yet. He even indulges in a slick yacht-rock guitar solo-- is this a sign that he’s moving on to the 70s, as all 60s heroes must eventually do? Knowing Rado, the wait won’t be long to find out.</p></div>"|18436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18436-jonathan-rado-law-and-order/|6.2|Steven Hyden

Not just because he’s been at this racket-making racket for over 15 years now, but because his current outfit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, has hit an oxymoronic equilibrium of garage-barf refinement-- a stable instability that only comes from grooming chaos as if it were your own child. In that sense, Dwyer couldn’t be prouder. The pride has led to the re-release of one of the stray wastrels of Dwyer’s back catalog: <i>Hands on the Controls</i>, the 2002 debut album by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/939-coachwhips/"" target=""_blank"">Coachwhips</a>, his band immediately prior to Thee Oh Sees. The band lasted from 2001 to 2005, and in that time Dwyer grew in leaps in bounds from the noisenik animatronics of Pink and Brown and toward the cracked-skull songcraft of Thee Oh Sees.</p>
<p><i>Hands on the Controls </i>was never issued on vinyl-- ironically, one of the greatest nil-fi recordings of the 00s only came out on CD-- but that’s being remedied now. Along with the sympathetic format comes six unreleased tracks laid down during the 2001 recording session that birthed<i> Hands on the Controls</i>. Twenty-five songs total seems a remarkable achievement for a two-day studio spurt, until you realize just how spastically these tracks came into being. More like shards of shattered glass than songs, “Wheelchair” and “That Bitch Is Gonna End Up Dead” draw blood as they drag themselves across the disc in minute-and-a-half slashes of minimal blues-punk that makes most minimal blues-punk sound like Wagner.</p>
<p>But there’s more to the mix than simply updating what Supercharger and the Spaceshits had done in the 90s. This was 2001, and viewed in that context, Dwyer-- and <i>Hands on the Controls </i>in particular-- could be seen as an emergency retoxification of garage rock in the wake of the Strokes and the White Stripes. Not that Coachwhips seemed to give a shit. But that was the point. The thought-blotting saxophone and fuzz-fried vocals of “These Things Belong to Someone Else” might as well have been a reclamation of the rudiments of caveperson primitivism. And they still could be.</p>
<p>Context aside, there’s a moronic, monomaniacal joy to <i>Hands on the Controls</i> that pushes it to the precipice of timelessness. This is a party in a studio with the tape rolling, no doubt about it, with all the in-jokes and wall-climbing that entails. “Mary Ann’s gonna sit this one out, ’cause this songs about her. [Belch.] ‘Mary Ann’,” is how Dwyer starts out the song “Mary Ann”, referring to the group’s organist Mary Ann McNamara. What follows is 59 seconds of the same numbskull riff played like a locked groove at the end of a Troggs 45. Dwyer’s only lyric: “Mary Ann”. Then it just stops, a love song yanked from the turntable. Later he begins “Wite Lites” by calling out, “John Harlow on drums!”-- as if the beat Harlow lays down was something more dazzling than what a food processor might have accomplished.</p>
<p>Those shout-outs, weird starts, loose threads, and dead ends are what make <i>Hands on the Controls </i>far more than the sum of its shrapnel. Of the previously unreleased tracks, “American and Europe Too” is the best premonition of what Dwyer would go on to do in Thee Oh Sees: pull together all these fragments of half-forgotten influences just long enough to take a blurry snapshot. It may be no coincidence that many of the six added tracks are among the heaviest and most pummeling of the repackaged <i>Hands</i>; “Not Gonna Make it Thru the Night” feels more like a still-steaming leftover from Pink and Brown, rather than the juicier, catchier nuggets that Dwyer would eventually start digging up. As a document of a chaos system in motion, <i>Hands on the Controls</i> is breathtaking; as a showcase for Dwyer’s emerging slop-psyche magnificence, it couldn’t sound more frighteningly vital.</p></div>"|18445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18445-coachwhips-hands-on-the-controls/|7.9|Jason Heller

Though they went through a minor lineup shuffle in between incarnations, it’d be glib to see it as a new start: Pink Frost still play Apteka songs in concert, and <i>Sundowning </i>is built from the same sludgy, earthen stuff that won them local acclaim. That said, while Apteka lumbered with monolithic gravitas built on layer after layer of droning guitar, Pink Frost have dialed it back a notch, writing songs you can almost imagine hearing on rock radio.</p>
<p>If indulging in their weirder side would’ve made them a natural fit for the stable of noisy bands that have sprung up in Chicago, Pink Frost have sharply pivoted away from DIY spaces and toward Ticketmaster-approved venues. Writing about “Ruins”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15725-pink-frost-ruins/"">Pitchfork’s Ian Cohen</a> compared Pink Frost to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"" target=""_blank"">Smashing Pumpkins</a>, which feels instinctively correct given their mutual Midwestern roots. There’s sonic common ground between <i>Sundowning </i>and early Pumpkins, most of it good assuming you don’t use “alt rock” as a pejorative. Lukas’ voice is more barking preacher than strictured choir boy, but he’s similarly capable of pairing yearning sentiment with big, bludgeoning riffs. “The Difference” evokes tender images of backlit cities and fractured feelings (“Hearts beat in the distance/ Until you witness the quickness/ and what’s left but the difference / Repeating sequence of sequins”) before aiming ascendent, and there’s a glow within the soaring thrash of “Ruins” that slips out like light through a cracked vase as Lukas sings about a love that’s worn and weathered but still standing. <i>Sundowning </i>is filled with quickly paced axe theatrics, but the band can be less direct, too: On “Who I Belong To”, listen for the guitar line that veins off from the main melody, wandering as the remaining parts swell toward a luminescent outro that never meanders. </p>
<p>You sense this is an act that sounds heftiest in person or at a volume that begs a police report. Heavy times aren’t created equally, and the line between bitchin’ and butt rock is different for every band that’s decided their best plan of attack is to keep on attacking. If <i>Sundowning </i>ever feels staid, it’s when the band spends a little too long hammering a single progression. “Occupy Within” and “Dead Cities” don’t get weird enough to justify the formulaic arrangements that might bring uncharitable comparisons to, say, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQBNH3UFEC0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Disturbed</a>. By contrast, the moments where they find the balance are sublime, like when the gnarled freakout of “Western Child” suddenly yawns into a staticky, swirling drone before collapsing back into itself. It’s not powerfully original, but it is powerful. Another name change would justify a further refining, but Pink Frost appear to have found a home in the middle. </p></div>"|18466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18466-pink-frost-sundowning/|6.8|Jeremy Gordon

But almost no one interprets it as “fun.” Now consider Wisconsin experimental post-rock outfits <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5703-collections-of-colonies-of-bees"">Collections of Colonies of Bees</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29168-all-tiny-creatures"">All Tiny Creatures</a> and the fact that “experimental post-rock” never promises a load of laughs either. These are the parties that comprise <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27996-volcano-choir"">Volcano Choir</a> and on their second LP <i>Repave</i>, the sextet have created a grandiose record with arena-rock ambitions and ostentatious beauty that is mostly inscrutable on a lyrical level. And yet, here’s the way in: I think this is the sound of them having fun.</p>
<p>This may sound counterintuitive, but it was also the key to unlocking their 2009 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13506-unmap/""><i>Unmap</i></a>. Lyrics such as “conserve it with an omelette/ and you’re on it with the carpet” from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11448-island-is/"">“Island, IS”</a> would’ve been a dead giveaway if you could make them out in the slightest. But while all those beatless, free-time <i>mbira</i> excursions could have been interpreted as experimental artists indulging their least accessible ideas, let’s not forget that thumb pianos are really fun to play when you’re stoned.</p>
<p><i>Repave</i> is a decidedly more extroverted affair-- “with enough kief/ you can really bore someone” is the most straightforward and sound advice you’ll get from Vernon, though he sings it with chesty zeal on “Byegone” like it’s a regal proclamation. Volcano Choir are less interested in getting high this time out as they are achieving spiritual uplift, or at least getting a rise out of the listener-- if you still are doubting the sincerity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/""><i>Bon Iver</i></a>’s Hornsby tribute “Beth/Rest”, <i>Repave</i> establishes that some things will never change with Vernon.</p>
<p>The near entirety of it could be described as “power balladry,” a comprehensive denomination that owes plenty to the 1980s’ most popular Bruces, but also those that stood at their periphery and the bands that would ultimately carry their lineage. Overdriven organ, booming drums, and Vernon’s multitracked falsetto push opener “Tiderays” to an elevated plane where post-prog Genesis and pre-Eno <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay"">Coldplay</a> meet. The magisterial orchestration of “Byegone” enrobes a grizzled folk tune; it’s a place where early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam"">Pearl Jam</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire"">Arcade Fire</a> find common ground in their ability to reconcile the supposed incongruity of humility and bluster within a cohesive aesthetic. Those bands tended to make songs with “sea” or “ocean” in their title and you don’t need that damn album cover for Volcano Choir to drive the point home. All songs on <i>Repave</i> begin quietly and almost none stay that way for long, so when those crescendos hit, you’re supposed to envision waves crashing on cold, barren outcroppings, white mist spraying as seabirds take majestic flight.</p>
<p>That’s really what “power ballad” means on a literal level-- an intimate song blown out to widescreen proportions to the point where you <i>have</i> to call it epic and it can be shared with thousands of people who all think it was written for <i>them</i>. It’s worth acknowledging the mutual benefit that gets passed on to CoCoB and ATC here: let’s not forget, for all the ill will directed towards any of the influences here, their records were often the outcome of the most technically proficient musicians on earth given frightening sums of money and unlimited studio time with the express purpose of making ""it sounds like a million bucks"" feel tangible.</p>
<p>And the instrumental contingent of Volcano Choir gets to live out their hockey shed visions by isolating the most bombastic sections of Bon Iver albums and making entire songs out of them. They still fill out the margins playing tricky, off-kilter guitar lines that wouldn’t be out of place in their own work. Here, they’re polished, shellacked, and gilded to the point where you couldn’t imagine Vernon picking up one of their guitars and strumming out “Skinny Love”-- they sound more like harps. The depth of the drums evoke not just canyons and churches, but the Grand Canyon and Sistine Chapel. In short, <i>Repave</i> sounds amazing, almost intimidating in its clarity, so even when “Keel” and ""Almanac"" start to integrate the more free-form and abrasive sounds of <i>Unmap</i> towards the end, you’re more likely to hear the spirituals of later Talk Talk than anything truly confrontational.</p>
<p>Still, they never overpower Vernon, who focuses solely on his vocals here and anthologizes every mode he’s been in for the past half decade. His most quoted line by now is “I was not magnificent,” and <i>Repave</i> answers “like hell I wasn’t.” A couple of my colleagues noted the influence of Bruce Springsteen on this record, and while I concur, it’s more of a visual than a sound. On late-album lighter-waver “Alaskans”, you can sense a perspirant Vernon two hours into a cathartic, marathon show, toweling himself down, sitting at a piano bench. There’s a performative edge that might seem out of place in Bon Iver-- even though the band’s personnel exploded to over a dozen, you still have the expectation that Vernon’s singing his pain up there. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9202-volcano-choir/"">As he explained to Ryan Dombal</a>, Volcano Choir doesn’t just sound romantic or like make-out music, it’s distinctly sexual. When he sings ""We're talkin’ real love” in a seductive lower register on “Alaskans”, it’s like the drums were removed so you can hear the adulation of the crowd in your mind. Vernon howls “I won’t beg for you on acetate” and it’s a knowing, self-referential barb from a guy whose music often gets characterized as doing just the opposite.</p>
<p>What Volcano Choir get out of this is the ability to indulge in extravagant power balladry without taking on the seemingly requisite overblown persona where all this heavy lifting is necessary when you're carrying the weight of the world. But just as often, the subtle levity gets a little too heightened. Had Vernon done away with lyrics completely and gone Wisconsin Hopelandic on us, <i>Repave</i> might be worthy of being called the third Bon Iver album, which it sorta is-- the majestic choruses of “Tiderays” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15880-comrade/"">“Comrade”</a> are way more in line with <i>Bon Iver</i>’s “Perth” or “Calgary” than anything on <i>Unmap</i>. But too often, Vernon’s lyrics range from puzzling to utterly too goofy to ignore, creating a discomfiting dissonance with the stone cold sobriety of the music.</p>
<p>Authenticity is always something of a bugaboo outside of Vernon’s main gig-- you use <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/""><i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i> </a>and <i>Bon Iver</i> as standards and everything’s going to sound potentially insincere by comparison. Usually, skepticism is succesfully met head on-- the louche and lewd nature of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs"">Gayngs</a> assured that while they weren’t winking, they were definitely leering. As far as the blue-collar, cheesehead rawk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31251-the-shouting-matches"">Shouting Matches</a>, the whole point is to remind you that Vernon is a Wisconsinite from Eau Claire, not just a dude who happened upon a cabin there. For all I know, Vernon might be entering his Ghostface Killah ca. <i>Supreme Clientele</i> phase-- simply toying with words for maximum surrealistic value. But while <i>Repave's </i>sounds trigger skygazing, googly-eyed emotion, lines like ""tossin' off your compliments, wow/ sexin' all your Parliaments"" and ""that Ticonderoga shit/ made my mind and my heart/ all split up over/ the floor of the jackpot"" can make you immediately question how much you should trust them.</p>
<p>Vernon explained <i>Repave's </i>carnality<i> </i>as damn near necessary in the indie rock discussion: ""It's been built up so hard and so high that people are afraid...I'm talking about how what happens between people is so misunderstood even between the people who are having sex. Maybe some of the lyrics on this record are my way of cracking the egg."" It's a noble cause, but indicative of the obfuscation and loopiness that undermines <i>Repave;</i> he uses a mixed metaphor to describe what might happen if people <i>discuss </i>the emotions that result from a physical act. But in the way its tremendously seductive and overwhelming overtures can be jeopardized by one embarrassing line or wrong move, <i>Repave </i>does become a realistically sexualized record. Just not exactly in the way it intended.<span id=""docs-internal-guid-500e0e22-c829-b52d-fd6c-d15c8464b26b""><br/></span></p></div>"|18447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18447-volcano-choir-repave/|7.8|Ian Cohen

For all the voodoo mystique and sex-machine swagger he wields onstage, his songs brim with anxiety and humility, whether he’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDmbY9GDpno"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lusting after cute record-store clerks</a>, professing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI2MxZmj-6A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his weakness for plus-size paramours</a>, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiTN-ss9GZA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">measuring his commitment in food stamps</a>. It’s the sort of charm offensive that comes naturally when-- as a brown man in the traditionally white world of garage-punk, not to mention in Khan’s adopted hometown of Berlin-- you’ve lived your life as an outsider among outsiders. But in the six years that have passed since he and his band the Shrines last released a new album, Khan’s sassy self-deprecation has turned to sobering introspection, and for good reason. He’s endured the death of three close friends (including punk-rock pal Jay Reatard), and a reportedly nasty falling-out with long-time collaborator Mark “BBQ” Sultan (his frequent partner in crime since their late-90s tenure in Montreal’s the Spaceshits); the cumulative effect of all this turmoil saw Khan seeking solace in psychiatric hospitals and Buddhist monasteries alike. If his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15980-the-king-khan-experience-scion-av-presents-the-king-khan-experience/"">2011 solo release</a> for Scion’s A/V series-- released under the ad-hoc King Khan Experience banner-- sounded like a mess, that’s because, well, at the time, he felt like one. </p>
<p>But if you need any proof that Khan is back to fighting trim, just look at the spine of his latest record, which bears not only the imprimatur of the Shrines-- the band that brings out the show-bizzy best in him-- but the logo of his first proper U.S. label: Merge Records. (Khan’s 2008 Vice Records issue, <i>The Supreme Genius of King Khan and The Shrines</i> was a compilation culled from various European releases.) Khan’s work with the Shrines has typically drawn from the funk, psych, and soul of the turn-of-the-’70s black-power era, but seemingly had little use for its ideological intent. <i>Idle No More</i>, however, takes an inverse approach: its fusion of Brian Jones-era Rolling Stones paisley pop and Spectorian pomp pushes Khan and the Shrines beyond their usual JBs jones, but the album’s title speaks to a burgeoning social consciousness. It’s named for an emergent Canadian Aboriginal-rights protest movement, one Khan particularly identifies with after spending his teen years hanging on reservations in Quebec with a Mohawk friend (one of the aforementioned casualties). Though there’s not a single song here that explicitly addresses the plight of First Nations people, Khan has essentially donated his album title to the cause as if it were an advertising billboard-- the first indication of the album’s more sanguine, openhearted spirit.</p>
<p>Even in the absence of any overt political sloganeering, Khan evinces a new sense of purpose here. The album’s first side counts as the most majestic music the King has produced, blowing up his garage-rock roots to a cinematic scale without losing the ballsy attitude. The Shrines bring the brass, of course, but this time they’re bolstered by sweeping strings and ba-ba-da-ba choruses that transform songs like “Born to Die” and “Thorn in Her Pride” into the stuff glitzy 60s prime-time variety specials were made of. But the more opulent environs don’t dilute Khan’s finely tuned sense of irreverence: When he cops Lou Reed’s “and all the colored girls sing” directive prior to the latter songs’ “shoobie-doo-wop” finale, it becomes immediately clear he doesn’t have the budget to hire an actual troupe of back-up singers, so he just pitches his voice up and sings the hook himself. “Luckiest Man”, meanwhile, is a cheeky account of his soul-searching sojourn and recovery set to the buoyant groove of Archie Bell &amp; the Drells’ northern-soul classic “Tighten Up”. But even when there’s a lightness and congeniality to the songs that Khan has rarely evinced before, the Shrines’ big-band effect lends them an imposing wall-of-sound grandeur and fierce Motown momentum.</p>
<p>That is, until the brooding ballad “Darkness” brings the album’s vigorous pace to a screeching halt. A dark-soul-of-the-night document of his recent breakdown, it should be Khan’s “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World”, a slow-burning, show-stopping set piece that prompts the singer to his knees and bring the house down with him. Instead, he opts for a campy, drag-queen croon that saps the song of its emotional impact by constantly drawing attention to how far Khan is singing outside of his usual raspy range. From there, <i>Idle No More</i> never fully regains its footing, as the album tries to balance deeply personal subject matter and the Shrines’ party-hearty energy with inconsistent results: “Pray for Lil” (featuring a beautifully yearning guest lead vocal from Jena Roker) is a winsome tribute to Khan’s wife and the support she provided in his hour of need, but the songs dedicated to late Atlanta garage-scene fixture Bobby Ubangi (“Bad Boy”) and Reatard (“So Wild”) feel a touch too slight and undercooked, given their inspirations. However, the closing Hendrixian ballad “Of Madness I Dream”, peacefully reconciles <i>Idle No More</i>’s overarching themes of remorse and renewal--for King Khan, the premise of mourning and the promise of morning are one and the same. </p></div>"|18448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18448-king-khan-and-the-shrines-idle-no-more/|6.8|Stuart Berman

He was a real nice little guy, didn’t have a whole lot to say.” So remembers Bob Priest in the 2005 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1356-roky-erickson/"" target=""_blank"">Roky Erickson</a> documentary, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791268/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>You’re Gonna Miss Me</i></a>. According to Priest-- a psychiatrist at the maximum-security mental institution Rusk State Hospital in East Texas during Roky Erickson’s imprisonment there in the late 60s and early 70s-- writing music is what kept Erickson going during those horrifying years of compulsory electroshock therapy and Thorazine doses: “He wanted to write his music, and he wanted to play his music. And that’s all. At least it took his mind off where he was.”</p>
<p>The legend of Roky Erickson is one of the most compelling in rock history. As the leader of the 13th Floor Elevators, he codified 60s psychedelia-- helping establish the genre’s American vernacular, distinct from the prim <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>-isms of its British counterpart. Even further, the native Texan staked out a parochial claim on druggy, transcendental rock that was fuzzier and more deeply fried than the West Coast’s more cultured iteration. Regardless of geography, it was clear Erickson claimed citizenship in one place and one place only: his own head. At Rusk, he was forced to explore-- or retreat into-- previously uncharted fringes of that psychic territory. There he peered inward, hummed to himself, and wrote. And when he was released in 1974, he took that yellow legal pad and set about making those visions real.</p>
<p>Fits and false starts later, <i>The Evil One</i> was made manifest. Erickson’s official solo debut album, <i>I Think of Demons</i>, was released on CBS in 1980, but it was recorded concurrently-- by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8318-creedence-clearwater-revival/"" target=""_blank"">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>’s Stu Cook-- with the tracks that appear on <i>The Evil One</i>, which came out in 1981 after Erickson had been shunted to the Columbia-subsidized indie label 415. Erickson was just as out of place on a new-wave imprint as he was on a major. By then, he'd burned through a litany of sidemen and backing bands, not to mention a significant amount of momentum. Still his songs refused to trade in on the lingering glory of the Elevators or 60s nostalgia at large, hewing instead to a monster-movie fixation that-- at least in the arena where Erickson now found himself-- only the Misfits and the Damned might have been able to relate to. It was almost as if, after serving nearly four years in the mental institution at Rusk, he was being sentenced to another: punk.</p>
<p>Thanks to synchronicity, osmosis, or both, the punkness of <i>The Evil One</i> is one of its great strengths. Played by his new band the Aliens, “Two Headed Dog” and “Bloody Hammer” pump and slam with a stiff, chiseled precision that couldn’t be further from the Elevators’ shimmering multi-dimensionality. Then again, Erickson is a fucking monster-- one who sings about monsters. In a spasms of feral, lip-twisted fury, he snarls about demons, zombies, vampires, ghosts, and demons again with all the intensity of a rabies victim. That said, the album has just as much in common with the progressive, sci-fi-obsessed hard rock of Blue Öyster Cult-- or the lurid phantasmagoria of Alice Cooper, minus the camp-- as it does with punk.</p>
<p>The<i> </i>best-known track on <i>The Evil One</i>, “I Walked With a Zombie”, neatly pinpoints Erickson’s perception of rock'n'roll circa 1980. It’s batshit-- but in the most composed way, possessing the kind of coherent, clear-eyed, convinced-of-its-own-sanity insanity that makes the blood of the observer run cold. Zombies it is, then, as Erickson draws on (or gives in to) his preoccupation with George Romero’s <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> and the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby”-- decades before those signifiers would become self-consciously cool again. There’s also something eerily Television-like about the oscillating, icicle guitars and the emotionless petrification of Erickson’s voice. He may have, as he sings, “walked with a zombie last night”-- but the zombie probably had more to fear than Erickson did.</p>
<p><i>The Evil One</i> is getting a fresh coat of paint as part of a trifecta of Erickson reissues, the other two being <i>Don’t Slander Me</i> and <i>Gremlins Have Pictures</i>, both from 1986. Their genius is less feverish, but only by a few degrees. Originally released on the retro-garage label Pink Dust, Erickson was now being lumped in with the pointy-booted likes of Plan 9 and Plasticland-- not to mention a forward-looking new psychedelic outfit called the Flaming Lips, whose Pink Dust debut <i>Hear It Is</i> also came out in 86. Perversely, <i>Don’t Slander Me</i> has more in common with early Lips than with the retro-60s acts; predictably, it still sounds like no one but Erickson.</p>
<p>If Erickson’s schizophrenic paranoia was on the rise-- at the time he was fanatically obsessed with finding messages in random pieces of mail, leading to his arrest in 1989 for mail theft-- his music didn’t show it. The Aliens now gone, he led his new outfit the Explosives through a lean, sinewy batch of songs that display Erickson at his most lucid and direct. True, he sings about “false gods” and “devils” on the album’s title track, but the song also ditches the hard-rock sheen of <i>The Evil One</i> in favor of souped-up garage rock. Erickson sounds more at home in his skin, even as he sings far more prosaic lyrics about love and, well, the Bermuda Triangle. There’s even a lunge toward power-pop on the ringing, jangly “Starry Eyes” and the Buddy Holly-esque “You Drive Me Crazy”, which aches so sincerely for Erickson’s lost 60s that his “heart pounds suffocatingly loud.” And even when he laughs maniacally after singing “the candles in my candelabra burn hellishly” in “Burn the Flames”, it’s good, clean, Halloweenish fun.</p>
<p>The cleanliness and control of <i>Don’t Slander Me</i> makes for a more palatable but less vital Erickson. <i>Gremlins Have Pictures</i> has no such problem. Culled from a decade’s worth of live recordings and studio outtakes-- ranging from his first post-incarceration show in Austin in 1975 to his sessions for <i>Slander</i>-- <i>Gremlins</i> provides a candid peek under Erickson’s hood during his most potent years as a solo artist. Top to bottom, it’s a revelation. Songs that would later appear on <i>The Evil One</i>, including “Night of the Vampire” and “Cold Night for Alligators” (renamed “It’s a Cold Night for Alligators”), are rendered live, jagged, and unhinged enough for the chaos of Erickson’s subconscious to bleed through. And his pummeling cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>’s “Heroin” is so hoarse and harrowing, it gives new insight into the taken-for-granted original.</p>
<p>But it’s the acoustic material on <i>Gremlins Have Pictures</i> that truly stuns.

He was a real nice little guy, didn’t have a whole lot to say.” So remembers Bob Priest in the 2005 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1356-roky-erickson/"" target=""_blank"">Roky Erickson</a> documentary, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791268/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>You’re Gonna Miss Me</i></a>. According to Priest-- a psychiatrist at the maximum-security mental institution Rusk State Hospital in East Texas during Roky Erickson’s imprisonment there in the late 60s and early 70s-- writing music is what kept Erickson going during those horrifying years of compulsory electroshock therapy and Thorazine doses: “He wanted to write his music, and he wanted to play his music. And that’s all. At least it took his mind off where he was.”</p>
<p>The legend of Roky Erickson is one of the most compelling in rock history. As the leader of the 13th Floor Elevators, he codified 60s psychedelia-- helping establish the genre’s American vernacular, distinct from the prim <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>-isms of its British counterpart. Even further, the native Texan staked out a parochial claim on druggy, transcendental rock that was fuzzier and more deeply fried than the West Coast’s more cultured iteration. Regardless of geography, it was clear Erickson claimed citizenship in one place and one place only: his own head. At Rusk, he was forced to explore-- or retreat into-- previously uncharted fringes of that psychic territory. There he peered inward, hummed to himself, and wrote. And when he was released in 1974, he took that yellow legal pad and set about making those visions real.</p>
<p>Fits and false starts later, <i>The Evil One</i> was made manifest. Erickson’s official solo debut album, <i>I Think of Demons</i>, was released on CBS in 1980, but it was recorded concurrently-- by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8318-creedence-clearwater-revival/"" target=""_blank"">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>’s Stu Cook-- with the tracks that appear on <i>The Evil One</i>, which came out in 1981 after Erickson had been shunted to the Columbia-subsidized indie label 415. Erickson was just as out of place on a new-wave imprint as he was on a major. By then, he'd burned through a litany of sidemen and backing bands, not to mention a significant amount of momentum. Still his songs refused to trade in on the lingering glory of the Elevators or 60s nostalgia at large, hewing instead to a monster-movie fixation that-- at least in the arena where Erickson now found himself-- only the Misfits and the Damned might have been able to relate to. It was almost as if, after serving nearly four years in the mental institution at Rusk, he was being sentenced to another: punk.</p>
<p>Thanks to synchronicity, osmosis, or both, the punkness of <i>The Evil One</i> is one of its great strengths. Played by his new band the Aliens, “Two Headed Dog” and “Bloody Hammer” pump and slam with a stiff, chiseled precision that couldn’t be further from the Elevators’ shimmering multi-dimensionality. Then again, Erickson is a fucking monster-- one who sings about monsters. In a spasms of feral, lip-twisted fury, he snarls about demons, zombies, vampires, ghosts, and demons again with all the intensity of a rabies victim. That said, the album has just as much in common with the progressive, sci-fi-obsessed hard rock of Blue Öyster Cult-- or the lurid phantasmagoria of Alice Cooper, minus the camp-- as it does with punk.</p>
<p>The<i> </i>best-known track on <i>The Evil One</i>, “I Walked With a Zombie”, neatly pinpoints Erickson’s perception of rock'n'roll circa 1980. It’s batshit-- but in the most composed way, possessing the kind of coherent, clear-eyed, convinced-of-its-own-sanity insanity that makes the blood of the observer run cold. Zombies it is, then, as Erickson draws on (or gives in to) his preoccupation with George Romero’s <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> and the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby”-- decades before those signifiers would become self-consciously cool again. There’s also something eerily Television-like about the oscillating, icicle guitars and the emotionless petrification of Erickson’s voice. He may have, as he sings, “walked with a zombie last night”-- but the zombie probably had more to fear than Erickson did.</p>
<p><i>The Evil One</i> is getting a fresh coat of paint as part of a trifecta of Erickson reissues, the other two being <i>Don’t Slander Me</i> and <i>Gremlins Have Pictures</i>, both from 1986. Their genius is less feverish, but only by a few degrees. Originally released on the retro-garage label Pink Dust, Erickson was now being lumped in with the pointy-booted likes of Plan 9 and Plasticland-- not to mention a forward-looking new psychedelic outfit called the Flaming Lips, whose Pink Dust debut <i>Hear It Is</i> also came out in 86. Perversely, <i>Don’t Slander Me</i> has more in common with early Lips than with the retro-60s acts; predictably, it still sounds like no one but Erickson.</p>
<p>If Erickson’s schizophrenic paranoia was on the rise-- at the time he was fanatically obsessed with finding messages in random pieces of mail, leading to his arrest in 1989 for mail theft-- his music didn’t show it. The Aliens now gone, he led his new outfit the Explosives through a lean, sinewy batch of songs that display Erickson at his most lucid and direct. True, he sings about “false gods” and “devils” on the album’s title track, but the song also ditches the hard-rock sheen of <i>The Evil One</i> in favor of souped-up garage rock. Erickson sounds more at home in his skin, even as he sings far more prosaic lyrics about love and, well, the Bermuda Triangle. There’s even a lunge toward power-pop on the ringing, jangly “Starry Eyes” and the Buddy Holly-esque “You Drive Me Crazy”, which aches so sincerely for Erickson’s lost 60s that his “heart pounds suffocatingly loud.” And even when he laughs maniacally after singing “the candles in my candelabra burn hellishly” in “Burn the Flames”, it’s good, clean, Halloweenish fun.</p>
<p>The cleanliness and control of <i>Don’t Slander Me</i> makes for a more palatable but less vital Erickson. <i>Gremlins Have Pictures</i> has no such problem. Culled from a decade’s worth of live recordings and studio outtakes-- ranging from his first post-incarceration show in Austin in 1975 to his sessions for <i>Slander</i>-- <i>Gremlins</i> provides a candid peek under Erickson’s hood during his most potent years as a solo artist. Top to bottom, it’s a revelation. Songs that would later appear on <i>The Evil One</i>, including “Night of the Vampire” and “Cold Night for Alligators” (renamed “It’s a Cold Night for Alligators”), are rendered live, jagged, and unhinged enough for the chaos of Erickson’s subconscious to bleed through. And his pummeling cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>’s “Heroin” is so hoarse and harrowing, it gives new insight into the taken-for-granted original.</p>
<p>But it’s the acoustic material on <i>Gremlins Have Pictures</i> that truly stuns. The queasy slide guitar on “I Am” removes any semblance of solid ground from Erickson’s hammering folk and Satanic sentiment; “Song to Abe Lincoln”, with its lo-fi sing-song and off-kilter shuffle, could pass for the Shaggs; “I Have Always Been Here Before” allows Erickson to extend his titular paradox into a skeletal meditation on memory-- both its contents and its malfunction.

Over the past decade, he has shrouded his abstract singer/songwriter music with vast, ominously serene arrangements. But no matter which way Buckner tacks, he always contrasts imagery so nonfigurative it seems shaped from vapor with tactile, oaken music. His deep-grained acoustic guitar playing is splintery as a raw plank. His voice is a long gnarled shape with a silky finish, like a sea-polished branch, and gives a roughshod impression that belies its smooth range and secure pitch. Its heaviness is most affecting when it floats vulnerably high to breathe out the merest hints of a narrative, as on ""Portrait"", one of many gorgeously charged songs on new discography highlight <i>Surrounded.     </i></p>
<p>As much as I love the Buckner of early classics such as ""Rainsquall"", where he beat up his guitar like it owed him money and sang as stridently as a car alarm, I prefer the oracular poise and oceanic atmosphere he cultivated during the mid 2000s on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1000-dents-and-shells/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dents and Shells</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9400-meadow/"" target=""_blank"">Meadow</a>. </i>That's probably why I didn't strongly connect with his arid 2011 comeback <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15700-our-blood/"" target=""_blank""><i>Our Blood</i></a>, which some regarded as a stripped-down return to form. But there were some concrete problems with it, too. Owing to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15700-our-blood/"">a series of misfortunes</a>, he remade the album twice, and you could tell: it felt threadbare, leached of inspiration. It's hard not to receive the lush, focused<i> Surrounded</i> as a correction. You can hear the difference as soon as you press play, with the title track's acoustic guitar dancing crisply in a full reflective cloud, languid high harmonies pouring over Buckner's dreamiest croon like honey.   </p>
<p>Buckner sent off his tracks for mixing to the ubiquitous Tucker Martine as soon as he finished them, to prevent loss and overthinking, and frequently bottled lightning. He used an electric autoharp and an octave pedal to create a stormy, bright-seamed sound profile for the album, with piercing melodies condensed out of dark, sliding layers of pulses and drones. The shaker percussion on the darkly coiled ""When You Tell Me How It Is"" comes back several times, reinforcing the general sense of something about to strike. ""Foundation"" sails majestically on sweet, choppy feedback, while the extraordinarily tense ""Mood"" rumbles on a deep, skipping howl. These are some of the boldest sounds he has ever put forward, and that's before you even get to ""Cut"", where the golden crests of his voice ride on what sounds like a sultry trance-gated organ.</p>
<p>As one-of-a-kind lyricists go, Buckner is the least quotable ever. He uses the plainest language to obscure rather than clarify, slowly unspooling long, slippery clauses that linger tantalizingly on the threshold of resolution.""It seems like you're there,"" he sings, ""as someone removed/ and left in their place/ with nothing to do."" There would be nothing exceptional about this careful, evocative blankness if he didn't maintain it over the course of the album. It feels like one large, refracted thought, always just out of focal range, which almost comes clear on the dusky and powerful conclusion ""Lean-To"", with its uncommonly sharp-edged images of dying stars breaking windows and bodies swinging from rafters in the dark.</p>
<p>The liner notes reveal that these lyrics are drawn from one continuous prose text; the most substantial foray into a mode Buckner previously explored on <i>Since</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/998-impasse/"" target=""_blank""><i>Impasse</i></a>. The printed lyrics are embedded with extra text in red, which alters the implications of the sung words. You can see how he freely breaks lines across sentences to add even more shades to his meaning-- which matters a lot when your meaning is nothing but shades. That sense of loaded omission that defines his lyrics is confidently placed on display, on a record marked by a revivified confidence. Buckner has long been a cherished cult object, fuelled by the devotion of the few (especially the ones at Merge who keep him afloat with that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a> war chest), but <i>Surrounded</i> is polished and persuasive enough that everyone should give it a try. </p></div>"|18437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18437-richard-buckner-surrounded/|7.7|Brian Howe

Alfieri's reponse was blunt: ""Currently, I interpret our name to signify the environment's constant passive reminder that we're slowly destroying it."" Alfieri also waxed lyrical about his home state, telling Stosuy that ""New Hampshire is a land of contrast. Cold, bleak winters give way to hot, humid summers. The green leaves of spring burn red orange in the fall. You can see the ocean from the mountains."" The reverence and the lyric note in his voice provide some insight into the band's awe-inspiring, violently gorgeous first full-length, <i>Sky Swallower</i>.</p>
<p>The album starts in the recognizable, misty-forest environs of early Scandinavian black metal: Opener ""New Alchemy"" bludgeons with the familiar all-sixteenths assault of guitars, drums, and bass, and the riff is a close harmonic cousin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"" target=""_blank"">Darkthrone</a>'s ""Transilvanian Hunger"". But after a few minutes of this locked spiral, the grip slackens, the drumming relaxes into eighth notes, then quarters, before the song yawns open into droning doom metal. By the end, ""Alchemy"" has receded further into glimmering, clean-toned guitar notes and lightly syncopated drum fills, and we're no  longer in any one place: Vattnet have already stormed across acres of territory. They rage and mourn across this massive open space for the next 32 minutes, and by the time the album has reached the regally chilly final track ""Apex"", you, too, can see the ocean from the mountains.</p>
<p>Like many other American metal bands (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30991-inter-arma/"" target=""_blank"">Inter Arma</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"" target=""_blank"">Deafheaven</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4617-woe/"" target=""_blank"">Woe</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31627-castevet/"" target=""_blank"">Castevet</a>, for example), Vattnet Viskar are stylistic nomads; in a field where every choice of drum beat is loaded with fiercely specific, coded information, they pluck useful stuff from wherever they find it. The middle-distance savagery of metalgaze, dour instrumental rock, the shuddering churn of doom metal-- Vattnet Viskar swallow it all, all usually within the space of the same song. The expansive power chords opening the short instrumental ""Monarch"" could be from Arkansas doom outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30107-pallbearer/"" target=""_blank"">Pallbearer</a>, though when Nick Thornbury sings on the following track, ""Breath of the Almighty, his voice is harsh and guttural and wet-sounding in a way more reminiscent of death than black metal-- you can hear individual spit bubbles pop and gurgle in back of his throat. The band's full attack has a similarly muscular ugliness to it, a visceral sound that can shrink suddenly pinhole-quiet.</p>
<p>In his Show No Mercy interview, Alfieri also talked about how hard the band thought about long-form structure-- peaks, dynamics, threading themes through a composition. This kind of under-the-hood point-plotting rarely sounds sexy, but you can feel it, even without an iota of musical training, coursing beneath <i>Sky Swallower</i>'s 38 minutes, whispering beneath the roar. There are a few stunning moments on <i>Sky Swallower</i> when everything drops away: Midway through ""Breath of the Almighty"" for instance, the band dissipates after three or so minutes and nothing is left but two strings of guitar and a bass. The moment hangs, darkening, for several minutes, echoing a similar, earlier interlude in ""Fog of Apathy"". The last sound on the album is a lone acoustic, strumming two chords-- the lingering note of sadness, maybe that pulses beneath<i> Sky Swallower</i>, trailing off.</p></div>"|18504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18504-vattnet-viskar-sky-swallower/|8.0|Jayson Greene

In his attempts to reach audiences beyond his faithful base of goths and gamers, Trent Reznor has embraced both high concepts (2007’s interactive song-cycle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10125-year-zero/"" target=""_blank""><i>Year Zero</i></a>) and low overhead (2008’s self-released offerings <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11289-ghosts-i-iv/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghosts I-IV</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11503-the-slip/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Slip</i></a>); even a guy who got famous by screaming needed a good news hook to get himself heard over the incessant din of a quick-click online-music marketplace. For his latest Nine Inch Nails release, Reznor is resorting to the most radical release strategy an independent-minded artist can employ in 2013: he’s re-signed to a major label. Those e-commerce experiments proved NIN can remain a viable business in the absence of corporate-funded marketing campaigns, but he presumably wants something that not even 100 per cent royalty rates can buy you: to be a game-changing pop cultural force once again. And despite what tech-topian industry analysts would have us believe, for the time being at least, traditional tools like global major-label distribution and aggressive radio promotion still often mean the difference between an artist being a household name or a merely respected one.</p>
<p>That said, even as Reznor is rallying everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"" target=""_blank"">David Lynch</a> to <i>Downward Spiral</i> cover artist Russell Mills to heighten the sense of occasion, he’s not giving his Columbia Records benefactors an easy sell: The aptly titled <i>Hesitation Marks</i> is a record that pokes and prods and teases instead of going in for the kill. It’s the first record to bear the Nine Inch Nails name since Reznor announced a hiatus in 2009 but the valorous comeback narrative is undermined by the fact that Reznor often took five years to release new NIN albums anyway. Not to mention the fact that he's remained highly active in the interim, releasing two albums with his trip-hoppy outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28841-how-to-destroy-angels/"" target=""_blank"">How to destroy angels</a> while embarking on a successful composing career that allowed us to see what he looks like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQSHQVAktP4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a suit</a>. And yet <i>Hesitation Marks</i> is stuffed with more knowing resurrection references than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Z</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9647-kingdom-come/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kingdom Come</i></a>-- for an artist whose every second lyric has begun with the word “I,” this could be Reznor’s most intensely self-reflexive work yet. But unlike the themes of depression, madness, and addiction that defined his most enduring music, <i>Hesitation Marks</i> chronicles a more existential crisis of relevance. Accordingly, its sound is skeletal and spare, as if picking up right where <i>The Slip</i>’s more subdued second act left off, with Reznor's usual adrenalized aggression replaced with jagged digital tics and queasy atmospheres.</p>
<p>And yet the more austere, minimalist approach allows Reznor to explore the outer limits of the Nine Inch Nails sound. Notwithstanding the ambient excursions of<i> Ghosts I-IV</i>, NIN’s song-based post-millennial discography has mostly functioned within the sonic parameters laid down by Reznor’s all-time favorites-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a>, Berlin-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a>, Pink Floyd’s <i>The Wall</i>, Jane’s Addiction, and a pinch of Prince-- while seeming impervious to shifts in the contemporary dance-rock landscape. <i>Hesitation Marks</i> is much more in tune with the spartan grooves of the xx and the elastic electro of the Knife than his usual arena-rattling influences: “Copy of A” follows an uncannily similar trajectory as the latter duo’s “Full of Fire”, locking into a motorik beat that remains coolly resolute in the face of all the intensifying textural disorder mounting overtop of it. In a world where there are no more Stabbing Westwards to kick around, Reznor directs the song’s critique of conformity at himself: “I am just a copy of a copy of a copy/ Everything I say has come before.”</p>
<p>For a song that acknowledges the predictability of lapsing into old patterns, “Copy of A” ironically marks an intriguing change of pace for Nine Inch Nails, stripping down their metal machine music and rebuilding it with only the most integral scraps. The best songs here follow a similar process of gradually fleshing out a skeleton, from the fidgety funk of “Satellite” to the disquieting drive of “Disappointed”, where wondrous, Indian-inspired string swirls -- a la the Beatles’ “Within You, Without You”-- cut through the song’s claustrophobic clap-track. And even when the threadbare presentation casts a harsh light on the odd underwritten lyric (“Hey!/ Everything is not/ Okay!”), Reznor introduces new melodic changes to push a song in unexpected new directions: just when you think “All Time Low” can’t get any closer to “Closer”, the song detours into a kaleidoscopic coda that introduces a brief flash of radiant colour to Nine Inch Nails’ typically grim and grimy terrain.</p>
<p>But the danger of stretching your sound out to its extremities is that it will eventually snap back in your face, and the completely incongruous “Everything” overcompensates for <i>Hesitation Marks</i>’ ominous mood with a wincingly bright pop-punk chug-- and unflatteringly strained vocal from Reznor-- that sounds like a second-stage Warped Tour act trying to cover “Just Like Heaven”. And the album is ultimately lacking in the concision and sequential logic that made <i>The Slip</i> such an invigorating late-career triumph. For every circuit-overloading workout like “Copy of A” and “Disappointed”, there are a number of tracks where Reznor reverts to the teeth-gnashing angst of old without the pig-marching blitzkriegs to back it up, applying undue pressure on the the songs’ brittle structures. The all-too-aptly titled single “Came Back Haunted” is just that, a ghost of Nine Inch Nails’ more convincing ragers, while the album’s second half in particular is bogged down by dead-weight plodders (“Various Methods of Escape”, “I Would For You”, “In Two”) whose predictably amped-up choruses can’t enliven their sputtering tempos and flagging energy.</p>
<p>Alas, their presence mutes the impact of the strategically placed penultimate piece “While I’m Still Here”, which, with better lead-in tracks, could’ve served as a more dramatic comedown moment, but here feels like a pained stumble to the finish line; when Reznor says, “I’m still here”-- overtop a synth line that flickers like a dying fluorescent light tube-- it feels less like a statement of survival and defiance than the ennui-ridden admission of an office drone. But in the album’s dying moments, an encouraging sign of life emerges: a surprisingly playful series of saxophone blurts give way to the closing “Black Noise”, a slow-motion 90-second swell of grueling guitar noise that feels like all of this album’s simmering tension bubbling up to the surface and ready to erupt. Hopefully, next time, Reznor will unleash it without hesitation.</p></div>"|18443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18443-nine-inch-nails-hesitation-marks/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Points on the map correspond to songs on the tracklist to show where each is set. First single, “This Is Our Season"", takes places at Plainfield Elementary School before heading west on Chellis Road; “Walking Without Frankie” wanders from Soucy’s Gas Station over to the Lake of the Strangled Crane. It’s a clever visual element, a reminder that packaging can complement an album and help shape our listening experience. Without getting into the debate over physical vs. digital, I will say that holding the paper map in your hands as you listen to these new songs is very different from looking at a .pdf on your computer screen, where it has no texture, no physicality-- and therefore no memory rhyme of the real treasure maps that most children make of their own neighborhoods. That is exactly what Sheff and evoke with this piece of ephemera: the mystery of childhood, the unbridgeable gulf between what was and what we remember.</p>
<p><i>The Silver Gymnasium</i> is, in other words, a coming-of-age album: 11 songs that plumb the loss of innocence and youth, a young man’s first glimpses into the adult world of conflict, compromise, and confusion. It’s exactly as cohesive and novelistic as Okkervil river’s last decade’s worth of work, which explored the mythology of rock and roll. In 2005 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5963-black-sheep-boy/""><i>Black Sheep Boy</i></a> told a phantasmagorical tale of Tim Hardin’s doomed character (from the song of the same title) coming to pained life, while both 2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10509-the-stage-names/""><i>The Stage Names</i></a> and 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12176-the-stand-ins/""><i>The Stand-Ins</i> </a>delved further into that world’s rock-and-roll grotesquerie, famously wrenching “Sloop John B” out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Brian Wilson</a>’s hands and casting it as a boat-trip to hell. Rather than romanticize the experience of a life spent in tour vans and on club stages, Sheff presented it as a dark picaresque. This was a different way of writing what he knew, and his fictions were drawn from liner notes, band photos, song lyrics, and the tall tales of backstage crews in small markets.</p>
<p>The difference between that string of albums and <i>The Silver Gymnasium</i> is that on this new album Sheff is singing about his own personal mythology, mapping the terrain of his own life, and commemorating (perhaps memorializing) old friends who’ve grown too far apart. Sheff has ostensibly mined this territory before, on early tracks like “Listening to Otis Redding at Home During Christmas” (on the band’s second album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5960-dont-fall-in-love-with-everyone-you-see/"">Don’t Fall in Love with Everyone You See</a>)</i> or like “A Favor” (off their 2004 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5962-sleep-and-wake-up-songs-ep/""><i>Sleep and Wake-Up Songs</i></a>). But this album represents the deepest he has descended into this material as well as his most sustained examination of his own origins. While not quite as fantastical as previous albums, <i>The Silver Gymnasium</i> avoids the pitfalls of self-absorption and confessionalism; he’s less a participant in these stories than an observer and enabler who understands his own memory is unreliable. </p>
<p>Sheff evokes the milieu briskly, hinting at a 1980s childhood without resorting to cheesy period details. “Tell me about the greatest show, or the greatest movie you know,” he cajoles a friend on “Down Down the Deep River”, “or the greatest song that you taped off the radio. Play it again and again. (It cuts off at the ending, though.)” He’s literary without being pretentious (those parentheses are Sheff’s), his text-block lyrics lending themselves to slippery sentiments and corkscrew melodies. Those lines in particular, much like the Meriden map, are simultaneously personal and universal: every kid in 1988 was waiting for his or her favorite song to come on the radio, and every kid was waiting for just the right moment to press &lt;RECORD&gt;. Yet Sheff manages to make the experience sound new and immediate, not to mention loaded with uncomfortable meaning.</p>
<p>Conceptually, <i>The Silver Gymnasium</i> is sound; lyrically, this is incredibly fertile territory and more than enough to hang an album on. Musically, however, it may be Okkervil River’s weakest to date. On previous albums Sheff sang like a man who had already seen too much in a single lifetime, delivering his lines with a sputtering urgency that lent even the quieter songs a palpable dread. Meanwhile, the band itself sounded like they were trying to stave off his hysteria. They played like a slap to the face. On <i>The Silver Gymnasium, </i>however, they rarely let the cracks and strains show, and the songs suffer considerably. There’s little menace or madness here; instead the music gives the false impression of emotional orderliness.</p>
<p>This is Okkervil River’s first album working with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7052-john-agnello/"">John Agnello</a>, who has helmed period-specific albums by Cyndi Lauper and John Mellencamp, among others. He lends these songs a careful sheen when they ought to sound taped off the radio. Synths play a prominent role on <i>The Silver Gymnasium</i>, even more so now than when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3762-shearwater/"">Jonathan Meiburg</a> was still with the band. Rather than reach back to this particular era in pop music, on “Stay Young” and “Lido Pier Suicide Car” the synths sound generically crisp, reinforcing the sense of polish and calculation. Even the sax and harmonica solos on “Stay Young” are mixed low, as though the band remains noncommittal about featuring those instruments.</p>
<p>It’s hard to miss that this sonic development coincides with the band’s move from Jagjaguwar (their home for more than a decade) to ATO Records (home to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1183-drive-by-truckers/"">Drive-By Truckers</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30335-alabama-shakes/"">Alabama Shakes</a>, and the <i>True Blood</i> soundtrack). Ostensibly they’re making a bid for a wider audience, and why shouldn’t they? It would be amazing to hear how Sheff’s mythologies play to larger crowds in roomier venues. Okkervil River don’t have to sound right on the precipice of madness to be interesting, but unfortunately <i>The Silver Gymnasium</i> buffs away their eccentricities and robs the music of its impact. They aim for jittery energy on “Walking Without Frankie”, but it sounds inert. They shoot for triumphal on “On a Balcony”, but there’s no heft to those backing vocals. They reach for tattered majesty on closer “Black Nemo”, but they never hoist the flag quite high enough. Perhaps when performed live these songs will accrue the desperation and dynamism their studio versions lack, but for now <i>The Silver Gymnasium</i> too often makes the act of remembering sound like a consequence-free undertaking, as though certain horrors are too far in the past to do us much harm in the present. Anyone with a memory-- especially Sheff-- knows that’s not the case.  </p></div>"|18457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18457-okkervil-river-the-silver-gymnasium/|6.8|Stephen M. Deusner

The music-- which with the exception of some vocal lines by a Rwandan singer named Emmanuel Nzaramba was recorded entirely by 25-year-old Cape Town, South Africa resident <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31428-john-wizards/"" target=""_blank"">John Withers</a>-- is a bird's eye view of styles that are not only pan-African but, as goes the great promise of cultural consumption in the internet age, pan-global. Click down on one section of <i>John Wizards</i> and you'll hear the peppy end of Ghanaian highlife or the crisp optimism of Withers' native mbaqanga; click down on another and you'll hear 80s disco or swing-heavy instrumental hip-hop not all that far removed from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>, executed in compact, synthetic sounds that pop in the mix like foil-covered candy from a crystal dish. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A self-diagnosed daydreamer who makes his living writing ad jingles, Withers breaks down music into short, catchy bursts. Most of the songs on <i>John Wizards</i> are under three minutes long, and even those rarely hold onto a single melody or idea for more than 30 seconds. There are high points-- all of the kaleidoscopic opener ""Tet Lek Schrempf"", most of ""Lushoto"", the sweet, Auto-Tuned vocal of ""I'm Still a Serious Guy"", or ""iYongwe""'s guitar line, which once heard required active mental scrubbing to forget-- but the album's strength is ultimately in its breadth, not depth. Look too close and its songs crumble, but take them as pieces of a whole and the music takes on the playful energy of a mixtape: sweeping its diversity, charming in its curiosity, and generally more geared to the pleasure of the listener than the self-expression of the artist. </p>
<p class=""p1"">All of which can sometimes make <i>John Wizards</i> feel slight or disposable-- a Tumblr-era album made by an artist who functions more as a shrewd organizer of style than a composer of indelible music. Toward the end of an interview he did <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9148-john-wizards/"" target=""_blank"">with Pitchfork in June</a>, Withers was asked two questions: One was if his employers in the ad business ever asked him to imitate other bands; the other was how he might feel if someone ever asked him to imitate John Wizards. The second question struck me as funny, because Withers still basically sounds like an imitative musician. What sets him apart is the range and fluidity of his imitations, and the unifying cheerfulness with which he executes them. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Obviously African but easily fit into a conversation about contemporary American indie-pop, released on the mostly-techno label Planet Mu despite not being a techno album, satisfying an imagined ideal of post-internet globalism while remaining a personal and localized experience, arriving at a time when hot colors and wild geometric patterns remain fashionable, <i>John Wizards</i> is, to paraphrase the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss' opinion on animals, ""good to think with."" But that won't make people want to listen to it. What will is its hip diversity, sunny disposition, and the fact that Withers never asks more of his audience than he's willing to give: A man of contract, he puts his clients first. </p></div>"|18454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18454-john-wizards-john-wizards/|7.4|Mike Powell

At least, there’s no scene like they have in Copenhagen, a community centered around the boutique <a href=""http://poshisolation.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Posh Isolation</a> label started in 2009 by Christian Stadsgaard and Loke Rahbek. This is the label that launched a thousand Danish hardcore post-punk bands and their synth-noise side projects like Sexdrome, Damien Dubrovnik, Marching Church, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30758-lust-for-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Lust For Youth</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30406-var/"" target=""_blank"">Vår</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30458-lower/"" target=""_blank"">Lower</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"" target=""_blank"">Iceage</a>-- all of whom share at least one or more members between them. Andreas Lagerström,the lead singer and bassist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30222-holograms"" target=""_blank"">Holograms</a>, said in an <a href=""http://foggygirlsclub.blogspot.com/2013/01/holograms-block-busters-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> earlier this year, “we have nothing like that in Stockholm. We really like Iceage [and] Lower but most of us didn’t know about them when we started.” Though, he did admit to talking with Iceage on MySpace “like, five years ago when they were like thirteen or something.”</p>
<p>So there’s Posh Isolation and then there’s real isolation like what the young Holograms have experienced after a grueling and bank-breaking 2012 world tour. Returning to their homes in the night-swept winter of Stockholm with no jobs, no money, and no real scene to speak of, their only lifelines were each other. Add in the only six or seven hours of sunlight that Stockholm was getting in the winter, the backdrop for the band’s sophomore album <i>Forever</i> starts to come into focus. Even for hyperborean punk, things were dark. Given the circumstances, and their precedent for synth-heavy dourness on their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16901-holograms/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, it would be understandable for the band to turn in an exhausted and slapdash placeholder until conditions improved, or at least until two of the band members stretched their legs and formed a synth-noise side project. Instead, the factory-floor post-punk quartet doubled down on their sound and literally went for broke, taking their fear and desolation and sending it out to near arena heights.</p>
<p>Lead single, the corporeal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15268-holograms-flesh-and-bone/"" target=""_blank"">“Flesh And Bone”</a> served as a bellwether as to where the band was heading, but it was just the tip. Its Peter Hook bass line and down-stroked eighth-note guitars lead the album much like they lead the song-- Now they have more in common with the sharpness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a> or even the thickness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1426-editors"" target=""_blank"">Editors</a>, and creep further away from the electro-punk or hardcore-punk of their Danish doppelgangers. Most remarkable about Holograms is how they transform their pitch-black palate of sounds into something remarkably bright. Flying in the face of insular self-pity, they avoid all the trappings of isolation and turn it into 10 songs whose every syllable warrants a fist pump.</p>
<p>And that’s mainly because every syllable Lagerström sings in his hollow-headed voice is fully loaded with drama. <i>Forever</i>, much like its artwork-- cropped from a William Bouguereau painting depicting two cursed souls battling in the pit of hell-- is about epic themes told with tendons and teeth. Near every song makes mention of fire, whether in a positive light like the fire of love on “Luminous”, or a funeral pyre on “Wolves"". Or sharing fire at the bottom of the ocean on “Rush”. Or fire and stone on “A Sacred State"". Or just all of “A Blaze On A Hillside"". Lagerström’s almost Promethean obsession with flames notwithstanding, he always has one foot in his own reality and the other in something far more mythical. The songs strike a sort of lost-in-translation vibe between the personal and the preposterous, like the sleepy ""Ättestupa"", named after a kind of cliff where, according to Nordic myth, old men once threw themselves to their death when they were no longer useful. In a blind taste test, you probably wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between an <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/5048-opeth/"" target=""_blank"">Opeth</a> lyric and a Holograms lyric.</p>
<p>But pair these songs of ice and fire with the band’s newfound lean rock look, and that’s where it starts to kick. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15684-holograms-meditations/"" target=""_blank"">“Meditations” </a>has this everybody-now chorus of “Destruction! Destruction! Destruction!” that is just the kind of populist punk Holograms can excel at. Likewise, the finale of “Luminous” features a drunken pub-punk shout-chorus, a refreshing break in the self-serious tone acting as welcomed and well-earned indulgence in a punk trope. </p>
<p>On <i>Forever, </i>Holograms take lofty themes and personal trials and make them a communal experience. They reflect their depression and mistrust into melodies with just enough pop to let people in, never getting too cagey or technical. Though the too familiar Factory Records sound helps color the mood, it's Lagerström’s howl the can make the broadest, most biblical phrase about eternity seem deeply personal. He puts all his chips in the climactic “A Blaze On The Hillside”, which might be the best update of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4pScqkaa6Y&amp;noredirect=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Transmission”</a> that’s been written. Lagerström lets loose for the only time on the album and screams “Mother! Father!” in a moment of uncalculated emotion. Hs seems finally unconcerned with aesthetic, or a scene, or money, or jobs, or fire.

He's mostly avoided it, adopting new monikers and collaborators at the pace of a much younger artist. The rot has crept in lately, as works under his given name, like 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14327-freiland-klaviermusik/"" target=""_blank""><i>Freiland Klaviermusik</i></a>, have been turgid, stuffy affairs. <i>Zukunft Ohne Menschen</i>-- created as part of an installation that will greet visitors to Cologne's art fair, Art Cologne-- returns to more pliable textures laid out in familiar, rhythmic sequences that could reasonably be described as riffs. In that sense, <i>Zukunft</i> is unexpectedly accessible, inasmuch as it features sounds and tones that creep into actual pop and dance music. But it's also flatly boring, repetitive and limited, begging the question of what it means to be stuck in a rut for an artist that has fashioned a career out of meticulous, repeating phrases.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Zukunft</i> is built from a paucity of elements, containing essentially two sounds: a thick, flatulent synth that functions as the bass, and a high-pitched, piano-like twinkle. Occasionally, as on ""Z.O.M 1.4"", a slight variation of these sounds is added. A dull kick drum accompanies these sounds on the second track, then disappears. The bass sound worms around, arranged in sequences that sound a little like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>'s Teutonic pulse but with every last drop of funk squeezed out. The higher-pitched sound cuts through the mix, occupying less space but demanding more attention. Voigt uses it to play improvised melodies, or at least melodies that sound improvised. And that's all: <i>Zukunft</i>'s entire hour-long runtime is composed of two sounds pirouetting around one another.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's important to note that this isn't virtuoso synthesizer work; these are common sounds that don't morph or change over the course each track. All of <i>Zukunft</i>'s artistry is tied to the composition of its patterns, which vary from painfully lethargic (""Z.O.M 1.5"", ""Z.O.M 1.8"") to mildly rambunctious (""Z.O.M 1.10""). The latter type of track whips up a modest, pointillist gust and at least gives the impression that something is happening. The slower tracks, though, play like a cynic's hammy impersonation of German computer music: laughably ponderous and self-serious. Voigt's minimal works have always benefitted from repeat listens and great attention, which reveal dubby iridescence and cryptic depth. <i>Zukunft</i>, though, has nothing to reveal. Its tones are staid, its patterns are boxy. It is music that rubs its limits in your face.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Zukunft</i> comes packaged with a book of digital/photographic art by Voigt, but it adds little context. Similarly, it's difficult to imagine <i>Zukunft</i> improving as the at-bat music for an art show. It's not welcoming or beautiful; It's obtuse and empty, echoing the very worst assumptions people have about modern art. <i>Zukunft</i> is also lazy, a one-idea album because only one idea was required. Unlike so much of Voigt's past work, it's not an idea worth exploring at this length. <i>Zukunft</i>'s only impressive feat is making Voigt's elegant, pristine work under guises like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27454-studio-1/"" target=""_blank"">Studio 1</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"" target=""_blank"">Gas</a> seem like the work of a raving, impassioned romantic.</p></div>"|18450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18450-wolfgang-voigt-zukunft-ohne-menschen/|4.4|Andrew Gaerig

First, let’s pause a moment to reflect on the fact that there <i>was </i>a 10th album already at that point, only eight years and a few months after Dylan released his self-titled debut. It was a busy time: he wrote and performed, culture was churning ahead and changing at what was then an unprecedented pace, and some people in the music world thought of him as a sort of leader of a new consciousness. Into this world he released an album called <i>Self Portrait</i>. One imagines seeing that title and expecting something deeper, heavier, some kind of reckoning with what has gone before. But what the listening public got instead was a mish-mash-- a few original songs, a few live cuts, lots of covers, and a generally disjointed sound. It seemed slapdash. And it caused Greil Marcus, Dylan’s best critic, to begin his review of the double album in <i>Rolling Stone </i>with the words “What is this shit?”</p>
<p>The latest entry in Dylan’s Bootleg Series provides a new opportunity to evaluate the music of this period. Calling this volume <i>Another Self Portrait</i>, including liner notes by Marcus, and offering up a new painting by Bob Dylan as a cover image, is a sly and gutsy move. By most accounts, Dylan was hurt by the initial savaging of <i>Self Portrait</i>, and rushed out its 1970 follow-up, <i>New Morning</i>, to put the album in the rearview as quickly as possible. Later, there was a sense that he wanted to scrub it from his own history. In interviews, Dylan sometimes suggested that <i>Self Portrait</i> was deliberately bad, thrown together as a way to confuse his audience or provoke the media into moving on to someone else so that he could have more privacy in raising his family.</p>
<p>Though we’ll never know exactly what he was thinking, the idea of Dylan making a poor album on purpose never made sense. He worked with too many top-shelf musicians that he cared about, and had friends and colleagues investing too much time, to make something that would embarrass them. It seems more likely that the “intentionally bad” storyline was a defense mechanism for a mysterious artist who did, after all, have a pretty hefty ego and was deeply aware of his own talent. So it’s reasonable to conclude that <i>Self Portrait</i> was a strange and all-over-the-place album because, for one reason or another, that’s the kind of album Dylan wanted to make at that time.</p>
<p><i>Another Self Portrait</i> complicates the narrative. Considering the strength of these alternate takes, demos, stripped-down mixes, and live cuts, it's a little hard to believe that these were the cast-offs from what was perceived to be an artist’s worst album. Many of the songs come from the sessions for <i>New Morning</i>, but there were no clear lines between <i>Self Portrait</i> and <i>New Morning</i> sessions in 1969 and 1970. Akin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>’s later method, Dylan at the end of the 60s seems to have been about recording songs first, lots of them, and figuring out how they fit into an album later.</p>
<p>There was a marked shift in Dylan's music at the end of the 60s. “For sure my lyrics had struck nerves that had never been struck before,” he wrote of this time in <i>Chronicles Volume One</i>, “but if my songs were just about the words, then what was Duane Eddy, the great rock'n'roll guitarist, doing recording an album full of instrumental melodies of my songs? Musicians have always known that my songs were more than just words, but most people are not musicians.” This passage provides a good framework for understanding the music here. After the word-drunk work he’d created in the mid-60s, and following the mysterious motorcycle accident that laid him up in 1966, his music became simpler and more tuneful. Drawing on his longstanding interest in country music, standards, and any well-constructed song, he began to write and perform songs that felt universal. </p>
<p>That is where the deep and immense pleasure of this set resides: hearing melodies-- some new, some old, some borrowed-- performed by a distinctive singer at the height of his powers. The two discs are arranged for flow, with songs roughly split along two lines. Disc one is mostly songs recorded prior to <i>Self Portrait</i>, and is heavy on alternate versions of Dylan tunes and renditions of traditional songs. This “Time Passes Slowly” and the demo of “Went to See the Gypsy” don’t supplant better-known takes, but they’re different enough in feel and arrangement to make the songs sound new. Other differences, like the alternate version of <i>Nashville Skyline</i>’s “I Threw It All Away”, are more subtle, and the appeal is in hearing the song tinted by a new setting. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But the real revelations on the first disc are the unreleased versions of songs from the public domain. It’s now accepted that Dylan returned to relevance late in his career when he released two albums of traditional songs, 1992‘s <i>Good as I Been to You</i> and 1993‘s <i>World Gone Wrong</i>. The idea being that, in times of trouble, when he’s not sure where else to go, the songs Dylan grew up with and studied were there for him. The versions here of “Railroad Bill”, “Little Sadie”, “Pretty Saro”, and the especially powerful “This Evening So Soon” are brilliant showcases of his ability to inhabit old material and make it his own. And they benefit from the generally spare and acoustic sound. Dylan started his career singing traditional folk songs, but his understanding of them eight years later was far richer. </p>
<p>The second disc is heavier on versions of Dylan originals, with roughly equal smatterings of alternate takes from <i>Self Portrait</i>, <i>New Morning</i>, and <i>Nashville Skyline</i> and live cuts from Dylan and the Band’s 1969 Isle of Wight Festival performance. Some of the differences in these versions are striking. The radically altered take of “If Not For You” is performed by Dylan with piano and violin, making the song sound even more tender and vulnerable. There’s an alternate version of the funky <i>Nashville Skyline</i> trifle “Country Pie” that, when it breaks down, shows just how in-the-pocket his session pros were when playing live in the studio. There’s a version of “New Morning” with a shimmering horn section, giving it an even more buoyant and joyous cast. “Wigwam”, the instrumental that was given a bombastic treatment on the <i>Self Portrait</i> album, is heard without orchestration, revealing it as an effortlessly tuneful cowboy tune (the countrypolitan near-instrumental “All the Tired Horses” is heard in a similarly lean version). </p>
<p>Most of the music is heard in versions with minimal instrumentation: Dylan’s guitar, a second guitar adding fills, sometimes piano. Which makes the set oddly cohesive and album-like, ironically more so than the <i>Self Portrait</i> album itself. The outliers in this regard were also some of the stranger inclusions on the original album-- the in-concert tracks with the Band. Given that neither Dylan nor the Band played live during this period, the fact that they came together for a massive festival was surely big news, so the set is obviously of historical importance. That is doubly true since by this time the recordings they made together in Woodstock were leaking out on bootlegs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8937-this-little-conspiracy-the-great-white-wonder-and-the-dawn-of-the-album-leak/""><i>The Great White Wonder</i></a>, so the desire for Dylan/Band collaborations was high. But plucking random numbers from that Isle of Wight set didn’t make much sense on the original album, and it doesn’t make much sense on <i>Another Self Portrait</i> either. The deluxe version of this set includes a disc with the full set, which is welcome-- it has a ragtag charm, Dylan mostly sings in his <i>Nashville Skyline</i> voice, and the song selection is ace. But there’s still a weird distance to it all, a lack of intensity that is hard to put a finger on, with laid back versions of familiar tunes that don’t really probe for any new meanings. </p>
<p>The deluxe version also includes a remastered version of the <i>Self Portrait</i> album proper. Returning to it, it’s hard for those of us a generation or two younger to understand the reaction to it not because it paled in comparison to the greatness that came before, because it obviously did. If you’ve spent any time listening to Bob Dylan’s 1960s catalog, you are still trying to wrap your head around the thought that one person wrote the 56 songs on <i>Bringing it All Back Home</i>, <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>, <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, <i>John Wesley Harding</i>, and <i>Nashville Skyline</i> between 1965 and 1969. <i>Self Portrait</i>, next to these records, in that moment, must have seemed like a joke. But later generations hear it differently. We’ve discovered <i>Self Portrait</i> in the used bins, torrent downloads, and streaming services alongside records like <i>Street Legal</i>, <i>Saved</i>, <i>Empire Burlesque</i>, <i>Down in the Groove</i>, and <i>Under the Red Sky</i>. And in this broader context, it sounds quite good, another weird and sloppy record from a guy who released a lot of them. And hearing it again with all the fantastic music that surrounded it, music that further cements Dylan’s Bootleg Series as one of the most important archival projects in modern pop history, it remains a beguiling artifact.</p></div>"|18402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18402-bob-dylan-bootleg-series-vol-10-another-self-portrait-1969-1971/|8.7|Mark Richardson

In fact, when you come to think of it, the band's entire career has been something of a slog for frontman Joe Cardamone and his seemingly ever-rotating cast of players. Gaining some attention with their 2001 debut <i>Mono</i>, their real breakthrough came two years later with the searing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4153-penance-soiree/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""><i>Penance Soiree</i></a>, a criminally overlooked album that seethed with danger and wit. Personal turmoil and label troubles spurned <i>Black Lives at the Golden Coast</i>, an all-over-the-place, holy mess of an album that all but completely sapped any momentum <i>Penance Soiree</i> might have gained them. By the time their fourth album--the snaky, villainous <i>Wildlife</i>-- rolled around, Icarus Line had been relegated to lifer status, an act all but forgotten thanks to their cockroach-like ability to soldier on in the face of utterly toxic circumstances-- drugs, money troubles, lineup-shifting creative differences. Though largely ignored in spite of its obvious quality, <i>Wildlife</i> marked the welcome return to the Stooge-ian hedonism of <i>Penance Soiree</i>. And now it's with <i>Slave Vows</i> that the Icarus Line continue on their road to redemption, offering up their best record since the one that should've made them contenders.<br/><br/>It's unlikely that the Icarus Line are going to hold it against you for brushing them off (""I don't care enough to hate you,"" Cardamone grumbles on ""Rat's Ass""), but sure as hell don't expect them to hold your hand, either. ""Dark Circles"" is an 11-minute ""fuck you"" of an opener, moving from a squall of torrential feedback to seasick, churning rhythms to an arid spaghetti Western-styled final act. It's not a great song, but rather a warning that if you aren't with them, you're against them, and now would be a good time to get out of the way. What follows is more earthen and scorched than anything the band has released to date, and while the formula on <i>Slave Vows</i> is fairly consistent-- songs start out comely, lurching and depraved, only to explode into id-startled fits of furious chaos and noise-- nothing feels forced or wasted. Recorded live to tape (the band's preferred method), the album taps into Icarus Line's infamous live show, complete with acid-scarred guitars and Cardamone's unique yelps and mutters and screams, which exude as much sex as they do terror.<br/><br/>""It's my fault I'm dedicated,"" he sings on ""Marathon Man"", sounding uncommonly principled for once. But it's his commitment to keeping <i>Slave Vows</i> as feral and uncompromising as it ultimately needs to be is what makes it so exciting. ""Marathon Man"" starts out snarling and slow, eventually giving way to a torrent of strangled noise that suggests every instrument is being physically wrestled and beaten into submission like rabid dogs. Even better is the sordid, striptease-ready ""Dead Body"", which starts off sounding like the perfect soundtrack for a good old fashioned roll in the glass, but as it explodes with such raw power and hellish riffage, the only thing it feels good for is triggering a panic attack. It's a jarring reminder of the viciousness this band is capable of.<br/><br/>Very little has been written about the Icarus Line without some mention of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17298-iggy-and-the-stooges/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Iggy and the Stooges</a>, and it's no wonder. Visit the band's <a href=""http://theicarusline.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">official website</a>, and you'll find a show flyer featuring a shirtless Cardamone lit in a very familiar orange fluorescence. But to fault Icarus Line for aping seminal punk, garage and no wave acts is to discount just how good they are at translating and nourishing these touchstones. If you could convincingly pull off an approximation of the Stooges frenzied fusion of sex and danger, then why the hell wouldn't you? Only on the final three tracks do the band go full Wild Child, which instead of sounding, well, slavish are instead nothing but a pleasure. The closest they get here to an actual bite is ""No Money Music"", which sounds almost exactly like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Suicide</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGLJoXpKo4U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ghost Rider""</a>, right down to those piercing, echoed screams. In less capable hands it would feel cliché; here it's convincingly harried and frightening and nuts.<br/><br/><i>Slave Vows</i> could use a little fine tuning, of course. At 45 minutes it's shorter than <i>Penance Soiree</i>, but lacks its concision and punch<i></i>, at times wading a little too deeply into the indulgent waters of burdened, discordant blooze. And Cardamone-- despite convincingly inhabiting the sunken-eyed Lothario he truly is-- plays up the misestimated shock value a little more than he needs to (""Brick by brick, white people are fucking sick""). But at its core, <i>Slave Vows</i> is an album that plays by its own set of rules, unencumbered by any sort of expectation; it's one of the few perks being left for dead offers. ""It's been the end of times for a long time,"" Cardamone murmurs on the sulphuric ""Laying Down for the Man"". If <i>Slave Vows </i>is any indication, it's anything but.</p></div>"|18461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18461-icarus-line-slave-vows/|6.9|Zach Kelly

It also felt like one of the first well-beneath-the-radar “Made in Brooklyn” tracks to travel far outside of the borough to other cities. For those listening close, it suggested that something was brewing beyond the island of Manhattan.</p>
<p>And while his Runaway counterpart Jacques Renault has gone on to throw the popular “Let’s Play House” party and release records on an imprint of the same name, Cabral has kept a relatively low profile. Yet it was his <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/l-i-e-s/marcos-cabral-24-hour-flight-l"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>24 Hour Flight</i> EP</a> on the nascent Long Island Electrical Systems (L.I.E.S.) that began to turn heads, both to Cabral and to the label that released it. And for good reason: the extremely limited release showed Cabral to be a master craftsman at making hypnotic and deep three o’clock in the morning style tracks. So it makes a certain amount of sense that L.I.E.S.’s inaugural full-length artist release would also come from Cabral, marking his first album with <i>False Memories</i>.</p>
<p>But as its title suggests, things are not quite as they appear, as instead of offering up a selection of tracks that might complement the sounds to be found on <i>24 Hour Flight</i> and subsequent releases, <i>False Memories</i> instead digs into Cabral’s personal cassette tape archive. As the press sheet for the album notes, the album’s 14 tracks stem from Cabral’s initial forays into recording, done while living in upstate New York. “I knew nothing about ‘making’ music at this time and was using this fairly primitive wav-looping program called Acid,” Cabral wrote, using a 303 and his computer to make loops.</p>
<p>The result offers a very rough, primitive portrait of the producer, which hews close to the L.I.E.S. aesthetic but not always to Cabral’s strengths. Opener “Downhill” is murky and throbbing but while its metallic stabs shine through, not much else happens on the track. The kinetic three-minute “Homemade Muffler” suggests the junkyard playfulness of Eric Copeland's recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18254-eric-copeland-joke-in-the-hole/"" target=""_blank""><i>Joke in the Hole</i></a>. There’s an almost cartoonish scampering sound running head on into a 303’s kick, which sends noisy curlicues shooting off in every direction.</p>
<p>The tiny squelches and cricket-sized noises of “North Carolina” remind me at times of the obtuse releases of Lithops, the solo guise of Mouse on Mars’ Jan St. Werner. But where those tracks fidget, Cabral is cautious, feeling his way through the track. “Unusually Early” mixes pulses, snare hits, and another drum sound flanged to the extreme, with no other melodic element, to where its three minutes seem to last a lifetime. “Repaired Clocks” has a stronger beat but still feels incomplete, missing the sound of Cabral’s chords that would emerge on later productions. Loping and lo-fi as “Virginia” is, it has a lightness not to be found elsewhere courtesy of a metallic snare sound stretched like taffy. “Broken Clocks” is the grittiest and most distorted track on here, as if transmitted through heavy static.</p>
<p><i>False Memories</i> is true its intent of documenting the sound of experimentation at its most unlearned by a producer who has an excellent touch for his productions in the present moment. Unfortunately, here ""experimenting"" mostly means letting the tape run as one plays with pitch and gain, or else cloaking everything in delay, or else turning the filter knob every which direction. For the first long look at Cabral for most outside of L.I.E.S. devotees, it’s unlikely to make a lasting impression.</p></div>"|18310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18310-marcos-cabral-false-memories/|6.5|Andy Beta

It's the story of a man who, after surviving a plane crash no one in his life seems to care much about, rapidly comes unmoored from the things he's come to know. His wife leaves him, he acts up in front of friends and neighbors, he falls for the underaged babysitter. ""Country Husband"" examines the intersection of our public and private selves, about the things we hold back to make it through the day. Nicolaus is something of a Cheever obsessive; the video for <a href=""http://www.yeproc.com/artists/golden-suits"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Golden Suits</a>' ""Swimming in '99"" finds Nicolaus criss-crossing Manhattan, looking to buy up every copy of <i>The Stories of John Cheever</i> he can get his hands on. But his relationship with ""The Country Husband"" goes well beyond the need to fill empty bookshelves. In the year or so leading up to <i>Golden Suits</i>, he underwent a massive, life-upending transformation of his own. He went broke, saw the end of a longstanding relationship, lost an apartment to a rat infestation, and dropped 40 pounds.</p>
<p>Despite the hardships, Nicolaus puts on a fairly good face throughout <i>Golden Suits</i>. On the surface, <i>Golden Suits</i> is a lilting folk-pop record, deliberate as they come, swimming in sumptuous, sunlit arrangements. With their nimble verses floating into stately, borderline regal choruses, Nicolaus is clearly aiming for a certain time-honored decorousness here, hewing to classic forms at every turn, letting any weirdness seep out in the arrangements. He's a precise vocalist, hanging out just behind the beat, finding some space for every syllable. Still, that kind of composure does seem a bit at odds with the Nicolaus who's spent the last year picking through the wreckage of his life.</p>
<p>This authorial detachment-- along with all the flirting-with-anodyne ""classic"" structures-- occasionally leaves <i>Golden Suits</i> feeling guarded. Nicolaus, a student of the short story, will set a scene (""Restaurant Song""), introduce a character or two (""Dearly Beloved,"" ""Little One""), toss out couple tantalizing details, and leave it at that; he makes plenty of intimations of loss and regret-- ""please tell me you need me, keep me where I am,"" that sort of thing-- but rarely does it feel like he's laying it all out there for you. This ambiguity leaves <i>Golden Suits</i> feeling both safe and slightly unknowable, as Nicolaus-- perhaps still gun-shy after everything he's had to endure-- plays things just a little too close to the chest.</p>
<p>Between the straightforward songcraft and the spare lyricism, there's plenty of space to fill. Whether it's a scurry of strings (arranged by Kris Nolte and Ian Davis of Mason Jar Music), a warbling clarinet, or an anxious Rossen-style arpeggio, instruments sweep in and out of these songs like gusts of wind. While the songs themselves stay on the straight-and-narrow, these arrangements often lead them into strange places; the serrated guitar underneath highlight ""Find a Way"" sways like a drunkard trying his damnedest to stay upright, and the harmonies swirling around ""You Can't Make Your Mind Up""-- courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30314-ava-luna/"" target=""_blank"">Ava Luna</a>'s Becca Kauffman and Felicia Douglass-- split the difference between eerie and ethereal. Best of all is ""Dearly Beloved"", its trickling guitars abruptly rising like crashing waves. Nicolaus seems to be counting on this instrumental interplay to amplify the implicit drama in his lyrics. Truth is, it usually works the other way; next to this rich, peculiar music, Nicolaus' reticence to reveal too much leaves Golden Suits' story feeling a little unfinished.</p></div>"|18397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18397-golden-suits-golden-suits/|6.0|Paul Thompson

The first proper introduction to the Georgia/Colorado duo came courtesy of a 2009 EP-- our loyalty was won halfway through the savage opener “Figures of Chained Spirits”. That they bounced to <a href=""http://www.profoundlorerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Profound Lore</a> the following year to release their debut full-length, <i>Crypt-Born and Tethered to Ruin</i>, hasn’t hurt, nor have two split releases with perfectly-suited conspirators Vorum and Cruciamentum.<i> Crypt-Born</i> was a sleeper hit with the black/death elite; four years later, it seemed high time for O.A. and Antinom to release a new full-length. Anticipation ballooned when Profound Lore announced its arrival, but instead of the long-playing overdose of death metal one may have expected, we’ve been blindsided with a short shock of an EP.</p>
<p><i>All Uproarious Darkness</i> blasts by in under 20 minutes, with nary a song stretching beyond the four-minute mark. In a subgenre characterized by excess-- more distortion, more blastbeats, more riffs, more violence-- Vasaeleth have delivered a lethal death strike in the amount of time it takes lesser bands to hit their first Incantation-biting groove. That influence is there, of course; the crumbling road to Golgotha has nearly buckled under the past few years’ heavy traffic, but out of the many au current old-school death metal bands, Vasaeleth are one of the few that truly get it right. Think Teitanblood or Grave Miasma instead of the armies of less stimulating clones. O.A. infuses his meaty chunks of vintage death metal riffage with a putrid black atmosphere, summoning a bestial effect akin to an updated version of Demoncy’s best material or even Impiety’s earlier work. The Archgoat and Incantation linchpins noted by the label are in there, too, but Vasaeleth are too smart to simply lift riffs from their own record collections.</p>
<p>They remain coldly focused, whether they’re hammering away with blunt force on the title track or allowing the frenzied mauling on “Black Curse Upheld” to decay into a painfully slow middle passage. The production remains appealingly murky, embracing the swirling chaos within and allowing only a faint glimpse into its inner workings. Milton would have wept had “Paradise Reconsecrated” ever crossed his consciousness-- the Fall of Man sounds like a stroll through Sumerian paradise compared to the aural barbarity on display here. When O.A. crashes down into a heaving torpor at 1:27, again at 2:19, and at the song’s end, it feels like the sky has blackened and fallen. It’s the kind of heaviness that sinks into your gut, drags your neck down, and overtakes you entirely. “Fathomless Wells of Ruin” embraces a similar dynamic, peppering its slow dives with harmonic squeals and a hideous hissed gurgle torn from O.A.’s throat. Vasaeleth are excellent at blasting through their manic paces, but they’re deadliest when they slow it down, ramp up the intensity, and just fucking punish.</p>
<p>“Throat of the Grey Watcher” is the album’s strongest track, exemplifying each of Vasaeleth’s best habits and tying it all together into a neat display of malice and control.<i> All Uproarious Darkness</i> could have felt too short, but such is Vasaeleth’s mastery of their craft that they knew just when to stop, and just how hard to strike. There's no room for fluff or ostentation here, no fat to be trimmed or bloated sections to be padded out. This band is above such petty tricks. Here, there is only darkness, desolation, and damn good songwriting.</p></div>"|18331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18331-vasaeleth-all-uproarious-darkness/|7.0|Kim Kelly

Unsteady, urgent, and skirting tonelessness, it leaks out of him in hair-raising bursts, a poorly kept secret in his birdlike body, and it heightens the emotional stakes of his music before you've internalized a word he's sung.  On his earliest recordings, first under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29366-zoo-kid/"" target=""_blank"">Zoo Kid</a> and then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29959-king-krule/"" target=""_blank"">King Krule</a>, he assembled a haunting, singular sound out of nothing but that voice, accompanied by some hard-strummed jazz chords on a broken-sounding electric guitar, some quiet, sputtering drum loops, and a blank wall of reverb. He sounded profoundly alone, but it was a jagged sort of aloneness, full of raw, exposed nerves and devoid of the comfort that solitude brings. ""My heart got hold of my head and ripped it to its seams,"" he sang on ""Bleak Bake"", a representative sentiment.</p>
<p>Marshall recorded those early songs on a malfunctioning laptop; now he's on True Panther (and XL Recordings in the UK), working with producer Rodaidh McDonald. <i>6 Feet Beneath the Moon, </i>his full-length debut, sounds roomier and warmer, and you can hear the music echo into the expansive room tone that McDonald brings to his work. But otherwise, this is the same chipped-brick urban landscape that Marshall prowled through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16011-king-krule/"" target=""_blank"">on his EP</a>. The music's surface swarms quietly with breaks, but nothing sounds busy or crowded, the way collage or pastiche-based music often does. It is muted and watery and stark, with a few intriguing elements dancing up near the top of the mix's surface: The drum track on ""Ceiling"" that sounds like a broken sprinkler; the muted jazz loop of ""Bathed In Grey,"" the chirping ""I just want you to know"" vocal sample in ""Will I Come.""</p>
<p>Marshall's voice is pushed further to the forefront, and he explores its gnarliest crags and catches. Something in Marshall's stance reminds me vaguely of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a>'s Isaac Brock; like Brock, Marshall's words seem to escape his gut like odd-angled shapes that hurt him as they exit. Also like Brock, he sounds warily intelligent, and though he projects a surly air, his songs are tender at the root. The lovely, drunken ballad ""Baby Blue"" turns on velvet, indigo guitar chords and a gently swooning vocal melody. Marshall has name-checked Chet Baker in interviews, and you can hear in ""Baby Blue"" what Baker's influence means to him: The song is flickering, low-lit, and romantic in a knowingly dime-store sort of way.</p>
<p>His lyrics occasionally play with clichés, and the way they emerge mangled from his vocal chords. ""When positivity seems hard to reach/ I keep my mouth shut/ Because when you're going through Hell/ You just keep going,"" he yowls on ""Easy Easy"". The lyrics read terribly, but even these ""Hang in There"" clichés are intriguingly dented by the sound of his voice. He loves rap, and some of the word tangles here suggest an interest in the way rappers get to fling around vivid clumps of language: ""The brain lives on but the vibes are dead/ Corrosively tread through emotionally spoonfed purpose,"" from ""Neptune Estate"".</p>
<p>There are some departures here, and they don't work well: a re-recorded version of the old Zoo Kid ""A Lizard State"" brings in a manic horn section to crash the party and Marshall punches up some of the least appealing lyrics he's ever written with an extra pinch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Waits</a>, yowling ""Where's the fucking fat bitches"" and ""I'm gonna tear you apart from the inside to the out."" Some of his earlier material is included (""Out Getting Ribs"" and ""Ocean Bed"") and it still rings out as some of his strongest work.</p>
<p>The only issue with <i>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</i> is that Marshall's sound is still a little inchoate, and you get a few compelling ideas rattling around loosely like pocket change, searching for a joining place. Over the course of <i>6 Feet</i>'s 52 minutes, the sound loses some of its essential mystery. Marshall still has a blood-freezing voice, someone to pay attention to, but <i>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</i> doesn't feel like his Big Statement, not yet.</p></div>"|18414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18414-6-feet-beneath-the-moon/|7.3|Jayson Greene

Yet there's something strangely elusive about them, owing not the least to Sly Stone's decades-long battle with his own public presence. The Cliff's Notes version of introductory pop music history tends to focus on only two albums: 1969's <i>Stand!</i>, their breakthrough smash filled with material that they'd work out at Woodstock, and 1971's <i>There's a Riot Goin' On</i>, a masterpiece of spotlight-panic resistance that heralded the decline of their crowdpleasing tendencies and the rise of funk as the decade's most innovative pop-music laboratory. They released three albums beforehand and another two afterwards on Epic, and getting that entire run isn't too difficult; the 2006 box set <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10161-the-collection/"">The Collection</a> </i>has them all remastered and supplemented with bonus B-sides and outtakes. But even a listen to that whole discography, from 1967's <i>A Whole New Thing </i>through 1974's <i>Small Talk</i>, retains a bit of enigma. Where'd they get their funk from, and why couldn't they stay, no matter how many people wanted them to?</p>
<p>Amazingly, <i>Higher! </i>expands on Sly &amp; the Family Stone's history and big-picture role in the development of pop and soul, acting as that rare box set that works as both an introduction for the unaware and a deep excursion into further context for dedicated fans. The major selling point for the physical media edition is an exhaustive run of annotated liner notes, the kind of detail-intensive minutae that satisfies curiosities alongside the usual supplement of rare photos and merchandise detritus. But the musical material alone is an attraction in itself, with 17 unreleased tracks and a good number of underheard ones to go with the big hit singles. Instant-recognition milestones like “I Want to Take You Higher”, “Hot Fun in the Summertime”, and “Everyday People” are released in original single-mix masters (including original mono versions where applicable), strewn amongst obscurities, live cuts, and alternate takes-- from a Francophone “Danse a La Musique” (credited to 'The French Fries') to a major chunk of their rarely heard set at 1970's Isle of Wight Festival. It's a perfectly balanced mix of stuff casual fans know and stuff even obsessives haven't heard.</p>
<p>If you want to get to where Sly &amp; the Family Stone came from, there's some vintage material that reveals origin points from the circa-64 days when the man then calling himself Sly Stewart was cutting dance-craze tracks for Autumn Records. Labelmate Bobby Freeman had a top 10 hit that year with the Sly-penned “C'mon and Swim”, and the first Sly Stewart single has him treading similar thematic water (“I Just Learned How to Swim” b/w “Scat Swim”). But it's also an early indicator that his vision wasn't easy to slot into any specific format-- the A-side's Chuck Berry riffage and Beach Boys harmonies flirt with garage and surf rock, with a horn-drenched backbeat that makes it good playlist lead-in material when you've got the Sonics on deck. The B-side? A little blues, a little jazz, and Sly going off like a guttural Cab Calloway.</p>
<p>The sides he'd record the following year-- “Buttermilk (Pt. 1)”, “Temptation Walk”, and an unreleased collaboration with his brother Freddie called “Dance All Night”-- were a bit more soul-skewing, but they still had that sort of all-purpose beat-music vibe that cares more about dancefloor hip-shaking momentum than any specific musical tradition. The only audience it specifically aimed towards was one that rocked go-go boots and Cuban heels-- everything else could fall into place later. Meanwhile, Stone hammered away at the keyboard and had a blast shaping his voice into something a bit out of control and distinct; he gargles out the titular ad-libs of “Buttermilk” with a comedic rasp that made him sound 50 years older than his early twenties.</p>
<p>That voice was heard on the regular through transistors and stereos in the Bay Area, as his radio DJ gig built up his rapport and performing persona to the point where his frontman status seemed inevitable. It's significant that Stone mixed up rock royalty like Dylan and the Beatles in with the Motown and Atlantic hits he spun during his sets, since he wound up putting his band together in a similar fashion: some rock here, some R&amp;B there, voices of men and women over instrumentation from both black and white artists. With brother Freddie and sister Rose as the literal Family, he brought in a versatile crew to act as the figurative one-- slap-and-pop fuzz-bass motivator Larry Graham, breakbeat Rushmore inductee Greg Errico, the two-person brass powerhouse of Jerry Martini on sax and Cynthia Robinson on trumpet, and the backup singers collectively known as Little Sister.</p>
<p>The material they released in their initial 11-month span-- <i>A Whole New Thing</i>, <i>Dance to the Music </i>and <i>Life-- </i>built up their progressive, funky musicianship, broke it down into more commercial-friendly get-down music, then reconstructed it all over again. All those albums charted modestly or worse, and only the title track of “Dance to the Music” approached anything resembling hit status. They're all excellent albums with plenty of highlights, though; the James Brown-gone-nova defiance of “Underdog”, the tongue-in-cheek creepshow devotion of “Trip to Your Heart”, and the motivational carnival-barker bounce of “Life” all could've and should've been hits before the band hit real chart paydirt in 69. But it's just as telling getting an earful of what was left off their records at the time. There's enough unearthed material from 1967 alone to emphasize all the directions the band were trying out: “Silent Communications” is a slow-building minimalist ballad that proves the players all sounded as amazing in drawn-out isolation as they were collectively, “I Get High on You” sneaks a country twang and nasal, drawling cartoon harmonics into their bottom-heavy thump, and “I Remember” and “Fortune and Fame” are pure gospel-soul vamps where Sly tears out his heart and replaces it with the tonewheel of a Hammond organ.</p>
<p>If there's any truth to the popular notion of upbeat music catching on when it's most needed to soothe our frayed collective nerves, <i>Stand! </i>was the album that 1969 needed. As psychedelia dissolved into roots-rock and heaviness eclipsed mellowness, Sly &amp; the Family Stone's career-making LP emerged as the first all-killer-no-filler pure funk album, their characteristic optimism given a deeper edge of resilient strength and wicked provocation in the face of the previous year's brutal turmoil. “Sing a Simple Song” becomes something that's “all I have to hang on to”; “Everyday People” turns prejudice into a mocking playground chant; “Somebody's Watching You” is the lightest performance with the heaviest sense of dread. Factor in <i>Stand!</i>, the appearance at Woodstock that the album's success allowed, and the string of astounding singles that capped off their year-- “Hot Fun in the Summertime” and the double-whammy of “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)” b/w “Everybody Is a Star”-- and the idea of Sly &amp; the Family Stone as anything other than an era-defining colossus of all-genre pop is unthinkable.</p>
<p>When their <i>Greatest Hits </i>was released late in 1970, Robert Christgau's A+ review called it “among the greatest rock and roll LPs of all time”; the categorization more surprising in hindsight than the high praise itself. Sly &amp; the Family Stone did a lot to reunite the spirits of the increasingly segregated forms of rock and R&amp;B in the late 60s, but Sly's most breathtaking start-to-finish work in 71-- and all ensuing LPs for the rest of that run on Epic-- fell closer into the funk and soul diaspora, if it could be contained at all. There's plenty that's been said about <i>There's a Riot Goin' On </i>that further words can't do much justice to; it's the sound of one man splintering apart away from the Family he shared a name with and singing like someone dragging a key across the finish of a gleaming new supercar. Given the constant delays and the drastic change in tone, it was commercial suicide-- except it wasn't. Both the LP and lead single “Family Affair” hit #1, the massive departure from crowdpleasing party music to half-tempo introversion pointed towards several imminent musical futures, and the wellspring of an auteur's brush with drug-damaged withdrawal resonated with everyone, sober or high, who saw their standing in the love-hangover 70s as something difficult to fight.</p>
<p>Tellingly, there's little rare material from the 70s on <i>Higher</i>, aside from the aforementioned Isle of Wight recordings, where Stone sounds a bit strained and pressured even as the rest of the band relentlessly caffeinates the early-morning festival crowd. (In his intro to “Stand!”, a deadpan-to-the-point-of-glazed Sly tries to get to the heart of the universal experience by stating that “it hurts if you step on my toe,” appending the least-pained reading of the word “ouch” you could imagine.) The later 70s<i> </i>work, particularly the material from 1973's <i>Fresh </i>and 1974's <i>Small Talk</i> that takes up most of the fourth disc's latter half, attemps to pull back from the fatigue, isolation, and bitterness that made <i>Riot </i>such a bracing work of genius and reconcile it with the more upbeat funk the Family Stone trafficked in at the end of the previous decade. It usually works-- “Time for Livin'”, “If You Want Me to Stay”, and “Skin I'm In” retrofit the cloistered claustrophobia of <i>Riot </i>with a bit more positive energy, and “Loose Booty” is a wholehearted embrace of big, boisterous, platform-soled funk excess that recalled the Family Stone of old.</p>
<p>But the band had already started to splinter noticeably by then-- Graham and Errico were out of the group before <i>Small Talk</i> came out, and by 1975's <i>High on You</i> Sly was releasing albums under his own billing. Cynthia Robinson was the only original member to stick around for the following year's Sly &amp; the Family Stone reboot <i>Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I'm Back </i>(note the pronouns), and cuts like the ironically titled “Family Again” didn't do much to help make it sound like just another second-rate funk record after a long catalogue with no shortage of the primo stuff. A couple mid-decade vault findings show glimpses of decent songcraft-- the uptempo organ-driven “Hoboken” makes Sly's complete inability to work well within the confines of disco that much more inexplicable, and “High” is a valiant stab at hitching a ride on the Mothership six years before he dropped in on Funkadelic's <i>The Electric Spanking of War Babies. </i>But it's more a coda of a career's prime than the beginning of another phase.</p>
<p>It's funny, though-- as a box set, <i>Higher </i>really does reinforce how creatively rich a band Sly &amp; the Family Stone were, while making it seem almost unbelievable that their peak only lasted seven years and seven albums. They feel a lot more enduring than that across the generations, whether or not you factor in their elder-statesman canonization and their status as a hip-hop sample goldmine. To modern ears, they're a better representative of their time than a lot of their omnipresent boomer-rock peers, largely because they're so much more complicated and caught up in working out the contradictions and dilemmas of their condition. They were sincere, but they were funny about it rather than hopelessly doe-eyed and naïve. They were catchy and pop-friendly, but capable of tendon-straining heaviness and unprecedented experimentation. They were idealistic about the potential to put all the bullshit aside, yet realistic enough to know what to do when that bullshit wasn't so easy to ignore.</p></div>"|18442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18442-sly-and-the-family-stone-higher/|9.0|Nate Patrin

That’s the translated title of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5187-vieux-farka-toure/"" target=""_blank"">Vieux Farka Touré</a>’s latest album. It refers to his homeland, Mali, and it is a more pointed and political title than it first appears to be. Since early 2012, Mali has been embroiled in a complex series of political crises and internal wars; briefly, an independence movement in the country’s vast northeast briefly succeeded and the government in Bamako was deposed in a coup. The northeastern independence movement faltered when Islamist fighters turned on the movement they’d supported, and ultimately foreign troops launched an offensive to drive them out.</p>
<p>If the Islamists had been allowed to consolidate power, one of their policies would have been to ban music. It’s hard to imagine Mali without its music, from the internationalist pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/247-amadou-mariam/"" target=""_blank"">Amadou &amp; Mariam</a> to the majestic dance band music of Rail Band and Les Ambassadeurs to the desert rock of Tartit and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5199-tinariwen/"" target=""_blank"">Tinariwen</a> to the guitar music of Touré’s father, Ali Farka Toure, to the dozens of traditional sounds found across the country, music is the face Mali presents most prominently to the world. To lose it, even in a part of the country, would be to lose a hugely important piece of the place’s identity.</p>
<p>Touré, who is a moderate Muslim, has openly decried the invaders who've hijacked his religion, and <i>Mon Pays</i> seems a conscious effort to wrap his arms around Mali and its many sounds to show how they can come together to make something coherent. His most important collaborator is kora player Sidiki Diabáte, son of Toumani Diabáte; their fathers made two excellent records together before Ali Farka Touré passed away, and it’s neat to hear the collaboration passed down to a new generation.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Where Touré’s records in the past have been electric and expansively international in their sound, this one is more focused on acoustic instrumentation outside of the electric bass, and traditional instruments such as kora and ngoni make appearances alongside his guitar. It all gives the recording an earthy, elemental feel that nicely supports Touré’s weary, weathered vocals.</p>
<p>The whole album is compulsively listenable, but in its final third, it reaches a height of intense beauty that the rest only hints at. This is highlighted by a pair of guitar/kora duets with Diabáte that sound as though they’ve existed for a million years and we’re just now having the privilege of hearing. It leads up to the haunting “Ay Bakoy”, which features Israeli pianist Idan Raichel; Raichel’s piano alternately flutters a bit like a kora and provides a heavy anchor in the left hand that no other song on the album quite has. The two artists have worked together before as the Touré-Raichel Collective; but the presence of an Israeli pianist on this album can’t help but feel like a bit of a finger in the eye of the fundamentalists whose attempt to rule the place of his birth was so narrowly averted.</p>
<p>How smoothly his homeland returns to peace remains to be seen, but if <i>Mon Pays</i> can be taken as evidence, Mali is in no danger of slipping from its perch in the global culture. Touré is well on his way to carving his own path out of the shadow of his father. His vision of how to build bridges between his own music and the music others is already his own, and <i>Mon Pays</i> puts it on brilliant display.</p></div>"|18431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18431-vieux-farka-toure-mon-pays/|8.0|Joe Tangari

Steinhardt has an enviable ear for developing talent, and in recent years, Don Giovanni's solidified itself as one of the most important indie labels going. Years back, Steinhardt played guitar for Jersey punkers For Science, and after their 2009 split, Steinhardt began writing and recording the songs that would become <i>Generic Treasure</i>, Modern Hut's Don Giovanni debut. <i>Generic Treasure</i> is a sparse, straightforward anti-folk record in the vein of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14772-jeffrey-lewis/"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Lewis</a> (now a DG signee) or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1227-kimya-dawson/"" target=""_blank"">Kimya Dawson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1817-adam-green/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Green</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2805-the-moldy-peaches/"" target=""_blank"">Moldy Peaches</a>. It's a personal record in almost every sense of the word, an unadorned address from performer to listener. Modern Hut finds Steinhardt laying his weary, lonesome, cynical self out there, all but daring you to take him as he is.</p>
<p>Produced by Screaming Females' Marissa Paternoster, the rickety <i>Generic Treasure</i> feels less like a proper LP (some six years in the making, as Steinhardt suggets) than a home-recorded demo. Apart from the occasional single-string accouterment and Paternoster's overpowering vocal turn on duet ""Life"", Modern Hut is little more than Steinhardt, a couple bumbling chords, and his overwhelming unease with both himself and the world around him. ""Life's been so mid-tempo these days,"" Steinhardt sings right at the top of <i>Generic Treasure</i>, ""and I don't even know what I am trying to say."" Later, he asks his guitar to ""shut the fuck up,"" wonders if he was born ""without a taste for life,"" admits his ""brain is to capacity with someone else's stupid dream."" It's sobering stuff, the product of a troubled mind working things out over a few shaky strums, taking self-examination to uncomfortable, often unflattering places. ""Well, I finally stopped drinking,"" Steinhardt lets slip, ""but what I can't stop is this negative thinking."" So it would seem.</p>
<p>Steinhardt, no fan of dressing up his feelings in metaphor, starts roughly 80% of Modern Hut's lyrics with either ""I"" or ""my."" Coupled with his close-miced vocals and the barely-there arrangements, this approach invites you right into Steinhardt's head, a place he's made as uninviting as possible. Steinhardt seems to have to drag himself through these songs, sluggishly strumming through the simple chord progressions, glumly intoning the lyrics with only a passing regard for pitch. Steinhardt's voice is laconic, faintly adenoidal, both tiring and just plain tired. He makes constant reference to his crushing self-doubt, to mistakes from the past and fuck-ups waiting to happen, without the slightest hint of levity.</p>
<p>Between the amateurish music (however willful) and the sulking lyrics (however honestly Steinhardt comes by those feelings), <i>Generic Treasure</i> doesn't always seem to care about itself very much, which leaves one wondering why Steinhardt would've thought anybody else might've.<i> </i>It's not meant to be an easy listen, but even at 28 minutes, it's a slog, musically drab and lyrically disheartening, a Debbie Downer sketch that refuses to end. There's never any resolution to all this whinging, nor much in the way of insight: Steinhardt just seems to consider himself beyond repair. But within a few songs, his self-laceration becomes a sort of self-obsession; he may not like himself much, yet he's still his own favorite subject. He's certainly good at letting you know about his problems, he never quite makes himself sympathetic enough to get you to care.</p>
<p>On the rare occasions Steinhardt pull back the camera enough to focus on something other than himself, <i>Generic Treasure</i> finds its voice. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15575-modern-hut-history/"" target=""_blank"">""History""</a> finds Steinhardt calling out ""a nation of overnight sensations where irony was currency,"" a biting jab at the kind of shrugged-off, feelings-averse indie rock scene Steinhardt finds himself in the middle of. The laid-bare self-examination Steinhardt offers up throughout <i>Generic Treasure</i> is an increasingly rare quality in modern music, and Steinhardt's right to bemoan this lack of feeling, this escape from honesty. Yet <i>Generic Treasure</i>-- uncompromising but ultimately wearisome-- hardly seems like the antidote. Out in the real world, Steinhardt's a shrewd guy with a lot going for him: he runs a great label, he'll soon have a Ph.D, and he's tight with Marissa Paternoster. But the Steinhardt who made <i>Generic Treasure</i> comes off as a guy far too stuck in his own head to get himself into yours.</p></div>"|18375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18375-modern-hut-generic-treasure/|4.0|Paul Thompson

Stinger|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Drag City']|2013-08-29 00:00:00|2013|2016-06-11 16:53:46.123439|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".21s9i62izuo.1.6:0.1.0.$18422/=1$18422.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>There’s something exciting about a rock band playing tight and sharp without sounding like they’re wearing straitjackets. Bleeding outside lines without losing sight of them gives any music extra juice-- especially when that music is punk or post-punk, where blurring rules is often the point. Sometimes it’s just about having a reckless singer: think of the way Darby Crash slobbers over <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germs_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Germs’</a> chords, Mark E. Smith rants upstream of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall’s</a> repetitions, or David Yow grunts and hacks through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">the Jesus Lizard’s</a> rubber-band dynamics.</p>
<p>Without that vocal variable, a band can still hit a sweet spot between tautness and sloppiness, but it’s tougher. One way is to play with so much muscle and adrenaline that the music bulges and tears at the seams. It’s a solution common to a bunch of 80s Australian post-punk bands-- groups with aptly guttural names like Fungus Brains, Sick Things, and People With Chairs Up Their Noses. My favorite was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30285-feedtime/"">feedtime</a>, who stretched punk by grinding it into a heavy, air-sucking marsh. Not far behind were Venom P. Stinger, a quartet who could sound as weighty as feedtime, but preferred quicker tempos and slightly more standard songs.</p>
<p>The emphasis there is on slightly, because Venom P. Stinger’s take on punk was far from middle of the road. Most of their tunes began with a simple beat and a few chords, but soon revved into noisier, wilder territory. This was due in part to the singing of ex-Sick Thing Dugald McKenzie, a fiery chanter who could veer off course when the moment demanded it. But most of the band’s unruliness came from two elements: the slashing, spilling guitar of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4311-mick-turner/"">Mick Turner</a>, and the shuffling percussion of Jim White, who managed to make drum rolls sound like punk beats. (Not coincidentally, the pair went on to expand these styles as part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"">the Dirty Three</a>).</p>
<p>This new compilation<i> 1986-1991 </i>collects Venom P. Stinger’s first four releases-- two LPs, a 7-inch, and an EP-- spotlighting a band for whom energy and insanity were much higher priorities than melody. Not that the songs didn’t have some strong semi-hooks. But there’s not a ton of melodic variance between tracks, which makes them less memorable as songs than as visceral experiences. After the dust settles, what echoes loudest is the vicious, sometimes daring power of the quartet’s workout-like performances.</p>
<p>Venom P. Stinger’s songs did get catchier as they made more of them, though. Their 1986 debut LP <i>Meet My Friend Venom </i>is a marvel of primal thrust, tearing through the air so forcefully you often feel like you’re just catching its smoke trails. But on 1990’s <i>What’s Yours is Mine</i>,<i> </i>some hooks begin to creep in-- albeit ones that feel just as fleeting amidst the band’s high-octane assault. Even relatively mid-tempo tunes like the lumbering “Those Snakes” and the swaying “Pressure Inside” sound as urgent as their more frantic jams. By the time of 1991’s <i>Waiting Room </i>EP, things had become even more streamlined, with no loss of urgency. Turner in particular learned to play more melodically without abandoning his loose, impulsive attack.</p>
<p><i>Waiting Room </i>was the final release for the first version of Venom P. Stinger (they reunited a few years later with a different singer), so their time was pretty short. But their influence is detectable since-- see the noise-punk of <a href=""http://www.amphetaminereptile.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amphetamine Reptile</a> bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22316-halo-of-flies/"">Halo of Flies,</a> some of the more rock-damaged stuff on <a href=""http://www.loadrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Load Records</a>, and recent Aussie bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28433-eddy-current-suppression-ring/"">Eddy Current Suppression Ring</a> and <a href=""http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/releases/sbr046/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slug Guts</a>. Perhaps their music is ultimately for punk diehards seeking deviations from the genre’s norms. But if you’re inclined that way at all, it doesn’t get much better than this.</p></div>"|18422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18422-venom-p-stinger-1986-1991/|7.3|Marc Masters

And they did so by embodying the very values that the internet would eventually displace: patience, privacy, scarcity. To be a Belle and Sebastian fan in North America was to play armchair detective, whether it was gleaning personal details about a band that never appeared in publicity photos or granted interviews, or simply trying to track down their records in your local music shop’s import bin. It was a situation that came about partially by choice (the band’s 1996 debut <i>Tigermilk</i> was famously limited to a first run of just 1,000 copies), partially by circumstance (with their first U.S. label the Enclave going belly up just as 1997’s <i>If You’re Feeling Sinister</i> was making waves Stateside). But what made Belle and Sebastian such a joy to discover was not just the fact they emerged seemingly out of nowhere with a fully realized sense of songcraft, a self-contained narrative universe populated by first-name-basis characters, and a cryptic (if unabashedly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">Smiths</a>-indebted) visual aesthetic, but that there was a helluva lot more where that came from. The band’s first two albums washed ashore alongside a trio of equally top-notch, equally hard-to-find EPs that felt less like spillover releases than stand-alone works in their own right that subtly expanded the band’s musical scope while deepening their sense of mystique.</p>
<p>That moment now seems so very long ago. With Stuart Murdoch csharing the songwriting reins with his bandmates, the post-millennial Belle and Sebastian have turned both less prolific yet more accessible, more physical but also more frivolous. And while the records they’ve released since have lacked the pen-pal intimacy of their earliest efforts (they’ve gone from initiating <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slwc8M9KwAw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inside-baseball commentary on zine culture</a> to writing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzjYRWRKb_Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">songs about actual baseball players</a>), Belle and Sebastian have eagerly adapted to the digital-age gig economy by focusing on its road game: A band that once seemed like it would sooner enter the Witness Protection Program than face the public started touring regularly, taking requests, and hosting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw0nJV8YwyQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">onstage dance parties</a>. But in the process, Belle and Sebastian have more or less abandoned the EP format as an organizing principle, instead issuing non-album tracks as B-sides to singles from their full-lengths-- with all the remixes and throwaways that tack implies. Where the 2005 compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/637-push-barman-to-open-old-wounds/"" target=""_blank""><i>Push Barman to Open Old Wounds</i></a> rounded up the band’s entire 1997-2001 EP output into a two-disc 26-song package-- presenting each extended-player in complete, chronological sequence-- <i>The Third Eye Centre</i> cobbles together a cherry-picked sampling of post-2003 rarities in randomized order. </p>
<p>It’s an odd approach for a band that’s put so much effort into proper album presentation, but one that’s reflective of the more freewheeling nature of their post-2000 records. The formative influences-- classic country, northern soul, baroque psychedelia, glam rock, 70s easy-listening pop-- that once drifted subliminally and seamlessly through their early work came to the fore and codified into discrete, often-winking genre exercises. And on <i>The Third Eye Centre</i>, you get the oddball attempts that were deemed too lightweight for placement on the already frothy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/633-dear-catastrophe-waitress/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/639-the-life-pursuit/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Life Pursuit</i></a>: “Last Trip” and “Stop, Look, and Listen” gussy up age-old B&amp;S themes of romantic longing in more droll, cornball-country dressing; “Mr. Richard” sees Stevie Jackson make an ill-advised attempt at calypso patois. By contrast, the smoky ska of “The Eighth Station of the Kebab House” finds Murdoch wading into the murky waters of Middle Eastern geopolitics-- weaving a tale that’s sympathetic both to the displaced Palestinian worker and the Israeli checkpoint solder obliged to frisk him-- but the hushed, conspiratorial tones with which he imparts the lyrics add an unnecessary layer of contrivance. </p>
<p>Compared to the self-mythologizing narratives that lent Belle and Sebastian’s 90s output a timeless, fantastical quality, Murdoch’s more topical, contemporary concerns root some of this material firmly in the aughts. (By the time the skinny-tied power pop of “Suicide Girl” surfaced as a <i>Write About Love</i> bonus track in 2010, the emo-porn website was already a good five years and several scandals removed from its moment as an internet phenomenon.) You can also trace origin dates by the band's choice of remixers: the radical reworking of “I’m a Cuckoo”-- which situates the<i> Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i> highlight inside the namesake type of clock-- bears the idiosyncratic imprimatur of once-vanguard, now-dormant beat scientists the Avalanches; <i>Write About Love</i>’s winsome, wallflowery opener “I Didn’t See It Coming” gets a New Orderly overhaul from electro-pop practitioner du jour Richard X, translating the song’s yearning chorus line-- “make me dance/ I want to surrender”-- into wish fulfillment. The album’s other key remix forges an even more explicit extrapoloation of lyrics into sonics. In lieu of 2004’s multi-sectional masterpiece “Your Cover’s Blown”-- the band’s hands-down best non-album track of the past decade-- we get a jacked-up previously unreleased reworking by Scottish producer Miaoux Miaoux that heightens the intensity of Murdoch’s dancefloor panic attack (the migrane-inducing happy-hardcore oscillations practically taunt him as he sings, “the DJ’s picking up speed/ That’s something I just don’t need”), while greatly increasing Belle and Sebastian’s chances of getting booked at the next HARD Festival.</p>
<p>As a band that started out singing in the secret codes of clubhouse confidantes, Belle and Sebastian are fully aware of how their shifting stylistic course and more aggressively crowd-pleasing mode of performance may alienate those long-serving fans who’d prefer they still communicate in whispers. And some of the best songs here knowingly allude to that dynamic: Jackson’s plaintive piano ballad “I Took a Long Hard Look” is an affecting admission of feeling disconnected from those you once considered heroes, while Murdoch’s “Your Secrets” is a sly slice of folk-funk that juggles the comforts of insularity and the desire for more open dialogue. After being told he’s “introspective to a fault,” Murdoch errs on the side of assertiveness: “You could tell me all your secrets/ All you want to do is run and hide/ You keep it inside.” Rather than shroud themselves in mystery, Belle and Sebastian would rather blow their own cover and, for all its inherent inconsistencies, <i>The Third Eye Centre</i> provides a clear view of how a band that once made music fit for a library is now more liable to get kicked out of one.</p></div>"|18413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18413-belle-and-sebastian-the-third-eye-centre/|7.2|Stuart Berman

It’s possible that you may also know him as an MPC jockey who builds beats from scratch in front of a live audience with the same kind of hyperactive energy.</span></p>
<p>Neither experience is much of an indicator of what to expect from <i>Tough Love</i>, the short-ish first proper album from Party Supplies, which has expanded into a duo with the addition of multi-instrumentalist Sean Mann. Loose-limbed rap beats and frenetic improvisation are in short supply here. Instead, Nealis has decided to unveil another musical identity: the slightly sensitive electropop singer-songwriter.</p>
<p>In one fell swoop, he's put himself at considerable risk of alienating the not-insignificant fan base his beats have attracted, while also entering the crowded electropop market, whose product is being steadily devalued by a seemingly endless procession of knockoff Phoenixes. It’s a risky maneuver, but against all odds, Nealis has pulled it off. Earnest, emotional records with dancefloor aspirations are a dime a dozen in 2013, but few of them work as effectively as <i>Tough Love</i>. It turns out that behind all of the pranky YouTube rips and Guns N’ Roses flips, Nealis is not only a more flexible producer than expected, he’s actually a songwriter of considerable skill and subtlety, not to mention a surprisingly decent vocalist.</p>
<p><i>Tough Love</i>’s influences are broad and easy to spot. It borrows rhythms from old disco and house records, the plastic-y synthesized sounds of 80s pop, and even a little bit of hair metal in the title song’s drums. Several tracks follow the same dynamic shape that his labelmates like A-Trak and Flosstradamus use to make arena-worthy EDM.</p>
<p>But mostly Nealis seems to draw his inspiration from the evolutionary line of artists blending pop with serious dance music that begins somewhere around <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads </a>and runs all the way through contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"" target=""_blank"">Chromeo</a>, and, yes, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"">Phoenix</a>. Like his predecessors, Nealis has found a balance between dance music’s rhythmic focus and pop’s melodic requirements, one that leans a little more heavily on melody’s side-- none of <i>Tough Love</i>’s nine tracks are difficult to imagine in an electronics-free arrangement. And also like his forebears, his best songs combine dance music’s ecstatic qualities with a sense of urgent yearning, expressed in vocal parts that glide over the eddies that their stomping backing tracks propulsively kick up. It’s the type of thing you can find yourself singing along to without knowing it.</p>
<p>Despite the dramatic change in direction and mood, <i>Tough Love</i> still sounds essentially like a Party Supplies record. The songs are more carefully considered and arranged than <i>Blue Chips</i>, and a world away stylistically, but you can still identify Nealis’ quirks in the way he places sounds against each other, the odd near-subliminal jokes (like sampling David Lee Roth’s isolated vocals from “Running With the Devil” on “Cherry Valley”), and in the slightly grimy lo-fi sonic aura that surrounds even the most straight-up pop cuts.</p>
<p>In a July interview with the rap blog <a href=""http://nahright.com/news/in-the-lab-party-supplies-talks-blue-chips-2-and-upcoming-solo-album/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nah Right</a>,<span> Nealis described <i>Tough Love</i> as having “a few hit songs” on it. It’s not a humble statement, but it may not be inaccurate. There are a few tracks here-- <span>“</span>New York 2017”, “Going Back to New York”, and “Touching Your Face”-- that sound like hits already, the type of thing that you’ll hear in a DJ set at a club, then put on again when you get home, and hear again at the coffee shop the next day. The songs on <i>Tough Love</i> may be aimed at the dance floor, but they’re designed to creep into every aspect of your listening. It’s easy to let them.</span></p></div>"|18501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18501-party-supplies-tough-love/|7.4|Miles Raymer

Shigeto’s newest album, <i>No Better Time Than Now</i> combines these separate facets into a single sound, though it’s often easy to identify the dominant mode with which Saginaw is working.</p>
<p>Typically, the more well-blended Shigeto’s influences, the better the result. The standout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15593-shigeto-detroit-part-1/"" target=""_blank"">""Detroit Part 1""</a> is the best example: it's an intricately plotted track on which shifts in tone and texture build a small world within a manner of minutes. The album’s title track, also, uses well-chosen details to advance a narrative, granting it a sense of purpose which climaxes beautifully with a series of well chosen instrumental flourishes. These tracks take lessons from hip-hop and bass music, creating structures which allow Saginaw’s lighter touches to flourish.</p>
<p>Those light touches are often exquisite: beauty is something of a Shigeto specialty. Several of the tracks here, though somewhat formless, are simply too pretty to ignore. “Miss You” uses a warm, full synth to imbue a diffuse track with some soul. And the shuffling “Safe in Here,” opts for sublety, with tonal ornamentation in its back half making up for a lack of direction at its outset.</p>
<p>“Safe in Here,” points at the largest problem on <i>Better Time</i>-- and it’s a problem common to Matthewdavid-style beat music. Tracks too often lose their way, and the listener’s attention along with it. The worst of the tracks here seem almost arbitrary, with randomly chosen loops that don’t fit in with the more in-depth miniatures that the record has to offer. “Ritual Howl"", as if to spite its own name, is a barely-there chime loop which doesn’t make much of an impression.  Ditto “Soul Searching"", which sounds, for the entirety of its running time, as if it’s actually searching for that essential, memorable moment of levity. The lack of structure is confusing, given that Saginaw came up as a drummer, and obviously understands the importance of percussion in buttressing the melodies above. </p>
<p>Though Shigeto has absorbed a host of positive qualities from his fellow beatmakers, he seems caught, between a more purposeful, narrative form of music (like that of Four Tet, and the calmer compositions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>) and the abstruse, diffuse form that’s endorsed by the Leaving Records camp. As the best tracks on <i>No Better Time Than Now</i> show, Saginaw has more than enough talent to pull off the former with aplomb-- a style of music-making that will force him to focus and propel his sound forward. Someone who’s shown the ability to shape such intricate moments of beauty should be able to make music that consistently provides something more than just a passive experience. </p></div>"|18441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18441-shigeto-no-better-time-than-now/|6.4|Jonah Bromwich

Their debut LP <i>Feast of Love </i>is post-coital pop-punk, far enough removed from the physical act where any intimacy or legitimate emotional connection has given way to the neediness and self-loathing that drove these poor souls to pursue their couplings in the first place. And of course, they're saddled with the additional depression of realizing that another person isn’t going to fix them; in fact, it always makes it worse. <i>Feast of Love, </i>sure. But the whole affair just makes Pity Sex kinda sick to their stomach.</p>
<p>That much is conveyed on “Wind-Up”, where Brennan Greaves demands space to nurse an incapacitating hangover or the fact that he just <i>cannot fucking deal right now</i>. Hell, maybe he just woke up still drunk, as there’s an illicit giddiness to “Wind-Up”; ripping through their most anthemic riffs and a righteous fuzz solo, Pity Sex are having a blast here, even though Greaves' droopy vocals try to tell a different story. His counterpart Britty Drake isn’t much better off on the subsequent “Keep”, where a surprising melodic (mis)step occurs in the tipsy chorus, possibly because she’s too despondent to reach the next higher note in the scale. The two have about equal billing here, though <i>Feast of Love</i> doesn’t sound like a concept album or a back and forth conversation. When Greaves and Drake trade verses on the acrid “Drown Me Out”, it's a standoff between two friends who might be getting a little sick <b>of</b> telling each other about their failed romances as well as hearing about them. Misery loves company on <i>Feast of Love, </i>but it also wants some damn space.</p>
<p>Which makes a lot of sense-- after all, <i>Feast of Love </i>is a record of limited scope, to put it lightly. It’s also limited to 10 songs and 28 minutes, so it never has the opportunity to get too oppressive. Plus, the music itself could not be more adept at channeling Pity Sex’s particular brand of hangdog horniness-- melodic and punchy enough to be attractive, rumpled and lethargic enough to let you know it's not trying too hard…which in turn makes it <i>more </i>attractive depending on your tastes. The distinctions are incremental on <i>Feast of Love </i>and even after so many listens, I’m still taken aback by how ""Fold"" makes no concession to being a grand finale, ending the LP with zero fanfare. Within the record's narrow musical arc, “Hollow Body” establishes itself as the “ballad” by ditching the drums and distortion, while the whammy-bar abuse on “Drawstring” sonically embodies the masochism of the lyrics-- ""Your name is a a drawstring around my neck/ tighter with every breath."" And while happiness appears to be comically unattainable on <i>Feast of Love, </i>at least there’s ownership of one’s misery on “Honey Pot”, where Greaves snarks, ""I'll take what I want/ I'll concede to all my faults...I won't feel guilty when you kiss me.""</p>
<p>Though not as lyrically sharp as either <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee"">Waxahatchee</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz"">Speedy Ortiz</a> and more affiliated with pop-punk despite its shoegazy alt-rock leanings, <i>Feast of Love </i>is a record that finds Pity Sex as part of an uninentional ""moment"" for slack, sexualized indie rock. So the initial temptation is to think of it as reactionary-- is it possible that these bands are interested in a reclamation of 90s indie rock ideals at a time when “indie rock” rarely means “guitar rock” and deals with the actual, mundane mechanics of relationships even more rarely? Doubtful. Judging from their unsurprisingly active Twitter feeds, none of the aforementioned appear the least bit interested in being scolds. Nor do I think an album like <i>Feast of Love </i>is a <i>reaction </i>to the countless thinkpieces about how the <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2143001,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-involvement of 20-somethings</a> or the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/fashion/the-end-of-courtship.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">romantic complications caused by technology</a> somehow didn’t exist before 2013. Nah, but it is a nice refutation of both, and though every sound on <i>Feast of Love </i>existed before the end of the first Clinton term, Pity Sex's tales<i> </i>are as timeless as the band’s name-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ImRyPymRAM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-pitying people are still having sex and nothing seems to stop them</a>. </p></div>"|18502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18502-pity-sex-feast-of-love/|7.0|Ian Cohen

Her association with Brown only lasted for three years-- she walked out alongside most of the Famous Flames in 1970, prompting Brown to form the J.B.’s-- but her output as a member of the Godfather’s revue during that brief time proved both fertile and enduring. In particular, her 1968 singles “Unwind Yourself” and “What Do I Have to Do to Prove My Love to You” showed just how punchy the Kansas City native could be when paired with strong tracks of sinewy (and often speedy) funk. It took The J.B.’s’ “Female Preacher” Lyn Collins to replace Whitney in 1970 and that speaks volumes about the size of the hole Whitney left in Brown’s roster.</p>
<p><i>The Forte Label</i>-- the latest archival anthology in Numero Group’s consistently superb Eccentric Soul series-- brings up the question, “What did Whitney do next?” The short answer: She kept on rocking. After her relationship with Brown crumbled, her marriage to singer Harry Whitney ended in divorce. Back in Kansas City, she remarried, and her new husband Ellis Taylor would help her usher in the next phase of her career at his label Forte Records. Small R&amp;B labels in the 60s and 70s weren’t just typically regional-- they were often family affairs. Such was the case with Forte. With Ellis orchestrating a string of 45s tied to the platform his wife had built beside Brown, Whitney dropped the greatest single of her post-“Soul Sister No. 1” career: “Daddy Don’t Know About My Sugar Bear"". Cut from the same cloth of saucy adultery as Candi Staton’s output at the time, the song opens with a piercing squeal unmatched by any singer of the era save for Alfreda Brockington on her ear-cleansing “Your Love Has Got Me Chained and Bound"". Tuneful, compact, and ringing with passion, “Daddy Don’t Know” is a raw yet infectious funk track that’s still as hard and bright and the gems she made with Brown.</p>
<p>The compilation amply demonstrates, Ellis’ eye for talent was as keenly ambitious as it was devotedly KC-centric. That led to standout cuts from Lee Harris-- whose “I Am Gonna Get Your Thing” siphons Johnnie Taylor’s percolating sexiness-- to the Hot Wax-esque funk-pop of “You Confuse Me Baby” by the girl group the Rayons. Beyond that, Ellis lined up the doo-wop-inflected “I’m Gonna Get You” by the Tear Drops, which could be mistaken for an early-60s R&amp;B classic if not for the tight, shuffling, near-funk snare. Louis Chachere’s “The Hen Part 1” is pure, greasy, orgasmic organ-pounding, and Tony Ashley’s “All Along I’ve Loved You” clocks in with the collection’s only ballad-- although it’s a tender, sensuous slow-burner of the Jerry Butler variety. Even the label’s day-late-dollar-short stab at disco-- 1980’s sinuously sultry “Reaching For Our Star” by Sharon Revoal-- shines, thanks to minimal production and an endearingly twinkly jazz-fusion vamp.</p>
<p>Regardless of the fire, fun, grit, and eclecticism of Forte’s roster, the label failed to break through nationally. The occasionally flashes of anachronism in Ellis’ taste might have had something to do with that but mostly that was symptomatic of a larger problem. Ellis followed instead of led, and because of that hesitance he was never able to fully capitalize on his biggest star: Whitney. In addition to “Daddy Don’t Know"", she contributes three other singles to the anthology, and two of them under her new married name Marva W. Taylor, “Nothing I’d Rather Be (Than Your Weakness)” and “I’ve Lived The Life"". Her most bankable marketing asset at the time-- “Marva Whitney” in bold letters on the face of her 45s-- was gone. Her voice remained, but with little radio play outside KC, that wasn’t going to do much good, at least not success-wise. Artistically, these songs still slam; in particular, “I’ve Lived the Life” is a poignant downshift in Whitney’s funky bluster in which she struts her hard-won wisdom over a sauntering, bad-girl beat.</p>
<p>On the disc’s final song, though, she sounds bruised, if not defeated, on “We Need More (But Somebody Gotta Sacrifice)"". A novelty-leaning, call-and-response song reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5721-otis-redding/"" target=""_blank"">Otis Redding</a>’s and Carla Thomas’ “Tramp,” the song is Ellis’ only vocal appearance on the collection. He uses that opportunity to scold Whitney for wanting too much out of life, not tightening her belt enough, and lamenting his own poor fortunes as a would-be impresario. “What are you gonna be?/ What are you gonna sacrifice?” he asks her over a chugging track of bargain-basement funk. Her valiantly spirited response: “I need more/ You need more/ Everybody need a little bit more.” As the song fades out, she can be heard rattling off lines that sounds ad-libbed: “I’m trying to hold up… I just can’t hold up to the pressure too long.” In the 80s, Whitney wound up putting her career on hold where it stayed, despite occasional mini-comebacks, until her death. The history of funk has long needed a little bit more of Marva Whitney; her music, her context, her soul. Thanks to <i>The Forte Label</i>, we now have it. And then some.</p></div>"|18440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18440-eccentric-soul-the-forte-label/|8.2|Jason Heller

So singular, in fact, that the task of creating a worthy follow-up must have seemed daunting, which I assumed was why it took him a while. It turns out there were other reasons-- for one, he suffered from hearing problems that made his new work sound different with each listen, and forced him to consider ending Forest Swords. But also, in keeping with his music’s slow-growing vibe, he was wary of rushing things. As he admitted in a February <a href=""http://www.sevenstreets.com/21840/forest-swords-dyymond-of-durham-liverpool-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, “I’m glad I took a step back…I’ve seen so many bands who strike while the iron’s hot and then burn out.”</p>
<p>Barnes’ judgment proved sound, as did his ears, at least in their ability to assess his work. Created at his own pace in his own home in North West England, <i>Engravings </i>is the perfect sequel to <i>Dagger Paths</i>. Barnes steadfastly retains his sturdy loops, simple beats, and evocative guitar lines, refusing to overhaul his potent formula just to dodge accusations that he’s repeating himself. But he also gradually inserts new sounds into that equation, fitting them snugly into his songs’ accumulating layers. The result is both familiar and fresh, cementing Barnes’ knack for creating complex effects with elementary methods.</p>
<p><i>Engravings </i>also confirms his ability to conjure more than just a chilly, faded-memory vibe. <i>Dagger Paths </i>did that too, but it was easy to get lost in its burned-out echo and miss other ideas and moods that Barnes explored along the way. Here, those diverse facets of his music are unavoidable. Every song is boldly sensual, and each note has a distinct emotional hue. Mixing that intensity with dream-like atmospheres lands <i>Engravings </i>in a unique emotional space, one Barnes accurately describes as a “balance between really intense euphoria and this almost bleakness.”</p>
<p>Trying to balance those opposites could produce disjointed, even jarring art. But one of the biggest strengths of Forest Swords’ music is its fluidity. Although Barnes adds and subtracts loops and beats without hiding the seams, he persistently maintains a DJ-like flow. As a result, following the curving path of his melodies feels more like riding a wave than cutting through choppy waters. So even a track as spliced together as “Onward”-- which opens with a stuttering clang, grafts on glittering guitar, then drifts into strings and a pounding beat-- feels completely logical, as if this is the only way time could march on.</p>
<p>Barnes’ strong sense of flow lets him add new twists to his sound without forcing them in. Often they emerge sneakily, like the radio-static transmissions in “Ljoss”, the New Age piano on “Gathering”, the horn-section accents in “An Hour”, or the near-militaristic beat of ecstatic closer “Friend, You Will Never Learn”. In other places, these additions are clearer, but they’re always well-suited to their environment, as if Barnes had no other choice but to include them in his mix.</p>
<p>That’s especially true of the increased amount of singing on <i>Engravings</i>. The majority of it comes from Barnes’ own voice, which he sampled and then edited down to a nearly molecular level. This digital abstraction of the music’s most human element gives <i>Engravings</i> subliminal warmth, as if the ghosts of long-dead lyrics are watching over the songs. At times, vocals even become the focus: “Gathering” is nothing but overlapped singing for its first half, and the inclusion of Brighton-based vocalist <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/annekamusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anneka</a> on “Anneka’s Battle” adds vivid soul to Barnes’ brand of negative-space R&amp;B.</p>
<p>Barnes inviting a guest onto a Forest Swords song<i> i</i>s a bit surprising. His one-man music is usually a personal affair: you can practically hear him thinking through the songs as they unfold, and all the reverb and atmosphere make them feel like internal monologues. But compared to <i>Dagger Paths</i>, there’s more acknowledgement of the external world on <i>Engravings</i>. Barnes incorporates field recordings and refers to his locale in song titles; he also mixed the entire album on his laptop while sitting outside. Opening his process up a bit to include his environment perhaps explains how music this skeletal can sound like it has so much blood coursing through it.</p>
<p>It also explains how the one-man world of Forest Swords can feel so universal. Unrestricted by words or verse-chorus structures, Barnes’ songs reflect the way life can feel like an endless loop, growing and building without ever losing its cyclical nature. Maybe that’s why, even though Forest Swords’ sound skirts an array of genres, it doesn’t belong to any single one. Barnes’ work is less concerned with trends or scenes than experiences and memories that everyone has had, regardless of what music they’ve listened to before. On that count, <i>Engravings </i>is a broad success.</p></div>"|18401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18401-forest-swords-engravings/|8.5|Marc Masters

Though Reimer doesn’t play on <i>Carrier, </i>he’s a spiritual and musical inspiration that guides Meric Long and Logan Kroeber throughout, an incorporeal third member that still holds the most influence over the record’s direction. The short time in Reimer’s presence has shaken the band to its core and, understandably, <i>Carrier </i>isn’t always steady. But while it’s Dodos least immediate work, it lingers and resonates in ways that give it a unique place in their discography, a promising path forward rather than what can initially be heard as a return to <i>Time to Die</i>’s soft-focus indie pop.</p>
<p>The most noticeable superficial difference on <i>Carrier </i>is that Long has switched almost entirely to playing electric guitar. Surprising, but not sacrilege-- though Dodos broke out on <i>Visiter </i>as an acoustic-and-drums duo and returned to that format on <i>No Color</i>, they’re not wedded to that setup, having incorporated electric guitars in a live setting and even a full-time vibraphonist on <i>Time to Die. </i>The strange thing is that they might be the first band to ever plug in for the sole purpose of rocking <i>less. </i>On prior singles such as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brGHyx163pg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Fools”</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11388-fables/"">“Fables”</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12097-black-night/"">“Black Night”</a>, Long played his acoustic with force and resourcefulness, utilizing the resonance in alternate tunings, inverted chords and string buzz and sending the signal through looping and distortion pedals. He’s not as focused on multiplicity here, neatly lacing together pinging, high notes rather than chords or riffs. You can sense a tentativeness in the shift towards a gentler minimalism-- both the first song (“Transformer”) and the first single (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15466-confidence/"">“Confidence”</a>) begin as calm and quiet meditations, Long singing in a hushed, lower range over sprightly fingerpicking before giving way to the kind of percussive jams that we’ve come to expect. But those sections end up feeling mismatched and you sense that while Dodos were ready to do away with their old habits, they couldn’t quite figure out how to replace them.</p>
<p>Wedged in between those songs are rewarding mergers of their new approach with their old skills. The crisp production and autumnal glow of <i>Carrier </i>is a world away from Women’s meat-locker severity, though Reimer’s stylistic tics as a guitarist manifests in tangible ways. There’s a dissonant, deconstructive edge to the gnarled riff and fractious rhythms driving “Substance”, and the momentum makes for a seamless transition towards the tumbling chorus and a surprising brass section. “Stranger” similarly aligns Long’s tuneful folk-pop harmonies with tensile post-punk arrangements, as silvery palm-muted loops, pitch-shifted guitars and Kroeber’s unorthodox percussive clatter encase the delicate melodic core in steely armor.</p>
<p>The instrumental pyrotechnics of “Stranger” are a rare pleasure here and the combustion can be missed, as the energy exerted by Long and Kroeber as instrumentalists often <i>was </i>the hook on past records, rather than a certain melody or lyric. It’s an understandable loss, as the songwriting process has been completely inverted.<i> </i>Whereas previous records evolved out of instrumental jams, the lyrics on <i>Carrier </i>came first. But much like the six-string switch-up, it has the exact opposite effect of you might expect. Long hasn’t become a wordier or more poetic lyricist, in fact, <i>Carrier </i>is Dodos’ most plainspoken album. There seems to be a “first thought, best thought” approach as he asks cosmic, open-ended questions that strike to the heart of the human experience or sensible, legible fragments that can fleshed out over equally inquisitive music.</p>
<div>“What does a song hold?/ Was it love?,” Long asks to open the record and there’s no impatience or pedantry in it. <i>Carrier </i>instead has a quiet fortitude, searching for “substance, out of reach,” to use a phrase that pops up on two separate songs. To get there, Long occasionally reaches into the past, as on the station wagon reminiscence “Family”. More often, he’s just trying to be a better actor in the present. He’s a concerned father at the beginning of the heart-welling ""Relief"", and a consolate husband at the end-- ""So I sit with my wife/ thinking of nothing much when we fight/ and I squeeze till we dry.""  <i>Carrier’s </i>final stretch gets a bit too wispy, but not before the suitably titled “The Current” delivers the lyric that feels like the record’s valedictory address: “If this love comes unto me/ I’m with it.”</div>
<p>So despite the role Reimer’s passing played in the creation of <i>Carrier</i>, it’s not Dodos’ answer to <i>Tonight’s the Night</i>-- it never feels haunted or wracked with morbid reflection, even the supposedly blunt “Death” is imbued with a sense of gratitude, seeing the natural order of things.<i> </i>Though Long claimed “we put our backs into this one” in an email to fans, it doesn't convey that force and struggle on the listener, subtly getting under your skin by pairing Dodos' slightest music with their heaviest emotions. A key lyric here is from “Substance”, where Long shouts “you will forget and I will remember,” and summarizes the wistful effect of <i>Carrier </i>when faced with the passage of time and the fragility of memory<i>-- </i>it’s the kind of record for the times when you’re lost in thought about someone you might’ve known for a little while, wondering where they are and if they ever think about you.</p></div>"|18384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18384-the-dodos-carrier/|6.8|Ian Cohen

A quick image search confirmed my every suspicion: Flaamingos aren't the smiling kind. The LA duo's self-titled debut is steely, stone-faced, black-coffee-and-cigarette music. Between the hissing synths, the icepick guitars, the rattling drum machines and the baritone desperation, Flaamingos' grey pallored gloom-rock is somewhere in the same shadowy neighborhood of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a>, or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen/"" target=""_blank"">Echo and the Bunnymen</a> songs you never hear on the radio. Frontman Jerry Narrows sings-- moans, really-- of ""sick salvation,"" of ""wrestling a ghost,"" of ""Fractured Love"" and ""Modern Behavior"" with the weight of the world on his slumped shoulders.<br/><br/>Theirs is a murky sort of melancholy: though Narrows opens wide on most of <i>Flaamingos</i>' choruses, he mumbles his way through these verses, unpursing his lips only to replace a spent Lucky Strike. (Unfiltered, I'm sure.) Fizzling, squealing synths come in twos and threes, which-- when coupled with the rigid drum programming found of most of <i>Flaamingos</i>-- gives the disc its been-a-while-since-we-left-this-basement-hasn't-it claustrophobia. Narrows stews, wallows, declares himself all but unfit for humanity; ""Explicitly, all I wanna do is live,"" he sings on the album's first track, then spends the rest of it making you wonder how true that could be. ""If by chance you seek romance, sorry to say, I'm not fit to stay,"" he moans on Flaamingos closer ""Creation."" That's more like it.<br/><br/><i>Flaamingos</i> is muggy, glum, just shy of agoraphobic, a not-undanceable bummer for the type of people who leave their trenchcoats on indoors. In essence, it's new wave, even if there's nothing particularly new about it; the band's SEO-enhanced moniker might be their only concession to anything more modern than, oh, <i>Black Celebration</i>. This particular strain of mope-rock never really went away, but right now, it's having another little moment; Flaamingos' fellow left-coasters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27783-crocodiles/"" target=""_blank"">Crocodiles</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29185-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Weekend</a> each have new records steeped in a similar synthy, sighing darkness.</p>
<p>Lyrically, Narrows often seems a bit stuck inside his own head. He wisely sidesteps the maudlin brood of many of his contemporaries, but the way he jumps from image to fragmented image makes for a slightly scattered listen. And, while they've got a way with desperation-- never better than on ""She's Never Satisfied"", with its cracking ""there's only one of us in ecstasy on this night"" refrain-- these songs lose their centers whenever tempos slow. But, where so much mopey post-punk/early new wave revivalism gets itself stuck in the shadows-- letting foul moods cloud out anything resembling a novel melody or a texture any lighter than dark grey-- Flaamingos have a way of slipping just enough color into their songs to keep <i>Flaamingos</i> from turning into a total drag.<br/><br/>""In between the lines, there's texture, colored by an active mind,"" Narrows sings on the dubbed-from-Dolby ""Digital Dialogue."". With so much of <i>Flaamingos</i> outlined in charcoal-- the deadpan verses, the chest-clutching choruses, and Narrows' pining, self-lacerating lyrics-- any color's left to the detail-work. This, truly, is where Flaamingos excel. Little bursts of neon jut out through the darkness and momentarily light up the night. Terse synth-popper ""Expressions"" is just another lonely night at the danceclub until a slippery little guitar lick works its way out from the backdrop, casting Narrows' gunmetal-black lamentations in a far more flattering blacklight-purple. ""All I Wanna Do Is Live"" offsets its pleading verses with a downright symphonic synth line, raising Narrows' inner drama to cinematic heights. It doesn't always work; the reverb-spackled ""Fall With Me"" wobbles as if encased in Jello, and from time to time, all these burbling baselines and dust-ridden drum machines crowd Narrows out of his own frame. But, while the dark and narrow path Flaamingos finds itself on sometimes gets a little cramped, these moments of luminosity help keep Flaamingos from retreating too far into the fog.</p></div>"|18333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18333-flaamingos-flaamingos/|5.9|Paul Thompson

Well, they’re only half right. The album marries their previous releases in one noisy, polyamorous black wedding that shows promise for the future, but is more a celebration of the past. Think about the band’s 2012 LP<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16343-pre-language/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window""><i> Pre Language</i></a>, and their song ""Minor Patterns"" where singer Brian Case sneers, “Why bother, it’s been done.” That defeatist phrase must be something that sticks in the craw of young psych acolytes. The well-worn motorik highway now seems too predictable, calling out for more hairpin turns, off-road detours, and above all some better scenery. On <i>Era</i>, Disappears begin to pave a path to transcendence that's a little more varied, grabbing the more anemic sounds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/779-clinic/"">Clinic</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a>, while keeping the forward momentum of their most obvious influences <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a> and rough-edged <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Velvet Underground</a>. They know they trade in the business of the past and work within confined musical language, but they play on, middle fingers scratching their eyebrows.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the macro scope of Disappears’ catalog, </span><i>Era</i><span> is the moment when the groove finally locks into place. To call it a new beginning would be a disservice to the somewhat ill-advised territories the band has ventured into, especially with their EP </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17912-disappears-kone-ep/"">Kone</a></i>, released earlier this year.<span> <i>Kone</i>'s</span><span> title track seems like a 15-minute flavorless psych wafer in contrast to the spritely but unfulfilling </span><span><i>Pre Language</i>. But i</span><span>t all starts to come together on </span><span><i>Era</i>: </span><span>the post-punk propulsion, the protracted kraut rhythms born out of the negative spaces of no-wave, the macabre baritone croons. It’s been done before, but now it’s being done like Disappears.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Era </i><span>swirls around its centerpiece, the nine-and-a-half minute “Ultra”. It's the song Disappears have been angling toward their career. If Swans ever decided to replace their bolo ties with skinny ties, they might’ve written something like it. After the departure of Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley, Noah Leger lends a new energy to the band. He lays back in the pocket right with bassist Damon </span><span>Carruesco for a rhythm section that sounds like it’s trying to be the extroverted kid but can’t stop sulking in the corner</span><span>. So often </span><i>Era</i><span> sounds like an indictment of dance music with an industrial bent, a Ciroc martini served with a black beetle crawling around the rim.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Placed around the load-bearing “Ultra” is a family of tunes cut from a familiar cloth. “Elite Typical” is the burlier brother with a similar four-to-the-floor beat, while “Girl” opens the album like a starter canon, a one-song best-of compilation of the band’s shorter noise-rock tracks. There was always an unfulfilled desire with their songs on </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14162-lux/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lux</i></a><span> and </span><span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14988-guider/"" target=""_blank""><i>Guider</i></a>,</span><span> that sense that you wish the band would extend these songs out because if they’re just gonna cruise they might as well try to jam. With “Girl”, the band finally writes a shapely rock song in under four minutes.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Case’s sour baritone on <i>Era </i>is the final piece of the puzzle. He mirrors the band and obsesses over oblique phrases like, “Does it end together/ Does it end soon” on “Ultra” or “A new house in a new town” on the closer “New House.” Even with all his lyrical repetition, his words tend to crumble around the music, leaving only hints of something about fists answering first and waking up to a girl's touch. There’s a slice of glam sexuality to it in that disconcerting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22521-the-birthday-party/"" target=""_blank"">Birthday Party</a> kind of way, though, like its lyrics, some of the music can veer into the murky waters of unspecificity. When Disappears don't shape their songs, like the unremarkable “Power”, they end up loitering in the space somewhere between air-drumming and space-tripping. Mostly, though, <i>Era</i> showcases all the work Disappears have done cutting and splicing and regathering their sound together to regain their identity. It’s still lurking in the shadows, but finally, it's there. </p></div>"|18430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18430-disappears-era/|7.3|Jeremy D. Larson

Geddes Gengras</a>, a Los Angeles-based musician whose career to date has been a super-charged blitz through myriad genre shifts and musical accomplices. (Fortunately, he has a huge amount of music streaming for free on his <a href=""http://mgeddesgengras1.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> page, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9112-sonic-omnivores/"">Out Door</a> comprehensively chronicled his work in a feature from earlier this year.) It's not necessary to become fully acquainted with Gengras' output to enjoy <i>Collected Works Vol. 1: The Moog Years</i>, a limited vinyl and digital release of contemplative instrumental work. In fact, anyone familiar with his most popular release to date, as part of the Gengras/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28951-sun-araw/"">Sun Araw</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13147-the-congos/"">Congos</a> culture crash that gave us the euphoric <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16513-icon-give-thank/"">Icon Give Thank</a></i>, will find themselves stepping onto craggier land here. Gone are the sunshine and purity from <i>Icon</i>, with a strong sense of embrace replaced by something far more inward looking and ruminative.</p>
<p>Gengras' work with the Moog largely sidesteps common sounds connected to the instrument. This isn't the giddy, frothy, bubbly tone found on countless covers records in the vein of <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Marty-Gold-Moog-Plays-The-Beatles/release/385134"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Moog Plays the Beatles</i></a>. Gengras cites <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> as the first band he heard who used the instrument, but their avant-pop approach lies in sharp contrast to his work here. Instead, he's remarkably restrained, choosing to tease out tiny motifs, letting oscillators softly pulse in the background, barely leaving a trace of hefty bass. It's not clear which Moogs Gengras was using, but clearly he's more enamored with using them to paint fainter traces than he is with going into all-out attack mode. It's a sound with more common companions in the past than the present, at times recalling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30221-daphne-oram/"">Daphne Oram</a>'s moody ""Brociliande"" or the processor noise of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30237-suzanne-ciani/"">Suzanne Ciani</a>'s ""Second Breath"".</p>
<p>The strong shift in mood strung across <i>Collected Works</i> is to be expected from something that was recorded in different periods, but what's surprising is how well that creates a sense of journey across the record. Compilations don't often hang together well, usually forging rather awkward trails that hint at how ideas evolved. But here it's mostly seamless, with a lament punctured by noises that sound like a fried circuit board (""Resistor"") segueing perfectly into a minimalist composition that resembles the work <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> was indulging in around the time of <i>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</i> (""Untitled #4""). Gengras can alternate between big and small in a heartbeat-- the opening ""10.17.2009"" has a boundless feel that positions it in a place as vast as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2996-mountains/"">Mountains</a>' most recent output, while ""Inductor"" meshes a mix of twinkly electronics and new age yearning that aligns it with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30634-laurie-spiegel/"">Laurie Spiegel</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17067-the-expanding-universe/""><i>The Expanding Universe</i></a>.</p>
<p>Clearly Gengras is well schooled in this stuff, but there are only a handful of too-obvious steals from the music that preceded him in this field. Mostly he's focussed on setting and mood, reaching down to a place that makes it feel like he's trying to make the electronic equivalent of an old blues record. At its best this album has a weather-worn feeling, a sense of analog circuitry entering old age, maturing gracefully from frivolous beginnings. It fits well with the idea that these synths are very personal instruments, with each having unique quirks and characteristics. It's not always successful, but <i>Collected Works</i> reaches moments of poignancy, usually when a bank of synth noise rolls in and provides a dark cloak to hang over the track. In those moments you can almost picture Gengras carefully stabbing at a Moog keyboard, trying to figure out where the emotional center of such a surprisingly malleable instrument could possibly lie.</p></div>"|18400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18400-m-geddes-gengras-collected-works-vol-1-the-moog-years/|6.8|Nick Neyland

Especially if the “more of the same + calculated risks” sophomore bow comes in between. Though <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1605-franz-ferdinand/"">Franz Ferdinand</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12609-tonight/""><i>Tonight </i></a>was a fine record, it was a largely hitless one, rounding off a common career arc from which few, if any, bands make a meaningful artistic recovery. Just ask yourself whether <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol"">Interpol</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes"">the Strokes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"">Bloc Party</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2956-maximo-park/"">Maximo Park</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers"">the Killers</a> made the best fourth album. The festival circuit still beckons, so you either blow things up or just keep trudging forward, but on <i>Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action, </i>Franz Ferdinand do a little bit of both and not enough of either.</p>
<p>After a four year hiatus, the mere act of sounding like Franz Ferdinand can feel like a “comeback” in both a literal and figurative sense. Perhaps for that very reason, the first half wisely tries to provide a contact buzz by establishing a subtle, but unmistakable proximity to Franz Ferdinand’s better-known material. The opening title track repeats its name enough times where it becomes a hook in spite of its clunky rhythm and dull, anhedonic sentiment; better is the one-bar drum fill bearing the same EQ'ing as the 16th-note snare rip from “Take Me Out.” It's damn near a sampled breakbeat. The chorus of “Evil Eye” slinks and skulks enough to recall a time when Franz Ferdinand sounded sleazier and more dancefloor-oriented than your average rock band, but it has to fight through a verse filled with bothersome vocal filters (an indulgent byproduct of their self-production) to do so.</p>
<p>There is something pleasant and quaint about hearing Franz Ferdinand reestablish themselves as a workmanlike, crowd-pleasing dance-rock band by going heavy on the midtempo disco thump; mind you, they arose at a time when “dance-rock” still meant <i>guitar </i>bands and went heavier on the right side of the hyphenate. And bringing in Bjorn Yttling and Todd Terje to help out on production and slightly nudge them out of that stasis has to constitute right thoughts and right actions, right? Yet, the biggest letdown here is how often Kapranos fails to find the right words.</p>
<p>Franz Ferdinand initially stood out amongst the glut of post-Strokes pretty boys for their wit and playful sexuality, qualities which aren’t tied to a particular sound and tend to age well. Similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys"">Arctic Monkeys</a>’ Alex Turner, you’d figure Kapranos would make for a good balladeer-- as far back as <i>Franz Ferdinand</i>, he already sounded like an older man playing a young man’s game, wearied and louche. But Franz Ferdinand have yet to prove a knack for balladry. The baroque pop flourishes of “Fresh Strawberries” and “The Universe Expands”’s bleeping electro show how crucial momentum and groove are to Franz Ferdinand’s musicianship by their lack thereof; though four minutes apiece, they feel twice as long. The<i> </i>prevalence of insistence over finesse is confirmed by lead single “Love Illumination”, which doesn’t grow on you as much as twist your arm into submission; a Los Angeles nightmare of overeager-to-please Fitz &amp; the Tantrums soul-pop and Edward Sharpe's clap-trap uplift (“sweet love illumination/ sweet, sweet love elevation”), I doubt it would be improved in the slightest if Franz Ferdinand were being sarcastic about the whole affair. </p>
<p>They’re probably not-- if you’re trying to draw blood, sarcasm’s a pretty dull blade and Franz Ferdinand aren't in attack mode either musically or thematically. Still, just about anything's sharper than the diffident lyrics that Kapranos brings to <i>Right Thoughts. </i>If you’re still holding him to the standards set by the clever repartee in “Dark of the Matinee” and “Michael”, you’ll drive yourself mad trying to force additional layers of meaning into the central metaphor of “Fresh Strawberries”-- “We will soon be rotten/ We will all be forgotten.” Same goes for “Bullet”, which sanitizes and lobotomizes the sex-as-target practice construct of “Take Me Out” (“Never get your bullet out of my head/ Never get your bullet out of my mind”) and “Treason! Animals”, which exists for the sole purpose of its titular pun, which is really not worth living for.</p>
<p>But I suppose half-assed is preferable to when Kapranos puts his whole backside and thensome into “Goodbye Lovers and Friends”. Already saddled with the stale meta-textual effect of using a presumptive breakup song as an album closer, an additional coat of unfortunate irony is laid on by the self-reference that suggests it’s <i>Franz Ferdinand’s </i>breakup song. “You know I hate pop music,” Kapranos sings and like a lot of <i>Right Thoughts, </i>he sorta kinda means it, but not really. On the other hand, the last words on <i>Right Thoughts </i>are ""When they lie and say this is not the end/ You can laugh as if we’re still together/ But this really is the end"" and their sincerity is a moot point. You're just meant to applaud an obvious punchline.</p>
<p>Still, while <i>Right Words </i>achieves a baseline level of quality or at least competency with the exception of “Goodbye Friends and Lovers” and ""Love Illumination"", they lack the conviction to take most of their lesser ideas to the realm of being unpleasant rather than kinda boring. Maybe that's a positive; if anything on <i>Right Words</i> came up on satellite radio, you probably wouldn’t turn it off. But by the same token, you also wouldn’t hesitate to use them as a bathroom break in a live setting, lest you miss “Take Me Out” or ""Do You Want To?"" At the very least, while the letdown of <i>Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action </i>isn’t all that surprising, the reasons for it are. It’s got nothing to do with the currency of a template the band all but perfected over a decade ago-- if anything, <i>Franz Ferdinand </i>sounds even fresher in 2013, since it's not like they have to duke it out with the Rakes, the Fratellis, and the Kaiser Chiefs or their modern day equivalents. Yet you can’t help but feel like the title isn’t a tribute to resolve or a refreshed sense of purpose, but rather a more erudite way of telling us they’re going through the motions.</p></div>"|18429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18429-franz-ferdinand-right-thoughts-right-words-right-action/|5.4|Ian Cohen

He comes off as the inverse of lablemate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a>'s narcotic AM kaleidoscopes: a button-up, FM-obsessive who just has his shit a little more together. In the context of a boutique label like Paw Tracks -- with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"">Black Dice</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13303-alien-in-a-garbage-dump/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Copeland,</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1411-excepter"" target=""_blank"">Excepter</a> on the roster -- May is the palate cleanser, the fresh drink of sweet lemonade after a cocktail of Campari and motor oil. Maybe at Paw Tracks luncheons he’s the odd man out, where the other noiseniks are sharing an experimental demo tape recorded with a vintage arpeggiator in a large field, Dent May is pacing around humming a pop melody with his hands in his pockets, thinking about where he last had his keys.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Considering that Dent May obsesses over the banalities of love in his songs, that fantasy really isn’t a stretch. Last year’s LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16713-do-things/"" target=""_blank""><i>Do Things</i></a> saw him doing the kind of unremarkable things best suited for the notes in the margin in the book of summer-- breezy songs filled with platitudes about young love and the woes of paying rent. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/186-warm-blanket/"" target=""_blank""><i>Warm Blanket</i></a>, May revisits many of the same themes that he did just over a year ago, only with fuller orchestrations, and a partial explanation for his love of the mundane. His debt to and admiration of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson"" target=""_blank"">Brian Wilson</a> is more prominent than ever, sounding almost like he had Murray Wilson in the studio with him cracking the whip and tightening the harmonies to make each melody as sticky as possible. The problem is Dent May -- the one-man band who wrote, arranged, and performed the bulk of this album -- is not only still not doing things, but he’s not really saying things, either.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">May’s main worry on <i>Warm Blanket</i> is this idea that he is living in the wrong era. The album’s thesis is presented in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15653-dent-may-born-too-late/"" target=""_blank"">“Born Too Late”</a>, where May cascades down a chorus singing “Born too late to tell you that I love you baby/ But I want you to know I been thinkin’ about you lately.” It’s a sweet tune, one of the best he’s ever written, and it sticks around longer that it has any right too. Similar is “Ready to Be Old”, where we get a hint of May’s malaise: “I think the future will feel much better than I feel now.” His dissatisfaction with the present informs his songwriting, born ceaselessly into the past with lyrics that could be anything from schoolyard love-notes to something that could've been crooned by Bing Crosby. Wit, irony, satire mostly elude May across the album-- instead there are 11 songs of bedroom-surf rock that are so bizarrely simple they become ingratiating.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Maybe that’s May’s goal: to shine a light on efficacy of simplicity in the face of the complexities of modern life. The syncopated way he sings the chorus of of “Summer Is Over” that borrows from the Beach Boys wholesale doesn’t require any subtext or cleverness. Maybe its May’s exhaustion with the layers of 21st century communication that pushes him to use colorless nouns and tropey turns of phrase to write songs, like ""So let them hate us/ 'cause we're not haters"" on ""Let Them Talk"". Whatever the case, his hooks get stuck in your head but his lyrics are thin and forgettable.

In order to understand why expectations are unusually high for <i>Colored Sands</i>-- the first new LP since 2001 from this Quebec death-metal institution-- you have to look back to 1998's <i>Obscura</i>, one of the most pungently progressive albums ever made, in or out of metal. <i>Obscura</i> didn't just register as technical; it sounded downright excruciating, as if its shuddering blastbeats, doleful bellows, and deliriously inventive guitarwork were being torn straight from the chests of its makers.</p>
<p>But as brilliant as <i>Obscura</i> was, and as wide as its influence has spread-- it holds a hallowed place not just among <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2012/06/remembering-big-steeve-hurdle/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">discerning death-metalheads</a>, but in <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2011/04/heavy-metal-be-bop-2-interview-with-craig-taborn/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">open-eared jazz circles</a> as well-- it wasn't exactly a definitive Gorguts release. The band made their name playing in a very different style. Their first two LPs, 1991's <i>Considered Dead</i> and 1993's <i>The Erosion of Sanity</i>, demonstrated impressive tightness and a flair for involved composition, but they were very much of their time-- unrelentingly intense dispatches descended from the bulging-vein aggression of 80s thrash. Conceived as early as 93, but not issued until 98, <i>Obscura</i> shocked longtime listeners, who couldn't believe the madness the band's lengthy gestation had birthed.</p>
<p>That chapter of Gorguts was short-lived, though, as guitarist/vocalist Steeve Hurdle-- a key co-architect of <i>Obscura</i>, who died tragically last year at age 41-- left the band in 1999. On the next Gorguts LP, 2001's sorely underrated <i>From Wisdom to Hate</i>, founder and sole constant member Luc Lemay streamlined <i>Obscura</i>'s demented sprawl, yielding a less outlandish yet equally distinguished statement. This was a wise move; there would've been no way to out-weird <i>Obscura</i>.</p>
<p>Fans have known for a while that the next Gorguts record was shaping up to be another fresh start. When Lemay revived the group in 2009, after a suggestion from Hurdle that he commemorate Gorguts' 20th anniversary, he took a new approach to bandbuilding. Gorguts had always been a locally sourced project, staffed by musicians from Lemay's Quebec home base-- including Hurdle, bassist Steve Cloutier and current Voivod guitarist Daniel Mongrain-- but this time, he set about assembling a North American progressive-metal all-star team. This band, which appears on <i>Colored Sands</i>, includes two NYC luminaries: bassist Colin Marston, of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"" target=""_blank"">Krallice</a> and Behold… the Arctopus, and guitarist Kevin Hufnagel, Marston's bandmate in Dysrhythmia. The drummer is John Longstreth, best known for his work in Kansas's hypertechnical Origin. It would be reductive to peg any of these players as members of a post-Gorguts generation, but their work during the past decade embodies the same spirit that drove <i>Obscura</i>: a conception of metal as art music, not in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a> sense-- where the genre commingles with drone, noise and other abstracted forms-- but in the sense of a creatively restless pursuit, a union of unfettered imagination and rigorous virtuosity. Like Luc Lemay, Marston, Hufnagel, and Longstreth have each established themselves as master players driven to expand their idiom without assailing its core tenets.</p>
<p>The highest compliment you could pay <i>Colored Sands</i> would be a simple description of what it is: a fully formed outing from an outstandingly pedigreed new incarnation of an already legendary band. Thanks to Lemay's trademark anguished roar and dark-prog riff savvy, <i>Colored Sands</i> feels unmistakably like a Gorguts record, but the compositions-- most by Lemay, with Marston and Hufnagel each contributing a single song-- don't mimic any particular chapter of the band's past. The record's greatest strength is its vast dynamic range. On one hand, it contains some of the thorniest, most aggressive death metal ever issued under the Gorguts name; on the other, it includes moments of stunning textural beauty. That duality is a perfect fit for the album's surprisingly specific lyrical theme: the way Tibetan culture encompasses both ancient majesty and modern despair.</p>
<p>It seems odd to praise a Gorguts record for its prettiness, but some of the most memorable passages on <i>Colored Sands</i> are also the subtlest-- transitional sections that punctuate the band's signature gritted-teeth shred. Opening track ""Le Toit du Monde"" orbits a hypnotic, clean-toned motif-- a waltz-time riff marked by chiming harmonics-- and Hufnagel seasons his extraordinary ""Absconders"" with a dreamy interlude, an oasis of eerie calm in the middle of a churning epic. Other pieces thrive on adrenaline. Marston's ""Forgotten Arrows"" features a thrillingly complex central theme, which seems descended both from Dysrhythmia's intricate chiaroscuro riffs and the blastbeat-driven turbo-prog of Behold… the Arctopus. On the other hand, Lemay's title track-- a doomy plod that trades math-metal daredevilry for hard-grooving 4/4-- is one of the most straightforwardly headbangable tracks in the Gorguts discography.</p>
<p>Diverse approaches aside, all the songs here share a rare coherence: they're as info-packed as the pieces on <i>Obscura</i> or <i>From Wisdom to Hate</i>, but their construction feels especially logical. While not the most extreme compositions Gorguts have issued, they might be the richest and most memorable; the patiently unfolding arrangements-- complemented by a spacious, full-bodied production job that contrasts sharply with the harsh, brittle sound of <i>Obscura</i> and <i>From Wisdom</i>-- give each idea room to really sink in.</p>
<p>There's also a strong band unity at work here, honed onstage over the past several years. No Gorguts album has grooved harder than <i>Colored Sands</i>, a fact that has a lot to with John Longstreth, who excels at making dauntingly proggy riffs feel sprightly and pliable. His rapid-fire snare/hi-hat stutter on the verse sections of ""Ember's Voice"" and the chopsy yet remarkably relaxed post-fusion fills he busts out during the ""Absconders"" outro exemplify how technical flourishes can enhance a song's momentum rather than hinder it. During moments when the full quartet digs into a meaty pattern-- the sci-fi thrash episode in the middle of ""Forgotten Arrows,"" the lurching slam breakdown in ""Enemies of Compassion""-- you're hearing four expert players uniting with Voltron-like purpose: not just a provisional assemblage but a real band at work.</p>
<p>At the same time, <i>Colored Sands</i> is, like each of the four Gorguts albums that precedes it, a personal statement from Luc Lemay. For those inclined to read liner notes and follow a lyric sheet, there's a hefty amount of thematic data in the margins of this record that gives it a very different feel than any of the band's prior efforts. The first two Gorguts albums dealt with standard-issue death-metal topics (disease, corruption, madness); <i>Obscura</i> turned inward, tackling depression and spiritual crisis; <i>From Wisdom to Hate</i> was a topical grab-bag, covering religious delusion, political megalomania, and the fascination of antiquity. Here, simply put, Lemay has Tibet on the brain. An <a href=""http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=192124"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted outsider to the culture</a>, he nevertheless taps into some profound emotions, touching on the deep spirituality of Tibetan Buddhist tradition, as well as the region's purgatorial struggle with Chinese rule.</p>
<p>The idea of a death-metal vocalist howling about sand mandalas and snow lions might look iffy on paper, but the concept sticks, thanks to the dynamism of the music and the conviction Lemay brings to every line. The frontman isn't holding Tibetan culture at arm's length; his seething bellows on tracks such as ""Reduced to Silence"" come off as a kind of rigorous method acting, as though he were revisiting personal trauma in an effort to comprehend the Sisyphean ordeal of the culture he's depicting. It's admirable that just as Lemay has regularly renovated the Gorguts sound, moving ever further from death-metal orthodoxy, he's also worked to find fresh thematic approaches like the one that unifies <i>Colored Sands</i>.</p>
<p>Lemay also shows off his creative breadth on ""The Battle of Chamdo"", an instrumental piece for string ensemble. Previous Gorguts albums have featured classical-style intros and interludes, cluing fans in to Lemay's training as a violinist and composer, but ""Chamdo"" is the first full-length stand-alone track of this type issued under the band's name. The composition's strident, martial rhythms and mournful melodies give it a distinct soundtracky quality, as though Lemay were narrating rather than simply evoking China's 1950 invasion of Tibet. ""Chamdo"" appears at the album's midpoint, and while the piece isn't as arresting as the metal-oriented material that surrounds it, it serves as a smart palate cleanser.</p>
<p><i>Obscura</i> found Gorguts reemerging in bizarrely mutated form; <i>Colored Sands</i> represents a subtler yet similarly striking evolution. Just as he did on <i>Obscura</i> and <i>From Wisdom to Hate</i>, Luc Lemay has chosen expert collaborators here and given them the freedom to leave their mark on the band's legacy.

Originally known as Girlfriends, the trio-- bassist Supriya Gunda, drummer Andy Sadoway, and guitarist Ben Potrykus-- has been a hometown hero of small venues and house shows since they formed in 2009, racking up nominations and wins for their high-strung, merciless garage-pop at the <i>Boston Phoenix</i>'s annual Boston Music Poll. Aside from a handful of short, micro-distribution releases, however, they were almost exclusively a live act, one that required fans to seek them out in person to get a proper fix. Then in May of last year, blaming a need for change and the addition of a new guitarist (who vanished almost as soon as she appeared), Girlfriends became Bent Shapes. They collected the bitingly catchy punk songs they'd released over their three years as a band and released a compilation called <i>Cull Shorts</i>, a sort of scrapbook retrospective on the Band That Was Girlfriends. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Though <i>Cull Shorts </i>marked the end of an era, its<i> </i>patchwork structure lingers on <i>Feels Weird</i>. Despite the new collection's intention as a formal album, it contains disordered messes of frenetic declarations, judgments, and uncertainties that have become part of the band's character. While incongruous, seemingly unplanned mishmash on a debut would sink a less experienced band, Bent Shapes' honed songcraft is such that missing the forest for the trees is actually a great idea. As a debutante collection-- celebrating the band's introduction to the world beyond New England at long last, something their contemporaries, and they too, until now, have eschewed-- <i>Feels Weird</i> serves as an eclectic, vivid primer on its creators' sprightly misanthropy. </p>
<p class=""p1"">From the outset, ""Behead Yrself Pt. 2"" establishes the band's innate grasp on the alluring grievance: bullshit abounds, especially in their uniquely overeducated, often self-important city. Drawing on proto- and post-punk influences like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"" target=""_blank"">the Feelies</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3572-jonathan-richman/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Richman</a>, each track exposes a different blistering sore; Sadoway's mellow vocals and Gunda's bouncing, all-business ones knock Potrykus off his earnestly charming soapbox in healthy doses. ""Brat Poison"", the most explicit, electrifying, and outright funny cut on the record by a wide margin, drips with sarcastic contempt as it eviscerates the hypocritical arrogance of loudmouthed local-scene personalities. (With lines like ""drum circle jerks"" and ""Go put yourself into orbit/ where verbose is verboten/ ferocious, forgotten,"" it's also a quintessential example of Bent Shapes' immaculate attention to wordplay.) You don't have to have spent time in Boston to appreciate its diss-track qualities, but those fans probably get an amplified experience. </p>
<p class=""p1"">At times, their disgust waxes preachy; at others, like on the garrulous ""Boys to Men"", their need to say something <i>the right way</i> tangles a song in its own feet, like the words of someone who's been holed up alone in his apartment for too many days in a row, and the band stumbles. But for every overstep, there's a song like ""Bites and Scratches"", a personal and heartbreakingly sweet cut about love amidst baggage, that serves as a reminder that they're also dissatisfied with their own complicity and intimate failings. And even as it bubbles over into excess, it's hard to bemoan Bent Shapes' knack for marrying lyricism and melody. Every song-- save ""Hex Maneuvers"", a dreamy experiment that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>'s aqueous twang with moderate success-- is irresistibly upbeat in its complaint. Their criticisms, on paper, can seem distant, but somehow-- whether it's vulnerable moments like ""I'm not saying you need some deep-seated hatred of self/ But it helps"" and ""I met a girl, to my surprise/ Said 'I'm damaged goods', she said, 'So am I,' / so I held her hand,"" or the blithe delivery of even the most biting invectives, or merely a trick of the pop-guitar lick-- there's something genuinely warm about them. Ultimately, theirs are statements that both ask for and infinitely reward a second spin.</p></div>"|18347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18347-bent-shapes-feels-weird/|7.0|Devon Maloney

This is the Cocteau Twins, if they looked so far inward that they began to focus on the darker, downer-ridden side. Along with lovesliescrushing, who freed shoegaze from pop conventions, they became one of the noteworthy and boundary-pushing acts on the goth music label Projekt. <i>Quiet Moments</i>, their first release for Handmade Birds (run by Rich Loren of Pyramids, Sailors With Wax Wings, and White Moth), is consistent with their past efforts, while remaining an intriguing headphone journey.</p>
<p>At this point, Lycia are basically Mike VanPortfleet, the multi-instrumentalist has always been the band's creative center, though longtime member Tara Vanflower contributes vocals to “The Soil Is Dead” and Spring Trees”. They sound like a band that takes their time. It's not just in the pace of the music, but in all of the layers. Somber synths permeate the record, often drawling and creating a fog that covers everything. The percussion is mechanical, and its repetitiveness lends to the drone. Guitars sound like disembodied rock solos, severed from boogie and strangled out into something darkly beautiful. There are faint memories of sweet leads from radio jams, but they become mutated and placed into a context wholly unlike anything that would resemble rock. In particular, the guitars bring to mind the lush metal of <i>October Rust</i>-era Type O Negative, albeit spaced out and even more blissful. Peter Steele was an early champion of Lycia, stating in <a href=""http://www.theroc.org/roc-mag/textarch/roc-18/roc18-06.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">an interview from 1995</a> that their album <i>A Day in the Stark Corner </i>had a great effect on him:<i> </i>“If I put it on in the morning when I get up...I'm useless for the rest of the day. It's just devastating, as beautiful as it is devastating.” Lycia opened for Type O Negative on some of the dates in support of <i>Rust.</i> He picked up on their sound for one of the band's biggest albums, and Lycia are returning the favor in their own way on <i>Moments</i>.</p>
<p>If they could, Lycia would probably name all of their albums <i>Cold</i>, the title of their record from 1996. It's an apt word for their sound, which, like the Rockies in December, can be as unforgiving as it is serene. “Antarctica” and “Greenland”, whose names and placements next to each other on <i>Moments</i> could hardly be considered a coincidence, represent <i>Moments</i> at its most frost-bitten. Percussion becomes more sparse, the guitars feel even more alien: “Grand Rapids” makes the album crawl slower, and the next track, “The Pier,” sees Lycia bringing <i>Moments</i> to almost a halt. The last three songs on <i>Moments</i> reflect a sharp shift towards more beat-oriented territories. Still, it's hardly danceable.</p>
<p>If Justin K. Broadrick was listening to Lycia when he first began making music as Jesu, it would not come off as a surprise. Vanportfleet's lyrics speak to a melancholy that's left intentionally open-ended, and his vocal approach even resembles Broadrick at his most tender and vulnerable. “The Visitor” is devastating, exploring abandonment: “I wait and wait to hope to see/ someone from my family/ Will no one come to visit me?/ I could use the company.” Loneliness is so rampant that you have to wonder if there is a “visitor” at all. Pains of childhood are also touched upon in “Antarctica” (“I see old pictures of a boy (me)/ standing, so alone and far away/ buried for miles and miles and miles”) and “Rapids” (“In sleep I see the city/ from building tops alone/ fading childhood memories/ This never, can ever, by my home”). <i>Moments</i>' cover features photos from VanPortfleet's family collection, of VanPortfleet himself. He wants to go back, but where that is isn't around anymore, or maybe it never was. The sentiment is vague, but also universal. Sure, this music isn't wholly accessible, but many people can relate to VanPortfleet's sense of loss and mystery.</p></div>"|18439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18439-lycia-quiet-moments/|7.8|Andy O'Connor

""We would always sing a cappella,"" she explained in an interview a few years ago, ""And instead of instruments we would clap or sing in rhythmic rounds."" A curious kid and a bit of a loner, Barwick showed a precocious fascination with the human voice. Her hobbies included harmonizing with random sounds, making up songs about whatever she was doing at the moment, and singing long, loud notes in hollowed-out spaces like parking garages and inside the trunk of a giant tree just to see what the echo would sound like. ""It sounds kinda psycho, I know,"" she admitted in our interview, but sometimes ""I would sing to myself and get so lost in it that I would cry.""</p>
<p>Actually, it doesn’t sound <i>that</i> crazy; it’s very easy to become lost in the music that Barwick now makes as an adult. Over the span of her career, from her imaginative 2006 debut LP <i>Sanguine</i> up through 2011's dazzling breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15147-the-magic-place/""><i>The Magic Place</i></a> (the name is a nod to that aforementioned giant tree trunk, where she'd unwittingly discovered reverb), Barwick's gradually refined a process that is at once inventive and incredibly simple. She sings short, reverb-drenched, often wordless vocal fragments into a loop station (though she made the loops on the painstakingly lo-fi <i>Sanguine</i> using just a guitar pedal) and layers them into luminous compositions that feel like the aural equivalent of an airplane ride through a cloud. Toweringly sublime yet invitingly human, her music has an uncanny power to transform whatever space it's played in. It can make a cramped apartment feel like a high-ceilinged cathedral, or-- when she plays in one-- an actual cathedral feel like a gear-cluttered basement show.</p>
<p>Following the warm reception of <i>The Magic Place</i>, Barwick's approach has often been compared to ambient pioneers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> or the conceptual vocal artist Meredith Monk, but something about her music remains approachable and deeply personal—more intuitive than academic. Even as Barwick's songs become as polished and ambitious as those on her third full-length album, <i>Nepenthe</i>, they’ve managed to retain a certain playfulness and an openness to the process of discovery. It deserves mention among the best and most artful ambient music being made today, but Barwick’s work still feels like the realization of a dream left over from childhood, made by someone downright giddy that she has finally figured out a way to sing a round song with herself.</p>
<p><i>Sanguine</i>, the 2009 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13735-florine/""><i>Florine</i></a> and <i>The Magic Place</i> all conveyed a sense of serenity found in solitude, which is maybe why her collaborations with other artists have been such a mixed bag. Her records with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15538-frkwys-vol-6/"">Ikue Mori</a> (for RVNG’s FRKWYS series) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28016-helado-negro/"">Helado Negro</a> (as the duo OMBRE) have been solid, but a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15926-the-matrimony-remixes-ep/"">2011 remix EP</a> (featuring versions of <i>Magic Place</i> songs reworked by the likes of Diplo, Lunice and Prince Rama) basically just underscored how beside the point it is to remix a Julianna Barwick song. Her music is so pure and reliant on moments of quiet that another artists’ presence often overwhelms. So <i>Nepenthe</i> was a potentially risky move: It marks the first time she’s worked with other artists on one of her solo albums. And we’re not exactly talking anonymous session guys here: she recorded it with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a> collaborator Alex Somers (members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2865-mum/"">múm</a> and the string quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/253-amiina/"">Amiina </a>also contribute) at Sundlaugin, the band’s famed Icelandic “swimming pool studio.” (As a kid Barwick probably couldn’t have even imagined what sort of natural reverb you can get out of an <i>abandoned swimming pool</i>.)</p>
<p>Thankfully, <i>Nepenthe</i> sounds like a step forward for Barwick, a noticeable expansion in scope that still honors the sensibility that made her early records so unique. Somers’ lush production gives her music a larger and crisper depth of field, making it that much easier to get lost in its many overlapping folds. The structures of some of her tracks have become more complex: The billowing “The Harbinger” finds drama in the movement from crescendos to moments of quiet and back again, while the misty incantation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15621-one-half/"" target=""_blank"">“One Half”</a> feels (true to its title) like a seamless fusion of two separate arcs. (For once, there’s even discernable lyrics in that song, but their purpose is purely phonetic, like words spoken in a strange dream.) But even in its most epic moments, one of <i>Nepenthe</i>’s greatest virtues is restraint. Given free reign in one of the most spectacular studios imaginable, Barwick didn’t go all kid-in-a-candy-store on us here. <i>Nepenthe</i> is a modest evolution-- the work of an artist growing, smartly, to scale rather than adding on needless bells and whistles or pushing prematurely past her limits.</p>
<p>It’s also more emotionally complex than her past work. <i>The Magic Place</i> was a slice of pure, unfiltered bliss, but the songs on <i>Nepenthe</i> ache and yearn. Album opener “Offing” hovers like thick fog over a remote pond, while Amiina’s strings drone and growl ominously throughout “Pyrrhic”-- these songs are still ethereal, but they’re stormier clouds than Barwick’s conjured before. On a few tracks, Róbert Sturla Reynisson from múm plays a guitar that, true to his post-rock pedigree, sounds more like a tiny spaceship or the noises made by a comfortingly unthreatening alien. But it’s Amiina’s presence that’s particularly harmonious with Barwick’s overall aesthetic. They're creative with the sounds they get out of stringed instruments, which allows Barwick to use them in a way that says something more complex than “[insert orchestral grandeur here].” They often feel like an extension of her own voice. “Waving to You”, the muted, palliative finale, fits in so well with Barwick’s vibe that it took me a few listens to realize it’s the only song on the album without vocals.</p>
<p>Barwick claims she went to Iceland with nothing written ahead of time. This is how she’s always worked, from her childhood experiments up to <i>The Magic Place-- </i>tapping into the vibrations of the present, and turning them into something that is somehow both enduring and impermanent. You sense feelings of longing and unease all over <i>Nepenthe</i>, which makes it a less blissful place to spend time than her previous album. But that also makes it a much more cathartic listen, and perhaps a more rewarding one. </p></div>"|18408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18408-julianna-barwick-nepenthe/|8.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Note how ""Hung Up on a Flower"", the otherwise dirgey balladic centerpiece of last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16698-endless-flowers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Endless Flowers</i></a>, degenerates into two minutes of a woman nattering on in German, her voice echoing out in mutated shapes atop a bed of grimy guitar fuzz. The dying moments of ""I Like It in the Dark"" -- the opening track from Crocodiles' fourth LP, <i>Crimes of Passion -- </i>yield something equally nonsensical yet startling: The song's joyous gospel-delic groove fades out, but singer Brandon Welchez isn't quite finished talking yet, as he lets loose with an extended, a capella stream of beat-poet babble that was seemingly being drowned out all along by the boisterous song preceding it, like a dubbed-over cassette that didn't fully erase its previous contents. </p>
<p class=""p2"">No other moment on <i>Crimes of Passion</i> approaches the same degree of wanton absurdity. But where that random Deutsch-laden rant on ""Hung Up on a Flower"" stood into stark contrast to <i>Endless Flowers' </i>student-disco<i> </i>formalism, <i>Crimes of Passion</i>'s off-kilter intro serves as a harbinger of the album's guileless, unguarded spirit, as producer Sune Rose Wagner successfully coaxes the band to drop their Ray Bans and reveal the puppy-dog eyes welling up underneath. Sonically, Crocodiles are still very much the sort of band scientifically engineered to appease the small minority who believe the Jesus and Mary Chain's second-best album is <i>Munki</i> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7151-sub-pop-20-individual-staff-picks/#munki"" target=""_blank"">not that there's anything wrong with that</a>); Welchez lets his suggestive lyrics ooze out of his mouth like he was a third Reid brother, and whenever the band deviate from their trusty fuzz-pop playbook, it's in precisely the same ways U.K.-indie idols like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/"" target=""_blank"">Primal Scream</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"" target=""_blank"">Spiritualized</a> once did, whether deploying roadhouse horns, gospel-diva vocal wails, and steeple-shaking piano rolls as signifiers of Southern-soul authenticity or sci-fi synths to exude some Teutonic futurism. However, thanks to Rose Wagner's punchy production and emphasis on economy, <i>Crimes of Passion</i>-- unlike the band's previous records-- doesn't require the accompaniment of strobe lights and dry ice to fully connect. The new record basks in <i>Endless Flowers' </i>sunny<i> </i>afterglow<i>,</i> but the songs here are brasher, nervier, and a lot more fun.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even at its most slavishly Mary Chained-- ""Cockroach"" practically comes outfitted with its own <a href=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2009/2/19/1235060412662/The-Jesus-and-Mary-Chain-002.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pompadoured Afro</a>-- <i>Crimes of Passion</i> evinces a fidgety, tambourine-rattled exuberance that lends the record a brisk momentum, meaning a band that once routinely droned on past the five-minute mark can now get the job done in three. But the album is most distinguished by its starry-eyed ballads, like the Las-esque jangle-pop standout ""She Splits Me Up"" or the Jean Genet-copping moonlit lullaby ""Un Chant D'amour"". And while it may be a stretch to call the retro-gear fetishism of ""Teardrop Guitar"" a love song, its ecstatic verve makes for as solid a sequel to ""She Bangs the Drum"" as the reunited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12208-the-stone-roses/"" target=""_blank"">Stone Roses</a> could come up in 2013 if they tried. Such open-hearted gestures may not be enough to fully redirect Crocodiles away from the nihilism-by-numbers of ""Me and My Machine Gun"" and ""Gimme Some Annihilation"", but they offer encouraging evidence that the band is becoming more adept at not just projecting the aloof attitude of their Brit-rock influences, but their flair for disarming, emotionally resonant songcraft. At this point in the game, we've grown accustomed to seeing Crocodiles flash their teeth; it's much more interesting to see them shed their skin.</p></div>"|18411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18411-crocodiles-crimes-of-passion/|6.9|Stuart Berman

Unsatisfied with demos that featured their own vocals, they eventually reached out to Carmen Elle, a friend who had toiled around the local music scene for years, playing guitar with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29292-austra/"" target=""_blank"">Austra</a> and fronting her own garage-rock duo, Army Girls. Almost immediately she became a full-time member of the group, assuming all of the band's vocal responsibilities, and the decision to bring her in pays out dividends on their full-length debut, <i>Perpetual Surrender</i>, a confident collection of vaseline-smeared synth-pop that marries chillwave atmospherics with strong songwriting.</p>
<p>Let's address the chillwave thing first-- yes, there are a lot of aquamarine environments to get lost in on <i>Perpetual Surrender</i>, and yes, it's unafraid of pushing Elle's vocals so deep into the mix that it sounds like she's singing from the other side of a wall, but it does so with a panache that never forgets that this sort of thing can also knock the air out of your stomach when done right. A lot of the credit goes to Leavens, who proves himself an instinctive producer that knows when to keep adding and when to pull back and let things breathe. ""Foreign Installation"", for instance, is shrouded in a pre-dawn fog that calcifies into a black mass of a chorus before dissipating back into a fine mist. And then there's ""Strange Attraction"", where clanging percussion leads the way forward as much as the track's approaching-storm bass. He even manages to help turn the saxophone solo of the title track into one of the album's most rewarding moments, earning it with a keen ear for structure that finds the band more often than not placing sounds where they'll achieve maximum impact.</p>
<p>An emphasis on lower frequencies gives <i>Perpetual Surrender</i> a surprising heft in addition to its lush Balearic sprawl; it ends up a sturdier incarnation of a sound often charged with lacking bite. There are basslines that not only approach funky but actually <i>deserve</i> the adjective, producing a physicality that only someone who knows just how valuable a rhythm section can be to a band is capable of conjuring. When DIANA clear everything out, they're just as effective: ""New House"" is the album's sparsest moment, consisting of nothing more than moaning floorboards and intermittent bass, and it shines the spotlight on an affecting vocal performance from Elle, who effortless toggles between been-hurt-before reticence (""Am I just another thing to use, grow tired of, and throw away?"") and empathetic reassurance (""Baby, I know you're terrified""). It bowls you over with gentle-but-firm encouragement.</p>
<p>As much credit as DIANA deserve for their ability to create texture, <i>Perpetual Surrender</i> is first and foremost a pop record, and it's most successful when it plays up this ambition. Its songs-- mostly tales of romantic uncertainty aimed inward rather than outward-- were all written by Shabason and Adams, who have a knack for large earwormy hooks. The type of vocalist whose voice actually sounds better the harder it's pushed, Elle imbues these songs with a lived-in intimacy that belies the fact she didn't have a hand in penning them herself. ""Now's the time for believing/ Lay your hands on me, I need healing"" she sings on ""Born Again"", bestowing carnal relations with the power of spiritual purification. It's the album's best song, possessing a widescreen romanticism that the rest of the album can't quite duplicate elsewhere. A general wobbliness pervades the album, and there are places where it might benefit DIANA to zoom further out and sharpen their focus. Case in point: the album-closing instrumental ""Curtains"" is entirely inessential, aiming for epic but barely achieving consciousness. </p>
<p>This sense that DIANA are still figuring out how to best fit together the pieces they've got to work with serves as a reminder that <i>Perpetual Surrender</i> is a debut record-- a very compelling one, but a debut nonetheless. Now that Elle is a full-time member, it will be interesting to hear how their eventual follow-up differs in its songwriting, given that she does wonders with the material here.

Even though the pastel crocheted album art, Dill's flower tiaras and bindis, and firm belief in smiling at strangers can sometimes be <i>too</i> sweet, it's a little, well, mean to hate on a band that likes to <a href=""http://www.portalsmusic.com/2013/07/features/residency-mean-lady-week-4/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spontaneously play music</a> for homeless subway riders. Mean Lady's debut full-length, <i>Love Now</i>, the duo's first for Fat Possum, usually manages to transcend first impressions. Despite the inevitable baggage that comes with being a boy-girl indie-pop duo, <i>Love Now</i> is more than the sum of its small-town parts.</p>
<p>First, let's get the Zooey Deschanel comparisons out of the way, because Dill plays the ukulele and hula-hoops and describes herself on her <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Katie-Dill/90927639680?id=90927639680&amp;sk=info"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a> as ""music and art and giggles."" She even called it herself, <a href=""http://www.manikmusic.net/features/interview-mean-lady-discuss-their-debut-album-and-why-delaware-beats-brooklyn-every-time/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">citing She &amp; Him as an influence</a> insofar as ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"">M. Ward</a> producing a record and Zooey being a singer,"" a polite way of saying that's where the similarities end. Deschanel and Dill both occupy the contralto spectrum and their bands share ambiguous eye contact onstage, but the closest Mean Lady comes to any of the <i>Volumes</i> is probably ""I Will Marry You"", which floats a simple promise on a nuptial bed of crickets and banjos. If anything, <i>Love Now</i> draws more from Amber Coffman and Dave Longstreth's discordant chemistry, or even the dreamy dub of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29484-peaking-lights/"">Peaking Lights</a>, than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5676-she-him/"">She &amp; Him</a>'s retro jingles. (That exotic sound can also be traced to Dill and Nobles' stint in the tropicalia-inflected five-piece <a href=""https://myspace.com/diegopaulo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Diego Paulo</a> before they formed Mean Lady.)</p>
<p>Though Dill's vocal pitches <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=NGHqLWbMYDM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bear uncanny resemblance</a> to Coffman's and the house-of-mirrors delay on ""Why'd'ya Haftabee Sucha"" could be an outtake from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17429-lucifer-in-dub/""><i>Lucifer in Dub</i></a>, most of Mean Lady's material fits a completely different two-person mold. Dill <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewStC43mcnY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has said</a> the album can be divided into three-ish-song sets, each a variation on a theme. The ""theme"" is just Nobles arranging piano chords and Dill adding her voice, a couple of instrumental effects, and an intro, but somehow it doesn't feel repetitive; in fact, <i>Love Now</i>'s best songs are the ones that stick to that formula. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15421-far-away/"">""Far Away""</a> opens with sleigh bells and a single-note harmony, like an <i>om</i>, before joyously diving into sticky, sitar-driven handclaps. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14397-bop-bop/"">""Bop Bop""</a> takes a bit longer to get there, but its opening dual guitars are almost a better platform for Dill's voice than the following synthesizer flourishes.</p>
<p>It's when Mean Lady experiment that <i>Love Now</i> tends to falter. ""Haftabee"" is an admirable exercise in dub, even if it sounds like a misguided mash-up of Ella Fitzgerald and King Tubby, but the nine-minute ""Pony Ony O"" is just a drag. The song's title is cloying enough before it rhymes with ""Honey, you're the best best best best honey, don't you know"" or ""Why am I cry-crying… O"" (in that case, the stuttering mimics hiccupping sobs, which is pretty clever in theory, if not in execution). They're outliers on an otherwise cohesive album, which is itself part of the problem: Mean Lady's tried-and-true methods are so simple they might not sound as fresh on the next album. If Dill and Nobles have trouble when they try to grow as a band, they might want to revisit those building blocks.</p>
<p>But why do I have to be such a mean lady? After all, Dill and Nobles play music to make people happy, and <i>Love Now</i> shows that. It's a confident debut of ""nice music played and sung by a goofy lady"" and her partner, and an appropriately breezy, wistful album for the summer. And for now, that's enough.</p></div>"|18432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18432-mean-lady-love-now/|6.3|Harley Brown

They’re still the same morbid blood freaks that released classics like <i>Slaughtercult</i>,  <i>Gore Metal</i>, and the most perverse Led Zeppelin cover in existence, but as this new record shows, they've loosened up a little in their old age.</p>
<p><i>Necrocracy</i> marks a turning point in the band’s career. They’ve long hinted at their melodic inclinations, but this album makes no bones about it: longtime Carcass acolytes Exhumed have entered their <i>Heartwork</i> period, trading the sloppy savagery of old for a more refined kind of audio violence. They’ve upgraded their tools of the trade, casting aside meat cleavers and dripping chainsaws in favor of freshly sharpened surgical steel and opting for a cleaner production job.  Instead of burying the evidence, Exhumed ensure that each galloping riff and phlegmy gurgle is right there, mean-mugging right back at your ugly face. The grind has faded, and only death (and maybe a smear of punk) remains.</p>
<p>One of the biggest things that sets <i>Necrocracy</i> apart from the untold numbers of death metal records released so far this year is how damn catchy it is. It comes as no surprise, of course; Exhumed have always delighted in crafting ghoulish ear worms like perennial favorite, “The Matter of Splatter”, but the gang chants, groovy breakdowns, and meaty headbanger riffs strewn throughout this record take things to a new level. (Just try to get those gang-growls on the title track or “Ravening”s gruesomely audible chorus out of your head.)</p>
<p>“Coins Upon The Eyes” proves that intros are for wimps, slamming straight into a groovy death jam punctuated by Matt Harvey’s strangled Tompa “Go!” It creeps and vamps through a muscular Stockholm riff and searing Swedish melodeath solos, swaddled in a thick, satisfying guitar tone with just enough spit shine to make sure every instrument bleeds through. The bass tone is on point, too, leaving lots of space to throw its weight around. The band delight in shifting tempos and shocking their listener awake with wild solos and unexpected breakdowns. Closing track “The Rotting” goes off into an extended melodic passage that never gets boring, while the burly “Dysmorphic” breaks into an ominous acoustic interlude before diving back into the pit. “Sickened” starts with a perfectly spewed “Bleagh!” from Harvey, blasting through a perfect example of the interplay between the band’s trademark guttural bellows and frantic high-pitched squawks before barking out “Move your ass!” The jittery d-beat on “(So Passes) the Glory of Death” ensures that you’ll do just that. These tracks (as well as damn near everything else on the record) are going to slay in a live setting, just as Exhumed intended. They’re no slouches onstage, and <i>Necrocracy</i> is poised to add plenty of ammunition to that formidable live onslaught.</p>
<p>This may be Exhumed’s most accessible offering yet, but that doesn’t mean they’ve lost their edge. Matt Harvey and his merry maniacs know exactly what they’re doing, and have spent 20-0dd years perfecting their poisonous formula. The riffs still bludgeon, the snare still snaps, and the dual vocal assault still growls and yelps with the best of them. The wailing solos and brilliant flashes of melodic death metal perfection are a welcome addition, as is their maturing approach to songwriting. Ultimately,  <i>Necrocracy</i> is one more in a long line of killer albums, and thanks to its dynamic range, clever riffs, and newfound melodic focus, is likely to ensnare the youth of today the same way its spiritual predecessor lured in the young heshers of old.</p></div>"|18446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18446-exhumed-necrocracy/|7.5|Kim Kelly

He sings (see his star-making debut on Rocky’s “Kissin’ Pink”), he can write (take his bendy, gleeful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15689-aap-ferg-shabba-ft-aap-rocky/"">“Shabba”</a>), and he’s weird-- when he’s feeling purple, he channels his inner Fergenstein, a lewder, more hedonistic persona. He also talks big: “I wanna be as known as Jesus,” he told me earlier this year, later mentioning his affinity for artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Warhol. (Sounds like he’d enjoy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovG6itQcd2A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z’s bathroom</a>). He’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXZxipry6kE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">funny</a>, he’s <a href=""http://traplord.myshopify.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">got a peculiar style</a>, and he’s got, for a lack of a better word, a sizeable amount of swag. Like Rocky, he's a uniter of rap audiences and regional sounds, the only other performer in the A$AP crew who’s exhibited that star-like sheen so far. If he were to deliver on that promise with a debut that properly channeled all the potential... next stop, stratosphere.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Trap Lord</i>, Ferg’s debut mixtape turned debut album, probably isn’t that record, though it has quite a few bright spots. While it begins with a fierce, feverish bundle of tracks-- the hulking, patois-smeared “Let It Go”, the infectious knocker “Shabba”, the emotional, mythologizing “Hood Pope”-- it’s also listless in spots, too reliant on underdeveloped ideas. Some of that can be chalked up to the nature of the record's existence-- like <i>Flockaveli</i>, it was originally conceptualized as a mixtape and only later was transformed into a major label debut. But a fair chunk of <i>Trap Lord</i> finds Ferg trying to figure himself out in real-time-- a natural shape shifter, he never stays in the same form for long, switching personalities and flows at the drop of a hat. Where it’s effective on songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15806-aap-ferg-hood-pope/"" target=""_blank"">“Hood Pope”</a> and the thundering opener “Let It Go”, it’s less so on scatterbrained songs like “Fergivicous” and “Make a Scene”. For an artist drawing effortlessly from what seems to be a wellspring of creativity and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZpsn2j5JH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thoughtful tribute</a>, <i>Trap Lord</i> can, at times, feel underdeveloped and skeletal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But, that’s not to suggest that <i>Trap Lord </i>doesn’t <i>sound</i> great-- A$AP Mob still has the best ears in town. The production is leering and paranoid but rippled with muscle. It’s a dark-tinted record, to be sure, sonically and lyrically. The VERYRVRE-produced “Hood Pope” chronicles the loss of a young child; “Murder Something” uses a Kirk Franklin analogy to underscore a particular, graphic ass-kicking; the closing, experimental “Cocaine Castle” uses a crack house as the setting, a location where the protagonist sees “doctors in their suits”, babies, his mom. It’s heavy shit, reinforced by thick, tense production from under-the radar producers like Frankie P, P on the Boards, Snugsworth and HighDefRazjah. The stormy sonic texture is the backbone that the album aligns itself along, a logical combination of Cleveland smoke (Bone Thugs-N-Harmony incidentally show up on ""Lord""), Death Row menace, and classic New York rap radio that's perfectly tailored to A$AP Ferg's reverential package.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When <i>Trap Lord</i> flashes-- Ferg’s speed-it-up-slow-it-down verse on “Work” is pure thrill-- it’s brilliant. But despite its status as his commercial debut, it's easiest to approach it as a low-stakes introduction to Ferg, an artist who, like Rocky and other newcomers like Travi$ Scott, has the ability to push the boundaries of the genre toward more experimental sounds and ideas. Though <i>Trap Lord</i>'s vision is refracted through split personalities-- for better or for worse-- A$AP Ferg still sounds like a star in the making.</p></div>"|17921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17921-aap-ferg-trap-lord/|7.5|Corban Goble

Not only are there commissions to be written and personal works to be performed, but there are musicians, academic directors, tony labels, demanding benefactors, and gala-happy chamber arts societies to be placated. Not only is there the classical canon and instrumentation to be managed; there are also all kinds of electronic devices and experiments to be integrated, not infrequently amid multidisciplinary performance settings. And if navigating this demanding new music world isn't enough, there's the indie one it increasingly mingles with, sending you scampering between campus auditoriums and nightclub stages.</p>
<p>Scottish composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30651-anna-meredith/"">Anna Meredith</a> knows what it's like to keep such a complex machine of prestige and exigency humming along. She has been a composer-in-residence at the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. She's made <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo97ztKppIw#action=share"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">classically trained young people perform</a> something like a goofy symphonic version of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcFyl8amoEE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich’s <i>Clapping Music</i></a> at Royal Albert Hall. She's padded her income with commercial work including, reportedly, music for MRI scanners. That's a terrifying prospect if you consider it through the lens of her solo style, which is shaping up-- understandably, given the aforementioned context-- as a pressure vent for overwhelming, spontaneous, brazen grandeur. Would you want to hear Death Star explosion music while getting your brain scanned in a metal pod?</p>
<p>Meredith unveiled her smart, intrepid electronic music last year on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17400-black-prince-fury/""><i>Black Prince Fury</i> EP</a>, which was steeped in a sense of adventure associated with the fantasy video games and fantasy metal of the 1980s, when Meredith was a child. The EP was spearheaded by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14090-nautilus/"">""Nautilus""</a>, a sentient tidal wave of synthetic brass pulses more gloriously malevolent than anything cooked up by TNGHT or ripped off the <i>Godzilla</i> soundtrack by Pharoahe Monch. ""I came up with a bit of it, and thought, 'Well, that's a bit ridiculous, but let's just roll with it!'"" Meredith <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9154-anna-meredith/"">told </a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9154-anna-meredith/"">Pitchfork</a><i>. </i>On the new <i>Jet Black Raider</i> EP, she adds some real clarinets, glockenspiels, drums, cello, and even singing to her virtual instruments, but otherwise, she picks up in the same retro-flavored, high-spirited, questing mood where she left off.</p>
<p>The 8-bit video game scores of the 80s were influenced by medieval music-- its limited polyphony suited the handful of channels you could get on a chip-- and by hair metal guitar solos, for their built-in adrenaline. Video game composers used these channels as maximally as possible, stuffing them with ghoulish chromatic bass lines, runaway arpeggios, and memorably brave or haunting melodic themes. Meredith's solo work feels couched in this dated techno-cultural moment. Her song titles sound like <i>Zelda</i> monsters; her EP names like <i>Final Fantasy</i> summon spells. With the short hair and puffy shirt she wears in promo photos, she would make a great bard at a LARP session. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15691-orlok/"">""Orlok""</a>, which fills the monstrous-banger slot established by ""Nautilus"", begins with a fast sinister progression that makes you feel like you've booted up <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ9xwkMr3e4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wizards &amp; Warriors</a></i>, then rampages through seven minutes of explosive final-boss music, but with contemplative respites and beats nudged around in time.   </p>
<p>As on <i>Black Prince Fury</i>, the new EP's initial shock-and-awe campaign is rounded out by three shorter, lighter pieces, though the mercurial ""Unicron""-- imagine if there was such a thing as a pipe organ with a built-in digital sequencer, and it was totally haunted-- nears ""Orlok"" in groaning weight and playful menace, and often feels, as do many of Meredith's tracks, like the brief moment when an orchestra scrambles for a tempo change protracted for a breathlessly long time. The sparse <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15828-bubble-gun/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">""Bubble Gun""</a> is as quirkily schematic as its name, with effervescent arpeggios for bubbles, a bass and some brass chords for the gun. Most surprising is ""ALR"", where Meredith sings ingenuous lyrics in a clear, humble voice over molten electro-pop, melding the breezniess of Au Revoir Simone with the wide-open thrusters of M83. </p>
<p>Certainly, Meredith must share Anthony Gonzalez's love of 80s synth-pop; this is someone who twisted apart ""The Power of Love"" on her last EP. But rather than a nostalgic embalming of old feelings, this is rough and ready music that bursts with contemporary inspiration, aiming to flood the synapses and master the senses. Though musical subtleties naturally emerge from Meredith's training and practice, the extroverted impact and unserious charisma of <i>Jet Black Raider</i> is even more admirable and rare.</p></div>"|18393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18393-anna-meredith-jet-black-raider-ep/|7.6|Brian Howe

It captures the pick-up-and-play directness of her songwriting while leaving out a whole other dimension: the formal distance and art-music aesthetics she brings to her albums. It's not that Veirs' songs-- where vestiges of jazz and blues enrich a sparse, rocky soil of folk and country-- couldn't be beat out on an acoustic guitar at a coffeehouse. But they would lose something crucial without their arrangements; a malleable sense of time and place. And not many coffeehouse singer/songwriters have recorded for Nonesuch or worked with jazz greats such as Bill Frisell and Brian Blade. Blade, Wayne Shorter's genius drummer, is but one of the illustrious guests on <i>Warp and Weft</i>, Veirs’ new album of sinewy, elemental songs, overcast with the anxieties of motherhood.</p>
<p>""Overcast"" is nearly a constant in Veirs' music, which is easy to connect to her vantage from the Pacific Northwest. But more than Portland skies, <i>Warp and Weft</i> conjures a low, angular desert with percussion like rattlesnakes, guitars like scorpion stings, and pedal steels and string bends like reeling stars, all reverberating into shrouded gray distances. Veirs' voice runs through as clear and even as moonlight. With husband and long-time producer Tucker Martine, she fleshes out her wind-scoured terrain with pearly swirls of keyboard, a bit of mandolin and viola, some ruminative piano and organ. An electric guitar glints like mica chips from the woozily pitched terrain of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15539-laura-veirs-sun-song/"">""Sun Song""</a>, where Veirs alternates her breathiest and flintiest vocal timbres with shivery results. American music history is a ghostly presence: Jazz pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane is feted, strangely enough, with zooming guitar rock, and you know they had a harp around because it appears on ""White Cherry"", an unabashedly jazz number with a lush sax and big soft cymbals and chromatic organ vamps.  </p>
<p><i>Warp and Weft</i> was recorded while Veirs was eight months pregnant, and inklings of ambient violence, unthinkable abandonment, and maternal isolation toughen up her mannered idylls of the natural world. On ""Dorothy of the Island"", she belts out a snippet of a ""Motherless Children"", a folk song that's been recorded by everyone from Roseanne Cash to Eric Clapton. ""Dorothy of the island fell into a well inside her head,"" Veirs adds in her own words, developing a stirring vocal melody over a softly ringing bed of electric guitar and keyboard. On the churning ""America"", she stares down an ominous country where ""everyone's packing heat."" And ""Sadako Folding Cranes"" enshrines a child who survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in a music-box shanty topped off with forlorn whistling, dispensing with several affectations at once.</p>
<p>At worst, Veirs can be a mite precious: You couldn't think up a better Decemberists parody title than ""Finster Saw the Angels"", which is about the folk artist who painted the cover of R.E.M.'s <i>Reckoning</i>. But the delicately chained unison of the guitar and vocal melodies makes for a standout passage in a record that feels fresher and sharper than we've heard from Veirs in awhile, and perhaps serves as the dark flipside of children's record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16105-tumble-bee/""><i>Tumble Bee</i></a>.</p></div>"|18188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18188-laura-veirs-warp-and-weft/|7.4|Brian Howe

Stevie Moore’s body of work is unmanageably vast. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5609-conscientious-objector/"">One estimate</a> put his discography at over 400 releases, and that was a decade ago. But there’s a simple contradiction running through all of it. On one hand, Moore is the prototypical outsider, mostly home-recording his idiosyncratic tunes since the early 1970’s. Yet he’s also a kind of hyper-insider. Born in Nashville to a session-musician <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Moore"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">father</a>, he has long explored many established genres, including pop, rock, classical, funk, metal, even hip-hop. Maybe it’s best to think of him as an outsider looking in. His work reveres the history of American popular music, yet his methods prove you can make an original contribution to that canon without bending to commercial conventions.</p>
<p>Not that Moore wouldn’t welcome popularity. In fact, his music often struggles with the temptations and frustrations of chasing success and fame. One example opens <i>Personal Appeal,</i> a compilation culled from three decades of his mail-order “Cassette Club” series. It’s called “Why Can’t I Write a Hit?”, which Moore must mean as at least half a joke-- he clearly can write catchy hooks and choruses, and he knows it. His music is so full of them sometimes you wonder if they’re the only thing in his brain.</p>
<p>Maybe what Moore really is asking is, “Why can’t I write a <i>simple </i>hit?” Because on that song and many of his others, his melodies can include bracing time-changes, bizarre left turns, hard cuts to dissonance, and stirring moments of reflection. (Or, as he puts it bluntly at end of the track, “The songs are too weird.”) Moore rarely keeps things simple for an entire tune, and while that’s made his music hard to sell, it’s also made it interesting. He knows this, too-- as he told <i>The Wire </i>last year, “I wish I wasn’t so desperate, and yet I’m damned glad I’m so desperate because it kept me innocent and not a bullshit artist.”</p>
<p>Moore’s aversion to easy solutions-- alongside his obsession with diverse musical styles-- can make listening to him a whiplash-inducing challenge. The tonal shifts come hard and fast, and I often find myself skipping over a few tracks on any given Moore album, especially the more precious pieces whose novelty can be hard to see beyond. But his high-speed unpredictability is ultimately thrilling, and delivers lots of payoffs. You can approach his music the way Mark Twain advised dealing with the weather in New England: if you don’t like it, just wait a few minutes.</p>
<p>You can also wait until the next time Moore devotees pick gems from his back catalogue to reissue. Right now is a particularly good period: alongside Care in the Community’s <i>Personal Appeal</i>, Brooklyn’s Personal Injury-- a label that’s so far <a href=""http://personalinjury.storenvy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">solely focused</a> on Moore records-- has reissued 1978’s <i>Delicate Tension </i>and 1986’s <i>Glad Music</i>. All three offer solid entry points into Moore’s oeuvre, and the fact that I’m not sure which to recommend first is testament to how tireless Moore is. There are ups and downs on each, but you never get the sense that he’s phoning anything in. He’s made hundreds of albums because he wants to, not because anyone expected or demanded it.</p>
<p>Of these three records <i>Personal Appeal </i>is naturally the most diverse. It offers sides of Moore not often seen elsewhere, like the old-timey crooner of “Quarter Peep Show”, the space-age balladeer of “Man Without a Purpose”, and the looney-tunes rapper of “Forecast”. There are some straighter pop gems too, but the overall variety makes <i>Personal Appeal</i> one of the more dizzying Moore releases-- a considerable feat given how predisposed he is to changing things up.</p>
<p>In comparison, <i>Delicate Tension </i>and <i>Glad Music </i>are more consistent. The latter offers the most shoulda-hit tracks, such as the new-wavey <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1MfeLx6Uds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I Like to Stay Home”</a> and the riff-happy <a href=""http://youtu.be/wUKltpvOPmg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Part of the Problem”.</a> It also has a healthy share of requisite oddball ditties and brain-fired experiments. <i>Delicate Tension</i> goes a bit deeper. In many places across its 14 tracks, Moore gives humor and seriousness equal weight without letting either cancel the other out. It might be overdramatic to say that during tunes like the bouncing “Funny Child” or the “I Go Into Your Mind” (wherein Moore declares “I swim upon your tears”) you won’t know whether to laugh or cry. But Moore certainly knows how to make heavy subjects hilarious and make funny lines moving, in a way matched by few (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain Beefheart</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29654-eugene-chadbourne/"">Eugene Chadbourne</a> come to mind).</p>
<p>Both <i>Delicate Tension </i>and <i>Glad Music </i>include some skit-like transitions that give them the feel of an amateur radio show (Moore often employs that style when crafting albums; he even spent time in the early 80s as a DJ on the great freeform station<a href=""http://wfmu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> WFMU</a>). In that sense, they sound almost as much like compilations as <i>Personal Appeal</i> does. But then most R. Stevie Moore albums do, and that’s a big part of his charm.

Stevie Moore’s body of work is unmanageably vast. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5609-conscientious-objector/"">One estimate</a> put his discography at over 400 releases, and that was a decade ago. But there’s a simple contradiction running through all of it. On one hand, Moore is the prototypical outsider, mostly home-recording his idiosyncratic tunes since the early 1970’s. Yet he’s also a kind of hyper-insider. Born in Nashville to a session-musician <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Moore"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">father</a>, he has long explored many established genres, including pop, rock, classical, funk, metal, even hip-hop. Maybe it’s best to think of him as an outsider looking in. His work reveres the history of American popular music, yet his methods prove you can make an original contribution to that canon without bending to commercial conventions.</p>
<p>Not that Moore wouldn’t welcome popularity. In fact, his music often struggles with the temptations and frustrations of chasing success and fame. One example opens <i>Personal Appeal,</i> a compilation culled from three decades of his mail-order “Cassette Club” series. It’s called “Why Can’t I Write a Hit?”, which Moore must mean as at least half a joke-- he clearly can write catchy hooks and choruses, and he knows it. His music is so full of them sometimes you wonder if they’re the only thing in his brain.</p>
<p>Maybe what Moore really is asking is, “Why can’t I write a <i>simple </i>hit?” Because on that song and many of his others, his melodies can include bracing time-changes, bizarre left turns, hard cuts to dissonance, and stirring moments of reflection. (Or, as he puts it bluntly at end of the track, “The songs are too weird.”) Moore rarely keeps things simple for an entire tune, and while that’s made his music hard to sell, it’s also made it interesting. He knows this, too-- as he told <i>The Wire </i>last year, “I wish I wasn’t so desperate, and yet I’m damned glad I’m so desperate because it kept me innocent and not a bullshit artist.”</p>
<p>Moore’s aversion to easy solutions-- alongside his obsession with diverse musical styles-- can make listening to him a whiplash-inducing challenge. The tonal shifts come hard and fast, and I often find myself skipping over a few tracks on any given Moore album, especially the more precious pieces whose novelty can be hard to see beyond. But his high-speed unpredictability is ultimately thrilling, and delivers lots of payoffs. You can approach his music the way Mark Twain advised dealing with the weather in New England: if you don’t like it, just wait a few minutes.</p>
<p>You can also wait until the next time Moore devotees pick gems from his back catalogue to reissue. Right now is a particularly good period: alongside Care in the Community’s <i>Personal Appeal</i>, Brooklyn’s Personal Injury-- a label that’s so far <a href=""http://personalinjury.storenvy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">solely focused</a> on Moore records-- has reissued 1978’s <i>Delicate Tension </i>and 1986’s <i>Glad Music</i>.

It was the sort of first record that came with immediately apparent strengths and weaknesses: the band's knack for spindly, easily melodic guitar hooks was evident, but counteracted by lyrical conceits that ran the gamut from immature to disgusting. The grotesquerie climaxed, quite literally, on the back-half of ""T-Shirts,"" a song that hinges on its narrative participants engaging in a sort of barter involving bodily fluids.</p>
<p><span>The band's new record, <i>Mourning Trance</i>, is grappling with weightier issues, drawn from the deaths of one member's parents and a close friend of the group. The series of traumas inspired the record's title, which refers to the natural struggle to continue on with our lives and duties in the face of loss. And while newfound maturity and thematic concerns borne out of personal problems are not foolproof indicators of musical quality, <i>Mourning Trance</i> is a major step forward from the debut on multiple fronts.</span></p>
<p><span>Vocalist Brendan Saarinen has described album opener ""Burial Suit"" as a ""starting point"" for <i>Mourning Trance</i>, and it's easy to imagine the band in the studio playing the track back and realizing they'd struck a vein. It's a fantastic song, nicely textured and ringing with anthemic ambition. It's also notable for its sense of scale and pace: a guitar line that might've previously been pushed to the foreground is relegating to a role of an atmospheric backing whine, and a vault into a climactic round of full-band vocals feels organic and well deserved. The song finds solid lyrical footing, too, with Saarinen struggling to get out of bed so he can piece his life back together.</span></p>
<p><span>The band manages to sustain the momentum generated by ""Burial Suit"" over <i>Mourning Trance</i>'s first half. “Dancing Spines” lives up to its title, quickly driving forward with jittery percussion and a viscous bass line, and the title track hides a potentially dark sentiment underneath a sweet vocal melody as Saarinen chants, “I don’t wanna see it when you wake up.” These songs share a refreshing guitar-related restraint: where the best tracks on <i>Girls Come Too</i> possessed little to recommend other than memorable leads, even less successful <i>Mourning Trance</i> cuts offer a new emphasis on other elements, from splashy and engaging rhythmic sections to buzzing synths like those on lead single “In Enemies”. The guitar parts are still worth commending, but they're not the sole reasons for each song's existence. </span></p>
<p>The album does falter a bit at the back end of its second half, closing with a set of songs that are propped up by one or two good ideas but lack the tight construction and craft of earlier cuts. Take ""Deer Hologram"", for instance: an introductory riff worthy of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"" target=""_blank"">Smashing Pumpkins</a> C-side circa <i>Siamese Dream</i> and a decent ""dear/deer"" homophone pun are appealing, but their delivery mechanism is far from indelible. That said, it's easy to gloss over a few missteps in light of the leap Still Life Still have taken.</p></div>"|18383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18383-still-life-still-mourning-trance/|6.6|Jamieson Cox

Last December, the singer and guitarist's adopted father died after a long battle with cancer, and shortly after, Segall stopped speaking to his mother. (He doesn't go into detail in interviews, saying only ""she did some bad stuff."") <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2013/08/08/210232983/ty-segall-live-listening-party"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Speaking to NPR</a>, he called this period of his life a ""weird, intense time,"" and <i>Sleeper </i>is a document of what came out of him in that moment. ""It was kind of a purge, to be honest,"" he said.</p>
<p>Gone is the brazen, screaming Segall behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/""><i>Slaughterhouse</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14347-melted/""><i>Melted</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17133-twins/""><i>Twins</i></a>. Even the relatively sedate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/""><i>Goodbye Bread</i></a>, with its <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rglalj2UwA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exploding heads</a> and angry <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NMcqRfxthc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">California commercials</a>, featured a more intense Segall than the one who made <i>Sleeper</i>. ""When I was making [<i>Sleeper</i>], I couldn't have written a loud, heavy song if somebody had paid me to,"" he <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/4211638/ty-segall-goes-acoustic-confronts-family-loss-in-psych-folk-sleeper"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. Instead, he picked up his acoustic guitar and made something that owes less to Sabbath and more to Tyrannosaurus Rex-era Marc Bolan or early Bert Jansch. The title track opens quietly with a whistle, and slowly, he strums a minor chord progression louder and louder. ""Oh sleeper/ My dreamer/ I dream a dream for you,"" he sings. It's a gentle track that Segall said was initially written for his slumbering girlfriend, but <i>Sleeper</i>'s much weightier symbolic connotations of sleeping and dreaming hang heavy over the album.</p>
<p>While the album's tone and pacing seem to reflect its initial inspiration, the lyrics are rarely confessional in the most explicit sense-- any references to Segall's personal life are cloaked in more broadly relatable terms. Occasionally specific details pop out (""He packed his bags this morning/ He bought his ticket today/ Don't you go away/ Not today,"" he sings on ""She Don't Care""), and he gets slightly more blunt with ""Crazy"", which is sung to a ""little one,"" offering comfort because ""He's here/ He's still here/ Though she is crazy."" Segall said that ""Crazy"" was written spontaneously the moment he recorded it-- something he's never done before-- about his mother. ""It’s kind of that thing where a person crosses a line and you just snap,"" he said. ""You hit a point where you don’t care how it affects that person because you just have to say it so you can move on."" The way he talks about the song, it's easy to imagine a diatribe, but it's a catchy, sweet, two-and-a-half minute song with a lyrical twist. For all its personal significance, ""Crazy"" is as open-ended as Segall's best songs. </p>
<p>So after all his shrieking, shredding, and psychedelic freakouts last year, <i>Sleeper </i>offers a welcome sonic respite. It's easily his most stripped down effort to date, full of elegantly simple, catchy, well-crafted songs. And although everything's acoustic, aside from one well-placed electric solo near the end of ""The Man Man"", the album's packed with subtle diversity. While ""6th Street"" recalls the more psychedelic-leaning folk he made with Tim Presley on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16558-ty-segall-white-fence-hair/""><i>Hair</i></a>, ""The West"" could've been plucked from the rambling Carter Family songbook. Then there's ""Queen Lullabye"", with its distant-sounding falsetto, sludgy guitar, droning low-end, and trudging-through-molasses pace.</p>
<p>But even when he's switching things up on <i>Sleeper</i>, the album never feels as scatterbrained as his previous work. <i>Goodbye Bread </i>opened with a sing-songy ballad and went straight into a shout. <i>Twins</i> featured psychedelia and garage pop. <i>Melted</i> had acoustic-driven catchiness and blown-out fuzz. Those albums could pull off a scattershot of styles with well-placed transitions, but <i>Sleeper </i>is something else. Everything here easily lives in the same universe-- 10 tracks of similarly hued songs, all of a piece. It's his most focused album, with every song's tone easily flowing into the next, and it's also one of his best. </p></div>"|18398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18398-ty-segall-sleeper/|8.2|Evan Minsker

Hawkwind, so his teenaged self reasoned, was more conducive to his <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> lifestyle and its fixation on all things mystic, cosmic, and denim-jacketed. Punk was about confrontation; Hawkwind was about escapism. At the same time, Barrowcliffe glosses over the basic irony: Many early punk bands, including the Stranglers and the Damned, were influenced by Hawkwind-- and Hawkwind could rage as ferociously as their punk cousins, even when singing about psychedelic warlords and space rituals.</p>
<p>For <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15703-destruction-unit-the-world-on-drugs/"" target=""_blank"">Destruction Unit</a>, this is all so much false dichotomy. The Arizona collective’s sophomore album, <i>Deep Trip</i>, is spacey. And it’s punky. And it refuses to acknowledge that there’s anything remotely untoward about that particular alchemy of elements. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17745-destruction-unit-void/"" target=""_blank""><i>Void</i></a>, released earlier this year, showed glints of this shimmering space-punk alloy, but it hadn’t quite cohered and hardened. That’s understandable; although the band came together a decade ago, while frontman Ryan Rousseau was serving in the Reatards-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Reatard</a> and his Lost Sounds bandmate Alicja Trout were original members of D-Unit back then-- the group’s current lineup is relatively new. The scrambled, scratchy shakiness of <i>Void</i> has given way to a sound that’s far more focused, corralled, and even refined in its primal ergonomics of paranoia. Chaos abounds, but it’s been funneled into <i>Deep Trip</i>’s streamlined and astrodynamic pulse.</p>
<p>As pulses go, it’s still an erratic one. One of Rousseau’s strengths is knowing the difference between being spacey and being droning; although <i>Deep Trip</i> tracks such as “Slow Death Sounds” and “Final Flight” are brutally, brain-poundingly simple, their riffs don’t lapse into repetition for the sake of repetition. There’s some deceptively catchy and even classic songwriting going on, as one might expect from an ex-Reatard. Here, though, those caveman hooks are given an even more corroded crust of gunk, howl, and echo. On “Control the Light”, Rousseau gulps for air in some bug-eyed trance, like Lux Interior’s last gasp stuck in a near-death-experience loop. Grinding washes of wah pedal and modulated distortion evoke misanthropic freakouts and crises of pataphysical identity, and the low throb of motorik locomotion creeps in to calm the spasms.</p>
<p>The chemical formula is a familiar one to Hawkwind cultists. But “The World On Drugs” and “God Trip” are far less merciless in their cenophobic contemplation of the emptiness of space, both inner and outer. Rousseau and crew are shoveling noise like frantic androids to fill the void, a process of proto-industrial dehumanization that mirrors Chrome at their most savage and severe. But where Chrome-- and their closest contemporaries, Hawkwind-- skirted punk, Destruction Unit embraces it, sticking everything from garage slop to hardcore convulsion into its nihilistic nightmare fantasy. But in the same way Chrome and Hawkwind crafted eternal hymns to stellar and cellular entropy, <i>Deep Trip</i> is anything but fixed to any one time and place-- contemporary or retro. Even when the album infrequently dips into crooning, diffuse looseness on “The Holy Ghost”, there’s something more timelessly potent in the way D-Unit throttles the warp drive. If space-rock as a whole is a role-playing game, one in which its players imagine having front-row seats for the heat-death of the universe, then <i>Deep Trip</i> is the one of most advanced vehicles yet designed to take them there.</p></div>"|18382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18382-destruction-unit-deep-trip/|7.4|Jason Heller

Though on a much, <i>much </i>smaller scale, TWIABP resemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire"">Arcade Fire</a> prior to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/452-funeral/"">Funeral</a>, </i>having made their name on a promising EP and unpredictable, cathartic live performances that feature nearly a dozen people making music at the same time. But the greater similarity lies in <i>Whenever, If Ever </i>being a rare debut that’s powered by an almost frightening will to live, a desperation that strongly suggests the people involved have no other option to deal with what's inside of them-- when Thomas Diaz screams “let's hope that this works out/ this has got to work out!"" during the frantic conclusion of “Fightboat”, you realize “this” means<i> everything</i>.</p>
<p>TWIABP have already become a bit of a cause célèbre as <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/emo-twiabp-topshelf-swerp-capn-jazz-midwestern-braid-reflex/Content?oid=10550897"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">emo reemerges as a viable, visible genre of independent rock</a> rather than just a pejorative adjective. Understandable, even if there wasn’t anything like them the first time around-- for one thing, they’re from Connecticut and roll about 10 deep, switching vocalists on the fly and utilizing strings and horns to create textures that are more based in post-rock or mid-00s indie rock. And at the risk of revisionist history, I’m just going to put this out there: Cap’n Jazz, Jazz June, and all that other jazz was never this melodic, never this instrumentally tight, and never this well-produced. But if that sound meant everything to you at some point or if you’ve been waiting for a comeback for the sole purpose of airing out old grievances, <i>Whenever, If Ever </i>suits your needs.</p>
<p>They have a weakness for the emo trope of singing being the truest form of self-expression, an act even purer if you don’t have any kind of studied vocal capability-- ""we sang songs/ but we never learned your words or melodies"", ""and when our voices fail us/ we will find new ways to sing,"" things like that. And on first proper track “Heartbeat in the Brain”, TWIABP sounds like the kind of band where you get the lead vocals simply by <i>wanting it more--</i> there’s the adenoidal guy, the screaming guy, someone named ""Shitty Greg"" who might not be either of them, and they sometimes sing in tandem, initially exaggerating their hiccuping modulations to a degree that feels like trolling; you’ll know pretty quickly if you’re built for this stuff if “Kinsella” is your safe word. There are the musical cues as well-- searching arpeggios over palm-muted clean chords, spastic drum fills, nasal Casio synth leads. Hell, “Fightboat” might even cause squabbling amongst the old heads as its introductory horn line recalls the one from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJieIEStd4c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American Football’s “The Summer Ends”</a>, which some people still complain about to this day.</p>
<p>It takes a little while for <i>Whenever, If Ever </i>to get going, but once it does, TWIABP establish they are not an emo revival act, but more of a spiritual descendent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1007-danielson-famile/"">Danielson Famile</a> or an early 00s Saddle Creek band, a <i>community </i>whose albums serve as a time capsule, a documentation of their lives. It’s unclear exactly when that click happens, but it’s definitely during “Picture of a Tree That Doesn't Look Okay”. Perhaps it’s the part where Greg Horbal asks over desiccated, detuned guitars, “Do you think the landlord’s pissed?/ We left a car parked on the lawn again”-- it’s an inside joke that doubles as a conspiratorial invitation, indicating that you’re welcome to join in and, hell, maybe you were <i>there </i>the whole time (the car ends up on the lawn again by the very next song). Or it could be the point where <i>Whenever, If Ever </i>starts to incorporate clever segues to establish a chronology and continuity to the story-- a delayed guitar resembles a bong rip as “Picture” drifts into “You Will Never Go to Space” and the final line of that song (""Did we dream when we were skeletons/ or did we just wish for our skin?"") becomes foreshadowing for “The Layers of Skin We Drag Around”. Or, maybe it’s after the pace picks up and TWIABP shake off the slowcore rust, a drum roll crescendo leading into a rousing call and response coda where the hooks work out their kinks and become singalongs.</p>
<p>Either way, once “Picture” passes, TWIABP already have accrued the confidence and wisdom to do things they seemed incapable of only minutes prior. “Ultimate Steve” distills the band’s post-rock and emo extremes into concentrate, an all-together-now, 30-second shoutalong bookended by a gorgeous build and fade. During the revolutionary final third, the stakes and consequences of this life pursuit start to push back on TWIABP. “Gig Life” bears the record’s most instantly memorable melody and lyrics, an acoustic power ballad that would’ve been intolerable if performed with the same abandon from earlier. Diaz sings, “You ran away/ You were afraid to make mistakes/ but that's the biggest one you made."" It’s unclear to whom it’s pointed (a former bandmate? A high school friend? An ex?) or where ""somewhere to the west, I suppose""<i> </i>even entails, it could be New York City or the next town over for all we know. But “Gig Life” establishes that TWIABP understand the sacrifices and the rewards of their chosen gig life and are saddened at losing this person, that it might be a personal failure on their behalf. Still, being stuck in West Virginia with the same old Rival Schools albums and food from the nearest Sheetz are their occupational hazards; those of your “gig” might entail water cooler talk and the occasional bagel, but it's still a gig. Are you satisfied?</p>
<p>“Low Light Assembly” follows as a solemn, final hymn (""the parking lot where we lay is more than home now"") before the stunning closer “Getting Sodas."" A brooding, minor key bassline gives you pause to realize just how far TWIABP have come in barely a half hour-- they’ve established a community, this one’s for an <i>audience.</i> And it’s big room stuff: the guitars peal and ring rather than hang and drone, the low end is heavier and reverbed, the screaming sounds aimed rather than scattershot. And it closes on a chorale that the band created itself to express: ""The world is a beautiful place/ but we have to make it that way... and if you're afraid to die/ Then so am I.""</p>
<p>Yeah, it sounds like Arcade Fire and it sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes"">Bright Eyes</a> too, but the intent of those words is more crucial. It reminds me of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_2R1rjbD8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Win Butler promising to build tunnels</a> as the world collapses around him and his lover, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIkdr64_cCo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conor Oberst demanding the tape roll</a> so that he and his friends can document their love for each other. It’s a spirit available to everyone and possessed by no one, yet so few bands choose to pursue it even as those that do tend to be rewarded-- it’s a realization that you can be ambitious and striving with kindness, pushing against a palpable resistance without turning existence into an ""us vs. them"" zero sum game. <i>Whenever, If Ever </i>fights against fears, societal expectations, preconceptions, and the metaphysical for the greater good of society, and I mean, for crying out loud, the cover just says <i>jump right in and do it</i>. And sure, TWIABP make mistakes on <i>Whenever, If Ever </i>because they’re scared of <i>not </i>doing so, but it’s flawed in a way that can make a listener feel like it’s <i>theirs</i>, something that might inspire them to make a more perfect version of it. <i>Whenever, If Ever </i>probably won't ever be <i>Funeral </i>or <i>Lifted </i>or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2642-ships"">Ships</a> </i>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13411-diary-lp2""><i>Diary </i></a>on a mass level, but you know TWIABP feel like it’s their best shot at it and don’t care whether a dozen or several thousand people end up feeling the same.</p></div>"|18423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18423-the-world-is-a-beautiful-place-i-am-no-longer-afra-whenever-if-ever/|7.8|Ian Cohen

The group’s latest full-length, <i>So You Are… So You’ll Be</i>, arrives on the heels of 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16380-frying-on-this-rock/"" target=""_blank""><i>Frying on This Rock</i></a>; in place of the seething riffage leader David W. has been stoking lately, <i>So You Are</i> tacks toward cooler climes. It’s an interesting direction for the band to take. At its best, like 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15559-hp1/"" target=""_blank""><i>H-p1</i></a>, White Hills' devotion to rock’n’roll of the intergalactic variety is fueled by the urgency of ritual abandon, a heart-pounding, pants-wetting chant in fuzz-pedal form. <i>So You Are</i>'s surfaces are not as gloriously scummy.</p>
<p>Turns out that White Hills clean up pretty nicely. That’s “clean” in the relative sense. “In Your Room” pummels and whispers simultaneously, a Dalek nursery rhyme spiked with cyborg call-and-response. The drone-propelled “Forever in Space (Enlightened)” picks up the pace, but there’s a flat-line sameness that supersedes White Hills’ avowed homogeneity. <i>So You Are’s </i>three long instrumentals-- “The Internal Monologue”, “Rare Upon The Earth”, and “MIST (Winter)""-- are full of simulated seagull cries and new-age waterfalls, slabs of padding that swallow and obscure the album to the point where the more energetic tracks feel like the interludes. These are bland turns for a group that usually packs so much kinetic cut-and-thrust.</p>
<p>Still, there’s plenty of <i>So You Are </i>worth sinking teeth into, including the title track, which shows White Hills’ ability to do away with distended, faux-epic intros and just jump straight into the guts of the jam. “In Your Room”'s refreshingly sloppy drum rolls are used to strong effect, but an incessant sequence of sci-fi raygun noises wears out its welcome a quarter of the way through. And the screeching, minimalist breakdown at the end gets points for being the antithesis of the wild-guitar freakout, but it only adds more empty atmosphere to an album top-heavy with it. The pointless snippets of electronic bleepery, “InWords” and “OutWords,” don’t help.</p>
<p>It isn’t just a matter of volume. There’s a bestial snarl to White Hills that’s mostly missing, and nothing’s rushing in to replace it. Occasionally a hint of shoegaze filigree or kosmische bliss gets drawn into the swirl, but it’s not enough. White Hills sound best when every instrument is dialed up to “bruising” just before the control panel melts. That rarely happens here, so there are entire dimensions of texture and harmonic overload that haunt the disc with their absence. </p></div>"|18412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18412-white-hills-so-you-are-so-youll-be/|6.2|Jason Heller

It's an instant tune-in, pay-attention detail, humbling and specific and funny, right down the way it starts with ""So."" ""Goomba Pimpin"" was a calling card for Roach Gigz, introducing the world at large to a young rapper with a quick mind, an eye for the small things, and an off-the-cuff flow with a heavy debt to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>.</p>
<p>Three years later is a long, long time in unsigned-mixtape-rapper time. Between then and now, there was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15107-roachy-balboa-round-2/"" target=""_blank""><i>Roachy Balboa 2</i></a>, not quite as good, and then silence. <i>Roachy Balboa 3, </i>released this month is another strong tape brimming with Roachiness: rich writing, funny/sad jokes, rubbery Bay Area beats. But despite his bullish optimism (""I'm still young motherfucker/ I'm gonna be an actor when I'm done, motherfucker"") <i>RB3</i> still doesn't feel like the shot that will convert regional buzz to national buzz. For better or for worse, Roach seems to live in his own little self-contained universe, and the joys to be had when visiting are small ones, like a perfectly rendered image of desiccated vegetables bobbing in a cup of noodles.</p>
<p>Roach has tapped some surrounding Bay Area talent for fresh context: The first single off the tape, ""It's Lit"",  features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31412-iamsu/"" target=""_blank"">IAMSU!</a>, a Bay Area rapper/producer who is everywhere lately, and ""Crack A 40"" features Kool John, another member of IAMSU!'s extended HBK Gang. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29697-kreayshawn/"" target=""_blank"">Kreayshawn</a>, post-career apocalypse, is here, for some reason, mewing the hook to ""Pu$$y Magnet"", doing nothing for her recording career or Roach's. A few moments on the tape's front half of the tape suffer from a generic, any-hit syndrome-- there's a song called ""100 in the Fastlane"" that rhymes ""champagne"" and ""campaign"" in the chorus, for instance, a combination that prompts instant brain death.</p>
<p>The poppier moves slide off of Roach in part because he moves through them with the same hangdog slouch he brings to everything. He's not one for big poses, and his best music is built on cutting sidelong observations, little jokes, clever phrasings. Here's his version of ""I'm my own boss"": ""Forgot to tell my boss I'm sick/ it's cool, I call my own phone and say, 'Don't even trip,"" (""Vertigo""). On ""Actin Up,"" he says ""I keep gas like my Grandma keep coupons/ Eat you in two lines."" His rapping often does a neat trap-door trick, swinging from joke to yelp of pain in the space of one line: ""I'm always losing shit, my keys and my pops missing,"" he cracks on ""Sick American"".</p>
<p>On tape-closer ""Don't Forget The Gigz,"" he reminds us where he's coming from: ""I grew up on Weezy and Dreezy, baby/ I was eighteen before I heard some Jay-Z."" The ""Dreezy"" is the legendary Bay Area rap godfather Mac Dre, and it's tough to say which of these two Roach owes more to (At one point, Roach quotes a generous chunk of Lil Wayne's ""region haters"" salvo from ""Shooter,"" repurposing the sentiment for the Bay.) The best stuff on <i>RB3</i> is the stuff neatly aligned with this worldview, a mind nurtured by the alternate universe of the Bay Area rap scene and a gimlet eye that sees everything.</p></div>"|18428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18428-roach-gigz-roachy-balboa-round-3/|7.1|Jayson Greene

Though their crusade is more principled than political, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5313-no-age"">No Age</a> employ a common countercultural tactic on their third proper LP, reappropriating a derogatory term: what are you calling <i>an object</i>? This is <i>art</i>, with an intrinsic value that cannot be quantified or commoditized and society is worse off when any record is treated differently. But the irony is that it's a clever marketing tactic whether intentional or not; No Age’s music, successful as it’s been, never tells their whole story. Whether it’s the Smell, the T-shirts, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49000-no-age-protest-converse-during-converse-sponsored-show-dean-spunt-details-planned-contradictory-action/"">the </a>""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49000-no-age-protest-converse-during-converse-sponsored-show-dean-spunt-details-planned-contradictory-action/"">planned contradictory action</a>,"" Dean Spunt’s Post-Present Medium label, or anything else bearing their imprimatur, the band’s always been a multimedia affair. They are a bundle of righteous affiliations, “lifestyle music” for people who shudder at the term because their lifestyle is an <i>ethos, </i>upholding certain ideas about DIY, local scenes and anti-corporatism.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9102-no-age/"">When speaking to us earlier this year</a>, Randy Randall promised a total teardown and the time did feel right for the duo to sell high on the “dream-punk” sound they’ve cultivated since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10330-weirdo-rippers/"">Weirdo Rippers</a>. </i>Strikingly spare compared to their previous releases, <i>An Object</i> ensures the shortest distance between the listener and the songs, but with an idealistic corollary that still momentarily shifts the focus away from the music-- with Sub Pop’s blessing, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9195-no-age/"">the duo packaged and shipped the record with their own four hands</a>.<i> </i>But what’s left of No Age when you take away the “dream-“ and “-punk”? <i>An Object</i> proves that all the reverb, shrieking noise, and velocity of their past work were hardly afterthoughts or subversive tactics to disguise pop songs. They were essential and the actual mechanics of songwriting-- melody, harmony, structure, instrumental chops-- are exposed on <i>An Object</i> as something that’s far down the list of No Age’s strengths.</p>
<p>You sense that in the three year hiatus between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14688-everything-in-between/""><i>Everything in Between </i></a>and now, the songs came quickly and most of the time was spent painstakingly turning them inside out-- to mute the drums or excise them completely, use feedback as a backdrop rather than an overlay, to turn rhythms into melody, bass into treble. This is the album that might’ve better earned the title <i>Everything in Between, </i>as the songs are composed of scraps, MacGyver tricks achieved with contact mics, bass guitars, and doctored amps. Occasionally, the effort manifests in notable progress. “An Impression” has a novel rhythmic swing that could actually pass for dancehall and the miniature bumps and bleeps bleed into sighing strings-- it’s No Age’s most typical “pretty” moment, something that could sway people who don’t seek out beauty in harmonic feedback.</p>
<p>But for the most part, <i>An Object </i>consists of potential rock songs denied everything they need to actually rock<i>.</i> The minimalism doesn’t make for a fighting trim No Age-- they sound emaciated, subject to a crash diet equally fueled by asceticism and stubbornness. None of which is helped by the clammy production, which casts a green-grey, sickly pallor over <i>An Object</i> rather than clarity. On past records, Spunt’s rigid vocals could most kindly be described as “effective in context,” but freed from the obligations of beating the shit out of his drums, he shrinks in the spotlight. There aren’t vocal melodies on <i>An Object, </i>so much as 11 iterations of one note being budged until it moves in the slightest one way or the other. Meanwhile, Randall forgoes riffs for granular, ephemeral textures and rather than building tension through restraint, the lack of rhythmic, tonal or melodic variation causes the album’s midsection to drone more than their past work which <i>intended </i>to be drone music. </p>
<p>No Age attempt to compensate by making <i>An Object </i>their most lyrically direct album, and at the outset, most of Spunt’s words are pointed towards “you.” You know who “you” are-- “Who do you think you are/ trying so hard/ to make that stage/ but it’s not made that way,” “When I see you/ underneath your lies,” “You’re a broken leg/ a knife with no blade.” It’s “us vs. <i>the man, maaaan</i>” boilerplate for sure, though the generality can work in the favor of a band that’s always had a cause but not much of a rallying cry. When Spunt sings “I won’t be your generator/ you get no power from me,” odds are it’s a bird flip to corporations who co-opt underground art, gentrify scenes, and buy out idealism, or whatever. But if you don’t know the first thing about No Age’s extracurriculars, “I Won’t Be Your Generator” is a multi-purpose rager at parents, bosses, boyfriends, girlfriends, whatever’s harshing your buzz. Much like ditching the drums, it’s an obdurate artistic move that’s effective three minutes at a time. But when a band that’s taken up the role of indie’s moral compass gets stuck in the same black and white thinking on “No Ground” and “C’mon, Stimmung”, the pervasive “you” becomes a strawman version of actual No Age enemies like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45157-no-age-accuse-kings-of-leon-of-ripping-off-their-rainbow-logo-on-t-shirts/"">Kings of Leon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46915-no-age-to-headline-anti-walmart-benefit-in-la/"">Walmart</a>-- certainly worthy of derision, but too big to bother fighting back in a way that might put those principles to the test.</p>
<p>As <i>An Object </i>trudges forward, a strange and welcome change slowly occurs; you can sense No Age growing fatigued enough to let their guard down. After spending the first half of <i>An Object </i>raging against shadowy power brokers, they’ve retained their autonomy only to find out they can’t outrun their own shadows. “Running From A-Go-Go” is the first point where the drab tone matches the mood; when Spunt complains about “bullshit on the stereo,” he’s probably not taking shots at Imagine Dragons or Macklemore or anyone else specific. It’s just a mundane acknowledgement of a touring musician’s crippling boredom, abject, incapacitating loneliness and how inadequate the moral high ground from earlier can be against emotional encroachment--  “There’s no escaping when it pays your way/ I tell myself it’s one more day/ and one more night alone again.”</p>
<p>On <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11449-nouns/"">Nouns</a>, </i>Spunt shouted “with passion, it’s true!” So does the pervasive disillusionment of <i>An Object </i>make it false? Of course, not-- the subjects at hand are taken straight from Spunt and Randall’s lives, they've never dealt in fictional songwriting. But perhaps it’s too real, as you get the sense that the hot-button topics that can sustain a punk rocker through their 20s-- art vs. commerce, stability vs. freedom, underground vs. mainstream-- eventually grow tiresome and repetitive and best left to those who have the time and energy for endless debate. That doesn’t mean these conversations shouldn’t happen and perhaps <i>An Object </i>can spark a few. But as a musical document more utile and enjoyable as a conversation piece than for its intended purpose of listening, <i>An Object </i>sadly lives up to its own name.</p></div>"|18325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18325-no-age-an-object/|6.2|Ian Cohen

The smart business decision for someone in his place would have been to reach out and grab up some of the offers from A-plus-list rappers and Miley Cyruses that have probably been stacking up in his manager’s inbox. Instead, Montagnese has taken the more unorthodox path of releasing an album of challenging electronic music that’s also an adaptation of Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i>. It's also set in space. It’s not the most marketable decision he could have made.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>History of Man</i> is an album designed to defy expectations, which can be frustrating because most of the fairly reasonable expectations Montagnese’s well-established fan base had for his debut solo album-- simply more of the same nocturnal, narcotic slow jams that have until now constituted his entire catalog-- would have made for a perfectly good record, or possibly even a great one. What we get instead is kind of a mess, but to its credit, it’s a fascinating one.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Adapting Milton’s masterpiece as an instrumental electronic album is an ambitious task, but ambition is one thing Montagnese doesn’t seem to lack. Everything about <i>History of Man</i> is a challenge to himself and his audience, from the harsh synth patches to the partsy songwriting, all the way down to the lengthy liner notes that juxtapose a sci-fi retelling of Satan’s (or rather “prisoner #870729’s”) prideful revolt with images that blend classical European art with iconography inspired by NASA’s Voyager probes.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s a far different way of working than Montagnese is known for. His collaborations with the Weeknd are sometimes abrasive, but they’re always aimed at seducing their audience. On <i>History</i> he’s more than willing to risk alienating listeners for the sake of following his most experimental instincts. Some of his gambits pay off nicely, like interrupting the slow ambient accretion of the opening track, “One Dreamy Hum"", with glitchy snippets of noise jump-cut in at unexpected moments. Others, like the aggro drum &amp; bass pastiche “A Strange World"", are less successful.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>History</i>’s best moments come when he’s not playing against type. Songs like “One Dreamy Hum” and “Farewell” showcase his talents for creating deeply fascinating sonic textures that work just fine without a vocalist, or even a beat, for that matter. The first minute and a half of “War” is a tense amalgam of dissonant sound design and post-hip-hop rhythms that doesn’t need the liner notes to suggest dystopian sci-fi. But Montagnese can’t seem to resist the urge to overwork things. “Hum” and “Farewell” both eventually pick up beats near their ends that spoil the mood that they had set so nicely, and after that flawless 90 seconds “War” takes a totally unnecessary turn into dubsteppy post-rock.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s hard not to respect Montagnese’s enthusiasm for upending his own trademark aesthetic and recklessly exploring new ground, but in the process <i>History</i> sacrifices too much of the pleasures that his trademark offers. Ambition can be an admirable virtue, but it has a way of getting out of hand, and ultimately turning self-destructive. Somebody wrote a really good poem about that once. </span></p></div>"|18409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18409-illangelo-history-of-man/|5.9|Miles Raymer

""Are we having fun?"" lead singer Julia Shapiro asks repeatedly on ""Seattle Party"", and <i>No Regerts</i> is a great album by smart kids who are smart enough to understand how pressing that question is.</p>
<p>The vibe on <i>No Regerts</i> (the typo is intentional) is sprightly and relaxed. The members taught themselves their instruments, and you can hear uncertain hands and excellent, sophisticated ears in their playing. Lydia Lund's rhythm guitar is slightly hiccupy but confident; Gretchen Grimm's drumming is simple, but patient and sensitive and casually slack, like drumming is just one of several things she's doing at that moment. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15808-black-sail/"" target=""_blank"">""Black Sail""</a> and ""Seattle Party"", her soft puff of a beat stretches the song out pleasingly in the center, like the band is all crowded in the middle of a trampoline.  <i></i></p>
<p><i>No Regerts</i> breathes some of the same untroubled air as the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a> album; it would sound excellent listened to from a pool raft. Lead singer Julia Shapiro has things on her mind, though, and her lyrics are often sharply humorous. Everything she says is so obnoxious, funny, and sad, but she's never mean: ""Your tattoos are so deep/ They really make me think/ And your life has been so rough/ You've really been through so much,"" she deadpans on ""Seattle Party"". Her mockery is the gentle kind that actually might be aimed at drawing someone out: ""If you dance, if you dance, the girls won't give you a chance/ you're a real cool guy, you won't look us in the eye,"" she teases. You get the sense the narrator wouldn't mind if the guy decided to start dancing.</p>
<p>You can hear the same goofily sarcastic warm spirit  in the politics-of-sport-fucking ""James Dean"",  (""Oh boy, when I fuck you, you make me feel like a prostitute/ yeah, when you fuck me, I make you feel just like James Dean."") And then sometimes she is gleefully puerile; there is a song called ""Giant Vagina"", and you suspect the chance to shout the chorus might the only reason the song exists. On ""Nip Slip"", she whispers the title like it's ""Je T'aime"", and then helpfully adds, ""I can see your nips."" There are silly moments on <i>No Regerts</i> that cut down on its replayability, but there are also dusky, gorgeous songs like ""Black Sail"" and ""Happiness"", which latch onto and hold a pink-skies melancholy for their running time. The album's slightness is part of its overall appeal, though. <i>No Regerts</i> sounds young and callow and smart and horny all at the same time. Playing it feels like a night out. </p></div>"|18426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18426-chastity-belt-no-regrets/|7.5|Jayson Greene

Rappers who have shown an ability to ride such volatile trains-- where the loops are twisted, split, difficult to get a feel for-- are few and far between. But when a wordsmith, someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29674-blu/"" target=""_blank"">Blu</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/"" target=""_blank"">Open Mike Eagle</a>, is able to keep their balance, the music that results can be thrilling, a rapper dodging the obstacles of the noise underneath with breathtaking lyrical agility.</p>
<p>The Chicago producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30428-jeremiah-jae/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Jeremiah Jae</a> is yet another artist in thrall to the genre's forefathers-- an early Jae project was a Dilla tribute, <i>Eating Donuts &amp; Other Refined Foods--</i> and<i> </i>like many of his peers, he also deigns to rap. On his first album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17001-raw-money-raps/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""><i>Raw Money Raps</i></a>, he figured out a nice hack, pasting popsicle-stick lyrics onto warped, interesting beats. In an inversion of the norm, the raps became the consistent through-line, a dependable factor which allowed for the beats to bubble underneath. But on<i> Bad Jokes</i>, his new release from Warp records, Jae pulls back on his production in order to give his rapping a little more of the spotlight. The result is a compromised tape that doesn’t leave enough room for the production skills of a musician who’s a far better producer than he is a lyricist.</p>
<p>With a running time under thirty minutes, <i>Bad Jokes</i> is comparable to the beat tapes which Jeremiah Jae came up listening to, and like the best of those tapes, the album’s sound is nicely cohesive. Tracks like ""Pervert"" and ""Soul Yoga (Indian Man)"" (produced by frequent collaborator Oliver the 2nd) should give the listener a good idea-- the vibe is mussed-up and chilled out, heady at points, but never tough enough to give the record much bite. Even contributions from outré producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30131-jonwayne/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Jonwayne</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> snap into line, with pleasant, well-chosen loops that don’t present Jae with much of a challenge.</p>
<p>Jae’s raps are competent, but unfocused. They don’t concentrate on any particular subject matter, hopping topics <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">DOOM</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Cam’ron</a> style, without the kind of internal rhyme magic that made those rappers’ rambles so entertaining. His best songs here, like that Flying Lotus contribution, ""Oatmeal Face"", have him finding pockets and keeping steady but there’s not much content-wise that can hold a listener’s attention. </p>
<p>There are two exceptions, which point in different directions for Jae to take his music.  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=guns+and+butt"" target=""_blank"">""Guns and Butter""</a>, maintains the instrumental style of the album with a pleasant little vocal loop but Jae elevates his flow a few degrees, stretching himself impressively on a project where it often feels as if he’s barely working at all. The title track sounds more like something from <i>Raw Money Raps</i>, the beat whirling around underneath the boilerplate while snatches of different sounds float in and out. If Jae’s vocal contributions remain at the level they reach on ""Guns and Butter"", he’ll have to figure out how to deal with a beat like the one on ""Bad Jokes"". Otherwise, the two elements of his sound will continue to alternate in the submissive role, the rapping never rising to the level of the beats or the beats stooping to match the level of the rapping.</p></div>"|18420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18420-jeremiah-jae-bad-jokes/|5.6|Jonah Bromwich

With blast beats and dashing riffs that felt strangely ecstatic, <i>Sworn to the Dark</i> was an alternative universe hit parade. Its follow-up, 2010’s <i>Lawless Darkness</i>, proved that Watain could reanimate those feelings while studding the blitzes with unlikely new elements-- solos that spun out like Hawkwind, doom impasses that created new centers of gravity, symphonic moments that nodded back toward prog. Like America’s Nachtmystium, these Swedes could extract and expand upon their initial fury and potentially pick up a lot of new listeners in the process. And they invoke an intriguing element of danger, too, with their <a href=""http://www.metalteamuk.net/interview-watain.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deadpan Satanic proselytizing</a>, their ornate and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu4k4A3_N5U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inflammatory stage show</a>, and their <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Watain/Go_Fuck_Your_Jewish_%22God%22/33034"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">controversy-stoking past</a>. Watain could be their own heavy metal parking lot scene, with kids ready to run to the devil inside the arena and concerned parents ready to picket and protest outside.</p>
<p><i>The Wild Hunt</i>, Watain’s first album in three years, won’t quell any such fantasies concerning their could-be ascendance, at least for a bit. In fact, the first side of this 11-track, hour-long album brims with the sort of magnetism that first suggested this band for popularity over so many of their peers. “All That May Bleed” is a set of stops and stomps, with an introduction that begs for fists to be pumped and a rhythm section that sends every verse and chorus into a frenzy. And just ahead of a dervish guitar solo, frontman and provocateur Erik Danielsson yells “The salt of Satan in the wounds-- <i>of Christ!</i>,” hanging out the sort of Slayer-shaped totem that a few thousand fans might happily yell back at him. And “The Child Must Die” suggests an unholy trinity of Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and Bathory. Danielsson broadcasts his mortal invective over a stubborn rock’n’roll march, with the blast beats smartly reserved to enliven the breaks between the verses and the space behind the solos. Following the steady instrumental build that opens the album, <i>The Wild Hunt</i> rushes ahead as a hyperbolic, overdriven onslaught, using black metal as bait rather than barrier. </p>
<p>But more than three years have passed since the release of <i>Lawless Darkness</i>, a good chunk of which Watain spent writing and recording <i>The Wild Hunt</i>. The band built the songs for six months and recorded them for four more months in four different studios. Unfortunately, the work shows not in a string of 10 breathless Watain bruisers but instead in a series of tracks that force the band far from its onyx comfort zone. While Watain has often folded alien elements into their black metal, <i>The Wild Hunt</i> tries to fold black metal, or at least its essence, back into those other influences. The title track, for instance, is an arching dirge that takes shape around distended and dramatic guitar lines and choir-of-hell harmonies. It’s an awkward doom pose, like a tourist that knows the language of the land he’s visiting but lacks the subtlety or fluidity to engage native speakers. The first 90 seconds of closer “Holocaust Dawn” are incredible, as though Watain has forced its own basic form onto a carousel ride of horror. But the next five minutes mostly feel like a showcase for <i>other</i> heavy metal bona fides, with demented sound-art incantations brushing up against prog rock moves and thrash metal march. Outside of their element, Watain often sound simply like outsiders. They have strong interests and ideas, if not the experiences and abilities to actualize them. The effort is laudable, at least: Remember, Watain didn’t emerge as a fully formed great band, but they’ve grown into something of one. Maybe their clumsy stumbles, however public now, simply take time to perfect.</p>
<p>Watain’s most flagrant attempt to push past their expected border-- a nine-minute, lighters-up ballad called “They Rode On”-- serves as <i>The Wild Hunt</i>’s unprecedented centerpiece. Like Bob Seger’s “Turn the Page” if Metallica had recorded it in 1988 instead of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_Inc."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1998</a>, it’s a melodramatic portrayal of roving warriors on the lam, preparing for dismissal or death. While it’s symptomatic of the sickly self-conscious feeling that permeates at least half of <i>The Wild Hunt</i>, it’s also great, with Danielsson selling the role of beleaguered vagabond with the same authority he uses as seething frontman. Throughout <i>The Wild Hunt</i>, Danielsson lands some incredible phrases and images, painting his visions of Moloch and apocalypse in poetic couplets and teases. If nothing else, “They Rode On” serves as a clear showcase for his enthusiasm for Watain’s increasing intricacy. Maybe this is the song that introduces Watain to the masses. But more likely, maybe it’s just another indication of a band too restless for easy notoriety or Second Wave replications. That, at least, is more than what most everyone initially expected from Watain, The Revivalists.</p></div>"|18305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18305-watain-the-wild-hunt/|6.7|Grayson Currin

It was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>, unbelievably young (15? 16?) and skilled beyond his years, a methodical wordsmith whose splatterpunk murder fantasies were rendered all the more unsettling by his incredible poise. The video for “Earl” (off the mixtape of the same name), wherein Sweatshirt and company down a risky drug cocktail and party until they begin to decay, was integral in setting the then-unknown collective on its crash course with hip-hop notoriety. But just as Odd Future took off, Earl appeared to vanish. Once a menacing presence over Tyler’s post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"" target=""_blank"">Neptunes</a> synth wheeze, Earl was frustratingly absent from the group’s inaugural round of live shows and festival spots as well as the second round of Odd Future solo efforts. The group refused to provide an explanation for the lingering absence of its best rapper when pressed, opting instead to lead fans through a quixotic “Free Earl” campaign immortalized in t-shirts, records, and <a href=""http://passionweiss.com/2011/04/01/earl-sweatshirt-lost-and-found-an-investigative-report-by-doc-zeus/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">elaborate satirical fan fiction</a>.</p>
<p>After a <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/complex-exclusive-we-found-earl-sweatshirt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">winding investigation</a>, <i>Complex</i> was eventually able to trace Earl to a Samoan retreat for at-risk teen boys. It seems his mother, a civil rights activist and law professor, had shipped him overseas to clear his head after behavioral problems bled into his schoolwork. Barring an <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/23/110523fa_fact_sanneh"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">expository chat</a> with <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i>, Earl fell silent after the reveal until turning up unexpectedly on Twitter one night in early 2012 with a new song called “Home” that closed with Sweatshirt giddily announcing his return: “I’m baaaack. Bye.” He appeared on various ephemera afterward: a supremely anesthetized spot on “Super Rich Kids” off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a>’s Grammy Award winning <i>Channel Orange</i>, an unannounced freestyle on the posse cut “Oldie” from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16421-the-of-tape-vol-2/"" target=""_blank"">The </a></i><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16421-the-of-tape-vol-2/"" target=""_blank"">OF Tape Vol. 2</a> </i>compilation, and tracks with OF compatriot <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">Domo Genesis</a> and Flying Lotus’ rap alter ego Captain Murphy. He seemed to pick right up where the maleficent <i>EARL </i>left off, the new verses touting the same deadpanned orgies of bloodletting and misanthropy.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the end of 2012 release of the single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14526-chum/"" target=""_blank"">“Chum”</a> that Earl addressed his story in song. Built around a simple, affecting piano figure and clattering boom bap low end, “Chum” was a travelogue of a lost soul seemingly back on track. In it Earl opens up about a life of struggles, from the absence of his father, one-time South African Poet Laureate Keorapetse Kgositsile, after a split from his mother (“I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest/ When honestly I miss this nigga like when I was six”), to discovering drugs and petty crime, finding a big brother in Tyler, and the fallout from the <i>Complex</i> expose. “Chum” was the most personal and direct he’d ever been on record; it was gobstopping without relying on the trick of sullying the youthful zest of his voice with grim stories of death and defilement.</p>
<p>Loosed from the nauseating gutbucket grit of <i>EARL</i>, Sweatshirt uses his Columbia Records debut <i>Doris </i>to convey a more varied palette of emotions. He challenges the uplifting mood of “Burgundy”’s jazzy Neptunes production, addressing the illness of his grandmother, insecurities about the new material, and lingering issues with his father in one fell swoop (“My priorities fucked up, I know it, I’m afraid I’m going to blow it/ When them expectations raising cause daddy was a poet”). He’s a distant lover on “Sunday”, trading verses with Frank Ocean about trying to tend to withering relationships as studio rats and touring musicians. “Hive” captures the sobering realities of L.A.’s inner city as Earl, his voice just above a whisper, speaks of hopeless commuters biking to jobs that don’t pay their bills (“From a city that’s recession hit/ Where stressed niggas could flex metal with pedals to rake pennies in”). The resignation in his voice in these moments of reflection is every bit as communicative as his unflappable stream of internal rhymes and arresting visual images.  </p>
<p>Even in the face of the newfound depth in Earl’s songwriting,<i> Doris</i>’ primary concern is his wordplay, which presents itself in thickets of rhymes so dense they can register as inscrutable on first listen. “Hive”’s second verse opens with: “Desolate testaments trying to stay Jekyll-ish/ But most niggas Hyde, and Brenda just stays preg-a-nant,” a glob of offbeat references, double entendres, made up words, and brilliantly disguised slant rhymes that hit as great exercises in rhyming words well before the deeper meanings can be teased out. <i>Doris </i>is also relatively hookless; where heaping doses of melody helped Tyler, the Creator break form earlier this year with <i>Wolf</i>, here it’s just raps on raps on raps. Guests are frequent, but they either come out rhyming for dear life, as Odd Future affiliate Vince Staples does when he swipes “Hive” out from under Earl in the third verse. Or they play hype man like Wu-Tang Clan’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a> on “Molasses” and Vince in the spirited pep talks between Earl’s verses on “Burgundy”. The focus never strays from Earl’s fractious, DOOM-influenced songwriting for long, and <i>Doris </i>prefers to dispense it in short, impactful bursts as the “half short and twice strong” <i>EARL </i>did in 2010.</p>
<p>The album breezes by in 44 minutes, but it feels longer. Earl favors droning, lumbering productions full of intriguing sound textures, but he pulls in enough curveballs to give the album a jerky energy. In the first few minutes alone, we get the airy keys and trap drums of opener “Pre”, brash horns and live drums on “Burgundy”, and piddling video game synths battling chunky bass on “20 Wave Caps”. Between the campy drum shuffle newly added to the end of the otherwise austere “Chum” and the shrill violin trills that usher in a shock beat change in the middle of “Centurion”, <i>Doris </i>gets as much of its jollies from settling into dark, forbidding soundscapes as it does from unexpectedly ripping us up out of them. Without the noirish serial killer stories of earlier work to fall back on, Earl has discovered new ways to shock and disorient the listener.</p>
<p><i>Doris</i> is full on its author’s prodigious abilities as a formidable young voice in L.A.’s resurgent hip-hop scene, but it’s not as concerned with the wider significance of the moment as it is with disbelief it’s actually happening. As comebacks go, it’s shockingly insular and unassuming. Earl remains self-deprecating throughout; he produces a number of the album’s tracks under the telling moniker Randomblackdude. Even when he skirts the mainstream, he does so with cautious optimism. Earl <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51850-watch-earl-sweatshirt-perform-burgundy-with-the-roots-on-fallon/"" target=""_blank"">made a television appearance with the Roots</a> on ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon""<i> </i>this month, running through the boisterous “Burgundy” with eyes closed<i> </i>after a tense walk from the blue room to the stage. It was a peculiar event, the anticlimactic unveiling of a star who’d been the talk of rap circles for three years but scarcely able to relish the attention. With <i>Doris</i>, Odd Future’s Odysseus is finally back and chasing the ghosts out of his head.</p></div>"|18380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18380-earl-sweatshirt-doris/|8.3|Craig Jenkins

You could also sense that he was a veteran songwriter and you’d be correct. While many of his peers were young men trying to cultivate mystery through anonymity, Remiddi was in his mid-30s and became more interesting with every revelation about his actual life experiences. A number of short-lived and far-flung musical projects took him around the globe and the Italian-born, London-based Remiddi created songs that were equally implaceable: they had shades of Swedish indie, UK bedsit and American lap-pop, and blurred the distinction between a guitar-toting singer/songwriter and a synth-pop artist. The inability to define Porcelain Raft contributed to the initial intrigue, but with his second LP in two years, Remiddi has cemented his sound; <i>Permanent Signal </i>is more or less more of the same, a mutual fatigue passed on from Porcelain Raft to the listener.</p>
<p>As Josh Love noted in our review of Porcelain Raft's 2012 debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16208-strange-weekend/"">Strange Weekend</a>,</i> Remiddi had a vocal connection-- if not a spiritual one-- with glam-rock space cadets of the past without overtly getting into interstellar role playing. Maybe we can chalk it up to the obligations that come with making a debut album and having to tour the thing, but <i>Permanent Signal </i>is more earthbound, Remiddi coming back down to terra firma but still communicating like a man slightly out of orbit. Members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27745-the-antlers"">the Antlers</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck"">Yuck</a> contribute in ways that you can’t immediately spot without the credits, but you sense their presence in <i>Permanent Signal</i>’s overall demeanor, a sort of mundane, window-staring melancholy, even if highlight ""The Way Out"" was inspired by the incapacitating effect of Hurricane Sandy in his new home of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Remiddi's abstract lyrics are shot through with a longing that never devolves into outright despair-- “If I think about it/ Just don’t get me started,” is the first line on the record and indicative of how candid, direct conversation is something that’s just out of reach. It makes <i>Permanent Signal </i>effective mood music, in that it <i>sounds </i>heartbroken or at least wistfully romantic, and Remiddi's own feelings never trample upon yours. </p>
<p>Consider opener “Think of the Ocean” as guidance for a means of surveying the record: it’s blue, moves in regular, steady tides and difficult to portion out into distinct territories. Hooks slowly reveal themselves, but are almost always instrumental and often referential.  “Cluster” employs a classic Cure trick, using descending guitar lines to make a major key melody draw tears like a minor one. Likewise, “I Lost Connection” is the musical and lyrical centerpiece of <i>Permanent Signal, </i>conveying its emotion not so much through his words but rather the slow rollout of major 7<sup>th</sup> piano chords, beautifully bright, wispy and touched with a dissonance that makes them <i>sound</i> sad anyway.</p>
<p>In one of the fleeting moments of pleasure, Remiddi breathes “This feeling is taking over/ The sky is made of blue,"" evocative, sweet nothings underscored by deep piano chords suggesting a house anthem about to break out. Instead, a steady kick drum pulses and eventually fades, a climax denied-- the name of the song, naturally enough, is “Minor Pleasure"". Conversely, “The Way Out” and “It Ain’t Over” interrupt the liminal, waking dream spell with distorted, rumbling breakbeats. They aren’t distractions, but all the same, what are you supposed to make of an album operating under the auspices of pop that needs drum machines to provide the hooks?</p>
<p>At the very least, <i>Permanent Signal </i>proves Remiddi is still distinguishing himself from the long-forgotten also-rans that clogged many an MP3 blog three years back. Whereas most of them couldn’t transition from singles to albums at all, let alone cohesive ones, Porcelain Raft has become <i>too </i>adept at making cohesive, whole statements. Even if <i>Strange Weekend </i>achieved a similarly unified sound, if obvious singles didn’t stand out, key phrases did. And they've taken on a prophetic resonance, ""Put Me to Sleep"" being the least of them. Previously, Remiddi doubted the worth of conversation “Unless You Speak From Your Heart,""whereas “Think of the Ocean” finds him apologetically asking “If I could take off this mask/ Will you laugh at me?,” a concise epigram for a record whose consistency feels tentative rather than confident. Or, you could think of “Shapeless &amp; Gone”, descriptive of the beatific state of Porcelain Raft’s earliest work and at the same time, an unintentional criticism of <i>Permanent Signal</i>’s lack of definition and presence. </p></div>"|18381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18381-porcelain-raft-permanent-signal/|5.8|Ian Cohen

Walking into a low-ceilinged club in Austin at this year's South by Southwest, I was assaulted by the sight of six twenty-something guys, all shirtless, seemingly none of them over 5""4, essentially scaling the walls. There were guitars played behind backs, over heads, with teeth. I'm pretty sure three guitar solos were happening at once. The people in the audience looked happier than anyone I'd ever seen. It was only when I tapped someone on the shoulder to find out what this band, this <i>epochal experience</i>, called itself, that I learned the awful truth. It didn't help that the exhilarating song they were blasting out, the fan-favorite encore, was called ""Ghost With a Boner"".</p>
<p>My experience is a luxury you have been denied, which is unfair and I am sorry. You are, naturally, wisely skeptical-- <a href=""http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashvillecream/archives/2013/06/25/photo-of-the-week-limp-bizkit-gets-diarrhea-planet"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this picture</a> probably doesn't help. But ""skepticism"" and ""Diarrhea Planet"" cannot meaningfully coexist. They are matter and antimatter, Superman and Kryptonite. Their new album, <i>I'm Rich Beyond Your Wildest Dreams</i>, is fun and ingratiating, and you can hear some of their joyfully fist-pumping spirit coursing through it. But by itself, it doesn't make the case for why you should take a band with this name to your bosom. Aggressive ridiculousness is a wonderful tool for inducing joy, but it's tricky and risky getting the dosage correct, and the main problem with a Diarrhea Planet full-length, amazingly, is that it's somehow not quite ridiculous <i>enough</i>.</p>
<p>There are some really good moments, here, to be sure. Diarrhea Planet are a pop punk band, essentially, one that has iron-enriched its sound with the good-times hedonism of hair metal and Tenacious D-style guitar heroics. Their songs sound as much like teen-movie ideas about rock-and-roll bands-- the Wyld Stallyns, the Lone Rangers-- as they do the work real-world rock bands. </p>
<p>Tellingly, many of the songs on <i>I'm Rich Beyond Your Wildest Dreams</i> could pass for KISS: ""Lite Dream"", in particular, sounds like an Ace Frehley vocal take. There are furtively odd moments in the songs that remind you they are being made in 2013, not 1977, like ""Lite Dream""'s shivery little outbreak of Sonic Youth guitars in the bridge, or the almost-Strokes high notes in the intro to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15495-diarrhea-planet-separations/"" target=""_blank"">""Separations""</a>. But they are usually shoulder-checked into a locker, moments later, by a battalion of wind-milled power chords.</p>
<p>This is an album you yell along to, preferably into the face of someone else who is yelling back. Listening to it on headphones at a cubicle desk is like playing <i>It's Dark and Hell Is Hot</i> while doing your taxes: It may work, it may not, but it was certainly not designed for those listening conditions. The most satisfying songs on <i>I'm Rich</i> are the ones that adapt a bit to the fact that all six members, logistically speaking, cannot be present to scream every note in your face as you listen. The wistful tinge in ""Kids"", for instance, makes the song stand out.</p>
<p>Some of the lyrics hint at love and longing, sort of: ""White Girls"" sketches out a break-up happening amid a ""drunken chorus of bros."" But the back-to-back songs ""Skeleton Head"" and ""Baby Head"" are little more indicative. Some of it grows a little same-y. But seriously, and I simply cannot stress this enough: if Diarrhea Planet are playing in a 100-mile radius of where you are sitting, <i>go there</i>. (And for God's sake, make sure you stay for ""Ghost With A Boner."") The next day, this album will be here to remind you, however faintly, of the experience.</p></div>"|18410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18410-diarrhea-planet-im-rich-beyond-your-wildest-dreams/|6.9|Jayson Greene

Every aspect of the project's output has always been unwelcoming and inaccessible. Some may call it unlistenable, while others will swear the music represents the pinnacle of black metal art. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all, but no matter which way you slice it, there's nothing pretty about Ildjarn. That said, starting with Ildjarn’s best-known albums from 1995 and 1996, Season of Mist has taken it upon themselves to rerelease the project's back catalog (including the short-lived Sort Voktor side project). These will be available on CD and limited edition vinyl with new artwork, which will likely delight some longtime fans, disgust the purists, and thoroughly bewilder newcomers.</p>
<p>To consider oneself an Ildjarn fan requires a certain suspension of belief, or at least, of any expectation that it will sound like anything but what it is. The polarizing effect of Vidar Vaaer's project, which started in 1991 and continued until the 2005 <i>Ildjarn Is Dead</i> compilation, stems from an unwillingness to compromise on anything, from recording quality (zero) to vocal style (singular). Unbearable or irresistible are the only two options, and the former camp is far more populous than the latter. Whether one is reacquainting oneself with these three albums or encountering them for the first time, it’s important to bear in mind that Ildjarn’s heyday was in the early 90s. The recordings come off as brutally minimalist and lo-fi when considered within a modern context, but are honestly fairly par for the course when compared with what many of his peers were doing when Vaaer first began.</p>
<p>Vaaer was an early member of Norway’s Second Wave black metal scene, appearing on a 1991 demo from the pre-Emperor project Thou Shalt Suffer and acting as a live bassist for Emperor themselves in 1993 before splitting off to continue expanding upon his own vision with Ildjarn. Trivia nerds will remember how his former bandmates repaid the favor, with both Ihsahn and Samoth contributing guest vocals on several of Ildjarn’s releases. Though Vaaer definitely takes things to an exceptionally primitive level, the sonic quality does not deviate much from that found on similar recordings from the same time period. Listen to any Beherit demo, or even Mayhem’s <i>Deathcrush</i>.</p>
<p>Unlike his peers that eventually evolved and became more acquainted with a soundboard, though, Vaaer remained loyal to his long-suffering 4-track tape recorder. Ildjarn embraces the singlemindedness of raw punk, bashing away at three chords or less and keeping song lengths taut for maximum impact. He aims for brute force. Most of his songs flirt with the three-minute mark, and come and go in quick, ugly spasms. The result reeks of misanthropic hate.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see how the likes of Willing Feet, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23432-bone-awl/"" target=""_blank"">Bone Awl</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30558-raspberry-bulbs/"" target=""_blank"">Raspberry Bulbs</a> could owe a hefty debt of gratitude to albums like 1995’s <i>Ildjarn</i>. Nearly every song is populated by simplistic distorted power chords and strong bass lines that bleed together into one steady monotonous drone, broken up by occasional ambient passages a la Burzum's <i>Filosofem</i> that make more sense when his latter-day synthesizer fixation is taken into account. The uniformly coarse vocals are almost always buried low in the mix. As for the percussion, even the most casual of music listeners would have a hard time believing that human hands are holding down those beats. Vaaer works his rickety kit into a lather of constant, unapologetically simple 4/4 beats that serve as both metronome and, often, inadvertent focal point and an absurd number of drum count-ins serve to further disorient. The majority of its 27 songs follow the same rough format, but Vaaer does throw his listener the odd bone on dense, hypnotic tracks like the slow, punishing “Krigere” or uncharacteristically well-developed melody on “Blikkets Storhet”. Here, he proves that he can write compelling, nuanced material. He just doesn’t particularly care to.</p>
<p><i>Strength and Anger</i> was released barely a year later, swiftly followed by <i>Landscapes</i>, the <i>Svartfråd</i> EP, and then <i>Forest Poetry</i>. <i>Strength and Anger</i> is short by Ildjarn’s standards, with only 18 tracks crammed into its 70-odd minutes. The song largely remains the same, but there are a few hints of progress. Vaaer continues to browbeat his listeners with barbaric lo-fi black metal, but tracks like “VI” and “XV” show melodic development, and the 14-minute dark ambient piece “Black Anger (Hate Meditation 1)” is a total 180. Its harsh noise proclivities carry over onto “Interchange”, and devolve once more into a long, unsettling ambient outro “Midnight Strength, Black Anger (Hate Meditation 2)”.</p>
<p><i>Forest Poetry</i> was released only a few months after <i>Strength and Anger</i>, and it shows. Comparatively speaking, and in regards to his straight-up black metal period, this 22-song beast is probably Ildjarn’s most accessible album, though typing the word “accessible” in any sort of Ildjarn discussion is farce. Thanks to a minute increase in sound quality and the strangely catchy “Visions of the Earth (2nd Returning)”, the dominant bassline in “Deepening in Grey”, and fuzzy dirge of closing track “No Place Nowhere” it’s more consistent and slightly more listenable than its predecessor. Even for a humorless Scandinavian, the whimsical title is so tongue-in-cheek it hurts.</p>
<p>Ultimately, on these records, Ildjarn achieved what Norwegian black metal ostensibly set out to accomplish in the first place, by creating the most resolutely unlistenable, anti-human, supremely hateful and altogether foul creation possible. Whether you want to listen to it or not is another matter entirely.</p></div>"|18366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18366-ildjarn-strength-and-anger-forest-poetry-ildjarn/|5.5|Kim Kelly

So far in 2013, three of that instrument’s masters-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17780-william-tyler-impossible-truth/"">William Tyler</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18007-glenn-jones-my-garden-state/"">Glenn Jones</a>, and <a href=""http://threelobed.com/tlr/tlr099.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chuck Johnson</a>-- have made possibly the best albums of their respective careers, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15794-first-field-path/"">Nathan Salsburg</a> and <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/release/eMEGO-173"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Orcutt</a> are poised to do the same soon. But apparently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31574-danny-paul-grody/"">Danny Paul Grody</a> isn’t afraid of competition. Having already made two solid LPs in the past three years, he decided to get more ambitious and expansive on his latest, <i>Between Two Worlds</i>. And guess what? It might be the best album of his career.</p>
<p>It also manages to carve out a sonic niche in an arena full of them. Grody’s approach stands out for a lot of reasons, but two in particular fascinate. First, his songs are more about repetition than melody, more about hypnosis than hook. There are memorable note patterns all over <i>Between Two Worlds</i>, but a deeper impression is left by the way Grody turns them into mantras. His playing stretches time, making even his busiest passages patient and meditative. There’s a reason he called one of the best tracks here “Time Spirals”.</p>
<p>In addition, <i>Between Two Worlds </i>is a singular acoustic guitar album simply because it’s more than an acoustic guitar album. It starts off as one, with three songs focused on Grody’s ringing string work. But as the album winds forward, he subtly adds other elements-- piano chords, synth drones, tape manipulation, wordless vocals-- to accent and surround his guitar. This evolution from simple strands to denser fields happens naturally, bolstered by Grody’s experience crafting larger environments with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4175-tarentel/"">Tarentel</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29985-the-drift/"">the Drift</a>. So by the time closer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15803-ojito-at-sunset/"">“Ojito (At Sunset)”</a> arrives, its long, space-filling tones feel like the logical extension of earlier finger-picked figures.</p>
<p>Before you get that deep into <i>Between Two Worlds, </i>though, take some time to get lost in those first three tracks. On each, Grody gradually massages a loop of notes, crafting a spectrum of shapes and colors without ever deviating far from his starting point. I’m especially intoxicated by “You, the Invisible”, which begins as a kind of one-man funeral march with slow strums and dramatic pauses. But as the pace quickens and the gaps close, Grody hits an ecstatic rush while steadfastly maintaining a sense of gravity.</p>
<p>That range of moods persists as <i>Between Two Worlds </i>shifts focus from string-plucks to held tones. Grody never really gets light-hearted; most of the time the atmosphere is pretty heavy. But it’s hard to imagine anyone getting bummed out by any part of <i>Between Two Worlds. </i>Even its most somber moments are infused with optimism-- a trust that non-verbal sound can, when played well, express pretty much any emotion imaginable.</p></div>"|18421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18421-danny-paul-grody-between-two-worlds/|7.2|Marc Masters

The vibe is <i>Moulin Rouge</i> meets <i>Cheers</i>: a frenetic, turn-of-the-century Parisian haunt where, for better or worse, everybody knows your name. When each couple enters Maxim’s-- yes, <i>couple</i>; somehow you get the sense that it would be social suicide for a respectable lady of the time to step foot in the place unaccompanied-- a crowd of patrons begins to chant in a hushed, gossipy tone. As they whisper the kinds of things that people rarely say aloud (even when they’re thinking them), and the scene draws a bleak, ironic contrast between people’s private thoughts and the outward demands of polite society. “Isn’t she a mess? Isn’t she a sight?” they say as one pair enters. “Let’s invite them out tomorrow night!”</p>
<p>“There’s something kind of creepy about that scene that I wanted to bring out,” L.A. avant-pop musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a> said in a recent <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1407612/julia-holter-on-her-new-album-being-inspired-by-gigi-and-going-on-tour-with-a-giant-keyboard/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, talking about “Maxim’s I &amp; II”, a gorgeous (if slightly sinister) pair of songs that appear on her mesmerizing third album, <i>Loud City Song</i>. Holter’s said that the album is her own loose interpretation of <i>Gigi</i>-- both the musical and the original 1944 novella by the French writer Colette (the plot, in the expert, proto-Twitter brevity of a <a href=""http://www.tcm.com/search/?text=gigi&amp;type=allDb"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Turner Classic Movie blurb</a>: “A Parisian girl is raised to be a kept woman but dreams of love and marriage.”).</p>
<p>Plenty of other songwriters might fumble or stiffen when drawing on source material from decades before they were born, but not Holter. Maybe it’s because making a record based on a 1950s MGM musical is actually her idea of keeping things new-school: <i>Tragedy</i>, her 2011 debut, was an ambitious yet intimate meditation on ancient Greek playwright Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i>, while her dreamily crystalline follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16352-ekstasis/""><i>Ekstasis</i> </a>(also a nod to ancient Greece) sounded like bedroom pop made by somebody with pin-ups of Heidegger and Virginia Woolf (and also maybe Laurie Anderson) papering the walls. Holter’s music is learned (she studied musical composition at CalArts) and proudly erudite, and yet not in a way that feels like it’s talking down to the listener. Still, she’s never made a record quite as inviting as <i>Loud City Song</i>-- her first album for Domino and the one most likely to turn skeptics to believers. From the panoramic ballroom swoon of “Maxim’s I” to the twinkling, kinetic chatter of its sequel, there’s an energy coursing through <i>Loud City Song</i> that makes it feel-- more than anything she’d done so far-- breezy, contemporarily resonant, and at all times flutteringly alive.</p>
<p><i>Loud</i><i> City Song</i> is the first album that Holter recorded outside of her bedroom, and-- like a 19th century French literary heroine seeking the therapeutic air of a seaside vacation-- the change in scenery seems to have loosened her up a bit. If <i>Ekstasis</i> had the serene intimacy of home recordings made with the apartment curtains drawn, <i>Loud City Song</i> finds her flinging open the drapes and taking rhythmic cues from the bustle of people below. Much of this newfound dynamism comes from adding new collaborators (and returning to trusted old ones: like <i>Ekstasis</i>, the record was mixed and co-produced by Ariel Pink collaborator Cole Mardsen Greif-Neill) and embracing a more jazz-oriented instrumentation-- trombones, strings, and a double bass all add a little drama, agility, and even playfulness to her sound.</p>
<p>Holter name-checks old Parisian landmarks like Maxim’s and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9147-julia-holter/"">says</a> she was also inspired by the disconnectedness and buzzing anonymity of her hometown (""In L.A., it's like everyone's invisible. That's why I like it here.""). But what gives these songs an emotional resonance beyond the confines of her own imagination is the way they capture something universal about the joys and anxieties of living in any modern city. As Holter's nimble voice skips between her siren-song falsetto and a more percussive delivery closer to spoken word, the mood of the album is in constant flux: in the menacing “Horns Surrounding Me” the brisk footfall of her fellow passersby evokes claustrophobia, danger and paranoia (is she being chased? Or is it all in her head?), but by the next song, the playful pop-cabaret “In the Green Wild”, she’s looking at her fellow pavement-pounders with a sense of bemused wonder.</p>
<p>Still, it’s the album’s centerpiece, a hypnotizing six-and-a-half minute rendition of Barbara Lewis' “Hello Stranger”, that might just be the most uncomplicatedly gorgeous thing Holter’s ever done. It’s risky to tackle a tune that’s been covered enough times to make it feel like a modern-day standard, but Holter’s atmospheric take finds a particular strain of longing and serenity in the song. It's a heart-stopper. Amidst the rest of <i>Loud City Song</i>’s chatty, high-concept vitality, “Hello Stranger” is a moment of comfort and instant connection, like suddenly spotting a familiar face on a busy street.</p>
<p>Though there’s definitely a narrative arc to the record, it doesn’t stick so close to the <i>Gigi</i> script to become tedious; <i>Loud City Song </i>moves with an internal logic that’s more impressionistic than literal. Some of its pieces do stand sturdily on their own, but taken in one sitting the album unfurls like one long, thoughtfully arranged composition-- lyrics and images recur, and characters gradually evolve. The narrator at the center (Gigi? Holter? Some kind of poetic hybrid of the two?) begins as a detached, observant outsider-- just another anonymous face gazing curiously at the city below from the perch of her fifth-floor walk-up (""I don't how why I wear a hat so much,"" Holter sings beneath the sparse groan of a cello on the opening song, ""World"", ""The city can't see my eyes under the brim."") But by the end-- the second-to-last track, “This Is a True Heart” prances like a lazy-Sunday carousel ride-- she sounds not only more vulnerable but lighter, too. In a way, the arc of <i>Loud City Song</i> mirrors Holter’s artistic evolution: <i>Ekstasis </i>found kindred spirits in statues and goddesses (“I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry,” she repeated on “Goddess Eyes II”, cloaked in a vocoder), but the psychologically complex narrator at the heart of <i>Loud City Song </i>moves like flesh and blood.</p>
<p>“There’s a flavor to the sound of walking no one ever noticed before,"" Holter chants in a rapt whisper throughout ""In the Green Wild"". It's a telling line: <i>Loud City Song</i> is one of those records so full of un-jaded wonder and attuned to the secret music of ordinary things that the world looks a little bit different while it's playing. I don't think I fully appreciated it until I listened to the whole thing while looking out a second-story window onto a crowded street during rush hour, watching an endless procession of people with eyes hidden to the city under the brims of hats (or, to update Holter's image, staring down at their iPhones). To the tune of ""World"", I started wondering who they all were, where they were rushing, and what they were thinking. Though it draws upon the distant past, Julia Holter's made a timeless people-watching soundtrack: an acutely felt ode to the mysteries of a million passersby, all the stars of their own silent musicals.</p></div>"|18378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18378-julia-holter-loud-city-song/|8.6|Lindsay Zoladz

But they weren’t defined by indulgence so much as a Hulk-like instability. ""Lammicken"" had a single, telling lyric-- ""I can't stop it."" When Raphaelle Standell-Preston’s soft-spoken surrealism exploded into carnal caterwauling and the band’s intricate interplay gave way to washes of free-form noise, you sensed that Braids had to work their asses off just to keep themselves in check, and were doing it for our good and theirs as well. Braids appear to have their impulses under control two years later, and if <i>Native Speaker </i>drew its power from being the proverbial tip of the iceberg, <i>Flourish // Perish </i>is the iceberg itself, impressive and monolithic, cold and impenetrable.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s not all that surprising, as Montreal has seen a chill come over it since entering 2013 as indie's hottest city-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz"">Majical Cloudz</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18042-majical-cloudz-impersonator/"">Impersonator </a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18042-majical-cloudz-impersonator/""></a>achieved a glacial, barren beauty, something like sunlight on the Antarctic, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1126-doldrums"">Doldrums</a> disappeared into his laptop with static-laden, cracked pop. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes"">Grimes</a> did somewhat likewise, retreating from music and relating her experiences with incisive and invective Tumblr posts. Then there’s Preston, the first in the scene to receive widespread attention; the humid romance of 2010’s <i>Blooming Summer </i>was a distant memory for her side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17980-blue-hawaii"">Blue Hawaii</a>, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17549-blue-hawaii-untogether/""><i>Untogether</i></a> was filled with disaffected, click-and-whir electro laments that could be taken as a commentary on an artistic community that’s grown apart from each other.</p>
<p>On first exposure, it can feel like <i>Flourish // Perish </i>is an extension of <i>Untogether </i>rather than a complement. Pared down to a trio after losing founding member Kate Lee, Braids all but ditched their guitars and got deep into programming and sequencers. As such, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/"">Feels</a></i> has been exchanged for mind music-- the mechanistic <i>Flourish </i>is heavy on turn of the century Warp (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin"">Aphex Twin</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher"">Squarepusher</a>) and Warp-influenced crossover acts, i.e., <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/""><span>Björk</span> </a>ca. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork""><i>Vespertine </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead"">Radiohead</a>. Hermetic and kinetic, the band’s production bears the mark of “intelligent dance music”, not because it’s <i>smarter </i>than other electronic forms (as if that could be quantified) but due to its mirroring of cerebral function. The songs here are built from short, synaptic and repetitive firing, tiny loops, short glitches, silvery hooks that corkscrew into your memory. </p>
<p>It’s an interesting and daring turn for Braids, retaining the complicated, prog-like arrangements of their past while working within the textures of IDM and minimal techno. The spaciousness and clarity of <i>Flourish </i>does make it an easy record to return to; while challenging, it’s not a difficult listen. This is crucial, as the underlying rhythm beds rarely give Braids much melodic structure and put the focus on Preston’s lyrics, which are simultaneously more poetic and yet less evocative than her past work.</p>
<p>On <i>Native Speaker, </i>Preston functioned like an anthropologist in the wild, experiencing the strange rhythms and rituals of those around her, journaling the frightening results without judgment. There’s a scientific method to <i>Flourish, </i>where she’s inquisitive, probing and more concerned with challenging her own findings within clinical surroundings.  Examples of self-examination and self-recrimination abound on <i>Flourish-- </i>Preston’s ego is a bed too comfortable to leave, her head a lake in which to drown. Yet, she maintains critical distance and for that reason, Braids are a lot tougher to read here. On the whispery morning-after ballad “Girl”, a lover serves as a mirror for the narrator’s inadequacies rather than comfort: “Every day I wake/ To sunlight on his face/ He is so care free/ Why can I not be.”  On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15798-hossak/"">“Hossak”</a>, Preston acknowledges “a boy knocking outside my window with a slice of pizza” with the eerie absenteeism of someone describing a UFO sighting.</p>
<p>The extraterrestrial quality cuts both ways. <i>Flourish </i>is a purposefully alien and repetitive album, and at the outset, it works-- the fractious, percussive rhythms of ""Victoria"" and ""December'' are hypnotic, as is the overlay of high, diaphonous cooing atop Preston's spoken word during ""Freund"". But in the second half, the iterance becomes tedious; footholds are few amidst the long stretches of vast electronic tundra and the <i>Perish </i>side B can feel like a sheer drop towards revelatory closer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15543-in-kind/"" target=""_blank"">“In Kind""</a>. </p>
<p>In a way, it makes you want to try and listen to <i>Flourish // Perish </i>in reverse-- “In Kind” feels like a continuation of <i>Native Speaker, </i>with the same kind of cresting dynamics and the one time where Preston lets off a scream, a satisfying, feral shriek that almost compensates for its lack thereof prior. And there’s also its introductory lyric, “I must have saw a girl/ Who looked a lot like myself ... knowing all the answers/ And it is a problem.” And if that’s the problem of this intriguing but insular album, the solution is found on “Victoria”-- “My father always said/ To get out of my head/ Maybe he meant to see what's next to me.” That’s the first line on <i>Flourish // Perish, </i>and the one that Braids could be wise to heed going forward.</p></div>"|18326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18326-braids-flourishperish/|7.1|Ian Cohen

But Bitchin Bajas, which began as the project of Chicago's Cooper Crain, has grown into a trio that specializes in the kind of calmly interstellar music that feels unconnected to time, space, or trends. <i>Bitchitronics</i>, their fourth proper album, is a serene cloud of hovering tones and near-zero motion, an album of sounds that feel so good that they feel like events in themselves.  The title sure sounds like a sly nod to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6049-robert-fripp/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Fripp</a>'s Frippertronics, and the dazed spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno </a>and Fripp hovers like a mild uncle, but <i>Bitchitronics</i> doesn't feel overly concerned with any other music. It doesn't seem overly concerned at all. If you have absolutely nowhere to go in the near future, <i>Bitchitronics</i> will make an excellent travel companion.</p>
<p><i>Bitchitronics</i> is made of three tape machines talking to each other: Two machines generate loops, the third records them. The loops start out as musical information, but quickly melt into shapes, and the Bajas surround those shapes with other, live instruments-- fluttering jazz flute, noodly guitar soloing. Sometimes the loop sputters quietly, like someone clearing their throat in church. Heavily reverbed guitars leave little condensed little raindrops of notes on their surfaces. A little bass enters; the bass recedes. At one point, an electric guitar arcs beautifully upward, but it's gone and forgotten shortly after it appears.</p>
<p>This doesn't sound like everyone's idea of a good time. I can sympathize; structure-free music meant to soothe usually leaves my nerve-endings seething, grasping for stimulus like the tubers shooting out of a dying potato. But the four pieces on <i>Bitchitronics</i> are so beautiful that their patient steadiness doesn't bore or irritate me. Making an album that makes doing this little sound so charming and inviting is no minor accomplishment. I can spend time with <i>Bitchitronics</i>' four pieces, let them decide how they're going to arrange themselves this time through. Each time, they settle a little bit differently.</p>
<p>""Reviewing"" <i>Bitchitronics</i> is difficult, because isolating moments in an album like this feels like pointing out a particular section of a cloud. All four pieces seep slowly into view the same way-- a slow corona in a major key, one warm chord steadily accreting in size. The pieces swell into view, but once they're present, they don't build much further upon themselves; drone music often pairs nicely with grandeur, but the tones on <i>Bitchitronics</i> are often quavery and weak-sounding. This isn't visceral, or elemental music-- unlike, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"" target=""_blank"">Oneida</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"" target=""_blank"">Boredoms</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5356-grails/"" target=""_blank"">Grails</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3222-om/"" target=""_blank"">Om</a>, you can't imagine taking Bitchin Bajas to the desert. If you're going to use it to meditate, meditate indoors, preferably in a room with old carpeting and low shutters; if you take it outside, it might sound pale and timid. There are no revelations, no crashing waves. Their ""om"" is the 2 a.m. hum of a refrigerator.</p></div>"|18425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18425-bitchin-bajas-bitichitronics/|7.6|Jayson Greene

Released on the <a href=""http://thisispeakoil.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peak Oil</a> label, the package includes only a handful of track titles and a note hinting it was recorded between 2010-12. Those titles are ultimately meaningless; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30034-slow-walkers/"">Slow Walkers</a>' music runs together with barely any separation, feeling more like a continuous journey than a series of separate narratives. It's instrumental, drone-based work, leaning heavily on repetition and the kind of eerie ambience for which Harris is known. Had this record been released earlier in her career then questions may have been raised about how she and English could reach such a troubled, lonely, barren place. But by now it's clear that this is the spot where Harris operates most effectively.</p>
<p>Part of Grouper's power is in the way the music feels like it's made in a vacuum, shorn of contemporary reference points or settings. Slow Walkers aren't exactly out there tweeting up a storm, but this record has been alluded to as ""meditations for the zombie as cultural phenomena"" in the <a href=""http://vimeo.com/30846604"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">description</a> below a video for the track ""Wake"". What that means or how it applies here is suitably foggy, and the fact that the clip was uploaded to the Room40 Vimeo account over a year ago suggests it may no longer be appropriate. If Slow Walkers are thinking about death as a process, then they're imagining it as a long, drawn out, painful undertaking. There's a strong sense of journey here, similar to the depth felt in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"">the Haxan Cloak</a>'s excellent afterlife meditation, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17732-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2-excavation/""><i>Excavation</i></a>. Except with Slow Walkers everything is much less chiseled, with Harris and English foregoing definition for suggestion, choosing to imagine feelings instead of laying out a tangible roadmap.</p>
<p>At times this feels of a piece with the rolling tundras of Harris' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16493-violet-replacement/""><i>Violet Replacement</i></a> work, which similarly juxtaposed anxiety with something far more relaxing. What Slow Walkers do is similar, setting up an unsettling atmosphere and then letting beautiful drones arc and dissolve across its gloomy surface. This project has been <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44449-watch-grouper-lawrence-english-pay-tribute-to-zombies-with-slow-walkers/"">talked up</a> as a multi-media undertaking, with video installations and audio-visual concert performances, but it's hard to picture how that would work when the music itself is so visually suggestive. The second side opens with a positively holy feel, its wispy ambience bringing to mind an abandoned, wind-whipped cathedral. It's impressive how Harris and English can work in tandem to build tension and then just let it float away, turning trepidation into bliss. By the close of the second side, deep into ""Wake"", there's a lightness present, a sense of calm settling in, a feeling that this isn't such a bad place to be after all.</p>
<p>Slow Walkers may be hiding from the world to a certain extent-- the nature of this album helps frame it as a tentative step instead of a full-blown leap. It's not clear if that will develop further, although there's enough here to suggest potential not yet fully realized. This isn't on a par with Grouper's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17571-the-man-who-died-in-his-boat-dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill/""><i>The Man Who Died In His Boat</i></a> from earlier this year, but Slow Walkers is definitely a secret that's a little too good to be kept in the province of a select band of Harris devotees. Appropriately, it begins with a crackle of radio static, lending it a lost-transmission feel that only a few people are privy to hearing, either alive or, perhaps, undead. If this is a record about death, then it's primarily about the process of letting go, of watching someone transform from present to past tense, fading from the physical world to become a bundle of memories for people to carry around.</p></div>"|18391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18391-slow-walkers-slow-walkers/|6.8|Nick Neyland

Back then he went by Craig Gordon (an inside joke amongst friends), an ex-hip-hop wannabe who decided to explore more mysterious atmospheres with bandmates David Bolt and Karrie K. Now Acosta's back, using his own name to record what he considers a more personal album with <i>Better Unsung</i>, a lengthy, overly-ambitious piece of work that finds him in the role of a solo artist, despite enlisting the help of the <i>Machines</i>-era players, as well as Seattle production team <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29657-blue-sky-black-death/"" target=""_blank"">Blue Sky Black Death</a> and <a href=""http://www.anticon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anticon</a> co-founder Alias, who also co-produced the record. Clocking in at almost an hour, <i>Better Unsung</i> is divided by four suites entitled ""Probability and Outcome"", which take their name from dialogue featured in the 1978 Warren Beatty vehicle <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqt-O9F6AkQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Heaven Can Wait</i></a>. The film follows a football star who is taken from earth prematurely by his guardian angel following a car accident, only to be returned in the body of a recently murdered millionaire. <i>Better Unsung</i> is most certainly Acosta's new millionaire disguise, pushing the ideas found on the understated <i>Machines</i> to convoluted, beat-oriented, maxims.</p>
<p>It's not such a bad idea, after all. <i>Machines</i> did harness something promising in the ""electro shoe-goth"" realm (genre description courtesy of <a href=""https://twitter.com/TheDeltaMirror"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Acosta's Twitter account</a>), and blowing that up to the festival-ready size of an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails</a>, or even a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7374-school-of-seven-bells/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">School of Seven Bells</a> could prove pretty satisfying. But <i>Better Unsung</i> misses the opportunity at almost every turn, packing disorienting production, clunky lyrics, and undercooked hooks into interminably long, aimless songs that mean to either invoke chills or stimulate some kind of freeing catharsis, but instead end up bludgeoning you into an uncomfortable submission. There's no denying that Acosta has ambition, talent and-- thanks to hints of trip-hop, arena-made alt-rock, and starry-eyed shoegaze pop-- pretty good taste, but it's in the execution where he falls short. In making the leap from a somewhat insular musician to one now begging for space on a larger stage, his knack for detail and follow-through feels lost, resulting in an album too bloated to ever get its feet off the ground.</p>
<p>It's unlikely Acosta set out for self-sabotage, but at times it's hard to come up with an alternate excuse in the case of some of these songs. ""Undeveloped Unreturned"" is a nice change of pace from the preceding ""Goldfish"", which relies heavily on a set of played-out tropes (backwards vocals, fuzz-fucked drums). Despite its problematically schmaltzy chorus (""I’m the photo that you throw away/ I’m the phone call that you don’t take""), there's a noticeable melody that helps carry the song. But it's Acosta's nagging need to kick things into overdrive in order approximate some sort of big, effusive high that often sinks these songs. With its blown-out climax, ""Undeveloped Unreturned"" is sapped of its potential transportive qualities. Sadly, this is a recurring theme. ""Lead Me In""'s plaintive, glassy guitars give way to a cinderblock-smashing mechanized beat drop, in which the song again aims to become some kind of celestial, lighter-waving sing-along that, instead of inspiring, feels like anesthetized. The thing is, he can get away with this kind of thing occasionally. <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/goodbye-horses-by-the-delta-mirror-free-mp3-20130731"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Goodbye Horses""</a> is easily the best cut on the album, and despite coming off as more than a little silly, actually soars. But it's a fleeting example of <i>Better Unsung</i> getting things right, and suggests that on this level, Acosta just doesn't have the stuff to make this kind of thing gel in a coherent, exciting way.<br/><br/>In the end,<i> Better Unsung</i> feels kind of hollow in the face of its too-muchness. It begins to appear compulsive at times with Acosta throwing so many different things at the wall at once, ultimately sacrificing any sort of clarity of vision thanks to too many ideas and too many collaborators. It's unlikely that you wanted an industrial remix of ""Goldfish"", but there it is, tacked on as a hidden track at the end of an already exhaustively long record. It might be easy to suggest a little restraint is necessary here, but ballads like the yelp-y ""The Bear"" or the folk-like ""The Happiest Endings Are the Ones That Never Come"" (not true) reveal that misguided bombast is sometimes better than just plain old boring. You can't fault Acosta for pushing himself as an artist, but <i>Better Unsung</i> proves that this reinvention is merely just a disguise if the songs aren't there.</p></div>"|18406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18406-the-delta-mirror-better-unsung/|5.6|Zach Kelly

In what seems today like a past life, this was Nika Roza Danilova, the now 24-year-old Wisconsin-bred singer-songwriter who makes music as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a>-- a vision planted with the noise-flecked seeds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"" target=""_blank"">Throbbing Gristle</a> and gloomy Diamanda Galás that has since bloomed into widescreen industrial art-pop. This D.I.Y. show four years ago epitomized the fly-by-night Brooklyn indie scene at the height of late-aughts blog-rock. In the spring of 2012, Danilova was in the same city but a different world. On the Upper East Side, donning an angelic high-fashion contraption that featured the likeness of wings, she performed within the cylindrical ramps of the revered Guggenheim Museum. A conductor was present.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From this moment comes <i>Versions</i>, a new collection from Danilova's collaboration with a string quartet led by J.G. Thirlwell, a vet of experimental industrial music since the 1980s who is also known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1527-foetus/"" target=""_blank"">Foetus</a>. (His collaborations range from transgressive electronic like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3079-nurse-with-wound/"" target=""_blank"">Nurse With Wound</a> and Coil to provocateur rock legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave</a> and Lydia Lunch.) The orchestral realm is new for Danilova, but not unexpected; from the start, Zola Jesus has exhibited a devoted narrative of change. Songs like <i>Versions</i>' ""Night"" and ""Sea Talk"" were <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZTfMqPRA8U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">once ensconced</a> in surreal, grating reverb-- see <i>New Amsterdam</i>'s ""Lady Maslenitsa"" for how far the lo-fi abrasion went-- and later turned into thundering ballads, while she evolved further on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15897-conatus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Conatus</i></a> LP, embracing metallic percussion and the skittering beats of 1990s Intelligent Dance Music. ""There's a sense of anarchy to it,"" she’s said of IDM. Making industrial sounds with avant-garde influence but foremost pop sense, she could also find a kindred spirit in, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6209-trent-reznor/"" target=""_blank"">Trent Reznor</a>, and they've shared many collaborators, of them iconic film director <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"" target=""_blank"">David Lynch</a>, the producer Flood, and Thirlwell.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite the shifts, there are essential qualities that bind the Zola Jesus songbook. The enormity of her morose voice is a constant, as are ominous themes, from ""Six Feet (From My Baby)"" (a song about her own burial) to titles such as ""Lick the Palm of the Burning Handshake"". Her songs remain elegant and brutal with a life-or-death seriousness, exorcising loneliness with tension you could pop with a pin. The best of Danilova's songwriting, most of which is collected here, has grown anthemic, as she gestures towards grander reaches of ambition-- ""Ever since I wrote my first song I wanted to be playing Madison Square Garden,"" she's said. She has collaborated with the rapper El-P, covered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a>'s ""Diamonds"", and in 2011 sang on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>'s commercial breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hurry Up, We're Dreaming</i></a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's something curious about <i>Versions</i>, though. Many of the qualities that strings typically cast upon an artist's work-- austerity, grace, a cinematic sweep-- already exist in the original takes of her songs. (The songs here have all been released before, some twice, save for the exceedingly romantic new track ""Fall Back"".) <i>Conatus</i> itself used acoustic strings, but what gives its orchestral versions value is a brighter take on her expressive singing. Danilova has described her creative process as self-critical and emotionally draining; ""Why does it always have to be war for me?"" she's asked. Here, her voice is less menacingly deep and air-tight; it sounds open, sweet, and full of light. Often, it is conventionally beautiful, like she's freed herself. ""Avalanche (Slow)"", for instance, is a sublime deconstruction where Danilova's words blissfully crawl, hitting notes sharply with stronger vibrato. As the piercing high strings weep, she sounds fixed in a dream of total control, slowing her pace as a chaotic world buzzes about.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The older songs, off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13987-stridulum-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Stridulum</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14722-valusia-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Valusia</i></a>, are the best of her catalog. It's hard to imagine any take of the epic ballads ""Sea Talk"" or ""Night"" losing value; fans of previous versions, which had programmed strings, will want to hear them with real ones. But relative to the originals, the orchestral versions have a distancing effect, as if listening in on something once removed. Their emotional core is dramatic as ever, but some details, washed out here, are missed, like the ghostly buzzing that prefaces ""Night"" or the louder beats that crash ""Sea Talk"" open. <i>Versions</i> offers welcomed arrangements, but in both cases they are trumped by the visceral power of those songs' heavier incarnations.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Versions</i> benefits from the inclusion of ""Fall Back"", the new song, which seems composed with the grandiose potential of an orchestra in mind-- the pizzicato parts are celebratory, and a colossal violin crescendo adds sweeping dimension, building to an overwhelming cloud of sound that conjures the feel of a gleaming, open sky. ""This is my home/ You are my only one,"" Danilova sings in booming, crystalline lines, holding back nothing of a rapturous heart. ""I would do anything to be with you forever."" As heard here, it’s not hard to imagine these passionate admissions mixing with the sounds of clinking champagne glasses at a wedding.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The most compelling thing about <i>Versions</i> has more to do with Danilova herself than Thirlwell or the Mivos Quartet. Zola Jesus is rarely discussed in a capital-p Pop context, as if having left noise behind her work could be more truly populist. Stripped of most electronics, though, these massive hooks and their collective human core are put under a microscope, and it's impressive to see the songs carry themselves without all the dark, propulsive production. Danilova has taken these compositions about as far as they can go, and still there remains something intriguing about Zola Jesus, not just for her ghostly enigma or art world appeal but now for what really comes next.</p></div>"|18376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18376-zola-jesus-versions/|7.6|Jenn Pelly

His vertebral artery ruptured during a visit to a chiropractor’s office. He had a stroke, slipped into a coma and, at the age of 45, passed away. In the decades that have followed, his already-wavering reputation as a pioneer of finger-picked acoustic guitar experimentation has passed largely like a shadow behind the music and myth of John Fahey, Basho’s old pal who <a href=""http://www.wirz.de/music/takomfrm.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">released</a> several of his earliest albums.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that Fahey experienced a renaissance in the 90s. The music press famously championed his early work and helped goad him from semi-retirement. He followed the laurels both with a string of strange, daring records and a brilliant new record label, Revenant, which advocated alternate strains of the avant-garde and the hillbilly music that had helped inspire his own. Basho, being dead, enjoyed no such revival. In fact, <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/142205736/Guitarist-of-the-Other-Shore-Robbie-Basho-in-the-1960s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a large chunk of his catalogue</a> now languishes out of print, serving as grails for collectors rather than essential bits in a narrative much broader than Blind Joe Death. And that’s a shame: Nearly 30 years after his death, and after multiple waves of guitarists have risen to revive the mantle Fahey and Basho both helped shape, Basho’s manic, hyperkinetic approach to playing, singing, songwriting and living in general have very few peers. Basho’s tenth album, 1978’s <i>Visions of the Country</i>, was <a href=""http://windhaming.com/windham-hill-discography-100/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the fifth album Windham Hill Records ever released.</a> After more than three decades out of print, it is finally back in circulation; on its 35th anniversary, it serves as an ecstatic testimonial for a guitarist in need of a popular resurrection.   </p>
<p>Basho’s relative anonymity isn’t only a byproduct of his untimely death, of course: Even when he was alive, his allegedly <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/142205736/Guitarist-of-the-Other-Shore-Robbie-Basho-in-the-1960s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inscrutable personality and debated quirks</a> kept him a bit at arms length. Those same strange traits are part and parcel to his music. He did not aim for Fahey’s steady, solemn gaze or Leo Kottke’s eccentric approachability. Rather, Basho’s music was a blunderbuss of feeling, tied to unstoppable technique. He whistles loudly over the Keith Jarrett-sized piano clouds of “Leaf in the Wind”, as though it were his aim to spoil the song’s billowing beauty. And he ends <i>Visions of the Country </i>by urging listeners to “follow the Milky Way-- home!” in a voice that suggests Mr. Rogers.</p>
<p>Indeed, Basho’s singing generally wasn’t what you’d call pretty or subtle. During “Night Way”, from the second side of <i>Visions of the Country</i>, he obscures the wonderful ribbons of his six-string guitar with singing generously described as zealous. He wails a ceremonial Navajo chant, his voice locking into and falling from falsetto, its vibrato smearing the track with warble. For the listener, the guitar is the star here, but you have to peer past the bleat to find it. During “Orphan’s Lament”, he slurs and nearly screams his tribute to the poor and peripatetic above sheets of stacked piano notes, delivering empathy like a bar-side Irisman. These aren’t songs you’d really put on during a party or in a mix for a love interest. Basho’s sound is dramatic and yearning and very personal, altogether unapologetic for the way he saw the world.</p>
<p>What’s most remarkable about Basho is how busy and emphatic but absolutely effortless his songs could feel, especially when he touches the guitar. At once, Basho could appear to be laying it all on the line <i>and</i> simply breezing through the notes. During “Rocky Mountain Raga”, he practically howls as he sings “Oh, you grand Rockies,” pretending that he’s an opera star. But even so, his fingers are frantic and unfailing, delivering a perfect and convoluted stream of notes that never loses momentum just because he’s now got something to say. Early in his career, Basho was a rather plainspoken folk musician. A natural roamer, though, he developed an enthusiastic embrace of world religion and music-- from India to Ireland, from Native American lore to Sufi teachings. On <i>Visions of the Country</i>, those polyglot tendencies allow him to slip Middle Eastern accents and chamber ensemble flair into “Variations on Easter”, a four-minute fantasy that’s as close to a “simple” acoustic instrumental theme as he ever really got. Conversely, he’s comfortable singing a pretty song over somewhat plain chords, too. On “Blue Crystal Fire”, he sustains that falsetto, his voice curling like that of Antony Hegarty in a song that’s coincidentally about natural wonder-- “Smooth singing sunshine/ wrap your blanket around me.” Basho constructed his ecumenical complications above solid foundations. <i>Visions of the Country </i>uniquely shows every layer.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.gnomeliferecords.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gnome Life’s</a> reissue of <i>Visions of the Country</i> won’t be enough to resuscitate Basho’s reputation, to turn him, like Fahey, into shorthand for adventurous acoustic guitar. But that’s OK. Basho will never have the same broad appeal or the same cyclic story as Fahey. His music is, at first, rather off-putting, but ultimately, he imagined modes for the guitar and composition that we’re still reconciling. Marnie Stern sometimes maneuvers against her instrument in the same way, and James Blackshaw explores the same nebulous majesty. But Robbie Basho’s music mostly remains a pan-everything oddball, and <i>Visions of the Country</i> is, at last, once again living proof.</p></div>"|18390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18390-robbie-basho-visions-of-the-country/|8.7|Grayson Haver Currin

Even when their music's faltered, self-styled gypsy punks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1744-gogol-bordello/"" target=""_blank"">Gogol Bordello</a> have always found a way to make punk's tricky division problems work in their favor: when it's borders-- and the people who keep them in place-- that separate us, that ""us"" gets to be quite a crew. While the pointedness of Eugene Hütz and company's all-inclusive message has dwindled some on recent records, the overarching lesson holds: wherever you are, stand with us, the rabblerouser-slash-raconteur always seems to be saying, and eventually we'll figure it out. Hütz is, as ever, a vat of charisma, enthusiastic to a fault. At every turn on <i>Pura Vida Conspiracy</i>, Gogol Bordello's first LP in three years, sometime-thespian Hütz doesn't just deliver his lines, he devours them, like an actor chewing on the scenery. Whether he's trotting out his tried-and-true borders-as-scars metaphors--  long a popular topic for ex-refugee Hütz and the genre-meshing band he leads-- or spinning a wild yarn about a couple chatty midwives, he mugs and marionettes his way through <i>Pura Vida Conspiracy</i> like a man possessed. Hütz's vocal rigor is, itself, kind of an in-or-out proposition; you either find dude's world party cheerleader routine transfixing, or you wish he'd take it down a couple notches.</p>
<p>But if you don't mind Hutz in your ear for the better part of an hour, <i>Pura Vida Conspiracy</i> is the sharpest Gogol Bordello record in some time. Opener ""We Rise Again"" immediately stakes out its territory, as Hütz sings ""for the love of you, for the love of me, for the love of everyone who's yet to be free… we rise again!"" For every ""I"" or ""you"" on <i>Pura Vida</i>, there's a lot more ""we,"" and while Hütz, as ever, busies himself by drawing lines in the sand, he's always sure to place both you and him on the same side. ""We who seek long enough, dig deep enough, find a diamond in the rough one day,"" he belts throughout ""Dig Deep Enough"", strongly suggesting that you and the Ukranian-born, New York-transplanted, Brazil-based Hütz are travelers on the same path to glory.</p>
<p>And, though Pura Vida's forged from the same roots as past Gogol Bordello records—Eastern European folk melodies, politically savvy UK punk-- the music here feels less like a retread than a gathering of strengths. Where past Gogol Bordello records could steamroll right over you-- structure falling by the wayside as they'd rushing past verses to get to the breathless chorus-- even <i>Pura Vida</i>'s more boisterous moments feel carefully mapped out. The basic building blocks of Gogol Bordello's sound-- traditional Eastern European folk melodies matched to the energy of politically savvy UK punk-- have never really changed. But by tamping down the tempos a hair and not letting the embellishments overpower the songs themselves, <i>Pura Vida</i> feels like the fullest musical expression of Gogol's borderless sound since at least 2005's Steve Albini-recorded mission statement <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3495-gypsy-punks-underdog-world-strike/"" target=""_blank""><i>Gypsy Punks</i></a>. Sweeping fiddles and smears of Romani brass add color instead of blotting out everything around them. Flecks of ska, surf-rock, dustbowl blues all sneak their way onto <i>Pura Vida</i>. But where past Gogol records seemed to throw everything at you in the hopes that something might catch your ear, with <i>Pura Vida</i>, Gogol hang back just as much as they let loose, rolling into crescendos instead of barreling through them.</p>
<p>Firebrand-from-birth Hütz opts for a fairly conversational tone throughout much of <i>Pura Vida</i>, and this ""you and me both, brother"" routine is a few shades more compelling than the throat-shoveling confrontation that marred lesser Gogol records. A couple sweet, faintly supernatural love songs aside, Hütz is still rallying around the same flags he's always hoisting, upping individual freedoms while decrying institutional follies. But, next to some of Gogol Bordello's earlier outbursts, the message being conveyed here feels a bit less distinct, largely because Hütz seems to be relying on the listener to have already picked up at least a little bit of what he's been laying down. We can celebrate our differences without using them as a wedge, Hütz seems to be saying, and the disenfranchised everywhere need to band together: good advice, to be sure, but not far from what the eternally on-message Hütz has been saying all along. Without using his own story as an allegory for the plight of others as he's done in the past, every vague declaration here comes with an implicit ""you know what I'm saying"" attached, which makes <i>Pura Vida</i> more galvanizing than genuinely illuminating.</p>
<p>Between the spirited music and Hütz's delivery, you're not likely to walk away from <i>Pura Vida</i> feeling uninspired. But if you want to really hear what Gogol Bordello is saying on <i>Pura Vida</i>, a little history with the band is going to go a long way. Perhaps Hutz knows anybody picking up a Gogol Bordello LP in 2013 is part of the proverbial choir he's preaching to, and doesn't see the need to waste time with too much exposition. But the strongest Gogol Bordello record in a while would be all that much stronger if only Hutz could better elucidate to us just what's wrong with them.</p></div>"|18299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18299-gogol-bordello-pura-vida-conspiracy/|6.4|Paul Thompson

But in the wake of 2010’s decidedly more plugged-in and spaced-out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15106-kudos/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kudos</i></a>, their name has taken on decidedly different connotations. With a growing affinity for discordant frequencies and motorik rhythms chasing that imperfect sound forever, these guys make music for people whose idea of surfing involves a channel clicker; the only tans anyone’s getting here are from cathode rays. But, damn, is the sofa ever comfy, and on Surf City’s second full-length, this sort of spirited slothfulness codifies into a modernity-shunning mission statement.</p>
<p>Surf City songs tend to be differentiated only by which strain of Velvet Underground-inspired rock they choose to mainline on any particular day, be it the Krautrock pulse of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"" target=""_blank"">Neu!</a>, the stoner drone of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3</a>, or their formative, flagrant Flying Nunnery. On <i>We Knew It Was Not Going to Be Like This</i>, they tilt toward verbose Pavementian slop-pop, though Davin Stoddard is much more pointed in his fight-this-generation polemics than Stephen Malkmus’ notoriously oblique observations-- we’re no less than 40 seconds into the album before Stoddard’s spitting, “fuck the kids who don’t know what’s around.” It’s the first strike in Surf City’s war on totally wired, fractured and distracted 21st-century living, one that eventually sees Stoddard proudly proclaim, “I don’t change!” But Surf City aren’t just going back to those gold sounds, they’re updating them for their own ends. In his finest Thurstonian drawl, Stoddard builds the chorus of “NYC” upon a line from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>’s classic “Cotton Crown”-- “New York City is for every kitty”-- before adding this telling rejoinder: “But I don’t think I’m one of those kitties.”</p>
<p>Ironically, these statements of non-conformism are backed up by Surf City’s most streamlined batch of songs to date. On <i>Kudos</i> there was a real sense of the band taking their familiar influences and simultaneously distending and corroding them in search of a new noise. <i>We Knew It Was</i> rarely evinces the same boldness, proffering instead a steady procession of jangle-fuzz jingles that yield moments of brain-massaging beauty (the gleaming outros of “Song From a Short-Lived TV Series” and “What Gets Me By”, in particular) but little of Surf City’s more combustible qualities. And with the songs often adhering to simple A/B melodic patterns, only a subtle lean on the distortion pedal provides any indication that they’re coming to the chorus now. The penultimate “Oceanic Graphs of the Wilderness”, however, presents exciting new possibilities for this band-- with its looped psych-soul groove, brass accents, and Ira Kaplan-esque guitar freakout, the track serves as a portal to an alternative universe where Surf City have graduated from slackadasical slop-popsters to studio-tweaking sophisticates. Because even these dudes have come to the realization that, as comfy as slumbering on the sofa can be, there’s always the nagging feeling that you could be doing something more productive.</p></div>"|18306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18306-surf-city-we-knew-it-was-not-going-to-be-like-this/|6.6|Stuart Berman

<p>That’s rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30131-jonwayne/"" target=""_blank"">Jonwayne</a>’s reaction to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>’s verse on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15861-big-sean-control-hof-ft-kendrick-lamar-and-jay-electronica/"" target=""_blank"">“Control (HOF)”</a>, a verse which temporarily made rap seem like the competitive lyrical landscape it once was. Wayne’s response is telling: he shares Kendrick’s small-c conservative tendencies and longs for those halcyon (if not mythical) days where a rapper’s facility with a mic alone could elevate him to stardom.</p>
<p>His new mixtape <i>The Marion Morrison Mixtape</i> is the third of a series of cassettes the rapper's released with Stones Throw. Jonwayne is perfectly emblematic of the label's second generation of artists, with an offbeat sensibility and allegiance to rap's former glory but <i>Cassette 3</i> is set apart from its predecessors with a full flowering of Wayne's once nascent ambition.</p>
<p>Wayne originally made waves as a producer, and <i>Marion Morrison</i> is filled with a nice cohesion of recycled and original beats, all of which evince a boom-bap classicism with a slight psychedelic edge. There are beats from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Premier</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a>, and triangulating those three influences gives you a nice idea of where Jonwayne is coming from as a rapper and producer.</p>
<p>It takes some time for the tape to ease into a groove rap-wise. Wayne has a deadpan delivery that occasionally belies the intensity of his subject matter, and he has a penchant for slow-flow abstraction that can blunt the force of his rhymes. But by the time the DJ Premier produced-beat from Jeru Da Damaja’s “Black Cowboys”, rolls around, Wayne finds a nice balance and he doesn’t let up.</p>
<p>Wayne’s rhymes are laced with absurd shit-talk (“Rappers are falling off like hip-hop is having chemotherapy”) and a kind of workman’s log of his daily grind. There’s a mix of contempt and amusement in his discussion of other rappers balanced by a love for what he does (“rap could never die, that shit is a zombie.”) His ambition is palpable throughout-- the subject of many songs is simply that his skills merit attention-- but the constant demands for more are disguised by various lyrical devices which keep them from becoming tedious.</p>
<p><i>Marrion Morrison</i> is paced perfectly-- rappers often talk about the importance of track sequencing, but it’s rare to find a project on which every song is a legitimate improvement on the last. The last three songs here, “Dog iT” (which features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>’ cloaked alter ego <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30595-captain-murphy/"" target=""_blank"">Captain Murphy</a>), “Notes to Myself”, and the album-ending title track solidify the tape as the best thing that Wayne has ever done.</p>
<p>“Notes to Myself”, in particular, is a brilliant song, a harsh indictment of the artist, by the ghost of his better self that’s delivered in a sad, sympathetic tone which makes it ever more poignant. It’s a pensive call to action over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4365-donuts/"" target=""_blank""><i>Donuts</i></a>-era Dilla, on which Wayne takes the energy that he’s concentrated externally throughout <i>Marion Morrison </i>and focuses on himself. The song manages to be extraordinarily personal and wholly universal at the same time, the artist’s constant doubting distilled over wax.</p>
<p>That softening of the mixtape’s message is essential to its success and “Notes to Myself” and the accompanying monologue, which mythologizes the rapper’s namesake opens things up for “Marion Morrison”. Taking the beat from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Madvillainy</i></a> classic “Rhinestone Cowboy” is audacious, but Wayne does it full justice, wrapping up the <i>Cassettes</i> series with a place-staking bid for some measure of the spotlight. It’s a powerful moment after the hesitance of the track before and an annunciation for a skilled musician just beginning to receive the attention he craves and deserves.</p></div>"|18407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18407-jonwayne-cassette-3-the-marion-morrison-mixtape/|6.9|Jonah Bromwich

With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3998-superchunk/"" target=""_blank"">Superchunk</a>'s 10th album, <i>I Hate Music</i>, a collection that focuses on the forward march of time and the pain that goes along with it, this kind of commentary is unavoidable. </p>
<p>The Chapel Hill quartet has been a reliable and surprisingly consistent force for almost 25 years. They formed in 1989, a little bit before ""punk broke,"" during a time when people with their eyes on the underground and ears on college radio thought of the band's North Carolina hometown as an indie-rock Seattle. They released their ninth album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14642-majesty-shredding/"" target=""_blank""><i>Majesty Shredding</i></a> in 2010 after the almost 10-year hiatus following 2001's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7617-heres-to-shutting-up/"" target=""_blank""><i>Here's to Shutting Up</i></a>, and nothing much had changed: Superchunk still delivered amped-up, pogo-inspiring power pop. They've had a formula from the beginning, but it's one that works.</p>
<p>Their second post-hiatus record, <i>I Hate Music</i>, has a strong title that carries a deeper layer of meaning with it. They've released records upon records full of unbridled joy, frontman Mac McCaughan also records solo material as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3373-portastatic/"" target=""_blank"">Portastatic</a>, and he and bassist Laura Ballance are still going strong with their powerhouse indie label, Merge. So, no, Superchunk don't hate music. The sentiment speaks to something you find happening when you edge closer to 40 and beyond: loved ones start dying, and something that used to seem distant starts hitting close to home. As McCaughan sings on ""Me &amp; You &amp; Jackie Mittoo"": ""I hate music-- what is it worth?/ Can’t bring anyone back to this earth/ Or fill in the space between all of the notes/ But I got nothing else so I guess here we go…"" It's an ""I can't go on, I will go on"" sort of thing, and they create one hell of a ruckus in the process of moving on.</p>
<p>Like post-SST and then present-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur Jr</a>., the pace is a little slower here, some of the guitars quieter, and the production shinier, but the upward push of McCaughan's voice and that Superchunk momentum remains. (The acoustic and synth flourishes lend it a feeling similar to the early work of the more downcast, stripped-back Portastatic.) It's more grounded and focused than <i>Majesty</i>, and more thoughtfully reflective. Superchunk's best songs have always been the spastic ones, but though this is their darkest album to date, they don't fall into a midtempo torpor. McCaughan's nasal yowl can't help being anthemic, whether he's calling a co-worker a slack motherfucker, asking you to punch him harder, or, as in <i>I Hate Music</i>'s excellent opener, ""Overflows"", singing lines like: ""Everything the dead don’t know/ Piles up like magazines and overflows/ And everything that you won’t see/ Just swirls around/ Comes down and buries me."" The subject matter here stings.</p>
<p><i>I Hate Music</i> doesn't treat loss as vague or theoretical. The album's dedicated to a close friend of McCaughan and the band, the filmmaker and artist <a href=""http://filmmakermagazine.com/42019-david-doernberg-1967-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Doernberg</a>, who died after a battle with cancer in March of 2012. As McCaughan <a href=""http://portastatic.blogspot.com/2012/03/dave.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote in a blog post</a> around that time: ""I can't possibly enumerate the ways that Dave was intertwined into the fabric of our own family and lives. Likewise I have a feeling the hole that his passing leaves is larger than we even yet know."" Once you learn where the songs are coming from, the sad lyrics are sadder, the happy lyrics more wistful.</p>
<p>Doernberg haunts the record beautifully. McCaughan sings in the final song, ""What Can We Do"": ""Meet you on the corner every time it snows/ I’ve got wrinkles around my eyes/ I’ll say I love you, I won’t say goodbye,"" while the breezy ""Me &amp; You &amp; Jackie Mittoo"" references the Skatalites founder and the joy of hearing his music in a van with friends. On another standout, ""Trees of Barcelona"", McCaughan shares the wonderfully rendered memories of Portastatic playing Primavera Sound in 2007, and the friends who ran through the city when that set was over. The quieter, milder ""Your Theme"" asks for the impossible in simple terms: ""Oh what I’d do/ To waste an afternoon with you/ Eating obscure, looking at girls, shopping for jeans/ Learning how to be and not to seem/ Singing your theme.""</p>
<p>Thoughtful, quiet moments like that work but, this being Superchunk, the uptempo tracks still hit hardest. The fantastic ""FOH"", for instance, is cut from the same the cloth as Superchunk's raging best, as McCaughan asks a series of questions with few answers: ""Did you lose something?/ Oh, I lost something.../ Tell me, are you coming around?/ When are you coming around?"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29772-mount-moriah/"" target=""_blank"">Mount Moriah</a>'s Heather McEntire lends distant backing vocals to ""Breaking Down"", a jaunty song about fading memory. And things get especially amped on ""Staying Home"", a one-minute punk song about staying home that feels like their ""Screaming at a Wall"".</p>
<p>A song that combines both approaches is the the previously mentioned slow-builder, ""What Can We Do"" with its ""I won't say goodbye."" It's an epic recounting, and a fitting end to an album about listening to the music you loved with a friend and hating that music because it won't bring him back. But all the band can do is create more music anyway, offering up songs that will inevitably soundtrack other lives and deaths, too.</p></div>"|18365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18365-superchunk-i-hate-music/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

There was never a doubt that, based on raw talent alone, Sampha was not only an artist to keep a close eye on (the same year found him collaborating with then-upstarts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Jessie Ware</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29589-lil-silva/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Lil Silva</a>), but one with star potential. On the bracing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtvKfcla-EE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hold On""</a>, his vocals-- warm but damaged, understated yet dynamic-- ache with loneliness, whereas on more movement-minded concoctions like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwU9uOEeW3A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sanctuary""</a>, it's transformed into a conduit for light-speed, future-minded R&amp;B. In other words, Sampha's instrument is a dexterous one, effortlessly commanding attention in whatever context it's placed. Now after spending the past few years as an integral part of SBTRKT's live show, he's finally stepping out on his own with the deeply personal <i>Dual</i> EP.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> debuted his new single<i> ""The Motion""</i> in anticipation of his <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/08/02/drakes-new-album-nothing-was-the-same_n_3691516.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">forthcoming third record</a> <i>Nothing Was the Same</i>, with Sampha in tow on both vocal and production duties. Though Sampha's singing isn't featured prominently, the melancholic tug of his presence is felt in nearly every corner of the track, from the lighter-than-air atmospherics to his downcast, honeyed croon. It signified what could be a more noticeable arrival for Sampha, especially when coupled with the the release of <i>Dual</i>. But somewhat surprisingly, it feels as if he's pushing against the idea of an elevated profile with the 17 minutes of music that make up his first solo venture. Instead of acting as a grand coronation, <i>Dual</i> is a patient piece of work that finds Sampha in no rush to capitalize on a moment, instead opting to showcase simple, relatable musings on loss, uncertainty, and moving forward. At the same time, <i>Dual</i> carries a strange urgency with it, as if these songs <i>had</i> to come out of him now (despite their genesis going back years, in certain cases). The result is unexpected, but refreshing, with Sampha comfortably inhabiting the role of an artist interested in staying true to himself.</p>
<p>So it goes without saying that <i>Dual</i> isn't something you'll find yourself dancing much to (save maybe for the sultry <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15700-sampha-without/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">""Without""</a>, complete with plastic bucket street drumming and bleary synths). Instead, these ruminative, revealing songs paint a more intimate portrait of Sampha. There are ghosts hiding around almost every corner, like on the lost lullaby ""Beneath the Tree"", which finds him wishing a monster would ""take all its things and go."" Anchored by his delicate piano, it's the first thing that truly springs to life on the EP (it follows opener ""Demons"", one of two very short, homemade sounding one-offs). Sampha's relationship with keys are important to <i>Dual</i>; almost everything here seems to orbit around his voice and piano. The radiant ""Indecision"", with its gospel-like quality, feels as if it would be just as effective unplugged. But to do away with all the wonderful details, like those strange, mechanized backing vocal snippets, would be to ignore Sampha's deft ear for detail and his restrained but vibrant approach to mixing. These songs are nuanced and uncluttered. At the same time, the humanizing imperfections are never lost. (It's no wonder Drakes has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9164-sampha/"" target=""_blank"">revered him as a producer as much as a singer</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this probably means that many won't pay as much attention to Sampha as a bonafide songwriter. And it's a shame, because while a passing glance at these songs may not reveal many layers, his use of repetition and unfussy language afford <i>Dual</i> some startling emotional relevance. Closer ""Can't Get Close"" is sung for his late father, who Sampha lost at the age of nine and still regards as one of his most important musical influences. Tapping into something haunting and pure, he sings over a mournful weave of pitched vocals, lamenting, ""I can't get close to you."" The desperation is something that will resonate with anyone familiar with the helplessness of loss. For someone so willing to lay himself this bare as a first impression is rare, but in terms of the music found on <i>Dual</i>, nothing could be more natural. It's further proof that following the sound of your own voice is often more fruitful and rewarding than doing what everyone else expects of you.</p></div>"|18419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18419-sampha-dual-ep/|7.4|Zach Kelly

It's really up to bad timing-- Woods came into his own at around the same time younger listeners weren't having any of this ""underground rap that's not for partying"" business. But Woods has stayed busy. He runs <a href=""http://backwoodzstudioz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his own label</a>, puts out his own vision, and maintains camaraderie and connections with all the dedication of a restless idea machine. His last album, 2012's everyman-firebrand gem <i>History Will Absolve Me</i>, gave him a renewed mission-driven identity after a few years sharing the spotlight in the group Super Chron Flight Brothers. But as someone who tends to keep his face deliberately obscured in his promotional photos, Woods keeps tabs of what that identity looks like from the outside, and does what he can to claim it and own it to the point where it stays legitimately whole.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If </span><i>History Will Absolve Me </i><span>was a ""political"" record, then </span><i>Dour Candy </i><span>is its reflection, outlines of a day-to-day existence under all the toil and thought. Woods is a reference-heavy MC who tells stories from multiple angles and keep things evocatively multi-layered no matter how many asides and metaphors he tosses in. This is a record about doing shows, getting wasted, having sex, watching over the city-- stuff that gets so much play in lyrics that it's good to have a reminder that these things aren't actually mundane. They uplift you or they wreck you, sometimes one after the other, occasionally simultaneously.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And Woods has the words to back that up. When he's straightforward, he's a powerful scene-setter: the outset of ""The Undercard"", a narrative about the run-up to a live gig appearance, is filled with you-are-there details. When he gets abstract or free-associative, like he does with the hazy connections of ""Tinseltown"" or ""Manteca,"" there are phrases that stand out-- ""Optimistic?/ Every morning between my first sip of coffee/ Last digit on my scratch off ticket""; ""Knot in my sock, pot in the lungs, black on the skin/ Cops on the block, hands on their guns, piss in the wind""-- and keep the listener oriented and looking for those same insights in the more tangled syntax. But he doesn't spend a lot of time stuffing in unnecessary words; he's deep, but efficient.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The record's biggest draw for those unfamiliar with Woods is the fact that Blockhead produces it in its entirety. Given his extensive history with intricate MCs that demand close, repeated, interpretation-searching listens -- particularly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29-aesop-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Aesop Rock</a> (who turns up at his allusively weirdest here on ""Tumbleweed"") -- it's easy to see how a team-up like this could come to pass. And Blockhead's production is integral to upholding Dour Candy's ruminative momentum. Sometimes it's on multiple levels. It's no coincidence that Woods drops <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/960-clipse/"" target=""_blank"">Clipse</a> references on ""The Undercard"" over a grimier mutation of the sampled riff from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13767-til-the-casket-drops/"" target=""_blank""><i>Til the Casket Drops </i></a>opener ""Freedom"". More often, it's as simple enough as maintaining the sense of oddly melancholy cartoon futurism that comes with his best work-- slow-floating space graveyard drones on ""Gilgamesh"", eye-darting prog synths and ghostly wails on ""Manteca"", fourth-beer mariachi-soul horns weaving through ""One Thousand One Nights"". All in all, it completes a clearer picture of an artist who still hasn't let a lot of other people speak for him. </p></div>"|18405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18405-billy-woods-dour-candy/|7.8|Nate Patrin

Encounter any of its nine tracks, and “what <i>year </i>is this?” is a question asked with genuine befuddlement, not sarcasm. Their entire presentation-- the band name, the album title, the aquamarine cover, Sarah Versprille and Daniel Hindman relocating from Brooklyn to Portland-- instantly recalls pure blogging culture, something from the deadbeat summer of 2009. Then you take into account Versprille's dreamcatcher lyrics, which namedrop pentacles and wizened wanderers and push the 60s Laurel Canyon pop they’ve explored as part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4520-vetiver/"" target=""_blank"">Vetiver</a> into the cocaine 70s. But <i>Moon Tides </i>is also rife with 80s signifiers that range from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins</a> to Benny Mardones. The fact that this all goes on at the same time rather than piece by piece ensures <i>Moon Tides </i>actually coheres, but the underlying songs are so fetching and statuesque that you wonder why Pure Bathing Culture feels the need to play thrift store dress up.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15545-pure-bathing-culture-pendulum/"">“Pendulum”</a> makes it easier to take the necessary widescreen approach, an instantly alluring song that gets very confusing under close examination. Its main progression is rigid and bold, a descending three-chord riff you could seriously hear in a classic rock song if it wasn’t being played on pliable acoustic guitars that evoke the citric scent of a Mediterranean coast rather than funnel cake at the county fair. Versprille's lyrics somehow combine palatial Europe and cornpone Americana by getting deep into Ren Faire symbolism-- ""You're the cat's eye/ You're the pendulum/ When the orator says it's your time/ You're the one."" Those are the lines that her piercing vocals allow you to hear, but by the time it gets to the chorus, her words lapse into an amorphous, swooning gesture while the whole thing gets liquefied by wet reverb. Richard Swift produces it to feel like a sudden, sloppy tongue kiss and you appreciate how the words attempted to set the mood, but it was all prelude to the physical expression.</p>
<p>The dynamic between the wobbly production and the sturdy songwriting defines <i>Moon Tides, </i>though I wouldn’t say it causes any tension. Conflict is clearly something avoided within the tenets of Pure Bathing Culture. But it does result in a listening experience that causes more ambivalence than it probably should. You wonder if the herbal essence is compromised by the clarity of the melodies and lyrics, or vice versa, whether the disparate artistic impulses detract from each other rather than amplify each other’s qualities. When <i>Moon Tides </i>hits right, it has the consistency of a Jello shot-- simultaneously solid and gooey, warm and transportive, Versprille's acidic tone giving it a tart aftertaste.  </p>
<p>By the same token, when the balance is off or your mood is not compatible, the whole affair can remind you it’s a pretty chintzy way to have a good time. If you had to pinpoint an era where Pure Bathing Culture truly feels at home, it’s the 80s and not necessarily the <i>indie rock </i>80s. Those conditioned to hear the 4AD influences in any breathy, reverbed synth-pop can trace the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"" target=""_blank"">Kate Bush</a> and Cocteau Twins effect, particularly the latter-- the drum machines on <i>Moon Tides </i>are no more technologically advanced than those on <i>Treasure </i>and though it’s a little too easy to make out the content of lyrics like ""Sea-slicked symboled wants for more/ He draw's the Raven's card,"" the effect is similar to Elizabeth Fraser in setting an overarching mood of mysticism and a non-erotic sensuality.</p>
<p>But there’s a sneaking suspicion that Pure Bathing Culture are secretly repping for the kind of music made by millionaires to whom MTV was not kind during the Reagan era. The palm-muted guitar figures of closer “Temples of the Moon” make a serious pass at “Boys of Summer”, though it just reminds you of the vast difference between Don Henley’s idea of a “demo-sounding” cut and everyone else’s. Meanwhile, there’s a strange dissonance between the nonsensical or impenetrable narrative of “Scotty” and its 8-bit quiet storm arrangement. Until you realize it’s a three-minute segue into a coda taken straight from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bpOBAwrFVw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Into The Night""</a>; fortunately, it's the chorus, not the part that goes ""She's just 16 years old/ 'Leave her alone' they say."" Are they trying to show artistic kinship? Irony? Either way, Benny Mardones' lyrics become the most straightforward and earnest on <i>Moon Tides </i>and it's a little unsettling.<i><br/></i></p>
<p>You end up wondering how this presentation appeals to Pure Bathing Culture, whether they’re one of the many indie acts who think a lo-fi, homemade rendering of an expensive-sounding genre “fixes” it or if it’s just a reflection of their current recording budget and studio acumen.  What are their goals? Do they avoid polishing ""Pendulum"" and ""Scotty"" to a diamond-bright glare because they fear backlash or studio bills? Or none of the above? This sort of culture clash does have its charm, but in light of the professionalism, slickness and ambition that allows bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"" target=""_blank"">Chvrches</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a> to have real-deal hits, you realize when it comes to appropriating megabucks 80s pop, greed is good.</p></div>"|18379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18379-pure-bathing-culture-moon-tides/|6.8|Ian Cohen

Strut’s new <i>Mutazione: Italian Electronic &amp; New Wave Underground 1980-1988</i> offers a unique location in space, time, and aesthetics to daydream about, namely a too-good-to-be-true music scene in 1980s Italy where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"" target=""_blank"">Suicide</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"" target=""_blank"">Throbbing Gristle</a> made the same impact that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"" target=""_blank"">the Ramones</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3749-sex-pistols/"" target=""_blank"">Sex Pistols</a> had elsewhere, and Foucault and Sartre were considered rock stars on the same level as David Bowie and Iggy Pop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As appealing as <i>Mutazione</i> makes this particular place seem, it was actually fairly grim at the time. The 1968 student uprising that rocked society and politics across Europe reverberated in Italy longer than in other countries, and the nation was “on a war footing,” according to an essay in the compilation’s liner notes by Italian music journalist Alberto Campo: “on one side there is the extreme right wing and secret security’s degenreated fringes; on the other, the extreme left movements that had chosen the armed struggle.” In 1978 the leader of the country’s Christian Democratic party was kidnapped and assassinated by members of the Marxist-Leninist terrorist group Red Brigade; two years later the bombing of a rail station in Bologna that killed 85 people and wounded over 200 was attributed to the neo-fascist Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari. In Italy this period was known as the Years of Lead.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>According to recent interviews by journalist Andrea Pomini (who records electronic music under the name Repeater) with the members of the groups-- collected in an illuminating essay in the liner notes-- their music was a direct reaction to the hostile political atmosphere it was made in. The words “New Wave” and “electronic” might imply a certain brightly colored escapism, possibly with the Moroder-isms and discomania that defined most synth-based music being made in Europe at the time, but the material collected here is relentlessly dark, paranoid, and for the most part well out of bounds of even the most generously broad definitions of pop at the time.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The compilation begins the blurry, overdriven drum machine that introduces Die Form’s “Are You Before"", which is quickly joined by reggae-esque guitar and bass lines, a squealing free jazz saxophone, and vocalist F. White sinisterly stage-whispering second-person lyrics-- ""You are strange [...] you dislike everything""-- that implicate the listener in some sort of vague aesthetic thoughtcrime in between stridently barking the titular question. Listening to it on headphones feels like being in the center of a brainwashing session from a 70s political paranoia thriller.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Not every track on the collection is as harrowing of a listen. Neon, Carmody, and Pale TV are among the acts who contribute relatively upbeat cuts that you can actually dance to. But even the poppiest songs here are still deeply strange. Some of the musicians who played on the material collected here went on to mainstream pop success, but the most common musical references cited in Pomini’s interviews are such uncompromisingly harsh experimentalists as Suicide, Throbbing Gristle, the Residents, and Wire, and artists like Andy Warhol who are considered equally influential. It says a lot about how darkly intellectual the whole scene was that one of the members of Carmody, whose affably bleeping “Vulcani” is one of the most accessibly pop tracks on the compilation, says that the group as a whole was, “fascinated by the sensation of falling down deep into an abyss, a bottomless pit, an endless fall.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The material collected on Mutazione was never meant for mass consumption. Not only was that built into the most basic elements of the music itself, which was as antagonistic towards mainstream tastes as the British crust punk of the time, much of it was originally released on cassette, a throwaway medium even during its heyday, and many of the members collaborated via tapes sent through the mail on projects that were never even intended for release. On top of that there was a whole multimedia facet to what many of these bands were up to-- visual art, performance art, video art-- that even the niche audience who digs up <i>Mutazione</i> isn’t going to get.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But even though the stuff on <i>Mutazione</i> never spread far out of its original territory, its creators offer a sometimes haunting prescience for musical ideas that popped up independently in other communities around the world, and which still have resonance today. They devised weird signal chains running through gear that was never meant for that kind of thing. They took personal computers meant for geeky hobbyist programmers and used them to make music. They used cheap, disposable media to transmit subversive ideas encased in something that closely resembled pop</span>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This isolated community of radical freaks in the 1980s predicted everything from power electronics to Tumblr’s avant garde fringe. Grappling with new technology by figuring out interesting ways to break it? A pervasive feeling that some kind of terrible new totalitarianism is lurking just offstage? Blood in the air and on our broadcast media? <i>Mutazione</i> might be the most right-now sounding record out there.</span></p></div>"|18370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18370-mutazione-italian-electronic-new-wave-underground-1980-1988/|8.2|Miles Raymer

<p>For those uninitiated into the cult of Kozelek, such seemingly reverse-engineered lyrics might sound a bit cynical in their plain-spokenness: a bad-faith effort by a songwriter putting the least amount of effort possible into connecting words to form phrases and connecting phrases to form thoughts. On the other hand, these songs deliver grave truths, which means <i>Mark Kozelek &amp; Desertshore</i> may be an ideal starting point for nonbelievers trying to figure out why so many people care.</p>
<p>Taking the old adage “write what you know” as the alpha and omega of his process, Kozelek pens songs with very little fictionalizing imagination, or at the very least he slyly disguises his fabrications as matters of pure fact. So maybe he really didn’t buy <i>The Satanic Bible</i> at a mall in Ohio and maybe he really hasn’t actually met Anton LaVey, head of the Satanic Church, as he claims on “Hey You Bastards I’m Still Here”. But he sings those verses like pure autobiography, so you believe him, just as you believe him when he says he loves the movie <i>Papillon</i> and really misses <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2899-jason-molina/"">Jason Molina</a>.</p>
<p>Whether he’s singing solo or with collaborators like Desertshore or the Album Leaf, Kozelek presents his songs as aggressively autobiographical. Even “Don’t Ask About My Husband”, on which he sings from the point of view of a cheating wife, comes across as a work of empathy-- as though he’s trying to see the world from the point of view of a friend or lover. Because he lives so comfortably in his own words, even the most banal event in a Kozelek song accrues poignancy, if only because he’s doing it alone. These are solitary songs, sharply introverted and occasionally emotionally desolate, but they are never artless.</p>
<p>This collaboration with Desertshore-- a band featuring former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"">Red House Painters</a> guitarist Phil Carney, keyboard player Chris Connolly, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"">Sun Kil Moon</a> drummer Mike Stevens-- is Kozelek’s fourth full-length release of 2013, his second featuring all new compositions, and his second featuring a prominent collaborator. It’s also arguably his best of the calendar year, thanks to strong songs as well as the band’s sensitive accompaniment. Rather than evoke the romanticism of the road (as Sun Kil Moon did on 2003’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9958-ghosts-of-the-great-highway/""><i>Ghosts of Great Highway</i></a>) or the emotional detachment of touring life (as Kozelek does <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17626-mark-kozelek-live-at-phoenix-public-house-melbournelike-rats/"">on</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13015-lost-verses-live/"">every</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17365-mark-kozelek-on-tour-the-soundtrack/"">live</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12194-7-songs-belfast/"">album</a>), Desertshore pry open his brain and soundtrack his thoughts. On “Katowice or Cologne” and “Don’t Ask About My Husband”, Carney and Stevens put some rhythmic thrust behind Kozelek’s conversational cadence, and Carney’s guitar lends “You Are Not of My Blood” an eerie somnambulatory quality, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"">Slint</a> covering <a href=""http://youtu.be/1st_9KudWB0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Santo &amp; Johnny</a>.</p>
<p>They also tease out and amplify his sharp sense of humor, which can often get lost in his deadpan delivery. “I can play like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6049-robert-fripp/"">Fripp</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"">Johnny Marr</a>, and I can play circles ‘round <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1456-jay-farrar/"">Jay Farrar</a>,” he boasts or possibly just daydreams on “Livingstone Bramble”, and when he claims, “I hate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/778-nels-cline/"">Nels Cline</a>,” Carney inserts some scribbles and skreeks behind him, suggesting a very sly parody of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>’s artsy noise. It’s one of the album’s best moments-- and also its funniest.</p>
<p>Just when you think Kozelek might be relating his days without reflecting on them, he lays out a stunner of a lyric to catch you off guard. “Tavoris Cloud”, named after another boxer, laments the sudden passing of his pet cat (who “slipped off to kitty heaven”) and, much more seriously, the death of his friend<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46880-rip-sun-kil-moon-american-music-club-drummer-tim-mooney/""> Tim Mooney</a> of the San Francisco band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/222-american-music-club/"">American Music Club</a>. “I’m grateful for your love,” he sings, “but at the age of 46 I’m still one fucked-up little kid who cannot figure anything out.” The senselessness of death-- the universe’s utter antipathy toward human closure-- reduces us all to idiot children, but it makes Kozelek revel in the small moments, like watching an old boxing match or waking up next to the woman he loves. The power of this collaboration, which will hopefully be the first of many to come, is that sometimes he sounds like he can’t believe his good fortune.</p></div>"|18363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18363-desertshore-mark-kozelek-and-desertshore/|7.9|Stephen M.

The group, best known for its inclusion on <i>The Crow</i> soundtrack in 1994, didn’t leave behind a sizeable fan base, and while there’s been recent resurgence of interest in the decade’s shoegaze scene, to which the band was tangentially involved, they’re not exactly a household name.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If it’s a highly unexpected reconciliation, it’s also well timed. The combination of shoegaze’s aggressive guitar turbulence and dream pop’s phantasmagoric hookiness that they perfected on 1993’s <i>The Buried Life</i> sounded out of place at the time, but their new <i>To the Happy Few</i>, made with the same exact formula, now sounds perfectly situated at the leading edge of rock tastes.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The group’s sonic mastermind Brad Laner has spent much of the intervening years in the studio as a producer, engineer, and multi-instrumentalist on recordings by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4402--ziq/"" target=""_blank"">µ-Ziq</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1438-the-faint/"">the Faint</a>, among others, and he seems to have not only kept up with new technology and changing tastes, but to develop a whole range of new talents and techniques. (He also spent a little time in the early aughts attempting to relaunch Medicine as a more electronic-oriented project with new collaborators, but that part’s easily skipped over.) <i>To the Happy Few</i> will very likely turn out to be one of the best sounding guitar-based albums of the year.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And it’s the raw sonics where Medicine’s real appeal lies. Vocalist Beth Thompson has a gorgeously ethereal voice, especially when it’s multitracked several layers deep and drenched in reverb and modulation effects, as it often is. But while her uncomplicated melodies perfectly suit the group’s intentions and offer listeners a crucial personal identity to latch onto, they don’t do any more heavy lifting than any other instrument. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In fact, it’s usually pushed back deep in the mix, well behind Laner’s guitar. He’s an enthusiastic pedal junkie and a connoisseur of feedback, and one of the primary draws Medicine albums offer is a chance to see all the inventive ways he’s come up with to abuse a guitar signal. <i>To the Happy Few</i> has guitars that sound like squealing power drills, guitars that sound like sheets of white noise, guitars that sound like stroboscopic synth tones, and guitars that sound like Neil Young’s amp being recorded by a broken microphone that doesn’t pick up half the frequencies it’s supposed to. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Laner’s electronic phase has carried over from Medicine’s last incarnation, and the bulk of the songs here show some sort of dance music influence. Interestingly, it’s usually not in the form of synthesized sounds, as is usually the case in these kinds of cases. Instead it shows up in how he treats the stacks of guitars he piles up on each song, sweeping their frequencies like a rave DJ, saturating them with enough choppy distortion to start evolving into a quasi-synth sound, switching from one sound to another with edits he doesn’t even try to polish into an organic-sounding transition. (Drummer Jim Goodall’s noticeably beat-ier playing underlines the influence.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Their first time around, Medicine was an oddity: a band in L.A. drawing heavily from two quintessentially British sounds that hadn’t found any significant traction within 5,000 miles of their home base. If things had gone differently-- like not getting placed on <i>The Crow</i> soundtrack-- they could easily have ended up an obscurity known only to a few noise pop obsessives. (And as it is their emphasis on tone over melody will likely continue to limit their audience to listeners who are fine with records without memorable hooks.) But two decades later, musicians fusing arcane subgenres have become incredibly common, and everything else that Medicine was doing that was so strange-- putting their studio techniques up front, making their guitars sound like anything but guitars-- has also become the norm. Unlike the other reunited groups of their generation, Medicine doesn’t sound nostalgic at all, and in fact they sound more contemporary than the majority of young guitar bands playing right now. It’s just been a matter of waiting 20 years for the world to come around.</span></p></div>"|18320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18320-medicine-to-the-happy-few/|7.2|Miles Raymer

Don’t just listen to it on repeat, either: Hear it in different settings-- on different sound systems, in different rooms, sometimes in public places and, when possible, in private, with as few distractions as possible. If making that sort of commitment to a 75-minute album of largely wordless chants and torpid electronics doesn’t seem likely, maybe skip this one; its length and generally tectonic pace are easy targets for accusations of boredom. But if you want to live in a record and to treat every time it breathes or adjust its posture as a major event, <i>The Word as Power</i> is an architectural wonder-- an album that feels strangely interactive and dynamic, as though its music was never meant to be final.</p>
<p>For more than three decades, Lustmord has been the primary outlet of Brian Williams, an electronic arranger and producer with a broad view of darkness. Williams defined Lustmord’s central and largely stable aesthetic early into the project’s discography-- couch samples captured in oft-lugubrious places within foreboding sonic settings, with mile-wide craters of bass and razor-sharp veins of noise serving as the constants within alternating conceptual constructs. But as he’s refined the approach, particularly with a string of subgrene-galvanizing albums in the 90s, he’s attempted to expand its application, too. Not only has Williams pushed Lustmord’s lurch into video games and movies, he’s also invited other commanders of the bleak and heavy into Lustmord’s own slow folds. <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2010/11/03/lustmord-the-last-heretic/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In a 2010 interview with <i>Fact</i></a>, Williams talked about how creating and listening to the music of Lustmord was a very solitary experience. “I can’t imagine anyone listens to my music at a party,” he said, understating the case. But he’s worked with Nurse With Wound and stylistic progeny Larsen. He’s contributed to albums by both Maynard James Keenan’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4262-tool/"" target=""_blank"">Tool</a> and Puscifier. And he’s recorded with Isis’ Aaron Turner (on the great <i>[Other]</i>, which Turner released)<i> </i>and with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">Melvins </a>on 2004’s<i> Pigs of the Roman Empire</i>,<i> </i>a curious collaborative full-length. If Lustmord is solitary music, it’s created surprisingly often. That’s helped keep it vital during the last 30 years.</p>
<p>On <i>The Word as Power</i>, Lustmord continues that tradition of using outside sources to build from his clear and consistent artistic base. Here, he pairs long, slow, and steady vocal takes from five singers with his usually sedate machinations of plunging bass and droning textures. The distant, near-monastic intonations of Maynard James Keenan, for instance, echo as though from the mouth of a cave on “Abbadon”, fading in and out of a punishing electronic web like they’re being whipped by a gale. He practically bullies Jarboe’s bewitching tone on “Andras Sodom”, occasionally letting it drift like smoke above a fire only to soon scramble, reverse or otherwise warp it.</p>
<p>But it’s the fair-voiced Aina Skinnes Olsen who serves as Williams’ most malleable material on <i>The Word as Power</i>. She takes the spotlight on four of its seven tracks. Sometimes she sings solo, her clear tone sending notes sailing into a great, yawning void. Elsewhere, Williams fashions her voice into ghastly, crisscrossing duets with his electronics, her purity taunted by his menace. And sometimes, he even multiples her sound as though with mirrors, turning her into a choir of phantasms capable of overrunning his own din. On “Chorazin”, the album’s 17-minute centerpiece, Williams blurs the distinctions between this troika of roles, lifting Olsen’s voice above perilous stillness before letting it slip, if only momentarily, into a rapturous vortex. </p>
<p>Lustmord uses a very broad spectrum of sounds-- foundation-quaking lows beneath the singers’ throat-rattling mids and almost-vaporized highs-- to create a very intricate microcosm of music. Each time you listen, you notice something new. That’s the point, too, as illustrated by the record cover, a Simon Fowler design in which a maze of symbols and words and shapes and watermarks is intended to reveal more about the source material only with careful and repeated study. (“Those looking to properly decode the subject matter of the album are advised to study Simon Fowler’s fiendishly elaborate, double-spread cover illustration,” teases the album’s accompanying materials.) This material is meant for furrowed brows.</p>
<p>But the real trick of <i>The Word as Power</i> is its plasticity. Because of the range of sound at work,<i> </i>each time you listen in a different setting, the struggle between the warlord bass and the angelic-and-or-demonic voices shifts slightly, revealing new relationships about passages you thought you already understood. It’s like staring at a particularly detailed painting by Bruegel the Elder up-close in the light of day and then, later, from some distance at twilight.</p>
<p>When discussing the isolation of this sort of music in <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2010/11/03/lustmord-the-last-heretic/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that 2010 <i>Fact</i> interview</a>, Williams also spoke of the arduous process of creating Lustmord’s music: “In the studio, I can spend hours on individual sounds,” he said. “Things take days if not weeks to develop.” That process affords <i>The Word as Power</i> a certain inescapability: When you start to pay attention to its manifold subtleties, you’ll likely only lean in closer, noticing even more details within an album that suggests they never end.</p></div>"|18330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18330-lustmord-the-word-as-power/|7.7|Grayson Haver Currin

Can he write and record an entire album made out of nothing but clichés? The most threadbare chord progressions? The most predictable lyrics? The same standard-issue touchstones-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"" target=""_blank"">Television</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5449-the-modern-lovers/"" target=""_blank"">the Modern Lovers</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>-- that his last band, the Ponys, wound up settling on? With <i>The Affliction</i>, the debut by his new outfit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31563-bare-mutants/"" target=""_blank"">Bare Mutants</a>, the answer to all the above is a yawning “Yeah, I guess.” But where the Pony’s 2007 swansong, <i>Turn the Lights Out</i>, showed some promising progression for Gummere as a songwriter, <i>The Affliction</i> is a head-retracting shrug back into the shell.</p>
<p>You can't accuse the album of lacking consistency. No less than half the songs follow the same infuriatingly precise formula-- strummy, two-chord intro followed by dreamy buildup followed by full-bore freakout-- without deviating from the template VU threw down long ago with “Heroin”. (Let that sink in: a large portion of this album sounds not only exactly like VU, but exactly like “Heroin”.) Occasionally Gummere and crew branch out-- like on the jaunty, bittersweet “Nothing Is Gold”, which is one of two songs that effectively utilize backup singer Jeanine O’Toole, also of the 1900s, as a full duet partner. (That said, “Nothing Is Gold” sounds like VU’s “After Hours”.)</p>
<p>O’Toole makes an even stronger showing on “Cunt”, one of the few glimpses of the rich, thrilling range-- both tone-wise and inspiration-wise-- that Gummere is capable of, if only he’d bother more often. Ragged, glammy, and sauntering on broad stomps of bubblegum boogie, “Cunt” gives Gummere and O’Toole enough fresh air to trade verses in a vivifying rush of power-pop fun. Conversely, the album’s other standout track, “I Suck at Life”, falls way down on the despondent end of the spectrum, although it’s buoyed by a streak of grim wit, Gummere’s gluey croon, and a colossally sloppy guitar solo that’s nearly as good as Dean Wareham’s sloshed pyrotechnics in Galaxie 500.</p>
<p><i>The Affliction</i>, then, has two speeds: copying the Velvet Underground and copying <i>other</i> bands that copy the Velvet Underground. What helps mitigate the disc’s unconcern with its lack of dynamic is the fact that Gummere the singer has never sounded better. His jittery Tom Verlaine yelp on the Ponys’ stellar first album, 2004’s <i>Laced With Romance</i>, has gradually given way over the past 10 years to a warm, worn-smooth murmur, and that low-level hum of atmosphere serves songs such as “Devotion” well, even if little else in the song does-- including Gummere’s lyrics, which rarely dare to try rising above boilerplate angst and vagueness. On top of lazy phrasing, he recycles many specific words and images throughout, including repeated mentions of the ocean. Then again, that <i>is</i> the name of a VU song.</p>
<p>The lack of ambition on <i>The Affliction</i> is almost ambitious. The Ponys never broke through to the level they could, and maybe even should have, so it isn’t surprising that, after a six-year hiatus, Gummere is simply coasting on what he loves most-- as narrow as that wave of overused influences may be. Despite a few lovely moments, <i>The Affliction</i> sounds more like an album made for him than anyone else. But with a voice so suffused with dimension and soulfulness, he could have doubled down on Bare Mutants, crafting songs that might better enhance and convey that soul. Instead, the band plays it straight, workmanlike, distractingly derivative, and blandly safe. It’s a lot easier to win bets when you hedge them.</p></div>"|18377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18377-bare-mutants-the-affliction/|5.5|Jason Heller

Suffice to say there are countless other approaches, both new and old, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27789-the-horses-ha/"" target=""_blank"">the Horse’s Ha</a>, a long-running if rarely recorded collaboration between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1324-eleventh-dream-day/"" target=""_blank"">Eleventh Dream Day</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1553-freakwater/"" target=""_blank"">Freakwater </a>stalwart Janet Bean and journeyman singer/guitarist James Elkington, showcase several on their second album, <i>Waterdrawn</i>.</p>
<p>In contrast to their sprawling first effort, 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13274-of-the-cathmawr-yards/"" target=""_blank""><i>Of the Cathmawr Yards</i></a><span>, </span><i>Waterdrawn</i><span> is a more focused, stripped down collection. The band here is less an ensemble led by Bean and Elkington and more the two core performers-- though strings do still play a role throughout. On first blush it's easy to note the performers’ clear and open love of noted singers like Shirley Collins-- there’s that sense of immediate, focused performances done with little fuss, Bean and Elkington’s voices matched in close harmony without overt finesse. Similarly, their guitar performances seem unadorned and steady, bespeaking their experience by means of calm understatement.</span></p>
<p>But again, that’s on first blush. Though there’s nothing as immediately striking as breaking into<i> </i>a bossa nova-tinged number like <i>Of the Cathmawr Yards</i>' “Left Hand”, the Horse’s Ha are less about revivalism then they are the employment of their own easy-going aesthetic. For instance, the sudden punctuation of guitar at the start of the title track leads into a brisk arrangement that’s a kissing cousin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Drake</a>’s “Cello Song” but with a queasy string secton that feels like a snippet of a raga alongside a sudden swirl of flutes. And it's anything but simple cheery good times, even while Bean and Elkington’s vocals establish a feeling of calm restraint.</p>
<p>Bean’s opening line on the first song “Conjured Caravan”, “Lately I don’t try to linger,” sounds equally at home in Appalachia as in Cumbria, while the sudden shift away from the sprightly guitar to a single violin towards the song's end adds subtle drama to an already strong number about starting something up and hitting the road. Bean’s differently cast lead on the following song, “Willing Hands”, helps introduce the careful variety throughout the album, as does the song’s shifts between waltzing paces, steady fingerpicking, and sudden stops and hushes. (That one of the loveliest tracks on the album is called “Stick Figure Waltz” makes perfect sense.)</p>
<p>Bean has general pride of place on much of the performances, usually singing first and in a couple of cases taking sole lead, but Elkington’s role never feels secondary. It’s more the sense of a well-matched performer happily contributing to a whole. Sometimes, as on the easy going counry-tinged “A Stony Valentine”, Elkington’s vocals are the perfect extra element: Hearing him sing a line of the chorus by himself then returning to back Bean at the song's conclusion is one of those punch-in moments as thrilling as the right pedal stomp or bass drop.</p>
<p>Track for track, the basic approach may remain generally the same, but something’s always changing, whether it’s pace, lyrical focus, or simply the core sonic texture (often within the same song). The stateliness that begins and drives “Contenders” starts with banjo, builds up with guitar, adds strings, and reaches a long pause for Bean’s singing, then continues while the strings glide serenely in the mix, a background, genteel tension that’s its own treasure of a moment. When the building moment is repeated later, the extra elements become a soft click of percussion and quick guitar filigrees, neatly avoiding a repetition within the song itself. The Horse’s Ha are clearly anything but slapdash here, and that’s the key for <i>Waterdrawn</i><span> as a whole, a wonderful treat from artists at their best.</span></p></div>"|18374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18374-the-horses-ha-waterdrawn/|7.5|Ned Raggett

It’s a simple request, as well as the dividing line between those who think of Washed Out as an evocative catalyst of warm nostalgia and those who hear Greene as someone fumbling around for a tune like he's trying to find the snooze button. Four years after “Feel It All Around” defined chillwave, and two since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15614-within-and-without/""><i>Within and Without </i></a>stood against the backlash, <i>Paracosm </i>presents Greene as a man without a movement, someone whose music can no longer be used to project opinions about a larger trend. Due to the attrition of his peers and imitators, as well as his own artistic refinement, this sound is all his now. While <i>Paracosm </i>isn’t going out of its way to convert anyone, it’s a modest display of staying power<i>, </i>proof that Greene is a niche artist who hasn't yet suffered from redundancy. </p>
<p>Greene’s referred to <i>Paracosm</i> as “daytime psychedelia,” a response to its predecessor’s nocturnal amorousness. Once again working with producer/engineer Ben H. Allen, the album's instrumentation sloshes around in lush, warm reverb and palpable bass frequencies. As such, each song is sensual and immersive, indulgent and often feeling shorter than their average five minute length would suggest. While <i>Paracosm</i> never rocks, it always knocks, as few producers are better than Allen at ensuring indie artists stress the low end. Under his hand, the tactility of Washed Out’s studio albums have stood out in comparison to any drizzly replicas that have followed.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <i>Paracosm </i>finds Greene doing subtle and effective troubleshooting. Though <i>Within and Without </i>wasn't a huge change for Washed Out's aesthetic, it was understandable why people who enjoyed his earliest work might’ve been turned off: “Feel It All Around” had an organic, homemade ingenuity, but <i>Within </i>blended nearly every known variant of makeout music-- shoegaze, Balearic, trip-hop, chillwave, R&amp;B-- into a silken, sweet whole.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>Paracosm </i>possesses more texture, which can be partially attributed to the presence of a live rhythm section. “Entrance” begins with chirping birds, and elsewhere there's snippets of laughter, harps, house parties, bongos, and slight swings of human imperfection in the rhythm section. “It All Feels Right” bumps with light reggae upticks before momentarily collapsing into a sunstroke, while “Great Escape” leans off the beat just enough to generate a little bit of Southern soul.</p>
<p>The range of <i>Paracosm </i>helps Greene present himself as more of a singer/songwriter than a producer,<i> </i>though the former part of that dynamic still lags. His voice is an effective and imperfect apparatus that suggests rather than commands; his enunciation is still slack, as hard consonants and most vowel sounds dissolve into a semipermeable gauze. Maybe it’s for the best, though, since the lyrics of “It All Feels Right” are indicative of how much of <i>Paracosm</i> boils down to “Have a nice day” and not much more. However, Greene is growing in terms of melodic construct, as the chorus of “Don’t Give Up” is the strongest and trickiest he’s ever written. The way he manages the song's nimble rhythm suggests Washed Out’s future depends more on the development of Greene’s internal instruments rather than the external ones.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Paracosm</i>’s diversity<i> </i>leaves its individual songs subject to more scrutiny than they were on its overly cohesive predecessor. “Weightless” is equal parts Cocteau Twins and Calgon, but its soapy texture wants for Elizabeth Fraser’s fierce elocution and command of syllabic nonsense. And whether or not “Great Escape” is an intentional homage to “Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)”, it’s probably in Greene’s best interest not to remind listeners of the difference between his vocals and those of Marvin Gaye.</p>
<p>When Greene misses the mark, it’s a demonstration of his musical limitations as well as a counter to the misconception that Washed Out is unambitious or complacent. It’s not unthinkable for Greene to take notes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83"">M83</a>’s Anthony Gonzalez, another innovator in electro-pop ambience who learned to transcend the mumbly vocals of his early work by gradually embracing the role of a true frontman while working with powerhouse guest vocalists as well. But <i>Paracosm </i>is a document of someone who sounds <i>satisfied</i> with his place in life, and that can understandably drive people nuts. There’s plenty of art responsible for describing and inducing vertiginous highs and lows, and <i>Paracosm</i> is more than happy to soundtrack the satisfying moments that seek you out instead of the other way around, effectively triggering the kind of subtle joys that course through you without warning – manageable contentment, sustainable romance.</p>
<p>Those moods are easy to dismiss when they're captured in a lyric like ""Call your friends, I'll call mine/ We'll head out for a long ride/ Sun is coming out now, it all feels right."" There's a cognitive dissonance, and maybe some embarrassment, in recognizing that emotional state and hearing it expressed back to you in such naïve, plainspoken language.  You can call it a guilty pleasure in action-- or, you can just take this accessible escapism at face value and just, you know, feel it.</p></div>"|18324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18324-washed-out-paracosm/|7.4|Ian Cohen

Even leaving aside every radical mutation and crossover blowup that's splintered off from the dancehall, grime, and dubstep scenes that ran through the album's veins, Martin himself has proven to be just as hard to pin down. The eerie, stripped-down ghost-dub <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27867-king-midas-sound/"" target=""_blank"">King Midas Sound</a> evolved from side project to remixers' platform to ongoing concern (don't sleep on the “Aroo” single). Kiki Hitomi, the wraithlike vocalist who's served as a regular collaborator with Martin across multiple projects since 2009, teamed up with him to explore heavier digital dub styles as Black Chow. And the last time anything was released under the Bug name proper, it was a series of 7” records on Martin's aptly-named Acid Ragga subsidiary label late last year that were abrasively confrontational in the best way, stuff that sounds like a future path few have successfully caught on to yet. Familiar comfort is not what you should expect out of him.</p>
<p>And yet familiarity is what you get on the <i>Filthy </i>EP-- familiar names, familiar rhythms, familiar beats. Not enough to breed contempt, but just enough to make it clear that it's not one of his more revolutionary releases. The last time five years passed between Bug albums, the difference between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1086-pressure/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pressure</i></a>'s glitchy dancehall and the blistering ragga/dubstep of <i>London Zoo </i>pointed to an engaged expansion of an already versatile toolbox. <i>Filthy</i> is more like using whatever nearby blunt object as a hammer. The two twice-versioned beats that comprise the EP are strong and borderline anthemic but nothing all that revelatory: the drum patterns are solid but simple, the basslines throb but don't really explode, and the melodic elements (such as they are) more or less churn in place, with insistent horn blats (“Freakshow”/”Dirty”) and warped calliope synth (“Kill Them”/”Louder”) doing more to reinforce the beat than play off it. It's heavy stuff, but Martin's wheelhouse is bigger than this.</p>
<p>Most of the vocal collaborators are previously known quantities, too-- good ones, but only one of them an actual change of pace. Roll Deep cornerstone Flowdan, one of the strongest presences on <i>London Zoo </i>and several Bug singles released beforehand, shows up twice and gives his booming, gravelly drone of a voice a thorough run. And while he sounds fired up sneering at horsemeat fast food on “Dirty” or challenging sound systems on “Louder”, neither of them sounds like a major advancement from the 2007-08 run of collaborations that included the likes of “Warning”, “Ganja”, and “Jah War”. Daddy Freddy's leafblower-growl turn on “Kill Them” covers the dancehall front, but the juxtaposition of a previous <i>Pressure </i>collaborator running amok on the dubstep-styled turf that <i>London Zoo </i>laid down is more a quick jolt of recognition than a sustained rush of the new. That leaves us with the leadoff track, “Freakshow”, in which Hitomi wails in that odd hushed midpoint between vulnerable and threatening before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>'s libido goes nova during a characteristically unhinged sing-song rampage. (All I'll say about the lyrics is that you'll probably want to start ordering your Caesar salad with vinaigrette from here on out.) It's the one moment that actually feels exciting and daring instead of just reassuring, and on the heels of Darq E Freaker teamup “Blueberry (Pills &amp; Cocaine)” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31011-the-purist/"" target=""_blank"">the Puris</a>t's “Jealousy”, it does just as much to reinforce Brown's unique chemistry with UK producers as it does to play up Martin's collaborative insight.</p>
<p>Not that a two-riddim EP this short is much of a harbinger of anything. As a teaser for the upcoming <i>Angels &amp; Devils</i>, it does less to stir up oh-shit anticipation for a devastating blindside of a record than the prospect of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28603-gonjasufi/"" target=""_blank"">Gonjasufi</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips</a> collaborations do. If you're looking for evidence of any major stylistic shift in Martin's approach on <i>Filthy</i>, it's better to settle for a solid reiteration of a lot of the stuff he was doing on his last album. Who knows-- this might be the last chance you get with it.</p></div>"|18062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18062-the-bug-filthy-ep/|6.5|Nate Patrin

Some of these debut efforts, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a>'s masterful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18091-disclosure-settle/"" target=""_blank""><i>Settle</i></a> and <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"" target=""_blank"">AlunaGeorge</a>'s R&amp;B-leaning <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18298-alunageorge-body-music/"" target=""_blank""><i>Body Music</i></a>, have already hit North American shores; others, like singles from smoky, soulful crooner John Newman and garage producer Naughty Boy, have yet to make a transatlantic connection. The latest salvo from across the pond comes courtesy of London quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31420-rudimental/"" target=""_blank"">Rudimental</a>, whose debut record <i>Home</i> earned a #1 British debut in April on the heels of two chart-topping hits, ""Feel the Love"" and ""Waiting All Night"". </span></p>
<p><span>Rudimental's members-- Piers Aggett, Kesi Dryden, Amir Amor, and DJ Locksmith-- pride themselves on lending an earned musicality and eclecticism to dance music. The group's name draws from Dryden's childhood piano lessons: he was routinely disciplined for forgetting his rudiments, a book containing elementary principles of rhythm and musical theory. Their experiential approach to songwriting is evident throughout <i>Home</i>'s dozen tracks, many of which are stuffed to the brim with disparate parts and unfold in unexpected ways. </span></p>
<p><span>More than a few songs on <i>Home</i> feature frenetic drum 'n bass loops, and the success of those songs varies. ""Feel the Love"" launches warped synth lines and horn riffs alongside a gritty guest performance from Newman before abruptly switching gears in its final third; ""Waiting All Night"" rides a star-making spot from young vocalist Ella Eyre to similar heights. But the tracks that follow a similar template feature soaring but ultimately bland vocals overwhelmed by their rhythmic counterparts. </span></p>
<p><span><i>Home</i>'s finest moments occur when Rudimental stray from the sound that led them to chart success. The album's two best songs were co-written and sung by British up-and-comer MNEK, who possesses a rich, nuanced voice at the age of 18. ""Spoons"" glides on a gently pulsing synth and a clicking percussive line tapped out on the titular instrument; the skittering, mid-tempo ""Baby"" features interplay between MNEK and a sparkling, sassy Sinead Harnett. The relatively straightforward house of these songs stand with the best of this year's strong batch of British pop singles.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><i>Home</i>'s American release is poorly timed. In recent months, their contemporaries have released well-crafted, self-assured debuts. Rudimental are casting a wider musical net than their peers, which has the unintended effect of magnifying their flaws by comparison, making for a decent but ultimately second-tier effort in a crowded year for big-ticket dance-pop. <br/></span></p></div>"|18372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18372-rudimental-home/|6.4|Jamieson Cox
