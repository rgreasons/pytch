And their recent work, peaking on 2001's <em>Cold House</em>, took another startling turn, toward Anticon's glitchy hip-hop aesthetic. This abiding sense in Hood's work of the pastoral slowly giving way to technology is mirrored in band member Chris Adams' one-off solo project, Bracken.</p><p>
    Adams drew an analogy between producing <em>We Know About the Need</em> and assembling flat-pack furniture. ""A lot of square pegs,"" he admitted, ""end up being forced into round holes."" His approach gives the record a charming incoherence. Adams riffs on his old band's signature sounds: the drone (""Evil Teeth"", ""La Monte Lament""), the hiccuping futurism (""Safe Safe Safe"", ""Many Horses""), and textures you can swim in (""Heathens""). What marks <em>We Know</em> is a pronounced dubstep vibe, a haunting emphasis on the low-key and the low end.</p><p>
    ""Of Athroll Slains"" announces this emphasis, resting on its moody, clattering rhythms, as Adams sings with a halting delivery that unfurls into sleepy melisma. It's as close to a disembodied voice as it gets. He perfects the mixture of atmosphere and dub thump on lead single ""Heathens"". The density of the sound-- a soup of horns, organs, guitars, reverb-soaked vocals-- makes the song sound like screwed-and-chopped background noise. But in a good way. There are untold details to sift through, melodies to follow, in the washes of pirate-radio static.
    </p><p>
    For every person bored to tears by dubstep, 100 are bored by drone. Yet Adams' flirtations with willful monotony always leave something for the ear: the lushly Gregorian ""Music for Adverts""; the drum solos and humming cello of ""Evil Teeth""; the quivering, unbroken tone of ""La Monte Lament"". These forays into stillness work as well as their can't-stand-still foils, from the fluid and urban <em>musique concrète</em> of ""Fight or Flight"" to the twitches of nervous digitalism on ""Many Horses"", humanized by the clarinet and piano. They manage to be warm and icy, mechanical and natural, at the same time. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not until we round back to the closing track  ""Back on the Calder Line"" does the repetition start to tire, as Adams attempts to recreate the anomie-laden majesty of ""Heathens"", building on glacial beats, his ghostly phrasing, and fingerpicked notes. Nevertheless, <em>We Know About the Need</em> emerges as a slippery, engrossingly genreless take on the old theme of desolation in the city.

Easy, and accurate: The group's slamming beats, grinding noise, and dizzying changes all evoke the Providence duo. The catch is, Jackwacker only existed between 1993 and 1995, when Lightning Bolt was just an idea in the art-school brains of Brian Gibson and Brian Chippendale.</p><p>
    During that brief career, Jackwacker shared the stage with like-minded destroyers including Flying Luttenbachers, Scissor Girls, and Lake of Dracula. But mostly the band ground out its frenetic songs in a Bloomington basement, appearing only on a few 7"" comps and a rare cassette. <em>Things From Inside Your Body </em>collects all that material, plus a trove of previously unreleased tracks.</p><p>
    On first listen, one difference between Jackwacker and Lightning Bolt seems to be the presence of guitar. But what sounds like a trio is actually the duo of Rob Stockwell and Elijah Pritchett, the latter playing a hybrid axe equipped with three guitar strings and three bass strings. Pritchett's sound is fascinatingly schizophrenic. His buzzing bass tones dominate, but they also burn with trebly accents, like an smoky explosion with fiery edges. The addition of Stockwell's crashing drums creates a violent mix-- metal riffs, jazz tempos, hardcore pound, and harsh noise all fight for space. The resulting swirl is so forceful it seems to alter the listener's pulse.</p><p>
    Jackwacker's neck-breaking compositions can feel more like exercises than songs, but its best moments fold high-wire technique into simple songs. ""Thighmaster"" massages a plodding beat into a caffeinated rave-up, while ""Messin' With the P-Hole"" juxtaposes lumbering bass with quiet noodling.  Later, ""Frontal Lobe Blues"" stretches a rolling riff into two fluid halves-- one part jazzy, Sun City Girls-like syncopation, one part Ruins-style pound.  The incessant turns are impressive, but Jackwacker can also let go: On ""Prader Willy"", a mess of distortion and screams rivals the cacophony of Harry Pussy and Sightings. </p><p>
    If <em>Things From Inside Your Body</em> has a flaw, it's a fatiguing monotony.  Though individual tracks gain momentum through repetition, the album at times sags under its own relentlessness. Jackwacker does save the best for last though: ""Knothead"" rides a circular riff into infinity, and ""Six-Foot, Two-by-Four, New, Panhandle Rag"" follows by slowly melting under the heat of the group's searing energy.</p><p>
    Jackwacker broke up soon after recording these songs, but those final, endless-sounding tracks suggest Pritchett and Stockwell might still be holed up in Bloomington, pounding away at any riffs and beats they can find. At the very least, it's fun to put <em>Things From Inside Your Body</em> on repeat and imagine that they are.</p></div>"|9761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9761-things-from-inside-your-body/|7.5|Marc Masters

    With Menomena, you always get a total package. Their first
    album, 2003's <em>I Am the Fun Blame Monster</em>,
    came with a hand-assembled flip book, complete with moving anagrams. The vinyl
    edition took the packaging a step further: It folded up into an origami monster with a moving mouth. Their second outing, a
    minimalist ballet score cutely titled <em>Under
    an Hour</em>, came in a stark, mostly white container that looked a lot like the music it contained. And <em>Friend and Foe</em>, their third, has possibly the most brilliantly executed cover
    art of the decade.</p><p>
    Illustrated by Craig Thompson of ""Blankets"" fame, the front
    cover has eight possible permutations, four when the CD is in the case, and four
    when it's in the player (it'll be there a lot)-- and that's not counting all of
    the slight variations you can get by rotating the disc when it's in the tray.
    The drawings-- a hellish, humorous freak universe on their own-- are punched with
    holes to reveal other worlds behind them, full of characters, snippets of
    lyrics, and the record-fetching dog from the Barsuk logo.</p><p>
    Most cover art frankly isn't even worth talking about in the
    CD age, but this is so unique that it warrants deeper
    discussion than I can give it here. And speaking of the total
    package, Menomena deliver just as spectacularly on record. While <em>Under an Hour</em> could rightly have been seen as a detour or stopgap
    after <em>Blame Monster</em>, <em>Friend and Foe</em> follows
    through on the potential of their unique sound, proving their
    wildly great debut was no fluke. 
    </p>
<p>
    Menomena don't even give you time to doubt them. Their signature modular pop is at its most
    effective on opener ""Muscle'n Flo"". Crashing drums lead you in, dropping out after
    just seconds in favor of a pulsating bassline and the prosodically delivered
    line, ""In the morning I stumble towards the mirror."" From this sparse
    beginning, the music blossoms with brimming intricacy,
    adding slashing guitar as the drums kick back in with a vengeance. The song is
    a total rollercoaster, eventually collapsing into a quiet interlude that sets up a
    brilliant moment where an organ figure that had been a barely noticeable
    background component suddenly rises to the fore and leads into a beautiful, floating
    passage of impassioned vocal harmonies. And that's just one of
    dozens of ingenious, spine-tingling details offered on the album.
    </p>
<p>
    The band's technique of building songs from improvised loops
    arranged with custom software yields bigger, more developed compositions and
    stronger songwriting than on records past. ""Wet and Rusting"" is one of their most
    conventionally memorable songs to date, but also one of their most
    interestingly varied, as the textures that lie beneath the vocals constantly shift.
    It places the same rushing piano passage over two completely different rhythm
    tracks and makes it sound amazing both ways. ""The Pelican"" is a relentless
    stomp, nearly matched a few tracks later by ""Weird"", whose intense beat and
    ominous low-end groan slides through a tricky meter. 
    </p>
<p>
    With the exception of the majestic, fractured pop of ""My
    My"", the back half of the album is a great deal more abstract than the front,
    as it was on their debut. ""Evil Bee"" revolves around the refrain, ""O, to be a machine/ O,
    to be wanted/ O, to be useful,"" and backs up the sentiment with strangely
    mechanical sounds that seem to have been created by processing recorded drum
    hits-- the bassline is crazy and intensely melodic, and they use the same vocal phrase
    about five different ways over all manner of instrumentation, including a heavy baritone sax riff and an fluidly ascendant, synth-saturated buildup. 
    </p>
<p>
    Once you've listened through a couple of times, it's stunning
    how many clever and exciting moments stick with you-- music this full of ideas,
    sections and material can come across as overstuffed, but this feels just
    right almost everywhere. Their previous two albums worked because of their
    stripped, immediate simplicity; <em>Friend and Foe</em> works just as well moving away from that
    approach and shows dimensions of the band-- especially in the vocal
    department-- that weren't apparent before. In fact, the biggest concern one
    might come away from <em>Friend and Foe</em>
    with is whether the band can top it next time.

    David Vandervelde is a 22-year-old Chicagoan who's managed to find himself in the full throes of T.Rextasy. On <em>The Moonstation House Band</em>, his mini-album debut, he's mastered all the moves-- not just Marc Bolan's cock-of-the-walk riffs, but also his excitable delivery, which, like everything else here, is drenched in dreamy reverb. Vandervelde uses the orchestral grandiloquence of David Bowie and Roxy Music as a springboard for his own spacey sonic experiments, all developed and recorded at Jay Bennett's Pieholden Suite Sound Studio. Oh, and he played all the instruments on the album-- even taught himself the ones he didn't know.</p><p>
    While putting everything together, he guested on albums by Bennett, Mark Eitzel, and Johnathan Rice, and he's got the chops and audacity to make both the Stones' ""Cocksucker Blues"" and his own ""Fuckin' Around"" live staples. But while his ambitions are no doubt enormous, they sometimes get the better of him on this distinctive, but not quite consistent, debut.</p><p>
    Musically, the touchstones are obvious, but Vandervelde tweaks them to fit his own needs. Opener ""Nothin' No"" builds a slow-moving sitar groove atop spastic drumming, and on ""Wisdom From a Tree"" droning piano twines around weightless strings to create a perfect showcase for his impressive glam falsetto. When the tempos slow, though, the production sounds busy and boisterous: The hooks fail to catch hold, the riffs don't churn quite enough momentum, and the songs settle like silt. It doesn't help that Vandervelde follows the album-opening one-two punch of ""Nothin' No"" and ""Jacket"" with back-to-back downbeat numbers, killing the momentum. Elsewhere, ""Feet of a Liar"" drowns its melody into too many spacey effects, while ""Corduroy Blues"" and the closer ""Moonlight Instrumental""-- both featuring string arrangements from composer David Campbell (responsible for the <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> score and siring Beck)-- sound impressively large but aimless.
    </p>
<p>
    If Vandervelde builds from a classic rock blueprint, his lyrics sound wholly contemporary, sporting a strong impressionistic touch and attention to narrative details. ""Nothin' No"" (which, as you've probably already determined, is the standout) recounts summer nights spent getting high and drunk on the front porch, macking on someone else's girl: ""When your mother showed up to see you, you poured the drinks under the deck,"" Vandervelde sings. ""And when your boyfriend drove to meet you, you covered the bruises on your neck""-- two lines that effortlessly sum up just about everyone's 20th summer.
    </p>
<p>
    Vendervelde's songs work best when they're most specific and when his cocksure performance balances his own experiences with rock-star projection. Sporting the album's most momentous hook, ""Can't See Your Face No More"" laments being dumped for another guy (namely Jesus Christ), and ""Jacket"" never specifies the meaning of a girl's forgotten coat, only hinting lasciviously at the consequences. On the other hand, the misbegotten ""Murder in Michigan"" is utterly beyond him: Vandervelde can't muster the gravity to make lines like ""Black-eyed Suzanne submissive and kind/ Nocturnal mistress with me in my mind"" sound convincingly life-or-death, so the song reads like a basic fiction-workshop exercise.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, any artist who can endure such a sustained comparison to glam icons without coming off like a blowhard is doing something right. Vandervelde has obviously studied long and hard, learning what makes each of his heroes sound so distinctive. But perhaps his most crucial trait-- one which can't be taught but can certainly be honed-- is the precocious self-confidence that allows him to live out his rock 'n' roll fantasy while singing in his own voice.

    Dark Meat's debut album, <em>Universal
    Indians</em>, begins quietly, with the lone voice of Page Campbell singing an a
    capella intro with a distinctly pastoral lilt. Just when your ears have become
    accustomed to her folksy mellifluousness, ""Freedom Ritual"" explodes in a rapture of sound, as approximately two-thirds of the population of Athens,
    Georgia, come in all at
    once. Or at least that's how it sounds. Dark Meat is a Southern rock (or
    Southern-rock) collective headed by Jim McHugh and spiritually guided by free-jazz
    saxophonist Albert Ayler, and <em>Universal
    Indians</em> features nearly 30 musicians seemingly playing at the same time.</p><p>
    These sprawling songs hang together loosely, dense and busy
    with different textures, which are caked on in thick brushstrokes to sound
    large and layered: Jeff Tobias and Alexis Daglis' saxophones squall through ""Assholes
    for Eyeballs"", adding a grainy dissonance, while the marching-band brass make ""One
    More Trip"" sound like the coolest field show ever. ""Angel of Meth"" features
    girl-group harmonies and ""Be My Baby"" drums. Descending guitar riffs fall
    through ""Dead Man"" and ""In the Woods""; choirs of backing vocals echo the
    choruses, punctuating McHugh's drunken vocals with Stonesy staccato ooh-oohs;
    gospel cries occasionally pierce the din. Ambient interludes ""Birdsong +
    Footsteps, Flute, Horn"" and ""Disintegrating Flowers"" betray a hippie party
    vibe, offset by the children chanting and giggling through ""Well Fuck You
    Then"".</p><p>
    At times Dark Meat lumber along, as
    if cramped by the tiny compact disc that holds them all like General Zod, but
    the loose rhythm section-- at least four strong-- keeps the band surprisingly
    agile, laying down classic-rock thunder and r&amp;b boogie with equal bravado. As
    a result, even when the songs descend into a mire of controlled cacophony-- and
    almost all of them do-- the band can easily and gradually rebuild the rhythms
    and melodies element by element. If it becomes a predictable tack, it's no less
    effective for being repetitive.
    </p>
<p>
    At the center of this maelstrom is McHugh himself, the
    ringleader and chief songwriter. Not only does he demonstrate résumé-quality
    personnel management skills, but his lyrics-- whether conjuring a dead friend,
    detailing an arduous spiritual journey, or just flipping the bird to anyone in
    earshot-- walk the line between angry and hopeful, fearful and fantastical. As
    a singer, he sounds emboldened by the crowd behind him, as if drunk on their
    company. <em>Universal Indians</em> would be
    interesting only for the logistics of the undertaking-- I imagine shows where
    the distinctions between performer and audience is blurred completely-- but the
    group's communal excitement make <em>Universal
    Indians</em> a fascinating feat, surprisingly accessible and rewarding.

Even without a firm grasp on this elaborate plotline, however, listeners should still be able to find abundant drama within the Orchestra's inventive stylings. Drawing upon big-band traditions-- think Quincy Jones or late-period Ellington as well as the Sun Ra Arkestra-- the expanded Orchestra serves to frame one of Mazurek's most exuberant and ambitious works to date.</p><p>
    For the album, Mazurek has gathered a top-notch roster of veteran Chicago musicians and improvisers, including flutist Nicole Mitchell, pianist Jim Baker, and Tortoise's John McEntire, Jeff Parker, and John Herndon. [<em>Full disclosure: Among the other players is drummer Mike Reed, who books and manages the Pitchfork Music Festival-- Ed.</em>] The set-up here typically employs two basses, two drummers, two mallets, ARP synthesizer, and multiple brass instruments and reeds. Composed and developed over the course of a dozen international performances, the album was ultimately recorded by McEntire at his Soma Studios, and reveals several of his distinctive post-production fingerprints. And though much on the album is improvised-- or at least appears to be-- there is little focus given to extensive soloing or even necessarily to individual performances.</p><p>
    The album is divided into three distinct sections, each of which takes cues from organic sound recordings related to Mazurek's nebulous storyline. On the mesmerizing ""Psycho-Tropic Electric Eel Dream"", part of the album's opening four-song suite ""Sting Ray and the Beginning of Time"", the orchestra improvises upon tapes of electric eels recorded by Mazurek at a research laboratory in Brazil. Although unless you've got keen ears and a degree in marine biology you'll probably just have to take their word for it. Elsewhere on this evocative suite the group schools together at high velocity, their spirited vamps elevated in particular by Jeb Bishop's trombone and Corey Wilkes' flugelhorn, while Mitchell's exotic flute can lend the proceedings a brightened, almost Henry Mancini-like seabreeze.
    </p><p>
    Even more impressive is the album's second extended song suite, the five-part ""Cosmic Tomes for Sleep-Walking Lovers"". Opening with a doctored recording of an Amazon rainstorm, the piece's first section bursts quickly into an ecstatic full-group improvisation, with Mazurek's central cornet buffeted by squalls from every direction. These disparate voices then converge with dazzling precision on the piece's second section, with McEntire deftly sculpting the music's layered, pointillist harmonic patterns.
    </p>
<p>
    Following the brief segue ""15 Ways Towards a Finite Universe"", Mitchell's flute leads <em>We Are All From Somewhere Else</em> to a dreamy landing, cushioned by Matt Bauder's luxurious bass clarinet and languid flourishes of Martin Denny exotica. By this point, if you've been following along with Mazurek's text, the eels and sting rays have all apparently been transformed into flying birds and eventually into burning, new-born stars. And though its unlikely that there's anything in this predominantly instrumental music that'll actually clue you in to these fine points, the Exploding Star Orchestra have provided enough space to allow the imagination to begin filling in the details.

    I can't tell you up front that <em>There to Here</em> is of any interest to
    anyone who isn't already a Fugazi fan. I <em>can</em> tell you that this isn't
    just Fugazi bassist Joe Lally, but Joe Lally and Friends, including most of
    Fugazi, Amy Farina from the Evens, and drummer Jason Kourkounis, to name a few.
    That means there is some Evens-esque low-volume pop like ""The
    Resigned"" and some funk workouts like the title track where it's hard to
    believe it's not Brendan Canty on drums (he is conspicuously absent here). It
    also means that if you love Fugazi so much that you loved the <em>Instrument</em>
    soundtrack, there are at least one or two tracks to satiate your desire for
    that rubbery legato punk-funk.</p><p>
    However, ""minimal"" doesn't even begin to cover the feel of <em>There
    to Here</em>. Ascetic is more like it. This is music allergic to anything but
    Joe Lally's modest, sincere voice, the fluid thumbing of bass strings, and the
    occasional drum accompaniment. When friends stop by to contribute a few scraps
    of melody, they're often the highlights of the album. ""The Resigned""
    adds backing vocals from both Ian MacKaye and Amy Farina of the Evens to its
    strutting groove, the bass in ""Billiards"" makes room for a few blues
    licks, and the title track makes great use of incidental guitar noise, sounding
    far less claustrophobic than the rest of the record.</p><p>
    When it's just Lally solo or he and a drummer, there's a hymn-like
    simplicity to tracks like ""X-Ray the Lullaby"" or ""Message From
    Earth"". The spoken word track ""Sons and Daughters"" has some
    painful and awkward lines that make a minute feel like an hour just to deliver
    the punchline, though it lands: ""We say 'Us' when we really mean our sons
    and daughters."" ""Sons and Daughters"" isn't even crippled by
    Lally's delivery, as he works around the blandness of his voice, here and on
    the rest of the record, with a delivery that further illustrates his knack for
    rhythm. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's the content of the lyrics, or rather their crushing earnestness, that
    really sinks it. ""The Resigned"" and ""Sons and Daughters""
    being the few tracks with any artistic conceit in their lyrics, most being like
    ""Pick a War"", with straightforward and uninsightful protest just for the
    sake of it. Fugazi's monstrous success can be attributed in part to lyrical
    ambiguity, with messages that can be taken personally or politically; that's
    not the case here. <em>There to Here</em> is an effective record, but only for a
    specific audience of simple-groove-digging, minimal-arrangement-tolerating,
    far-left-leaning, and punk-loving music fanatics. Which doesn't <em>necessarily</em>
    make you a Fugazi fan...

    guitarist played with PSF legends White Heaven, helped Damon &amp; Naomi
    reach an apex, and continues shredding in Ghost. So, basically, the collection finds a few of Japan's most
    consistently face-melting, soul-stirring artists intersecting. They
    land near the late 1960s then continue onward, radiating a dusky
    Siltbreeze sound, Kurihara expanding  Boris' reach
    with his gauzy, moody, fretwork.</p><p>
<em>
    Pink</em>'s just about always described as a rock'n'roll album (see above), but despite the critical frame, a certain strain of Jesu and Ride fans pointed
    toward the opener, ""Farewell"", as the album's sublime apex.  If you're
    in that hanky-holding camp, <em>Rainbow</em> should be a treat: It not only
    revisits that shoegaze moment, but also includes lounge weirdness, toy-box balladry, and moody, stringed pyrotechnics.
    Throughout, the addition of Kurihara staggers: Opener ""Rafflesia""
    takes what ""Farewell"" did so well, but pushes it even further,
    Kurihara managing to nail stars with hypnotic
    tone-benders.</p><p>
    There are other new sounds: Guitarist Wata handles vocals on the slinky title
    track.  ""Starship
    Narrator"" takes off <em>Siamese Dream</em>-style, locating a bluesy guitar
    scorch before it dries out amid a flood of Can-loving amplifier
    worship. Continuing the haze in a gentler realm, a Loren Connors-esque
    guitar unwinds to full flutter on the moving, all too brief ""My
    Rain"", with tape-noise lapping up the dampness in the background.
    </p><p>
    The closest we come to Ghost's fathomless psych-folk is ""Shine"", its
    troubadour rattle eventually blooming into a somber, echo-chambered sound. There's a depth to the production here that's quite different from the
    upfront immediacy of <em>Pink</em>. Helping slightly to warm the vibe, ""You
    Laughed Like a Water Mark"" seduces downcast, stoner-friendly, monotone
    psychedelic rock: Kurihara's guitar steamrolls as the song continues
    its seven minutes, ending in a flurry, even as the rest of the band maintains a consistent doze. The hazy ""Fuzzy Reactor"" would've made an excellent finale: With its
    unidentified wind source and backward tape, it sounds like a retreat.
    </p>
<p>
    Inevitably, Boris keep pushing: ""Sweet No. 1"" closes this quiet-is-the-new-loud ramble with a rock
    dervish. It starts slow (much of it feels more like a strum exercise)
    before a stutter-step guitar strut. But this isn't
    Comets on Fire: It's burnt, damp, and saturated.  Thing is,
    it also seems a bit unnecessary. And it's a solid track-- don't
    misunderstand-- but it comes across like a party crasher, drowning out the
    slow-release of what came before, only to return to the quiet toy-box
    mini-orchestra outro, ""...And, I Want"".
    </p>
<p>
    Sick of Boris? It's easy to feel worn out amid the big-time
    magazine features, hectic release schedule, and endless touring
    (and, well, seemingly endless live sets-- sorry folks)? I was almost at the
    end of my own Boris rope, but <em>Rainbow</em> gave me
    a jolt, sounding a lot like something that would've set up camp on my
    turntable a dozen years ago when I memorized those Forced Exposure
    catalogues. It's vintage and totally invigorating. The immediate <em>Pink</em>
    punk-slap isn't here, but where the former nails one hue and keeps
    running with it, I can imagine this new, deeper set keeping me cozy for years to come. It's already eerily familiar.

    Getting the band back together is not a good idea.
    Late-career reunion albums long ago passed into the realm of Really Bad Idea,
    right up there with Jäger shots on New Year's. The past few years have seen
    serious stumbles from the Who, the Zombies, and Big Star, to name just a few of
    many dud attempts to revive the cult or popular brand and reclaim a little
    glory. The consistency with which these albums tarnish instead of burnish a
    band's legacy doesn't bode well for the Stooges, who've recently reformed for
    their first album since 1973. But what if a band has only a dubious body of
    work to its name, instead of a vault of beloved recordings? That's another
    story. The cameo-heavy<em> Here &amp; Now</em>,
    America's first album in almost a decade, turns out to be... wait for it... a
    little better than expected.</p><p>
    It would have to be. In the early 1970s, the band had a
    brief moment in the sun with hits like ""Sister Golden Hair"" and ""A Horse with
    No Name"", lo-cal SoCal ditties that cribbed from Neil Young and inexplicably continue
    to haunt oldies playlists. They have an easy way with hooks and harmonies that
    must've sounded better 30 years ago, and their arduous touring schedule (they're
    constantly on the road) proves Dewey Bunnell and Gerry Beckley
    still have their share of fans. What they don't have, however, is a <em>Raw Power</em> or a <em>Meaty Beaty Big &amp; Bouncy</em> or a <em>#1 Record</em> to compare against new material; they've only got a decent-selling
    <em>Greatest Hits</em> package and a handful
    of breezy light-rock oldies, most of which sound dated even on the recently
    recorded live disc that accompanies <em>Here
    &amp; Now</em>.</p><p>
    Mind you, all the elements that make America
    so exasperating are here in droves. The melodies are unobtrusive, the hooks
    lack impact, and the harmonies sound distinctively soft-focus. The who's-who of
    indie-friendly musicians can't even liven things up: The gauzy production by
    Smashing Pumpkin James Iha and Fountain of Wayne Adam Schlesinger makes most of
    these songs sound indistinguishable, and Ryan Adams can't rescue the
    cliché-ridden ""Ride On"". Lyrics have never been America's
    forte, and while there's nothing to rival the classic line ""The heat was hot""
    from ""A Horse with No Name"", <em>Here &amp;
    Now</em> is riddled with groaners. Beckley and Bunnell still favor songs about
    how dreams are important (""Chasing the Rainbow""), love can be scary but rewarding
    (""One Chance""), and life is a hard road you have to travel (just about every
    other song). To borrow Joe Tangari's comparison, America
    are the Ed Wood of lyrics, and <em>Here &amp;
    Now</em> is their<em> Bride of the Monster</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    So, how is <em>Here &amp;
    Now</em> better than expected, besides not being ""Muskrat Love""? Well, first
    there's the cover of My Morning Jacket's ""Golden"", featuring real live members
    of My Morning Jacket. (They pull the same trick with Nada Surf's ""Always Love"".) Removing the song from Jim James' reverb atmosphere and
    retrofitting it to a peaceful easy feeling might sound like a recipe for
    disaster, but Beckley and Bunnell are
    able to expand the original, subtly shading its meaning. Singing ""Golden"" at
    the end of a career, especially one that isn't as storied as those of America's
    contemporaries, deepens the song's sense of longing and makes its central
    question-- is it all worth it?-- sound all the more profound. More than just being
    the most recognizable song to indie listeners, ""Golden"" is the highlight of
    <em>Here &amp; Now</em> because it's one of the few times that Bunnell and Beckley
    manage to say something substantial in a way that doesn't make you want to
    switch off your iPod.
    </p>
<p>
    Second, <em>Here &amp; Now</em>
    is so modest that it's hard to muster any serious indignation over its flaws.
    It's nice-guy rock, a little disarming in its queasy sentimentality but
    ultimately harmless. In fact, the album's true strength is its forgettability: It won't make you reconsider their earlier material, which is a big plus, and
    it doesn't ask you to remember many of these new songs once they're over.

    The Aquarium's self-titled debut starts with an entrancing one-two punch.
    Opener ""Maxxo Sesh"" weaves Jason Hutto's rippling keyboards and Laura
    Harris's bouncing drums into a proggy web. Having drifted out to sea, the duo
    lay back and stare at the sun on ""Can't Afford to Live Here"", a
    bittersweet ode to cohabitation that feels like a shoegazed take on the Beach
    Boys' ""Wouldn't It Be Nice?""</p><p>
    The rest of the album isn't quite so dreamy. But as the Aquarium widens its
    palette to include frantic pop, heavy rock, and circus-like tunes, the hypnosis
    of those opening tracks persists. Hutto coaxes winding melodies from his keys,
    while Harris's beats animate the songs like adrenaline filling veins. On the
    surface, the group's chugging sound recalls early Quasi. But a breeziness also
    suggests the wistful retro-pop of the Rosebuds, and raw hooks evoke New Zealand
    pioneers like the Clean and the Bats.</p><p>
    All of which makes it a surprise that that this album is on Dischord. The
    legendary D.C. punk label has certainly broadened in recent years. But compared
    to more adventurous peers, its punk-based roster is still narrow, and you'd be
    hard-pressed to find anything this poppy and fun among Dischord's ""records
    and stuff we sell."" Give Ian MacKaye and company credit, then, for making <em>The
    Aquarium</em> the label's biggest curveball to date.
    </p>
<p>
    The key here is Hutto's keyboard playing. Unafraid of cheesy sounds or
    sugary melodies, he relies on energy and dynamics to breathe new life into old
    ideas. On ""White House"", he flies through ELP-style prog up into the
    helium-filled realm of Europe circa ""The Final Countdown"", but the
    track's urgency obliterates pretensions. ""Credits"" crafts a looping
    line from generic mall-store organ, and ""Channel 9"" sounds like
    a high-speed version of the ""Munsters"" theme. Somehow, the duo's vigor turns all of
    this into something unique.
    </p>
<p>
    It helps that the Aquarium's songwriting is so solid. The melodies here are
    instantly memorable, yet unpredictably paced. Tracks like ""Through the
    Tunnel"" and ""Good People"" dole out momentum shifts and chord
    changes in brain-sticking ways. The intensely hooky ""Waiting for the
    Girl"" even takes the catchiness too far; you might end up annoyed by how
    hard it is to erase the track's vocal melody from memory.
    </p>
<p>
    Hutto and Harris close with ""Aquarium Dream"", a spacey, cinematic
    instrumental that would fit well with the movie clips the pair used to project
    at gigs. Like many of the tracks here, it has a reflective, nostalgic feel. But
    the way Hutto and Harris inject their soaring music with rough chords and
    swinging pulse plants <em>The Aquarium</em> squarely in the here and now.

Although Miller's folk is genuinely freaky, he apparently doesn't feel compelled to advertise it by making up a weird name for himself, like ""Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice,"" ""Holopaw,"" or ""Devendra Banhart."" He doesn't dress like an H&amp;M model from the Ozarks. He doesn't even decorate his album cover with copulating unicorns or hand-drawn paisley: Instead, it's an unexceptional shot of Miller looking pensive in green silhouette. On the surface, the freakiest thing about this album is its terrible title. Besides that, Miller is 19 years old. I don't know anything about him, nor do I want to-- the music speaks for itself without any persona to bolster it.</p><p>
    This isn't the end of the misdirection this album seems to revel in-- the first track, ""Sinners"", is a red herring, nothing like the ensuing songs. Miller counts off a frayed acoustic strum and launches into a bloozy belt, pierced with falsetto harmonies. I actually enjoy ""Sinners"", with its overstated raucousness and sharp imagery (i.e., when Miller takes a bow and shoots a pair of giant glowing eyes out of the sky), but a whole album of it would have worn thin quickly. Happily, only one other song uses this format, and it's a winner as well: The bongo-blues of ""Mr. Green"" is mean and violently shucking, wrapping its clattering core in a tangle of handclaps, exhortative ad libs, yowling tomcat embellishments and monochromatic harmonies. Here's to small doses.</p><p>
    Miller owes a clear debt to early Banhart, with his murky arrangements, overlapping falsettos, and sinister little slides into a nasal vibrato; he's also beholden to Iron &amp; Wine's <em>The Creek Drank the Cradle</em>, with his fondness for double-tracked high/low vocals. Since both of these artists have moved on to bigger and ostensibly better things, it's a pleasure to revisit their humble home-recording days by proxy: the omnipresent tape hiss, the found sounds, the collaged vocals, the oceanic ebb and flow. The murmuring ""International"" stands in stark contrast to ""Sinners""-- the quavering harmonies sound submerged, as do the flecks of guitar, glinting distantly like coins in a pond. The melody is alluringly shapeless, swirling mysteriously over percolating hand percussion.
    </p><p>
    Blake's at his best when exploring loose structures and leavening them with unexpected sounds: The typewriter clacks, plaintive sour notes, and noisy harmonica blares of ""Summer She's Hiding""; the deliriously sawing violins on the cloudy chamber dirge ""Mama Papa Witch Daddy""; the bleating horns and ratcheting mouth percussion of ""Like Birds Pouring Out My Sides"". Green turns out to be a very appropriate color for the cover of <em>Together with Cats</em>, given the music's eerie, sub-aquatic eldritch glow, and the jealousy it'll inspire in less naturally gifted young musicians. I'm reminded that the idiom we call freak-folk tends to work best at its most rudimentary, and that the old axiom about books and covers extends to albums as well.

While that may sound nuanced to the uninitiated, the details were often swallowed by scads of swirling, processed guitar that the band's influences necessitated, somewhere between the overly-cited-yet-with-good-reason My Bloody Valentine and Hawkwind.  But whether by necessity, as these tracks were collected from vinyl-only EPs, or just the hesitant steps of an unproven band, the structure of the songs on <em>Early Violence </em>are far more predictable than the abrupt switches between the extremes of their debut. Whether you found those changes artful or indulgent, <em>Early Violence</em> at least offers us a different approach.</p><p>
    ""Vice"" showcases the same attention to detail as the best moments of <em>Dins</em>, with a far-off Farfisa offering a countermelody to the song's trembling, murky groove. Follower ""Killer"" uses more electronic tones than anything on the band's debut, and while the guitars are mine the same shoegazer sound, the drum machine spits and seethes under a repetitive, mechanical bass line and a burping 8-bit keyboard.</p><p>
    Things grow tired quickly, however, as""Diamond City"" is a meandering blues vamp without a trace of originality, and ""Days"" covers similarly well-tread ground despite an otherwise promising minor-key drone. (Hidden track ""Diamond City Redux"" is somewhat rougher in recording quality, has some vocals, and isn't any more essential.) ""Highway of Death"" makes very creative use of the volume knob. ""4AM"" returns to a more mechanical, almost industrial throb, and it occurs to me that these tracks hit me harder because I'm starved for texture-- something I'd never say of <em>Dins</em>. ""Red-Split"" is a step in the right direction, led by a stately yet siren-like keyboard drone that sounds vintage and alien all at once. The fact the guitars lay back, adding a few bent notes for atmosphere, gives it the subtle uneasiness of a John Carpenter score and is memorable just for its contrast with the rest of the compilation. These scant eight tracks do nothing to change the enormous promise Psychic Ills showed on their debut; <em>Early Violence</em> just shows a lot less of it.

Happily, Dust-to-Digital's output is just as good at highlighting the roots of modern music (see 2001's expansive collection of secular songs, <i>Goodbye, Babylon</i>) as it is at exposing genres, trends, and sounds that didn't make it long past 1945: <i>How Low Can You Go?</i>, a rollicking coming-of-age story for the string bass, and <i>I Belong to This Band</i>, 85 years worth of shape-note performances, make no real attempt at explaining away the subsequent marginalization of their respective jams. But they do manage to celebrate all the strange, cumbersome, and preposterous traditions born from American soil.</p>
<p><i>I Belong to This Band: 85 Years of Sacred Harp Recordings</i> follows the practice of shape-note singing from 1922 through to the present (although most of the songs here are actually much older), offering 30 distinct cuts, spanning a mess of geographies, years, and intentions. Shape-note singing, a church-based southern song system based in four notes (sung as fa, sol, la, and mi), was initially designed as an all-inclusive, participatory choral tradition-- it's not necessary to know how to read music to sing shape notes, most songs are transposed a capella, and each piece is specifically engineered for swarms of singers, meaning the whole always trumps the parts. Although there are several shape note songbooks, <i>The Sacred Harp</i> is the most celebrated collection (published in 1844, by Benjamin Franklin Wright and Elisha J. King, it contains over 250 songs), and somewhere along the way, it became the movement's lone manifesto and remains tucked under the pillows of dedicated shape-note singers everywhere-- appropriately, each track included here was born from <i>The Sacred Harp</i>.</p>
<p>Maybe the very best thing about shape-note singing is the croaky, full-body hollers the form demands; because the end result is one voice, shape-note singers don't worry so much about tone and pitch, bellowing and shouting with big, unabashed confidence. <i>I Belong to This Band</i> coughs up some appropriately stellar performances: in 1960, S. Whitt Denson decided to perform ""New Morning Sun"", a shape-note song written by his father, S.M. Denson, nearly 50 years earlier. Whitt sings each part separately and layers the vocals back together, creating what he dubbed ""a one-voice quartette""-- the result is joyful and otherworldly, full of weird, perfect harmonies. ""Cuba"", sung by the Alabama Sacred Harp singers on October 29, 1928 is a solid example of classic shape-note harmony, with each voice somehow both distinct and perfectly blended, while ""Save, Lord, or We Perish"", performed at the Henagar-Union Convention on July 2, 2006, proves that expert shape noting has hardly disappeared.</p>
<p>The tracks here aren't arranged chronologically, which, theoretically, seems counterintuitive-- but when all that's involved is the human voice, it becomes instantly evident that the noises we make when we open our mouths and bellow don't change all that much, whether it's 1928 or 2006. This isn't the only collection of its type-- see also Alan Lomax's <i>Southern Journey Volumes 9 and 10: Harp of 1000 Strings</i>, or <i>Religion is a Fortune: Sacred Harp Singing</i>-- but it is the first to so seamlessly reveal the hopeless continuity of the human voice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <i>How Low Can You Go?</i> celebrates the player Eddie Dean dubs ""the man in the middle, the humble workman with bloodied hands and nary a nod from the crowd,"" the ever-overlooked bassist: The first collection devoted solely to the giant, awkward string bass, <i>How Low Can You Go?</i> is a mind-blowing assemblage of bass-centric (and mostly jazz) tracks from 1925-1941. With three discs (the first two were recorded predominantly in New York City, the third in Chicago) and an impressive book of liner notes (sections are subtitled with phrases like ""Basses vs. Tubas, Tubas Lose""), <i>How Low Can You Go?</i> is both impossibly informative and stupidly fun. Featuring tracks from the Harlem Hot Shots, Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies, Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, Cab Calloway, Jelly Roll Morton, Jimmie Rodgers, Duke Ellington, the Midnight Rounders, and plenty more, <i>How Low Can You Go?</i> starts out as a compelling historical document, then promptly devolves into the party soundtrack you've always craved: raucous, bouncy, and mostly unstoppable. Spin Jelly Roll Morton's ""Black Bottom Stomp"" or Walter Page and his Original Blue Devils' ""Squabblin'"" and see how long you can stand still.</p>
<p>Dust-to-Digital may not be expecting to land a hot new track on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" but the label is still pumping out some of the most vital and exciting contemporary releases: When you're exhausted by standard guitar-synth-drums get-ups, check their warehouse, and prepare to move.</p></div>"|11894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11894-how-low-can-you-go-i-belong-to-this-band/|9.0|Amanda Petrusich

<p>Meanwhile, <i>How Low Can You Go?</i> celebrates the player Eddie Dean dubs ""the man in the middle, the humble workman with bloodied hands and nary a nod from the crowd,"" the ever-overlooked bassist: The first collection devoted solely to the giant, awkward string bass, <i>How Low Can You Go?</i> is a mind-blowing assemblage of bass-centric (and mostly jazz) tracks from 1925-1941. With three discs (the first two were recorded predominantly in New York City, the third in Chicago) and an impressive book of liner notes (sections are subtitled with phrases like ""Basses vs. Tubas, Tubas Lose""), <i>How Low Can You Go?</i> is both impossibly informative and stupidly fun. Featuring tracks from the Harlem Hot Shots, Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies, Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, Cab Calloway, Jelly Roll Morton, Jimmie Rodgers, Duke Ellington, the Midnight Rounders, and plenty more, <i>How Low Can You Go?</i> starts out as a compelling historical document, then promptly devolves into the party soundtrack you've always craved: raucous, bouncy, and mostly unstoppable. Spin Jelly Roll Morton's ""Black Bottom Stomp"" or Walter Page and his Original Blue Devils' ""Squabblin'"" and see how long you can stand still.</p>
<p>Dust-to-Digital may not be expecting to land a hot new track on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" but the label is still pumping out some of the most vital and exciting contemporary releases: When you're exhausted by standard guitar-synth-drums get-ups, check their warehouse, and prepare to move.</p></div>"|11894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11894-how-low-can-you-go-i-belong-to-this-band/|8.5|Amanda Petrusich

    bit of a slump lately. Patron saints Flaming Lips' 2006 outing, <em>At War With the Mystics</em>, couldn't muster up memorable melodies to
    match its playful production. Mercury Rev's 2005 <em>The Secret Migration</em>
    wouldn't even be mind-expanding in a Cold Stone Creamery. A new
    Polyphonic Spree record has been so long coming they named last year's
    stopgap EP <em>Wait</em>. Who knows, maybe what Nancy Reagan told us about acid
    was true.</p><p>
    Well, except for the hokum about it messing up your DNA. The Earlies put
    their zany forebears' genetic blueprints to fine use on <em>These Were the
    Earlies</em>, the 2004 debut by the half-Manchester, half-Texas quartet.
    Culled from five previous EPs, that album found the transcontinental
    group seeking a home in the frontier between two headphones, with
    strings, synths, woodwinds, and marching-band brass. If their debut
    explored the space within, the Earlies' latest, <em>The Enemy Chorus</em>,
    peers into the void of the final frontier, with a similar kitchen-sink
    approach and more of the krautrock sprawl that characterized early
    singles like ""Morning Wonder"".</p><p>
    The deaths and lies of the last couple of years must've gotten to
    these dudes, too. Opener and first single ""No Love in Your Heart""
    builds from lockstep motorik groove to a swirl of meandering
    harmonies, chanting, strings, and clattering percussion. Panning
    effects overtake theatrical pianos on the subsequent ""Burn the Liars"",
    which finds lead singer Brandon Carr complaining, ""Don't tell me
    life's OK/ I tell myself that."" On title track ""Enemy Chorus"", an
    Eastern-tinged melody snakes around a minimalist drone as the
    protagonist crawls past enemy lines. A bright, flange-dappled bridge
    cuts through the gloom: ""Tell me it's gonna get better.""
    </p><p>
    The cover design, by Manchester-based artist Michael England,
    certainly suggests a futuristic enclave of joy and light amid a dark,
    bleak universe. With prominent horns and a <em>Moon Safari</em> string
    arrangement, ""Foundation and Earth"" opens the album's second side
    finding the <em>Midnite Vultures</em> sunshine funk in ""day after day."" The
    catchiest track, ""When the Wind Blows"", casts a sing-songy melody over
    stomping drums and piano, shifting into a ""Hey Jude""-informed chorus.
    Harmonicas wheeze on ""Bad Is as Bad Does"", atop backwards cymbals.
    When they work, these ambitious arrangements plausibly act out the
    cover art.
    </p>
<p>
    At other times, the Earlies' seriousness casts a shadow over their
    sonic fireworks. ""If the light goes out/ The world will be dark
    again,"" Carr murmurs on sappy ""The Ground We Walk On"", slide guitar
    mired in acoustic-Braffrock arpeggios. Muted pianos and a ""Revolution 9"" collage of astronaut audio (Jets to Brazil did this better on
    ""Perfecting Loneliness"") introduce ""Little Trooper"", a somber track
    that wouldn't be out of place as a too-pristine Dream Theater ballad.
    </p>
<p>
    Remember the Beta Band who, like the Earlies, launched their career
    with a record compiling early EPs. The Scottish quartet coolly
    contradicted the idea a good song is one you can rehash on ""MTV
    Unplugged"", instead focusing on the production and frills that would
    make a perfect track. The Earlies' take a similar approach, but at
    times lose their focus as the Beta Band seemed to on later
    albums. The best moments here are the instrumentals: sitar-driven
    krautrock space raga ""The Breaking Point"" and bassoon-heavy galactic
    war anthem ""Gone for the Most Part"". Our long national nightmare isn't
    quite over, but the Earlies can at least make it brighter-- and they
    don't need words to do it.

He's one
    of a handful of truly iconic film composers, immediately recognizable
    to fans across the musical spectrum, from jazz to rock to classical.
    And yet, somehow Morricone has never won an Academy Award. No matter
    how much weight you accord the Oscars, that's an insult, but
    Morricone's taken his numerous slights and losses with good humor. In
    a 2001 interview with <em>The Guardian</em>, Morricone quipped
    (via translator), ""If it was up to me, I'd win an Oscar every two
    years!"" With the Academy no doubt hedging its bets, at 78 he'll
    receive a consolation prize this year-- an honorary
    lifetime achievement Oscar, mere weeks after he makes his U.S. live
    conducting debut.</p><p>
    While Morricone-philes continue to unearth unheard or forgotten scores
    from the legendary Italian composer, musical archaeologists have been discovering, digging up, and dusting off a
    relatively obscure period in Morricone's career, a stint spent in the
    improvisational 1960s collective Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova
    Consonanza, whose experiments with <em>musique concrète</em>
    informed Morricone's scores.</p><p>
    Composition is just very slow improvisation, goes the saying, so maybe
    it's no surprise to hear so many parallels to Morricone's often
    wonderfully strange film works in <em>Azioni</em>, a 2xCD/DVD
    collection. At the same time, while Morricone may be the most famous
    alumni of Il Gruppo, he's not necessarily the most important. Indeed,
    he's just one of several prominent, talented voices dedicated to
    deconstructing themselves and diving into dissonance, among them  (at
    least for these 1967-1969 sessions) Mario Bertoncini, Walter Branchi,
    founder Franco Evangelisti, John Heineman, Roland Kayn, Egisto Macchi,
    and Ivan Vandor.
    </p><p>
    In the companion DVD-- which features interviews and invaluable
    footage from a 1967 performance in Rome-- Evangelisti is asked how
    audiences react to the group. He responds, ""Some are shocked, some
    others pleased, and some even think that we can't play the
    instruments."" That the same reaction has been provoked by everyone
    from obvious predecessors like John Cage to Il Gruppo's later
    contemporaries in AAM through such heavily, proudly indebted followers
    as John Zorn really says it all.
    </p>
<p>
    But watching Il Gruppo, say, huddled over a piano, pulling and
    scraping at its strings is a bit like reading spoilers before seeing a
    movie, so better to dive into the previously unreleased music first,
    while it all remains a sonic mystery. At any given time over the
    course of the two generous discs it's impossible to tell just how many
    hands are at work, let alone what they're up to. What's remarkable is
    that amidst all the action it's generally easy to hear different
    voices. Bowed metal, bird calls, breathy trumpet bleats
    (courtesy Morricone), and plodding pianos are among the more
    recognizable of the sometimes whimsical, often spooky sounds, yet
    there's clearly a method to the madness.
    </p>
<p>
    Evangelisti (who died in 1980) called Il Gruppo ""the first group
    in the world made up totally of composers,"" but that could be said of
    virtually any improvisational group. Still, this is an act whose members know better than to step on one
    another's toes. There's space in the racket, pauses to allow the
    sounds to sink in, or maybe to grant the members a chance to imagine
    what comes next. They're clearly thinking on their feet, aided only by
    their eyes and ears. Maybe that's why their music remains just as
    challenging and enthralling today as it must have been
    at its inception.
    </p>
<p>
    Il Gruppo remained active throughout the 70s-- Morricone ""conducted""
    them for his score to 1971's <em>Gli Occhi Freddi Della Paura</em>, and the
    similarly unearthed <em>Musica Su Schemi</em> captures a performance from 1976-- but it was during this exciting late-60s period that the group was
    really onto something, unleashing their music Ids and heading into
    parts unknown.

    Much like its namesake war, Vietnam the band was not a good time. Upon my
    first encounter with this Brooklyn outfit, at an Oct. 2003 CMJ party at Lit,
    Vietnam were a model of misanthropy: three scraggly dudes with faces obscured
    by long hair and crazy-homeless-guy beards, dispensing somnambulant Spacemen 3
    stoner-blues in slow-acting 10-minute doses, ignoring the audience completely.
    The only thing to latch onto was Michael Gerner's familiarly Dylanesque spiel,
    though even at his grumpiest, Bob never demanded that you to ""pull your
    fuckin' cock to prove you're not dead."" Given the lethargic delivery, you
    half-expected Vietnam to heed their own advice and start tugging at their own
    johnsons.</p><p>
    The guys playing that CMJ show appear on this new, self-titled Vietnam
    album, but in so many ways, this is not the same band. Singer/guitarist Gerner,
    guitarist Josh Grubb, and drummer Michael Foss have since filled out the
    line-up with a bassist (Ivan Berko) and made a bunch of fabulous new friends,
    including Jenny Lewis (who provides guest vocals) and, most improbably, Maroon
    5 bassist Mickey Madden (who co-produced the album with the Beachwood Sparks'
    Dave Scher). The extra bodies have inspired Vietnam to craft an album of
    surprisingly lush and tender country-soul hymns that are several degrees
    warmer and more inviting than the monochromatic dirges of their earlier EP <em>The
    Concrete Is Always Grayer on the Other Side of the Street</em>. You can easily
    gauge the before/after effect in the one song that features on both discs,
    ""Apocalypse"". Formerly a rambling solo electric-guitar piece, the
    song is jolted to life with dramatic blasts of brass that goad Gerner into a
    more sympathetic portrayal of a burnout at the end of his wick; now, when he
    belts out the chorus line-- ""All I wanted was to feel... the heat!""--
    it sounds like wish fulfillment.</p><p>
    In their recent <em>Fader</em> cover story, Vietnam claim they began writing
    this album in a sublet that had suddenly had all its electricity and utilities
    cut off, which would account not just for the album's nocturnal, intimate nature, but also its air of hard-fought perseverance. If there's still a
    connection to the Spacemen 3, it's that centerpiece soul ballad
    ""Toby"" provides the bittersweet punch line to that band's
    ""taking drugs to make music for people to take drugs to"" joke: that
    is, friends OD and die. And if the album does little to suppress Gerner's
    hard-on for Dylan, the real commonality isn't so much their voices-- Gerner's
    is more throaty than nasal-- but in the choice of imagery, with songs about
    corruption and class disparity populated by nameless characters identified only
    by their vocation (the priest, the poet, the lawyer, etc). 
    </p>
<p>
    Enjoyment of Vietnam will hinge on your tolerance of Gerner's gruff croon and stretched-out melody lines-- particularly on late-night-stroll serenades
    like ""Toby"" and ""Too Tired""-- but where the singer once
    came off as cranky, he now exudes real charisma: the rousing, freedom-rock
    chorus of ""Gabe"" overshadows the blatant cop of the ""how many
    times"" lyrical structure of ""Blowin' in the Wind""; the red-light grind of ""Mr. Goldfinger"" is as seductively seedy as the champagne-room exploits that play out in its verses; and in the
    acoustic Zep-grooved ""Summer in the City"" (not to be confused with
    the Lovin' Spoonful song), Vietnam could score themselves the Williamsburg
    patio-party tune of the coming season. Vietnam always looked like hippies; it's
    nice to hear them acting like them, too.

Crowning a first-album singer the Princess of ANYTHING is premature (witness Def Jam/Roc-a-Fella singer Teairra Mari: once ""Princess of the Roc,"" now dropped). But with CC, as we came to know her, the crown fit. As a breathy alto and successor to Aaliyah, she was no slouch-- a Dirty South debutante with melodies, moves, and moxie-- and <em>Goodies</em> was delicious, ripe with electro-bass bits and year-making guest appearances (Ludacris on ""Oh"", what).</p><p>
    OK SO, CHERCHEZ LA ""PRINCESS OF CRUNK &amp; B.""</p><p>
<em>Goodies</em> had no fat to cut. <em>The Evolution</em> is puffy with non-stunners and factory stamps. In Ciara's effort to prove herself a diva, her second album flails, bloated with spoken-word interludes and boilerplate pop &amp; b that obscures some truly good songs. On <em>The Evolution</em>, Ciara tries too hard to fashion herself after her idols Janet Jackson and Aaliyah. She overextends and overexplains, sacrificing her Southernness and stumbling on her own fleet feet.
    </p><p>
    It starts out strong, with the hi-impact Lil Jon bonecrusher ""That's Right"", in which Ciara asserts her right to party with her girls and have fun (or ""phone,"" as she puts it in her interminably charming down-south brogue). That's followed by the excellent ""Like a Boy"", a stadium anthem about double standards dramatized by up-and-coming co-ed production team the Clutch. But after the mondo-hit ""Promise"", the purple-storm Polow Da Don ballad Ciara serves like a sensual après-Prince, <em>The Evolution</em> begins its slow downward slide. Ciara wants to prove how much she's grown in two years, mostly by proffering grand-statement anthems and bland anysongs between meta-tracks about dancing and some genuinely solid pop singles. She intros many of these with life-coach-y spoken interludes and mid-song soliloquies-- a throwback to Jackson's <em>Control</em>. Unfortunately, her generalized bon mots can come off forced, flat, and workhorse-like, and they're not even all that personal (i.e., ""The past years of my life have truly been a journey""). Standard-issue tracks include:
    </p>
<p>
    1.	Two Missy Elliott-style throwback jams (the Bambaataa-esque ""I Proceed"" and ""Make it Last Forever""), which producer Rodney ""Darkchild"" Jerkins patterned after Rob Base and E-Z Rock's ""It Takes Two"". On the break, Ciara raps Base's iconic verse almost verbatim, which seems lazy, at best.
    </p>
<p>
    2.	Two kiln-fired, ""baby-girl"" type crossover singles, in the spirit of ""Like You"", her great duet with alleged ex-boyfriend Bow Wow. One song features 50 Cent and a music-box synth (the admittedly delectable dopeboy-lover ""Can't Leave 'Em Alone""). The other is called ""My Love"". Both conjure benched G-Unit crooner Olivia.
    </p>
<p>
    3.	One weirdly wooden metaphor using the fit of her jeans as example of her growth as a person and artist. Stop talking… stay dancing!  
    </p>
<p>
    Part of <em>The Evolution</em>'s weakness is testament to the inevitability of producers like Darkchild, whose sound has been so distinct and so ubiquitous in the past year it's starting to feel like wallpaper. But Ciara's spoken-word interludes are her own conceit, an assumption that we need her to tell us who she is. When Ciara's singing, production and assertions of grown-womanhood synergize, she rules both on the dancefloor and in the ozone. She hasn't earned the right to strut like a veteran, but on <em>The Evolution</em>, it's like she's forgotten she's already a Princess.<br/>

    daft. But to be fair, the guy's biggest mistake since entering the
    post-Blur era has been his failure to recognize it as the post-Blur
    era. So even as he globetrots to Mali or grooves in Gorillaz,
    everything Albarn does feels a little bit like a side project, which
    unfortunately casts his often quite good music as an afterthought
    rather than the real deal.</p><p>
    If perception is such a big part of the game, though, then Albarn has
    stacked things in his favor with the
    Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen-- another name, another band, this one with
    something for nearly everyone because it features someone for nearly
    everyone. On bass, Clash veteran Paul Simonon. On guitar, Simon Tong, late of the Verve. On
    drums, the unimpeachable Afrobeat master Tony Allen. Behind the
    boards, somewhere, the ubiquitous, beloved Danger Mouse. And Albarn
    himself on top, his ego and voice the would-be X-factor that ties
    these disparate kindred souls together.</p><p>
    A name like the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, awkward though it may be,
    implies a certain degree of fun to be had, and on its face you'd think
    the all-star cast would cinch it, but that's not what Commander Albarn
    and crew are up to. Feel Bad, Inc. would be a more appropriate moniker for this moody and often dreary outfit. To call the doom-laden tracks on the self-titled disc downbeat would
    be an understatement. Downtrodden is more like it, as Albarn has
    (subversively? deviously? deliriously?) instructed or encouraged these
    purveyors of pulsating grooves to slow things down to a
    narcotic crawl for most of the record's duration. The results are cohesive
    almost by default, considering how monochromatic the bulk of the disc
    comes off. Yet monochrome by design isn't necessarily a bad thing,
    especially when you're out to challenge rather than entertain.
    </p><p>
    No doubt, it's risky business to follow Gorillaz's well-selling and critically lauded <em>Demon Days</em> with music designed to move you emotionally rather than physically. An undercurrent of dissatisfaction courses
    through <em>The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen</em>, with a mumbly Albarn forcing
    you to lean deep into the murk to decipher his downer words. ""History Song"" sets the mood, opening with a simple acoustic guitar
    motif that's soon fleshed out-- barely-- by the submarine bass,
    haunted backing vocals, and a surprisingly restrained Allen skittering
    along. ""80s Life"" throws in rudimentary piano. And for the most part,
    back and forth the tracks go, reveling in simplicity despite the
    surplus of talented contributors, never once shaking free of the
    self-imposed shackles. Even the melodies sound intuitive and
    unfinished, as if Albarn didn't feel the need to elaborate on whatever
    spare demos he unearthed that gave birth to this album.
    </p>
<p>
    If there's a direct musical antecedent to Albarn mood music of this
    bent it's the early Blur track ""Sing"" (most prominently enlisted on
    the <em>Trainspotting</em> soundtrack), albeit bolstered by Simonon's dubby
    throb and set on the same paranoid, post-apocalyptic landscape of the
    two Gorillaz discs. Likewise, ""The Northern Whale"" and
    ""The Bunting Song"" are as prototypically, provincially English as
    anything by Blur as well, but they sound like sad, elegiac
    celebrations of what once was rather than what is, reminiscent in mood of <em>Parklife</em>'s ""This Is a Low"". ""The medicine man
    is here 24-7/ You can get it fast in Armageddon,"" moans
    Albarn in the first single ""Herculean"". ""Everyone is on their way to
    Heaven, slowly."" It's like his version of the simultaneously pre- and
    post-apocalyptic <em>Children of Men</em>-- contemporary malaise and moral
    decay recast ominously as science fiction.
    </p>
<p>
    And what's got Albarn down? Why, war of course. War, or reference to
    war, permeates or pops up in half the tracks-- ""Nature Springs"",
    ""Behind the Sun"", ""Green Fields"", ""80s Life"", ""Kingdom of Doom""-- with
    war's horrors and aftermath alluded to in the rest. No specific war,
    per se, though one may infer Albarn's disagreement with the engagement
    in Iraq looms large. Only as presented here, the battle already sounds
    lost, the sound of a would-be revolutionary or freedom fighter giving
    up without a fight, weary with resignation as he digs yet another row
    of graves. ""I don't want to live a war/ That's got no end in our time,"" goes a
    line in ""80s Life"", as hopeless a confession as one might hear.
    </p>
<p>
    No wonder the disc never really springs to life until ""Three Changes"", 10 songs in, though lyrically the song remains the same: ""Today is
    dull and mild/ On a stroppy little island/ Of mixed up people"" sounds
    like a mash-up of the weather report and editorial page.
    </p>
<p>
    Yet despite the relentless, beautiful gloom, as the concluding title
    track devolves into a noisy art-glam implosion it does feel like the
    end of a journey has been reached. But where have we been? And what
    did we learn along the way? That the world's in a bad place, of
    course. And Albarn's here to rub your face in it until that sinks in.

    Gang Starr always looked at rap as a problem to be solved. The Brooklyn-based duo of Guru and DJ Premier started with a sort of ideal vision of rap-- thick and organic beats and smoothly virtuosic rhymes-- and spent 15 years trying to recreate that sound. At their start, they identified themselves with a late-1980s/early-90s jazz-rap vanguard; witness the obsessively namedroppy early single ""Jazz Thing"", not included on this best-of. Before long, though, their jazz influence faded into the background, returning to front-and-center only on Guru's Jazzmatazz side project. Instead, Premier internalized that jazz influence, filing it alongside funk and film soundtracks for use in his sonic template, a warm but choppy classicist boom-bap that's barely changed in the past 18 years. Gang Starr's 1989 single ""Manifest"", with its itchy bongos and guitar ripples, might be slightly busier and less assured than their 2003 single ""Skills"", but the two songs could've still come out a week apart. Gang Starr arrived so fully formed that they never needed to evolve; fittingly, <em>Mass Appeal </em>ignores chronology, hitting shuffle on a blissfully consistent body of work.<em></em></p><p>
<em>Mass Appeal</em> is Gang Starr's second best-of, following the excellent 1999 2xCD <em>Full Clip</em>, which is still in print. The new collection includes some lukewarm rarities and rescues a couple of tracks from the spotty 2003 album <em>The Ownerz</em>, but all of <em>Mass Appeal</em>'s best tracks were already on <em>Full Clip</em>, and <em>Mass Appeal</em>'s single-disc constraints make for a couple of puzzling exclusions: no ""You Know My Steez""? There's also a DVD that collects the music videos, which would be awesome if YouTube didn't exist. Still, <em>Mass Appeal</em> makes for a deeply satisfying end-to-end listen, an hour-long submersion into the group's dusty warmth.</p><p>
    A huge part of <em>Mass Appeal</em>'s listenablility is the thick, intuitive chemistry between Guru and Premier, two artists who always highlighted each other's strengths. Premier is one of rap's great producers, a staunch fundamentalist who stayed within his genre's self-imposed constraints and used them to test his own inventiveness, transforming his looped breakbeats and mutilated samples into intricately layered symphonies of rhythm.
    </p>
<p>
    Premier has done great work with half of the greatest figures in rap history, but titans like Biggie and Jay-Z have always tended to fight against his float, going for booming dominance instead of crackly lilt. With Guru, he had a partner who knew how to step into the background and let his calm monotone blend in with the beats. Guru's voice is smooth and natural enough to bring an easy authority to even his most awkward and convoluted lines (""like Tom Hanks I earn long bank and cast you away""). The two of them worked up a formula with plenty of room for subtle variations. When Guru rapped about relationships, as on the breakup lament ""Ex-Girl to the Next Girl"", Premier let a little more melody creep into his basslines, giving a certain pathos to Guru's conversational candor: ""Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature/ I told her, 'Hey look, yo, I can no longer date ya.'"" And when Guru rapped about violence, as on the nightclub-shooting story ""Soliloquy of Chaos"", Premier's loops took on a frantic, claustrophobic edge.
    </p>
<p>
    Another great thing about the Gang Starr formula: Guru's voice was so flat and relaxed that it highlighted the peculiarities of every guest rapper who ever appeared on a Gang Starr track, making for some amazing collaborations. On the party-jam ""DWYCK"", Nice and Smooth take their cartoonish goofiness to insane highs. On ""Militia"", Guru's unflappability beautifully offsets the terrifying bluster of an on-fire Freddie Foxxx. And on ""Above the Clouds"", even Wu-Tang journeyman Inspectah Deck pulses with adrenaline. Those guest spots poke quick, ecstatic holes in the lush, controlled spell that Guru and Premier cast, but they can't break it: When those two guys were locked in together, everything complemented everything else.

    Improvisation is easy, and ""neat"" improvisation is only as
    hard as having a concept or a technique to get behind. But truly compelling
    improvisation? Nearly impossible, one of those flimsier-than-nebulous things
    that most can recognize but very few can create, let alone capture. There are
    no rules and no easy predictions. Anticipated gems corrode. Unexpected wonders
    delight.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    For instance, there's not much to suggest that Tony Conrad
    and Charlemagne Palestine would work well together as improvisers: Both are
    most often relegated to support roles in 20<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 9.16667px"">th</span> century composition
    and, more specifically, early American minimalism. In the 1970s, both made their
    way through the Kitchen, an experimental venue in SoHo that showcased early
    work from Steve Reich, Brian Eno and Pauline Oliveros, among others. Earlier,
    they were active in the 60s downtown scene: Conrad as the violinist and
    filmmaker who shared a loft with Velvet Underground bandmate John Cale and his
    ideas on Just intonation with Dream Syndicate founder LaMonte Young; Palestine
    as a ritualist explorer of electronic drones, brilliantly dense compositions
    for solo piano and vocal improvisations given to tribal leaps from the Western
    scale. What's more, before the two reunited in Belgium in 2001, Conrad and
    Palestine, both now sexagenarians, hadn't <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">seen</span><span> one another in three decades. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But-- on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">An Aural Symbiotic Mystery</span><span>, their first-ever issued collaboration from what was
    their fourth concert together in three decades-- Conrad and Palestine happen upon
    one of the most inspired releases of either of their careers. And they do it by doing
    the unexpected. Neither Conrad or Palestine, both artists with stringent solo
    reputations, ever dominate the 52-minute performance. Then again, neither is
    doing exactly what made them notable. Sure, they're behind their famed apparatuses, Conrad bowing his modified, five-string violin and
    burning proper tone at the bow as Palestine constructs multi-spire monuments
    from a gaggle of keyboards. But this isn't minimalism. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mystery</span><span> could only be considered 20<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 9.16667px"">th</span> century
    composition if, in fact, that canon were to (properly) include names like
    Albert Ayler and Cecil Taylor. Instead, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mystery</span><span> is a battle that starts nice and easy, Conrad
    building blisters over Palestine's smooth integument. Some 35 minutes in,
    Palestine finally augments an organ tonic that's been running the entire time,
    his demented sacral tones chasing Conrad's hellfire up through shifting
    cathedral arches. Soon they collapse, leaving Conrad alone. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But, in this collaboration, things become unsettled in the
    stability of solitude. Moments coalesce between Conrad and Palestine:
    Sometimes, they sound like a glorious, two-man take on the Art Ensemble of
    Chicago, emotions heated until they cinder into flurries of hot ash. As with
    Art Ensemble's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Great Black Music,</span><span> </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mystery
    </span><span>is more about a force and a feeling than an
    idea, though a dozen of those-- from Palestine's jig-jag scales that jump to dissonance
    without notice to the way Conrad taunts consonance even when Palestine lights
    upon it-- make their case. Palestine and Conrad burn through them all, squeezing
    out the air and carbon, much like Ayler's tenor saxophone at its peak. Conrad's
    violin even sounds like Ayler at one point, stuttering, guttural steps of
    spitfire spontaneity ricocheting off of Palestine's pedal points like thin
    sparks against a strong alloy. Ayler and his violinist Michael Samson built a
    similar solidify-and-splinter, distend-or-dodge repartee in the late 60s. Here,
    Conrad, on violin, supplies the splinters to Palestine's beautiful keyboard and
    vocal sustains. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    It's a subversion that's compelling because it's
    unintentional, and potent because it's natural. If anything, it's proof-positive
    that, as heated improvisation goes, it doesn't matter who's playing what or how
    long (or here, how <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">often</span><span>)</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span><span>they have worked together. It's spirit and guts. And </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">An
    Aural Symbiotic Mystery</span><span>
    proves-- conclusively, dare I say-- that Conrad and Palestine have an abundance of
    both. </span>

Craft's debut is one such example.  Released more than six months ago in his native country, Craft's downplayed take on mainstream folk failed to hook anyone statesde other than the odd mp3 blogger.  The virus spread, died, and was picked up again as the record made it onto scattered year-end lists.  Unified by a punchy timbre and muted, shimmying percussion-- a combination that sometimes results in memorable tracks-- the album's quiet, solitary perambulations around cyberspace fit the character of a lonely, lovely, and modest work.</p><p>
    Martin Craft has a persistent disposition for the atmosphere shared by the work of later Beatles, Van Morrison, Neil Young, and to some extent Captain Beefheart: reduced treble, percussion beholden to guitars and vocals, and slow, lazy rhythmic structures.  The paw prints of Young's ""Southern Man"" and Beefheart's <em>The Spotlight Kid</em> are all over Craft's ""Sweets"", although the Aussie employs dusty female vocals that barely deliver the lyrical message. That's indicative of the album as a whole: Craft masters record-collector rock without pretension, but putting his personal stamp on the product is another matter.</p><p>
    The album's golden nuggets, ""The Soldier"" and ""Love Knows How to Fight"", do resolutely brand Craft as a talent to watch.  These love-as-warfare numbers cancel out the numerous devolved and timid songs like ""Sweets"" and ""Emily Snow"". A sleep-inducing narrative about a young girl, ""Emily"" is an arid field to ""The Soldier""'s Big Sur clifftop.  ""Soldier"" begins with tumbling, throbbing percussion, guitar, and bass, still turned down to mezzo piano.  Proximate chords rumble with just a hint of the melody to come, and before you know it, a startling female chorus has punctured the end of Craft's guitar-bass segment and repeats before the first verse of lyrics even begins.
    </p><p>
    The tone of the lyrics is equal parts pathetic and sexy, a finesse that James Blunt, to whom Craft has absurdly been compared, can only dream about dreaming about. Lyrics such as ""What I would do to be close to you/ What I would do for your touch"" are nothing new; it's the delivery that cinches the seams.  Hand claps, a looping, ascending bass sequence, and those hollow, Morricone-inspired howls decorate the song throughout, and it's those moments rather than the more jarring key change in the chorus that stand out. (Craft has a penchant for changing moods mid-song, and it's typically a draw-- even on his less-interesting songs.)
    </p>
<p>
    Along with the aforementioned, ""Love Knows How to Fight"" pushes minimalist Bee Gees ballads like ""Teardrop Tattoo"" entirely out of the picture, though the reminiscent banjos and climbing vocal mumbles on the waltzing ""I Got Nobody Waiting For Me"" are worth a listen.  ""Fight"" is like most of the album: Bound to romance, a tad sulky, but bemused and thoughtful to the point of actually deriving a fair amount of optimism from the artist's process.  But ""Fight"" is the triumphal march to the daydreaming early movements.  It still resides in the Craft comfort zone (same studio, same effects), but punches with a verve not often detectable on the album.  Craft uses a winding, repetitive major-key melody and lyrics that roll off the tongue with surprising energy: ""And the sky/ Is a roof made of tin/ With a million holes/ For the light to get in/ And beyond/ Is an endless sea/ Of lucidity/ An infinity of light.""  It may sound like a hipster teaching his kid about the universe, but you'll want to hear this lesson.

    Brill's sonic palette has evolved at a dramatic rate, elevating him
    from a meat-and-potatoes, coffeeshop hound to full-blown studio mad
    scientist. <em>Harpooner</em> takes the next logical step after <em>New Pagan Love Song</em>,
    Brill's first self-produced, self-engineered record. Whereas <em>New Pagan</em> grafted computer glitches onto a warm acoustic medium, <em>Harpooner</em>
    completes the transformation to bionic singer-songwriter. Although the phlegmatic Brill's never
    been one to slap you in the face with a riveting melody, here his
    stoicism's enabled further by studio tinkering that's often at odds with his song's stripped-down core.</p><p>
    Opener ""Consanguine"" promptly sets the standard for <em>Harpooner</em>'s
    wandering, amorphous soundscapes. Brill can barely utter a phrase
    before he's engulfed by a hodgepodge of swirling horns, woodwinds, mandolins, and percussion. The use of so many sounds over such a weak
    framework deflates any attempt at a buildup, sabotaging the the
    intended payoff of Brill's deadpan chorus, ""All I want is nothing.""</p><p>
    Attention
    to atmosphere isn't always a misstep though. The
    brooding ""That's the Way"" shuffles through expansive symbol crashes and
    tom-tom beats, the metallic effect on Brill's vocals conjuring the
    misanthropy of Thom Yorke's sonically and emotionally bleak <em>The Eraser</em>. While <em>Harpooner</em> relies heavily on such understated
    songwriting, it's not without immediate moments. Standout
    ""Paris Is On"" sports the album's lone anthemic chorus, as well as a
    clearly defined verse-chorus-verse structure. Brill even shows flashes of conventional
    Elliott Smith-styled indie folk, peppering the psychologically dark
    closer ""And So to Sleep..."" with catchy, Beatles-esque hooks.
    </p><p>
    Added
    up, however, these peaks can't make up for protracted stretches
    of languid experimentation for experimentation's sake. Even more
    frustrating about Brill's eclectic instrumentation is how he fails to
    expand stylistically. Every song is vanilla indie pop; the mandolins
    don't make anything sound more psychedelic, and the brass and woodwinds
    don't add anything another piano part couldn't. While <em>Harpooner</em>
    testifies to Brill's talents, his aesthetic nods to Talk
    Talk or Elliott Smith can't cover up his lack of a grand, artistic
    gesture.

    Like candles in the goddamn wind, man. The long, blonde leading ladies of classic film were larger than life, and every one a muse: ""She's a femme fatale,"" Nico sang with the Velvet Underground, supposedly in reference to fellow Warhol superstar Edie Sedgwick. ""She looks like Eve Marie-Saint in 'On the Waterfront',"" swooned Lloyd Cole on his 1984 hit ""Rattlesnakes"".  Even Billy Bragg had Woody Guthrie's ""Ingrid Bergman"" on <em>Mermaid Avenue</em>.</p><p>
    A quintet of two guys and three dolls, the Long Blondes seem obsessed with cinema-- Sedgwick, Anna
    Karina, Arlene Dahl, <em>From Here to Eternity</em>, and C.C. Baxter:
    All they want is ""a good film noir and a bottle of gin."" If those starlets of the silver screen can be blamed for our culture's
    impossible standards regarding the opposite sex, clearly it's all that hardcore,
    girl-next-door interporn that offers enough ""reality"" for guys to hold down
    jobs, tie our shoes, and buy Valentine's Day presents. Sheffield's the
    Long Blondes say: <em>You could have both!!!</em></p><p>
    Produced by Pulp's Steve Mackey (singles re-recorded, sadly), the Long Blondes inherit that band's arched back and sharp tongue, plus a bit of Elastica's love of borrowed late-70s riffs. So they're the pop-punk Dusty Springfield to fellow Sheffield band the Arctic Monkeys' provincial kids-today Kinks. But what the album really tells us most about is the divide between the girls on film and our little iWorld-- the contrasts between romantic notions and dreary humdrum, wants and needs, love and being in love, and inertia and bone-jumping. It makes you wonder why anyone actually likes the Kooks.
    </p>
<p>
    ""I know all about fear and desire,"" Jackson asserts on brazen opener ""Lust in the Movies"", sounding like she lives on lipgloss, cigarettes, and glasses of wine. And she does know fear, of a sort: She's often measuring herself against idealized competition, as on ""In the Company of Women"" (""What's she got that I might not?""), or waiting out the other girl rather than risk loneliness (on ""Only Lovers Left Alive""). She talks a lot in the imperative (""Don't turn around, don't walk away,"" or ""Don't go to London""), and, on ""Heaven Help the New Girl"", she updates the classic trembly girl-group
    ballad better than anybody (apart from Camera Obscura's Tracyanne
    Campbell), with an arrangement equally suitable for Morrissey or Colin
    Meloy.  
    </p>
<p>
    Jackson's got desire down, as well: ""There are wants and there are needs/ And they're two very different
    things/ You can love or be in love,"" she sets forth in ""Weekend Without
    Makeup"". On upbeat twentysomething tragedy ""Swallow Tattoo"", she's distressed by
    the significance of a common prison tattoo, but still wants to... you
    know. And on the extra-catchy single ""Once and Never Again"", she knows how it feels to be 19 -- and she'd ""love to feel a girl [that] age."" <br/>
</p>
<p>
    As Pulp's Jarvis Cocker quipped on his band's breakthrough album, <em>His 'n' Hers</em>:
    ""Imagine it's a film and you're the star.../ You might get your
    happy ending/ Your ending, the thing you deserve."" Most so-called
    ""cinematic"" records earn that distinction due to some quirk of reverb or
    their use of space, but the Long Blondes only have modern England's
    typically confined, 17-year-old-from-Doncaster guitar-dudish sound. Instead, it's the songs themselves, their narratives, and their
    characters that speak to the band's widescreen ambitions. None
    achieves this with more success than ""You Could Have Both"", the Long Blondes' most expansive
    moment, as a blistering circa-1993 proto-Britpop guitar charges into
    yet another love triangle that doesn't make any difference to Jackson.
    ""I don't kid myself about happy endings,"" she insists, speaking at
    last like a true femme fatale.

    Taken in succession, the three compilations French dance
    label Kitsuné released in the first half of this decade (<em>Love</em>, <em>Midnight</em>, and <em>X</em>) tell a story of a
    dance hedonist crash-landing on a strange planet, a meteorite fall-from-grace
    which begins with lush disco-house, plummets through chilly electro-house, and
    skids to a halt with crunching electro-rock. With the commencement of the <em>Kitsuné
    Maison</em> series, the story shifts in tone to
    something of a Robinson Crusoe rewrite, the erstwhile dance explorers settling
    into their newfound home and trying to build stable structures out of limited,
    unreliable sonic materials.</p><p>
    That Kitsuné have managed to fire off three of
    their <em>Kitsuné Maison</em> compilations
    in the space of one year is a testament to both their industriousness and the
    increasingly firm sense of self-identity which characterizes this as yet
    unnamed colony (the Nu French Touch? Haircut House? Indieclash?).  <em>Kitsuné Maison 3 </em>continues
    in the vein of its immediate predecessor, in a somewhat raffish mixture of steroid-laden
    electro-house, hard-riffing electro-rock and curiously frail indie-rock--
    although no Wolfmother this time around, thank God. The appeal of this stuff
    for rock kids dipping their toes into dance music is pretty clear, but it's less
    obvious that the fusion works in the other direction, even if the preponderance
    of dance producers messing with rock on this compilation might suggest
    otherwise.</p><p>
    But then, Kitsuné's current roster make no attempt to hide the fact
    that they are merely following a path laid out by Daft Punk, Output, the DFA,
    electroclash, Tiefschwarz and-- Lord help us-- Rinôçérôse. These producers
    haven't found a new way to tackle the problem of merging rock and dance,
    they're just doing it more simply and impatiently than before. Sometimes the old hands do as they have always done: The
    compilation's most successful rock song is the sly, sexy ""Home Wit U"" by Freeform Five, who mastered the whole
    electro-house-as-arena-rock manœuvre on an epic remix of their own ""Strangest
    Things"" in 2004, back when the genre's
    senses of energy, accomplishment and finesse weren't so aggressively untangled from each other. Quite obviously the best produced track here, ""Home
    Wit U""'s shuddering beat and fluorescent
    blobs of keyboards remain more muscular than the weedy guitar sections drafted
    in on every second track.
    </p>
<p>
    Electro-house didn't need tenuously tuneful, shouty rock acts and their
    attendant remixers in order to come to grips with guitar music, and Kitsuné's
    rapprochement with amateurish rock signifiers often adds less than it takes
    away, jettisoning the sexuality of house without actually upping the sweaty
    rock catharsis factor. Sometimes instead the rock just gets in the way of all the fun: The
    speed disco pulse of Oh No! Oh My!'s ""I Love You All the Time"" would be fine if they just left out the turgid indie
    rock vocals and jarring guitar strums.
    </p>
<p>
    If <em>Kitsuné Maison 3</em> turns
    out to be slightly better in practice than in theory, it's because a great deal
    can still be achieved within the confines of the legacy it struggles to uphold:
    Soulwax's crashing take on the Gossip's ""Standing in the Way of
    Control"" would fade quickly in a head-to-head with Black Strobe, but it's amusing to hear Soulwax upend their entire
    toybox of sonic tricks so wantonly. In the other direction, Simian Mobile
    Disco's ""I Believe"" is surprisingly
    coy slow motion Italopop, its fragility and plasticity a welcome respite from
    all the posturing.
    </p>
<p>
    Even more impressive is the Whitest Boy Alive's ""Done With
    You"", which moves from pastoral rock to
    spacey disco-punk simply by leaning into its guitar picking and opening its
    hi-hats. It sounds like it should have been released on Factory Records in
    1982, without sounding quite like anything that actually was released on Factory Records in 1982. Most
    importantly, it sounds like it doesn't know what on earth it wants to be.

    Baltimore's Ponytail look like they'd tip the scales, collectively, at
    around 385 pounds. So the racket they make is loud and dense but not beefy.
    There's no bass, fer instance, but the two guitars do play low notes sometimes.
    And they also look like their collective age is somewhere around 60, which
    sounds old until you realize there's four of 'em. So their music definitely
    sounds like kids at summer camp, kids on the wrong side of four pitchers of bug
    juice. The best way I can think of to describe it is ""a ruckus.""</p><p>
    People might compare Ponytail to Deerhoof-- indeed, some already have-- but
    I'm not really the one to debate the comparison's accuracy. And maybe it's just
    the weird gloss of digital production, but what they're doing sounds pretty
    damn original to me. The band's guitars are so bright and trebly that they make
    me think of colors before, like, notes and melodies and stuff: hot pinks, baby
    blues, neon greens, traffic cone orange. Guitarists Ken Seeno and Dustin Wong
    like speedy one-note runs (ADD kids tapping their pencils against their desks),
    big surf rock arpeggios played on three-dollar plastic axes, and strangely
    pretty sweeps of prickly nylon-stringed strums.</p><p>
    These Toys ""R"" Us tunings are used for tiny, tinny pop-punk
    timebombs. Ponytail know that art rock is almost always better in double-time.
    So the ne-ner-ne-ner-ne-ner riffs cruise along with the fuck-safety-helmets
    glee of kids doing BMX tricks as the drums clatter behind them. Occasionally
    the joy of making this noise gets to be too much for the 'Tail and they
    collapse into giggles, smashed cymbals, unison roars, and rainbow feedback. And
    then they right themselves and rev almost immediately back into action.
    </p>
<p>
    All of which would just be so much treble-kicking fun if not for Ponytail's
    secret weapon, vocalist Molly Sigel. Her cries, coos, shrieks, growls, and a
    full array of preverbal (or is it post-verbal?) noises take Kleenex's scatty
    nonsense and the Raincoats wordless longing and suck all the meaning out. Live,
    it's almost a shock when Sigel's tiny frame begins shaking violently as she
    throws a temper tantrum and reclaims Cookie Monster voices from death metal
    kids. On <em>Kamehameha </em>she's more or less adrift in the swirl of glossy
    guitar plunks and zings, rather than the band's focal point, though this might
    be a recording issue. Still, there's really no other rock vocalist like her
    right now.
    </p>
<p>
    Ponytail's debut is one of the few things keeping me feeling young right
    now. It's all aimless, nervous, sugar-shocker energy, delivered in
    easy-to-swallow form in less than 30 minutes. When the music blog Idolator recently posted one of the band's songs, a grouch beefed
    in the comments box that they didn't have, like, a point. To which I'd say: if
    p-p-p-pure energy isn't reason enough for a rock band to exist, check your
    pulse and/or your stated reasons for liking music (or being alive) in the first
    place.

    Yabby You isn't the biggest name in roots reggae, but as an artist and producer
    he generated a body of work that measures up well next to the work of giants
    like Burning Spear, the Abyssinians, and Culture. Born Vivian Jackson, Yabby
    was in his twenties when he first took to the producer's chair at Channel One Studios
    and cut the deep roots trilogy of <em>Conquering Lion</em>, <em>Walls of Jerusalem</em>,
    and <em>Deliver Me from My Enemies</em>, a formidable set of albums that
    established his decidedly sparse and rhythmically steady sound.</p><p>
<em>Deliver Me from My Enemies</em> is the third and final album in the
    series; it's clear that Yabby was getting a bit restless, as it's the least
    consistently fundamentalist of the three. A pair of lovers rock tunes-- one a
    cover of a song by John Holt, the master of the form-- inject variety and
    signify that Yabby was about more than just singing the praises of Jah and
    African unity, though he still did plenty of both on the record. Blood &amp;
    Fire's reissue follows the label's earlier two-fer packaging of <em>Conquering
    Lion</em> and <em>Walls of Jerusalem</em> and is fortified with seven tracks not
    on the original album.</p><p>
    Yabby got his hard, steady rhythms the same way a lot of Jamaican producers
    did in the 1970s: by anchoring his songs to the rock-solid rhythm section of
    drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare, who provide the bedrock
    here. Sax legend Tommy McCook leads the three-piece horn section, which
    provides the album's opening fanfare, a drawn-out, roughshod melody dustily
    recorded by Yabby. There's a memory-like haziness to the way Yabby captured
    most of his horn parts, as though he was trying to get them to sound like the
    way he thought of Africa, an entity halfway between tangible and intangible,
    simultaneously a part of his past and his possible future. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album's title track is positively mighty, with the aforementioned horn
    theme and Yabby's doubled vocals riding an almost unnervingly deliberate rhythm
    track. The reissue includes the version from the ""Deliver Me"" 45's
    B-side, sequenced directly after the original. The new vocal on the version humorously
    appropriates the Little Miss Muffet children's rhyme, replacing curds and whey
    with a cherry pie and the spider with a dreadlock who ""takes her away."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Then-current events get a rare airing from Yabby on ""Pound Get a
    Blow"", equating devaluation of the Jamaican pound with the encroachment of
    Babylon. ""Pick the Beam"", which opens with a chord progression that
    nods to Cannonball Adderley's ""Mercy Mercy Mercy"", is an appeal from
    Yabby to clear the obstructions that block our own view of the world, so that
    we can then lead, rather than proselytize. The bonus tracks include two murky,
    echo-laden dubplates of the song that each offer an interesting spin on the
    original. 
    </p>
<p>
    In fact, it's a bonus track that steals the whole show. The 12"" mix of
    ""Babylon a Fall"", credited to the Prophets, a group founded by Yabby,
    is a thumping vocal trio track ballasted by a liquid line from Robbie
    Shakespeare. After the vocal trio finishes its work, the horns each take a solo
    on the long coda, with McCook breaking out his flute for a long duel with the
    rhythm section. 
    </p>
<p>
    The only somewhat jarring additions are the two sides of a 12"" Yabby
    recorded with DJ Trinity, whose toasting is mixed strangely high and comes as
    something of a shock so late in the disc. That said, they're not bad songs, even
    if one of them does bizarrely list Guatemala as an African country. <em>Deliver
    Me from My Enemies</em> is ultimately a set most roots fans will want to get
    their hands on, as it wraps up a classic run in the studio by Yabby, gathers a
    lot of rare material in one place and sounds excellent remastered directly from
    the source.

    while they're ostensibly supposed to bring the artist ""up to date""
    and keep their music alive by merging classic records with new techniques and
    technologies, the artist so honored always winds up sounding older and deader.
    Though Nina Simone passed just a few years ago, through much of this set she
    sounds like her contributions were peeled off of an old 78; absent her usual
    arrangements, she becomes just another dusty Ghost of Music Past trapped
    inside some earringed bald guy's machine.</p><p>
    Not that there's anything wrong with that. If records
    were ever agreed to be holy and beyond the reach of those who like to tinker,
    those days are long gone. Everything is a work in progress, to be continually
    repackaged, recontextualized, remastered, and yes, remixed-- legally and
    otherwise-- again and again. And Nina Simone, who fought hard and bitter fights
    for control of her art, is gone now, and her vote doesn't count. So you may as
    well meet a remix set like this in the middle.</p><p>
    The worst tracks here fail because they sound like
    they're trying to frame Simone as fashionably ""cool."" When singing,
    Simone could be pretentious, goofy, sentimental, melodramatic, angry, and compassionate;
    she almost never looked on at the world from an icy remove. Despite her
    often-tragic life, she wasn't Chet Baker. Her husky voice and sometimes
    behind-the-beat phrasing obviously serve as downtempo touchstones, but when
    given a trip-hop backing on Daniel Y's ""I Can't See Nobody"" or
    Coldcut's neo-big beat ""Save Me"", she's reduced to a cardboard
    cut-out, propped up in front as a one-dimensional caricature. And while she was
    to my ears perhaps the sexiest vocalist that ever lived, immersed in DJ Wally's
    mix on ""My Man's Gone Now"", she comes over as ""sexy"" in the
    manner of an airbrushed babe from a Skyy Vodka ad.
    </p><p>
    I do, however, have to give it up for Tony Humphries'
    ""Got U Turned on Dub"" remix of ""Turn Me On"". Enlivened by a
    snippet of sampled scat vocal and a bubblicious house beat, he alone finds the
    overflowing life that propelled Simone's best recordings. It's almost eight
    minutes long but has enough joy and generosity to go another five, easy. And
    while I'm not crazy about the reverb Francois K. puts on Simone's voice on his
    mix of ""Here Comes the Sun""-- a stylization that homogenizes the most
    distinctive of instruments-- the delicate arrangement and beat he stretches behind
    her have a certain charm. Behind those two, there are another two or three OK
    tracks, and the remainder of the record is pretty dire. Sad to say, it could
    have been worse.

There's the actual sound, of course-- the way matter quivers when struck or shifted; the tone imparted by drums stuffed with towels, ringing triangles, series of circuits triggered just so. This answers to physics, simple cause-and-effect.</p><p>
    Then there's our sense of expectancy, which plays games with the sound itself. This is more magisterial, contingent on atmosphere and anticipation. When you nod to a hip-hop beat, the <em>bap</em> that follows the <em>boom</em> owes its snap to where it falls in a succession; in jazz, the spray of a ride cymbal gains levity by contrast to weighty thuds and rushes below. Take any of these component parts in isolation and they lose something.</p><p>
    Dance music is all about the rules of such games. Much of the allure of listening to house and techno comes from submitting to structure; within formalist constraints so easy to recognize, the focus of attention turns fruitfully to details, tweaks, subtle shows of withholding and release that gain in importance what they cede to uniformity. Small flickers stand as grand flashes-- like an 8th grader who fashions herself cool and iconoclastic by flipping up the collar of a school-issued shirt.
    </p><p>
    The rules are there to be brokered and broken, and that's where the Herbert of <em>100 Lbs</em> comes in. Before drifting toward the emotive song cycles and ideological theatrics for which he's now known, Herbert helped toss the seeds for house and techno marked by personality as much as functionalism. His epochal 2000 DJ mix <em>Lets All Make Mistakes</em> drew manhandled smears and static over rhythms made to sound like they were thinking out loud-- and think out loud they did. Nothing in Herbert's rhythmic programming has ever sounded preordained; he's more interested in what stands to happen in those fleeting moments when decisions get made. 
    </p>
<p>
    Originally released in 1996 and reissued now with a bonus disc, <em>100 Lbs</em> gathers early 12""s from a time when Herbert was very much a ""dance music"" producer. It would be a while before he bedded down with domestic concerns (see <em>Around the House</em> and <em>Bodily Functions</em>, a brilliant dissection of a breakup with aching lyrics and pensive minimal grooves) and fancied himself foremost as a jazz/disco arranger (see <em>Goodbye Swingtime</em> by the Matthew Herbert Big Band and <em>Scale</em>, a 2006 album about the commutative properties of politics and heartbreak). Before thematic ambition became his main muse, Herbert made dance music that was about nothing more than itself. It's the kind of dance music that bides its time, as a vocal sample on <em>100 Lbs</em> says, ""thinking of you.""
    </p>
<p>
    Which is also a way of saying it's house music. Soulful vibes and sumptuous moods figure prominently in tracks charted with sketchy aims. In the humid, humming thickets of ""Desire"" and ""Oo Licky"", there's a breathy sense of uncertainty and hesitation that wanders in every few bars, when you can hear Herbert scratching his proverbial head over what best to drop in or trim away. That he sometimes messes up, or at least lets the pause get the better of him, is all the more inducement to keep alert.
    </p>
<p>
    It's best not to belabor the process-- as Herbert himself would later do when he issued a puritanical Dogme 95-like manifesto that didn't help deflect accusations of didacticism-- but the sense of tracks in various states of becoming adds to <em>100 Lbs</em>' significance, both as an artifact and as an album to be heard now. Lumbering tracks like ""Rude"" don't stand to wow in the context of the present day, but lithe ones like ""Take Me Back""-- a strange snatch of thwacking drums and wiggling synths-- do. They squirm free of the sell-by date that often haunts dance music so profoundly and measurably influential.
    </p>
<p>
    The bonus disc-- comprising B-sides and unreleased tracks from 1995 to 2000-- is deeper and dubbier, flush with hiccups and stutters of a literal and figurative sort. The sensuous voice of singer Dani Sicilliano gets chopped into abstract sibilants in ""Back to the Start"", while ""Back Back Back Back"" blows deep-hour spaciousness into ""Take Me Back"". It's unclear what sense of ""back"" Herbert was aiming for at the time-- tracks so singular and alive still sound anxious to get to the point in dance music that we're still getting to now.

<em>""I must have been missing the point for years <br/>
    I used to love misery, heartbreak and tears<br/>
    But that's just a memory<br/>
    Now you're sleeping here.""</em></p><p>
    Wow. What happened to Aidan Moffat? This is how he begins Arab Strap's
    farewell compilation, on a brief new song called ""Preface: Set the
    Scene"". Other sentiments in the song include, ""I think we'll be
    fine."" If this is how he feels these days, I guess it really was time for
    Moffat and his ten-year partner in acerbic misery, Malcolm Middleton, to hang up
    the Arab Strap name and move on. True happiness really has no
    place in their music, though plenty of humor found its way into the songs. This
    is, after all, a band that once named an album after the fear of falling in
    love.</p><p>
<em>Ten Years of Tears</em> is sort of an end-of-career best-of compilation,
    except that it doesn't include many of their best songs (""Love
    Detective"" and ""Flirt"" in particular). It also feels completely
    slapped together, but in a good way, and cheats them by a year-- they were a
    band for eleven years, but that's not very snappy now, is it? In short, it's an
    almost perfect look back at the career of a duo that celebrated imperfection
    and gave a thick Scottish accent to the id of dejected barflies the
    world over. 
    </p>
<p>
    Moffat's ""singing voice"" can barely be called one-- he's not
    melodic in any usual sense, and the songs rely on the high quality of his
    lyrics and Middleton's clever arrangements. Middleton gives shape to Moffat's
    eloquent musings, combining them with unlikely textures. ""(Afternoon)
    Soaps"", for instance, pairs a slow moan about mid-day boredom, a
    sophisticated drum machine slide, and billowing ice-rink strings in a jarring
    juxtaposition. ""The Shy Retirer"" is downright danceable, with a
    pulsing beat and swelling strings to offset lines like, ""This cunted circus
    never ends,"" and, ""My eyes were rolling when we met and now they are
    preparing for attack."" 
    </p>
<p>
    The compilation includes an armload of non-album tracks, from B-sides and
    the single version of early track ""The Clearing"", which is as filthy
    sonically as it is lyrically, to the band's original 1995 demo recording of
    ""Islands"", which is sequenced to cut into the contentment of the
    opening track with a hot knife of ragged guitar and characteristic sourness.
    Listening to the live version of ""Gilded"" drives home how much these
    guys cleared the way, musically speaking, for Art Brut, with its tossed-off
    sing-speak and cranky rock 'n' roll undercarriage. 
    </p>
<p>
    The compilation seems specifically designed to remind listeners that in
    between tales of drunkenness, cheating, rejection,
    fear of rejection, and extremely unsafe sex, there was a heart of humor. ""To All a Good
    Night"" ends with a hilarious phone call to a holiday card shop, wherein
    Moffat asks the exasperated woman, ""Do you have any Easter cards with a
    Christmas theme?"" in a perfect deadpan. The band's critically acclaimed
    debut single includes a verse about being moved close to tears by an episode of
    The Simpsons, and another wherein Moffat's friend Matt recommends eating less
    cheese to prevent nightmares. 
    </p>
<p>
    But then, of course, it's always back to the band's meat and potatoes.
    B-side ""The Girl I Loved Before I Fucked"" has Moffat go from thinking
    he can be friends with an ex to wishing abortions and STDs on her in less than
    a minute. It's songs like this that I imagine led the band to break up, because
    such deep bleakness just isn't sustainable. Being so dour and dirty for so long
    must be exhausting-- you have to put yourself in a certain place mentally to
    brazenly sing a line like ""It was the biggest cock you'd ever seen""
    over nothing but an acoustic guitar. Anyway, I'm glad Moffat finally found contentment. We'll always have the lousy memories.

    Silkworm left us with nine albums, none of them awful
    or even below par. Maintaining status quo was their specialty, to the point
    where casual fans grew bored with their consistency. Such dependability is a
    tough sell from a band with no gimmicks and no real drama despite label and
    personnel shifts; they just ended up on the 'quietly invaluable' end of the Touch and Go roster's spectrum, and continued to crank out albums, surprising even themselves
    at their longevity. It took a tragic and senseless accident-- the death of
    drummer Michael Dahlquist in 2005-- to end the band's career.</p><p>
    The shadow of his
    sudden passing looms over <em>Chokes!</em>, an EP that marks the band's final
    release. But even though these recordings are salvaged from unfinished sessions
    for a now-scrapped full-length (with assists from Matt Kadane on keys), this EP achieves
    something unexpected in its own right. Tenderly nostalgic without ever taking
    itself too seriously, <em>Chokes!</em> is as good a series finale as any fan
    could hope.</p><p>
    Silkworm's final EP is meant to function as a snapshot,
    and it does that and more. The band never made any bones about its classic rock
    influences, from the attention-begging but tasteful soloing of
    guitarist/vocalist Andy Cohen to triumphant and irony-free covers of bands like
    Small Faces or Fleetwood Mac that they always managed to make their own.
    Silkworm seemed to get more and more tightly wound, though, through records
    like <em>Italian Platinum</em> and <em>It'll Be Cool</em>, where they made few
    missteps but brought fewer surprises. <em>Chokes!</em> is a much looser document
    and in turn catches some of the intangible wistfulness of the band's heroes. 
    </p>
<p>
    Nowhere is that more apparent than on opener ""Bar
    Ice"", a song as infectious as any they've recorded. There are big choruses
    in Silkworm's oeuvre, sure, but not many sing-alongs like this. Tim Midgett finds new drama in his vocals, stretching and hanging on his syllables in
    near-parody, which makes the track an even bigger breath of fresh
    air. From the lyrics in the booklet (printed opposite a requiem for Dahlquist),
    it's not hard to guess the subject matter, but this is a joyous tribute, from
    Cohen's all-out wailing (""I've been fighting my bloodline"") to even a
    silly moment of falsetto. Why these guys had never written an anthem like this before is a
    mystery to me, but it's an undeniable rush of bittersweet nostalgia. 
    </p>
<p>
    The other tracks are just as casual,
    including Midgett's vocal on ""Int'l Harbor of Grace"", which
    nearly matches the elation of ""Bar Ice"". Silkworm continue to indulge
    their classic rock jones, as ""Low Blow"" channels Neil Young in its
    crashing guitars and strained vocal, and ""Lily White &amp; Cherry Red"" is a rambling story-song that gains charm as it gradually rolls off
    the tracks. ""Wrote a Song for Everyone"" is a CCR tune recorded
    alongside the band's take on the Faces' ""Ooh La La"" for the <em>Lifestyle</em>
    sessions. Held against that other cover, you can tell it was omitted for good
    reason, but Cohen does a commendable job of channeling Fogerty's distinctive
    melody without that 90-year-old badger howl. <em>Chokes!</em> as a whole could
    stand as an epilogue to the era of the Crust Brothers and the underrated <em>Lifestyle</em>,
    an album that was more indebted to its influences but with an easy, affable
    charm and melodies that dig with time. 
    </p>
<p>
    But if all that doesn't sound like much to the
    uninitiated, it was Dahlquist-- and it's a point I hate to harp on-- that
    helped make the band unique, his stern, off-kilter behind-the-beat style giving
    their songs an otherworldly propulsion. It's also Dahlquist on vocals at the
    record's end, singing a version of ""Spanish Harlem Incident"" recorded
    live with the Crust Brothers, with only a guitar or two for accompaniment. It
    should be said that even this poignant closer doesn't feel maudlin in the
    least; rather, it feels reverent, fitting in perfectly with the feel of <em>Chokes!</em>,
    and really, with the feel of Silkworm. The record ends with more of the band
    simply honoring their heroes in their own indebted, imperfect style yet somehow

If anyone was victimized by the Strokes' retro-rock renaissance, it was a pre-millennial, post-modernist East Village music scene comprised of recombinant groups-- Soul Coughing, Luscious Jackson, Firewater, even the latter-day Jon Spencer Blues Explosion-- who mined a New York City musical heritage that went deeper than the Velvet Underground, but who had either disbanded or fallen out of critical favor by century's turn.</p><p>
    Standing at the forefront of this lost moment was Cibo Matto, two culinary-obsessed Japanese women-- Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori-- who scavenged NYC traditions from be-bop to hip-hop into riotous wok-rocking beats. But the duo's 2001 dissolution was as muted as their 1994 arrival was refreshing, and their two-album legacy remains bound to an era when the city's indie-music culture was epitomized more by Grand Royal magazine's pop-cultural kitsch than Vice's party-hard decadence. The pronounced paradigm shift in the city's rock culture has obscured just how busy the ex-Cibos have been in the interim: Honda has collaborated with everyone from Caetano Veloso to the Boredoms, while Hatori's pursuits have ranged from the deliberately low-key (Smokey &amp; Miho, an acoustic bossa nova/samba project with Beck guitarist Smokey Hormel) to the commercially ubiquitous (voicing Gorillaz character Noodle on that band's multi-platinum debut).</p><p>
    Knowledge of Hatori's back-story is a prerequisite for making sense of her first solo album, <em>Ecdysis</em>, which plays like something of a career-retrospective mash-up. Though the opening lyric suggests a clear break from her food-crazy former band (""Sentimental candies/ I put five of them/ Too many in my mouth/ My body feels some sour-ness""), the album's dreamlike ambiance (""dreamlike"" as in strange and random, not sleepy) is highly evocative of the more cerebral end of the Cibo catalogue (c.f. ""White Pepper Ice Cream""). And the experience of playing a cartoon in Gorillaz has seemingly inspired Hatori to toy with her identity. Though her thickly accented English readily identifies her as a Japanese woman, her narrative perspective is constantly shifting from female to male, from past to future, from deeply personal to nonsensical-- a malleability reflected by amorphous arrangements that mold traditional instrumentation (violins, trumpets) into burbling electro-sonics.
    </p><p>
    But it's Hatori's burgeoning interest in Tropicalia and Indian rhythms that elevates <em>Ecdysis</em>' exotic-pop fantasias above the level of mere Björkian feng shui: ""Walking City"" alternates spoken-word storytelling with propulsive, percussive choruses that split the difference between Rio and Bombay, enhancing the song's themes of dislocation and discovery; the bangin' ""Sweet Samsara Part II"" anticipates the Madonna/M.I.A. matchup that's bound to materialize sometime in the next two years. And the initial disappointment that ""Barracuda"" isn't actually a Heart cover is remedied by a seductive samba sway that's pushed askew by a tangle of organ taps, accordions, harmonica, and Hatori's Portuguese-sung pleas.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Ecdysis</em> expends most of its energy in its first two thirds, before lapsing into a closing trifecta of bossa ballads that do little more than sound pretty. But in those moments where we can hear all of Hatori's divergent influences coalescing into a harmonious whole, <em>Ecdysis</em> makes you believe that, as its maker suggests, ""anything is possible.""<br/>

    Fronted by French-born chanteuse Hélène Gautier, the Manchester-based trio Starless &amp; Bible Black create music from well within the progressive British folk-rock tradition carved by Pentangle or Fairport Convention-- they draw upon any number of intertwined traditions simultaneously. On its debut album, the group moves crisply through songs informed by Appalachian folk, downtempo jazz, Middle English pastoralism, and smoky continental balladry. Taking their name from Dylan Thomas' radio play <em>Under Milkwood</em> and not-- likely to the dismay of prog-rock zealots-- from the King Crimson album title, Starless &amp; Bible Black perform each of their stylistic shifts with an effortless agility, resulting in a collection that captivates primarily through its graceful, almost nonchalant simplicity.</p><p>
    The group's three core musicians each brings something unique to the discussion, all the better to help differentiate the group's sound in an overrun folk-rock market. Guitarist and home-studio recluse Peter Philipson plays with a clean, deftly syncretic style derived from British folk pioneers Davy Graham and Bert Jansch, quietly filling the corners of these 11 songs with his subtle brushstrokes. Gautier's appealing vocals slip almost invisibly between English and French, recalling Sandy Denny's more delicate work with Fairport as well as homespun contemporaries like Lois Maffeo or Ida's Elizabeth Mitchell. Most intriguing, however, are the contributions of multi-instrumentalist Raz Ullah, whose idiosyncratic electronic drones, tape loops, and samples supply these songs with a crucial undercurrent of drama and dissonance.</p><p>
    These elements all join to marvelous effect on the rollicking ""Everyday and Everynight"", as Gautier and Philipson's impeccable boy/girl harmonies and backcountry atmospherics are judiciously spiked with Ullah's cartoon samples and theremin. Ullah's electronic touches are more discreet, and perhaps even a little underused, on quieter tracks like ""Tredog"" or ""The Birley Tree"", with his residual analog drones offering a gentle counterpoint to the group's more formal folk structures. 
    </p>
<p>
    On several tracks the group expands to a five-piece with addition of Paul Blakesley on upright bass and Brian Edwards on drums. With this expanded line-up the group are best able to showcase their casual versatility, balancing the jazzy, nearly Tortoise-like ""b.b."" with the gorgeously lush and cryptic folk-rock of ""016-013"". These full-band pieces work well in contrast with the album's more elemental tracks, like Philipson's hypnotic instrumental ""Untitled Cantiga"" or Gautier's brilliant rendition of Billy Childish's boozy confessional ""The Bitter Cup"". This tradition-based track sounds particularly arresting from the demure Gautier, as she gives lines like ""whiskey runs through me like a sorrowful river"" a spirited and surprisingly persuasive interpretation, while still managing to sound about a million miles more put together than Childish's harrowing version. 
    </p>
<p>
    The main question that lingers for reverent folk-rock albums like <em>Starless &amp; Bible Black</em>, however, is whether the group's new classicist translations can in any way point toward the future. These musicians are each undeniably skillful folk technicians, and the album should certainly contain much to satisfy discriminating fans of the genre. And ideally, through the further integration of Ullah's electronic experiments and the sheer breadth of the full group's progressive scope, the coming years will see Starless &amp; Bible Black move their sound ever further beyond the echo chamber of mere revivalism.

    Revisiting Christian Fennesz' 2001 album <em>Endless Summer </em>six years
    later brings to mind one of my favorite single lines from a critic. In 1963,
    film writer/maker Jonas Mekas asserted in his <em>Village Voice</em> column that 8mm
    film, including amateur footage rediscovered and presented in a different
    context, was the future of the medium. He mentioned reels with sunsets casually
    shot in Arizona by vacationing New Yorkers and said that ""time is laying a
    veil of poetry over them.""</p><p>
    That notion kept running through my head while returning to this record,
    despite the different context. Time has indeed laid a veil of poetry <em>Endless
    Summer</em>, not that it needed it. It's aged very well, but there's more going
    on hearing it in 2007 than just revisiting a good record. From the beginning,
    this album was about memory, decay, and reference; it wondered how deeply an
    original idea could become distorted and still retain its content. Fennesz used
    digital bits to refract and bend ideas about warmth in pop music, and his work
    has been mellowing in history's dark cellar. Which is to say, <em>Endless Summer
    </em>sounds even better now.</p><p>
    It also sounds very 2001 somehow, and not just because it basically
    soundtracked the second half of that insane year for me. There's something
    almost naïve going on in some of these tracks, despite the music's careful
    construction. For all the guitar/computer interface we've heard since, nothing
    has sounded as naked as the simply strummed chords of the title track. They sway
    in front and force you to hear the strings and body in a new way because of
    their presence on an experimental record issued by Mego. Fennesz had it down
    conceptually. He borrowed the chords from the Sandals' 1964 instrumental
    ""Theme From the Endless Summer"" and immersed the changes in 10 feet
    of crashing water, a wall of prickly sound that drives your face into a sharp
    layer of broken seashells. And that is the entry point.
    </p>
<p>
    Even when the guitars hang back a bit and let the processing provide most of
    the texture, there is still song structure and melody. The opening ""Made
    in Hongkong"" serves as a transition from the world of his previous record,
    the striking but comparatively challenging <em>Plus Forty Seven Degrees 56'
    37"" Minus Sixteen Degrees 51' 08""</em>, meeting that blizzard of noise
    halfway with rolling chords and bits of a tune and then carrying the heavy
    stuff into this warmer, more welcoming place. ""A Year in a Minute"" is a
    canny exercise in stasis, pointing to film drama in a drone piece that seems to
    shoot beams of sound toward the sky like a rotating klieg light.
    ""Caecilia"" is as nakedly pretty as Fennesz has allowed his music to get
    to date, all delicate quivers, the feeling of excited nervousness made into
    sound. And then there are the few merely good moments that keep the original <em>Endless
    Summer </em>from perfection. The CD-skipping exercise ""Before I Leave""
    is pleasant but insubstantial, and the static-heavy, organ-driven 10-minute
    closer ""Happy Audio"" is terrific but seems to come from a slightly
    different disc. 
    </p>
<p>
    I'm not crazy about the idea of reissuing records in a new edition only a
    few years after they first come out, even if the album in question is a
    ""classic"" like this one. Fennesz, it seems, knew what he was doing
    when he designed his original track list, and the two new bonus tracks here
    won't add much to the legacy. ""Badminton Girl"", originally released in 2001 on a Fat Cat split, is quite nice but
    sounds a bit like a sketch for ""Made in Hongkong"", without the
    constant sense of change. The previously unreleased ""Endless"" is of even less consequence,
    consisting of just a quiet hum without much in the way of mood. 
    </p>
<p>
    No matter, <em>Endless Summer </em>still works fantastically well and if this
    reissue allows a few new people to enjoy it, all the better. It wasn't just
    Fennesz' artistic breakthrough, but the breakthrough for a new style of electronic
    music that found a way to channel the latest developments in software into
    something that worked the way music has always worked and had appeal beyond
    just the genre heads. It was also Pitchfork's No. 2 album of 2001, which is
    sort of amazing. The only downside is that it set the bar too high, to a place
    none of the many followers since have managed to clear.

    An interesting
    backstory can sell itself. It would be tough to invent a musician with a
    history as compelling and unlikely as that of Matthew Paul Miller, who grew up a wealthy Reformist Jew in White Plains, N.Y. He
    followed Phish on tour. He beatboxed. And somewhere along the line,
    he went through musical and religious awakenings, simultaneously
    immersing himself in the disparate but complementary worlds in
    Hasidic Judaism and reggae. He moved to Crown Heights and reinvented
    himself as Matisyahu, the world's first Hasidic reggae star. It's a
    powerful story of transformation, of finding oneself in older
    traditions. Orthodox Judaism connected Miller to a heritage thousands
    of years old. Reggae gave him a culture of apocalyptic Zionist
    imagery to draw upon. And the unprecedented combination of the two
    launched a thousand magazine profiles. With baggage like that, it's
    easy to overlook the watery, hookless cruise-ship approximation of
    reggae he's selling.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    The big problem is Matisyahu's voice, a
    flat, weedy simulation of Barrington Levy's honeyed scatter-croon. He
    floats between singing and chatting without ever
    mastering either, and there's precious little vigor or conviction in
    his washed-out tenor. His band, the abysmally named Roots Tonic,
    pretends that the past 20 years of reggae never happened,
    anchoring themselves firmly in lite-lover's rock UB40 territory and
    letting their spit-shined lilt amble on without force or direction.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    On the new quickie EP <em>No Place to Be</em>,
    Matisyahu enlists the legendary Jamaican production duo and rhythm
    section Sly &amp; Robbie and works again with downtown legend Bill Laswell, and they're good moves; the space and push of
    their production is exactly what his previous records have lacked.
    But neither Sly &amp; Robbie nor Laswell are afforded the space to  breathe or stretch out;
    they're always stuck behind Matisyahu's nice-guy singsong and Aaron
    Dugan's processed guitar noodles. A cover of the Police's ""Message
    in a Bottle"" is revelatory; it actually made a more credible reggae
    song when Sting sang it, if only because he didn't hide the searching
    desperation in his voice behind layers of Rock Star Supernova
    guitar-crunches or staple on a nonsensical and churlish toast-rant: ""There's no message in your bottle/ Emptiness, it's just hollow/
    Think the way to wake up is through sex? That's just shallow.""
    Finally, the humorless scolds of the world have a reggae star to call
    their own. But at least ""Message in a Bottle"" has an actual hook,
    more than I can say of the three rerecorded originals that make up
    the EP's first half.
    </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Three remixes make up the second half,
    and all of them at least nod in interesting directions, though none
    of them quite get there. Laswell's dub version of ""Message in a Bottle""
    has a slow, thick bassline and plenty of echo, but it never does more
    than pile on generic dub signifiers. The Small Stars remix of ""Youth""
    cannily layers a tooting melodica over a half-decent drum-shuffle rap
    beat, finally granting Matisyahu some propulsion. It's the Swisha
    House Mix of ""Jerusalem"", though, that offers the most intriguing
    and unexpected hybrid, as Houston rap kingpin DJ Michael Watts slows
    the track down to a crawl, giving the beats enough space to resonate
    and giving the track a sense of psychedelic openness. Even at
    half-speed, though, Matisyahu's voice doesn't sound deep. It'll take
    more than a personal transformation to turn a jam-band kid into an
    avenging prophet.

    Jeez, call PAS/CAL a summery indie pop group <em>one</em> time, and frontman
    Casimer Pascal goes braying to the alt-weeklies how you're a ""fucking
    idiot."" Sure, we've all poked plenty of forks in toasters, but in this
    case the facts have a definite anti-me bias: Pascal, with drummer LTD, has
    played in an Amon Düül II-influenced space-rock band. <em>Dear Sir</em>, the last
    in PAS/CAL's current EP trilogy,<em> </em>shares its title with bar-living
    indie-rock queen Cat Power's 1995 debut. The new record's cover, designed by
    Asobi Seksu art-doer Sean McCabe, harkens back to a 1974 release by Apple
    softies Badfinger.</p><p>
    Hmm, last one's pretty indie pop. Either way, <em>Dear Sir</em> sees PAS/CAL
    carrying their elaborate auteur-pop still further outside the reverently
    unfancy Voxtrot or Math &amp; Physics Club library. In an era where Ford's CEO
    meets with Toyota's chairman to seek advice, this Motor City septet craft songs
    with, ahem, classic design and postmodern sheen-- like 00s pop/rock misfit Bleu
    if he'd fixated more on ""Walk Away Renee"" and <em>Tago Mago</em> than <em>Glass
    Houses</em>. With inventively multi-layered songwriting, toothpaste-ad sparkly
    harmonies, and nifty arrangements to rival Jellyfish or Jon Brion, <em>Dear Sir</em>
    raises the stakes for PAS/CAL's long-awaited full-length debut, out later this
    year.</p><p>
    Despite their quest for grandma-pleasing pop, PAS/CAL don't shy away from
    artiness. On ""C.A.U. (Sans Muscle)"", the eponymous Pascal's
    impossible, Timberlake-must-be-envious falsetto peals the story of a
    serious-faced woman in military garb, as brisk acoustic guitar, choir-room
    piano, and a few shouting children go merrily round a <em>Village Green</em>. The
    title track, a Krautrock jam with madly panning da-da backing vocals, is merely
    the most outlandish song in a catalog that also includes schizophrenic sock hop
    slow dance ""What Do the American Girls Have on Jennifer Jo Jo?"" (from
    2004's <em>Oh Honey, We're Ridiculous </em>EP). Even when superfluous, the
    courage to experiment helps keep PAS/CAL's studied retroisms from sounding
    rote. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not to say the band can't also pen ditties that should rub their hometown's
    obsolescent garage-bozo rep off the map (is this where I rip on that ass booger
    Jack White?). Fuzzed-organ headbopper ""Little Red Radio"" slips in a
    local DJ reference and was apparently inspired by Stereolab, but it's the only
    Christmas list you'll still want to hear in, well, yeah, the summer. ""Wake
    Up Wake Up Wake Up"" was commissioned for a Matthew McConaughey flick, a
    surprise because this multipart-vocal call to action sounds like a box office
    winner. Female singer Bem takes a droll lead turn on ""The Lot We Came Home
    With""-- Glasgow's Camera Obscura through a kaleidoscope. Aw snap, a sticker
    blurb: <em>Dear Sir</em> is cake to enter, yet labyrinthine enough to explore on
    repeat. Hey, I <em>am</em> a fucking idiot.

    The grand gesture has always been a friend of Jeremy Enigk.
    His former band Sunny Day Real Estate squeezed every ounce of available drama
    into its songs and his vocals would push at the edge of their range as if
    hoping to find some other form of expression just on the other side. These days
    he seems more comfortable with restraint, and he sounds more in command when he
    hits the occasional John Anderson high note, but he still opens his second solo
    album (his first was almost 10 years ago, when SDRE were still a thing) with
    about as grand and dramatic a moment as he's ever committed to tape.</p><p>
    ""A New Beginning"" is just a minute-and-a-half intro track,
    but it's stuffed to the gills with strings, ringing bells, and cymbal
    crashes that make the title seem right. It certainly signals a break with his
    old band-- going back 14 years to the first SDRE album, it's an entirely
    different animal, a crashing, thudding rock album where this new one is
    basically sophisticated adult pop with some prog kicking around the edges.</p><p>
    That description is never truer than when he opens ""City
    Tonight"" by asking, ""Am I late to the Kingdom of Love?""
    The song has a synth-pop undercurrent ballasting the verses, but it's all
    sweeping rock after the first few minutes, with Enigk multi-tracking himself
    and casting his voice into a well of reverb. Enigk's vocals get their biggest workout on ""Damien
    Dreams"", an interesting modal song full of hanging phrases that never feel
    resolved. He conjures up a hell of a growl in the middle of the song without
    sounding strained, but the track's most engaging moment comes when he provides a strange vocal harmony for himself on just one line-- an inventive technique to draw your attention to the lyric. 
    </p>
<p>
    The orchestral grandeur of the album intro sloshes to the surface
    throughout the album, poking up most prominently in the drifting title track. ""Dare
    a Smile"" opens with an acoustic guitar playing a chord sequence you've heard in
    at least a couple of hundred songs, touched with a bit of mandolin, and as the
    string pads come in it starts to sound like some sort of alternate universe
    James Bond theme.
    </p>
<p>
<em>World Waits</em> is a
    naturally big-sounding album from a guy who's spent a career trying different
    ways to make something this assured. It's an overwhelmingly agreeable record, if
    one that's not always gripping-- with few exceptions I feel like Enigk is
    performing with a net here, falling back on big production when the composition
    isn't all the way there. But this does mean he never really falls too flat, and
    the craft is certainly there in most of these songs. I get the sense from listening
    that it's exactly the record he wanted to make, and it's likely all of his old
    SDRE fans who graduated from their emo phases along with him will feel right at home.

Knows his way around a sequencer, cobbles crazy sounds into beats that only crazy people could possibly rap over (so, basically just MF Doom), has a moniker that looks ill stenciled on a crate. But damn, is someone running a wildly popular Modern Instrumental Hip-Hop workshop now? Does it have a monopsonistic chokehold on a host of beleaguered factories that produce big, brightly colored slabs of <em>BEAT®</em> at an ever more frantic clip to stay afloat against low fees and high demand? Is Dabrye not only the company's president, but a client?</p><p>
    I like squelchy bass, ray-gun trills, clever drum programming, and wobbly keyboards as much as the next guy who used to be really into Anticon, and I respect the polished craft that keeps <em>1983</em> shucking along. But like an overly workshopped novel, the album is stylish, well-turned, and interchangeable with its peers. Seldom bad, seldom memorable, Flying Lotus's IDM-influenced hip-hop is paint-by-numbers. That's not necessarily negative, but I prefer music that's willing to strategically violate the terms of its genre in order to make an impression. This stuff bangs, but with a cerebral bent-- splitting that difference dilutes its impact, and a more discernible human charisma would go a long way toward distinguishing it.</p><p>
    At least the paint is often garish and skillfully applied enough to distract from the faint template beneath it, and the eclectic style keeps outright tedium at bay. The title track's rubbery space-funk gets whipped into an electro-pop froth on a remix by Daedelus, marking the first time that Daedelus's presence has ever made anything <em>less </em>boring. The moist, glassy stabs of ""Bad Actors"" are nicely offset by the clicky, pitch-bending corkscrews of ""Orbit Brazil"" and the idyllic sheen of ""Untitled #7"". The stuttering creeper ""Pet Monster Shotglass"" jerkily mutates for upwards of six-minutes, demonstrating by example what much of the album wants for-- a sense of compositional completion and deliberate evolution that's missing from more static ideas like ""Hello"", which humps an ice-blue synth swirl into attractive anonymity.
    </p><p>
    Those of you looking for a good genre exercise will find plenty to admire on <em>1983</em>. The boom always baps right on time (which is to say, slightly off-time). The herky is extra jerky, but not to the extent of disrupting a good head-nod. Each obstinate loop eventually starts to hiccup and convulse, which is how you know it's art. The rest of you will turn off this album wondering why you can't remember any details from it, and why you suddenly feel the urge to shop for a minivan.

    A few dozen ""2006: Year of You"" think pieces later, we know a lot about ""You"": Web 2.0 has democratized the media, caught the eye of corporations from Silicon Valley to Detroit, and sparked <u><a href=""http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38853/Jet_Shine_On"" title=""Jet: Shine On review"">new ways to call 'em as we see 'em</a></u>. However, the rise of user-generated content has also accelerated the conversion of gestalt experience into symbolic form-- most basically, 1's and 0's-- and something usually gets lost in this translation. If I'm busy recording a moment, how can I be fully present in it? What most defines our lives nearly always defies documentation.</p><p>
    No wonder Sweden's Sally Shapiro prefers to keep her offline self to herself. Shapiro reputedly declines to be photographed by strangers, and she, like 1980s Italo disco singer Valerie Dore, records under an English pseudonym. (Shapiro hasn't told us her real name, and she doesn't do interviews-- if ""she"" exists at all.) Just six months ago, songwriter/producer Johan Agebjörn started posting on message boards announcing her debut 12"" ""I'll Be By Your Side""-- Pitchfork's #27 track of 2006. Not since <em>Tigermilk</em>-era Belle and Sebastian has an artist gotten so much publicity from refusing to do publicity. Here, as then, such reticence befits the music, which speaks, sensitively and eloquently, for itself.</p><p>
    ""I'll Be By Your Side"" returns to open Shapiro's first full-length, <em>Disco Romance</em>. Like <em>Tigermilk</em>'s ""The State I Am In"", it's an auspicious introduction to an, ohhh, introverted world. Agebjörn's Italo-inspired tracks build gradually, drop melodies that could melt whatever global warming leaves behind, and then hold on for dear life. Shapiro's guileless vocals put an angelic face on her producer's melancholy, but she, too, is clinging to the past. <em>Disco Romance</em> is deeply nostalgic. It's the nostalgia of someone who has loved and lost and knows damn well it was indeed ""better""-- no matter how gnawing the present hurt.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
    Sure, Italo's comeback has been here for years. Just ask Morgan Geist, Alec DeRuggiero, Hans-Peter Lindstrøm, or Mrs. Guy Ritchie. Fundamentally a modern indie pop album (dig the cover art's references to old Heavenly and Field Mice design schemes), <em>Disco Romance</em> uses its sonic heritage not so much as a blueprint as for thematic material. Though German label ZYX Music didn't coin the term until 1983, Italo disco began when the strings, horns, and sweaty glitz of the Village People, K.C. &amp; the Sunshine Band, or ""Disco Duck"" gave way to something new: an electronic-based amalgam of throbbing bass lines, aching synth arpeggios, and low-tech drum thuds. Like 80s house or 90s lo-fi, the genre that sprang almost fully formed from Giorgio Moroder's knobs, via Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"", was cheap and easy to imitate. 
    </p>
<p>
    In Agebjörn's hands, Italo is also essentially sad: Perhaps the first dance music made in solitude. ""I'll Be By Your Side"" draws its emotional depth from the way the arrangement implicitly contradicts Shapiro's vows of eternal togetherness. Detouring into intergalactic lounge, ""I Know"" shows its lonely narrator's struggle to go on believing those promises. If Shapiro really <em>knows</em>, then why does she have to keep telling herself so-- why are those squiggly synth solos so tragic? ""Just tell me how I can hold onto this moment for now,"" she asks. The key changes, bass dives, and our moment extends for another two minutes. 
    </p>
<p>
    Back on paper, the album<em> </em>should be as giddy as it makes Pitchfork HQ. After all, Agebjörn's love-oriented songs mostly polish up the simple, frequently nonsensical lyrics of classic Italo. ""Be mine in the sunshine,"" Shapiro sings on ""Hold Me So Tight"", but it's beneath a deluge of rainy-day synths. Even on ""Anorak Christmas"", a cover of Swedish twee-poppers Nixon, Shapiro sings the words ""please don't go away"" as if she doesn't plan to be heard. ""Find My Soul"" reaches out a trembling hand, and ambient lullaby ""Sleep in My Arms"" is as desolate as a <em>Star Trek</em> captain's log.  <em>Disco Romance </em>turns the Smiths' happy-music-with-sad-lyrics formulation on its head-- and then you <em>dance</em> to it. 
    </p>
<p>
    Yep, style is ephemeral. Agebjörn can't bring back vanished innocence by recreating the sounds of our youth any more than Shapiro can keep love alive just by saying the words. They can, however, control the emotional experience of anyone who has ears-- now, and as long as their songs remain available in some form. <em>Disco Romance</em> takes history's revision process into its own hands with two remixes, one a slick ""Norwegian electrojazz"" take on ""Find My Soul"" and the other Netherlands electro artist Rude66's vocoder-ghostly, acid-squelched ""I'll Be By Your Side"" revamp. They're not new songs, but they provide another means of prolonging the present. 
    </p>
<p>
    The Web's cacophony privileges criticism. You won't find God in scriptural commentaries, or save any children watching <em>Hotel Rwanda</em>, but you <em>can</em> fall in love to ""My Love"" (in theory). If verbalization is inherently reductive, then writing about music is a way to encode the moment loss-free. The track always endures. In his book <em>Air Guitar</em>, MacArthur Fellowship-winning arts critic Dave Hickey explains: ""Even though my writing about art might momentarily intervene between some object and its beholders, the words would wash away, and the writing, if it was written successfully into its historical instant, could never actually <em>replace </em>the work or banish it into the realm of knowledge."" All that lasts is music; Shapiro and Agebjörn know.

Though the label has released great collections of Panamanian funk and free jazz obscurities and primeval New York hip-hop and glittering and gaudy Tom Moulton disco mixes and chilly Brazilian post-punk and early acid house and sweet Philly soul (you get the idea), they're perhaps best known for their devotion to Jamaican music, from ska to, now, ragga. Most of their Studio One series of compilations, collating a variety of themed cuts from the venerable reggae label, are worth owning, and they've put out a string of solid single artist LPs. But the label's most seductive point of entry to Jamaican music has been their <em>100% Dynamite</em> series, a mix of tunes almost anyone with a cursory interest in reggae knows and a few deep pocket obscurities to keep heads scratching.</p><p>
    Ragga had shown up on the <em>100% Dynamite</em> records since the third installment where Wayne Smith's epochal 1980s burial tune ""Under Mi Sleng Teng"" bumped up against dub cuts from the late 70s and ska from the 60s; later installments featured Bounty Killer, Red Rat, Tiger Ranks refixing ""The Real Slim Shady"", and a 21st century version of ""Under Mi Sensi"". But <em>Dynamite! Dancehall Style</em> is the first Soul Jazz compilation to feature exclusively dancehall, stretching from pre-digital deejay chat tunes to modern computer-assisted, hip-hop-saturated gangsta records to a few non-Jamaican mutations. All mixed up non-chronologically, of course-- a cross-generational and cross-continental meeting of the minds.</p><p>
    For modern dancehall fans accustomed to sparklingly recorded handclaps, Burundi drums, country banjos, psychedelicized ProTools touches, and 3D gunshots, the hissy, lo-fi production on many <em>Dynamite! Dancehall Style</em> cuts may take a few spins to acclimate to. Early B's ""Boombox"" and Dillinger's ""Dubplate Pirate"" were recorded with inelastic drum machines and dippity-doo keyboard basslines-- born with ""Sleng Teng"" and its 1985 Casio approximation of a rolling Eddie Cochran guitar riff-- with their producers playing around with the echo knobs and layering vocals up and down in the background. Even beefed up on Powerman's 2003 ""Right Yah So"", that ""Sleng Teng"" bassline is charmingly cheesy, totally infectious, and cartoonishly effective as a hook.
    </p><p>
    Like Mantronix-era hip-hop, this stuff still sounds great. (Especially since I wasn't there at the time to experience either.) On the chorus of Anthony ""Red"" Rose's ""Tempo""-- one of the big smashes from a revitalized, digital-era King Tubby-- the producer throws crude digital reverb on the singjay's voice, making Rose sound some o.g. ""Battlestar Gallactica"" villain over an ultra-minimal riddim. (And dig how much of a delicious reverbed smack Tubby gets out of his rigid mechanical drums on the later ""Fade Out"".) That kind of ticking hypnosis is all over the earliest cuts on <em>Dynamite! Dancehall Style</em>, as producers who were well versed with swirling human drummers through the echo chamber relearned their trade on boxes with little in the way of give or swing or sway. Even the newer cuts, like Lady Saw's 2003 ""Mi Ting Deh""-- recorded in an era where garage bands use Garage Band-- keep things spare and deadly. And as for the British interlopers, the shuddering, shivering synthetic bassline on dubsteppers Digital Mystikz's ""Earth a Run Red"" owes as much to ""Sleng Teng"" as it does to Wiley's ""Igloo"" and ""Blizzard"". (For instrumentals, though, the Mystikz are unsurprisingly cut here by reggae legend Sly Dunbar's steel drum-driven ""Wake the Town"" and eerie ""Assault Rifle."")
    </p>
<p>
    Likewise, the deejaying on many of the cuts may sound archaic at first, taking off on the biddly-zunga-zanga-bong style of onomatopoeic scat pioneered by chatters like Barrington Levy, Eek-A-Mouse, and Yellowman or the almost peaks-and-valleys-free delivery of early digital deejays, sounding like they're trying to out John Henry their drum machines. Pompidou's ""Governor General"" opens with the croaky-voiced MC repeating ""general"" about 15 times in a row, as well as devoting special attention to how he can juggle the words ""jiggly-iggly"" (or is it ""iggly-jiggly""?) and gargling other phrases a few dozen times each. (At least that's what I hear.) Robert Christgau may have said that Kleenex/Lilliput had the best collection of vocal nonsensicals since doo-wop but dancehall deejays might give the Swiss ladies a run for their money. In contrast, Shinehead's slow, skanking, reverential take on MJ's ""Billie Jean"" feels slightly out of place here, maybe only ""dancehall"" by dint of having been released in the '80s. That inclusion and a few other tracks mean that as any sort of dancehall primer, <em>Dynamite! Dancehall Style</em> is too flighty and a bit too obscure in places to really work, but as a kick-ass mixtape put together by your cool, in-the-know friends at Soul Jazz, it's pretty much a treat from end to end.<br/>

    In the late 1990s, experimental electronic music seemed to
    develop in parallel with Moore's Law. As computers grew more powerful and
    software more sophisticated, texture began to trump all, and subgenres sprouted
    from every newly programmed patch. We heard in music the sound of technology at
    the precise moment of a record's creation. A lot of great music was made, and a
    lot more that'll never be heard again. But sometimes it seemed as though
    the machines were in charge; there was a tremendous amount of complexity for
    complexity's sake.</p><p>
    Thinking about those days while listening to Polish-born and Cologne-based
    producer Paul Wirkus is instructive. As experimental electronic music goes,
    Wirkus' work is very simple. A given track might have two or three distinct
    tones that are introduced, layered, tweaked, and mixed in varying proportions, and
    then allowed to vanish into silence. But Wirkus possesses a natural ear
    and a disciplined sense of structure. Everything happens when it should, and
    these miniatures of basic, controlled sound wind up being tremendously
    affecting.</p><p>
    I can't help but think of the opening ""View Finder"" as a sly
    homage to Giorgio Moroder, another auteur with a gift for economy. The
    repeating synth driving the track reminds me of what it might sound like to be
    under a couple of feet of water as a helicopter hovers just above the surface, and
    then the gently modulating synths lean in with the same flanged drama Moroder
    deployed to telegraph the climaxes of ""I Feel Love"". But it isn't pop
    music Wirkus is making; it's not even cinematic, exactly. It's too abstract for
    that, and draws too much attention to its constituent qualities. It sounds like
    electricity arranging itself into interesting shapes, not like a background for
    something else.
    </p>
<p>
    Every once in a while the music drifts into a static-ridden realm that could
    be overly familiar to those who burned out on Mille Plateaux even before the
    label disintegrated; but even tracks like the hissy, trembling ""Dogs After
    Flight"" and the steam-tunnel drone of ""Erineru"" have flashes of
    melody and change considerably over their relatively brief running times, so
    they hold up well to repeated listens. As on his previous record, <em>Inteletto
    d'Amore</em>, Wirkus again has a track with subtle vocals; ""Nie
    Kocham"" has barely whispered Polish chopped into pieces and moved through
    space in and around columns of repeating bass, fostering a very odd affective
    space that's both creepy and sad.
    </p>
    The
    record as a whole can be summed up by taking in the power of
    ""Kocham"", which begins with meager ingredients indeed: just a
    stereotypically ""electronic"" palette that's been around since the
    score to <em>Forbidden Planet</em> and a handful of notes that seem to float in
    space randomly. And yet, somehow, it manages to put a lump in my throat. It's
    difficult to convey the subtle beauty of the best tracks on <em>Déformation
    Professionnelle</em>; all I can say is that Wirkus has some sort of weird gift
    that'll likely become more apparent over time.</div>"|9743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9743-deformation-professionnelle/|7.9|Mark Richardson

Compliments like ""focused"" and ""patient"" may sound backhanded, but it's the band's brand of tunnel vision that elevates its third album <em>Working Nine to Wolf</em> from stale post-grunge to a notable release in its career.</p><p>
    True, you may hear nothing but tired blues-scale hammering and sludgy distortion on opener ""Parade of Horribles"", and I'll grant that this is the one track on <em>Working Nine to Wolf</em> that's a few minutes too long-- with a forced vocal and the uninspired guitar diddling that closes its 13th minute. But to dismiss them out of hand for playing familiar tropes and playing them sluggishly would be ignoring the record's <em>raison d'etre</em>: To take these classic riffs and stretch and tease them with the deliberate pacing stolen from bands like Mogwai, giving these straightforward  guitar workouts a graceful, epic feel without sacrificing melody or structure.</p><p>
    The masterplan is more apparent on ""She Destroys the Light"", a gentle undistorted pluck over padded drums and splashes of hi-hat that unexpectedly bursts out with a staccato sing-along. Every hammer on-and-off in ""Mask Tree"" is deliberate and rich with melody, burrowing into the memory from first listen. Pacing and tunefulness come together best on ""Polly Gray"", the album's most immediate track-- one that lumbers and croons at the same time. Simple but hypnotic drums anchor ""Broadcast All Your Dreams"", and the throaty anthem ""Decide on the Double Cross"" could be your favorite Guided By Voices single slowed to 33 1/3.
    </p><p>
    The record may sound overly familiar, but no part of <em>Working Nine To Wolf</em> is lazy. If anything, this record is too uptight, too exact in its arrangements and too tightly-plotted in their songs; the record is often unpredictable, but never very loose. Well-tread riffs and occasionally bland vocals were red flags at first listen, but rather than looking outside for new textures, Pinebender put their head down and burrowed ""forward, forward, forward,"" as singer Chris Hanson wails on ""Broadcast All Your Dreams"". Surprisingly, their insistence pays off.

    At one point on <em>Parasiticide</em>, Sherry Fraser gets at the heart Two Ton Boa, her long-running but low-output rock outfit, like so: ""It's a one woman show."" So goes the deliberately titled ""Herarchy""; it sums up her up outfit. Whether or not you know her band's back story-- 1999's debut EP and its warm critical reception, the ensuing years of bipolar disorder and staunched creativity, the recent tentative return-- its weight is easily felt throughout <em>Parasiticide</em>. The album, released last year, begins with an unforgiving bass grind and a blunt declaration: ""Something's cracked/ Inside/ Like the liberty bell.""</p><p>
    Fraser makes deeply unhappy music and employs very little art to disguise that fact. Though Two Ton Boa is ostensibly a full band-- at least in the studio, and on the road-- Fraser writes the songs, plus the parts for every instrument; to listen to one of her records is to enter very much into her headspace. This is uncomfortable. Her lyrics are blunt and awkward, the music follows suit-- all low register bass and toms, no guitar, and no relief from the plodding slow tempo she employs on every song. <em>Parasiticide</em>'s few flourishes are equally gothic: protesting cello plucks, church-carnival ghostly organ, one bass pattern laid solidly over another.</p><p>
    There is no interaction or interplay to speak of on <em>Parasiticide</em>. So though the band's rumbling palate and dual bass charge might sound like Noxagt or godheadSilo or any other economic, bass-heavy band, Two Ton Boa's songs have groove but they don't, for any reason, <em>move</em>. When, on ""Cyanide"", Fraser lets loose with a playful ""o-o-o-o-o-oh,"" it's mostly just more percussion; you know it came off the page that way. No fewer than three songs-- ""Herarchy"", ""Gumshoe"", and ""Bad Seed""-- start with formalist schoolyard rhymes and chants, the kind of thing kids skip rope to or use to mock one another. This is a pattern that Fraser grows up rather than relinquishes-- her songs are proscribed, tight around the edges on purpose. 
    </p>
<p>
    Some of this emerges from a strong strain of feminism: The transposition of the classically girly or feminine into art. The rest of it is revenge: Fraser pulls out the venom and casual cruelty embedded in these catechisms and spits it back. Sure enough, the rhyme will drop away and Fraser will swagger in, intoning accusations as she arrives: ""<em>That's you</em>!"" 
    </p>
<p>
    So <em>Parasiticide</em> is moving but also intimidating and repulsive-- Fraser's work is all rough edges. There's the vocabulary-- there is no possible way to enjoy the line ""You always obfuscate/ With your mendacious games"" quite as much as she does-- the unrelenting depression, and the musical base, pushy and awkward as it is. Call it riot grrl or goth or, as one previous reviewer in these pages did, Evanescence-- it's not easy going. Fraser's new record is tough to love but easy to respect, a deal she's likely proud to offer.

    Once upon a time, all country singers aspired to play the Grand Ole
    Opry. Or at least that's what Robert Altman taught me. Today, even
    though the Opry has sunk to a C-list country music channel and hocked
    itself as the setting for a reality TV show, some of the luster of the
    old red barn backdrop still remains. But for the lowly denizens of the
    alt-country world, a performance at the Opry remains far out of reach.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, Neko Case almost made herself into prime material for
    a Disney underdog biopic by defying these odds, drawing an invite to an
    Opry-related event (if not the actual stage) in 2002. Alas, the
    potential for her to be triumphantly portrayed by Julia Roberts was
    squandered at that same event, when she was ceremoniously banned from
    the Grand Ole for shirtlessness-- a piece of lore that appeared,
    usually in exaggerated form, as the wacky story in every Case profile
    until her infamous <em>Playboy</em>
    poll victory (""Sexiest Babe of Indie Rock"", April 2003). Whatever the
    saucy details, Case must now settle for the same minor-league version
    of the Opry as her peers, the Austin-based and PBS-supported Austin City Limits.</p><p>
    Not that ACL is anything to scoff at; the show has seen
    hundreds of artists give intimate soundstage performances gentle and
    non-threatening enough to fit between Jim Lehrer and ""Nova"". Case's unimpeachable combination of cred and rootsy traditionalism would seem to make her obvious programming for this timeslot. But Case as a performer is a less-than-perfect tenant for the Austin skyline, as reflected by this August 2003 live set which comprises the latest installment in the Austin City Limits CD/DVD series.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    On her prior live album, <em>The Tigers Have Spoken</em>, Case
    sounded at home in the boozier environment of the rock club, trading
    licks and harmonies with members of the Sadies on originals and
    spiritual covers. Here, Case chooses a stripped-down band-- only banjo
    or slide and bass accompanying her rhythm guitar-- and the show's
    producers oblige by mixing her voice twice as loud as any other
    instrument present in the recording. Locking the spotlight on Case's
    vocoder-flexible, mousse-rich voice is the obvious directorial call,
    but so sparse an approach undercuts her less-touted gifts as a
    songwriter, draining the texture out of tracks like ""Outro With Bees""
    and ""Knock Loud"" and leaving only half-finished husks behind. This
    doesn't apply to every track-- no amount of minimalism can
    dispel the dramatic fog that pervades ""Deep Red Bells"" or ""Furnace Room
    Lullaby""-- but minus the cavernous reverb and home-recorded coziness of
    her recorded work, Case can only rely on her flair for disturbing digression (the gory deer-dream of ""Favorite"") to add a
    creepily unique edge to what passes for love songs in her songbook.
    </p>
<p>
    Unsurprisingly then, the ACL soundstage sounds more natural on the
    covers Case chooses, be it folk standard ""Wayfaring Stranger"" or Bob
    Dylan's ""Buckets of Rain"". Even Lisa Marr's ""In California""-- as
    textbook a TV drama soundtrack song as I've ever heard-- is improved by Case's gentle reading, taming her vocal weaponry just
    enough to avoid drowning the song's melancholy in slippery notes and
    twang. That voice, that voice, that voice; so technically sharp and
    character-rich, it keeps hogging the attention, especially in this
    empty environment.
    </p>
<p>
    Where her recorded work uses shadowy mood and ragged edges to
    evade any diva accusations and make her albums safe for those who
    listen to ""everything but country,"" the Austin City Limits
    performance finds her playing her talents straight. While Case's voice
    may have been her ticket to the Opry, this record is proof that, even
    in more humble surroundings, it's unsatisfying to hear her lean too

    phaser Liz Harris (aka Grouper) and Xiu Xiu situates itself at the core
    of the former's chilly drone and the windiest outskirts of the latter's saddest
    ballads. The EP's five tracks share similar pacing and a narrowly defined sound; subtly defined
    gradations emerge across the 20-some minute tapestry, but the participants contentedly explore a limited palette.  (Befitting its
    brevity, the album-- part of Slender Means Society and
    States Rights Records' Pregnancy Series-- was originally pressed in a limited
    edition of 700 copies.)</p><p>
    The effort's understated approach and overall sense of faceless anonymity creates something unique to the participants, but the results are definitely more Grouper than Xiu Xiu. Most obviously,  Jamie
    Stewart's vocal angst and bruised lyrics never emerge from their darkest-corner hiding place. Instead, he finds ways to emote via autoharp, percussion, and the refracted/treated vocal samples of Xiu Xiu parter Caralee McElroy. Harris sings, plays pianos, adds guitar, and on her MySpace page she writes, ""We both had immense terror of
    terror films when we were children and was in lathe of these feelings
    that we explored the subjects of the record."" Then it's by design that<em> Creepshow</em>, composed through a back-and-forth correspondence, builds an
    alternate soundtrack-- not one for a surround-sound cinematic experience, but an
    internal score charting pulses.</p><p>
    That said, the
    title ostensibly references an actual film: <em>Creepshow</em>, Stephen King and George
    Romero's kitschy blend of screams and Crypt Keeper guffaws. There was
    a franchise series and bad HBO run, but the one I remember, rather hazily, from my own
    childhood included rafting teenagers inhaled by a blob and a bloodied hitchhiker
    muttering a snappy catchphrase (""thanks for the ride, lady"") to the woman who
    smashed into him. You laugh through the goose bumps.
    </p><p>
    This
    <em>Creepshow</em>'s muted-- even gentle. ""Waiting for the Flies"" musters Fursaxa wind-tunnel spook with a tender  melancholia that romantically bobs in the breeze. ""Growing Into
    Veins""'s slight morse code percussion,
    piano, and drifting female vocals are both ghostly and plaintively hopeful. Traversing a noisier realm, ""In the
    City"" pivots with a slide whistle, radiant feedback crumble, and someone male (or octave-controlled female) singing underwater, recalling vintage 1990s Bugskull and their hushed, psychedelic PDX tape manipulation. On ""Sea"", female vocals gurgle over kinetic steel drum pots'n'pans that make a chiming Xela-style clatter-- the
    voices are lower than the surrounding drum ring, but nothing's ever
    oppressive or pointed. It soothes. Likewise, a swooshing comfort zone introduces ""In
    Dreams""-- then, harmonium or accordion or harmonica (or whatever) strains and bubbles as higher tones ice skate along the inside of a Labradford-embossed
    wine glass. It possesses its own scissoring heartbeat.
    </p>
<p>
    The outing's an intensely concentrated set-- a finely tuned wraith that
    passes
    through the room for a second and then roams elsewhere. Often barely there, or caught between a few worlds, it has a tendency
    to disappear mid-flight: Pauses before/after
    most tracks can be pregnant, empty, or nervy squeezeboxes. Moving
    toward a climax (real or anti, depending on the listener's disposition), the largest gap drops unexpectedly at the end
    of the record as an unnamed 23:48 of nothing, a blank track mirroring the earlier
    sounds with total silence. It's like a well-paced horror film: You keep
    waiting for something to jump out-- tape hiss? creaking floorboard? Stewart shouting ""boo""?-- and most of your shivers are the result of that nervous anticipation.

    Looks like I'm not the only one making daily visits to cuteoverload.com.
    Lullatone's fourth album, <em>Plays Pajama Pop Pour Vous</em>, coaxes its bass
    drum sounds from a pillow. One half of the Nagoya, Japan-based duo, Shawn James Seymour pulls naptime melodies out of thin air, while Yoshimi Tomida whispers about
    little birds, waking up, and castles in the sky. In the tradition of
    Kyoto-based producer Nobukazu Takemura, whose Childisc label released their
    2003 sophomore effort <em>My Petit Melodies</em>, Lullatone papier-mâché the
    childlike sounds of bell-tone synths and toy glockenspiel into imaginative,
    minimalist pop.</p><p>
    Gentle sine waves
    bounce repetitively throughout sleepy-eyed opener ""Good Morning
    Melody"" and yawning synth exercise ""Magical..."", drifting across
    unhurried rhythms. It's as if they might evaporate altogether when you open
    your eyes. Eight-minute finale ""Floating Away"", with an ideal beat for a slumberland discotheque, uses stereo trickery to create the illusion
    that reclining headphone listeners are beginning to hover. But then, the defining sensation
    of <em>Plays Pajama Pop Pour Vous</em> is weightlessness.</p><p>
    Nonetheless, Lullatone can't neatly be filed alongside such kinder-pop acts
    as the Boy Least Likely To or Architecture in Helsinki. <em>Plays Pajama Pop
    Pour Vous</em> is interested not so much in being cute as in being cute <em>majestically.</em>
    Ukulele-driven ""Bedroom Bossa Nova"" exalts its simple melody and
    lyrics by letting us gaze at them from a sweeping vista of tropicalia, toy
    drums, and meticulously breezy production. The glistening harp loops of
    ""Sleepytime Samba"" spread out beneath warm beeps and blips with the
    fragile grandeur of Múm. OK, whistle-led ""Pajama Party Pop"" could
    almost be Hot Chip for the seventh-birthday crowd. So cute. 
    </p>
<p>
    At the same time, Lullatone's latest represents a progression for the duo.
    Little by little, their project has become more organic as well as more
    indebted to Tomida's girlish vocals, which feature on each of the new album's
    eight tracks. Where 2003 debut <em>Computer Recital</em> sought simple beauty in
    abstract electronics, <em>Plays Pajama Pop Pour Vous</em> finds the abstract in
    beautifully simple songs. These days Lullatone overload on aesthetic traits
    frequently viewed as puerile, and they find in them something transcendent. In
    the world of Seymour and Tomida, cuteness is merely beauty of another kind.

    Bubblegum pop and popcorn horror have more in common
    than namesakes that end up beneath movie-theater seats. Beyond the critical
    disdain heaped on each genre, both the music and the movies are drawn to the
    clichés of rock 'n' roll-era American teenagerhood: innocent girls, bad boys,
    proms, and the occasional bloody knife murder. In the 1980s, UK bands like the
    Jesus and Mary Chain violated girl-group song structures with feedback, while
    downtown New York was moving beyond slasher flicks to what actor Nick Zedd
    called ""the cinema of transgression.""</p><p>
    The Manhattan Love Suicides take their name from
    director Richard Kern's lo-fi 1985 short films, one of which starred Zedd in a
    gender-bending nymphomaniac dual role. This Leeds foursome's
    fuzzed-out dream-pop recalls not only JAMC, but also the willowy female
    vocals of C86 alumni the Shop Assistants. However, rather than revive the
    sexualized gore of the 80s movie underground-- or the black-leather tropes of
    recent retro noise-poppers like the Raveonettes-- the Manhattan Love Suicides'
    self-titled debut throbs with the giddy vulnerability of the scene that the NME's
    C86 compilation helped spawn.</p><p>
    The contrast between the haze of violent guitar noise
    and the tender pop sentiments just barely audible beneath gives the album its
    underlying tension. Appropriately, opener ""Things You've Never Done""
    is at once a kiss-off and an escape. Between blistering put-downs, singer
    Caroline McChrystal tells a soon-to-be-ex, ""I'll cross the miles off as I
    speed into a brand new life for me/ Who knows just what will happen next?""
    From there, the band's shimmying feedback rush carries our protagonist through
    lonely mornings (""Crush Whatever""), downcast drinking sessions
    (""Negative Push""), rampages against no-good boys (""The Evil
    Side""), and third-person tales of other love-wracked girls (""Suzy
    Jones""), all while piling on copious la-la-las, do-do-dos, and handclaps-- the transgressions of
    twee. 
    </p>
<p>
    McChrystal and guitarist Darren Lockwood's previous
    band, Pop Threat, were a more aggressive beast, with song titles like
    ""Sugar Fuck"" and even distorted vocals. Here, the Manhattan Love
    Suicides telegraph their decidedly unmacho heritage with an upbeat but
    unnecessary cover of Beat Happening's droning classic ""Indian
    Summer""-- the album's only misstep. Acoustic ballad ""Thinking Is Killing
    Me"" adds cello and finds McChrystal's voice sounding like the Softies'
    Rose Melberg as she complains, ""You said you'd write me a letter/ But you
    just sent a postcard/ And that's really not the same."" In today's
    downtown, that's how you make the kids squirm.

    New wave is hardly a genre asking for today's increasingly chic
    drum+instrument treatment, but Brooklyn duo Matt and Kim get the greenlight all
    the same. Unlike, say, the White Stripes, whose minimalist approach strips
    classic rock back down to its grass roots, Matt and Kim hardly constitute a
    paradigm shift in jerky, synth-laden pop. In fact, one cursory listen and you
    probably wouldn't even notice only two people are performing.</p><p>
    With eleven songs in under half an hour, <em>Matt and Kim</em> meets textbook
    pop standards. Matt's right hand and voice provide interlocking lead melodies; his left hand and Kim's peppy percussion bubble underneath. So yes, it's
    formulaic in both the best and worst sense of the word. Nearly every track
    kicks off with a stomping beat from Kim while Matt slowly pours on first a
    buzzing bassline, and then the song's signature synth riff. Also, pretty much
    every track follows the A-B-A-B songwriting formula, only very rarely venturing
    off into hushed breakdowns or, even rarer, bridges.</p><p>
    Still, as their video for ""5k""
    suggests, Matt and Kim are the quintessential ""party"" band, each song
    winding up and exploding on cue before reloading for the next number. This
    quality probably best distinguishes them from the similarly constructed duo
    Mates of State, whose nuanced nooks and crannies would be drowned out in Matt
    and Kim's anthemic, make-every-chorus count universe. 
    </p>
<p>
    Two-minute powderkegs ""It's a Fact"" and ""5k"" set the
    standard for explosive party numbers here, both skittering over anxious verses
    in gleeful anticipation of a sing-along refrain. Even when scanting the tempo,
    the band can't stop exuding energy-- they can only hope to contain it.
    ""Dash After Dash"" and ""No More Long Years"" soar on
    strangely melancholic synth lines, though Matt's snotty vocals combined with
    Kim's scattershot drumming dissipate any lingering emo residue. 
    </p>
<p>
    The
    ""e"" word looms over most of the debut, particularly during moments
    when the instruments are hushed and Matt's disarming squawks take center stage.
    Much like the last We Are Scientists record, <em>Matt and Kim</em> presents
    left-of-center, almost post-punk concepts alongside surprisingly simple
    melodies and song structures. While not exactly up to the task of stitching
    together such disparate influences as Wire, the Fall, Weezer, and Hot Hot Heat,
    Matt and Kim's debut sports enough interesting hooks and bacchanalian 'tude to
    mask the artistic clumsiness.

    Julie Doiron on her new album.  And I'll be damned if you don't just want to
    hold her, and maybe spend the whole day curled up under a blanket with her,
    staring out the window at the grey Canadian winter.  A solid dose of comforting,
    resolute melancholy can be good for the soul sometimes, and despite being the
    most upbeat album of Doiron's musical oeuvre (thanks in part to having a real
    backing band this time out), <i>Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars</i> still
    delivers the 100% RDA.</p><p>
    
    Like Bettie Serveert's Carol van Dijk without the sunny smiles, Beth Orton
    without the reverb chamber and the Chemical Brothers connection, or Jenny
    Toomey on Xanax, Doiron has a natural ache in her voice that manages to
    sidestep both wistful whimsy and wretched despair. Her previous solo work
    seemed to be a bit too stark and four-tracky to distinguish itself from the
    rest of the already-saturated mope-rock market; here, she teams up with
    fellow Canadians the Wooden Stars to create a much warmer, more fully
    developed sound which supports her vocal timbre a bit better. There are
    still plenty of beautiful downbeat moments, like ""The Longest Winter""
    (""Not even the prank calls/ Are helping pass the time anymore"") or ""Seven.""
    But it's also surprisingly pleasant to hear Doiron fit herself into slightly
    different clothes, such as on the perky, almost Cardigans-like ""Dance Music""
    and the stiff, insistent bounce of ""The Best Thing for Me.""</p><p>
    
    Although eleven songs and 42 minutes long, <i>Julie Doiron and the Wooden
    Stars</i> still seems a bit slight. Maybe it's because it's a rather easy,
    effortless listen, albeit something you'd only put in your stereo once in a
    while. But like hot chocolate on a cold night, it has its proper time and
    place.</p></div>"|2408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2408-julie-doiron-and-the-wooden-stars/|6.8|Nick Mirov

    When the Beatles kicked open the door to the U.S. market for British
    musicians in 1963, it didn't take long for a flood of others to stream in behind them.
    One of the first to capitalize was Dusty Springfield, whose 1963 smash ""I
    Only Want to Be with You"" introduced Americans to her uncommonly soulful
    voice in the guise of string-soaked girl-group pop with a major bounce in its
    step. You can still hear it pretty regularly on oldies radio. If she'd done
    nothing else, she'd be pleasantly remembered as a highlight of the UK beat girl
    phenomenon, but she was only warming up: In the decade that followed she
    established herself as one of Britain's best female singers, and possibly its
    best soul singer.</p><p>
    Her instrument was truly a gift. She was an alto with a powerful, dexterous
    voice that sounded equally at home breezing through an upbeat pop hit or
    wrapping itself around a sultry slice of Memphis soul. Eclipse, a new label run
    by Saint Etienne's Bob Stanley, has done a great job of pulling together all of
    the A and B sides from the most fertile period of her career (excepting a Christmas
    single and a B-side sung by her brother Tom), and creatively sequencing them
    with the push sides arranged chronologically on disc one and their flips on
    disc two.</p><p>
    You might think that'd make for a much weaker disc two, but that's not the
    case. These are her British singles, for one thing, and several of her U.S.
    A-sides-- ""The Look of Love"", for instance-- were sent to side two.
    For another, she was a perfectionist who never slacked in her delivery, and she
    could do wonderful things with almost any material, so the B-sides are
    uniformly as sharp as their counterparts. The UK singles tracklist might
    leave a few American listeners scratching their heads, as two of her biggest
    U.S. hits, ""Wishing and Hoping"" and ""All Cried Out"", weren't
    singles in the UK. But they're not really missed when confronted with the
    strength of everything included here. 
    </p>
<p>
    When Dusty cut ""I Only Want to Be with You"" she was fresh off
    leaving her family folk group the Springfields, inspired by the American girl
    groups she heard while touring the States. She cultivated an image with an eye
    toward those same American women, applying copious dark eye shadow and creating
    a series of striking blonde sculptures atop her head. In early 1960s Britain,
    this was the height of glamour and a u-turn away from the staid ladies who had
    served in the pop vanguard to that point. Johnny Franz, who also worked with
    the Walker Brothers at their orchestral peak, dreamed up a world of sumptuous
    orchestration to complement her powerful voice. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Give Me Time"" answers her pleas in the chorus with sweeping
    strings and horns, with a full choir hanging in the wings, and the drums sound
    like they were recorded in a canyon. The massive hit ""You Don't Have to
    Say You Love Me"" has a sound as big as its chart success, but she holds
    back the crashing cymbals and lumbering orchestra with her voice-- she's
    absolutely soaring on that chorus, and yet sounds relaxed, as though she might
    actually be holding back a bit. Dusty perfected performing on this huge
    canvass, but by the late 60s, the commercial returns were diminishing in spite
    of the fact that she was recording some of her best material in widescreen
    ballads like 1968's ""I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten"", a song whose
    bombast leads to dark corners dripping with Rhodes piano. 
    </p>
<p>
    To jumpstart her career, she came back to the home of her original beat girl
    spark, the U.S., recording the epochal album <em>Dusty in Memphis</em> with Stax
    session players. The album didn't sell in huge numbers, but it did spawn
    ""Son of a Preacher Man"", one of the decade's best soul singles and
    one of Dusty's most enduring recordings. Her next stop was Philadelphia for
    sessions with Gamble &amp; Huff. <em>A Brand New Me</em> was nearly as good as
    its predecessor, and the title track is one of the strongest A-sides here. Her
    sway over the charts was seriously fading by the time the final single on this
    set, a cover of the Young Rascals' ""How Can I Be Sure?"", hit the
    racks; but that doesn't stop it from being a brilliantly melodramatic waltz,
    its swaying chord progression outlined by a rich accordion part and a huge bass
    line. 
    </p>
<p>
    Its B-side, her take on Classics IV's ""Spooky"",
    has such an effortless cool that got it placed on the soundtrack to Guy Ritchie's <em>Lock,
    Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels</em> soundtrack just a few years ago. It's just
    one of the A-side-worthy treats on disc two. ""Summer Is Over"" is
    another waltz, arranged by Ivor Raymonde to slowly surround Springfield's vocal
    with ever-heavier orchestration as her voice moves from a breathy near-whisper
    to a gripping delivery from deep within her chest. If it had been an obscure
    American single rather than a Dusty B-side, the Goffin/King cover ""I'll
    Love You for a While"" could have been big on the Northern Soul scene. And
    then, of course, there's ""The Look of Love"", with Dusty at her
    sensual best. 
    </p>
<p>
    The track-by track could get out of control quickly if you hit all the
    highlights-- ""I'm Gonna Leave You"" is so good it's hard to believe
    it was stuffed on the flip of ""Goin' Back""-- but let's just say that
    this is essential listening for fans of all kinds of things, from sweet soul to
    UK beat to girl groups. Dusty would record on and off until her death from
    breast cancer in 1999, but she never again reached the heights she occupied in
    the 60s. It doesn't matter. The recordings she made then have the kind of
    quality that makes them timeless, and this compilation flawlessly captures her
    best days.

<em>Adventura Anatomica</em> documents a live performance by Norwegian singer,
    composer, and sound artist Maja Ratkje. On a minimally appointed stage with
    dancers and hanging, two-dimensional birdlike constructions, Ratkje used a
    homemade sampling tool called ImproSculpt, harmonica, flute, some metal
    objects, and a vast array of vocal and bodily noises to craft this abstruse yet
    engrossing sound collage.</p><p>
    I'm rushing through these preliminary details because they have little to do
    with the actual experience of listening to this record. By the fourth track, <em>Adventura
    Anatomica</em> seals you in so completely that it nearly blots out everything but the music itself, including the details of its creation.
    This isn't to say that what Ratkje does here lacks exterior points of
    reference. The Italian futurist Marinetti laid the groundwork for this type of
    sound art with his seminal ""sound poem"" <em>Zang Tumb Tumb</em>. Rich with
    inventive typography and onomatopoeias, it inspired Luigi Russolo to start
    building his noise machines. Kurt Schwitters' recorded sound poem, <em>Ursonate</em>, which
    <em>Adventura Anatomica</em> resembles, is another clear precursor to Ratkje's
    preference for deranged vocal sound effects to more traditional intonations.</p><p>
    We tend to expect experimental musicians to break the mold with every effort
    while allowing rockers and rappers to rehearse the same idiom over and over.
    The vitality of Ratkje's album reveals the flaw in this thinking. Far from
    sounding like a derivation of the fine company it keeps, <em>Adventura Anatomica</em>
    is a singular experience. It's possible to map the terrain: the first two
    tracks are comprised of little more than sucking, clicking, and dragging noises
    scattered judiciously across a vast field of silence. As the album eventually shapes up into something like a postmodern play about fairy tales,
    these
    opening tracks are the sound of the forest set being wheeled onto the stage.
    </p>
<p>
    On ""The Red Hooded Lady of the Woods"", the rising action begins in
    earnest: With the words ""Once upon a time,"" an increasing chorus of
    Ratkjes gradually weaves an overlapping litany into a nest of shadowy
    whispers. ""Too Many Trees"" is as claustrophobic as its title suggests, an intensifying nightmare amalgamation of hoarse murmurs, snorts, cackles, and chirps, as saturated as the early tracks are
    desiccated. ""Once Upon a Time"" grants us a respite with its eerie yet
    serene drones, while ""Floating, Hiding, Posing"" blends an angelic
    warble into a noise explosion where Ratkje beatboxes strident, concussive vocal
    tones that flutter and careen like bats. On ""The Wolf"", she somehow
    makes herself sound like a vacuum cleaner battling a squeaky rubber balloon.
    </p>
    So,
    as I said, it is possible to map <em>Adventura Anatomica</em>. More difficult is
    figuring out what it's a cartography <em>of</em>, once all the constituent parts
    are assembled. Certainly, this record is about fairy tales. The imagery of
    trees, woods, and red hoods are a dead giveaway and the album's sense of
    perpetual wonder at the mundane is commensurate with
    fairy tales' unique logic. But it's also about the body. Listening to the
    record, you become aware of the body as a phenomenal sound source, suddenly
    noticing the musical potential of your gurgling stomach, the blood squeaking in
    your ears, your knuckles popping. But <em>Adventura Anatomica</em> transcends <em>about</em>;
    it constructs a conceptual space you enter into, and the question remains:
    Where are we, when we're in here? The album cover contains a clue: It's a
    close-up of Ratjke's face, pale amid dark hair, eyes shining like portals into
    an utterly interior space.</div>"|9730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9730-adventura-anatomica/|7.8|Brian Howe

    Ángel Sánchez, the man behind Seekers Who Are Lovers, has previously
    released music under the name Antiguo Autómata Mexicano. What I've heard from
    this project falls in the glitch/dub/minimal techno vein, with carefully
    constructed rips and blips stretched across a wide, white sonic canvas. Owing
    something, perhaps, to the relative success of the Nortec Collective generally
    and Fernando Corona's Murcof in particular, Mexican producers from Tijuana and Mexicali as well as Sánchez's hometown of Monterrey have produced a lot of minimal
    electronic music.</p><p>
    Seekers Who Are Lovers is a vastly different project for Sánchez, in that it
    focuses on songs and his voice. Lots of electronic producers decide at some
    point to work vocals into their music, and many take to the mic themselves;
    none I've heard possesses the vocal talent of Sánchez. His androgynous croon,
    which oscillates between masculine and feminine in the manner of artists like
    Nina Simone and Bryan Ferry, is rich, ethereal and supple. That the name of
    this project is drawn from a Cocteau Twins track is a further clue to the sonic
    world Sánchez is after.</p><p>
    The opening cover of Will Oldham's ""It's a Hard Life"" lays out
    nicely the boundaries of the project. The simple country shuffle of the
    original is cast aside in favor of a skipping record and a piercing
    organ, placing the lament in, say, the center a one-room wooden church being
    consumed by slow-motion flames. And in the middle of it all stands Sánchez,
    voicing the lyrics with a pinch of an accent giving the words an extra shot of
    strangeness. It's a drone piece, with only two real changes of note: one comes
    when Sánchez elevates ""with no wife"" by a third halfway through,
    going from merely dejected to desperately pleading; the other is the cloud of
    static that moves in like an airborne toxic event over the song's final third.
    Both are devastating in their simplicity. 
    </p>
<p>
    The positively radiant ""It's a Hard Life"" is the EP's easy highlight
    and the most pop moment on the record; other tracks are almost as good but
    better listened to with an ear for mood and texture. Where Fernando Corona
    mixes ""It's a Hard Life"", Rubén Tamayo of Fax-- Corona's partner in
    the Static Disco label-- produces and arranges the rest of the EP, pushing the
    music toward the kind of sensual bleakness that turns David Lynch on. Pedal
    steel guitars creep in, wisps of synth curl in the air like smoke, the gears of
    stuttering computers catch to remind us of this world's fundamental
    uncertainty. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Modern Heirs"" is referentially soulful in a way that reminds me
    of Brightblack Morning Light, but the lyrics are weird and disorienting. The
    skipping guitars are reminiscent of <em>Pop Ambient </em>linchpin Klimek, while
    the track's heartbeat bass pulse is just a remix tweak away from wobbling into
    a frighteningly stoned downtempo mix. ""Cereza"", with its nylon
    acoustic plucks and moonlight-kissed drone, is the record at its most gaseous,
    the kind of track you might need a secret affinity for Enya to appreciate
    fully. 
    </p>
    But
    I don't want to sell <em>You Are the Pride of Your Street</em> short; it's moody
    noir in the extreme, but it never coasts on style alone. There's a lot more
    going on here than a good record collection, and this EP is one of the most
    compelling from-nowhere surprises I've heard in a long time. We'll be hearing a
    lot more from Ángel Sánchez.</div>"|9733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9733-you-are-the-pride-of-your-street-ep/|8.2|Mark Richardson

Typically enough, however, this recognition has come at a time when the wayfaring duo have already begun moving their sound out onto virgin pastures. Together with their current group the Bummer Road, in their latest work the two have largely abandoned overt folk gestures in favor of heavier, more electric space-blues. This subtle directional shift was much in evidence on the group's massive 2006 double album <em>Mother of Thousands</em>, and is even more pronounced on their Ecstatic Peace debut <em>Green Blues</em>. Here, for the first time, MV and EE make music that might almost be briefly confused with conventional rock, before it eventually mutates and spirals away as ever into the duo's own uniquely stylized private solar system.</p><p>
    By all appearances, <em>Green Blues</em> was produced in the same homespun manner-- which Valentine has cheekily dubbed ""MV Spectravision""-- as the duo's umpteen previous albums, many of them self-released on their Child of Microtones imprint. Yet there is no question that this <em>sounds</em> like the Bummer Road's biggest budget recording to date. MV and EE's shared vocals are given an increased authority in the mix, while the rest of the group's heavily FX-treated instruments are carefully balanced with a newfound clarity. The group sound here is rounded out by such Bummer Road mainstays as Mo' Jiggs on harmonica, Tim Barnes on drums, Samara Lubelski on bass and violin, and a pair of these outspread tracks even feature the contributions of J. Mascis on mellotron.</p><p>
    In his earlier work with Tower Recordings and in previous incarnations of MV and EE's ongoing project The Medicine Show, Valentine was among the first guitarists of his generation to widely incorporate elements from the then out-of-print Takoma and ESP back catalogs, along with other esoteric loner-folk details from his record collection. These finger-picked, backwoods acoustic ragas are but a hazy memory on <em>Green Blues'</em> opening ""East Mountain Joint"", a shambling rock ode written in praise of high country living. ""I spark one off...the sound is cranked, Pretty Things on the radio/ And I'm free, F-R-double-E,"" the duo sing in unison, effortlessly recalling the glazed roots dislocation of early Royal Trux. Aided in part by the primitive guitar of Willie ""Gutbucket"" Lane, the hard-stomping ""Canned Happiness"" digs even deeper, migrating its John Lee Hooker rhythms into a vortex of time-shifting delay and communal New England mysticism.
    </p><p>
    As with the recent work of such contemporaries as Califone or Jackie-O Motherfucker, MV and EE have proven able to effectively subvert the shopworn conventions of roots-based music, primarily due to the way they've been able to wholly internalize and intuitively reconfigure their source material. On ""Mine All Troubled Blues"" Elder sings a lyric that might have appeared on a Bessie Smith side nearly a century ago (""My man treats me so mean/ I don't know right from wrong"") but wisely avoids attempting a standard over-emotive vocal treatment. Instead, she delivers the song with an unsettling, glassy-eyed detachment, sounding as though she's quietly on the verge of burning the place to the ground with everybody inside. 
    </p>
<p>
    On this track, as on the epic jams ""Grassthighs"" and the 18-minute closer ""Solar Hill"", MV and EE are aided tremendously by the unorthodox playing of their supporting cast, particularly Mo' Jiggs. In constant dialogue with Valentine's acid guitar leads, Jiggs' alien harmonica figures hover in suspension like giant sea turtles placidly moving through sunlit waters. Meanwhile, characters with stage names like Sparrow Wildchild and Nemo Bidstrup contribute an assortment of flutes, tambura, and ukelin to the music's gauzy structure. As it slowly grows to full flutter, ""Solar Hill"" draws upon the radiant echoes of some of the Grateful Dead's extended pastoral voyages. And though it offers reminders of MV and EE's still potent free-folk imagination, it also leaves one with the impression that their pioneering trail is still likely too personalized, twined and twisted to lure many future settlers.

    The artwork for the first Silent Years album features a
    menagerie of small plastic animals cavorting in dioramas, predators and prey
    mingling under unspoken truce. It's so cute I was half expecting some kind of
    twee onslaught when I put the disc in the player, but instead I got something a
    world apart from its packaging. This Detroit
    band offers a highly melodic brand of pretty straightforward indie rock,
    tinged with just a bit of unusual instrumentation and a lot of analog keyboards
    in the mix to nudge things slightly left of center.</p><p>
    Lead vocalist Josh Epstein is a strong singer whose voice
    reminds me of so many other things it doesn't wind up reminding me of anything
    at all in the end. He's the principle writer, too, and he uses that versatile
    voice to its fullest extent, penning a series of fine hooks that the band
    arranges with a collective ear toward nuance and breathing space. Most of these
    songs feature moments where the band stops to collect itself amidst a hail of
    effects or omnichord. ""Take the Money Out"" is a good example, with its big,
    pounding chorus offset by welcome moments of reflection where the beat
    drops away and the instruments gather for the next assault on the hook.</p><p>
    The album begins strongly and ends even more strongly,
    with four of the best songs slotted consecutively at its close. ""Take the Money Out"" begins this run, and ""Sharks"" and ""The Devil Wears
    Sunshine"" feed off of its momentum-- the former especially sets up a nice tension
    between the band's purest power pop tendencies and their desire to tweak the
    edges and catch the listener off guard with unexpected pauses. Closer ""Lost at
    Sea"" is a simple acoustic ballad backed with mallet percussion that gives
    Epstein one of his best vocal showcases. It's a fairly standard ""we've both
    changed"" song lyrically, but he gets maximum emotion from it with his falsetto.
    </p>
<p>
    Back at the front of the album, ""No Secrets"" gives him
    another immediately gripping melody to work with, and the band waxes new wave
    with the catchy keyboard motifs that answer the vocals. There are only a few
    flaws: the mix is a little off on ""This Town"", where Epstein and his clever lyric get lost
    behind the mildly distorted guitar, and bedroom
    recording ""Devil Got My Woman"" nods to early blues in its refrain, but is ultimately
    a throwaway comma before the heavyweight back third of the album kicks in.
    </p>
<p>
    Even the weaker songs have some excellent moments, such as
    the vocal harmony and mbira interlude in ""Aisleways"", which won me over more
    quickly than the chorus. <em>The Silent Years</em>
    is a good debut album from astute pop craftsmen who should have
    enough tricks up their sleeves to last beyond a group's initial burst of creativity.

    There's more than a little griping in hip-hop circles these
    days, and not just from disgruntled older listeners, hungry for something ""fun"" that
    resembles the refracted memories of their youth. Fans are hungry for an MC they can genuinely admire-- one who doesn't resort to moral backpedaling,
    misogyny, foolishness, or even guile. An honest guy, but not just an
    everyman. A super-everyman. In many ways, Brooklyn's Mos
    Def (née Dante Smith), should have been that guy. With his third solo album, <em>True Magic</em>, that dream is all
    but over.</p><p>
    It's been rumored that this is a deal-closer, the last album
    Mos owes Geffen Records, the label that inherited him when Rawkus Records
    folded in 2002 and was rolled into Interscope Records' vast empire. Mos, who's
    best known now as an Emmy-nominated actor, or concurrently ""that guy from the
    Denali commercial,"" seems to have lost any interest in a music career, at least
    one under Geffen's umbrella. Everything about this album is half-assed: From
    the bafflingly bare packaging to the at-times miserable mix, <em>True Magic</em> is a mess. Experimentation
    has been an organizing principle for Mos for some time, from the jagged riffs
    and polemics of ""Rock N Roll"" from his debut <em>Black on Both Sides</em> to the psych noodlings and bluesy
    crooning on his last album, the uneven and only slightly less calamitous <em>The New Danger</em>. Here, experimentation
    isn't even on the radar.</p><p>
    These songs feel blah-ed out, packed with idle rhymes that
    sound as if they've been sitting in a notebook that never should have been
    opened. Take this nugget from ""Undeniable"", a song nominated for a Grammy this
    year, one presumes because Mos carries some sort of artistic clout: ""These
    jokers don't want none/ And all the pretty mamis want some/ Tell 'em come.""
    Thrilling.
    </p>
<p>
    The production doesn't help often, either. ""Murder of a Teenage Life""
    is turgid and off-key-- death knells for a rhymer-- while ""Fake Bonanza"" is the
    sort of aimless, generic production that gives boho rappers a bad name. Some tracks here would be decent fodder for a C-level
    mixtape, like ""Crime &amp; Medicine"", a note-for-note remake of GZA's ""Liquid
    Swords"", minus the Genius' lyrical bite and intensity. Also included is the
    much-maligned ""Dollar Day (Surprise, Surprise)"", his Hurricane Katrina missive
    released last year. Messily rhyming in an odd twang over Juvenile side project
    UTP's ""Nolia Clap"", Mos received a pass for the song, as his heart is clearly
    in the right place (at least he dissed Bono), even if his ear seemed
    waterlogged. But to include it on a proper album is a poor move. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, Mos Def is an engaging figure that has long radiated the
    charisma, if not the work ethic, to grab the mantle hanging above his head. ""U
    R the One"" is a lovelorn, confused wail-- the grown continuation of his own
    ""Ms. Fat Booty"". He raps: ""When we met your face was so brown, your ass was so
    round, of course I'm so down/ Wish I knew then what the fuck I know
    now/ Couldn't read the signs of the road: SLOW DOWN."" It's one of the few
    symbols of growth here. Even the simplistic and poorly recorded ""There Is a
    Way"", a song with just two lines, has verve-- even some uplift-- in its
    rally-cry sloganeering.
    </p>
<p>
    For years, it seemed as if Mos' songs had ideas and that those ideas had vision (assuming we can all ignore ""New World Water""), woven smartly
    with a bookish, booming flow. And suddenly, as his acting profile grew, his
    musical output faltered. Many of the songs that leaked prior to <em>True Magic</em>'s release aren't included
    here, offering some a glimmer of hope that Mos is holding that stuff close to the vest for
    his first post-Geffen project. Still, the apathy here signals some
    sort of finality. Whether it's the end of a chapter or a book is unclear.

Instead,
    they display their city's love of another sound: rough-edged,
    unpolished indie rock. On their charismatic debut <em>Sing the Greys</em>,
    Frightened Rabbit keep the instrumentation simple-- drums, bass,
    guitar, and straightforward washes of keyboard and accordion. The
    arrangements, too, are linear and humble, often blending shaggy
    elements with rigid ones to create a sense of purposeful drift. Setting
    loose guitar jangle against a tight bass pulse, the excellent ""Yawns""
    finds singer Scott (just Scott) wrapping his coarse moan around some
    stirring moments of relationship inertia (""She yawns because she's
    bored/ He yawns because he can't sleep any more""). ""Go-Go Girls"" starts
    off tightly coiled, with a hellacious circular bassline zipping through
    volleys of percussion, before cascading into a triumphant garage-pop
    shuffle.</p><p>
    Camera Obscura are from Glasgow, too, but Frightened Rabbit's not like
    them, either. Where Camera Obscura's roots plunge into the annals of
    music history from Lee Hazelwood to Dory Previn, Frightened Rabbit's
    rambunctious bursts of enthusiasm seem to refer to little beyond indie
    rock's ahistorical everymen-- dudes having a good time with music in
    whichever way they please. Indie rock loves apathy, and Frightened Rabbit pay lip service to that tradition on ""The Greys"". It's a catchy,
    ragged ode to numbness (""What's the blues when you've got the greys?"")
    that's belied by its impassioned delivery: Frightened Rabbit don't go
    to great lengths to sell disaffection; this is fun, unpretentious
    music. Two of the members are brothers who pose for their press photos
    in Lucha Libre masks and only go by their first names, if that gives
    you some idea.</p><p>
    Mogwai are from Glasgow, too, but Frightened Rabbit's <em>definitely</em>
    not like Mogwai. Where Mogwai's music is all about creating a grand
    atmosphere that dwarfs the listener, with little emphasis on the band
    members' personalities, Frightened Rabbit's is all about homely charm.
    They take a stab at ambiance on three brief, pleasant interludes-- the
    fuzz wash and martial clatter of ""The First Incident"", the baggy
    harmonies of ""The Second Incident"", and the choppy keys of ""The Final
    Incident""-- and at the epic, with the seven-minute-plus ""Square 9"". But
    for the most part, grandeur is not their thing-- the thumping drums,
    silvery guitars, and blurring vocals of ""Music Now"" all unfold in
    modest human scale. Naysayers will find an easy jibe in the lyric ""Make
    your music/ Make it so loud and so trite,"" but for Frightened Rabbit,
    this is a rallying cry, a rejection of the stylish and self-serious,
    and a redemption of the trite through the embrace of its universality.</p></div>"|9715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9715-sing-the-greys/|7.5|Brian Howe

    interpretation. Thus lead is the parody of gold. Air is the parody of water.
    The brain is the parody of the equator. Coitus is the parody of crime. Gold,
    water, the equator, or crime can each be put forward as the principle of
    things... The sea continuously jerks off.</em><br/>
    --Georges Bataille</p><p>
    So goes, in part, the text of Bataille's 1927 essay ""The Solar Anus"". And
    it's hard to resist, right? <em>Everyone is aware that Solar Anus, the band, are
    parodic and that they lack an interpretation. Thus their band name is a parody
    of a band name. Their grunting sludge is the parody of real music. Their
    color-saturated semi-pornography is the parody of cover art. Listening to Solar
    Anus is the parody of relaxation and enjoyment...Solar Anus continuously jerk
    off.</em> And so on.</p><p>
    Japan's Solar Anus share Bataille's pedigree as an obscurity, as
    surrealists, and-- now that they've broken up and been memorialized-- as an
    artifact, too. Voluntarily consigned to the secret history, Solar Anus join an
    infinite parade of bands such as Sloth, Cathedral, the Electric Prunes, and Exit
    13, many of whom they thank in their liner notes. Because they only
    began recording in 1997, you couldn't quite call them legendary, but there are worse secrets to
    be let in on.
    </p><p>
<em>Skull Alcoholic: The Complete Solar Anus</em> is stunning as an object,
    sporting a die-cut sun in both front and back, and full-color,
    florescent-headache illustrations throughout. Over two discs it contains the
    sum total of the act's output: 1997's <em>On</em>, 1999's <em>Trance!!</em>, and
    their final document, 2000's <em>Next World News</em>. Proving the intentionality
    behind their madness, the records get better with each passing year, conclusively moving
    them beyond weirdness for weirdness' sake, although that was often their
    method. The constants were airy Acid Mothers solos and an endlessly muddy
    undercurrent; but by the end they'd excelled beyond Motörhead riffs and reached a paradisical middle ground between Can and early Metallica. Their songs were also incredibly long. 
    </p>
<p>
    A fusillade of rotting fruit thrown nowhere in particular. Necrophilia.
    One-mile-per-hour lava flow. Like Bataille's work, Solar Anus lend themselves
    not to narrative but lurid imagery. There is the prehistoric drumming. There
    are the ambiguous, half torture/half ecstasy screaming and choking sounds.
    There are the long boogieing passages that go on for 10 minutes at a time.
    There are no songs: only an ever doomier and more esoteric movement sideways. 
    </p>
<p>
    Early material such as ""Blue Hood"" has stomp and focus but
    flickering inspiration. Later update ""Enemy Disappear"" fuses the
    act's early crunch with a sense of purpose and patience to inflict maximum damage on a listener's mind. They pause; they breathe at you; they stutter
    at you; they spit in your face and drool on your shoulder. ""Die in the
    Space"" is like an overstuffed Japanese experimental history lesson:
    minimalist Keiji Haino meditation becomes Tetuzi Akiyama riffery becomes Kawabata abstraction becomes Boredoms toms-n-chants, an endless litany vomited out
    for what feels like forever. It's not for the faint of Japanese improv
    heart. 
    </p>
<p>
    Most seem to agree that the second disc makes the first one disposable: All
    the best songs, from the Cadillac riffing on ""The Extreme North"" and
    ""Bone Flesh"" to the off-speed Kraut-thump of ""Meat
    Pressure"", are there. But Solar Anus are a fundamentally immersive
    experience, and they need all their water to drown you properly. Finally, it's

    Ever since she began putting her name on the front of
    her albums, Tara Jane O'Neil has perfected the art of writing songs that
    perfectly encapsulate both the comfort of misery and the misery of comfort. On <em>In
    Circles</em>, her sixth full-length, O'Neil once again couches these themes in
    the folk music/tape loop aesthetic she's consistently revisited throughout her
    solo work. While that may make the album sound like a rote sigh-by-numbers
    exercise, <em>In Circles</em> might be the best non-Rodan release O'Neil has been
    associated with.</p><p>
    What makes this album stand out is O'Neil's ability to
    seamlessly mix electronics (such as the aforementioned tape loops, as well as
    some judiciously used feedback and guitar effects) into songs that, left alone,
    could very well have come from the dilapidated porch of a forlorn Kentucky shack.
    Indeed, one of the album's more straightforward tracks, ""Blue Light
    Room"", plays as straight country-and-western. O'Neil's plaintive voice
    is abetted solely by guitar, drums and pedal steel, the perfect backdrop for
    lyrical sentiments such as, ""I found languor and love in a bottle.""</p><p>
    The more adorned tracks on <em>In Circles</em>, however,
    don't lack the homemade charm of their less encumbered brethren. The album's
    opener, ""Primer"", begins with what sounds like wind chimes naturally
    colliding. Over the course of the track, that sound is transformed into a
    glistening, shimmering curtain of sound-- it's an obvious manipulation, but sounds as natural as its originating source. O'Neil blends sounds in a swirling
    manner that's not dissimilar to the way she paints her record covers. The
    delicate distortion and feedback that introduces ""A Room for These""
    ebbs and flows by itself, then gently gives way to the song's soothing waltz. 
    </p>
<p>
    Her instrumentation choices blend into the tracks in a
    similar fashion. Soft, melancholy melodica chords sound off like timid foghorns
    in the background of ""A Partridge Song"". Instead of clashing with the
    gentleness of the song, their comforting dissonance finds a fitting home within
    O'Neil's measured acoustic plucking and her fragile voice. She might bury her
    vocals demurely on most of these tracks, but don't let that fool you: Tara Jane
    O'Neil is at the height of her creative powers, and <em>In Circles</em> is a
    confident document of her strengths.

    Jackie Mittoo was one of the great names in Jamaican music,
    manning the keyboards for the Skatalites, the Soul Vendors, and Sound
    Dimension-- three of the greatest house bands of the 60s (and I mean <em>anywhere</em>,
    not just in Jamaica).
    He was just a teenager when Studio One boss and producer Coxsone Dodd gave him his break, and by 1968, he was
    Kingston music royalty, enthroned at the organ and so well-regarded he probably
    could have had all the work he wanted for as long as he wanted it.</p><p>
    But Mittoo felt the need for a new beginning, and like many
    Jamaicans, looked northward for it, ultimately settling in Toronto's large West Indian community. It was
    a fresh start, but with fresh starts come hard work, and Mittoo found himself
    paying his dues playing anywhere that would have him. When you have the talent
    he had, getting noticed doesn't take long, and if Mittoo found Toronto unfamiliar and sometimes confusing,
    he was quickly accepted by lots of people who were going through the same
    thing or already had.</p><p>
    Summus Records was a small division of a prominent Canadian
    advertising and marketing firm, run by Jamaican accountant Carl DeHaney-- you can
    imagine DeHaney's excitement at the prospect of working with one of his
    homeland's all-time greats. The album DeHaney produced for Mittoo, <em>Wishbone</em>, was an eclectic and above all
    joyful record that really only failed commercially on account of awful
    distribution. Light in the Attic has made this lost little gem the latest entry
    in its excellent Jamaica to Toronto series (look for
    the clever green, yellow and black maple leaf), and the sound is spectacular. 
    </p>
<p>
    Far from the stripped combo work Mittoo had done in Jamaica, this
    album is loaded to the gills with lush orchestration, with Mittoo leading
    the way on organ and overdubbed piano. The reggae beat lies at the core of the
    sound, but there's a heavy dose of soul and funk in this music, as well as
    gospel and easy listening. Pitting members of the Toronto Symphony against Joe
    Isaacs' snapping drums and Mittoo's roaring organ makes for an entertaining
    listen, and these mostly instrumental songs are just so damn happy you'd have
    to be a class-A grump not to smile just a little. 
    </p>
<p>
    Jamaican music has long nicked little snippets of popular
    songs from around the world, and Mittoo does plenty of that in his solos here,
    flirting with everything from ""Spooky"" and ""Spinning Wheel"" to Christmas carols and ""Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da"", which of course was Paul McCartney's tribute to
    ska in the first place. The Beatles riffs come on the bouncing title single,
    which is so infectious it's easy to see how it become a major Canadian radio
    hit. The big, schmaltzy orchestration one might expect to clash with the
    groove-driven ka-chink of reggae actually feels right, and Mittoo doesn't seem
    at all fazed or overwhelmed working through it.
    </p>
<p>
    As great as the instrumentals are, the show is really stolen
    by four vocal numbers, one sung by Mittoo, the others by an unnamed singer.
    ""Love Life"" and ""Love of Life"" are related in more than title-- they're two parts
    of the same song, essentially, the former encouraging brotherhood, the latter
    encouraging you to ""try a little happiness"" with its gospel-inflected chorus.
    Mittoo's lyrical approach was all about the affirmative: ""There may be days in
    your life when nothing seems right/ But nothing can change the times when
    you're feeling bright."" Closer ""Right Track"" is a burbling reggae-soul number
    with chorus that's catchy as all get-out and a huge orchestral arrangement
    spiked with funky horns. ""Soul Bird"", Mittoo's lead vocal turn, reveals him as
    a pretty decent singer, but it doesn't take Sam Cooke to make this thing
    memorable-- the opening ""got a message, little soul bird,"" backed up by female
    singers injecting encouragement, is a monster hook. 
    </p>
<p>
    Viewed in the shadow of his work in Kingston with Dodd, <em>Wishbone</em> obviously
    doesn't sound like Mittoo's most
    important/accomplished/influential/fill-in-the-blank music. But that's not the
    point. Listened to on its own merits, it's a record that's guaranteed to make
    you feel better-- ""a blast of sunshine from the islands"" as the man himself
    called it. There's confidence in this music, and effusive joy. We can always use
    a little of that.

    Every band plays music, but very few <em>play</em>, in the fun-having sense, as Super Furry Animals do. The infamous Glastonbury tank, electric space suits, and specially-commissioned films that have played roles in the Welsh group's live shows reflect the bizarre subject matter,  tarantula-legged genre-straddling, and multilingual puns of their totally bonkers recordings. The Furries actually play <em>so</em> much that they have fun and games left over for side projects: keyboardist Cian Ciárán's Acid Casuals, drummer Dafydd Ieuan's the Peth, and now a second solo album from SFA frontman Gruff Rhys.</p><p>
<em>Candylion</em> is 12 rounds of psychedelic Calvinball, new rules seemingly made up and abandoned as Rhys goes along chasing his eccentric muse. Where his solo debut, <em>Yr Atal Genhedlaeth</em>, was a relatively subdued, Welsh-only affair, its successor takes unseriousness as seriously as any official Furries effort, with string arrangements from High Llama Sean O'Hagan, mixing done in Rio de Janeiro with producer Mario Caldato Jr., and lilting guest vocals from Lisa Jen of Welsh folk group 9 Bach. (O'Hagan and Beastie Boys ace Caldato also lent their talents to 2005's SFA opus, <em>Love Kraft</em>.)</p><p>
    None of this hi-fi finery is enough to faze Rhys. Much like its predecessor, <em>Candylion</em> begins with a goofy joke: here, it comes with spoken-word synth opener ""This Is Just the Beginning"". The xylophone-tinged title track is an aggressively cute, Boy Least Likely To-like pop single with a simple acoustic guitar riff that runs close to Smokey Robinson's Motown classic ""Tracks of My Tears"", while ""Gyrru Gyrru Gyrru"", one of two Welsh-language songs, endlessly repeats the word for ""drive"" amid squelchy tropicália. (""It's a road song,"" Rhys has said.)
    </p>
<p>
    Rhys being Rhys, this eclectic collection doesn't shy away from more serious subjects, either. Lunar serenade ""Beacon in the Darkness"" picks up the Byrdsian pedal steel of 2003's <em>Phantom Power</em>; stately duet ""Con Carino"" waxes affectionate in broken Spanish; ""Painting People Blue"" goes Jackson Pollock with pastoral sorrow, over beeping bossa nova; and the percussion-pattering space-folk weeper ""Lonesome Words"" is to loneliness what ""Fire in My Heart"", from 1999 masterpiece <em>Guerrilla</em>, is to romantic ballads. 
    </p>
<p>
    The shaggy-haired singer goes so far as to make dichotomies a major recurring theme: ""Opposites push and pull to the fore,"" he sings on the title track. With double bass by Owen Evans, ""Now That the Feeling Has Gone"" shifts between molten sludge-rock and futuristic jazz-pop, as Rhys goes ""here"" and ""there"" with ""minimum care, maximum sound."" (Not that there's necessarily much difference between the two here.) And on sitar-droning ""Cycle of Violence"", through a cyclone of violins, Rhys suggests, ""Dirty bombs and clean ones look the same when you look closely.""
    </p>
<p>
    But Rhys reserves his biggest kicks for 13-minute finale ""Skylon!"", a narrative that juxtaposes an unlikely love affair with a violent airplane hijacking. ""Defined myself against everything you stand for,"" his narrator-- a professional bomb-disposal expert-- thinks bitterly toward the starlet who takes his window seat. A monotonous ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" rhythm section sets a high-flying mood. Spoiler alert: Rhys and the actress eventually sell photos of their lovechild for a reputed $1 million fee and ""live unhappily ever after.""

    There are some acts so thrillingly obscure and mysterious that to embrace them takes a certain leap of faith. In fact, the lack of a paper trail becomes part of the fun.</p><p>
    According to what little lore exists, Black Devil is the French duo Bernard Fevre and Jackie Giordano. Or maybe that's spelled Jacky Giordano, as he was credited on the group's 1978 EP, along with Joachim  Sherylee and Junior Claristidge, who may (or may not) be made-up, or possible pseudonyms of Fevre and Giordano. Until now, that EP was the only known document of the group's existance. Titled <em>Disco Club</em> (that is, assuming it wasn't a self-titled release by Black Devil Disco Club all along, to whom this disc is credited), it was initially released to little fanfare, but has steadily gained notoriety and recognition since its original issue. And rightly so: Its few spooky tracks of European electro-disco were brilliant enough to have supposedly influenced and inspired throngs of italo-disco and dance artists over the years.</p><p>
    Of course, the disc was a well-kept secret, until some deep cratedigging led the Chemical Brothers to sample a Black Devil track called ""Earthmessage"" on ""Got Glint?"" from their 1999 <em>Surrender</em> disc. And a few years later, in 2004, the first and only Black Devil <em>Disco Club</em> EP was parceled out via a series of 12""s by Rephlex, leading some to wonder whether the whole thing was just an elaborate ruse perpetrated by label co-founder Aphex Twin, who, as everybody knows, has nothing better to do than to prank his fans.</p><p>
    Fast forward two more years and a six-song disc has appeared credited to Black Devil Disco Club, titled <em>28 Later</em>. Is this the same Black Devil from 1978, twenty-eight years later? The copyright reads 2006, but the only credit on the jacket notes ""All Titles Written &amp; Produced by Bernard Fevre."" OK, but written and produced when? 1978? 1983? 2005? The eerily timeless disc could have been produced in any of those eras, as it propels itself along on a familiar and formula of analog synths, Giorgio Moroder-styled pulse/throb basslines, simple drum machine patterns, pitter-pattering faux bongo beats, and someone (Fevre?) singing heavily processed vocals and wordless gibberish.</p><p>
    And what of Giordano? Is he dead? Did he ever exist? Could he and Fevre be the same person? Mysterious French record dealer/producer/DJ Gwen Jamois gets a special shout out on the disc. What's his relationship? Did he dig this up? Did he <em>make</em> this up? And who's the dude with the Bruce Lee 'do pictured on the foldout sleeve? Better to just go with it, especially since there's so much giddy fun to be had here: <em>28 Later</em> is as proudly anachronistic as it may be ahead of its time-- full-on funky Euro-disco that doesn't skimp on the sleaze or, thankfully, the hooks.</p><p>
    ""The Devil in Us"" spends less than a minute on minimal synths and beats before a monster Moroder bassline sneaks in, and from then on, the only thing keeping the disc from total dancefloor dominance are the short gaps between tracks. The tempo kicks up a couple of cuts later with ""Coach Me"", and if the sound is largely the same, the smart arrangement squeezes maximum ideas into a minimal arrangement, all diva drama as drawn from the mind of a homespun bedroom genius.</p><p>
    On ""Part Two"" (the compact disc equivalent of side B), the irresistible synth-scatting of ""I Regret the Flower Power"" is as otherworldly as Jon Hassell's trademark trumpet, or the Knife's twisted vocals, while the deceptively spare condensed epic ""On Other Skin"" skirts clubland euphoria with its funky percussion stabs, canned handclaps, robo vocals and chilly keyboard flourishes. And then it all just ends, suddenly, like a strange fever dream that finally breaks-- until you hit play again to make sure what you thought you heard really happened. It did.

    The tape hiss that courses through nearly every song on Julie Sokolow's
    debut, <em>Something About Violins</em>, suggests what tape hiss usually
    suggests: a live-setting intimacy testifying to some sort of Luddite
    authenticity, whether in the recording (a basement four-track) or the instrumentation
    (a yard-sale turntable). Sokolow, a Pittsburgh native living in New York City,
    plays up this lo-fi sensibility, keeping instruments to a minimum (typically,
    just her voice and guitar) and basking in that airy hiss to create a sound
    that's not unlike early Cat Power or Julie Doiron.</p><p>
    But lo-fi as a movement, to which Sokolow alludes only tangentially, strikes
    me as an aesthetic of circumstance: Artists with limited access to technology,
    from Guided by Voices to the Grifters to Daniel Johnston, have turned that
    fuzzy sound into a viable genre. In this setting, Sokolow's guitar sounds
    textured, its high end tinnily bright and its low end reverberating roomily.
    Her voice sounds dreamily nuanced, personable yet mysterious as she
    contemplates unrequited love on ""Your Wrists"" and her
    fragile emotional state on ""Expanse's Net"".</p><p>
    But credit Sokolow with self-awareness: For her, lo-fi isn't a result of
    outsider circumstances, but an artistic choice. After all, she recorded these songs on her Mac G4's
    built-in mic. <em>Something About Violins</em> adroitly upends lo-fi's
    expectations of live performance, its songs full of artful touches and
    sophisticated layering of sounds. ""Alternations"" begins with a
    recital-quality piano; then she begins singing; then she begins layering
    multiple vocal tracks in an odd chorale. And then enters what sounds like a roomful
    of toy monkeys playing a roomful of miniature cymbals. Meanwhile, ""Solid"" is
    anything but. After a hushed verse, the song distorts in soft, quavering
    static, her words barely breaking the surface. ""End March"" incorporates
    a spoken-word verse that splinters into several voices, stitched together by a
    martial snare and delicate piano.
    </p>
<p>
    As confident as the album is, Sokolow realizes the potential ambiguity of
    sound and uses that to her advantage: ""I shook on the phone and it sounded
    like laughter,"" she sings matter-of-factly on ""Expanse's Net"".
    ""Broke plates in alarm and it sounded like clapping."" She's unafraid
    to portray herself in a less-than-flattering light, to candidly expose ""how
    ugly I can be"", as she states in ""Pictures"", without sounding
    self-absorbed or blandly confessional. Instead, she comes across as conflicted,
    her emotions as unresolved as her music, but her tough-minded, self-reflective
    lyrics give shape and solidity to these mercurial songs. That may be the most
    intriguing aspect of <em>Something About Violins</em>: her lyrics explain why her
    music sounds the way it does.

    ""The only thing worse than blacking out is waking
    up just where you are,"" Simon Joyner sings on <em>Skeleton
    Blues</em>, his tenth proper album, and it's certainly not the first time that
    Joyner has made it sound as though he's best not left alone with his
    own thoughts.</p><p>
    It seems fortunate then, for him and for us, that on
    this album he's rarely left alone, but has instead the full-time backing of his
    veteran Omaha band the Fallen Men. On such earlier works as 1998's <em>Yesterday,
    Tomorrow and In Between</em> or 2004's <em>Lost With the Lights On, </em>Joyner's
    sparse arrangements could cast his long-winded confessionals with an almost
    sickly, florescent-bulb pallor. Here, though, the Fallen Men feverishly work
    the bellows, pumping these seven overcast tracks full of unruly rock dynamism.
    Though their spirited presence virtually ensures <em>Skeleton Blues</em> to be
    the noisiest album in Joyner's catalog, it also leavens the bleakness of his
    visions enough to also make it his most approachable.</p><p>
    Anchored throughout by Michael Krassner's sturdy piano
    and Lonnie Eugene Methe's additional keyboards, Joyner's chief foils here are
    the pedal steel and guitars of Dave Hawkins and Alex McManus. On expansive
    tracks like ""Open Window Blues"" or ""Medicine Blues"", this
    group announce themselves with a vengeance, their furious electric interchanges
    naturally calling to mind Crazy Horse, as well as the most raucous of Steve
    Wynn's post-Dream Syndicate work, or perhaps a looser, more countrified
    Television. 
    </p>
<p>
    But at the center of the commotion is Joyner and his
    dense, poetic narratives. For several long stretches on <em>Skeleton Blues</em>
    he writes urgent transmissions in the third person, yet this song cycle is too
    uniformly dire and desolate for any real authorial distance. On the apocalyptic
    ""Open Window Blues"" he piles desperate image upon desperate image
    (""The cicadas forever throb on the fringes of the lens/ While I dance upon
    this shifting pile of skeletons"") so thickly his tongue can barely keep
    up. In doing so, he boldly mirrors the breathless cadence of <em>Bringing It All
    Back Home</em>-era Dylan, with the Fallen Men's splintered guitars doing their
    best to keep the comparison flattering. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Medicine Blues"" returns again to these same
    darkened territories, with one eye fixed on the newspaper headlines (""What
    color is the ocean after the oil?""). But Joyner's dread lifts uneasily on
    tracks like the tender country lament ""Answer Night"" and on the
    album's dramatic centerpiece ""The Only Living Boy in Omaha"". Buoyed
    by cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm's graceful string arrangements, this latter track
    is likely the most gorgeous piece Joyner's ever created, a bittersweet
    hymn to the imperfect homesteads we're never fully able to abandon. It's a
    vivid portrait of a place and the lives it contains as a recurring dream, as
    Joyner sings, ""Parades, alcohol, and love's swinging phantoms/ If everything
    rolls around again, does that mean we are free?"" over a veil of strings
    and pedal steel as pure and aching as a late Great Plains rainstorm. 
    </p>
<p>
    As always with a Joyner release, the biggest obstacle
    for many listeners will be his voice. Although at this point he sounds at peace
    with his vocal restrictions, his narrow range leads to melodies that seem like
    shadows or suggestions; as usual, his work practically begs to be
    re-interpreted by a more adventurous or powerhouse vocalist. After the rich
    opulence of ""Only Living Boy"", the album's closing two ballads feel
    somewhat anti-climactic, Joyner's narrators searching once again for a brief
    respite from their downcast isolation, those quiet moments when ""a soft
    light lit in a bedroom can bring a tired traveler to his knees."" Yet with
    the reliable assistance of the Fallen Men, on <em>Skeleton Blues</em> Joyner is
    once again able to devise a good number of such transfiguring moments.

Funny things are often said and
    done, but few rappers are the sort you want telling a story when everyone at a
    party shuts up and listens to just one person. It wasn't always this way (see:
    Redman, Biz Markie, N.O.R.E., and De La Soul). But Plastic Little are the asshole wiseguys you <em>want</em> telling those stories.
    Simultaneously too full of themselves and astoundingly self-aware, all Plastic
    Little do is piss on rap's conventions, sniping at tropes (Black Power rap,
    crowded-club ""bangers,"" Wu-Tang wannabes, gangsta muzik) on their
    debut full-length. They want to amuse each other while infuriating everyone
    else, something they do over impressive approximations of all the sounds

    practice a style Pitchfork contributor Zach Baron has dubbed Gallery Rap, and
    are part of a Philly-BMore-NYC collective I once too-snarkily called the
    Hollertronix Quadrant. That was probably too small a geometric shape to contain

    Stern, aka SQUID, Kurt Hunte, aka No Body's Child (NBC), and Jon Folmar, aka
    Jon Thousand, the Philly-based crew has crafted a funky, confounding debut. The
    Gallery Rap tag is appropriate for Musson, a brilliant posterist whose book, <u><a href=""http://jaysonmusson.com/tooblackforbet.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>Too
    Black For BET</em></a></u>, features some of
    the sharpest, nastiest satire I've seen in a long time. Sometimes <em>She's
    Mature</em>'s satire cuts deep, too. On ""Creative Differences"", they
    skewer conscious dead prez-style hip-hop by self-reflexively dissing Plastic
    Little's debut EP <em>Thug Paradise 2.1</em>. The song spirals into a pro-Nubian
    anthem, sampling KRS-One and dp's ""I'm an African"", with a hook that
    goes ""Grab your shank/ Pull it out/ Kill a cracker."" Bear in mind
    there are two white people in this quartet.
    </p><p>
    ""5th Chamber"" is a strange, spot-on homage to Wu-Tang that lies
    somewhere between adoration and obsession. Later, Wu member Ghostface actually
    shows up in a coup of inexplicable proportions to perform a guest verse on
    ""Crambodia"". The change-up on the beat during his verse signals a
    chop-and-creep job (think Biggie at the end of ""Mo Money, Mo
    Problems""), but he sounds as sprightly as ever against the likes of Amanda
    Blank-- an intriguing if lurid member of the collective-- and the P.L. boys.
    And ""The Jumpoff"" is one the year's truly hilarious parodies
    (""Your Dad's in the Russian mafia? That's the jumpoff!"") 
    </p>
<p>
    But ""1-800-GRUSTLIN"" is too cute for its own good, flipping 70s
    dance craze single ""The Hustle"". Not funny. And ""Beef
    Resolved"" is as dumb as skits get, even if they're trying to mock the
    whole process. Elsewhere, the springy ""Rap O'Clock"" (great title),
    bulging with references to Slytherin and Gondor, sounds like the work of MFA nerds
    in crescent-moon wizard hats. And sometimes there's too much of the showy
    culture-referencing they're so in love with. It's not built to last, even if it
    that's beside the point.
    </p>
<p>
    It's worth noting that for all their love/hate toggling over rap, Plastic
    Little have got an album cover that pays tribute to the Smiths'<em> </em>""This
    Charming Man"" sleeve, and songs that sample ""Heaven Knows I'm
    Miserable Now"" and PJ Harvey's ""Down By the Water"" (on the
    surprisingly aching Diplo-produced ""Now I Hollar""). So there's more
    to them than simple hip-hop snickering. They're art school kids exposed to the
    banality of indie culture, but in love with it, too. They're also guys who
    seemingly watch a lot of porn and enjoy rapping about it. To hear self-loathing
    on a rap record that has nothing to do with regrets about the street life is a
    welcome change-up. If Plastic Little can ever find the balance between incisive
    and acerbic, they're bound to hit on some sort of Spinal Rap masterpiece. Until
    then, at least all the beats are banging.

Gradually building an ever-loyal following, the Swedes flirted with semi-mainstream success around the time of the     concurrently-recorded <i>Deliverance</i>, released in 2002, and <i>Damnation</i>,     which came out a year later. The first found the band in heavy mode; the second     was a set of deathless '70s rock. Blending those two strands excellently, the band's eighth album, 2005's <i>Ghost Reveries</i><i>--</i> now     reissued in a deluxe edition with bonus tracks, a surround sound mix, and a     documentary-- sealed the deal. A carefully crafted set of melodic progressive death-tinged metal, the record made Opeth's past releases feel like tiny sketchbooks for the present.</p>
<p>Much of Opeth's success is due to their charismatic     vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt, whose well-documented idolization of both David Coverdale <i>and</i> Morbid Angel icon Steve Tucker translates surprisingly well to his own music: He can do melody and/or suffocated growls; he's Deep Purple expressive and also raging death dude. In <i>Beyond     Ghost Reveries</i>, the documentary included with this reissue, Åkerfeldt says that after years of honing and experimentation, he once feared he'd     become a ""pussy"" who could no longer manage his ""evil""     growls. Naturally,  he was thrilled to discover that, when needed, he could still conjure that exquisite blackness. And, in fact, even when shifting from folksy hymns to distorted mayhem, the overall feeling of the music     remains dark with a few flickering streaks of light.</p>
<p>Instrumentally, in addition to the usual double-bassdrum action, Opeth blend     prog, jazz, stoner haze, blues-rock, Indian raga, pastoral tips, and     acid-tinged freakers. Newest, sage member Per Wiberg contributes textures,     stuffing his sounds-- a Moog solo here, a Gregorian hum there-- into different     corners using Mellotron, Hammond, and piano. All those keys sometimes create a slight distance, but then the guitars hit the same rhythm as a jazz organ and shape-shift on a dime: The band lulls, then explodes. Unlike a number of other tech wizards embraced by the metal community, Opeth make the most of their skills, playing complexly and expressively. The music is poppier and more sumptuously recorded than Katatonia or Agalloch, but maintains an edge, banging to Amon Düül II. At times you may even be reminded of Japanese psych folk-rockers, Ghost.</p>
<p>Opener ""Ghost of Perdition"" starts with gentle guitar, lasting all of four seconds, before Åkerfeldt begins his hemlock snarl. The next move, before the 1:30 minute mark, is a soulful fusion moment: ""Devil cracked the earthly shell/ Foretold she was the one/ Blew hope into the room and said:/ 'You have to live before you die young.'"" A creepy organ death-dances in the background, facing off a pastoral moment lined with angelic traditional folksy harmonies before an aching solo guitar steps aside for more of the brutal stuff.<i> Ghost Reveries</i>' lyrics never stray far from     these makeshift death pyres. The landscape is feverish, filled with rotting     trees (""roots sucking, thieving from my source""), fog, and darkness.     Protagonists dodge the sun, fear dying alone, and carry their pale flesh     through ashen alien lands.</p>
<p>A complaint could be made that Opeth pack songs-- particularly the opener or     fabulously epic ""Reverie/Harlequin Forest""-- with too many changes. (Dudes, are you trying to get a silver star from <i>Musician</i> magazine?) But each move feels     like it's going somewhere, not simply treading water to showcase chops, and this ADD factor ups the emotional power: Half of <i>Ghost Reveries</i>' eight tracks clock in at over ten minutes, but the word ""lag"" never comes to mind.</p>
<p>Preaching to the converted? If you already own the original, you won't need this reissue     unless you want the smooth cover of Deep Purple's ""Soldier of     Fortune"". Other extras include an embossed cover, added artwork, and pep     rally-style liner notes from Åkerfeldt. There's also a second disc with a 5.1     mix of the album and the ""director's cut"" video for ""The Grand Conjuration"", where a snake sucks a Tawny Kitaen-looking girl down a     toilet and a hooded bully tortures an old guy and douses him with gasoline. And     then there's the 30-something-minute documentary, with standard fare like live     footage, interviews, studio shots, food sculptures, Opeth swimming in a pool,     lap cats, reminiscences, ""sex, drugs, and e-mail,"" lots of talk of     the ""rock-n-roll dream,"" and new tattoos.</p>
<p>At one point in the documentary Åkerfeldt says, revealingly, that what Opeth's doing is     ""more than metal."" That depends, of course, on your definition of metal. People often stress the idea of ""transcending genre"" in relation to the band,     but while forward-thinking and often quite singular, Opeth's still very much within the tradition. That Åkerfeldt thinks     otherwise casts an interesting pattern on the past. It also makes me curious about his recently announced (unnamed) side project and Opeth's ninth studio album (reportedly due before the end of the year).</p></div>"|9717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9717-ghost-reveries-special-edition/|8.4|Brandon Stosuy

    KTL are Sunn0))) guitarist Stephen O'Malley and electronic noisenik/Mego label boss Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg, and the duo's moniker is an abbreviation of <em>Kindertotenlieder</em>, a theatrical collaboration between French performance artist Gisele Vienne and American novelist Dennis Cooper. O'Malley and Rehberg were asked to score the piece, whose title (which translates as ""Songs on the Death of Children"") has a long artistic history. It first emerged as a 425-poem opus written by German poet Freidrich Rückert in 1834 after two of his children died within a few weeks. Later, at the turn of the century, five of those poems were set to an orchestral song cycle by Gustav Mahler.</p><p>
    It's unclear how Vienne and Cooper's performance (set to debut in March of 2007) relates to these works, or whether the music on this album will be involved at all-- according to Mego, this is not the final soundtrack, but rather ""a separate project""-- but if any of KTL's music <em>is</em> used, <em>Kindertotenlieder</em> should be one dark, scary piece of theater. These six tracks lean heavily toward the O'Malley side of KTL's aural spectrum, filled with blackened drones, quaking low end, and elongated sub-metal riffs. Rehberg's contribution is by no means negligible, but he bends his electronic washes and distorted noise to fit O'Malley's unwavering dirges. Fans of each artist will find a lot to drown in here, but <em>KTL</em> is more likely to strike an eternal chord with the Sunn0))) and Southern Lord crowds than with followers of Pita and his Mego cohorts.</p><p>
    Regardless of preference, any listener will be tested by <em>KTL</em>'s opening cut, a 25-minute marathon of barren ambience aptly titled ""Estranged"". Over a distant rumble, the duo adds a few hesitant sounds: slow guitar chords, small slices of noise, and not much else. Those accents, however, are so sparse that it feels as if both men could have left the room during portions of their recording. The track's modicum of hypnotic chill could benefit from theatric visuals, but on record, ""Estranged"" would have worked better as an epilogue (and kind of does, as the shorter album-closing reprise ""Snow"").</p><p>
    Despite that slow beginning, the guts of <em>KTL</em>-- four tracks all titled ""Forest Floor""-- are worth waiting for. Here, O'Malley and Rehberg's individual approaches mesh into a third distinct sound. The overlap between the former's glacial doom and the latter's busy noise gradually increases as each track thickens and expands. ""Forest Floor 1"" collects harrowing screeches like horror-film sound effects isolated into abstraction. On ""Forest Floor 2"", Rehberg doles out cutting jolts that sound like a laptop take on a Wolf Eyes fist-pumper, while ""Forest Floor 3"" strikes a spot-on median between two artistic forces, as O'Malley's massive tones are lapped by the crackling flames of Rehberg's abrasions.  </p><p>
    The ""Forest Floor"" suite makes <em>KTL</em> a success, qualified only by ""Estranged"", and by the hope that the duo continues to work together on future projects. The theatrical work that KTL formed to score certainly seems intriguing, but even more enticing is the possibility that O'Malley and Rehberg might improve upon this fertile first meeting.<br/>

    Febuary 1951. Elliott was 20 years old then, the son of a prominent
    Brooklyn surgeon, and wholly preoccupied with his own overly romantic notions
    of the American west-- cowboys, shotguns, and pickup
    trucks. Elliott (born Elliott Charles Adnopoz) had ditched his family
    for the rodeo when he was 14, changed his name to Buck (and,
    eventually, Jack), and, by mid-1951, returned to New York and taken up
    partial residency in Guthrie's tiny apartment. Guthrie was 40 years
    old, at the end of a tumultuous second marriage, and beginning to show
    signs of Huntington's Disease, a neurodegenerative genetic condition
    that led to his psychosis and, eventually, death. Elliott, by his own
    admission, was a mimic, assimilating Guthrie's vocal tics,
    songbook, and style. According to Guthrie's biographer, Ed Cray,
    Guthrie was flattered, operating by an old Lead Belly dictum: ""I ain't
    gonna show it to ya, but you're welcome to steal it if ya like.""</p><p>
    After Guthrie's death in 1967, Elliott had considerable success
    touring Europe, and released at least a dozen records in America,
    including several collections of Woody Guthrie songs (Elliott was never
    much of a songwriter himself). <em>I Stand Alone</em>, his first since 1999's <em>The Long Ride</em>,
    sees a 75-year-old Elliott pair up with a bunch of contemporary
    musicians (including Corin Tucker, Lucinda Williams, Wilco's Nels Cline, and,
    weirdly, Flea), playing traditional folk songs and cuts by The Carter
    Family, Lead Belly, Ernest Tubb, and Butch Hawes. Elliott's 30-second
    take on Lead Belly's ""Jean Harlow"" is strangely thrilling, while the
    original ""Woody's Last Ride"" pits spare autoharp, windy atmospherics,
    and Elliott's own deliriously weathered speaking voice, as he talks
    through the last time he saw Guthrie, collecting change in a paper beer
    cup in Washington Square Park and using the cash to drive cross-country
    in a Buick. Traditional ""Willy Moore"" (famously recorded by Doc Watson,
    Bill Monroe, and Joan Baez) sounds like a Guthrie outtake, Elliott's voice grizzled and fragile, cracking
    over jumpy strums. <em>I Stand Alone</em> is fleeting and intimate,
    focused, for the most part, on Elliott's salty vocals: His straining, soulful growls on Hoagie Carmichael's famed ""Hong Kong
    Blues"", the strongest track here, are full of spit and swing.</p><p>
    Nearly a decade after Elliott and Guthrie first began playing
    together, a 19-year-old Bob Dylan, fresh from Minnesota, landed
    in New York, playing Guthrie songs and doing his best to sound more like a Dust Bowl survivor than a middle-class Jewish kid from
    Duluth. Dylan was derided for pinching Jack Elliott's appropriation of
    Guthrie (in <em>Chronicles</em>, Dylan talks about meeting folk purist
    Jon Pancake, who told him, ""You better think of something else. You're
    doing it for nothing. Jack Elliott's already been where you are and
    gone."") By the time Dylan managed to weasel his way into Guthrie's
    sickbed, Guthrie was almost unintelligible; nearly everything Dylan
    learned about Guthrie's performance style he picked up from Ramblin'
    Jack Elliott. So in grand folk tradition, Elliott was an essential
    conduit, bringing Guthrie's spirit to the folk revivalists of the early
    1960s. And while Elliott may be most famous for continuing to
    disseminate Guthrie's style (and songbook) long after his death, <em>I Stand Alone</em> is an achievement on its own merits, a charming collection of ancient folk songs perfectly, earnestly rendered.</p></div>"|9648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9648-i-stand-alone/|8.0|Amanda Petrusich

    Since crossing the Atlantic to U.S. shores,  IV Thieves seem to have grown increasingly fond of American democracy. Prior to that, in their hometown of Nottingham, England, the band was more feudal: the
    British release of their debut, <em>The Greatest White Liar</em>, was released
    under singer Nic Armstrong's name. By the time the disc had made it to America
    on New West Records in 2005, they were launched as Nic Armstrong &amp; the
    Thieves. But then they came to Austin, Texas and stayed, ultimately taking to
    awkward American politics for <em>If We Can't
    Escape My Pretty</em>, their second release as a band but their first as
    IV Thieves.</p><p>
    As expected, the democratic approach at least <em>sounds</em>
    better: <em>Liar</em> was largely predicated
    on blues-based British rock, with Armstrong's ostensible Kinks, Beatles, and
    Gallaghers upbringing tempered by a fetishism for sweaty licks and stateside
    tradition. But here, with songwriting credit and vocals split between III of the IV
    Thieves, the group has turned in a rangy
    guitar-pop effort, with attitude taking a backseat to Chris
    ""Frenchie"" Smith's production and polished hooks.</p><p>
    Multiple guitars ricochet through ""Higher"", its swaggering verses and glowing electric textures definitely maybe nodding to the
    colossal moments of <em>Be Here Now</em>.
    ""Take This Heart"" pulses through its verses before it screams into a
    stinging chorus. Trading lines, Armstrong and guitarist Glynn Wedgewood put a
    new coat of lacquer on the Thieves' white-hot stripes. Indeed, the three
    songwriters-- Armstrong, Wedgewood, and bassist Shane Lawlor-- share a
    blue-collar dejection that's unanimous enough to make for simple
    self-government. Slight twists on typical labor-of-love-and-life plights unite
    the dozen tracks: Armstrong lays it out on ""Mother's Love"", moping
    through the lyric ""There's nobody out there/ Nobody cares,"" outlining
    an exhaustive mantra for at least two continents of sad sacks. 
    </p>
<p>
    But it's that least-common denominator, next-generation blues-based rock
    that points both to <em>My Pretty'</em>s
    potentials and failures. Neither a socialist whole nor an anarchist edge survives here, and that lack of conflict takes the edge off. The ends don't
    meet; propulsive, straight-ahead electric guitar rock and hyperactive
    acoustic-based psychedelia remain separated, and the band's entirely orthodox
    chops-- augmented by Smith's stabilizing production-- keep things near the
    middle of the road. 
    </p>
<p>
    Aside from the aforementioned referents, primitive psychedelic rock
    influences-- 13th Floor Elevators, The Nazz, Amboy Dukes-- are set aside in
    favor of direct melodic rock impact. The dynamics have been compressed out of
    most of these tracks, and every guitar solo makes a point not to push too hard.
    Album closer ""Chase Me Off/Out"", unfurling from its tight acoustic
    quarters into a frenzied feedback coda, suggests the band is capable of more. But, like
    any polyarchy, several good ideas (most of the melodies and all of Lawlor's
    basslines) are tempered by plenty of bad ones (the ""ooh
    ay-ohs"" on ""All the Time"" and the <em>Revolver
    </em>brandishing on ""Day is a Downer""). 
    </p>
<p>
    But that's just how playing fair with ideas goes: It's democratic to hear
    them out, even if that means you end up believing that ""You can't love what
    you don't understand"" or eternally doubting dudes who would sing,
    ""Take this heart, make it beat/ I don't remember how to feel"" with
    straight rock faces. Hey, it's a free country.

    When you see a three-piece rock band live, that's all
    you hear: three guys playing and singing. On record, you almost never get that.
    It's much more likely that songs will be piled high with overdubs and
    double-tracked vocals. So <em>Breathless</em>, the first album by the Jet Age,
    winds up being different by virtue of its sheer simplicity-- with only one
    exception, the record sounds exactly like the band would live.</p><p class=""Pitchforkedit0"">
    The trio is led by Eric Tischler, a man whose love of
    the Who is evident in the way he puts a song together, allowing for ample drum
    fills and guitar tangents. Tischler spent years as the nucleus of the Hurricane
    Lamps, who made a series of very raw power-pop albums, and <em>Breathless</em>
    announces his intention to make the Jet Age his rock band. It's not that
    there's no pop songcraft here-- just that Pete Nuwayser's drums get a lot
    of leeway to roam and Tischler reels off a higher than expected number sharp fuzz-tone solos.</p><p class=""Pitchforkedit0"">
    Tischler opens the album with a long peel of cosmic
    lead guitar, but the themes he explores on the record are decidedly more
    terrestrial. His lyrics are full of natural forces, especially weather, and he
    relates them to family and the alternate feelings of safe harbor and
    tumult it can provide. ""See what you thought you could never see/ A home,
    a hearth, a family/ A hundred feet below as you climb/ If you could just touch
    down before you die,"" he sings on ""Sometimes You Win, Sometimes You
    Lose,"" capturing a slice of the mind of someone who never made time for a
    such relationships. 
    </p>
<p class=""Pitchforkedit0"">
    As basic as the sound is, the band does a lot with
    dynamics to keep it interesting. ""Slope"" has gentle, dream-like
    verses, but when it gets to the chorus, the drums slip out of time-keeping
    completely-- the four lines of the chorus are driven forward by nothing but
    drum fills and frenzied guitar strumming with the distortion pedal off.
    Tischler's tendency to stay away from the effects when he's not playing a lead
    keeps things clean and uncluttered. 
    </p>
<p class=""Pitchforkedit0"">
    As fun as it is to hear a rock trio happily bashing
    away, there's evidence that they could do great things with a more produced
    sound on ""Big Deaths, Little Deaths"", the only song with an audible
    overdub. As the track stretches out past five minutes in a quick-tempo buildup,
    Tischler harmonizes wordlessly with several of himselves, and the effect is
    enough to make you wish he'd try it more often. 
    </p>
<p class=""Pitchforkedit0"">
    Whether or not he does, the Jet Age figures to be
    entertaining. Good songs played by a straightforward rock trio will always find
    their way into people's playlists, regardless of what's big at the moment. The
    Jet Age provides exactly that on<em> Breathless</em>.

    not dead, so calm down. If anything, hip-hop is deaf. Rappers, bloggers, and
    fans have become so averse to criticism that the mere title of this album flung
    them into defensive hysterics. So, Nas' plan worked. People are at least
    trying to come up with reasons why hip-hop is indeed alive instead of just
    stealing an album per week and dropping weird science on the internet. He wants
    us to care again, to think when we listen instead of simply consuming, because
    his career and the survival of the culture depend on it. Nas couldn't be a pop
    guy, even with Puff's help. He couldn't write a club song if his life was at
    stake, which, after ""Oochie Wally"" it probably should have been. And he
    certainly isn't going to make any money off his crew (see also: ""Oochie
    Wally""). Nas is a writer, and he needs our attention. He needs us to read
    lines, between the lines, put it all together. He
    needs us to give a fuck about the art, the history, and the craft or we won't
    get what he's saying. Hip-hop isn't dying because Nas hates it; it's dying
    because not enough people love it. If that sounds corny or offensive, well,
    there's the rub, and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Hip Hop Is Dead </span><span>is
    made for you. If you lecture on rap forums all day, post daily pics on your
    blog of Lil' Wayne kissing people, wonder why we write about hip-hop on this
    site, or just want to know what the best rapper alive really sounds like, listen
    to this album.</span></p><p>
    For everyone else, the standard Nas disclaimer: <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Hip Hop
    Is Dead </span><span>is not </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Illmatic</span><span>. Nothing ever will be. Nas and I are roughly the
    same age, so when his debut came out in 1994, it was a humbling experience for
    me. I was struggling through term papers while this slightly older dude from
    Queensbridge was writing the great literature of our generation and
    collaborating with producers I considered legendary. Pete Rock, Gang Starr's DJ
    Premier, Tribe's Q-Tip, and Large Professor of Main Source had produced a dozen
    or more of my favorite albums by the time they worked on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Illmatic</span><span>, and each dropped a gem on Nas, a rookie. (<em>The</em> </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Black
    Album</span><span> was not the dawn of Dream Team
    production.) AZ, the only guest, got one verse on ""Life's a Bitch"", a verse so
    perfect it still haunts him in the same way </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Illmatic</span><span>'s every verse</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span><span>haunts Nas. It's a flawless album, my personal favorite, and I can
    listen to it today and not be bored for a second. Unfortunately, every album
    subsequent to </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Illmatic</span><span> contained
    increasingly longer stretches of boredom, mine and Nas'. Even his recent ""comeback""
    albums (aren't they all?), including the infamous ""Ether""-ing of Jay-Z on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Stillmatic</span>, were better in theory than in practice-- the go-to
    criticism of Nas, his poor taste in beats, holding true for every failure. But,
    he was also getting lazier, less-focused, saying things without
    thinking and probably smoking way too many blunts. It was largely a lost decade
    for Nasir Jones.
    <span></span></p><p>
    When Nas signed with Jay-Z's Def Jam, I didn't guffaw. I
    didn't care. I was happy that Nas was making money, but I didn't believe rumors
    of a Nas/Premier reunion or the Return of Nasty Nas. It was what it was: a
    business deal. Whatever that deal promised Nas, though, pays off on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Hip Hop</span><span> </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Is Dead</span><span>.
    He is, in fact, extremely nasty on almost every track, as committed and
    consistent as he's been in a long time. Beginning with the </span><span class=""postbody"">L.E.S. &amp; Wyldfyer-produced</span><span> royal
    rumbler, ""Money Over Bullshit"", Nas leans into the mic and doesn't fall back
    until he's said his last word on the a capella ""Hope"". The two tracks with
    Kanye West are exceptional for both artists, confirming the chemistry of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Late
    Registration</span><span>'s ""We Major"" and bracketing
    the meditative middle of the album. On either side of that soulful stretch are
    ""Black Republican"", the fantasy duet with Jay, and ""Hustlers"", or, Make-a-Wish
    for the Game. Jay and Nas are so ridiculous on a track together, it's almost
    depressing that it took this long to happen, and the </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Godfather II </span>sample is inspired. The Game, in what should be his
    template, sounds great rapping on a song with the rapper whose name he is
    dropping, especially when it's Nas, whom the Game most closely resembles. The
    closeness of their voices actually makes the Game more tolerable by osmosis.
    <span></span>
</p><p>
    A few of the beats are mediocre, which, again, is Nas'
    Achilles Heel. But if I'm going to talk negatives, it's really only necessary
    to mention one song. Will.i.am produced three on the album, and all of them, at
    least his contribution to them, are decent to good. However, ""Who Killed It?"",
    Will's odd nursery-noir beat, is the worst concept song in the history of
    hip-hop music. Normally, I'm with Nas any time he wants to inhabit a
    persona or inanimate object, but here he assumes the voice of-- I shit you
    not-- character actor Edward G. Robinson (kids: think Chief Wiggum). The first time I heard it, I
    was genuinely shocked. The content is irrelevant. Truly, deeply embarrassing,
    but that's what the delete key is for, people. Let's hope it was the Black Eyed
    Pea's idea.
    </p>
<p>
    At least Nas is trying again, though. He's pushing himself,
    and that's what his appeal has always been. He's a virtuoso MC, but
    it has never been about style over substance or dazzling technique. Don't get
    me wrong, there are verses on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Hip Hop </span><span>in
    which he rattles off minute-long torrents with more internal rhymes than Rick
    Ross had rhymes </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">in toto</span><span> on his
    album. But Nas is telling stories again and attacking the mic, and that is what
    is important. While his successors might impress with intricate wordplay, too
    often they're just saying what's on their minds instead of getting something
    off their chests. Maybe that's what Nas means by </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Hip Hop Is Dead</span>, that the art of rhyme is lost, but he also must
    accept some of the blame that he liberally places on others. It was his lack of
    effort, after all, that created a vacuum for others to fill with emptiness.
    </p>
<span></span>
<p>
    In the end, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Hip Hop Is Dead</span><span> is the album I'll give to people in 20 years when they ask who Nas
    was. More than </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Illmatic</span><span>,</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">
</span><span>it represents the real Nas-- not the
    ideal-- the MC with all the skill, all the rhymes, and all the insight who sabotaged himself with bad decisions. There aren't too many here, which is why I'll recommend
    it. Whether he will revive hip-hop or not is for history to decide; I'm not
    sure it needs reviving. The need for Nas to play a vital role in whatever
    happens, though, is something I am sure of, so I'm glad he's back with the living.</span>

For starters there was the Postcard version, label boss Alan Horne's vision of the group as the neat Edinburgh spirit to spike the sparkling Glasgow pop of Orange Juice. Then there's Paul Morley's account (reprised in his sleevenotes here): If OJ were a New York band who formed in Glasgow, then JK were a Manchester band who'd been dislocated to Edinburgh-- troubled heirs of Joy Division, stylish peers of Magazine. Then, of course, there's the sharp-suited puritans you might read about in the works of Kevin Pearce, the mod missing link between the crooning Vic Godard and the shambling June Brides. And that's just a step away from the twee indie-pop slant: Josef K as the jagged romantics who essentially invented the Wedding Present. And more recently there's been the Franz Ferdinand angle: Josef K as the band who dreamt up the smartly spiky pop that married the stark expressionism of CBGBs to a suave Frank Sinatra sigh before the Strokes were even struck.</p><p>
    Domino have profited greatly from the success of this last invocation, so it's to their credit that they've issued this terrific 22-track introduction to Josef K-- remarkably, the first time the group's work has been properly available in the U.S. It takes us from the 1980s Postcard single ""Radio Drill Time"" through generous selections from the abandoned album <em>Sorry for Laughing</em> and the actual debut <em>The Only Fun in Town</em>, before concluding with their parting 1981 Peel Sessions and a strangely successful cover of Alice Cooper's ""Applebush"". In part, it's the misfiring brevity of their career-- barely two years from debut to farewell-- that encourages the proliferation of Josef K myth. Disbanded in their prime before they grew stale or flat, they still feel pregnant with promise, tantalizingly unfinished; like an actor cut down in youth, they've remained an irresistible lure to the imagination of pop romantics ever since.</p><p>
    On the two Postcard singles released in winter 1980 you can hear a young group trying to struggle out of the shadow of Joy Division, away from the post-punk abyss of Ian Curtis's suicide earlier that year. ""Radio Drill Time"" is an urgent, slightly gauche stab at a Martin Hannett soundworld, all martial drums, a reverbed scree of guitars, and startling electronic bleeps, with the usual suspects of JD iconography-- trance, radios, motorways-- rounded up one last time; as Paul Haig wails nervily, ""it's the wrong place to start."" ""It's Kind of Funny"", issued just two months later, shows real progress and the beginnings of a distinctive Josef K voice: Haig now croons swoonily of existential futility-- Sinatra meets Sartre via the Subway Sect-- while Malcolm Ross and the band hit on a groove like Tom Verlaine slashing through ""Pale Blue Eyes"".
    </p><p>
    But the real draw here are the six selections from <em>Sorry For Laughing</em>-- the debut album that should have been released at the start of 1981 as the momentum of The Sound of Young Scotland hype built to a head, but was instead mysteriously shelved, apparently after thousands of copies had already been produced. You could easily believe this was one of Horne's gloriously perverse, self-defeating bids for pop immortality-- an instant great lost classic (and a steady income stream from supposedly rare test pressings). More prosaically, it's possible that the group were intimidated by the furious energy and intensity brewing within fellow Edinburghers the Fire Engines and felt their recordings now seemed too prim, poised, and proper in comparison. As it survives, the album sees the group expanding into a kind of postpunk art rock: ""Heads Watch"" is a kissing cousin of Magazine's ""Shot by Both Sides"" while ""Variations on a Scene"" unfurls into a low-slung and slinky arrangement for piano, flute, and arcade game electronics. But it also suggests a possible New Pop future for the group, producing the kind of kosmische kabaret that kindred spirits the Associates were to take briefly and brilliantly to the top of the charts (as it happened, the closest we would get to this ideal was Propaganda's stately synth-pop cover of ""Sorry For Laughing"" in 1985).
    </p>
<p>
    The eventual debut, <em>The Only Fun in Town</em>, was recorded in six days in a Belgian studio in an attempt to capture their live clangor but released in July 81 to abysmal reviews from their most ardent fans: Morley wrote in the NME: ""I am appalled…Josef K have cheapened themselves and cheated the world"". Heard now TOFiT is certainly no disaster-- there's an unhinged vigor to ""Fun'n'Frenzy"" and ""16 Years"" that has proved incredibly influential over two decades of British indie-- but there's an inescapable falling off in intrigue, with all the mystery, wit, and languor reduced to bright, brittle blasts of alienation.
    </p>
<p>
    This most abstemious of groups was to split within the year, after a taste of the promotional treadmill beat any remaining idealism out of them: Haig to an intermittently fascinating solo career on the dark side of the croon, Ross to a more commercial incarnation of Orange Juice, and Weddell and Torrance to join a youthful Momus in the Happy Family. 
    </p>
<p>
    The cover and insecty title of this anthology alludes to the source of the group's name in Kafka, but also carries an elusive allusion to Manny Farber inventing Termite Art back in 1962: ""the concentration on nailing down one moment without glamorizing it …forgetting this accomplishment as soon as it has been passed; the feeling that all is expendable, that it can be chopped up and flung down in a different arrangement without ruin"". <em>Entomology</em> is exemplary termite art: A brief moment and a handful of songs that have burrowed industriously through the soil of the last twenty years, while so many white elephants have fallen ponderously away, and now finally come triumphantly to light.<br/>

    The opening moments of <em>Shine Through</em> are a bit of a trick. The
    first song, ""Whole World"", starts with chilly, desolate keyboards, then a dash
    of sci-fi synths. It sounds like an iceberg-- an odd choice for one of the
    year's warmest albums. Aloe Blacc is a Southern California-born multitasker. He
    sings, raps, plays trumpet and piano on his formal solo debut-- sometimes all during
    the same song. And he's managed to weave his broad vision of music,
    encompassing salsa and broken-beat and hip-hop and 70s-style soul, into an
    optimistic, effervescent piece of bedroom studio miscellany.</p><p>
    Twenty-seven-year-old E. Nathaniel Dawkins, best known as the rapping
    half of longtime hip-hop duo Emanon with DJ Exile, doesn't yet have the songwriting
    chops to sustain a sprawling 16-song effort like this, but
    his flashes of keen musical interpolation signal some sort of greatness.
    Whether turning Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" (here called ""Long Time Coming"") into a strung-out funhouse
    mirror cover or not getting caught up in the icky meta-ness of recording a song
    called ""Busking"" at a bus stop whilst busking, Blacc is clearly willing to take
    risks. But the post-salsa jaunt ""Bailar-- Scene I"" and ""Patria Mia"", a
    dedication to his parents' home country of Panama,
    are steeped in traditional styles, recorded without camp or irony. His
    admiration for institutions is audible. And ""Nascimento (Birth)-- Scene II"", an
    ode to Brazilian sweet-voiced samba icon Milton Nascimento, is a subdued forum
    for his majestic Terence Blanchard-esque trumpet playing. But this is more than
    that. The unadorned title track is more than just an interlude, it's the
    warning shot of a Mayfield-in-the-making, his stunning falsetto on full display
    despite bargain-basement recording.</p><p>
    Strangely, the moments that feel forced or contrived only pop
    up when Blacc decides to rap, the genre that got him started in the first place.
    The closing moments of ""Caged Birdsong"" feature a rapped verse that reveals a
    forceful tone absent throughout the rest of this delicate work. Same goes for
    the sexually aggressive verse on ""Want Me"". It's a stark contrast to the
    soaring ""One Inna"", one of the year's truly resplendent soul songs. Madlib
    provides his label mate with an atypical construction-- the drums are tuned way
    down and a xylophone melody bounces around under Blacc's tender crooning.
    Lyrically the song lacks ingenuity, though it rings true-- how often are we
    able to articulate how we feel about someone we love without clichés or catchphrases?
    </p>
<p>
    Aloe Blacc's really crept up on me this year, presenting
    himself at first as a genre oddball, unsure of where he wants to take his
    sound. Then he seemed merely an aesthete, unable to wrangle his loves into a
    cohesive whole. But time has uncovered a feeling composer unbound to the rigors
    of formatting. And while <em>Shine Through</em> has some fat on its edges, there's at
    least anticipation now for a new sort of soul artist-- one unafraid to pierce
    an otherwise rigid genre's decaying convention.

    Forget chestnuts and nog. The close of the calendar year is
    a time for rifling through the past twelve months and catching up on all the
    records you either didn't pay enough attention to or slept on entirely.
    Released with a whimper in February, Tiga Sontag's <em>Sexor</em> probably falls under that banner for a lot of people. While
    the Montreal DJ has long enjoyed renown among clubgoers as a top-tier supplier
    of slithery, trashy electro (check his 2002 <em>DJ-Kicks</em> mix for proof), this marks
    the first original outing of his career.</p><p>
    Released on Canada's Last Gang Records-- best known for
    breaking the likes of Death From Above 1979, Metric, and MSTRKRFT-- <em>Sexor</em> finds Tiga atoning for the silence
    with a series of bangers, skits, and-- in keeping with a longstanding tradition
    that's seen him try his hand at everything from Nelly's ""Hot in Herre"" to fellow
    Montrealer Corey Hart's ""Sunglasses at Night""-- a fresh handful of cover
    treatments.  The bad news is that <em>Sexor</em> feels a bit forced,
    a bit sellotaped together.  Where
    Sontag's singles and remixes are generally pretty immaculate, you can sense his
    anxiety over the long-form format here. Everything from the album's
    loosely-conceived conceptual overlay (Sexor is apparently a planet where
    ""imagination rules the nation"" and ""sexy lightning always strikes twice"") to its
    light smattering of voicemail excerpts and telephone conversations points to his
    willingness to kowtow to long-player conventions. While it's clear from the
    tracks' compact running times that he's trying to keep things concise and
    poppy, he might have been better served by instead letting some of these songs unfurl
    and build.</p><p>
    Nonetheless, with co-production courtesy of Soulwax and
    Jesper Dahlback, there's also lots to like here. With a bassline containing trace
    amounts of ""Material Girl"" and an insidious little chorus, ""Far From Home"" proves
    Sontag fluent in effervescent, 80s-tinged synthpop. Elsewhere, Scissor Sisters'
    Jake Shears tags along for the snaking, sweaty electro of ""You Gonna Want Me"", ""Brothers""
    conquers a silly lyric with a convincing New Order impression, and ""Good As
    Gold"" finds Tiga and producers Soulwax channeling their inner James Murphys to
    deliver the album's only real epic. Even the covers yield decent returns.
    Despite being originally released in 2004, Tiga's drastically retooled version
    of Public Enemy's ""Louder Than a Bomb"" makes strange sense here; perhaps even
    more surprising is that he also manages to wring genuine atmosphere out of a slowed-to-a-crawl
    take on Nine Inch Nails' ""Down in It"".</p><p>
    Ultimately though, too much of <em>Sexor</em> feels suspiciously like the middle of the road. If it doesn't
    bump enough, slink enough, or sing enough, what good is it? Tiga's capable of
    better than this, and his discography bears that fact out; the good news is
    that he's reportedly working with Soulwax on a followup. That he's not waiting
    another five years for the next album has to bode well.

    do, really), but if done particularly well, a score can shuffle a few
    feet forward, extending a moment or a visual sequence. Many of the most memorable soundtracks aren't technically the best
    cinematic accouterments: They over-step, bully, transcend, tread on, and bleed through the moving image.</p><p>
    When it comes to film
    music, I'm nailed by cultural nostalgia, moved by the weird and the obvious-- say, Jesus &amp; Mary Chain at the end
    of <em>Lost in Translation</em>. Too easy, but I once spent an entire summer listening to <em>Darklands</em>.
    I've never been to Japan and ""Just Like Honey""'s on a different record, but that final
    whispered moment between the leads still taps and taps (and taps), overlapping
    with the feeling of leaning my head against a fan, hearing how it mutated the
    street noises, zoning out to ""April Skies"" anyway. Would it have been as cinematically successful if Coldplay blasted from the screen at that moment? Maybe, but I
    would've missed the shivers.</p><p>
    Of course, too much of a good thing can hurt.
    Occasionally, a resonance hovers so close to home it repels. For instance, Elliott
    Smith accompanying that Hollywood suicide attempt in <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>. I lived in Portland when he put out those early records;
    saw him all over the place with Heatmiser; had a girlfriend who cried
    listening to his stuff even then. Now? You can't listen to the stuff
    now-- or, at least, not easily. So it's painful when it's paired with something so
    cartoonish.
    All this to say: What's interesting about <em>The Fountain</em> soundtrack is just how uninteresting the music is, really. OK, that's not exactly right. When it swells and drives toward the end of ""Holy
    Dead!"", it's
    gorgeous. The windiness of ""Death Is the Road to Awe"", just before the percussion and choir pick up, is equally excellent. The repeated and echoing motifs? A fine touch. But I've concentrated hard
    on the minor chords, pressed ""play"" dozens of times, retread the bowing
    and kneeding and bubbling percussion, and it still doesn't do much more than stay perfectly within the lines of the film
    for which it was composed.  It's a good, well-behaved soundtrack full of classicist, string-led
    flourishes. So, pretty, yes. Reminiscent of summers spent stocking
    shelves in the
    music section of Borders and helping old ladies locate the <em>Lawrence of
    Arabia</em> soundtrack?  Hell yes.  <br/>
</p><p>
    The movement -- and it is a movement, always moving and propelling-- was
    written by ex-Pop Will Eat Itself member Clint Mansell, who also
    soundtracked Darren Aronofsky's <em>Requiem For a Dream</em> and <em>Pi</em>. Here, the 46 plaintive minutes of music are elegantly interpreted by the Kronos Quartet and Mogwai. Yes, that Mogwai. The
    Scottish mopes, along with bands like Godspeed You Black Emperor
    (adjust the exclamation point accordingly), are often referred to as
    ""cinematic"" because their songs move a certain way, pushing a path of
    easy dynamics. It can be interesting, for sure, but it's obvious: They
    churn up images via emotive rising/falling actions. If you own an iPod
    or a Walkman and take a journey to the corner bodega, the world feels 10 time more dramatic. In those cases, there's no need for a
    preexisting film: Your head becomes the flicker. 
    </p>
<p>
    I guess
    that's the big letdown about this collection: Mogwai's outside albums would've
    been more compelling. What we have is so predetermined, so closed...so
    obviously a soundtrack. I prefer soundtracks for the
    nonexistent, where you're forced to conjure, or otherwise work for the
    image. Or, as mentioned way at the top, music in a film that has a life
    for you outside the film. If you watch <em>The Fountain</em> enough,
    untangle its meaning, learn to love it like a friend, then this music
    might become that emotional headlock. But a hunch: I
    could play 10 other similar soundtracks and you'd have a difficult
    time passing the Pepsi Challenge.

    If any rapper could release two staggering hip-hop albums in
    one year, it's Ghostface. But he's not pulling off that feat with <em>More Fish</em>. With March's <em>Fishscale</em>, the Wu's most vital warrior once
    again restated his relevance with a dense, engrossing LP complemented by an equally stellar
    live show. Matching Ghost's excitement, Def Jam seemed to throw their full weight
    behind the project-- with a slick video featuring Ne-Yo, tracks from Just Blaze
    and J Dilla, and eye-popping photo shoots in countless glossies-- but the

    million-seller.) Tucked away beneath the label's fourth-quarter
    heavy-hitters, <em>More Fish</em> is, appropriately, a fraction of the event <em>Fishscale</em> was. And while new
    material from one of the most consistent rappers of all time is always welcome,
    the new album's stealth release doubles as an admission of Ghost's limited
    commercial potential. The redundant title alone-- here ya go, <em>More Fish</em>!-- goes
    lengths to lower expectations.</p><p>
    The new record isn't really Ghost's sixth solo album as
    much as it's a follow-up to 2004's Theodore Unit disc, <em>718</em>; the production is
    solid yet rarely electrifying and the record is packed with guest spots from the
    rapper's markedly less-gifted clique. It's a glorified mixtape with Ghostface
    strafing hard to reach his peak game at times, but it obviously pales in comparison to its touted
    sister album.</p><p>
    As much as I can't help but cringe a little when T-Unit
    also-rans eat up valuable track time on <em>More Fish</em>, it's difficult to deny the
    underdog appeal of Ghost's crew. Second in command, Trife Da God, has vastly
    improved as a lyricist over the years-- as proven here on the twisting drug-lord narrative
    ""Miguel Sanchez""-- though his flat Ghostface Jr. flow still lacks the
    edgy emotion that defines his mentor's appeal. Trife is passable on posse cuts,
    but he can't hope to sustain ""Grew Up Hard"", his solo spotlight. Sun
    God (Ghost's actual son-- what I'd give to be an ant in the floorboards during family dinners) continues to impress with a blustery delivery that sounds more like a conglomerate of several Wu
    styles-- a little RZA, a little Inspektah Deck, a little Masta Killa-- than a straight DNA-rip. And on the
    father-son duet ""Street Opera"", featuring an excellent Michael
    Jackson-sampling track from up and comer Fantom of the Beat, the kid totally
    holds his own. 
    </p>
<p>
    Veteran Theodore affiliates Cappadonna, Redman, and Sheek
    Louch all make the most of their brief appearances, with Red reminding everyone
    that he is indeed alive on ""Greedy Bitches"", his elastic playfulness
    intact (""Broke nigga?/ No bitch, you got it wrong,"" he quips,
    ""I'm still spendin' from Red and Meth sitcom""). C-listers Killa Sin
    and Shawn Wigs slow <em>More Fish</em>'s momentum when they're allowed at
    the mic, though the Wigs showcase ""Pokerface""-- a comically specific
    No Limit Hold'em tutorial-- suggests the pitiful MC may have a lucrative
    gambling career in his future. 
    </p>
<p>
    So basically, all the album's guests are past their peak or have zero chance of releasing a major
    label rap album of their own, and
    there's a certain charm to the fact that these anti-star rappers are just rhyming to
    rhyme. But even with all his ancillary affiliates to distract him, Ghost pulls through with some verses that snap your head around and reiterate
    his lofty stature. He breaks out the unrelenting diehard guise on ""Ghost Is
    Back"", a flip on Eric B. and Rakim's ""Juice (Know the Ledge)""
    that has the rapper free-associating for three minutes nearly uninterrupted.
    Fluffy
    anomalies ""Good"" and ""You Know I'm No Good"", with Brit belter
    Amy Winehouse, provide some well-placed levity amidst the album's gutter-soul
    bleakness, but it's when Ghost delves into the popping synapses of his own
    mind that we get the best of <em>More Fish</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Outta Town Shit"", which
    chronicles a Minnesota dice game gone awry with paranoid humor, and ""Alex (Stolen Script)"" are two bulletproof narratives that'd have woven nicely into <em>Fishscale</em>'s series of short stories. Over a
    scratchy, cheeseball-noir MF Doom track, ""Alex"" weaves a tall
    tale about a would-be screenwriter who has a rendezvous with a Hollywood bigwig
    at P.F. Chang's and talks to Ray Charles about casting Jamie Foxx in <em>Ray</em>-- its
    imagination levels are off the charts. And it's exactly where we want Ghost to be. While <em>More Fish</em> is far from worthless, it's still a diluted product. And that's the problem with setting the bar so
    high with <em>Supreme Clientele</em> or <em>Fishscale</em> or ""Alex (Stolen Script)""--
    it's just that much more obvious when the bar isn't reached.

So it's no surprise that their greatest hits, arriving after only three     album's worth of singles, is as exhausting     as it is captivating, a whirlwind trip through bizarre but lovable pop     gadgetry that may leave the uninitiated reeling.</p>
<p>The story of Girls Aloud is     as much the story of Xenomania, the reclusive pop production team whose vision     shines through every song here. The performers remain a key ingredient,     demonstrating an impressive knack for perfectly executing the demands of their     material. If I don't know who is who and who does what, it's largely because     their strident, at times obnoxious, performances rarely slip up enough for me to     wonder. Their brief is to be snotty sirens, delivering reference-laden     one-liners with their tongues stuck firmly in their cheeks. One-liners they are: While Girls Aloud are frequently blessed with excellent lyrics, their     clever allusions are usually more amusing than affecting, with only the     unalloyed spite and frustration of early classic ""No Good Advice"" and the     gentle tenderness of recent ballad ""Whole Lotta History"" really cutting     through.</p>
<p>But Girls Aloud don't need     to steal my heart when the rest of me has already been seduced by their     deathless hooks and multi-genre pyrotechnics, starting from new wave drum &amp;     bass and expanding to embrace elements of electroclash, big beat, and even     skiffle, in songs stuffed to the gills with two, three, sometimes four different     choruses, sounding like patchwork assemblages of the best bits of a hundred     fantasy pop songs, smoothly and effortlessly changing gears at a moment's     notice.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of     the Girls Aloud/Xenomania combination is the sense of simpatico which allows     the respective parties to push themselves further than they would otherwise-- the only faltering moments here are the straightforward covers of the Pointer     Sisters' ""Jump (For My Love)"" and the     Pretenders' ""I'll Stand By You"", uncharacteristic crises of confidence in the     unpredictable pop nous of the partnership. Always good for a chorus, the risk     for Girls Aloud and their producers is that of stagnation: The three new songs' churning, steroid-pumped electro-pop (think Bananarama meets     Transvision Vamp) is enjoyable but also less startling than before, a     refinement of an already perfected blueprint. Having come to rely on Girls Aloud     outflanking them at every term, fans are unlikely to be inclined to settle for     less.</p>
<p>The Sugababes are frequently     touted as the most edgy, subversive UK pop group, although beyond their     brilliant collaboration with Richard X on a Numan-sampling cover of Adina     Howard's ""Freak Like Me"", their unsmiling façades, and frequent lineup changes,     it can be hard to see why: The trio's songs are generally more in line with     broader trends in pop or r&amp;b than Girls Aloud's polystylistic romps, their     lyrics usually more pedestrian. The kernel of truth to the critical line cum marketing angle lies in the group's vocals, which     make a good argument for them being the best pop act of this decade--  perhaps     less startling than Girls Aloud, but finally more endearing.</p>
<p>Initially dominated by the     indie fragility of Siobhan Donaghy, the Sugababes only really hit their stride     after her sudden exit following their first (and weakest) album <i>One Touch</i>, whose hesitant r&amp;b-for-bedsits at least     resulted in fantastically winsome singles. The reformed lineup was more     confident and expansive, powered by its delicate balancing of Keisha Buchanan's sweet     clarity, Siobhan-replacement Heidi Range's trembling diva grandeur, and the unadorned     husky simplicity of the recently departed Mutya Buena, whom Xenomania's Brian Higgins     claimed (perhaps correctly) was the UK's finest pop vocalist since Dusty     Springfield.</p>
<p>Names are important here: While the singers of Girls Aloud are perfectly aligned with their song's     intentions, the Sugababes' personalities constantly exceed the borders of     their own material, only to dissolve into empathetic chorus harmonies. Sweetly     girlish early on, these harmonies have become majestic and at times unabashedly     emotional; while people may remember the group for their frothy pop (""Freak Like     Me"", ""Hole in the Head"", ""Push the Button""), their greatest hits collection <i>Overloaded</i> is equally impressive for its devastatingly earnest     balladry.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, many of their finest efforts were never chosen as     singles, but then it appears that Sugababes, in all their incarnations, have     never quite understood their own strengths, stumbling into brilliance by     accident and almost as regularly going off the rails. Never more so than today:     Mutya's replacement Amelle Berrabah simply sounds like a throatier facsimile of her     predecessor, and while in principle there's no reason for her not to succeed as     Heidi has, for a group whose charms are so precariously positioned, she might     also be the fatal tipping point. The two new songs on <i>Overloaded</i> reveal the pitfalls of reading your own press, with     the group attempting to reverse engineer the brand of cool that is commonly given to them via a limpid and largely     tuneless rock-pop hybrid. Some of their collaborators     know what they don't: Xenomania's four technicolor singles here portray a     group so triumphantly insouciant they can afford to make pure, unashamed pop,     improbably balancing disaffectedness with conviction.

    modernisms.<span> </span>Referring to an antiquated
    vision of the future is easy, but finding and expanding upon that timeless
    kernel of forward-thinking excitement and systematic rigor is no small
    feat.<span> </span>It comes as little surprise to me that
    at least one member of Brooklyn eight-piece
    Mahogany are involved in the world of architecture-- <em>Connectivity! </em>is as much a structural achievement as it is a simply
    gorgeous record, cultivating a graceful, time-collapsing sense
    of modernity.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Therein lies the greatest difference between Mahogany and
    most bands who have been fitted with the ""neo-shoegazer"" tag: <span></span>Unlike many of their reverb-loving
    contemporaries, Mahogany never fall back on atmospherics alone.<span> </span>As gorgeous as these sounds are, they always
    seem to have a place within the greater plan of the song-- nothing on <em>Connectivity!</em> registers as unnecessary
    or obstructive.<span> </span>Rather than playing
    towards a sense of impenetrable mystery, <em>Connectivity!</em>
    lays out its inner workings like a well-made machine.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Opener ""Tesselation (Formerly Plateau One)"" could
    set the scene for a futuristic city at work-- drum machine beats skitter and
    shuffle alongside simple, repeated figures on piano and guitar.<span> </span>Even the vocals are broken up into short,
    efficient geometric phrases.<span> </span>The song
    evolves intuitively, if not organically, building layer upon layer of blips,
    synthesizers, and staggered boy-girl singing.<span>
</span>The short, upbeat ""The View From the People Wall"" and first single
    ""Supervitesse"" are particularly successful iterations of a similar formula.<span> </span>A straightforward and unaffected vocal style
    flatters most of the band's material, but when the melodies falter, <em>Connectivity!</em> can seem a little too neat
    and well-oiled for its own good.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The latter parts of the record are less rhythmically rigid and
    darker in tone.<span> </span>""Domino Ladder Beta""
    sounds like a long-lost Arthur Russell outtake, all gorgeous cello, minimal
    percussion and reverb-drenched vocals. <span> </span>""Springtime, Save Our Country"" showcases the
    band's impressive use of harmonic tension to create mood and movement.<span> </span>By song's end, vocal figures repeat and
    double back on themselves, eventually dissolving into a beautiful fog of synthesizers
    and sleigh bells.<span> </span>Stereolab and
    Broadcast comparisons are obvious and by no means off-base, but the sonics and
    melodic turns of <em>Connectivity! </em>also
    bring to mind the Notwist and <em>Security</em>-era
    Peter Gabriel.<span> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The second disc of <em>Connectivity!</em>
    includes two alternate mixes done by the Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie as well
    as a lengthier mix of ""Supervitesse"".<span> </span>Guthrie's
    participation in <em>Connectivity!</em> gives
    the album an air of credibility, but Mahogany never really attempt the otherworldly
    beauty of the Cocteaus.<span> </span>While <em>Connectivity! </em>is a gorgeous record, it
    tends to err towards the neat, the structural, and the logical.<span> </span>Indeed, the album's central tension ultimately
    constrains its emotional range and resonance-- <em>Connectivity</em>! is stuck between the ethereal and the
    mechanical. <span> </span>It's not a flaw per se, but
    rather a slight limitation built into a masterfully executed structure.

    critics have mistakingly labeled Horse Feathers-- the Portland, Ore.,
    duo of
    Justin Ringle and Peter Broderick-- another folksy Americana troupe
    with an interesting vocalist. Broderick, a talented 19-year-old
    multi-instrumentalist, certainly adds
    folk instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and saw to emotive, gothic
    backdrops; he also accents Ringle's quavery, near-falsetto with cello,
    piano, viola, violin, and various sorts of almost-funky percussion.
    Ignore the chatter-- there's something a bit more avant going on here.</p><p>
    The two approach music rustically, but the
    Iron &amp; Wine name-checks are off the mark-- there's a different vibe
    and pacing and phrasing entirely. You could snag some Sam Beam beard curls on ""Dustbowl"", but what to do
    with the truly swinging send-out of ""Falling Through the Roof""? Or
    ""Untitled"", a quiet bit of chamber piano that makes me think of a
    slow, sad, last waltz? Same goes for the syrupy keyed'n'bowed
    ministrations of ""Like Lavender"".</p><p>
    Ringle, who contributes guitar, banjo, and some percussion in addition
    to his arresting voice, is reminiscent of John Orth from Holopaw;
    there's something more gorgeously unhinged, though-- not mentally, but
    the way he sings with his entire body. You keep thinking he'll crack.
    At times, his pronunciations come out like a male Chan Marshall-- but on a bit too much caffeine.
    Listening to ""Honest Doubters"" from a distance, I heard the ghost of
    Jeff Mangum or Arthur Russell (a real ghost) via Kelley Polar.</p><p>
    In the end, forget the RIYL one-sheet copy
    and instead absorb a fragment of ""Like Lavender""'s track marks: ""Some things
    always stay the same/ How you looked wet from all the rain/ Like
    lavender the small of your hair, silly errs postponing your despair.""
    Follow this with a small, stringed flourish to complete the silent
    epiphany. The ambiance of the album is great: ""Hardwood Pews"" rapidly builds from
    bedroom hush (and blush) to saw-bent crescendo. ""Blood on the Snow""
    lists body parts in a somber parade-- ""Their heads, their lips, their
    chests, their hips, they walk. Them bones they move, they talk. Their
    bones they bleed they rot""-- a deep-pool cello acting as slithery
    metronome.</p><p>
    Lyrically, Ringle's fond of thorny repetitions: ""Goodnight, night,
    night"" or ""Like how her bark, it has calmed before her bite, bite,
    bite."" These extra words add an emphasis, but also keep the libretto
    moving. For such a sweetly
    silent (but always swiveling) set, there's a ton of activity:
    ""Walking and running, sucking and fucking at your will. You won't
    debate us, nor entertain us. It's your thrill."" A truck-full of action
    verbs:
    ""they move, they touch."" Gathering bruises, there are trips to Heaven
    and Hell (and, well, Hades). Tongues ""taste the sky."" The boys hop a
    little waltz, tumbling through a bruised roof.  Sometimes Ringle makes
    his voice quaver
    intentionally, stuttering with his tonsils.</p><p>
    Amid the blood, snow, sawdust, roses (""bones may break, parts go on
    bleeding""), the body's breakdown is seen as but another way to move.
    Worms singing in your guts, creating air holes-- you, yourself, become
    an instrument. Maybe this gets at what
    the album's title means to say: It's okay words are dead because
    they'll find newer forms within their decomposition. Whatever the case,
    Horse Feathers just keep moving (in both senses of the
    word...).</p></div>"|9689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9689-words-are-dead/|7.5|Brandon Stosuy

Yes, more often than not they are slow and sonorous and prone to the sort of overly dramatic swooning associated with silent film actresses, but they strike these poses skillfully.  That doesn't make listening to an hour's worth of such posing in one setting any easier, though.  If you're not in the mood, the group's attempts to establish this painstaking beauty and emotional heft will grate very quickly.  For those in the audience hoping for a little more variety in Hem's diet, <em>Funnel Cloud</em> is the album for you.  In addition to offering generous helpings of the usual Hem fare, the group delve deeper into the country side of countrypolitan.  They even up their tempo from time to time, which is a nice change of pace for a group prone to drowning every song they touch in a gallon of ether.  There's no doubt that it's the group's most accomplished album-- unfortunately, it's also their most disappointing.</p><p>
    I imagine most folks would save the ""most disappointing"" appellation for the group's second album, <em>Eveningland</em>.  It's overblown, over-orchestrated, bombastic, ponderous, portentous, and all that jazz.  It's what Hem does best, and it's what makes the album great.  At their best, Hem lay the syrup on thick, and they give themselves over to that sticky bittersweetness just enough.  The melodies bloom like flowers breaking through the early spring frost, the orchestral backing swells and ebbs with tidal inevitability, and throughout it all, Sally Ellison's pristine plain-as-Jane voice acts as a tether that keeps this bombast from blowing away.  Here's the rub: Despite the hokey grandeur of Hem's usual MO, it's at their most overblown that Hem sounds most true to itself.</p><p>
    On <em>Funnel Cloud</em>, the strength of these grandiose moments is dispelled by these out-of-character, down-to-earth moments, and it casts both the new and the old in unflattering lights.  Which is to say that while Ellison sounds at home amidst the somber piano and guitar backing of ""We'll Meet Along the Way"", she sounds strained and uncomfortable with the aw-shucks candor of ""The Pills Stopped Working"" and the awkwardly anthemic ""Not California"".  Heart-string tugging showtunes like ""Great Houses of New York"" paint a beautiful, wistful portrait.  The more showy arrangements of tracks like ""Curtains"", on the other hand, distract and detract.  And this less-than-smooth style switching makes the album's modest length of forty-six minutes seem much longer than the hour-plus length of its predecessor.  In this light, the title of the album's final track, ""Almost Home"", might be a more fitting name for this album.  Ultimately, <em>Funnel Cloud</em> is the work of a band searching for new ways to sing.  They might get where they want eventually, but, if this is any evidence, it's going to be a bumpy ride.</p></div>"|9709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9709-funnel-cloud/|6.1|David Raposa

    Taken like a spoonful of Nyquil just before you pass out from flu
    exhaustion, nostalgia is no harm at all. In fact, it's positively uplifting,
    even if that lift up hampers your hipness standing to the point where you might
    as well be culturally asleep. Short trips to what was probably an imaginary
    past-- immaculate family gatherings around the tree, perfect junior high
    summers with perfect junior high kisses-- aren't necessarily grounds for an
    inner guilt trip. But depending on your references, be prepared to defend your
    sleepy tastes to anyone who doesn't care for fuzzy focus warmth or the notion
    that fond reminisce amounts to anything more than premature senility. Enter <em>Peanuts</em>.</p><p>
    Best Buy racks full of oldie television DVDs and forgotten cartoons might
    otherwise testify to a healthy market for nostalgia, but Charles Schultz's
    mini-verse-- kids, a dog, unrequited love, and the complete and utter failure
    of the adult world to play a part in any of it-- suggests that the glowing past
    wasn't as warm as we remember. This was the genius of the strip: exposing small
    epiphanies and defeats as the content of real life, even if the lives involved
    were cartoons, and most (but not all) of the readers were too young to care
    about the accuracy of Schulz's observations. Now enter San Francisco pianist Vince Guaraldi.</p><p>
    Playing a smooth brand of West Coast jazz comparable to Dave Brubeck or a <em>very</em>
    snappy Bill Evans, and having scored a modest pop hit with ""Cast Your Fate
    to the Wind"", Guaraldi made an easy choice in 1963 for television producer
    Lee Mendelson as composer for a documentary on Schulz and <em>Peanuts</em>. The
    doc was made, but never aired; apparently, the networks didn't want kids
    hearing any unnecessary ""adult"" thoughts about <em>Peanuts</em>. So
    when plans for <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> came to fruition in 1965,
    Guaraldi's music-- including the classic ""Linus and Lucy"" theme-- got
    its chance. The rest is history: the special has been rebroadcast every year
    since its premier and, though Guaraldi's death of a heart attack in 1976 (in
    between sets at a club no less) prevented him from seeing the full extent of
    his influence on popular culture, it would be hard to name a more recognizable
    cartoon theme, give or take a Danny Elfman piece. 
    </p>
<p>
    But then the reissue of Guaraldi's soundtrack for <em>A Charlie Brown
    Christmas</em> has a lot more going for it than ""Linus and Lucy"".
    Melancholy covers of ""O Tannenbaum"", ""What Child Is This?"",
    ""The Christmas Song"", and ""Hark, the Herald Angels Sing""--
    and yes, it has the <em>Peanuts</em> kids singing ""loo-loo-loo,
    l-loo-loo-loo-loo""-- make for the perfect dysfunctional holiday music.
    Certainly, I will make a point this year to get too drunk, thereby spending the
    week after Christmas listening to this record and regretting telling off my
    grandma. However, it doesn't have to be so bad; Guaraldi's rolling, snow-mystic
    touches on ""What Child Is This?"" or his reconstruction of ""Little
    Drummer Boy"" as the minimalist bossa ""My Little Drum"" are
    hypnotic, faithful mappings of the rhythm of snow falling, or the reflections
    of people walking by store windows. 
    </p>
<p>
    And ""Linus and Lucy"" is here in all its deceptively simple glory.
    In fact, the motive bass line and a perfect realization of the melody are
    patterns that should be taught to all beginning piano students as models of
    efficient finger technique. The closest parallel to this music is Philip
    Glass, and really, ""Linus and Lucy"" is a lot more interesting than
    anything Glass has done in years. Guaraldi's ""Christmas Is Coming"" is
    similarly kinetic, shining with the kind of understated elation you'd expect
    for any music soundtracking the misadventures of kids always ready to celebrate
    while perpetually shown the downside of Christmas. If there's a muted quality
    to a lot of this music, it's smiling nonetheless. 
    </p>
<p>
    The reissue includes alternate takes of several tracks, and great liner
    notes detailing the history of the project. Even the cover is cool, with an
    animation still and foldout, faux LP-style jacket. If all of this screams
    ""stocking stuffer,"" please don't let me stop you. Nostalgic though it
    may be, anything that's as full of introspection, empathy, disappointment,
    loneliness, and the perpetual hope of better things around the corner can't be
    all bad. Like the strip, Guaraldi's songs here are small, observant miracles.

    The basic conceit of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Exodus Into Unheard Rhythms</span><span>, that hip-hop producer Oh No sampled exclusively
    from the catalogue of composer Galt MacDermot, is a clever one. For an artist
    whose audience outbids itself on eBay record auctions, Oh No, aka Mike Jackson
    aka Madlib's little brother, getting permission to raid the archives of a
    jazz/funk cult hero is a big deal and a smart sales strategy-- a sort of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Willy
    Wonka</span><span> for cratediggers. But </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Exodus</span><span> is more than a gimmick, because, as strange as it might sound, Oh No and </span><span>his main source MacDermot</span><span> seem to share a genuine rapport. Oh No
    gracefully layers these compositions the way MacDermont did with his own, fusing inspirations with the same wide-eyed gusto and ending up with the
    same kind of buoyant and elegant songs. The resulting record is a few things: exceptionally cohesive, revelatory, smart as hell, and livelier than any other
    hip-hop record this year.</span></p><p class=""MsoBodyText"">
    That sounds hyperbolic, but it's true: Rap dudes did not have enough fun this year. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Exodus </span><span>is a party on wax (figuratively) about wax (literally). It's a record by record nerds about record nerds for record nerds that invites non-nerds to nerd the fuck out. The enthusiasm and optimism shared by everyone involved (there are 23 participants, by my count) is infectious in a ""We Are the World"" way, minus the narcissism. It's irresistible and kind of inspiring to hear this many artists on the same page, making songs about whatever as long as they're not about how much everything sucks. Everything does suck. We don't necessarily need records to make it worse. </span></p><p class=""MsoBodyText"">
    Most representative of this spirit is ""T. Biggums"", which features Stones Throw cohorts Dudley Perkins as the title character and Georgia Anne Muldrow as his weary mother. Not just a song named after Dave Chappelle's crafty crackhead, ""Biggums"" is his fictional bio. Ostensibly jokey, it's actually an empathetic, hoarsely sung, little tale that personalizes drug addiction and, intentional or not, offers a sly rebuttal to commercial rap's drug trade. Sounds leaden, but Oh No's track is built on a twinkling MacDermot piano melody and mid-tempo shuffle that lift the burden of ""the message,"" giving the song room for a hopeful shrug. That's the thing: the heavier the lyric on <em>Exodus</em>, the more uplifting the instrumental. I've already expressed my love for ""Black"", the fiery return of Poor Righteous Teachers' Wise Intelligent on a ludicrously bouncy track, in the P4k Tracks section, and the criminally underrated Buckshot of Black Moon/Boot Camp Clik on ""Gets Mines"" almost brings tears of nostalgia to my eyes with Galt's pounding piano sample and Buck's perseverant rasp. And I'm beyond objectivity with De La Soul's Posdnuos, who appears on ""Smile a Lil' Bit""; everything that guy's said since ""Potholes In My Lawn"" sounds like something I need to know. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Exodus</span><span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""></span> is not a ""golden age"" revival, though. It's a revival, period. The older dudes aren't on here as a favor; they absolutely kill their respective tracks. And the young(er)bloods-- mostly Stones Throw affiliates or L.A. mainstays-- respond in kind. Murs is hungrier and more fluid than ever on ""In This"", and Aloe Blacc sings like a desperate man on ""Second Chance"". The effort level is set high early and rarely falters, no matter if it's newcomer Roc C or grimy vet A.G. Oh No doesn't sew an elastic waistband into Galt's music for the old heads, and he doesn't bedazzle shit for the youngsters. </span>

    Why would he? At the center of this project is a 78-year-old man who's welcomed producers, Pete Rock and Juju of the Beatnuts into his home to peruse his collection for sample records. MacDermot, the composer behind the musical <em>Hair</em> and scorer of the seminal blaxploitation flick, <em>Cotton Comes to Harlem</em>, had a song covered by Cannonball Adderley and another flipped into a #1 hit for Busta Rhymes. He grew up listening to his musical father's records and studied and internalized the local music when his family moved to South Africa during his college years. Oh No's beginnings are similar. Born into a musical family with an encouraging musician father, he parsed what he liked and developed it. At this rate, he might rival his own brother, Madlib, very soon. So the union of these two artists, from different times and places, who simply love music and made it their lives is, I can't lie, heartening. I realize that's a very rosy and uncool way to look at the world, but <em>Exodus Into Unheard Rhythms</em> just kind of does that to you.

    If LCD Soundsystem's <em>45:33</em> is good Nike-sponsored running music, <em>No
    Heroes</em> is what boot-wearing non-joggers use at a punk-slapped punching bag
    to reach fighting weight. It's pretty amazing to think Converge has been around
    almost as long as some of you have been alive, especially considering this
    sixth full-length is packed with some of the most ferocious
    moments in the Boston quartet's 15-plus year history.</p><p>
    These 14 right hooks are buff motherfuckers, rendered in various shades of blacks
    and blues and reds, but it's the opening tandem that really cooks. Shoving
    feedback and a heavy instrumental build out of the way, neck-tat sporting
    vocalist Jacob Bannon skewers a two-minute sermon on the opening track, ""Heartache"": ""We are all falling
    down/ We are all falling/ Every word that you pray/ Makes another slave/ Every
    idol that you build/ Brings another plague."" When the mathy mid-tempo returns, the song appropriately
    rams bass-first into ""Hellhound"", a one-minute rip-roar of in-the-red
    calisthenics. And then, well, it's gone, replaced by the equally taut
    ""Sacrifice"": ""Hit the lights/ I've had enough/ Guilt to build a
    city/ Shame to fill a sea/ Reasons to give up and lose everything/ Regret to
    burn this body/ Filth to cut these hands/ Reasons to bury this and everything we
    have."" Vengeance? It's only 58 seconds long. Its motto: ""I'm built
    for war.""</p><p>
    The blast radius of those first few pieces is brutal. The rest of the album
    slows down, but refuses to relent. Only doomy centerpiece ""Grim
    Heart/Black Rose"", with its melodic, anguished guest vocals by ex-Only
    Living Witness fellow Jonah Jenkins, offers a chance to catch your breath. The
    track's an epic (over nine minutes), its ending a long fade-out, turning down
    the volume in the room instead of cutting the power. Despite Sabbathian
    overtones, it manages to maintain the crushing equation when Bannon reemerges
    near the album's close: A few raps of the cymbal, heavier bass tones, guitar reps,
    drum hits, adequate build, and then his bloody voice: ""Black rose/ Be my
    light/ In the darkness of nights/ Be my heart."" You couldn't cut the
    tension with a Lifetime record.
    </p>
<p>
    There are Nation of Ulysses call-and-response
    hardcore anthems (""Trophy Scars"", ""Lonewolves"") and lines that could inspire
    Blake Schwarzenbach to emo feats of strength: ""Keep your scars on your
    sleeve/ And your heart in your hands."" Fancy guitars are whittled into
    sharp-edged daggers. Nugget-sized explosions offer violently poetic
    sentiments: ""I'll strike you down/ With rage and rapture."" Eardrums and asses are kicked. 
    </p>
<p>
    When <em>You Fail Me</em> was released two years ago, there was grumbling
    about its post-<em>Jane Doe</em>
    experimentation and misspelled love letters. Some
    sticking points were the ""First Light"" intro and the acoustically
    bent ""In Her Shadow"". Nowadays, instead of overstuffed, that older
    album sounds a<em> </em>bit<em> </em>thin. It's a comparative backward glance: Guitarist Kurt Ballou did an especially
    fine job
    recording <em>No Heroes</em>. It's huge. Musically, as if panning for gold, the band removed
    everything extraneous and came up with something richer. 
    </p>
<p>
    Also surprising: <em>No Heroes</em> is the longer record of the two, even
    with fewer songs. But because the writing's strong, it speeds by. You see what I'm getting at? I'm a big fan of <em>You Fail Me</em>
    and the past work, but I'd venture to say this is the band's most fully realized, which
    (again) is amazing this far into their catalog. Score a victory for old guys with
    bad knees! Conceptually reminiscent of the way Orthrelm's<em> OV</em> rocked socks within a
    tight framework, <em>No Heroes</em> is one of the year's most musically cohesive
    ways to keep pulses beating rapidly.

Our musical tastes are getting more disparate and fragmented as it gets easier to satisfy our musical itches, and we tend to champ bands like, say, Mastodon, who are happy to stand for every enduring trait and endearing excess of their genre (and that's no slight, it's precisely why that band rules), rather than inhale an accompanying subculture whole hog and find the interesting acts that may be hidden in corners.</p><p>
    Giddy Motors are definitely a hidden-corner band-- a dark, filthy, vermin-infested, stuffed-with-scraps-of-nesting hidden corner. Maybe we can blame the four years its been since their last album for their dwindling profile. Their debut, <em>Make It Pop</em>, was a gloriously unpredictable record, combining the gleeful grinding you'd likely find either on the Touch and Go label's roster or recorded by Steve Albini (if not both), with improvisational breaks that had some people shouting free jazz. With their new album, however, they've streamlined those tendencies and begun dredging up the shaved-head-and-short-pants riffing of early 1990s acts like Helmet. If it sounds like an absurd or unwieldy combination, don't be fooled, as <em>Do Easy</em> is even more accessible than the band's debut; it's still bleak and ugly, but nowhere near as surprising as its predecessor. Before they sounded fearless; now they sound like guys you should be afraid of.</p><p>
    But focusing never hurt anyone, and honing their lumbering rhythms into a finer point brings a sleeker, almost industrial sound to the band. There's an airy sample hidden underneath the railroad-chug consistency of the rhythm in ""Sick"", if you strain to hear under the vicious funk of the guitars and disturbed caterwauling. It's apparent that there's plenty of room for virtuosity, melody, and catharsis at the Giddy Motors' table, but where they'd once break to show off their prowess or unpredictability, they only stop to make the song more sick. ""Kapow"" is more relentless pinpoint hammering with manic, onomatopoeic howling from singer Gaverick de Vis and a slippery lockdown groove in the bridge, but ""Panzarama"" is the disc's dynamic highlight, flying on head-bobbing bass and slicing staccato guitar notes. It showcases De Vis'  highly strange delivery, over-enunciating like a bad Dylan impersonator, twisting and rolling his syllables in the recesses of his mouth when not howling the vowels from the back of his throat.
    </p><p>
    ""Early Morning Pipe"" flashes a simpler, sassier fuzz-bass riff with de Vis growling along with the abrupt spurts of guitar, which might have you missing Mclusky for a moment. ""Nego"" uses the same undulating bass and hair-raising guitar, but rolling a little more recklessly and consistently harsh. ""Down With a High Heel"" is a mid-tempo gurgle that manages to surprise, as the guitar grinding unpredictably hits from all sides like a hostile interrogation. Giddy Motors finally stretch their legs and their chops on the instrumental ""End Game"", led by a stark, impressionistic bass drone with a few distant dive bombs of guitar, mostly threatening without delivering on the violence. It's a fine moment to catch a smoke right before the aural punishment of ""Dot Dot Dot"", a mostly silent soundscape that intermittently drops screaming sheets of white noise into the mix. 
    </p>
<p>
    Just one song on <em>Make It Pop</em> might have covered all this ground, but <em>Do Easy</em> is very deliberately plotted and paced. At just over half an hour, it's terrifyingly concise, slowly churning through brawny post-hardcore pigfuck before easing in to back-turned fuck-off insanity, making the transition slow and steady and saying all they really need to say.  The same jazz-influenced diversions are there, but folded imperceptibly into an otherwise accessible grind-- you won't remember the ringing arpeggios of ""Panzarama"" because they're the grease puddle that slides into the disc's most memorable chorus. (That's ""DISEASE!"" Can't miss it.) A statement that concise is the mark of a band with plenty to show but nothing to prove, and it's remarkable that something so tightly focused can remind us how broad the horizon of underground should be.

    Less than 100 years ago, the Parisian police were famously called to the
    premiere of Igor Stravinsky's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Rite of Spring</span><span>. Stravinsky's two-part ballet challenged the audience on nearly every
    level, and its emphasis on intentional dissonance and rhythmic unrest-- not to mention
    its admittedly pagan themes-- drove the crowd to disorder. Almost six decades
    later, Steve Reich's stateside premiere of ""Four
    Organs"" also caused chaos, and later, John Cage said of Glenn Branca's </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Indeterminate
    Activity of Resultant Masses</span><span>: ""If it was
    something political, it would resemble fascism.""<span> </span>Important works, especially in regard to classical
    iconoclasm, come with intense labor pains.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But the
    ideas of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Rite of Spring</span><span>-- as well as
    Reich's phase pieces and Cage's prepared piano pieces-- are now considered passé. Their
    lessons have been absorbed into and applied far beyond the realm of art music,
    from Brian Eno to Ciara. The idée fixe, then, of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Warp Works &amp;
    Twentieth Century Masters</span><span>-- ""to explore the
    connection between electronic experimenters on the Warp label and <span></span>their sonic grandfathers"" by physically
    </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">playing</span><span> pieces once performed by
    machines-- should be easy enough. The basic notion is a given, and the concept
    that Reich's modulation ideas and that Karlheinz Stockhausen's half-century-old
    compositions for ring modulators and synthesizers preceded work by current
    electronic idols is dogma. A dozen box sets, after all, have exhausted this
    topic. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But, on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Warp Works</span><span>,
    the London Sinfonietta reinvents work from Cage, Reich, Aphex Twin, and
    Squarepusher, first imagined for mixed media of man and machine, as pieces
    imaginatively played and performed by flesh-and-bone musicians. Pristine and
    convincing, these recordings, culled from three European performances by the
    Sinfonietta in 2003 and 2004, cast the original pieces in a fresh light.
    Reich's ""Six Marimbas"", played in real-time by six people, is immaculate, and
    the four movements of György Ligeti's </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Chamber Concerto</span><span> are masterfully evocative, poling between whimsy,
    fright, apprehension and doom with rarified clarity. Pianist Clive Williamson
    lends consummate subtlety and precision to the prepared piano pieces of Cage and
    (to a lesser extent) Aphex Twin. An obvious lineage seems, somehow, worth
    revisiting. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But, for all of the Sinfonietta's dexterity, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Warp Works</span><span>' didactism is as incomplete as it is redundant, and
    that's what it suffers the most. The quest for extended instrumental techniques
    and the conquest of emerging technology for making music </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">better</span><span> (or simply different) are both older than recorded
    music, and the selection of pieces that illustrate ties between Stockhausen and
    Squarepusher seems entirely arbitrary, if not coincidental. There are better
    representations from both Aphex Twin and Squarepusher available, and that the
    only two electronic artists here once called Warp home craft a dubious, partial
    lesson. Perhaps it's a lesson that can push back-catalogue sells, but it offers
    very few authentic insights. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    In fact, Squarepusher and Aphex Twin feel like the artists
    that do not belong. Following Conlon Nancarrow's ""Study no. 7"" by four tracks,
    the saturated sounds of Squarepusher's ""The Tide"" fall short of their
    historical precedents. In the liner notes, the pieces are linked because they
    both employed technology to perform music too complex for existing instrumental
    ensembles. Somewhat isolated in Mexico City, Nancarrow realized that finding players
    to handle his intricacies and concepts (ultimately, he composed rhythmic and
    tonal ratios based on the irrational numbers pi and e) would be impossible.

<p>Skip back to 1999, when the band was still in label limbo and appeared on a Drive-Thru records compilation, with the preliminary versions of ""Miss Me"" (which would later become ""Boys, You Won't"") and ""This Boy Is Exhausted"", sounding nothing like that sparse live reimagining nor the wearily triumphant version on <i>The Meadowlands</i>. They weren't quite as formulaic as the rest of Drive-Thru's pop-punk-dominated roster, but just as brazen with their hooks; these songs were primed for radio. Wrens' debut and sophomore record, <i>Silver</i> and <i>Seacaucus</i>, have been out-of-print and hostaged for exorbitant sums by eBay and Amazon sellers for years after a somewhat-infamous, somewhat-acrimonious split from Grass Records, which would become Wind-Up (and home to Evanescence and Creed) following a change of ownership. At the time of the switch, new label president Alan Meltzer asked the band to re-record some of their songs with pop potential (""Bulit-In Girls"" and ""Surprise, Honeycomb"" among them) from <i>Secaucus</i> for re-release and wider consumption-- a session which the band agreed to and dutifully carried out.

<p>But you'd never guess that from only hearing these two records. Call the Wrens eager to please, and maybe leave it at that.

<p>""Propane"" opens the record with a curveball, however-- a simple melody that has big ambitions, several different instruments briefly poking through the mix in a rare moment of understatement. It's what you'd think would introduce a low-fi triumph of a record. <i>Silver</i> is ambitious, certainly, but also extremely haphazard, roughly produced, and even poorly sung in more than a few spots over its 23 (!) tracks. All part of the charm, maybe, if they hadn't blown through every idea they had at lightning speed and given little thought to pacing or structure, as evidenced by disjointed and overreaching tracks like ""Strange as Family"" or ""Me, the Misser, the Late"". Even ignoring the misses, much of the record is marked by one-note quasi-punk like ""Darlin Darlin"", ""Kevin's Hell"", and ""6"", and a few better jagged pop toss-offs like ""Leather Side"" and ""Behold Me"". It can be an arduous listen to get to the gems on this record (though they're  there), but chalk it up to the common and always-impossible mistake for bands to try and capture the energy of a live show on their debut. Getting an either-brilliant-or-uneven Wrens show on record proves an even more complicated issue.</p>
<p>There may be some who take to this early, rough-edged document of the band, though the supposedly clumsy dream-pop concessions now sound as if they predated the mood of <i>The Meadowlands</i>. Ponderous piano track ""William"" clears away the clutter and tugs the heartstrings, and ""Gray Complexion"" is, according to the brief introduction, Jill's favorite song and it's mine too, with a little ""Dream On""-style guitar in the verse sliding into skipping triplets and swaggering desperation from Kevin in the chorus-- it sounds, for a moment, like a band finding its own voice. The same would go for ""What's a Girl"" were it not for crash-landing all its graceful momentum with a strange studio-patter interlude and some carelessly overwrought vocals. The band has no shortage of ideas here, but trying all of them at once bogged down these otherwise fine performances. But when it's on, as in the aforementioned ""Propane"" and in the calmer, less-indebted spots, the patience of their later albums shines through.</p>
<p>But while <i>Silver</i> is a bit better than its low profile, <i>Secaucus</i> is that perfect combination of a band that's discovered when at its hungriest. Scraping away some of that noisy artifice that doesn't date well-- and never fit them besides-- freed the Wrens to write a lean, layered, and near-perfect power-pop record, exemplified by shoulda-been-hits like ""Surprise, HoneyComb"", ""Built-in Girls"", and the lullaby-slash-flirting-manual ""I've Made Enough Friends"". The songs were sharper now, but more than that, it's worth noting that this is the only document of the band where they don't somehow sound hesitant.</p>
<p>Also worth noting that it's here the twin singers come into their own, and despite Kevin's leaps and bounds on highlights like ""Built-in Girls"" and ""Rest Your Head"", he starts to sound like a foil for Charles. Both of them have a newfound lyrical focus here: <i>Secacucus</i> turned small-town alienation inward and outward, from washed-up dreams and unfulfilled potential on the stately ballad ""Won't Get Too Far"", inability for long-term relationships over Beach Boys appropriation in ""Jane Fakes a Hug"", a brief spitting spite to scene copycats with ""Indie 500"", and, as a logical conclusion to all that, killing sprees (""Surprise, Honeycomb"").</p>
<p>It's a stunningly consistent album, especially considering its length (and Jesus, these two are long records).

The record also included softer threads, notably ""Jane Fakes a Hug"" and ""Won't Get Too Far"", the bittersweet beer-swilling ballads that somehow become the centerpieces of all their albums even though their live shows couldn't be more raucous.</p>

    Pete Doherty refuses to be written off. By now, rock's most famous crack addict should be either just another cautionary tale (""kids, this is your Clash cover band on drugs"") or the wasted embodiment of emptily nostalgic hype-mongering (""English journos, raise yr standards!"").  And yet if the ex-Libertine's first Babyshambles outing, 2005's <em>Down in Albion</em>, wasn't quite an embarrassment of scruffy rock riches like the Libs' <em>Up the Bracket</em>, it was, more importantly, <em>not an embarrassment</em>.</p><p>
    Doherty's current band's first Parlophone release, <em>The Blinding EP</em>, looked to be a likely tipping point. First, two of its five songs have already been released, ""The Blinding"" with homeless-sold magazine <em>The Big Issue</em> and ""Beg, Steal or Borrow"" via MySpace for London's Get Loaded in the Park Festival. Meanwhile, Doherty's latest headlines all have a ""last days"" feel: dead actors, modeling gigs, a forthcoming TV cartoon (""A Boy Named Pete"")...Must've been right about this point when M.C. Hammer wished he'd reconsidered buying that mansion.</p><p>
    Aw, hell. Less workmanlike than fellow ex-Lib Carl Barât's debut with Dirty Pretty Things earlier in 2006, <em>The Blinding EP</em> is just as mired in the backward-looking ""rock is back this time, seriously guys"" guitar scuffs of 2000s <em>NME-</em>dom, when these days even the Strokes are <strike>desperately flailing</strike> trying new sounds. No major-label reinventions here. Still, Doherty's tortured charm and sloppy melodies make for a record that could sound great in a particularly dank dive after the proper gallonage of Bud Light. Or, as I call it, ""Diet Coke"".
    </p>
<p>
    ""On with, on with, on with the show"": Doherty's scratchy title track gets innocuous from the get-go, guitars stabbing on the third beat over a loping bass line. Guy's got ""things to be getting on with,"" but this punny transition is the best moment of a song that soon dissolves in stale screams and indecipherable chatter. Finale ""Sedative"" is soft-loud by numbers, Pixies for punters, and every bit the soporific sop its title suggests. His mind on an indeterminate former hero, Doherty howls, ""It's been a long, long time.""
    </p>
<p>
    But not that long. With wheezy harmonica and a harmony-filled bridge, ""Beg, Steal or Borrow"" doesn't get any marks for originality, but its skiffley optimism could provide a template for future Arctic Monkeys singles. Guitar-flanged ""Love You But You're Green"" repurposes ""People Get Ready"" as a witty reminiscence of troubled youth and imaginary girlfriends.
    </p>
<p>
    However, Doherty shows the most lingering promise when he clambers out of Britrock's dull Paddingtons/Kooks sandbox. On ""I Wish"", his happily miserable take on ska, Doherty moans, ""I wish to God that I'd just been stabbed,"" accompanied by chipper horns and bright Jamaican upstrokes. Fingers crossed for a Baby Cham collab. Babyshambles' shambolic frontman reportedly lives life to extremes, but his music too often plays it safe-- an intoxicated echo of past icons from a man still too (moderately) talented to flame out entirely.

As described in a 2003 feature in <em>The Wire</em> by David Toop, Russell spent endless hours up until his death in 1992 reworking his own music in studios or his apartment. And even when something was ""done,"" Russell would just as soon hand it to someone like legendary remixer Walter Gibbons, who'd mess with it all over again. Russell's music-- with often very little holding it to verse-chorus-verse structure to begin with-- was a series of musical elements that simply coexisted in a world of echo, elements to be pushed, prodded, subtracted, repeated, or tweaked beyond recognition.</p><p>
    So fans shouldn't be too worried that Audika had commissioned a DFA remix of Russell's unfinished ""Springfield"" on this new EP, the most recent installment in the label's Russell reissue program. By the time the track was begun in the mid-1980s, Russell's aqueous disco already moved to the electro-funk and proto-house beats that are the DFA's whole reason for existing. Tim Goldsworthy and James Murphy merely construct a funky, bass-y spine for what, on the evidence of the long and winding ""original"" mix and short rough sketch on the EP, was a gorgeous if rather amorphous swirl of Russell's signature buzzing walls of synthesizer, raw-toned cello, and little-boy-lost voice.</p><p>
    If all of Russell's music is watery, ""Springfield"", especially in its original mix, is a jacuzzi, percussion bubbling, as weird as Ricardo Villalobos at his most maximalist and haunted by ghosts of the late 80s, right down to the corroded AOR brass (shades of near-death Miles Davis) and house pianos. As usual, Russell's falsetto and love of smeary reverb means you only hear every other word of what he's singing, but it's more about the <em>way</em> he sighs ""never been kissed."" The DFA are smart enough to blow all the extraneous sounds away around five minutes into their mix to bring Russell's voice right up into your ear. It's as shiver-worthy a moment as 2006 has produced, even if the voice was recorded nearly 20 years ago and its owner is long dead.
    </p><p>
    The rest of <em>Springfield</em> is a testament to Russell's life's-work-as-obsessive-and-endless-self-remix project. ""See My Brother, He's Jumping Out"" is a drum-happy rework of all-time classic ""Let's Go Swimming,"" a swirl of synthesized congas, bongos, and bass drums booming from the ocean floor. This is post-disco as rhythm and nothing but. Like my Villalobos mention above, we wouldn't hear much like its pointillist, psychedelic percussion again until Perlon-style microhouse over two decades later, but of course Russell's fat midrange synths and '80s technology (some of those fills sound like highlife drummers let loose on hexagonal syndrums) mean his sound is thicker than the spiky, spare Germans.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Corn #3"" sounds like a remix of materials (more quavering keyboard tonalities, strings, slow and deliberate beat) from the <em>Calling Out of Context</em> era, though I didn't pull it out to A/B them, so I can't be sure. And ""You Did the Right Thing When You Put That Skylight In"" is a tiny song-sketch with a joke that's all in the title and proof that head-in-the-clouds cosmonaut Russell could be direct and whimsical at the same time. <em>Springfield</em> probably could have done with being beefed up by a few more tracks into something like a proper release, but as it stands, the two mixes of ""Springfield"" and ""See My Brother"" are important new pieces to completing the ever-expanding Russell puzzle.<br/>

    There's a tendency with Jan Jelinek to lean on record titles and release
    notes for clues about the content of his music. As his latest is called <em>Tierbeobachtungen</em>,
    German for ""animal observations,"" some have been hearing an
    ""animal like"" quality in these tracks. And as he's said that he
    recorded these tracks in various locations while between studios, others are
    hearing something restless and displaced.</p><p>
    It's an understandable tendency with projects as abstract and focused on
    pure sound as Jelinek's, to search for a concept around which to orient the
    music. And perhaps there's something to these ideas. But I'm hearing a record
    that continues very much in the vein of last year's <em>Kosmischer Pitch</em>,
    Jelinek's subtle (almost subliminal) homage to Krautrock, with a couple
    of noticeable differences.</p><p>
    Like his last record, <em>Tierbeobachtungen </em>discards the sleek, gleaming
    microsound detail of Jelinek's earlier work for oddly cut loops of creaky old
    instruments like guitar and organ. Whatever the sound sources-- whether the
    instruments were recorded live or sampled-- the grainy distortion of the
    recording is highlighted and the almost imperceptible air of the room is
    preserved. This is warm, loose, fuzzy music; in its unfussiness it's almost the
    exact opposite of the perfectionism Jelinek exhibited when he first came on the
    scene. 
    </p>
<p>
    But where <em>Kosmischer Pitch </em>still made judicious use of beats, <em>Tierbeobachtungen
    </em>drifts untethered, the rhythms created only by the overlapping loops that
    are, for the moment, his sole mode of composition. Though Jelinek is still
    presumably working with software, his music presently bears a sharp
    resemblance to that of turntable artist Philip Jeck, minus the disembodied
    voices the latter usually cycles into his loops. Both the duration and quality
    of Jelinek's base segments have the sense of skipping vinyl. Most tracks
    consist of a half-dozen or so fragments ranging from a couple seconds to almost
    10, which are set in motion, played off of each other, and tweaked in the mix. 
    </p>
<p>
    The effect is both static and oddly propulsive, with swells of sound shoving
    the tracks toward something even as everything seems to be simultaneously
    spinning in place. The tension between movement and stasis is the most enticing
    thing about <em>Tierbeobachtungen</em>, creating a sort of woozy, disorienting
    headspace that winds up being psychedelic and more than a little heavy, despite
    the absence of extreme dynamic range or noise. The music is hypnotic and
    meditative but also quietly unsettling and sometimes even a little creepy. 
    </p>
<p>
    At this point Jelinek's preference for widely variable ""head""
    music-- even in his dance work, people talked more about texture than swing--
    may well be his defining characteristic. He's not interested in drama, narrative
    arc, specific emotional states, or music scenes; Jelinek, more than just about
    anyone going, is exploring sound as an end in itself, the way a painter might
    explore the line or a filmmaker, light. Farben, his house alias, is
    the German word for ""colors,"" after all. That he chose this specific

    For the last decade, the Melvins have absolutely shat
    on their seminal status. Their antics have ranged from gimmicky (releasing a
    single for every month in 1996) to kitschy (kicking off 1999's <em>Crybaby</em>
    with Leif Garrett belting out a cover of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"")
    to just plain wimpy (2005's limp-wristed live recording of <em>Houdini</em> in
    its entirety). Due to these bloopers, there was much head-shaking and sighing
    to be had when the band, now reduced to a putative duo consisting of King Buzzo
    and drummer Dale Crover, announced their merger with L.A. drums/bass metal band
    Big Business earlier this year. That's right, as if the band's recent
    tomfoolery hadn't marred their first proper release in four years, they now
    sport two drummers, the pinnacle of rock absurdity.</p><p>
    What a pleasant surprise then that<em> (A) Senile Animal</em>
    stands as the band's most no-frills, accessible, and flat-out best album since <em>Stoner
    Witch</em>. <em>Hostile Ambient Takeover</em> from 2002 didn't testify to it, but
    you can find the Melvins's legendary sound speckled all over today's metal
    bands. <em>Animal</em> reclaims the stoner rock the Melvins ruled before Kyuss
    and Queens of the Stone age co-opted it, and Boris owes much of their recent
    hipster metal success (not to mention moniker) to the band's early sound,
    reincarnated here on tracks like ""Rat-Faced"" and ""You've Never
    Been Right"".</p><p>
    That said, <em>Animal</em> is less a blast from the past
    than a retooling of the Melvins' strongest albums following a more conservative
    mindset. The opening of ""Civilized Worm"" doffs its cap to catchy 70s
    arena rock, pounding out the chords to Cheap Trick's ""Need Your Love""
    over a bare bones blues beat straight off of <em>Machine Head</em>. ""A
    History of Drunks"" follows suit, propping up King Buzzo's singsong melody
    with multi-tracked vocals and a middle section replete with handclaps and a
    surprisingly tender new wave guitar line.
    </p>
<p>
    These nuanced exceptions aside, the Melvins churn out
    their signature straightforward metal sludge by the barrelful on <em>Animal</em>,
    and no one's complaining about that. Three six-plus minute tracks grind the
    album to a close, each harkening back to classic slow burners like ""Night
    Goat"" and ""Hag Me"". Even the twin assault on drums comes
    together nicely as Crover and Big Business mercenary Coady Willis place their
    intersecting fills at loggerheads for our amusement on ""A History of Bad
    Men"". For all their recent boners and elbow-rubbing with Ipecac's
    weirdest, this newfangled Melvins outfit has sobered up to concoct a
    return-to-roots album, one that simultaneously cements their monolithic mark on
    metal while promising there's more gas left in the tank to keep on thrashin'.

It requires songs interesting enough to be worth hearing, yet not so interesting that you wonder why they were ever discarded. It's even trickier with a group like Sonic Youth, who've created so many outlets for their unofficial adventures-- solo records, collaborations, the self-released SYR series-- that a disc of leftovers seems redundant. Maybe that's why the band went 25 years without releasing one.</p><p>
    Despite that inexperience,<em> The Destroyed Room</em> plays the role of non-album well. Each track offers something worthwhile, yet none raises any question as to why it ended up here. That's no surprise, as these four have always judged their own material smartly. Most of their spirited also-rans-- from early toss-offs like the grimy ""You Pose You Lose"" and the pseudo-rap ""Master Dik"" to loose covers of Mudhoney's ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" and the New York Dolls' ""Personality Crisis""-- have worked best as a stand-alone novelties.</p><p>
    What is surprising is the record's variety. The phrase ""Sonic Youth outtake"" immediately conjures an instrumental jam-- a nascent idea that might eventually hatch a full song, like the sketches on SYR2 that became tracks on <em>A Thousand Leaves</em>. About half of this album falls into that category, but there are also squiggly electronics, low-key folk, and rough blues-- styles that have rarely emerged on previous SY-related releases. </p><p>
    The best of these anomalies is ""Blink"", a slow séance that initially sounds like a campfire version of <em>EVOL</em>'s ""Shadow of a Doubt"". But repeated listens reveal something unique, as Kim Gordon's sleepwalking intonations (""I can see/ My body move/ It goes without me"") float through looping hand drums, rubbery bass, and spikes of guitar. Such stoic restraint might have trouble fitting on a proper Sonic Youth album, but it's compelling as an isolated experiment.</p><p>
    Nearly as interesting are two electronic-based pieces. ""Campfire"", a 1999 piece spontaneously composed on a Groovebox sampler, builds a static field of radio waves and synth washes, like an Excepter backing track waiting for John Fell Ryan to drool over it. ""Loop Cat"" comes from the <em>Murray Street</em> days, when the notoriously sleep-averse Jim O'Rourke would often toy endlessly with raw recordings. Here, he molds sparse guitar lines into whirring ambience and springy reverb, morphing the band's basic elements into inverse shapes.</p><p>
<em>The Destroyed Room</em>'s more conventional jams are a mixed bag. The opening 10-minute ""Fire Engine Dream"" outlasts its own inspiration, and the scrawny ""Fauxhemians"" never quite catches fire, but the rest are intriguing essays. ""Kim's Chords"", a bonus cut from the Japanese edition of <em>Sonic Nurse</em>, updates the throb of one of <em>NYC Ghosts and Flowers</em>' best tracks, ""Never Mind (What Was It Anyway)"". Later, ""Beautiful Plateau"" and ""Queen Anne Chair"" offer the kind of rising structures and dreamy guitar noise that remind you that without Sonic Youth, inspired feedback wranglers from My Bloody Valentine to Fennesz might still be seeking influences.</p><p>
    Only once does the most predictable kind of outtake-- the alternate version of an album track-- emerge here, in a 26-minute expansion of ""The Diamond Sea"" from <em>Washing Machine</em>. Like a soft-rock version of <em>EVOL'</em>s ""Xpressway to Yr Skull"", it takes a simple melody and appends long trails of noise and reverb. This might have worked better on the album it was crafted for, adding fire to what felt tepid as an edited single. Maybe one day we'll get a deluxe <em>Washing Machine</em> that includes this superior rendering, but until then, count it as another worthy curiosity on a collection of welcome orphans.</p></div>"|9712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9712-the-destroyed-room-b-sides-and-rarities/|7.2|Marc Masters

I don't do shows; I do seminars. I really talk to people."" That's an awfully specious claim for someone who'd just become famous for making a rap album almost entirely about selling drugs. But Jeezy pushes that Tony Robbins thing hard. That first album was called <em>Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101</em>; this new one is called <em>The Inspiration</em>. And I'm not entirely certain how to explain this, but when I hear a multitracked mob of Jeezys screaming ""now I command you niggas to get money"" over producer Shawty Redd's monolithic haunted-house organs on album opener ""Hypnotize"", I want to go ask my boss for a raise. Jeezy's self-actualization rhetoric might be blunt and artless and questionable-- especially since half the time he's talking about self-actualization through sales of addictive substances-- but it's also remarkably effective.</p><p>
    Jeezy's aesthetics aren't really rap aesthetics, at least not in the classic sense. He doesn't put a lot of stock in wordplay or punchlines or vividly rendered streetscapes. He never switches his flow up from the slow, guttural lurch that made him famous. He doubles his voice up so he sounds like an army, layering his vocals with swarms of drawn out ad-lib exhortations. He has a signature sound, and it comes from Shawty Redd, with whom he has an intuitive chemistry: foghorn synths, churning strings, enormous drums, everything swirling up into an epic gothic heave. All of the producers on <em>The Inspiration</em> adapt their styles to fit Redd's template. The J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League and Don Cannon and Anthony Dent all draw on East-Coast retro-soul sweep for their tracks, but they slow everything up into a massive, nauseous swell. Atlanta go-to bounce guy Mr. Collipark, normally way friskier, dampens his drums into a windswept stomp on ""Wha You Talkin About"". Most spectacularly, Timbaland builds on Jeezy's horror-movie blueprint and suffuses it with his own twittery, spacey weirdness on the dazzling ""A.M."".</p><p>
    And consider this: ""That yayo shit? That's irrelevant/ You can't hide the fact that I'm intelligent,"" Jeezy moans on ""Hypnotize"". Of course, one track later he's talking about how he's ""on the block all day with the blocks all day."" Jeezy has ridden tired crack-rap clichés so hard that he's willfully, literally turned himself into a cartoon character: The angry snowman glaring out from hundreds of thousands of T-shirts last summer. Plenty of rappers are lyrically pushing coke these days, and Jeezy can't compete with ultra-vivid sneer-merchants like Cam'ron and Clipse. When Jeezy resorts to standard hustler wordplay, the results are almost unbelievably lame: ""Heartless, I might need to see the wizard/ Until then, I'ma make the snow a blizzard."" Jeezy's been pushing these same lines since he first emerged, and they sound emptier every time he trots them out.
    </p><p>
    But throughout <em>The Inspiration</em>, Jeezy shows a muddled desire to transcend the clichés he helped create, to create further complexity without ever resolving it. ""Dreamin'"" finds him in confessional mode remembering bad deeds over pretty soul strings and nauseous synth-gurgles from the Runners: ""Mom's smoking rocks, same shit I'm selling/ So who's wrong, her or me?/ She addicted to the high, I'm addicted to the cash/ Almost put my hands on her when I caught her in my stash."" The story has a happy ending: ""I know it's hard, but we made it, baby/ Ten years clean, so she still my lady."" But even with that last line, it's still an awfully bleak story, and I have to wonder if she'd still be his lady even if she wasn't clean or whether time can really heal the wounds of the son's profession being so closely linked with the mother's disease. 
    </p>
<p>
    On ""Bury Me a G"", Jeezy imagines himself murdered and manages to make it sound glamorous: ""Which one of you shot me? Which one of you bastards?/ Bet my nigga King throw a hundred grand in my casket."" Jeezy sounds like he's long accepted an early death as inevitability, like he's learned to live with it. In Jeezy's inspirational talk, bravura and fatalism are inextricably intertwined, and insights come almost despite themselves: ""We live life on the edge like it's no tomorrow/ We grind hard like it's no today/ And do the same shit like it's yesterday/ The game never stops, so who's next to play?"" There's wisdom in his ignorance and ignorance in his wisdom.

The genre now receives what must be one of its definitive texts with <em>The Tragic Treasury</em>, comprising the 13 songs (plus two bonus tracks) Magnetic Fields leader Stephin Merritt composed for the audiobook versions of the <em>Unfortunate Events</em> tridecology.</p><p>
    It's only appropriate that Merritt should wind up here: After all, <em>69 Love Songs</em> inadvertently inaugurated the era of high-concept indie pop. Back in 1999, releasing a 3xCD thematic boxset seemed a smartly audacious way for a relative unknown to grab a few headlines. But these days barely a week passes without some aspiring auteur announcing plans for a 27-album project charting the history of Quebecois separatism, a tricksy song-suite inspired by the novellas of Gérard de Nerval, or a cute new troupe of indie Morris Dancers who live together in a commune on the Isle of Man.</p><p>
    What's surprising is that <em>The Tragic Treasury</em> turns out to be the most consistently enjoyable record Merritt has released this century. Maybe it's a side effect of signing to Nonesuch, but, since <em>69LS</em>, Merritt has become oddly, worthily wholesome: the proudly hand-played, low-key <em>i</em>, the Lincoln Center adaptations of Chinese operas, the appearance alongside Laurie Anderson and Brian Eno on a biblical art project-- at times, he seemed determined to become a one-man PBS. Happily, <em>The Treasury</em> marks the return of the Merritt many of us first fell for: The misanthropic wraith of the old Algonquin who liked ""experimental music and bubblegum and nothing in between"" and wrote songs with titles like ""The Abandoned Castle of My Soul"".
    </p><p>
    Emily Dickinson (who, I believe, sang back-up for the Archies on their Civil War tour entertaining the troops) wrote, ""I like a look of agony, because I know it's true,"" and the songs here proceed from this basic principle. At times perky, funny, lustful, or even philosophical, they are ultimately all drawn from the same bitter well of authentic despair. As such, they transcend the parent series, which, for all the chicly bleak namedrops and second-hand Gore, was ultimately cute. Merritt has a finer sense of Gorey: the understated suggestion in the lines ""There's a hook-handed person/ And others with nastier parts"" from the opening ""Scream and Run Away"", for example; or this simple couplet: ""In the reptile room there's an evil man/ In a strange costume; do not ride in his van"".
    </p>
<p>
    Indeed, a couple of songs here rival ""Gloomy Sunday"" (the 1930 Hungarian ""suicide song"", banned until recently from British airwaves) for sublime dejection, and their presence on what's ostensibly a children's record is really quite subversive. Who would feel entirely comfortable sending their kids to bed with a song like ""Smile! No Once Cares How You Feel"", which notes that ""everyone you despise will die"" and quite blithely suggests that since nothing is true, everything is permitted? Or ""Nothing Is What It Seems"" -- a gorgeous lullaby which in its own lugubrious way is a sweeter, more seductive companion piece to Richard Thompson's searing ""The End of the Rainbow""?
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, jauntier though no less morbid numbers like ""Freakshow"" (""Real people look on you/ Like something unpleasant for the garbage crew to do/ Real people question how/Someone took a lobster's face and/ Put it on a cow"") suggest that it was Merritt who should have got the gig of turning Miss Lonelyhearts into a musical. Strangely enough, Merritt sounds like he's having more fun than he has done in years. And after several albums of being subjected to his ukulele, it's also a pleasure to hear the return of Merritt's emphysemic synth orchestra, burbling away on ""In the Reptile Room"" or ""The World is a Very Scary Place"".
    </p>
<p>
    Profoundly fun as it is, <em>The Tragic Treasury</em> begs questions about Stephin Merritt's future. He's stated that he agreed to work on the Chinese operas and the Hans Christian Anderson project (with their release earlier this year, <em>TTT</em> is, remarkably, his fourth album of the year) because it seemed good experience on his way to fulfilling his ambition of ""writing 100 Hollywood musicals."" But the lesson of his recent albums seems to be that he's truly happiest singing songs of elegant despair. Now, a Cole Porter or a Larry Hart may have been Merritt's equal in terms of misanthropic wit, but they also managed to write songs that became standards across the emotional range, songs that everyone wanted to sing. It remains to be seen if Merritt has the negative capability to write convincingly for people outside of his own bleak sensibility. But until he does, he's guaranteed the number one song in Purgatory.<br/>

    Polysics review written in the last five years, you'd think Japan was
    holding the ultimate doomsday device in some sort of retro-rock arms
    race. While on the whole American indie audiences usually gloss over
    Tokyo's finest new wave spaz act, the critical response reads frenetic,
    with epithets like ""loudest album of the year"" or ""ADHD geeks on
    steroids"" tossed around in anticipation of a Polysics U.S. takeover.
    Obviously, this Japanese invasion hasn't materialized, and<em> Now Is the Time!</em>, despite its hopeful title, reflects this stagnation as the band's least progressive and least risk-taking release to date.</p><p>
    Polysics
    never met the accepted standard for today's hipster ""cool,"" but their
    previous efforts at least contained residual elements of endearing 1990s
    spaz and surf rock bands like Brainiac, Girls Against Boys, and Man Or
    Astro-Man? <em>Time!</em> relegates those elements to a more marginal ad
    hoc role, instead focusing on more by-the-book new wave pop. Don't get
    me wrong, these numbers twitch and jerk in accordance to the band's
    cultish devotion to Devo, but the spasms come more predictably now.
    ""Tei! Tei! Tei!"" feels way too straightforward vis-a-vis previous
    Polysics album openers. While ""Go Ahead Now!"" and ""Bugga Techinica""
    romped ominously through skewed power chords and unstable synth lines,
    ""Tei!"" sounds overly eager to establish a conventional verse/chorus
    structure, kicking off the album on unusually even-keel footing for the
    band.</p><p>
    In lieu of cataclysmic rawk-outs, the band does stitch
    together some subtle yet catchy post-punk ditties, harkening back to
    XTC almost as much as their go-to touchstone Devo. ""I My Me Mine"" and
    ""Walky Talky"" percolate in the same cauldron <em>Drums and Wires</em>
    warmed up in the late 70s, modernizing the sound with mounds of synth
    and sound effects. On the pop front, keyboardist/vocalist Kayo
    contributes her most saccharine new wave gems yet, recalling
    reggae-induced Blondie on ""Wild One"" and unabashedly copping Toni Basil
    sing-song on the oh-so-gooey ""Baby Bias"".
    </p><p>
    Excepting these instances, most of <em>Time!</em>
    rockets through the same cyclical beats and back-and-forth riffs,
    smooshing together several tracks at a time into a heaping blob of new
    wave jitters. As a band equally willing to tap the Mario Brothers Theme
    as <em>Remain in Light</em>, Polysics sound fun because they typically
    take the risks most American and British-bred retro painstakingly
    avoid. Unfortunately <em>Time!</em> forgets this, pulling back way too
    many punches. Sure, the time-tested formula delivers as expected, but
    ultimately the rote freakout leaves you wishing the band could bring
    the hammer down like it used to.

    Adjunct to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City is the Whitney at Altria, a cavernous space located in the floor-level lobby of the Altria Group, Inc., a parent company of both Phillip Morris and Kraft Foods.  The building sits directly across from Grand Central Station, and two of the lobby's four walls are entirely made of glass so that, as audiences watch film screenings and performances, commuters emerging into the city watch them, and vice versa. I was there a few weeks ago to watch Mick Barr perform as his alter-ego Ocrilim (his other, more prominent outfit, is Orthrelm, a guitar and drums duo), whose newest release is <em>Anoint</em>.  Sharing the bill with Barr in this particular screening series were works by Dan Graham, Bruce Nauman, Jim O'Rourke, and Steven Prina, among others; all figures who exist, to varying extremes, in the murky territory carved out by those who work as both artists and musicians.</p><p>
    Barr to my knowledge has never made anything but music, nor has he ever deliberately written music for a museum, installation, or other explicitly ""art"" purpose.  This has not prevented fans and reviewers alike from considering him in traditions of minimalist painting and sculpture (as Dominique Leone did here last year); classical music and modernist musical minimalism (as Joe Gross did, in 2002, in <em>The</em> <em>Village Voice</em>); and in his most natural home, in the pop-music avant-garde (as Andy Beta did, in a recent <em>City Pages</em> review, implicitly comparing Barr's work to that of Lou Reed).</p><p>
    What all this gets at is the fact that Barr's work doesn't fit in anywhere easily.  Listening to <em>Anoint</em>, I spot traces of it in places as diverse as an Alex Ross description of Shostakovich (the composer's ""inclination toward grandiosity and brutality, his perverse manipulations of form, his habit of freezing harmonic movement while a seemingly trivial motif repeats maniacally""), the cartoon horror-soundtrack metal of Relapse two-piece Zombi, and on a couple different subway platforms.  But lets not glamorize Barr either. Ocrilim sounds like a man playing flurries of single notes on a lonesome guitar.  It is technically stunning, compositionally deep, and the sum of its parts.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Anoint</em>, though divided on CD into seven distinct tracks, is a singular long composition.  It begins without ceremony, incoherently; Barr plays a seemingly unrelated steady stream of high-pitched notes, maybe only one step up from a warm-up or the prelude to an improvisation.  Then, a minute in, the playing locks up, and the piece truly begins: repetitive phrase after repetitive phrase, the particulars varying and then disintegrating into the next.  Those familiar with Barr's work will know how quickly his ideas come and go: Orthrelm's <em>Asristir Veildrioxe</em> contained 99 discrete tracks in less than 15 minutes, and an earlier Octis (another Barr alias) work, <em>Uppragn Srilimia Ixioor Ocrilm Nollfithes Mrithixyl</em>, had an only slight more modest 72.  As with those, <em>Anoint</em> requires dozens of listens just to begin untangling its structure.  
    </p>
<p>
    Less riffs than a continuous stream of sound modulated by Barr's blurring fretwork, <em>Anoint</em> hovers around a mildly ominous theme, a sort of insistent declaration of arrival or impending doom or a merely a simple celebration of the way these particular notes join together.  Individuated riffs come but quickly go, and the overall pattern is so large that it is impossible to step far enough away to completely comprehend.  My touchstone for the record,<em> </em>then, came to be architecture.  The piece is like an enormous building; the various passages and intricacies of the various movements within explorations of the monolith's layout and passages.  Barr is making work in three dimensions.
    </p>
<p>
    Ocrilim are taxing, exhausting, and confounding-tributes to its power.  Fatigue demands only so many listens before taking a long break.  It will not be something I return to often, but that will be out of respect.

The San Diego act emerged from the Southern California     hardcore scene nine years ago, and has established an entirely indifferent     reputation for exactly three things: lineage (GoGoGo Airheart, Crimson Curse,     the Locust), family tree (co-founder Jimmy LaValle quit in 2003 to devote time     to his more renowned Album Leaf project), and a trance-conducive mix of rock complexity     and downtempo rhythms and tones.

It</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span><span>represents     another linear progression, too: Most of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">A Colores</span><span>' nine tracks were among the band's most insipid, and during the first eight cuts on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Desafío</span><span>-- together, clocking in at under 19 minutes-- you can practically hear this band falling apart. Each track is a collaboration between four or less     of the group's seven members, with each piece only held together by member     James Lehner and an insistence on static rhythms that plink through gauzy Neu!     textures and light-noise sonics. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The problem begins with the opening ""Común"", which initially sounds like one of the band's more aggressive climbs. But complete     rhythmic stasis lets the tide collapse on itself-- and just when things start to     peak, they fizzle into an underwhelming fade. Larsen does this stuff with more     compelling sounds, and other bands, such as Tortoise, have <span>done it with     more intriguing motifs.</span><span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Desafío</span><span> is replete     with postulates but depleted of beliefs, the work of a band whose ideas and     inclinations still haven't come to grips with the technological tools and     technical wherewithal for capturing them. Nearly every Tristeza album-- from     their best work on 2000's </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Dream Signals in Full Circles </span><span>until their previous nadir on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">A Colores</span><span>-- has felt that way, but the complacence here is     especially flagrant. The accompanying DVD-- 11 evidentiary, undeveloped vignettes     (and the nine-minute, repeated closer) set to inchoate video     manipulation-- doesn't help. The Spanish countryside takes on saturated color     when buried beneath a run-of-the-mill ""paint"" effect on one short, and film of     Pacific Northwestern woods takes on psychotropic, neon tendencies when Luis     Hermosillo applies an effect that iDVD would aptly call ""groovy."" It's the kind     of stuff erstwhile hippy parents on a train tour of Europe would e-mail their     children back home just to prove they were, indeed, using the MacBook and     digital video camera they got for Christmas.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But, both in the audio and visual realms, Tristeza do find     something promising when shunning their newfound love of the miniature: Though     the title track-- a collaboration between Lehner, Hermosillo and Christopher     Sprague-- is as largely uninspiring as its neighbors tonally, its cohesive,     distended workmanship and ideas on horizontal modulation offer some intrigue.     Two drum sequences nest in and out of one another, providing a wobbly but     fecund foundation. The band's textures-- at last-- do more than idle.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Perhaps it's that track's inclusion as the conclusion of     both discs that suggests a more promising next for Tristeza. Then again, as     it's one positively notable piece out of nearly two dozen failures, it could as     easily mean that Tristeza have spun out of their formerly satisfying full circles.</p></div>"|9679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9679-en-nuestro-desafio/|3.3|Grayson Currin

    In 1996, after three decades of acoustic guitar innovation, John Fahey was
    in a rut, going on six years without a new release. Then, in a surprising turn, his
    career was revived by attention from the experimental rock underground. Jim
    O'Rourke, Glenn Jones, David Grubbs, Thurston Moore, and others championed
    Fahey to an audience mostly born after his 1960s heyday. It was a fortuitous development not only because it rekindled interest in Fahey's catalogue, but because his own
    interest in experimental music happened to be on the upswing again at that moment. Disciples like
    O'Rourke and Jones were the perfect catalysts to nudge him toward further exploring
    that side of his work.</p><p>
    The result was a string of albums that explored ambience, collage, and drone while also incorporating Fahey's signature guitar playing. The best is 1997's <em>Womblife</em>,
    which leads off this two-disc compilation of the three albums he released on
    Atlanta label Table of the Elements. Together, these records offer a
    fascinating snapshot of this point in his career. In retrospect, Fahey was at a
    crossroads here between the far edges of sound-art that he was drifting towards and the
    fingerpicking tradition he would revisit in the final years of his life.</p><p>
    After performing at Table of the Elements' Yttrium festival in Chicago in
    November of 1996, Fahey spent a week recording <em>Womblife</em> in O'Rourke's
    bedroom. O'Rourke was on a roll as a producer and collaborator, having
    fashioned the intriguing Faust collage <em>Rien</em> the year before, and his
    influence here is clear. As he and Kevin Drumm (his roommate at the time) added
    touches of dissonance and rumbling backgrounds, Fahey crafted haunting pieces
    more concerned with atmosphere than structure, unleashing clouds of tones that
    echo, overlap, and reproduce. 
    </p>
<p>
    On ""Sharks"", Fahey treads through deliberate chords that melt into
    cavernous sonics, reverberating like the metallic drone of O'Rourke's own
    hurdy-gurdy piece <em>Happy Days</em>. ""Eels"" places similarly cautious
    strums inside an even darker sonic envelope, while ""Planaria"" juxtaposes
    Fahey's most plaintive playing with looped recordings of Balinese gamelan
    music. As the chiming repetitions intertwine with Fahey's uniquely warped slide
    work, an unlikely midpoint between Steve Reich's phase minimalism and Charley
    Patton's backwoods blues is struck.  
    </p>
<p>
<em>Womblife</em> concludes with the simple, beautiful ""Juana"", a
    piece that re-emerged in 1998 on <em>Georgia Stomps, Atlanta Struts, and Other
    Contemporary Dance Favorites</em>, included here on the second disc. Recorded in
    Atlanta in August of 1997, it's Fahey's first and only live electric guitar
    album. His flow is mind-bending as he weaves improvisation, curved takes on
    classics like Artie Shaw's ""Nightmare"" and Duke Ellington's
    ""Mood Indigo"", and sly interpretations of his own pieces into one
    restless guitar marathon. 
    </p>
<p>
    There's no denying Fahey's creative prowess here, but his impulsive
    discourse is impeded a bit by the shrill tone of his borrowed guitar. As Fahey
    scholar Byron Coley put it in a <em>Perfect Sound Forever</em> essay, ""Friends of
    mine have reported being physically sickened by the depth of electric effects
    that Fahey utilizes."" Indeed, at least one track, ""Song for
    Sara"", requires reams of patience due to its high, piercing tones-- but
    brace yourself through multiple listens and you might find that the album's severity fades. 
    </p>
<p>
    Appended after <em>Womblife</em> on disc one is <em>Hard Time Empty Bottle
    Blues</em>, a 10-minute set of acoustic guitar taken from the Chicago
    festival performance that preceded Fahey's sessions with O'Rourke. Previously
    released in 2003 as a one-sided clear-vinyl 12-inch, the record is a bit of an
    afterthought compared to the other material here. But in its own small way,
    it's perfect, filled with the kind of labyrinthine figures, ringing tones, and
    deft shifts that mark Fahey's best work. It's this precise fingerpicking sound
    that he would soon return to, just before his passing in 2001.  
    </p>
<p>
    The nimble playing on those four tracks makes the excursions on <em>Womblife</em>
    even more impressive. David Fricke's liner notes suggest that Fahey had lost
    some of his playing ability by this point, and perhaps that was true, but <em>Hard
    Time Empty Bottle Blues</em> shows he could still tear off dazzling runs that
    most mortals would envy, suggesting that<em> Womblife</em>'s experiments were less
    inventions of necessity than bold creative choices. Fahey refused to abandon
    his fickle muse even this late in life, making <em>Sea Changes and Coelacanths</em>
    a vital curve in the winding path left by his staggering oeuvre.

    It's strange to think about nowadays, but ""MTV Unplugged"" used to be damn near a cultural event-- maybe the last U.S. television concert series to seem more valuable than an infomercial.  The concept almost sounds ridiculous in retrospect, but during the rise of grunge and the genesis of hip-hop's radio dominance, the loosely-enforced acoustic laws seemed like a formidable challenge to artists used to sleepwalking through hollow talk-show appearances.  Sure, the whole ""authenticity"" angle was conservative-minded crap, but for the few that truly bought into the concept, this restriction spurred creativity, forcing bands to give a unique performance rather than the same old replication of their latest record and greatest hits.</p><p>
    One of the most famous ""Unplugged"" episodes, of course, was Nirvana's 1993 set-- and not just because Kurt Cobain died six months later.  Nirvana showed a willingness to embrace the show's formula, covering David Bowie and Vaselines songs, giving spirited performances of deep cuts, and inviting the Meat Puppets on stage just because they could.  As a result, their ""Unplugged"" set was an exceptional case where novel things were learned about the featured band: Cobain was proven to be a much better singer than anyone suspected, the band turned out to have subtle nuances hidden beneath their waves of distortion, and prospective (sadly unrealized) fruitful directions were suggested for their music.</p><p>
    Though Dave Grohl brought it on himself by releasing this acoustic live album, <em>Skin and Bones</em>, I'll admit to feeling somewhat guilty about mentioning the N-word in a Foo Fighters review. Particularly for a younger generation, it's no longer Grohl's primary claim to fame, as he's spent the past 12 years leading the Foos through a very successful run of records, indulging his metal sensibilities with side project Probot, and graciously playing the part of unfeatured session man on albums for Queens of the Stone Age and Cat Power.  Most notably, the Foo Fighters have long since shed their spinoff-band origins, becoming, rather appropriately, perhaps the archetypal band for post-Nirvana alt-rock, crafting single after single of anthemic pop-rock with a soft spot for arena bombast, but tempered by a self-deprecating sense of humor.
    </p>
<p>
    That status has earned the band the right to indulge in some rockstar excess of late, first with last year's electric/acoustic double album <em>In Your Honor</em>, and now with tour document <em>Skin and Bones</em>.  But rather than revealing any subtleties within the Foo Fighters' sound, <em>Skin and Bones</em> exposes limitations in Grohl's songwriting and vocals, and spends most of its 73 minutes reinforcing their one-dimensionality.
    </p>
<p>
    The fact that the band follows the ""intimate"" gameplan only half-heartedly, ballooning out to eight members and going electric at will, betrays the fact that they're most comfortable and best-heard at full volume.  Stabs at grim seriousness like ""Razor"" and ""Friend of a Friend"" spin their wheels during meandering verses which spotlight Grohl's easy rhymes and lazy riffs, while heavy-mass songs like ""Everlong"" and ""My Hero"" sound wounded by the lack of amplification.  Grohl's voice repeatedly wilts under the extra scrutiny, either clunkily screaming for emphasis or under-pronouncing words for dramatic effect.
    </p>
<p>
    A couple of songs do benefit from the expanded lineup; for instance, the inevitable Petra Haden appearance lends a rich violin to dusty Nirvana rarity ""Marigold"", and ""Next Year"" is the one mega-hit to be given a decent rearrangement, courtesy of some mean accordion work.  But these brief respites can't hide that most of these interchangeable dorm-room chord progressions and broad-appeal lyrics sound a pride-swallow away from the much-dreaded ""This Is Our Country"", thanks to the unfortunate side effects of the acoustic guitar and Dylan-organ emphasis.  By deflating their sound so severely, <em>Skin and Bones</em> inadvertently reminds us of the more cynical sides of why ""MTV Unplugged"" was such compelling television: its vanity-mirror ability to magnify and illuminate a band's hidden flaws.

    Multi-artist soundtrack discs often sound
    disjointed, uncomfortably arranging disparate tracks to milk a few more bucks from a box-office sensation. This one, though, is
    remarkable for its unity, bringing together a handful of unrelated artists to form a bigger picture in much the same way that Eric Schlosser's
    widely-read exposé of the fast food industry stitched together
    anecdotes with hard data. Of course, it's a soundtrack to the fictional movie, not the
    factual book, but the film does basically the same thing as the book, just in
    a dramatic setting.</p><p>
    The primary fabric of the disc is the desert melancholia of
    Friends of Dean Martinez. Their moody, desolate twang is so well-suited to soundtrack work that it's surprising it's taken so long for a major filmmaker
    to employ them in such a capacity. As a longtime fan, I can only hope this
    kind of exposure garners the band more attention than their string of excellent
    albums. Their work on this disc is a little more ambient than usual, as one
    might expect, but ""Somewhere Over the Waves"" and the re-recording of their old
    chestnut ""A Place
    in the Sun"" remain consumingly chilly pieces that
    nonetheless manage to breathe like living creatures.</p><p>
    The disc kicks off with something of a fake-out: ""Mickey's Big One"" is an uncharacteristically strident track for the band, a blob of goopy funk about as
    greasy as the slop that gets passed through drive-thru windows. But elsewhere, the
    songs showcase the Friends' usual Latin tinge, and much of the other artists' material shares that Southwestern quality. Nortec Collective's ""Don
    Loope"" is the most obvious, and one of the best, with its big beat and mangled
    mariachi horns attacked by screaming Cuban jazz trumpet. It jumps
    through several entertaining movements packed with borderland signifiers, shifting
    rhythms, and wobbly melodies.
    </p>
<p>
    Park the Van Records has indulged a bit by putting two of its own
    artists on the tracklist, but Dr. Dog and the Capitol Years both turn in
    excellent songs. Dr. Dog's ""Worst Trip"" is great horn- and harmony-laden indie
    rock with a sticky chorus, while their labelmates turn down the volume on
    ""Seven Songs"", a sparse acoustic folk track with lush vocal
    harmonies. Secretary
    Bird, a band helmed by longtime Friend of Dean Martinez Mike Semple, contribute ""Tio"",
    a great, twangy song with a huge guitar hook and a big chorus that reminds me a
    bit of Grant Lee Buffalo.
    </p>
<p>
    Among the hits are a few minor misses-- chiefly the closer,
    Monsieur Leroc's bizarre ""Me So Hungry"", a jarring track in this context that's kind of hip-hop, but
    with essentially inept rapping. And Spoon's ""Was It You"" never was <em>Gimme Fiction</em>'s<em> </em>most engaging moment, which holds true here as well. I'd rather have heard a middling new track from them than a middling old one, at any rate.
    </p>
<p>
    Overall, the disc is fairly worthwhile, particularly for Friends of Dean Martinez fans-- the lack of visual context doesn't really hurt
    their seven tracks here. The artwork is naturally full of film stills, all cut up and arranged into the shape of the lower 48 in the center spread, along with obligatory close-ups of eerily glistening burgers and fries. The music here ultimately mirrors the film's setting in the big-sky country just east of the Rockies more than it does the fattening subject of its
    critique, but that's just as well-- the alternative might have been lecturing
    social commentary.

    Dirk Dresselhaus, the former indie-rock drummer behind Schneider TM, is constantly toeing the line between genius and also-ran. While a lot of his peers in this corner of the electronic-pop world settle for playing acoustic guitar and singing sheepishly over tired drum-machine programming, Dresselhaus has created a totally original-- and totally captivating-- way of making music; laptop processing meshes seamlessly with mallet instruments, synth texture meshes seamlessly with voice, and the result is always instantly identifiable as his. When he's on his game, as he was through the brilliant first half of 2002's <em>Zoomer</em>, his tracks are a steamy, bubbly bath of sound: buzzing keyboards, whooshes and swirls, backwards blips and clicks, spangles of guitars and strings. Over all of which Dresselhaus lazily harmonizes, in a voice that's 20% blue-eyed soul, 20% Sam Prekop, and 60% stoned surfer-- in other words, something like a German Beck.</p><p>
    And yet he still manages to spend a good chunk of every album sounding like a second-stringer. When he's <em>not</em> entirely on his game, he still sounds brilliant, but he still sounds baked: The latter half of <em>Zoomer</em> felt like one of those times when stoned musicians go down the rabbit hole, totally enthralled by the grooves they're making, while the audience starts checking its collective watch.</p><p>
    In that regard, <em>Skoda Mluvit</em>, which slipped out this year without much fanfare or publicity, feels even messier than Schneider TM's last LP: It sounds like Dresselhaus has spent the past few years holed up alone in his Berlin studio, surrounded by a huge pile of hand drums and xylophones, digging deeper and deeper into his own head. And on some tracks, that means pushing his productions to whole new levels of genius. ""Cataractact"" and ""Pac Man/ Shopping Cart"" reprise the sunny, propulsive hums of <em>Zoomer</em>, and beautifully: The former threads acoustic guitar through a perfect tangle of whooshing drums and wandering synths, while the latter pushes elegant string samples into a woozy blur. On ""Peanut"" and especially ""Caplets"", Dresselhaus brings the guitar to the forefront for a kind of graceful studio blues-- as played on acoustic instruments, but so transformed by his recording that it becomes otherworldly.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, of course, Dresselhaus' technical ideas start to outshine his musical ones, and the record drifts off into any number of odd cul-de-sacs: a four-minute motorik intro on ""More Time"", six minutes of hazy, underwater stasis on ""The Slide"", and more of Schneider TM's intriguingly odd version of ""rap"" on ""The Blacksmith"". It doesn't help that his lyrics remain as stonerish as his singing voice, and not always in the cute way: Addressing what must be American neocons on ""Vodou"", he asks, ""Who do they think they are, and what has Jesus got to do with shit?""
    </p>
<p>
    And there's something in that vibe that does him in. Taken alone, even the worst tracks here are musically fascinating and technically enthralling-- Dresselhaus is spending way too much time programming each one to just be jacking around. And yet something about the distance between the shiny pop of ""Cataractact"" and the scattered jumble of fresh ideas elsewhere tends to make you think that he is-- or else that, for once, we're dealing with a guy with too <em>many</em> odd ideas to follow them all up without embarrassing himself. (If ""The Blacksmith"" sounds dopey to you, it might be because what Dresselhaus is trying to pull off in it is-- subtly and secretly-- incredibly ambitious: gamelan IDM soul-rap? With a violin break?) Dresselhaus doesn't seem like the kind of guy who'll ever offer us an album that's entirely focused, coherent, or even a good idea the whole way through, but he's still got the kind of talent that deserves attention; just cut him a little slack when he gets a little stoned on you, okay? I'd still rather hear his weirder ideas than most people's predictable ones.

    Is there another mainstream pop star who
    flits between lights-on likeability and pouty-lipped empty vesseldom
    as dramatically or frequently as Gwen Stefani?
    In the three years since abandoning the MTV rock ghetto she inhabited with No Doubt, and her subsequent self-reinvention as a certifiable pop celeb and fashionplate mogul, she's been doing wind
    sprints between these two incompatible personae. Nonetheless,
    since going solo with 2004's patchy but single-rich<em> Love.Angel.Music.Baby.</em>, Stefani's remained above the fray of the ongoing clusterfuck between commerce and art-- and she's done it by brand-building
    in both the abstract sense (via her quest for pop cultural memes) and in the more
    traditional sense (with her clothing line L.A.M.B. scoring bonus
    cross-promotional hits with every in-song mention).</p><p>
    Of course, Stefani also deserves credit for her gutsy
    musical choices. The spazzy, overcaffeinated electro of past
    singles like ""What You Waiting For?"" and the sparse drumline squibbles of
    ""Hollaback Girl"" suggest she's not content to merely rack
    up hits; she also wants her game to be the freshest around. That's a desirable
    instinct in a pop star, and despite her predilection for hijacking what feels
    like every single empty space on <em>The Sweet Escape</em> to play her own hypegirl (""How sick is this?"" she beams in the
    intro to ""Breakin' Up"", minutes before declaring ""Don't Get It Twisted"" ""the
    most craziest shit ever""), her single-minded interest in smuggling the weirdest
    sounds onto TRL results in some of <em>The
    Sweet Escape's</em> finest moments.</p><p>
    Case in point: Lead single ""Wind It Up"", which wraps a
    ""Lonely Goatherd"" yodel sample from Stefani's beloved <em>The Sound of Music</em> around a wriggly Neptunes
    beat. As mainstream singles go, it's an absurd-sounding concoction that skates
    perilously close to the edge of utter ridiculousness, but something about the sheer
    nerviness of the idea ultimately sees it through. If I had to guess at a
    single from this year that eventually ingratiated itself to the highest number of first-time haters, this
    would probably be it, and in Stefani's world, that's like the Holy Grail. Unlike
    most pop singers, Stefani aims to win you over with oddity. (There's a reason <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> was her last album's most recurrant theme.)</p><p>
    It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but most of <em>The Sweet Escape's</em> other gonzo pop songs
    yield some degree of payout. ""Now That You Got It"" surfs on a loping hip-hop beat
    and a staccato piano sample while Stefani splits wailing time with a chorus of
    alarms. The Neptunes-produced ""Yummy"" earns Best Song status by moving from a
    skeletal rhythmic backbone and resounding ""Milkshake""-pinching triangle hit
    into a spiralling melody line that sounds like a Sherman Brothers outtake.  Also, ""Don't Get It Twisted"" sounds like
    reggaeton-polka.</p><p>
    Thing is, it takes real time to wring genius out of the
    obscure and unseemly, and time is not a luxury that Stefani the entrepreneur affords
    herself. As such, most of <em>The Sweet Escape's</em> problems arise as a result of her schedule-dicated slog back
    towards middle ground. With the exception of the spazzy, Akon-produced doo-wop
    track ""The Sweet Escape"" and the Keane-penned ""Early Winter""-- which proves that
    Stefani still has the ability to elevate an otherwise ordinary rock song to another level--
    everything else here has the vague whiff of tossed-off album fattener. The
    unofficial sequel to ""What You Waiting For?"", ""Orange County Girl"" boasts
    another self-writing lyric (""Don't know what I'm doing back in the studio/
    Getting greedy cause he said he had another sick flow/ So I had to hollaback
    cause I didn't get enough/ Still feel the Wonderland, Alice and the tick
    tock"") that, in a Charle Kaufman-aping stylee, mistakes meta for content.  Elsewhere, ""4 in the Morning"" and ""U Started
    It"" exhume the ghosts of S Club and Debbie Gibson respectively, in turn
    destroying the mallpop cred that Stefani accrued with <em>L.A.M.B.</em>'s
    impeccable ""Cool"".</p><p>
    By now you get the point. One step forward, three steps
    sideways, one step back, <em>The Sweet Escape</em>
    continues in Stefani's proud tradition of being caught somewhere between the
    vanguard and the insipid. Considering this is the same person who once rolled
    out ""Hollaback Girl"" and the Harajuku girls in one fell swoop, it's not the
    least bit surprising, but the pockets of brilliance here are compelling enough to

    It seems wholly unnecessary to note that Bob Wills was an
    important and influential country artist who has inspired a legion of
    followers. As Rich Kienzle points out in his informative if dry liner notes
    to the 4xCD <em>Legends of Country Music</em>, Wills was ahead of his
    time in almost every step of his four-decade career. In the 1930s, he incorporated horns and reeds into his
    raucous brand of Texas Swing, punctuating songs like ""My Confession"" and ""New
    Spanish Two Step"" with bursts of brassy rhythms. In the 1940s, he added live
    drums, electric guitar, lap steel, even electric mandolin-- you just didn't do
    that and expect to play the Opry. And yet, Wills got a standing ovation when
    the Texas Playboys performed there, after smuggling a drum set on stage. Later
    songs like ""Fat Boy Rag"" and ""Hometown Stomp"" percolate with percussive rhythms
    and steely riffs, although these sounds have been so thoroughly absorbed into
    popular music that it's difficult-- if not downright impossible-- to grasp how
    subversive these additions would have been at the time.</p><p>
    By all reports the Texas Playboys also put on one hell of a live show.
    Kienzle describes Wills dancing around the stage and in between the musicians, all
    the while playing his fiddle and calling out soloists. That would have been a
    sight, and it's likely his enthusiasm proved infectious to his band members and
    his audiences alike. Even on these studio and radio tracks, though, you can
    hear him verbally high-stepping around the songs, commanding solos (steel
    guitarist Leon McAuliffe never recorded a dull one), answering Tommy
    Duncan's unflappable vocals with his own ad libs (effectively establishing a
    straight-man/fall-guy dynamic), and letting loose one of his signature
    ah-haaaaaa's whenever the mood struck. And it struck often. That ah-haaaaa,
    sung in a versatile falsetto, became his trademark, comparable to contemporary
    catchphrases like ""What's up, Doc?"" or ""Play it again, Sam"". (I know, I know:
    Rick Blaine never actually says that line.)</p><p>
    A century after his birth, more than 50 years after his
    heyday, and 30 years after his death, the Texas Playboys' feats of musical
    derring-do have lost none of their excitement, as <em>Legends of Country Musi</em>c persuasively attests. These four discs cover
    the era between 1934, when Wills' band, the Light Crust Dough Boys, was a
    permanent fixture at KFJZ in Fort Worth,
    and 1971, when he performed his final sessions in a wheelchair. He had bases in
    three states and recorded for a handful of labels, but the styles he commanded
    were innumerable. Voraciously, the Texas Playboys consumed and performed stomps
    and rags, blues and swing, hot jazz, country, jug band, Zydeco, even rock'n'roll, cramming each song full to bursting with contrasting sounds and rhythms.
    Bolstered by strong
    melodies and Wills' graceful, ingenious fiddling, songs like ""Miss Molly"",
    ""Stay a Little Longer"", and ""Sarah Goodin'"" are filled with cartoon imagery
    along the lines of ""Sittin' in the window singin' to my love/ Slop bucket fell
    from the window up above/ Mule and the grasshopper eatin' ice cream/ Mule got
    sick so they laid him on the green"". Not to consign Wills to the children's music
    ghetto, but that sure beats the Wiggles.
    </p>
<p>
    By showcasing the excitement of Wills's music, <em>Legends of Country Music</em> also argues for
    its durability and I suppose even its universality. And yet, it's impossible to
    hear any of these songs in their original context. Radio stations now employ DJs and marketers, not house bands. Besides, Los Angeles--
    where Wills and musicians like Spade Cooley and Tex Ritter put the Western in
    Country &amp; Western-- doesn't even have a country radio station anymore. What's
    more, the Texas Playboys developed their madcap style on dancehall stages in
    front of hundreds of local fans. It was a social music. Since World War II,
    however, America
    has become increasingly less social, preferring to stay in and watch
    television. There are still concerts, but not of the type that made the Texas
    Playboys famous. The music hasn't changed over the years, but the way we hear
    it and pass it along certainly has. It sounds far removed from most
    contemporary popular music today, especially radio country. Even the lascivious
    double entendres sound tame, surprising only because we don't expect hits from
    this period to address sex (""Oozlin' Daddy Blues"") or drugs (""Ding Dong Daddy
    (from Dumas)"").
    </p>
<p>
    History can be a little dry and lineages of influences positively
    arid. To its considerable credit, <em>Legends
    of Country Music</em> isn't one of those good-for-you box sets that comes across like four
    servings of brussel sprouts. The music sounds just as lively and infectious as
    the day it was created, even if its audience has changed dramatically. This set portrays Wills as more than
    a band leader: Both in the recording booth and on the stage, he was a masterful
    fiddler, a demanding coach, a persuasive salesman, an endearing cartoon, and a
    tireless pioneer. Even toward the end of his life, after lone performers like
    Hank Williams had overthrown big bands like the Texas Playboys-- and after a
    stroke left him with a shake in his voice and unable to play the fiddle-- on his final tracks he sounds surprisingly strong, his falsetto irrepressible
    and incorrigible. Thirty years later, it remains relevant and still retains
    that edge, if only digitally.

    If teenage dreams are hard to beat, it's only because they're so vivid. I
    mean, adolescence has its own peculiar torments, and the tragedies and triumphs
    of those fraught hair-getting years seem to occur on a vast, existential scale:
    The first cut is the deepest, and then you drown in it. When ur-teenager Holden
    Caulfield finds the world full of phonies, he sets off trying to save children
    everywhere from its moral perils; in <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>,
    young Aureliano Buendía discovers love and expresses it ""in poetry that
    had no beginning and no end."" Some of us just made asses of ourselves--
    huge, Wreckx-N-Effect asses.</p><p>
    The debut from Glasgow's the Twilight Sad articulates youthful emotional
    grandeur with all the eloquence of hindsight. When scars become anthems, old
    wounds are never far beneath the surface. The quartet's five-song EP pierces
    singer James Graham's embattled burr and quixotic lyrics with guitars that
    shimmer, creak, and finally twist in upon themselves before crumbling, like a
    flame-ravaged house, into noisy rubble. With composer Max Richter co-producing,
    the Twilight Sad's dramatic use of space aligns them with arty labelmates like
    Animal Collective and Sigur Rós, and the EP's epic scope makes the group an
    angst-ridden younger brother to London avant-popsters Guillemots. Raise your
    lighters, y'all, but you're wearing headphones. And you're mad lonely.</p><p>
    So, kids today-- they all right? Happily, nah. ""The kids are on fire in
    the bedroom,"" Graham sings amid accordion and earth-quaking drums on
    ""That Summer, At Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy"" (typical of the
    Twilight Sad's titles), about a troubled 14-year-old with a broken heart.
    During the trance-like cymbal swirl of ""Last Year's Rain Didn't Fall Quite
    So Hard"", Graham's narrator admits, ""I only wanna say goodbye,""
    while ""3 Seconds of Dead Air"" slowly crescendos through almost nine
    minutes, hearing secrets after everybody else and ""holding on for too
    long""-- a welcome surfeit. Ah, yes: the Twilight Miserable. 
    </p>
<p>
    Sure, but, in the best way. Like the Walkmen, the Twilight Sad rehabilitate
    the U2 stadium anthem by rescuing it from the post-Coldplay kingdom: the
    Glaswegian mopers through lip-quivering emotion punctuated with explosions
    rather than their New York peers' subway-wind exhortations. With a sound as
    big, aching, and volatile as their songs, the Twilight Sad remind us that
    adulthood-- soulless jobs that never pay enough, precious free time squandered
    accidentally hurting people you love, even sleepless hours locked in staring
    contests with an unblinking ceiling-- still isn't as generally crappy as <em>becoming</em>
    an adult. Nor, potentially, as exquisite.

She's great to have around when you've been brained by a GrImp or poisoned by a killer octopus. But when your party's healthy or she runs out of magic points, there isn't much for her to do besides whack huge dragons with a wooden stick. The Black Mage is more useful, bombing on monsters with hellacious attack spells, but sometimes-- like when your eyes are bleeding from a goblin punch-- you wish he had a little healing magic up his sleeve as well.</p><p>
    Enter the versatile Red Mage, who can learn a selection of White <em>and </em>Black spells. I'm telling you all of this at great personal cost (do you think I'm <em>proud</em> to know so much about <em>Final Fantasy</em>?) because Red Magic, according to the <em>FF</em> taxonomy, would be a more accurate name for this band's blend of the salutary and the malevolent than White Magic.</p><p>
<em>Dat Rosa Mel Apibus</em> is a strange potion, more freak than folk, constructed mainly from simple, chunky piano patterns, dizzily swirling harmonies, droning strings, and Mira Billotte's booming lead vocals. It certainly has its intoxicating qualities. ""The Light"", in particular, is bright and fresh, allowing listeners to settle comfortably in its mysterious seams, where the incantatory vocals blur into the oceanic ebb and flow of the music. But it also exercises a darker thrall on some tracks: ""Katie Cruel"" is a fairytale excursion into a shadowy wood, its spindly acoustic guitar scrolling by like the silhouettes of bare branches overhead.
    </p><p>
    These are songs that seem to proceed by intuition more than order, couched in structures so loosely defined that they sometimes hardly seem like structures at all. ""Hear My Call"" is a slowly somersaulting waltz with wobbling pianos and a vocal line that repeatedly flutters up from its sturdy, monotonous perch. The music on <em>Dat Rosa Mel Apibus</em> is consistently engaging, with a lucid yet forebodingly weird quality, but it's Billotte's spectral presence that truly distinguishes it. There's no hesitancy in her oracular vocalizations, which stretch like taffy in a puller. She sounds right at home amid the sinuous, Far Eastern purr of ""Sea Chanty"" and ""All the World Went"", and leaves a contrasting, sticky residue on the bright <em>Sesame Street</em> jangle of ""Childhood Song"" and the brambly guitars of ""What I See"". Some might complain that these magicians only know one trick, but it's a really good one, leaving you searching for the invisible wires and hidden mirrors long after the footlights have darkened.

    It's a bad day when you step on gum left on the sidewalk, but it's worse
    when you step in a dog's mess or someone's vomit from the night before, hazards
    left behind by careless urbanites. These thoughtless people upend mega tubs of
    popcorn the moment they get into a movie theater and use the bathroom at work
    right before you having never, ever heard the term ""courtesy flush.""
    We're kept from confronting such inconsideration and general nastiness because
    we never know exactly who these despicable culprits are.</p><p>
    The Dirty Faces are these kind of people. They don't just skirt filth-rock
    cliché; they revel in it. The best moments on <em>Get Right With God</em> tread
    the line between keeping it simple and sounding stupid like they're doing
    pirouettes on a pommel horse. A shame that all those moments are at the
    beginning of the album: ""Dead Man's Boots"" is as close to a manifesto
    you'll hear from the band, dramatically strumming one chord over a brutally
    simple drum pattern while singer T. Glitter wails on about his daily routine
    (""I wake up, I go to work/ I work hard, 'cause I'm a jerk""),
    condemning everyone nearby, including himself. ""Somnambulist's
    Vacation"" isn't nearly as clever as the vocab-flashing title suggests, but
    it's a spirited and sloppy romp nonetheless, as is the syncopated thrashing and
    sin-glorification of ""Sister Redux"".</p><p>
    But as the pace lessens, their dependence on well-worn tropes becomes more
    apparent. The legato and bluesy ""Like a Thief"" is a serious lag in
    momentum, sounding like limp Make-Up (further reinforced by female counterpoint
    vocals). The same goes for the appropriately titled ""Slow Train"",
    though it's partly redeemed by some over-the-top vocal adlibs. Why they wanted
    to build an album around these interminable centerpieces, I'm not sure; it's
    far from the best they have to offer. ""Rocky Bleier"" is a spike in
    tempo with some Onieda-esque mono-note organ blurts, but that and ""Push
    it... (Begin)"" sound half as inspired sandwiched between the dual
    monoliths of dullness. </p><p>
    The two-chord pummeling of ""Punkin Pie"" is almost reckless enough to
    redeem the band, but the piano roll of ""The War from Above"" sounds
    like a tired genre exercise despite a few golden tossed-off lyrics
    (""History is written by the sinners/ And read by the listless
    beginners""). Dirty Faces don't update these moves, just make them sound as
    filthy as possible to sound as authentic as possible-- and that's not a bad
    start. Still, your response to <em>Get Right With God</em> will depend on your
    tolerance to established Stones-by-way-of-Stooges form, regardless of how
    decadent and inconsiderate Dirty Faces make it sound.

I'm talking about the sidemen, the backing bands, the producers, whose names are known only to the most ardent of sleeve-note scholars and biographers, and whose importance is recognized all too rarely.  Elvis Presley had Scotty Moore and Sam Phillips, Bob Dylan had Al Kooper and Bob Johnston, David Bowie had Brian Eno and Mick Ronson, all integral parts of the sound that made each one famous, but doomed to never grace the marquee alongside the featured star.</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Neil Young has run through a whole wardrobe of identities, each with its own critical supporting cast: a handful of country-rock bands with Stephen Stills, his seminal acoustic records with Nashville session supergroup the Stray Gators, tours and records with Booker T. &amp; the MG's and Pearl Jam.  But the group that Young returns to again and again is perhaps the unlikeliest, certainly not the most famous, and definitely not the most technically polished.  Since 1969, Crazy Horse have been the three-piece engine that has fueled some of Young's most iconic work, and he has repaid them with the kind of equal billing that unsung sidemen so infrequently receive.</p>
<p>The proof is pictured on the cover of <i>Live at the Fillmore East</i>, where Young made the venue's sign-letter putter-upper do the extra work of spelling out his backing band's name alongside his own.  At the time, Young was coming off an insanely successful record and tour with Crosby, Stills, and Nash, but he brushed them aside to play shows with the band that had backed him on his breakout solo statement <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>: Danny Whitten, Billy Talbot, and Ralph Molina.  Unknown, unpolished, even untalented (according to some), Crazy Horse were the complete antithesis of the polished and fashionable CSN, yet they helped Young achieve his apocalyptic garage-rock visions more vividly than the awkward compromises of the industry-assembled supergroup ever could.</p>
<p>Ironically, given Crazy Horse's oft-documented lack of technical ability, these 1970 shows took place at the time in rock history when improvisation was prized almost to the point of being a requirement.  The Fillmore itself was a venue closely associated with the marathon jam sessions of bands like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers, and Miles Davis' fusion experiments actually shared the bill with Young &amp; Crazy Horse.  Young's contribution to this trend were his fraternal-twin epics ""Down By the River"" and ""Cowgirl in the Sand"", each with grand valleys of open space between brief scripted moments of verse and chorus.  This release is dominated by those two songs, both of which gallivant past the 10-minute mark without ever growing stale, perfect demonstrations of the chemistry between frontman and supporters.  The rhythm section of Talbot and Molina is anything but tight or flashy, but their dinosaur lope contains enough unpredictability to give the band a weird sort of swing, the bedrock upon which Danny Whitten and Neil Young stage their guitar conversations.  The myth of Whitten has always been cloudy, his heroin habit having extinguished his much-lauded talent and, eventually, his life just as Crazy Horse started to gain a reputation, but it's on full display here, his ever-evolving rhythm parts combining with guest Jack Nitzsche's electric-piano to steer the jam sections' flow, giving Young plenty of room to lay down his alternately sad and angry note-choked leads.</p>
<p>Between these monumental performances, the set's other songs are almost like smoke breaks, brief bits of the heartfelt, ragged pop Young specialized in circa <i>After the Goldrush</i>.  Relative rarity ""Winterlong"" is the gem of these shorter tracks, one of the sweetest songs in Young's electric repertoire, with a romantic aura made somehow more genuine by the hilariously broken harmonies.  ""Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown"" is the Horse's spotlight, Whitten showing that he was arguably a better, or at least more traditionally rock'n'roll, singer than his boss-- a reminder that he essentially sings the lead part on ""Cinnamon Girl"", Young's biggest electric radio hit.</p>
<p>Yet as the first release of the long-promised purge of Young's extensive archives, the format of <i>Live at the Fillmore East</i> is condescendingly slight, selecting only highlights from the band's two-night/four-show run rather than providing complete, unabridged sets.  For a band whose genius sprouts from imperfections and serendipitous mistakes, it's a disservice to deny Young's rabid fanbase unedited release of tapes that have been so long anticipated; they were recorded at the time for a live album that was later scrapped.  But the few scraps they deemed worthy of release are nevertheless enough to justify the legendary status of Crazy Horse's early days, and explain why it was an easy call for Young to make the rare ""solo artist"" decision of treating his collaborators as equal partners.</p></div>"|9687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9687-live-at-the-fillmore-east/|8.2|Rob Mitchum

""Sometimes we fight, sometimes we run,"" he croaks in that old-man deadpan he perfected as a youth, ""It's just like playing football.../ With a gun"". The song is driven by a crackling livewire guitar riff, which just happens to have fallen off the back of Howlin' Wolf's ""Smokestack Lightnin'"". It's a timely tip of the hat, since Hazlewood's picaresque adventure through post-war American pop really hit paydirt exactly 50 years ago, when guitarist Al Casey (who's all over the new record) applied his approximation of that very riff to Hazlewood's unassuming country number, ""The Fool"", then gave it to Sanford Casey to take to No. 7 in the Billboard charts in August 1956.</p><p>
    ""The Fool"" was Hazlewood's first hit, but it bore all the hallmarks of his mature style: a laconic song of lost love, sung by a baleful baritone and recorded just a few blocks down Lonely Street from Heartbreak Hotel, right at the bottom of the Well of Loneliness. With a few cosmetic touches, it became a formula Hazlewood was to take all the way from his indie rock and roll beginnings in mid-50s Arizona, on to international success as the co-writer and producer of Duane Eddy, a spell writing hits for Dean Martin, the golden years of screwball pop with Nancy Sinatra, a stint producing her dad and composing movie scores, a pause to help give birth to country rock (via the International Submarine Band, who released their posthumous debut on his LHI label in 1968), before heading off to see the world, and, in particular, Sweden, where he made award-winning TV shows and hilarious, heartbreaking solo albums throughout the 1970s.</p><p>
<em>Cake or Death</em> could well be Hazlewood's 30th album-- the discography is a little sketchy-- but unhappily it's almost certainly his last, since he was diagnosed earlier this year with renal cancer. At such a time it must be tempting to speed-dial Rick Rubin, schedule some shots with Anton Corbijn, call in favors from your celebrity buddies, and spiff yourself up as an American Legend, Soberly Confronting Death. But sobriety has never been Hazlewood's style, and <em>Cake or Death</em> is as daffy, cornball and absurdly touching as anything he's put his name to over the last half century. ""Fred Freud"", for starters, is a string-driven thing that imagines the existence of a smarter Freud Deud-- one who realises ""no kisses or posies can cure your neuroses"" and so prescribes a course of listening to Bach or Mozart instead. And the extract from ""Some Velvet Morning""-- perhaps the most sumptuous, slyly subversive of Hazlewood's pop fantasies-- is sung here by his 8-year-old granddaughter, Phaedra, who naturally supposes the song is about her.
    </p><p>
    Who could bemoan the guy such indulgence? Especially when he includes a gorgeous version of ""Please Come to Boston"", sung with great gusto by Ann Kristin Hedmark-- according to Lee, ""the best lady jazz singer in Scandinavia"", and, from the sound of her, apparently from that elusive part of Scandinavia that lies below the Mason-Dixon line. Or ""It's Nothing to Me"": A version of a hillbilly ballad recorded by Hazlewood protégé Loy Clingman in 1957, here, with a whispered performance set in a lush production from Lasse Samuelsson, sounding like the greatest song Lambchop never recorded.
    </p>
<p>
    As ""Baghdad Knights"" suggests, there's also a fair bit of state-of-the-nation addressing. What can they do now, boycott him? ""Anthem"" is a spirited bluesy strut, a few righteous redneck words from one Texan mock-cowboy to another, while ""White People Thing"" provides another outing for that Smokestack riff, accompanying a bitter acknowledgement that America really is a land of milk and honey, providing you're wealthy and white.
    </p>
<p>
    But the song that makes the album, and provides the punchline to this peerless pop career is the final song, ""T.O.M. (The Old Man)"". Dedicated to his wife, it's an unbearably poignant update of ""Wonderful World"". ""Have you seen the mountains?"" he wonders in that rueful growl of his, ""They still hug the snow/ And have you seen the Old Man?/ He's ready to go"". All of us who still believe in the promise, beauty, and comedy of popular music should raise a glass to the old man.<br/>

<em>Pleasure Ground</em> is Dominick Fernow (aka Prurient) at his simplest and most powerful. Originally released on a double cassette by Fernow's Hospital Productions, the album contains four 11-minute, hypnotically uncomplicated tracks. His black din and bruising screams continue to test ears, but Fernow's noise is never sloppy, hewing to repetitive patterns that build into trances. Calling this the most accessible Prurient album is like calling the Antarctic sun warm, but anyone who finds previous releases forbidding might be surprised by how much there is to latch onto here.</p><p>
    Fernow begins with a piercing tone similar to the opening salvo on his last effort for Load, <em>Black Vase</em>.  That record's siren rang for 15 minutes, but here crunching jolts quickly break up the dog-whistle spine of ""Military Road"". A lung-stretching howl soon chimes in, extending a lone stanza (""Will you miss the abuse/ The intimate violence/ The parade of bruises/ The badge of punishment?"") into a glacial mantra. Doling out his words in metered chunks, Fernow's singing mirrors the rhythmic lurch of his surrounding noise.</p><p>
    ""Military Road"" sets a template that the rest of <em>Pleasure Ground</em> perfects: Long tones and extended screams sliced into simple patterns. These protracted pieces can be intense, but they're also surprisingly song-like, like three-chord punk tunes stretched to painfully beautiful extremes. ""Earthworks/Buried in Secret"" follows with descending chords that bend and collapse under the weight of Fernow's fire-breathing.  Here he turns four words-- ""what of this destruction""-- into a novel's worth of abstract vowels and consonants. His lyrics in the past have teetered between dark poetry and gothic cartoon, but on <em>Pleasure Ground</em> their simplicity is effective.
    </p>
<p>
    The album's final two pieces pull Fernow's approach into new territory.  ""Outdoorsman/Indestructible"" is a Prurient first: A piece so quiet you actually have to turn it up. Over a distant rumble, Fernow moans a Haiku-like description of burning paper falling to the ground.  The music's restraint is similarly Zen-- even a final burst of singing sounds stoic, like an eerie calm after a storm. ""Apple Tree Victim"" is even better. Like a black-noise version of Fennesz's ""A Year In a Minute,"" the piece loops distorted chords under Fernow's lyrics, which equate sexual climax with gory death. Prurient records can feel like footnotes to Fernow's engulfing live show, whose muscular workouts whittle arena-sized metal to its purest core. But ""Apple Tree Victim"" captures his sweaty stage energy perfectly, and it's difficult to imagine Fernow topping it or the rest of <em>Pleasure Ground</em> anytime soon.

    In the avant/noise/rock underground, endless shape-shifting has long
    since become the norm. Witness the sly name changes of (D) Yellow
    Swans, the constant mutations of the Jewelled Antler Collective, the
    fluid personnel lineups of bands like Sunburned Hand of the Man, and
    the rampant intramural collaborations happening virtually anywhere you
    care to look. Amid this swarm of loose identities the Houston-based
    outfit Indian Jewelry have been known to take things a step further,
    actively adding and subtracting musicians in various cities as they
    tour. This free-form approach puts a premium on communal expression and
    seat-of-pants invention, but often does so at the expense of any sort
    of cohesive authorial vision. It's a methodology that makes for a
    pleasant if somewhat bewildering spin on the group's latest
    full-length <em>Invasive Exotics</em>.</p><p>
    Houston has produced and nurtured its fair share of
    musical outsiders, and Indian Jewelry here pay brief oblique homage to
    their fertile local history with ""Partying With Jandek"", a title which,
    one assumes, to be likely a case of wishful thinking. Unlike Jandek or
    other such iconoclastic Houston natives as the Red Krayola or
    Charalambides, however, Indian Jewelry's music is seldom organized
    around any one particular individual voice.</p><p>
    For <em>Invasive Exotics</em>, the group is built upon the core trio
    of Tex Kerschen, Erika Thrasher, and Rodney Rodriguez, although too
    much is typically happening at any given moment to assign clear roles
    or fully complete an accurate scorecard. As such the group's philosophy
    is perhaps best exemplified by their oft-repeated collectivist motto
    ""We Are Legion"". And though their music's resulting lack-of-center can
    frequently cause the album to unspool with jarring contrasts and false
    leads, it does allow Indian Jewelry to capture the occasional moment of
    perfect, accidental symmetry likely to be unattainable by solo
    explorers. 
    </p>
<p>
    Few of Indian Jewelry's loftier ambitions are immediately visible on
    album opener ""Lesser Snakes"", a pulverizing slab of garage-rock that's
    anarchic enough to recall vintage Cheater Slicks. Here, as on the
    primal thud of ""Powwow"", there's a psychedelic glint to the group's
    distorted vocals and scrambled guitars that seems to draw its Texan
    lineage directly from the Butthole Surfers' <em>Locust Abortion Technician</em> or <em>Hairway to Steven</em>.
    That's some heady company, to be sure, but apparently this crew have
    decided not keep it for long. Instead, they soon abandon all interest
    in unruly psych-punk forward motion and abruptly segue into the unlit,
    smoggy pulse of ""Dirty Hands"" and the opiated siren call ""Come Closer"",
    whose menacing electronic drones and submerged rhythms curl and billow
    like stray clouds of squid ink across the seafloor. 
    </p>
<p>
    Enticing though these tracks can be, the group don't really hit their
    stride until their 10-minute mid-album epic ""Going South"" a piece which
    is about as close as <em>Invasive Exotics</em>
    ever comes to establishing a signature sound. Over a derelict house
    beat the musicians achieve a nearly ideal balance of murky synth blats,
    disembodied guitar figures, and obscurantist vocal gibberish worthy of
    such contemporaries as Excepter or Black Dice. Predictably enough, once
    the song ends Indian Jewelry are promptly on to their next conquest,
    touching on the chirpy post-punk of ""Health and Well-Being"", the
    fractured electronica of ""Lying on the Floor"", and the blurred
    Krautrock repetitions of ""Lost My Sight"" before retiring for the night.
    To the band's credit, each of these many detours is enjoyable enough to
    make their fellow travelers unlikely to want to quit the road
    altogether. At some point, however, one has to hope that Indian Jewelry
    eventually find the direction to move their <em>Invasive Exotics</em> into a more suitable permanent habitat.

    to ask the question: Why would you want to watch an indie kid dance? You'll
    just make them feel self-conscious and awkward, which is sort of how you
    feel listening to Mixel Pixel's third album. On <em>Music for Plants</em>, the
    kaleidoscopic Brooklyn popsters continue the digitization process that began on
    last year's <em>Contact Kid</em>, but wind up with an indie/electro compromise
    that's too busy for stoned-in-the-basement contemplation, but too sluggish to
    coax you onto the dancefloor.</p><p>
    The problem isn't that Mixel Pixel are playing with incongruent tech/psych
    elements-- of all forms of rock music, psychedelia is most compatible with
    dance music's exploratory and transcendental intents-- but that the songs too
    often favor density over intensity. Their productions are rich in details but
    languorous in execution; the band seem particularly fond of the sitar-tinged
    shuffle grooves and Atari bleeps that Beck deployed to more charismatic effect
    during his Dust Brothers days, but rarely seem motivated to break out of
    their metronomic gait or beef up the beats beyond a Casiotone click. Even their
    most flagrant discotheque maneuver, ""Coming Up X's"", comes off as
    Ladytron-lite, hamstrung by a clunky chorus guitar riff that dulls the song's
    synth-pop sheen.</p><p>
    It's hard to tell whether Music for Plant's slackadasical air is exaggerated
    by Rob Corradetti's arch, deadpan delivery or vice versa; while his faux-Brit
    sing-speak is an ideal fit for the icy Teutonic disco of ""Turkish
    Delights"", it sounds considerably more stilted when attempting
    straight-faced come-ons like ""hey baby, do you like the way I dance""
    (on ""Switchblade Sister""). And though Kaia Wong provides sweet relief
    when trading lines on ""You're the Kind of Girl"" and ""Behind the
    Sun"" (the only track here to threaten the 180bpm mark), her voice doesn't
    really complement Corradetti's on their shared parts: the two don't so much
    harmonize as sing over top one another, making the mixes feel even more
    cluttered. So it follows that the album's most satisfying moment comes when
    their voices drop out on ""Switchblade Sister"" for an extended
    synth-freaked outro that constitutes a rare moment where Mixel Pixel tweak the
    mind and body with equal authority. Because as much as Corradetti and Wong try
    to convince you that ""there's a party going on,"" for the most part
    that invite carries all the hollow promise of a doorman forcing patrons to
    line-up for an empty nightclub.</p></div>"|9650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9650-music-for-plants/|5.5|Stuart Berman

Though their songs could be as transgressive as the Velvet Underground's, the Doors are denied the same name-drop cachet, their legend reduced to a punchline-- no thanks to a 1991 Oliver Stone biopic more self-indulgent than the band itself, and recent efforts by Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger to revive the band with Ian Astbury as the Doors of the 21st century, like some reality-TV-show experiment minus the TV-show part.</p><p>
    Amid these sorry attempts to update the Doors' legacy, it's easy to forget that without Morrison's brooding baritone, there'd be no Iggy, no Ian Curtis, and it's safe to say that Morrison taught Bono more about rocking a Jesus Christ pose than JC himself. So <em>Perception</em>'s extensive repackaging of the Doors' six albums (each complemented by a bonus disc of DVD footage and Surround Sound mixes) arrives at a fortuitous time-- not because it coincides with the band's 40th anniversary, but because it helps contemporize a band tethered to a 1960s hippie ideal to which, spiritually, it often stood in opposition.</p><p>
    For all the mythology surrounding the band, the Doors-- like so many 60s garage-rockers-- arguably peaked with their first single. ""Break on Through (To the Other Side)"" is a taunt and a dare, drawing the line between who was down and who was out. But the 1967 debut album that the song introduced wasn't your typical <em>Nuggets</em>-variety noise, looking to the Weill/Brecht songbook for ""Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)"" and beyond pop structure entirely for ""The End"". The 11-minute closer set the standard for the Doors' long songs: Morrison dropping stream-of-consciousness prose in the place where most bands would put the guitar solo, his words gradually wearing down the players' accompaniment before summoning them back for the climax. ""The End"" is also the song that helped define the Morrison caricature as pabulum-spouting narcissist, but the song's ominous drift-- guided by Krieger's sinister riff and disrupted by Morrison's Oedipal intimations-- remains eerily compelling, and established the sex/death dichotomy that would play out in so many Doors songs. (Also: the song is actually shorter than you remembered: <em>The Doors</em> was originally mastered at a slightly slower speed, due to technical error that's been corrected by <em>Perception</em>'s new version-- so you'll get a few seconds of your life back.)<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
    Strange Days</em> (1967) closely adheres to the debut's winning formula: short songs about love and one long song about apocalypse (""When the Music's Over""). But 1968's <em>Waiting for the Sun</em> shows the first signs of fatigue, opening with the weakest of the Doors' hit singles (the Kinks-nicked ""Hello, I Love You""), and weighed down by start/stop multi-sectional three-minute songs (""Spanish Caravan"", ""The Unknown Solider"") that feel more meandering than the band's longest pieces. But it could've been worse: Among <em>Perception</em>'s featured outtakes is the 17-minute free-form tone poem ""The Celebration of the Lizard"", amusing as an anti-pop gesture from a top 40 act, but so portentous that, even at the height of their chemical ingestion, the band still thought it better to edit down its most coherent passage into the pulsating acid-rock throbber ""Not to Touch the Earth"".
    </p>
<p>
    History has relegated 1969's <em>The Soft Parade</em> to the same Spectacular Failure file as the Stones' <em>Their Satanic Majesties Request</em>; the problem, however, isn't the opulent TV talk-show orchestra arrangements (which lend ""Touch Me"" a schmaltzy charm) but the bloodless, Fat Elvis performances. A DVD performance clip of the title-track suite makes for a fitting summation of the Doors' half-hearted dalliance with symphonic psychedelia and their subsequent abandonment of it: John Densmore and Krieger look bored and embarrassed performing the song's poncey opening passages, before the game-saving swamp-funk finale allows a bloated, bearded Morrison to reconnect with his younger, more dynamic self.
    </p>
<p>
    Like so many of their peers, the Doors responded to the post-hippie hangover with a back-to-basics approach (read: the blues, man) that informed their last two albums, 1970's <em>Morrison Hotel</em> and 71's<em> L.A. Woman</em>-- though the significance of this move is overstated by <em>Perception</em>'s inclusion of eight (mostly incomplete) consecutive session takes of ""Roadhouse Blues"" that merely chart the song's evolution from sloppy bar-band jam to somewhat less sloppy bar-band jam (though the between-song banter is amusing). <em>L.A. Woman</em> is also marred by its share of blooze snoozes (""Crawling King Snake"") but finds the band effectively shaping up for the hard-rock 70s with the hypno-grooved title track and ""The Wasp (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)"", the most successful union of the band's bluesy tendencies and Morrison's beat-poet babble.  But even if his death was still months away, on ""Riders on the Storm"" Morrison has already turned into a ghost, lending the song an eternally haunted quality that even the band's detractors can't deny.
    </p>
<p>
    When Morrison first urged his fans to break on through, he wasn't asking for their money, he was asking for a commitment. At $120 and 12 discs, <em>Perception</em> is asking for both, but the audiophile end of the fanbase will be pleased by the new masters (as well as engineer Bruce Botnick's gearhead-oriented liner notes). In contrast to the multi-tracked splendor of much 60s psychedelic rock, the Doors made great use of space, a virtue highlighted by the new masters' foregrounding of the two most overlooked Doors: guitarist Krieger, whose finger-picked leads so often took a backseat to Manzarek's organ arpeggios; and drummer Densmore, whose playing hits harder the lighter his touch.
    </p>
<p>
    The band's prolific album output means <em>Perception</em> offers little in the way of essential leftovers, but that's more of a relief than anything. The lasting perception of <em>Perception</em>: Had the Doors' six albums been condensed to three-- cherry-picking the best material from <em>The Doors</em>/<em>Strange Days</em>, <em>Waiting for the Sun</em>/<em>The Soft Parade</em> and <em>Morrison Hotel</em>/<em>L.A. Woman</em>-- the band would've had a discography as airtight as Jimi Hendrix's. Instead, each ensuing album-- drawn from increasingly depleted sources of inspired material and an increasingly intoxicated frontman-- put greater stress on the band's internal contradictions: A proto-punk band with baroque-classical aspirations, fronted by a California-dreamy pop idol who really wanted to be a reclusive fat beardo poet in Paris-- a would-be idealist who made a more convincing nihilist.
    </p>
<p>
    The singer's decline is laid bare in <em>Perception</em>'s DVD clips: While an entrancing 1967 Canadian television performance of ""The End"" (incest rant excised) focuses on the young Morrison's face to the point of denying the other band members' existence, a grainy 1970 Australian live taping of ""Crawling King Snake"" seems to be deliberately avoiding his burly figure. By placing these images alongside the erratic artistic trajectory that plays out on <em>Perception</em>'s six discs, we see that Morrison was not just a victim of his own excess, but also an early victim of a burgeoning music-business machine that demanded quantity over quality, regardless of the personal or creative toll.

    Though it was one of the biggest music stories of 2006, here at the end of the calendar there's really nothing left to be said about the commercialization of indie.  We're all tapped out of our righteous indignation, our disgruntled cynicism, our territorial defense mechanisms. And just in time, too, since it seems like all the obvious symbols of indie's mainstreaming process are already beginning to fade: ""The O.C."" is experiencing plummeting ratings, Zach Braff vehicle <em>The Last Kiss</em> was in theaters for about five hours, major-label efforts from the Rapture and the Trail of Dead have kicked up barely more dust than their indie back catalog.  Really, it's not a surprise; after all, ""O.C.""-indie was just another fickle music-biz dalliance, and such flavors tend to have a pretty short lifespan.</p><p>
    The sixth installments of ""The O.C."" mixtape series has all the markings of a trend in its death throes, as this latest species of coffeeshop indie starts to eat itself.  It's a collection of 12 covers, performed by B- and C-list artists, with the subject matter mostly reflecting the narrow band of the recent and distant indie/alt-rock canon.  It's a sad, dreary collection, and not only because most of the groups bring a church-service level of enthusiasm to the proceedings; its forced nostalgia feels false and pointless, remembering the heady days of two years ago when ""Float On"" was a top 40 mainstream smash.<br/></p><p>
    That's right, ""Float On"" is the lead track on this tribute-act collection, as the nobodies of Goldspot imagine what the song might've sounded like had Modest Mouse <em>completely</em> cut loose the Isaac Brock barking and jagged edges of their old sound.  The result, of course, is thoroughly neutered, transforming Brock's desperate-sounding optimism into a school-assembly motivational speech.  As far as still-warm alternative chart hits go, ""California"" obviously has more of a right to inclusion, but Mates of State sound as if their performance of the theme song was conscripted, displaying none of the clashing harmonies and organ-fuzz enthusiasm of their own music.
    </p>
<p>
    The same rearrangement formula is repeated throughout the record, with most artists content to merely strip down the original, sing it a little prettier, and try to make it fit some sunset beachfront heartbreak montage scene.  This childproofing effect is most egregious when applied to material that was once raucous (like Rogue Wave's nearly unrecognizable debasement of ""Debaser"") or interesting for its excess (like the Coldplayed hack job John Paul White does on ELO's wonderfully lush ""Can't Get It Out of My Head"").  
    </p>
<p>
    A particularly astonishing misreading occurs with Pinback's slack-pop take on Black Flag's ""Wasted"", which naively plays the sarcastic lyrics straight, turning the mockery of the original (not to mention Camper Van Beethoven's hilarious version) into an ignorant stoner anthem.  One moment that promises to change the sunset-lull mood of the compilation is Lady Sovereign's ""Pretty Vacant"", but even this arrangement is disappointingly conservative, with blunt rock instrumentation and a lyric that doesn't befit the intelligence and playfulness of the petite rapper.  
    </p>
<p>
    As the compilation groans to a close, lesser-known source material rears its head, with songs from Super Furry Animals, Clinic, and the New Year all going under the knife.  Here, the lack of imagination crosses the line from yawningly rote to nearly unethical reproduction: Syd Matters' karaoke take on SFA's ""Hello Sunshine"" does little more than replace the original's glossy harmonies with a Rufus Wainwright imitation, the M's bite the entire <em>Castlevania</em> backdrop of Clinic's ""Come Into Our Room"" for their own cover.  Ostensibly the goal of such tributes is to draw people's attention to more obscure artists, but by changing nothing but the personnel, it's a thin line between celebrating your influences and pirating their sound.
    </p>
<p>
    Only two songs bother to make enough adjustments to be considered a lateral move, if not an improvement.  Ann Arbor's Tally Hall manage to retain the Killers' anthemic properties of ""Smile Like You Mean It"" while swapping out the keyboards for bizarre choral harmonies and theremin peaks, and Band of Horses enlarge The New Year's ""The End's Not Near"" by basically turning it into a reverb-soaked Band of Horses song.  But for the rest of the record, the uniform watering-down process is nothing less than a perfect indictment of indie's brief time in the mainstream spotlight.  
    </p>
<p>
    Television may have been the medium by which cult bands stormed the castle of pop culture, but it also doomed their efforts, as everyone-- consciously or otherwise-- sought to make music fit for promiscuous doctors and rich teenagers.  In record time, all the unique trappings that made indie's ascension a compelling story were stripped away to better fit the round hole of marketing necessity, and the story became nothing but the same old song and dance.

    A decade has passed since Belle &amp; Sebastian released their first two albums. More than enough time, anyway, for awkward American youths who came of age to <em>If You're Feeling Sinister</em> to put their own stamp on the bedsit melancholy of Stuart Murdoch and fey precursors like the Housemartins and the Smiths. Austin indie-poppers Voxtrot have been widely praised for doing just that, but professional droolerati have paid markedly less attention to talented young library-mopers from outside the convenient South by Southwest ZIP code. Math and Physics Club, for example.</p><p>
    The Seattle quintet's self-titled album should get some warm looks from a new generation of tender-hearted, bookish music listeners. Following a pair of solid (if by-the-book) 2005 EPs, <em>Weekends Away</em> and <em>Movie Ending Romance</em>, MAPC's full-length debut dusts off another 10 brazenly sweet songs of quiet heartbreak, late-summer acoustic guitar, reverb-laden Rickenbacker, tambourine, and occasional violin. ""We've been down this road before,"" bespectacled singer/guitarist Charles Bert croons softly on ""You'll Miss Me"", and it won't take twee kids long to play spot-the-influences. But, in the words of distinguished Australian forebears (and labelmates) the Lucksmiths: ""Once more won't hurt/ So let's do it once more.""</p><p>
    Indeed, like that underrated band Down Under, MAPC tend to obsess about the weather-- and not just in their breezy melodies. The ba-ba-ba chorus of ""April Showers"" is a fine excuse for staying indoors, while ""Cold as Minnesota"" confronts a selfish lover with a bitter frost beneath deceptively cheery handclaps: ""Stop wearing all my clothes and watching television/ I used to be your favorite show."" The happier times and languid strums of ""Holidays and Saturdays"" call for swimming pools, croquet, and all-night conversations, perhaps between Field Mice listening sessions. Bittersweet opener ""Darling, Please Come Home"" conjures sunsets and fireflies to save a troubled relationship: ""You said I seem like a stranger/ Well, I guess that makes two.""
    </p>
<p>
    At times, the songs come tantalizingly close to discovering themselves, though no one will mistake MAPC for Tullycraft anytime soon. ""La La La Lisa"", with requisite la-la-las, reminisces about a nervous punk-rock crush-- how ""there's just something about a girl with a bass guitar."" Meanwhile, the lonely protagonist of ""Such a Simple Plan"" wishes for a love instruction manual while ""typing away to another sad romantic on the internet."" Finale ""The Last Chance"" offers love one more chance to conquer all, or at least another human being (oh lawd, just one). It's this unfettered sentimentality that should set MAPC apart as big-tent indie races to crown the next Dishwalla. Drummer Kevin Emerson may have a surprising funk pedigree, but this is music to hold hands to.

Home-recorded on four-track in Sumpner's Sheffield kitchen, the lo-fi album existed for years as a demo kicking around Fat Cat's offices, the label temporarily unable to locate the music's author. A softly captivating work of gauzy folk and dreampop, the album benefited from the type of gradual, organic discovery that's virtually impossible to duplicate. Now firmly established on Fat Cat's roster, Songs of Green Pheasant's latest release, <em>Aerial Days</em>, initially appears to be a more ambitious production, with Sumpner doubling himself up from four to eight-track. Yet despite this enhanced fidelity, he manages to sustain his debut's deliberate sense of isolation, sounding every bit as temporally displaced even as he moves away from that album's folk-based syntax.</p><p>
    On his debut, Sumpner's use of acoustic guitars and pastoral Peak District imagery understandably caused him to get caught up in the ongoing neo-folk currents, and <em>Aerial Days</em> clearly still contains the barest echoes of Nick Drake or Simon &amp; Garfunkel. But here, Sumpner has evidently taken greater care to enrich his music's levels of dissolved oxygen, fortifying each of these tracks with acres of weightless guitar FX and reverb-drenched piano. Once again Sumpner has produced and performed nearly everything himself, and in doing so he firmly re-aligns Song of Green Pheasant's genealogy not amongst the folkies but instead within the ethereal, post-shoegaze lineage of such acts as Flying Saucer Attack or Piano Magic. It's a sphere in which Sumpner clearly feels most comfortable-- perhaps a bit <em>too</em> comfortable-- yet most often his translucent melodies and subtle arrangements prove sturdy enough to avoid their simply drifting off into the celestial twilight.</p><p>
    Like so many albums conceived in solitude, <em>Aerial Days</em> is best appreciated alone. The concentric reverberations of the opening ""Pink by White"" effectively mirror the song's whispers of memory and desire, a scarcely hidden undercurrent of guitar distortion coursing beneath in the still, autumnal darkness. This quiet undertow of dissonance crops up repeatedly throughout the album, as on ""Remembering and Forgetting"", when Sumpner's lush vocal harmonies are interrupted by the introduction of a detuned tack piano that chimes with the decrepit nagging of an antique grandfather clock. The album's lyrics are often too hushed and blurred to draw strict conclusions; rather, the impact is one of grainy disconnection, as though these songs are an attempt to recreate a specific scene through the buried language of dreams and half-remembered fragments.
    </p><p>
    This diffuse, spectral approach can lead Songs of Green Pheasant to vistas of astonishing beauty, particularly on ""Wolves Amongst Snowmen"", which gently opens out into a dazzling guitar panorama, or on the instrumental ""Brody Jacket"" which closes the album with a lyrical, yearning pulse of trumpet and submerged guitar. Unfortunately, though, <em>Aerial Days'</em> sense of disconnect also extends to the album's structure itself, often leaving these songs to appear as orphans rather than as a cohesive whole. This effect is especially apparent on the album's cover of ""Dear Prudence"", originally recorded for a John Lennon tribute on Radio One, that goes precisely as far as you'd expect it to and no further. At heart, perhaps, this is the track that best illustrates the challenges that now face Songs of Green Pheasant, as Sumpner is forced to balance his music's enrapturing seclusion with the need to eventually move his work beyond its familiar comfort zone.

But <em>Sangue Puro</em> offers no such respites: It's as claustrophobic as the
    cave evoked by its bat motif artwork. Scraps of dentist-drill synths, telegraphic
    bass, and ceremonial drumwork reiterate themselves with
    maddening regularity, their jagged barbs strung out in violently
    hypnotic patterns. The title track is particularly itchy-- it
    has the satisfying quality of a manual
    typewriter carriage sliding home, its ravaged 8-bit squelch and lunging
    drums simulating pass after pass over the same irritated area.</p><p>
    This transition from off-kilter dancepunk to something more droning and
    difficult to classify smacks of Liars' artistic arc, but there are
    important distinctions: Les Georges started off weirder but have wound
    up more intelligible, and while Liars' drone epic <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>
    contains open, shimmering spaces where one can catch a breath, <em>Sangue Puro</em> hunkers down in close, dark regions, so the resultant
    transportation is more nauseous than euphoric. Seemingly endless loops
    sear themselves into your brain-- the decaying synth jitter that slices
    through the nervous drums and flighty electronic squiggles of ""Skulls
    in the Closet"", the baggy bass wheeze of ""Scissorhands"", the antic
    Saturday-morning cartoon theme that bleats unrelentingly through
    ""Mammal Beats"".</p><p>
    For art-rockers, Les Georges are great at making music that's at once
    weird and humble. The absurd club track ""Sleek Answer"", complete with
    awkward raps from Poney P, proves that they haven't lost their sense of
    humor amid this otherwise serious and panicky album. Elsewhere, her
    incantatory vocals only draw the noose tighter, as on ""Mange Avec Tes
    Doigts"", where she squeaks unintelligibly over acid-bathed surf rock. 'Singing' is a pretty abstract concept on a Les Georges album; it
    involves just using your voice in some deranged way, and by the time ""Lonely
    Lonely"" rolls around, it's de-evolved to infantile grunting.
    </p><p>
    This sort of
    de-evolution is what Les Georges is all about; <em>Sangue Puro</em>
    is at once intriguing and frustrating because it never breaks through
    the top, or bottoms out on the evolutionary range. In fact, we don't even get to
    <em>see</em> the range; the music is perpetually stuck in one knuckle-dragging,
    slime-trailing state. It'd be nice if it occasionally rose to
    its feet, or dropped down to crawl on its belly like a snake, but with Les
    Georges Leningrad, you take what you get-- if you can take it.

The concept tends to be most enlightening when it comes to acts that make electronic music, and not just because they're presumed to be better music scholars. The truth is that we tend to talk about electronic acts in relation to <i>other</i> electronic acts-- the ones on the same labels, the ones that use the same tools and techniques, the same synths and software. With the right mix, musicians like these can try to place themselves within a much larger tradition of <i>songwriting</i>, and spell out what it is they'd be interested in whether they were writing for digital keyboards or chamber quartets.</p>
<p>This installment of the <i>LateNightTales</i> series pairs up with Jean-Benoît Dunckel's solo project as the total fall publicity for Air. It's also one of the best of this type of mix I've heard in a while. For one thing, Air have taken the ""Late Night"" part of the title <i>very</i> seriously, making for an incredibly functional, utilitarian mix. Only a very few tracks here have anything approaching a conventional drum kit, and a good portion of the set consists of moody film-score work and orchestral pieces: These songs are matched up on their slow movement and their spare, deliberate sound. The result is uniformly pensive and weighty, painted in deep, dark colors-- a mix for the deadest hours of night.</p>
<p>And since Air have always been pop songwriters more than any kind of ""electronic"" act, they manage to offer a terrific picture of the music that informs their own recordings. The most colorful track here is Minnie Ripperton's still-gorgeous ""Lovin' You"", a track whose twinkling 70s keys are an obvious antecedent to Air's <i>Moon Safari</i>. (They also sound so pure and natural that it's hard to remember why that album had to give them the occasional ironic wink.) There are also plenty of examples of the kind of very-grave, very-French baritone drama that clearly informs the group's later albums. The way Japan's ""Ghosts"" suspends David Sylvian's voice over an abyss, with only the odd keyboard accent to keep it company; the way Scott Walker and Lee Hazlewood rumble their way through deep reverb over plush arrangements-- what else would you expect Air to be listening to?</p>
<p>The band's choices here turn out to be consistently interesting, too, and should prove worthwhile even to someone who already digs through this kind of stuff on her own. Sofia Coppola might have beat them to anthologizing the Cure's ""All Cats Are Grey"", and a Cat Power chestnut in the middle kind of breaks the spell, but the majority of the picks are damned clever. Jeff Alexander's ""Come Wander With Me"" seems like it should be some vintage English or Greenwich-Village folk, until you look it up and find out it was composed for an episode of <i>The Twilight Zone</i>. There's some of the sedate, flanged-out psychedelic music people forget Black Sabbath tended to make. The folky second half skips from a Robert Wyatt lullaby to Elliott Smith to the Troggs' whispery ""Cousin Jane""-- something like the Stones' ""I Am Waiting"" if it never got around to the rock part. There's a string piece from the Chinese composer Tan Dun, a bit of Nino Rota, a suddenly sunny break from Sébastien Tellier, and-- for the closer-- the Cleveland Orchestra playing Ravel.</p>
<p>Which means this disc is surprising, satisfying, and most of all very, very functional. The trouble with most home-listening mixes, here in the Age of the Playlist, is that you could quite easily throw together a bunch of songs you liked on your own. Air are smart enough to specialize-- to do a mix for an exact mood, an exact time of night, the kind of deep and deliberate music that sounds right when everything else seems too loud, too much. You could try to piece something similar together from your mp3 collection, but I'm guessing it wouldn't be half as good-- and besides, you'd have already heard it all.</p></div>"|9678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9678-latenighttales/|7.8|Nitsuh Abebe

<p>That desire to transcend the mundane drives lots of art, but despite that they've been making music for     the better part of the decade, it didn't really crystallize for The Knife until     earlier this year.

<p>Not surprisingly, the relative success of <i>Silent Shout</i> has paved the way for a     re-examination of the band's first two albums.

<p>Stacked side-by-side-by-side, the Knife's discography is     pretty much a textbook example of increasing returns, which means 2001's <i>The Knife</i> is the weakest link in the chain.

Nonetheless, between Dreijer's     voice (a thing of strange beauty, even in untouched form), the mutated vocals     in ""A Lung"", and the gently percolating synths of opener ""Neon"", there are     plenty of moments to suggest the Knife's future greatness.</p>
<p>Brandishing a bona fide calling card single (the superb     ""Heartbeats""), a toothier production approach, and an increasing debt to house     music, 2004's <i>Deep Cuts</i> marked a     double-step forward for the duo. If <i>The     Knife</i> suffered from seeming a little too tentative and domesticized, <i>Deep Cuts</i> came across as brash and     untamed, a streamroller that left overturned chunks of everything from steel     drums (""Pass This On"") and marimbas (""Rock Classics"") to hi-NRG  (""Listen Now"") and slinky, Timbaland-inspired r&amp;b (""You Make Me Like Charity"") in its path. It wasn't always pretty, but     the highs-- ""Heartbeats"", ""One For You"", ""She's Having a Baby"", ""You Take My Breath Away""-- were more rewarding, and the sense of drama noticeably heightened.</p>

This isn't Brakes only resemblance to the critical darlings of nü-classic rock; they have roughly the same relationship to the Ramones that the Hold Steady has to the Boss, or, for that matter, Art Brut to the Fall. All these bands update their icons with an irreverent indie rock flavor, highly conceptual lyrics, and, in brakesbrakesbrakes' case, accents of Southern rock. On <em>The Beatific Visions</em>, they're also more like the Pixies than ever before, having made a more ""serious"" album than their debut, <em>Give Blood</em>,<em> </em>while retaining their off-kilter aura.</p><p>
<em>Give Blood </em>was as fun as this superior effort, but also a little shtickier. Here, the shtick-- lively jangles infused with a punk leer and Eamon Hamilton's phlegm-laced rants-- has crystallized into a more realized, brighter gleam. Gone are the gimmicky fragments and Mcluskyesque scene-jabs. <em>The Beatific Visions </em>is dominated by direly catchy and fully fleshed-out songs that pop like punk, lilt like country, mutter politics, and reek of the garage: ""Hold Me in the River"" crashes along on an ornery, feel-good choogle; the twangy licks on ""On Your Side"" are so slippery that it sounds like guitarist Thomas White had chicken grease on his fingers. These are balanced out with tender ballads that don't sacrifice Brakesbrakesbrakes' dark, ridiculous wit, like the baggy trail-song ""If I Should Die Tonight"" (""tell her that I love her,"" Hamilton croons with fleeting sweetness, ""or she might never know,""), the light-as-the-Shins ballad ""Isabel"", and standout track ""No Return"", a serene, blossoming hum that brings the album to an moving close.</p><p>
    We know that Hamilton is into literature from his Dostoevsky-rhapsodizing days in British Sea Power; here, there's a whiff of Bulgakov in ""Margarita"", and the specter of Barthelme looms with portentous absurdity above the whole affair. This is especially evident on ""Porcupine or Pineapple"": Hamilton hawks up the titular refrain like a loogie, then transforms the non-sequitur into a potent metaphor for intractability as the garage punk clatter starts to really stomp: ""Who won the war/ Was it worth fighting for?"" This is a wartime record with a heavy political dimension, but brakesbrakesbrakes prefer to couch their dissent in raucous tones of Pynchonian dread, seldom proselytizing: ""It's clear it's the fear keeps us under control"" Hamilton keens convincingly on ""Margarita"". And on Chubby Checker send-up ""Spring Chicken"", he jitters, ""Come on over, do the terrorist/ It makes me so nervous when you're moving like this.""
    </p><p>
    On this same song, Hamilton repeatedly invites us to do the ""spring chicken""-- yep, it's a song-accompanied-by-a-dance, in the recent tradition of so many hopeful rap stars. Brakesbrakesbrakes also put their unique spin on another hypermodern trend, the mobile-communications-technology song (see also Da Musicianz's ""Camera Phone"" and James Figurine's ""55566688833""). ""Mobile communications let me down again,"" Hamilton sings to a bad connection on this melting slow-burner. Brakesbrakesbrakes straddle the silly-serious fault line without slipping; Hamilton's more refined vocal style-- rambunctious, squalling, charismatic and tuneful-- is a terrific conduit for such vibrantly contrasting content. If the pre-apocalyptic fear is omnipresent, so is the reckless abandon. <em>The Beatific Visions</em> is the shimmy at the end of the world, wide-eyed and wild as it should be.

    Bad Brains' <em>Live at CBGB 1982</em> is the audio counterpart to
    the recently released DVD of the same name, a sight to behold: The Bad
    Brains at the height of their power, HR shaking hands in the crowd,
    dancing like a madman, seething and stalking the stage. In the crowd
    are black folks and white; women and men; old and young; Rasta and otherwise. Vintage CBGB, vintage Bad Brains.</p><p>
    The audience for this kind of creaking document is clear: Those who
    wish they'd been there, those who were and want to look back, and those
    who just really, really love the Bad Brains. There are those of us who
    always wanted to believe there was something <em>different</em>
    about this band, that every show they played was like an army marching
    to war; that they really did play that fast; that there was so little
    quit in their sound you could believe the four of them were
    invincible. And the recording bares witness in spite of (or because of) a
    soundboard that is, as befits a raging punk rock show, barely
    functional. Drums are no better than banging on a desk; the bass sounds
    like the lower half is missing; vocals are barely pronounced, let alone
    pronounced into a microphone.</p><p>
    Some contest that Bad Brains were a hardcore band first and a
    second-rate reggae outfit second; with this release, those people may be in for a surprise. By
    1982 the band had already become a full-fledged split personality,
    equal parts dub-reggae and searing punk rock, and the two sit aside one
    another with neither explanation nor any real effort to mitigate the
    shock of the switch. On the DVD, you see the crowd take the band's two
    heads in stride, but it's jarring. Robert Christgau wrote in the <em>Village Voice</em>
    in 1986, that, ""As a reggae band, they were a hardcore band with a
    change-up,"" but that's understating it: Maybe a hardcore band with an
    eephus pitch?
    </p>
<p>
    Check out this site's own
    archives and you'll find this gem, which says it well: ""By the time
    they released their artistic milestone, <em>I Against I</em>, and reggae
    influences had spread deeper and deeper into their sound, the Bad
    Brains had already forgotten more about hardcore than most of their
    successors would ever learn."" <em>Live At CBGB 1982</em> comes at the
    dead center turning of the tide, nearly equidistant between the
    masterpiece hardcore of their debut tape and the nearly full-on reggae
    of their most accomplished effort in that genre, 1986's <em>I Against I</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    The criminally under-compiled ""Supertouch"" appears here, three years
    after being left off their most recent best of; there's no ""Pay to
    Cum"", but ""Banned in DC"" and ""Big Takeover"" fill that gap. ""I And I
    Survive"", ""Jah the Conqueror"", and ""Joshua's Song"" step in as Bad
    Brains dub-reggae at its most evocative. In 1982, HR, their mercurial
    lyricist, was still looked upon as a prophet and near god, and his
    proclamations of ""Real unity-not just talk about unity"" get at the
    reason why. 
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, those lines are also colored by the band's now known future,
    in which misogyny and alleged-homophobia, demons that dogged HR through
    clashes with gay hardcore bands, prison officials, and even the Beastie
    Boys, loom large. Soon ""real unity"" would be replaced by more esoteric
    loyalties; peeks at the past are complicated this way. These are not
    particularly intelligible versions of these songs, nor are they very
    well recorded. So what we're left with is the raw, screaming moment.
    And that, for all its discomfort, is best left for the many who would,

    For his entry in Western Vinyl's ""Portrait Series"", Robert Lippok
    of To Rococo Rot chose to focus his creative energy on the robot, a subject
    long an object of fascination to electronic musicians. Western culture's
    collective unconscious fixes the robot's natural historical backdrop somewhere
    between 1920, when Czech writer Karel Čapek coined the term in his play <em>R.U.R.</em>,
    and the 1950s, when the beginning of the space age made a future cohabiting
    with robots seem like an inevitability. So robot-themed electronic works from
    the likes jof Kraftwerk to Jeff Mills have always have a nostalgic,
    days-of-future-past sense about them.</p><p>
    Lippok follows course in this respect to a degree, generally foregoing
    recent advances in software and processing power and working instead with
    simple electronics to create a record that could have been created any time in
    the last dozen years. The subtlety and restraint he brings to the music are in
    line with his work on his main project; dynamic range is limited, small shifts
    in mood do the bulk of the work. ""Unexpected Behavior, No. 7"", after
    two short warm-ups, nicely demonstrates the upside of the approach, its spooky,
    pulsating synth and insistent high-hat working together with a squelching
    analog synth to create a palpable sense of tension. </p><p>
    Unfortunately, ""Unexpected Behavior, No. 7"" aside, the most
    engaging pieces here are the fragments that serve as interludes. ""To The
    Zero Movement Point"" and ""Closed Loop 3"" threaten violence with
    electronic scrapes moving randomly ominous synth drones, and ""Silent
    Movement (No Servo)"", though locked into a place Terry Riley moved away
    from 35 years ago after ""Persian Surgery Dervishes"", ably evokes the
    wonder of the early electronic era. But then there's four-minute tracks
    ""After Work"" and ""Pick and Place"", two plodding mid-tempo
    pieces that fit too easily with the forgettable portions of the TRR oeuvre. 
    </p>
    It's
    hard not to wish that the object of inspiration, the robot, had a clearer
    relationship to the music. It's got some pleasingly retro tendencies and a
    sharp cover, but <em>Robot</em> is out of time in an unexpected way, bringing to
    mind late-90s IDM at its blandest and least offensive.</div>"|9629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9629-robot/|4.9|Mark Richardson

    While reading a recent <em>Blender</em> article on the Killers, I was
    suddenly hit with a wave of bittersweet nostalgia. In the piece, Brandon Flowers
    espouses his rock star ideals. ""You want to see a god onstage,"" said the singer. ""You
    want to see something larger than life and unattainable. I was like, 'I could
    do that.'"" Thing is, he can't<em> </em>do that. <em>At all</em>. But Oasis most certainly
    could and did in their mid-90s heyday. And most of this contract-fulfilling
    2xCD best-of reinforces the Manchester-bred group's best qualities:
    brashness, swagger, and melodies for miles.</p><p>
    The compilation also upholds the sad-but-true notion that the
    Gallaghers &amp; Co. haven't come up with a great tune
    in nearly a decade. In their wake have been plenty of pretenders repolishing
    classic rock gems for a new century (Jet, Wolfmother, Kings of Leon), but none
    can match Noel's keen ear or Liam's indelible bleat. And whereas Flowers'
    arrogance is empty and halfhearted, Oasis's bravado sounded like
    gospel to this suburban teen reading imported Brit mags on a Barnes &amp; Noble
    bench. And, most important, they had a plethora of era-defining songs to back up much of their hot air.</p><p>
<em>Stop the Clocks</em> largely proves what fans already
    know: Oasis were at their best when they were coming up from the bottom. Their 1994-95 ascendancy fittingly provides the retrospective
    with nearly 80% of its material. Both <em>Definitely Maybe</em> and <em>(What's the
    Story) Morning Glory?</em> are represented with five tracks a piece, while four B-sides from the era also appear. Though classics like ""Rock 'N' Roll
    Star"" and ""Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol"" have come to represent
    clichéd ideas of stardom and its vices, those songs were originally written
    from the outside looking in. Liam is given triumphant lines
    based on figments rather than reality: ""In my mind my dreams are
    real,"" he snarls, willing his hopes toward actuality over the band's spiky Led Zeppelin crunch. 
    </p>
<p>
    Fearless optimism reins on the group's best-ever track,
    ""Live Forever"", a quasi-reaction to the nihilism of grunge. Talking
    about the song in an excellent ""this is your life""-style 40-minute
    interview included on <em>Stop the Clocks</em>' deluxe edition DVD,
    Noel dismisses some of Kurt Cobain's heroin-laced diatribes  while backing up the careful hope of his signature track: ""That was a guy that had everything and was
    miserable.
    We had
    fuck all and I still thought getting up in the morning was the greatest
    fuckin' thing ever 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night.""
    Such escapism and idealist wonder found blissful haven inside Oasis's finest tracks.
    ""I dream of you-- and all the things you say/ I wonder where you are
    now?"" sings Liam on the blustery distortion ballad ""Slide Away"",
    once again reiterating the band's romanticism. 
    </p>
<p>
    Aside from the inclusion of obviously lesser post-1996
    tracks-- which stick out clumsily amidst the undisputed greats-- and the minor
    squabbles that are sure to arise over which B-sides Noel left out, the collection's most controversial point has to be the
    exclusion of anything from the group's coke-fueled third album, <em>Be Here Now</em>. While
    that infamously excessive LP was a clear step down from previous heights, it's also more ambitious and tuneful than any album they've
    released since. Tracks like the crushing, murky epic ""D'You Know What I
    Mean"", swelling heartbreaker ""Don't Go Away"" or underrated burner ""I Hope, I Think, I Know"" blow away <em>Stop the Clocks</em>
    skippables like ""Lyla"" and ""Go Let It Out"". (And to Noel's credit, there are no new songs included as shameless sales-boosters.) 
    </p>
    In the DVD interview, Noel recounts how Creation
    Records founder Alan McGee didn't want to put ""The Masterplan"" out as
    a B-side in 1995 because it was ""too good."" ""I don't write shit
    songs,"" Noel remembers saying, before he checks himself: ""Fast
    forward about three years, and I'm fucking, 'Can we put 'Masterplan' out as a
    single?'."" After their initial astonishing run of hits, Oasis reached their bacchanalian rock nirvana and had no idea what to do next. Instead of exploring new sounds and styles like their
    Fab Four heroes once did, the group fell into a repetitive AC/DC rut by trying
    to recreate past glories without the striving drive that originally gave them
    life. Oasis only made two essential albums, so while its song selection is generally
    wise, this double-disc rewind is totally unnecessary for both casual fans
    and die-hards alike. But, for a fading, much loved band, it's also a necessary evil. At least Liam has a sense of
    humor about it-- in the accompanying video chat, he jokes, ""Hopefully
    we'll be able to do another one and really fucking milk it.""

    After several years of major-label maneuvering that led to a
    stalling career, Robyn bought out her contract, formed her own label, and
    released a mighty re-breakthrough in 2005. Since then, she hasn't slowed down
    much. This year she's scored two big collaborations-- ""Dream On""
    (with Christian Falk and Ola Salo) and ""With Every Heartbeat"" (with Kleerup)-- and
    now releases <em>The Rakamonie EP</em>,
    an assortment of oddball experiments, covers, and alternate takes. Each of
    these five tracks has been available in some form or another for a while, but they still sound fresh and revelatory.</p><p>
    Of the tracks off Robyn's self-titled 2005 album,
    ""Konichiwa Bitches""-- with its Spike Jones production antics and her old-school
    flow-- has the most potential to sound dated. But kicking off <em>Rakamonie</em>,
    that beat still sizzles, effectively negating the last Beck album, and Robyn's
    flygirl attitude remains undiluted even in the wake of Lady Sov's rise and
    plateau. While the song doesn't hint at Robyn's vocal range, it does showcase
    her hip-hop sensibilities and handily illustrates the zeal she takes in making
    music. That creative energy courses through every song on this EP (which, sadly, isn't likely to see release on this side of the Atlantic).<br/></p><p>
<em>Rakamonie</em> is a
    catchall for sure, but it magnifies the confidence of ""Konichiwa Bitches"" and showcases
    new facets of the persona she introduced on <em>Robyn</em>.
    On her cover of Teddybears' ""Cobrastyle"", she playfully turns Mad Cobra's
    Jamaican patois into a dance nursery rhyme, singing lines like ""My style is di
    bom digi bom di deng di deng digigi"" to boast about her <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    Even better are the pair of piano-led covers of
    Saul Williams' ""List of Demands"" and Prince's ""Jack U Off"". The former,
    recorded live with fellow Swede Jenny Wilson for Swedish music channel Musikbyrån, has an infectious pajama-party
    exuberance that barely disguises the boiling anger beneath the lyrics: The
    singers immediately establish a buzzy chemistry as they half-rap about playing
    broom-guitar and jumping on the bed, but they communicate the gravity of
    Williams' lyrics nonetheless. ""Jack U Off"", meanwhile, features Robyn accompanied only by
    barrelhouse piano (played by Björn Yttling of compatriots Peter Bjorn and John), creating an odd setting for such brashly
    stated sexual ministrations. Still, she takes obvious glee in the song's
    brattiness and, like Prince, recognizes the comedic absurdity of the single entendre.
    Also like Prince, Robyn manages to make it equally funny and sexy, which is no small
    feat.
    </p>
<p>
    Conversely, on the ballad version of ""Be Mine"", which is
    slowed to a stately tempo and stripped of its beat, Robyn reveals the
    expressiveness of her voice, its power and restraint. While it doesn't possess
    the devastating impact of the original, whose pop accoutrements magnified her
    heartbreak, this new interpretation not only shows how strong a songwriter Teddybears' Klas
    Åhlund is, but what a controlled and expressive vocalist Robyn
    is. Eschewing the trilling theatrics favored by so many young female singers,
    Robyn conveys depths of desperation in her restraint, singing straightforwardly
    but dramatically.
    </p>
<p>
    Robyn's popularity, limited as it is stateside, is based on her
    ability to inhabit a song with confidence and intuition, singing the hell out
    of it but never sounding showy or affected. Robyn keeps herself tethered to
    real life. When she halts ""Be Mine"" for a girl-group-style spoken-word bridge,
    she brings the song back to earth, playing up the heart-wrenching banality of
    crying in the rain and watching your ex tie someone else's shoelaces. It works
    so well-- on this version, but especially on the original-- because the passage anchors
    overwhelming pop emotions in the everyday. This is Robyn's strength as an
    artist, and maybe it's the key to her appeal: Her
    musical vocabulary covers girl groups, dance beats, pop hooks, and hip-hop
    jumprope rhythms, but she imbues these common elements with true soul.

But <em>Songs for the Gentle</em>, My My's first album, isn't your average Berlin banger. One of the subtlest and most richly rewarding electronic long-players of the year, it's the kind of album that could, if given the right push, snare at least a portion of the elusive crossover market. Now, My My aren't their labelmate Isolée, and <em>Songs</em> isn't <em>We Are Monster</em>-- it's a great album, but not quite as great as Isolée's unlikely breakout record from 2005. (My My's record also doesn't have quite the same disco quotient as Isolée's, which means they won't get the same automatic boost among Italo- and beardo-infatuated hipsters, but hey: That's the hipsters' loss.)</p><p>
    For a while, it seemed like the Berlin trio didn't really have anything as specific as a style; My My’s first few 12” singles veered from sleekly bombastic rave-ups like ""Serpentine"" to the toy-piano house of ""Swiss on Rye"" to the underwater melancholy of ""Butterflys &amp; Zebras"", a recent track for London's Aus label that could easily be mistaken for a release on sensitive trance labels like Border Community or Connaisseur. This lack of a unified voice makes a kind of sense, though, given that many of My My's tracks are written and produced principally by its individual members (Nick Höppner, who has a couple of tracks on Hamburg's Liebe*Detail label; the former nu-jazzer also known as Hefner, Lee Jones; and Dubplates &amp; Mastering tech Carsten Klemann). The band's list of influences on its <u><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/justmymy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MySpace page</a></u> also goes some way towards clarifying the stylistic drift, encompassing not only obvious touchstones like Herbert and Carl Craig but also Elton John, the Sea and Cake, Dinosaur Jr. and most tellingly, Sir John Peel.</p><p>
<em>Songs</em> finds the trio easing into its own sound not so much by resolving earlier contradictions but increasingly navigating the spaces between them. Track after track, the album counterposes sounds that at first seem to have no relation to each other, but after a listen or two, couldn't be imagined in another way. Clearly influenced by the sampling techniques of Herbert and Akufen, My My diverge from many of their German peers by forsaking the clean, machine-driven sound of so much current minimalism in favor of more substantive tone bursts and textures. While working consistently with the standard template underpinning so many forms of house (deep, minimal, electro-), they cleverly cloak it with a surprising, at times bewildering, array of sounds. Listening to one of their tracks unroll is a bit like watching a procession of clowns spill out of a Volkswagen, prompting the listener to wonder just how they squeezed so much stuff into a form so compact. Their song-like tracks (or track-like songs?) are at once lumbering and delicate, unwieldy, and pointillistic.
    </p><p>
    Much of this unsteady feel is due to My My's counterintuitive approach to drum sampling, pulling together hits with drastically different reverbs and room tones-- so, for instance, a medium-sized snare, with its attendant long decay, might rub shoulders with hi-hats so dry they could have been recorded in an anechoic chamber. Instead of sounding awkward, though, the tactic opens up the sonic equivalent of a non-Euclidean space, a shifting field of relative flux.
    </p>
<p>
    Where <em>We Are Monster</em> often felt like a deep-tissue massage so fierce it had the potential to alter the placement of house music's very anatomy, <em>Songs</em> offers a more cosmetic approach, dressing up an oft-cloned body in subtly outrageous shades. There are spongy acid bass lines, errant squeals like the FX on a toy spaceship, synthetic flutes, cash register bells; there are glockenspiels, trumpets, demure guitar licks, harps, rampant bleeps, untrimmed cymbals and resonant organs. (Improbably, they all place nicely together, a testament to the band's very fine ears.) Listeners familiar with Jones' Hefner work will be unsurprised at the soulful touch he brings to keyboard melodies and jazzy, augmented harmonies, turning clever assemblages into something far more expressive.
    </p>
<p>
    The sense of soul comes, too, from the vocal samples in songs like ""Clean Break"", ""The Secret Life of Pants"", and ""Got It""-- some of them slowing in mid-syllable like records being hand-braked. Oddly, there are far fewer vocals than you'd think; on a song like ""Eleventh Hour"" a single, distant coo is enough to lend the whole track the illusion of human presence. Or maybe it's the sense of breath that gives the record the illusion of humanity: Chords heave like a screen door swinging shut, and bleating horn sounds open and close like a bellows. But it's precisely these moments of inspired, imaginative, and occasionally counterintuitive sound design that makes <em>Songs</em> such a thrilling listen-- and makes My My's gentle hand so unexpectedly commanding.<br/></p></div>"|9670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9670-songs-for-the-gentle/|8.3|Philip Sherburne

    Standard logic holds that punks hate hippies and hippies
    don't get punks. But the differences have often been tenuous, and-- in a year
    when<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""></span><span> Sonic Youth could have conceivably hung backstage with
    moe. after their respective Bonnaroo sets-- the argument seems to be as
    superficial as a preference for patches. After all, in the end, isn't it all
    about fucking the man and making the world better for hanging out?</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The USA Is a Monster-- the Brooklyn duo of
    multi-instrumentalists Colin Langenus and Thom Hohman-- are the dudes most
    daringly dancing over the spliff-thin line between bordering subcultures, the
    bros most brazen with their veggie burritos and schizophrenic record
    collections. They're Akron/Family with different screws loose and altered mores
    in the foreground: Like Crosby, Suzuki, Rollins &amp; Young in halves, they
    roar in confrontational salvos before drifting into pastoral hums, those bents
    occasionally merging in the form of technical but jarring prog-and-psyche
    excursions. Sonic vacillation aside, The USA's dual curse-the-present,
    idealize-the-future memes dovetail with such hybridization. Over three
    full-length albums, The USA Is a Monster have gone punk on the politicos and
    their predecessors while honoring the hopeful future they project-- all in an
    espoused mutual love for both poles of Black Flag and young Grateful Dead.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The duo's third Load Records LP, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Sunset at the End of the
    Industrial Age</span><span>, is the fullest realization
    of that bridged aesthetic-- yet, anyway. As punks, they're indignant and
    informed: On the rhythmically staggered guitar-and-drum opener ""The Greatest
    Mystery"", Hohman (sounding a bit like Trey Anastasio) opines, ""You build your
    wealth upon things you own."" It's a mantra with precedents from Ghandi to Bad
    Religion, but here it comes with evidentiary namechecks: Hohman demands a new
    familiarity with Native American scholars Ward Churchill and Vine Deloria and
    references failures of institutional social Darwinism. But the subsequent
    line-- ""If the power grid suddenly fell apart, could you walk a new road with an
    open heart?""-- begs from hippy rhetoric. Talk about rivers, rainbows and an
    idyllic future does much the same. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Likewise, the 13-minute title track moves slowly through
    six phases, opening with a marimba and synthesizer drone before pounding into
    tumultuous thrash, like drums rattling inside of a blender. In unison they
    belt: ""And when the sun sets/ And the Western powers fade/ The lights go out
    [first political, now visionary…] and the stars will be so clear/ A naked land
    deforested/ A white blanket of snow."" It sidesteps into a halcyon acoustic
    melody, industry's engine stopping and snow melting in a moment suitable for
    the eyes of the world. The clash returns, but, in time, the tonic battles it
    back, an infinite, self-sustaining conclusion manifested for a text-painting
    triumph.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Polar tracks like this, though, set up impossibly difficult
    notions: <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Sunset</span><span> is rife with the sense
    that The USA hasn't yet reached its on-album potential. ""It's a Beautiful Thing
    (I Like My Oranges Peeled For Me)"" awkwardly ricochets between shifty math and
    a spoken-word, synthesizer-and-drum midsection about urban debauchery, largesse
    and lethargy, while the 46-second ""Wine Country Cracker Blues"" does the same
    with barely comprehensible talk about white cancer, white crack and white AIDS.
    The tailing ""How We Are Livin' (It's Not the Scripture, It's the Mass)"" gets jangly, quiet, domineering and, ultimately,
    only frustrating. Live, such bursts and transitions from vehemence to
    vision-- musically illustrated with fury and finesse-- work to USA's advantage.
    But, sustained over a pointed album directed for an audience's self-awareness,
    it's as taxing as it is teasing, setting up ideas just to sell them short for
    less provocative bookends. It's like an impassioned hippy and a haranguing punk
    simultaneously speaking on capitalism, saying the same things with different
    tones and ends: There's plenty worthy of action, but-- by diatribe's end-- no one
    knows what's happening, anyway.</span>

    The fourth long-player by Portland, Ore.,
    indie-folk group Norfolk &amp; Western begins and ends with the sound of a
    rickety projector whirring through film, a cue that we're supposed to hear these
    songs in cinematic terms. Instead of Mercury Rev-style orchestral
    swells or the theatrical productions staged by the
    Decemberists, <em>The Unsung Colony</em>
    contains intimate scenes writ in miniature, small moments occasionally building
    up to big emotions or simply fading away. Continuing in the direction they took
    on last year's <em>Gilded Age</em> EP, Norfolk
    &amp; Western's concerns remain atmospheric rather than sweepingly emotional or
    grandly narrative, and these songs are meant to evoke a time long in the past,
    when a loud projector would have been accompanied by a gramophone (like the one
    the band takes on tour) or a pianist.</p><p>
    For the most part, this tack works very well for Norfolk
    &amp; Western, which originally began as a solo project by singer/songwriter
    Adam Selzer. However, in adding a fuller band with a more permanent lineup,
    the music has grown statelier, more ambitious, and more agile. The current lineup
    may be the best yet, cradling Selzer's songs in lush, dusty
    instrumentation, but his most formidable foil is former Decemberist Rachel
    Blumberg, whose rock drums propel the songs out of their backward-looking
    slouch and whose angelic, wordless vocals counter Selzer's on ""Barrels on
    Fire"". ""The New Rise of Labor"" bustles along on a tripping beat, its mix of
    instruments-- including piano, marimba, ukulele, banjo, and electric
    guitar-- creating a shuffling rhythm that mutates into boisterous noise before
    subsiding into ""Rehearsing La Dolce Vita"". The album's best songs immediately
    follow that introductory projector, retaining its acetone flicker: ""The
    Longest Stare"", a compact pop track that builds dramatically to an abrupt end,
    and ""The Shortest Stare"", whose jazzy guitar work complements the album's
    strongest melody.</p><p>
<em>The Unsung Colony</em>
    can be a little awkward at times, as if the film has slipped the reel. The band
    has mastered a rise-and-fall dynamic that's common among indie bands (like Death
    Cab for Cutie), but don't do anything new or exceptional with it. When they
    settle into out-of-time pastoral pop on ""How to Reel in"" and ""Drifter"", their
    low-key instrumentation, subdued melodies, and Selzer's hushed vocals draw
    obvious comparisons to Mojave 3, albeit with more concrete lyrics. And, if <em>The Unsung Colony </em>really were a movie,
    you might be tempted to walk out before the end. The second side fails to
    develop the threads established by the first: The performances lose dimension,
    songs drag on too long and cause the scenes to lose their natural rhythm, and
    the audience grows restless as it bears indulgences like the old-timey
    instrumental ""Atget Waltz"" and the choppy ""Banish All Rock"". Despite its
    insistent horn fanfares, the seven-minute would-be epic ""Arrangements Made""
    goes on and on but never arrives anywhere.
    </p>
<p>
    ""From the Interests of Few"" attempts
    to compare current political predicaments to those of 1968, but the contemporary touches
    sound a little out of place on an album that's so immersed in the distant past.
    Still, that song does make a certain kind of sense: The album sounds like it's
    intended to be the band's big statement, with a sweeping scope and songs that
    tell stories of the gold rush, the circus, teen runaways, and drifters. But Norfolk &amp; Western don't draw clear metaphorical or musical connections between now and
    then, undershooting their thematic aim considerably. <em>The Unsung Colony</em> doesn't appear to be the climax of the band's
    career, just more rising action.

But a snippet fits very     nicely in the third position on <i>Love</i>,<i> </i>the Beatles     catalog remix album and Cirque de Soleil soundtrack created by George Martin and his     son Giles. After an angelic ""Because""-- a capella, but here fluffed     up with bird songs-- there's the ""A Hard Days Night"" chord into Ringo's     drum solo on ""The End"", which then fades into ""Get Back"".</p>
<p>""Glass Onion"" was Lennon having fun with the Beatles myth,     referencing his earlier songs and mocking the tendency to ""decode""     them that would eventually get <i>way </i>out of hand when Beach Boys pal and     ""Never Learn Not to Love"" composer Charles Manson sent his minions     into Beverly Hills to commit mass murder. ""Glass Onion"" was Lennon's     attempt-- on the fly, while the band was at its peak-- at recontextualizing his     Beatles work, to remind us all that music is supposed to be fun. The joker was     laughing with us, jabbing an elbow in our sides to say, ""Hey, we're just a     pop band here, folks.""</p>
<p>That's a good thing to keep in mind with the Beatles. They <i>were</i> just a     pop band, even if they were possibly the greatest entity ever to fit that     particular classification. The Beatles were so good that they're not very     interesting to talk about-- it's like listening to someone drone on about the     Grand Canyon. No other band has generated as much dull commentary, even as the     music remains unimpeachable.</p>
<p>They're certainly the best band I almost never listen to. I'm guessing I     share this with a lot of music obsessives; the Beatles' music has been so     thoroughly absorbed into our consciousness that we can play the songs in our     heads any time we like. Which is why the idea of someone doing something new     with the catalog-- mixing and matching different songs, blending the whole     thing into an epic suite-- is potentially exciting. Any attempt to fiddle with     this music is like long-distance brain surgery, toying with our collective     memory with the hope of creating something new.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Love </i>I'm reminded first of a few artists that took from     the Beatles without their permission, and how illicit beginnings gave their samples     an extra hit of fun. There's the entire Danger Mouse/Jay-Z mashup <i>The Grey     Album</i>, of course, but I'm thinking of smaller details.<i> </i>When Ringo Starr's     solo from ""The End"" appears early here I go immediately to Jason     Forrest's ""Ten Amazing Years"", not <i>Abbey Road</i>. The swirl of strings     from ""Good Night"" stitched here to Ringo's ""Octopus's     Garden"" brings to mind Ekkehard Ehlers' drawn-out loop of the same phrase     that comprises the entirety of one side of ""Ekkehard Ehlers Plays John     Cassavetes"". Having all the mixes band-sanctioned loses a little     something. Paul McCartney is said to have heard <i>Love</i> and remarked that     he wished it went a bit further out. And it's hard not to agree, especially for     people used to hearing mash-ups and guerilla sonic deconstruction via laptop.     How badly do you want Yamatsuka Eye to do a <i>Rebore Vol. 0 </i>on this     material?</p>
<p>Really, the mashed-up bits here are just a seasoning, the occasional jarring     effect to remind us that we're not just sitting around listening to Beatles     records. Who knew that the backing track for ""Drive My Car"" fit     perfectly over verses from ""The Word"" and ""What You're     Doing""? The a capella ""Sun King"" sounds great backward on     ""Gnik Nus"" leading beautifully into ""Something"" and doesn't     contain any hidden messages beyond the one conveyed by the opening     ""Because""-- that the Beatles were great singers. ""Being for the     Benefit of Mr. Kite"" seems a natural soundtrack for tumbling acrobats,     and the coda to ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" sounds like it was made for this project.</p>
<p>As the album wears on, the songs get ""bigger"" and are also made to     stand on their own, without the mix trickery. But they also suffer from     truncation. It's great to hear a round of the ""Hey Jude""'s epic     chorus with just voice and drums, but the song means so much less at four     minutes than it does at seven, with a full verse cut and the final fade     happening earlier. I will say that hearing it pulled apart finally confirms     that Beta Band's ""Dry the Rain"" steals from it almost completely, one     instrument after another.</p>
<p>It seems impossible to follow the final chord of ""A Day in the     Life"", but the Martins are just closing the door on the darker, artier     aspect of the Beatles, letting the uplifting pop band carry the day during the     album's final section. The trimmed ""Hey Jude"", the reprise of     ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" (let's face it-- not great, but included because of     all the showbiz connotations) and then closing with ""All You Need Is     Love"".</p>
<p>What     seems to consume people most about this record is the sound of the thing, just     how beautifully the original material was recorded and how great it comes over     on a purely sonic level. The art of recording a rock band, it seems, reached     its zenith in the late 1960s. In terms of capturing guitar, bass, drums, and     voice, nothing since-- no matter how many tracks-- sounds as pure and lovely as     what the Beatles did at Abbey Road studios. <i>Love </i>is turning everyone into an     audiophile, then, which means it's making younger people a little older. And     it's also a mashup remix, which means it's making older people a little younger.     They were just a pop band, yes, but if anyone can bring all these music fans     together under one tent, it's the Beatles. Which is what <i>Love </i>is     ultimately all about.</p></div>"|9669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9669-love/|8.5|Mark Richardson

I'm old and cranky. My interests these days are bourbon, my bicycle, and the collected works of Al Green. And Pitchfork has already reviewed approximately 90,000 Depeche Mode albums, reissues, and compilations. (Nitsuh Abebe alone has reviewed 67,843 of them.) What's possibly left to say about these 18 songs except that capitalism marches ever onward? Or that if you really needed to hear a few songs off 2001's <em>Exciter</em> and 2005's <em>Playing the Angel</em>-- and, of course, one new tune-- that now you've got your chance?</p><p>
    When I was in the early days of high school, a time when kids in my study hall thought the riff in Collective Soul's ""Shine"" was, like, totally boss, Depeche Mode were dismissed as a ""gay keyboard band"" by a friend's cousin, a sentiment probably echoed no less than 2 million times over the past 20 years. We thought he was hella cool because he liked the Jesus Lizard and smoked unfiltered cigarettes. Actually, he was a douchebag who probably has throat cancer now. And though the Jesus Lizard are still great and his statement was perhaps accurate as a description, it doesn't stand up as criticism. Depeche Mode were a <em>great</em> keyboard band. Especially at the beginning, the band offered synthetic, electric hooks as pure and sugary as New Edition, something that's easy to forget with all the iron crucifixes and black-and-white videos that followed (a period which itself is not without its charms). Depeche more or less were formed in 1976 by Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher as No Romance in China. By 1980, they had settled into the name they're best remembered for and the basic lineup of Clark, Fletcher, Martin Gore, and Dave Gahan on vocals. Long before he was a strung out Jack Sparrow-- amazingly Googling ""Dave Gahan"", ""Jack Sparrow"" brought up not only results but Depeche Mode/dead pirate slash, proving once again that goth kids will never disappoint-- this dude was Lance Bass with vinyl vests and jaunty little caps.</p><p>
    Clarke left to form Yaz and then Erasure right after Depeche scored their first major hits, the British Top 10 ""Just Can't Get Enough"" and its parent album <em>Speak and Spell</em>. The remaining Depechies listened to their scary DAF records and knew that a whole generation of the sexually frustrated could relate, were it garnished with pretty Eurotrash boys with ropey arms and peroxide dye jobs and lyrics about how hard it is to be a sensitive flower. Being a sensitive flower who once tried to impress a girl by pointing out how much the lead character in <em>Sandman</em> looked like Robert Smith, you'd think this would have been right up my alley. But despite buying Joy Division albums through Columbia House, I was never a goth, and I listened to too much pop-punk and hardcore as a teenager to really lay back and wallow. ""Everything Counts"", from 1983's mini-mall industrial <em>Construction Time Again</em>, was recorded with newest member Alan Wilder. Gahan's voice had deepened and so had the timbre of the synthesizers; Depeche Mode would be catchy again, but they would never be upbeat. Leather and eyeliner were never part of my world; I wore the same Chuck Taylors and black T-shirt throughout high school. Even though I've got the requisite fucked up emotions when it comes to the meeting of sex and religious imagery, Depeche Mode's heavy-breathing lapsed Catholicism may have meant more if they, like me, dressed like the Ramones.
    </p><p>
    On the other hand, they meant a hell of a lot to a hell of a lot of other people. By the end of the 1980s, Depeche were, if not causing rioting in the streets, coming close enough: They were a legit teen phenomenon. <em>Some Great Reward</em> was the breakthrough. If the early records could sound thin and blippy, ""Master and Servant"" had the kind of Bonham-heavy drum machines that could reach the cheap seats in the stadiums the band clearly wanted to be playing to and would be soon enough. The band perfected a kind of music that you could do a sort of acute gastrointestinal disorder shuffle to, as kids without a funky bone in their bodies laced up their Doc Martins and gathered in pool halls and roller rinks done up in blacklight. <em>The Best of Volume 1</em> gives the short shrift to <em>Black Celebration</em>, the 1986 album that gave the gift of a name to goth club nights around the world. It turned out no real hits but it affirmed that Depeche Mode's sonic goal was total domination-- albeit domination that swayed with an anorexic's gait-- mixed with ballads that became mixtape staples.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Music for the Masses</em> (1987) made the ambition plain in the title. This was the beginning of Depeche's shift from synth-pop/fake-industrial/goth pioneers to ""modern rock"" pioneers, spoken of alongside New Order and, uh, World Party in that decade-changing pause for breath just before Nirvana briefly gave the keys to pop to guys like my friend's cousin and the Collective Soul fans in eighth period. ""Never Let Me Down Again"" plugs in the guitar, but it plugs it into the MIDI banks. Kinda rock, still mostly not. And then came <em>Violator</em>, the one Depeche Mode record that nearly everyone can agree on. Guitars! Like, actual prominent ones! As a few canny mixtape makers proved a few years ago, ""Personal Jesus"" is either throwback T.Rextacy or predicts Kompakt's techno-shuffle by a few billion years. Or it's both! Value for money! And you can listen to ""Enjoy the Silence"" alongside such sunny favorites as Jawbreaker's ""Sea Foam Green"". Emo! <em>Songs of Faith and Devotion</em> upped the grind/sleaze factor with singles like ""I Feel You"", but so did U2 during the middle of MacPhisto Madness, and you won't necessarily catch me stumping for that either. The band disappeared for a few years and returned with 97's <em>Ultra</em> (dingy, dubby, atmospheric, very pre-millennial tense) and 2001's <em>Exciter</em> (skeletal, grid-like, technoid, recorded under the director of LFO's Mark Bell), two turns toward the non-goth dancefloor that worked better remixed.
    </p>
<p>
    If this review seems confused between the 8+ rating and being basically indifferent to the idea of another shakedown of Depeche Mode history, you're not reading it wrong. The band's still putting out records and is a respectable part of rock history and so, yeah, multiple best-ofs and collections and remix compilations follow. I mean, I get it, but I'm not sure I <em>get it</em>, you know? Despite the evangelical efforts of Mike Shinoda, et al., the kids, they are not, how you say, plunking down close to 20 crumpled tooth fairy bills for a copy of the Depeche Mode best-of. In Phillip Sherburne's recent ""Month in Techno"" column, he claims to have recently repurchased a chunk of the Depeche catalog in a fit of funk, lamenting the fact that he's turned into one of those old dudes salving his pain with nostalgia for, like, old pain. So <em>that's</em> what this is for! I've been a miserable bastard lately, and this collection has indeed transported me back to a time I didn't even go through at the time, when a kid's most pressing problems could be dealt with by drawing the shades for six to eight hours.
    </p>
<p>
    I recently made my final trip to Tower Records, where people my age and up were snatching all sorts of greatest hits like it was a Black Friday white sale. Seeing people eyeball new records, at up to 70% off the sticker price, and still decide they weren't interested-- well, it was like watching the last days of Rome. Eventually, all music websites will be reviewing digital chunks downloaded directly into your cereal bowl every morning so you can be up on that prerelease leak as you eat your Wheaties. But best-of compilations will be among the last CDs to go. Those of us aghast and confused by the bleak, horrible future we've washed up in have to hold onto something.<br/>

    Pitchfork does not pay me enough to listen to this album one more time.
    Corrina Repp went and recruited members of 31Knots and Norfolk &amp;
    Western to help make one of the most intelligent and devastatingly
    downbeat ""relationship"" albums of this herky-jerk decade, for Mark
    ""Professionally Sad"" Kozelek's all-but private label. I planned a
    half-dozen detached ways to navigate this review. I considered typing about
    this one time at the beach when females were suddenly honest about the
    peanut butter &amp; canine cunnlingus urban legend (admitting ""girls
    are sick fucks""), which hopefully would have tapped into this album's
    ""wouldn't-you-like-to-know"" <em>Virgin Suicides</em> mystique. Or maybe
    about how one of this album's most why-people-cut-themselves anthems,
    ""All"", is named after the most grandiose of the whole insane range of
    grandiose names for laundry detergent. But <em>The Absent and the Distant</em> will not let me dodge its ""emo""-- okay, rebuke cutesyness, I mean ""emotional""-- tractor beam.</p><p>
    Every song on this album, even (perhaps especially) the instrumentals, is a magic, killer, <em>killer</em>
    bullet that might only work on a small percentage of the shopster
    populazzi. You have to be prayerfully anticipating the last time that
    you fail someone. You have to have recently been accused of
    masturbating with a towel lying atop your computer even though it was
    for navelgazer tears and snot. You have to have imagined that
    corpse-bog from <em>Lord of the Rings</em> filled with your exes. You
    have to be so consumed with a decision about a partner that all other
    decisions got left unmade; you have to have once felt so ""fixed"" by a
    significant other that all else in your life fell into disrepair, even
    as your brain scrambled ""disrepair"" to spell ""diaper, sir.""</p><p>
    I've used the weak, unvivid verb combo ""has/have"" eight times so far in
    this review, but only because Corrina Repp uses it so sharply, in re:
    not being able to be ""had"" or to ""have"" someone else. She recklessly
    examines the point at which wanting to ""have"" another person lapses
    into a tyrannical ownership fantasy, which then lapses into an
    existential realization about how we barely have ourselves. Repp also
    menacingly abuses the pronoun ""it"" without letting it modify anything
    in particular. She does so most violently during the monogamy-shuffling
    ""Anyone's It,"" which I can't continue to talk about.
    </p><p>
    Repp's recipe involves a churchy minimalist piano pattern overlaid with
    cold-chill trilling at the chorus from either a mandolin or another
    piano track or epically reverbed percussion. Her directness is
    disarming during this cultural moment that places such a high premium
    on gimmicks and obfuscation. Her huge vocals take up so much space in
    the mix that they'll remind you of the days when horror movies weren't
    about the body. Repp's a better balladeer than many of the bearded boys
    imagined to own the mode, and the songs often opt out of an easy
    sad/happy dynamic to shoot for double-edged truthiness: ""What if that
    safe place has secrets no one understands?"" ""You hurt because you love
    someone."" Friends of a new couple ""wonder why we're both a little
    gone."" Every conventionally sweet moment collides with a line measuring
    the loneliness love causes: ""Wait for me/ I'll wait for you/ O the
    things that we have lost."" The stately pose of Repp's used-to-be-human
    delivery prevents the lyrical sincerity from embarrassing itself,
    perhaps too often. 
    </p>
<p>
    Again, you probably have to doff your savvy consumer-armor and sit
    around in your sentimental fishnets to truly experience this album's
    captivating stillness, its relaxing sense of risk, its
    Broadcast-and-Patsy-Cline-make-a-folk-album-with-This-Mortal-Coil
    scope, and its portraits of lovers who anchor each more deeply in
    direct proportion to their insistence on remaining adrift. If you
    already sit around in sentimental fishnets all day, trust that you will
    not be able to handle <em>The Absent And The Distant</em>;
    it will have dismantled you long before the hymnic ""That Which Has No
    Remorse"" visits pews kept warm by 1970s Bob Dylan and 1990s Daniel
    Johnston. As a distraction from this disc's power, maybe shout ""deez
    nuts"" once per track, and keep CSS or something similarly silly-assed
    handy on your iTunes playlist.

    Brooklyn's Carlos Giffoni makes so much sense creatively, it's surprising that
    Murphy's Law didn't find a way to spoil the result. Both acts see electronic
    noisemaking as the careful arrangement of small aural events rather than the
    sound-wall splurge that noise artists often fall back on. But pairing such
    sonically busy types could have produced musical overkill, with each participant
    fighting for space or canceling each other out. Instead, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Northern Stains</span> is a smart synthesis of Giffoni's
    pointed, rapid-fire compositions and Fe-Mail's mix of sliced vocals, horns, and
    samples.</p><p>
    The five tracks here avoid becoming a blurry boxing match
    due to one simple strength: timing. By assembling distinct sounds that loop,
    pile up, and crumble back down, Fe-Mail and Giffoni have always used timing as
    a primary compositional tool on respective individual releases. Here, those
    crafty patterns hold up well when added together. Each piece is built around
    the when and where of each noise, perhaps even more so than what each noise
    actually sounds like.</p><p>
    The strongest example is ""Daymare Blues"", the album's
    seven-minute centerpiece. Here, the sonic range is relatively narrow; nearly
    every sound is vocally derived, mostly cartoon-like squawks and yelps. But the
    way the trio release and retract each blip and blurt is uncannily rich. It
    produces patches of melody, off-kilter beats, rhyming figures that leap over
    each other, and loops that fuse into abstract wholes like strokes in a Pollock
    painting. The piece may sound abstract, but its careful structures make it more
    a song than an experiment, much like the way Raymond Scott's sound-effect
    compositions are more like short stories than strings of one-liners.
    </p><p>
    Similar patterns form, collapse, and rebuild throughout
    the album. ""Moral Heritage"" melds video-game lasers and spiky growls
    (reminiscent of Nautical Almanac's impulsive rants) into a wash of guitar
    strums drenched by digital crunch. Later, ""Come, You Are"" sticks a chugging
    loop under stereo-spanning distortion ripples, while ""Not in Santa's Land""
    mixes rapid blips and engine-like roar into an eerie synth cloud.
    </p>
<p>
    The only anomaly on <em>Northern Stains</em> is its title track, which doles
    out noise in longer, thicker streams. It opens with Fennesz-like wash, then
    builds into the kind of dense squeal favored by underground noise-hounds like
    Hive Mind and the Cherry Point. But even this track feels more like a brainy composition
    than simply a sheet of sound hung out to dry. The tactile surface of the
    escalating drone gives the piece a detailed topography that in lesser hands
    might have been a smooth, unspectacular wave. Like the rest of <em>Northern
    Stains</em>, it blurs
    the line between structure and abstraction, but the craft behind it is crystal
    clear.

    clap-your-hands-say-shout-out vibes, the Edmonton sextet feels lukewarm
    at best on vinyl. I want to believe <em>Not Saying/Just Saying</em> electrifies the dancefloor as much as pop rocks and soda explode the stomach, but too much evidence says otherwise.</p><p>
    Part
    of the problem lies in the fact that these guys sound like an ensemble
    of fantasy camp superfans rather than a collection of honed musicians.
    The upside is they've garnered comparisons (albeit extremely forced
    ones) to rah-rah groups like the Go! Team or Junior Senior thanks to
    their unbridled dance-rock enthusiasm, which no doubt
    helped spawn this self-promoted, self-financed, and self-released debut.
    However, the band suffers from the same excessive dance fawning Jesse
    Keeler did with his MSTRKRFT side project, acting like kids in a candy
    store by pulling out every trope from multiple drummers (they got two
    plus a drum machine) to multiple bassists (four!) to vocoders galore.</p><p>

    addition to these gauche tastes, SO4 pack a fistful of in-your-face

    vocoder-laden vocals and stretches of prosaic soundscapes that dick
    around the periphery of krautrock and deep house, unable to deliver any
    knockout blow. Opener ""Forever Indebted"" wastes over three-quarters of
    its duration on uninspired build-up, and although the outro percolates,
    it can't justify the preceding four-plus minutes of stagnant <em>Discovery</em>
    imitation. When they do attempt an all-out assault on truculent rocker
    ""Chicken Soup For the Fuck You"", doubled-up bass riffs try to do the
    talking but stutter, making for a limp-wristed bastardization of
    DFA79's drum n' bass machisimo.
    </p><p>
    When these guys fully develop
    their ideas, they do show a capacity for producing some catchy hooks.
    The lyrics of ""Dude You Feel Electrical"" smack of boorishness, but the song's somber chorus bleeds more Robert
    Smith-style pathos than the rest of album combined. Closer ""Do I
    Stutter?"" further reveals a more pensive yet colorful side, meshing the
    calculating poker-face of krautrock with the glitzy synths of Van
    Halen's ""1984"". Changeups like these try to hedge the album's otherwise
    mindless dance surge and go figure, the smarter the hooks, the more
    galvanizing the song. Slathering every sound effect in the studio on
    some of these numbers just doesn't do justice to the band's live
    intensity, and SO4's debut ultimately struggles from a dearth of both
    visceral bite and meticulous songwriting.

U2 are not one of these bands. According to the liner notes in <i>18 Singles</i>-- a compilation timed for the holiday season which overlaps heavily with two previous best-ofs-- only half of these songs actually saw commercial release as singles in the United States. All others hit the charts in either the UK or Europe, and then there are two new songs, ""Window in the Skies"" and a cover of the Skids' ""The Saints Are Coming"", recorded with Green Day.</p>
<p>Revisiting familiar songs like ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"", ""New Year's Day"", ""One"", and ""Desire"" provides little in the way of new revelations. These songs have never gone away long enough to allow for a fresh listen, and they work now pretty much the way they always did. More than anything, they're likely to reinforce strong opinions that have had decades to harden. U2 have fans as passionate as any other upper-tier rock act, but they also have more haters than any of the other entities currently competing for ""Best Band in the World"" status-- not least because they're the only ones over 25 years old crass enough to make such a goal explicit. One link to a photo of Bono yanking up his flag-lined jacket at the Super Bowl is all that's needed to win an online argument about U2's obnoxiousness.</p>
<p>Still, I can swallow every argument against U2 whole without offering a rebuttal and acknowledge that their best songs up through <i>Zooropa </i>still move me. There's been a shift in the past year or two towards rock that strives to be big and audacious and ambitious and U2, love them or hate them, are one of rock's enduring Big and Important Band archetypes. And for a while, they also wrote great melodies, had a very clever and original guitar player, and had producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois working at the top of their games.</p>
<p>But only for a while, and U2's singles from the past 10 years are several steps down from the band's acknowledged classics. ""Vertigo"" wanted to be raw but came over as bland alternarock; ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out of"" was Bono rolling downhill with his feet off the pedals. ""Beautiful Day"", on the other hand, was a bald-faced try at recapturing past glories, and against all odds it succeeded, in part because of that ""Touch Me"" melodic fragment nicked from A-Ha.</p>
<p>The late-period drop-off is more apparent on the two new tracks. ""The Saints Are Coming"", which debuted in the Louisiana Superdome during a Monday Night Football halftime, finds U2 and Green Day trying to keep its New Orleans association alive by opening the song with Billie Joe Armstrong crooning a painfully thin verse from ""The House of the Rising Sun"". The sleepy and flat vibe he imparts with his intro continues through the rest of the song. ""Window in the Skies"" is a little better; it's got a decent chorus with Bono on falsetto, and it's one of his songs where he's singing about love but could be thinking about something else. I'd say it's no ""Sweetest Thing"", but I never liked the rerecorded version included here nearly as much as the original B-side.</p>
<p>At this point U2 is so omnipresent-- and Bono has so thoroughly ingratiated himself to the baby boomer power players in every field-- that it's hard to imagine them losing cultural relevance again, as they did in the late 1990s. They're always nearby in times of strife, ready to help broken cities and stunned nations heal with a dose of epic rock'n'roll. As long as there is calamity, U2 will remain relevant. Maybe that's why they fell off during Clinton's second term-- the West had forgotten what real trouble was all about, and there was nothing for U2 to push against. As for <i>18 Singles</i>, you might check out those earlier comps instead.</p></div>"|9660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9660-18-singles/|7.0|Mark Richardson

    the Absence of Truth</em>, comes packed with surprises. As
    might be expected following their
    2004 breakthrough and subsequent big-time tour with Tool, the Los Angeles quintet  expands the
    template solidified (and some would say mastered) on <em>Oceanic</em> and pushed to the outer limits amid <em>Panopticon</em>'s sloshy trenches.</p><p>
<em>I</em><em>n
    the Absence of Truth</em> goes further than those albums, but without ditching the signature elements--
    sharp, delayed/chorused guitar notes (the underwater bunker sound), swirling and
    ambient
    keyboards, crisp and dynamic drum and bass, Aaron Turner's meditational
    chants and drowning-man growls. Everything's more expansive and exploratory here, and
    fresh
    off <em>Blood Mountain</em>,
    Isis's regular recordist Matt Bayles buffs each of the nine tracks with
    some hazy gauze, lodging a truly sleek, sumptuous, fathomless
    recording.
    In fact, the set's <em>so</em> finely wound that on the first few
    listens it seemed like the steady diet of Tool had perhaps transformed Isis into
    an emaciated, innocuous version of their older selves. Not at all,
    kneejerks-- these
    songs just require close (and repeated) listening to initiate an
    unravelling (It took me two months before I felt the background music
    become total immersion). The band's never been ham-fisted, but <em>In the Absence</em> offers
    fewer crowd-pleasing quiet-to-loud dynamics-- though they are there-- and there are
    plenty of unexpected inversions: Excellent opener ""Wrist of
    Kings"" displays a three-minute tension-grabbing intro that slows and
    swivels instead of cresting, allowing Turner to soar, almost a whisper,
    over math-y drums. Smashing expectations, a few minutes later the crush
    and vocal growl emerge, long after the initial build has recoiled.</p><p>
    Isis
    continue to embrace the epic-- this is their longest outing, the
    majority of songs in the seven/eight-minute range. There are also techy
    upgrades. Injected with a dose of croon, Turner's broadened his vocal
    approach (and Bayles
    mixes the growls more smoothly). He seems less afraid to just sing.
    Sure, he
    gets a tad alt at the start of ""Holy Tears"", but the song finds
    redemption in its complex arpeggios, monster outro, and pretty,
    breathless keys. Or, to see a more interesting moment in his
    development, as well as Bayles' increased array of vocal effects, look
    at the
    psychedelically waterlogged ""1000 Shards"", which builds to a sloshy
    mosh part and some powerfully hoarse scowls, before sinking into
    whispers and the instrumental set piece ""All Out of Time, All Into
    Space""'s distorted wind, flange, and aquatic firestorms.
    Not every expansion's a hit, however. Named for
    Hassan-i-Sabbah's garden, ""Firdous E Bareen"" is a montage that
    ostensibly approximates the feel of an acolyte coming to in the mountainous
    faux-Eden, thinking he'd died and been reborn: dub percussion, electro,
    backwards spinning tape, tribalism, bird sounds, acoustic
    strums, sitar, hand drums collide. It's a tad like Isis from the
    <em>Oceanic Remixes / Reinterpretations</em> album, though they're adding the extraneous elements themselves. Recovering
    the gravity and beauty of the rest of the album, the final, longest track,
    ""Garden of Light"", starts with a pleasing languor and moves to
    that blue-tinted <em>Panopticon</em> rock, before ushering in an uproarious
    <em>Disintegration</em> shoe-gaze-- Heaven truly attained? For those who chaff
    at these sorts of shoe-gazer references, listen to the last few minutes
    of ""Garden of Light"" and then download some Ride. I'll wait here a few minutes. 
    </p><p>
    Conceptually,
    Hassan-i-Sabbah, the 11th/12th Century Persian mystic, shows up
    throughout these pieces. Pig Destroyer (and countless other rockers)
    have recently reminded us, ""Nothing is true. Everything is permitted,""
    but it
    is interesting to watch how far (and personally) Turner takes it. Plus,
    folks usually
    discover the idea with William S. Burroughs-- Turner unearthed it in
    Mark Danielewski's postmodern staple, <em>House of Leaves</em>. There
    <em>is</em> some WSB: ""All Out of Time, All Into Space"" shows most famously, to this young punk geek at least, in ""The
    Last Words of Hassan Sabbah"" (and, uh, can you guess the real Sabbah's supposed last words?). From a different side of the bookshelf, note the romantic resonances of ""Dulcinea"", named after the
    apple of reality-blind <em>Don Quixote</em>'s eye (or that old Toad the Wet Sprocket
    record). In interviews Turner has also mentioned Borges' <em>Labyrinths</em> (which includes a character rewriting <em>Don Quixote</em>) and the Bible among other textual
    inspirations.  
    </p>
<p>
    These
    intertwining references might be fun, but despite that ""heady metal""
    tag, they aren't integral to the experience. If Turner was just
    opening his mouth and spitting empty syllables (which may be the
    case!), <em>In the Absence of Truth</em>
    would still prove one of the year's most compelling, moving listens. Really, despite a couple
    brief dull spots, the ingredients are so carefully selected
    and masterfully performed that the collection creates a pretty
    endlessness, existing at its best as one long take of dark-n-stormy
    post-rock. You should be in quiet awe, not destroying the moment by running to Wikipedia.

Their     songs are composed using discreet musical shapes, more often sharp-edged than     rounded. ""Never Liked This Time of Day"", for instance, has a couple of drum     shapes, a few keyboard shapes, and a pair of vocal shapes, with guitar modules     waiting in the wings, and it combines them like Legos to build a song that     sounds like it could be a chart hit assembled incorrectly.</p>
<p>This, the band's second album, was engineered and produced (you     might say co-constructed) by Scott Solter, who was then handed back the tapes     to deconstruct them and create a sort of <i>Stowaway</i> dub side, using nothing but the sounds on the tapes. You can imagine that music     so oddly constructed in the first place would present a feast for a remixer,     and Solter's approach is to explode the songs and pluck just a few elements for     his re-imaginings. Where <i>Stowaway</i> can     sometimes sound like four arcade games being played simultaneously, <i>Canonic</i> is dark, weird, and even more     abstract than its source.</p>
<p>My favorite odd couple from the two records is ""It's     the Wine"" and the dub ""In Tape Grass"". ""It's the Wine"" begins with meandering     verses, as keyboards and vocals double each other in clipped, woozy phrases.     ""It's the wine/ That makes your/ Kisses warm,"" sings Andrew Thiboldeaux as     drummer Chris Ward holds down a steady backbeat. It's pieced together like a     slot car track, veering off at funny angles with only the slightest hints from     Ward that something is about to go down. The song gets better as it continues,     winding up in a slashing groove topped with ragged guitar and keyboards that     sound like an ice cream truck signaling us to evacuate before the bomb drops.</p>
<p>Solter attacks it with destructive glee, building a     sculpture mostly out of the small details of ""It's the Wine"" that you don't pay     much attention to. He takes individual drums hits and builds them into a simple     rhythm that morphs as easily as mercury, beginning raw and alone and     palpitating into more spastic shapes as the music demands. The keyboards are     freed from the vocals, and the rhythm guitar from the verse gets its own     spotlight at the climax.</p>
<p>Both records have their flaws and tracks that don't work     quite as well as the others. <i>Stowaway</i> has opener ""Maple"", where the vocal,     doubled by electric piano, is just too disorienting, and the middle of ""People and Touch"", where the repetition of the phrase ""Can I buy this back here?""     feels designed to frustrate the nerves. But the slide guitar interlude in ""Two     Voices for Two Sections"" and the surprising human heart that beats at the center     of ""She Already Knows It"" offer redemption enough for those. ""Talk Back To Me"" is     just a cool, warped rock song, with a rubbery chorus and quiet, bleating verses     intuitively loud.</p>
<p>""In Glasstone"", Solter's analog to ""Talk Back To Me"", pulls Thiboldeaux's     chorus vocal like taffy and makes a hook out of a secondary melodic phrase,     shoving the verse vocals all the way to the back so they sound trapped and far     less plaintive than the originals. On ""Abrade the Beat"", he turns ""Silver     Queen"" completely inside out, tossing Thiboldeaux into an echoing canyon of     drums to fend off keyboard phrases that slice in seemingly at random. His     version of ""She Already Knows It""-- ""Diamond Back""-- doesn't do much, though, and     winds up floundering in shapeless static.</p>
<p>Taken together, the two albums form a unique sort of     call-and-response where you can listen to a song and then immediately go to its     alter-ego for a different perspective. <i>Stowaway</i> is a little too heady at times, and doesn't quite have the immediate teeth of PIM's     debut, <i>The (Im)possibility of Longing</i>,     but it's still a head-spinning record full of unique ideas. <i>Canonic</i> is like the weirdest member of a     weird family, the one who's kept away from the neighbors, slowly going mad     trying to put together puzzles. It's ultimately a completely different piece of     music, but it shares a cantankerous spirit with its source. You could certainly     listen to each separately, but they're much more rewarding as a pair.</p></div>"|11890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11890-stowawaycanonic-scott-solter-plays-pattern-is-movement/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    is the best friend an electronic producer can have. Back in 2000, Alary
    and singer Chanelle Kimber released their humble blip of a debut, <em>Sketch Proposals</em>, on Richard D. James's
    Rephlex imprint to minimal fanfare and scarce distribution. At some point,
    though, Björk heard it. And she liked it. So, after filing a few remixes for
    the singer, co-producing the best song on <em>Medulla</em>
    (""Desired Constellation""), and breaking ties with
    girlfriend/collaborator Kimber, this experimental wonk updated his résumé and sought out some
    bigger name voices to bolster his next project. The eponymous outcome features odd-couple Cat Power and Lou Barlow, a far denser noise-folk attack,
    and the inevitable heightened expectations. While the full-fledged pieces found on <em>Ensemble</em> are pristine, they
    can be too perfect. At his best, Alary marries vocalist with backdrop with
    eerie, shadowy sonics, but there are moments when he fine tunes everything
    to a fault and the orchestration, beeps, strums, and static become little more
    than saccharine gloss.</p><p>
    Unsurprisingly, the album's leading talent, Chan Marshall,
    is responsible for its most striking song. ""Disown, Delete"" puts the
    singer's husky drawl upfront as Alary supports her meandering melodies with a deliberate
    crescendo of white noise, fluttering strings, and throbbing acoustic guitar. Its
    patience and austerity is easy and organic. And there's a disarming loveliness to
    its unfinished quality-- something like early Beth Orton stretched out over a
    Fennessz refrigerator hum. Brighter and fuller, ""Summerstorm"" is a
    Free Design-style slice of 1960s pop featuring Brit chanteuse Mileece's airy
    vocals. The psychedelic track works in the same future-past time warp as
    Caribou's <em>Up In Flames</em>, with
    freak-out sax sidling up to smoothed-out breakbeats. It's a breezy seven-minute
    epic that never wears its welcome.</p><p>
    But the craftsmanship that adds beaming energy to ""Summerstorm"" can also result in generic niceties. Take the Barlow track, ""One Kind Two Minds"". As
    the indie straggler gives up plaintive lines about being ""frightened by
    the beauty,"" Alary again begins to painstakingly build the track around him. But
    once his corroded distortions edges in, the song is already on its way
    to Duncan Sheik territory. And the producer's clean guitar + sumptuous strings formula
    gets tired by the time ""Loose"" rolls around, a hookless, 10-minute bore sung by Alary and Camille Claverie. <em>Ensemble</em>'s extended song lengths alternately allow pieces to
    move forward carefully and stagnate. And with so many lulls already built into
    each song, filler tracks featuring new-age alarm clock found sounds-- licking
    waves, strong winds-- are frustratingly indulgent.
    </p><p>
    While this record marks vast development from the tiny music found on <em>Sketch Proposals</em>, some of Alary's past humility is missed amidst
    these grand soundscapes. Both of his career peaks thus far (""Disown,
    Delete"" and ""Desired Constellation"") have the studio whiz
    backing away from his schmaltzy, overdone tendencies and working hard to
    provide Marshall and Björk with subtler trimmings that greatly magnify their
    natural gifts. If Alary can learn to love his role as star supporter,
    his atmospheric expertise should move into the lead.

    No pressure or anything, but if Cale Parks-- the touring drummer for Joan of
    Arc and the full-time percussionist in Aloha-- ever wants to find crossover
    success, Polyvinyl needs to look into product-and-positioning plans for
    Borders listening stations. Both to his credit and fault, Parks' solo debut, <em>Illuminated Manuscript</em>, sounds a lot like
    this decade's attempt at turning electronic music and 20th-century classical
    into adult-oriented rock. In 20 years, might Parks be honorary first mate on
    the Carnival Electronic Music Cruise?</p><p>
<em>Illuminated Manuscript</em> is the
    sort of one-man, laptop-and-loop based album that's supposed to compensate for
    its lack of head with a surplus of heart. But Parks isn't dumb: His
    comprehension of layers and dynamics is superb, and-- given that <em>Illuminated Manuscript</em> was recorded on
    borrowed machines while on tour-- he's a skilled engineer. His drum sounds are
    alternately punchy and graceful, and he has a knack for distending miniature
    melodies across the space of a song, building big, structured pockets capable
    of providing comfort almost instantaneously.</p><p>
    But here's the rub: <em>Illuminated Manuscript </em>feels
    <em>entirely</em> like a record about easy
    acclimation, a college-sized survey through the past several decades of fringe
    composition carved into careful and palatable lessons. All the ugliness has
    been bowdlerized or, at the very least, swept under a rug of pitch-perfect
    glockenspiels and sequenced synthesizers. The more accessible entries have been
    highlighted, enumerated as gateways. The controlled static hovering over
    ""Galaxy 8180"", for instance, cedes to Parks voice, as though afraid
    to add something the least bit alienating (or provocative). And the multiple,
    vamped piano flourishes-- which, lo and behold, manage to dance above and below
    the key-- get buried beneath everything on ""I Am the Arm"". Instead of
    piquing interest, they purport texture. 
    </p>
<p>
    But, while Parks' sonic recalcitrance makes Styrofoam sound like Merzbow,
    it's his self-imposed compositional diminution that ultimately makes <em>Illuminated
    Manuscript </em>so underwhelming. ""Late Show"" opens with a slow
    nod to Steve Reich's pulse-driven phases, malleted metals and Farfisa trailing
    one another in rigid steps. But Parks limits his pulses, adding the last true
    layer only two minutes in, long before reaching the complexity that Reich used
    to his advantage. Parks simply preserves the same melodic lines for the second
    half of the track, using drum rolls and cymbal fans to add simple but
    saturating textures. Likewise, ""Fearsome Opponent""-- a Neu! beat
    bathed in cheap ethereal tones-- always sounds like it wants to be something
    bigger than itself, but it only motors onward, all listless, pretty, and
    innocuous. <em>Illuminated Manuscript </em>is decent
    as soundtracks for the workday go, but it's utterly forgettable and nice, the
    sort of docile but erudite record that points to its predecessors without
    ambitions of eclipsing them.

When most Americans finally ""met"" the Beatles' following their February 1964 <i>""</i>Ed Sullivan Show"" appearance, four distinct personalities emerged (and have stuck ever since): cute one, smart one, quiet one, and Ringo. While no one's predicting a similar cultural impact for Hello Saferide's long-overdue stateside arrival, the Swedish indie pop artist's <i>Introducing...</i> is in its own way just as effective at introducing a unique and consummately charming personality.</p>
<p>Like people, the best songs ""have a face,"" country songwriter Cindy Walker used to say. As a vinyl-only U.S. reissue by webzine/label/mail-order It's a Trap!, <i>Introducing... </i>shows us Hello Saferide's face in full 12"" clarity: Annika Norlin, who sings and writes the songs, has a tall forehead and unguarded gaze, her lips parted in a half smile or the start of a question as she fidgets with her cardigan. Over 13 short songs built on simple college-troubadour acoustic guitar (including U.S. bonus track ""The Quiz""), a character emerges who is at once tender, witty, self-aware, insecure, and occasionally hedonistic. Most of all, in an indie scene that all too often equates incoherence with brilliance, Norlin's protagonist feels unmistakably real.</p>
<p>Though I have only just been introduced to Hello Saferide's music, I feel like I already know the person in her songs. Many of you might, too. She's ""the kind that sees the sun and brings an umbrella"" and worries as much about the risk a boyfriend will listen to ""symphony rock"" as she does about the chance he'll sleep around. She visits fortunetellers, hates Jedi and hobbits, regrets drinking to excess but does it anyway, and lies awake at night, Boy Least Likely To-like, fretting over non-existent spiders. She approves of Merle Haggard, Kate Bush, ""Townes and Jens,"" <i>Spiderman</i> comics, and ""Seinfeld"" but not T-shirts depicting the cast of 1980s soap ""Falcon Crest"" except when she's really lonely. She might let you take her home-- ""no awkard breakfasts, I swear""-- only to fall fast asleep. She likes a boyfriend who puts out when she come homes drunk.</p>
<p>That's the album, but each Hello Saferide song has a face worth remembering, too. The one you'll spend giddy moments with first is probably ""Highschool Stalker"", with its carefree handclaps, whoa-oh-ohs, mariachi trumpet, and too-detailed reminiscences of looking up a crush's name on Altavista and Yahoo! (the ubiquitous Google's absence here is as satisfying as it is creepily historically accurate). Equally upbeat songs like ""San Francisco"" and ""My Best Friend"" imagine ""the only place in North America not destroyed by the government"" and Norlin's practical wish that she were lesbian, respectively-- ""No men ever really dance like this,"" Norlin explains. Deceptively peppy, trumpet-led ""If I Don't Write This Song, Someone I Love Will Die"" girds itself with superstitions befitting its title.</p>
<p>The quiet songs, like quiet people, take a little longer to get to know. But they're just as rewarding-- if only shy acquaintances came with lyric sheets! Reissue bonus track ""The Quiz"", from 2006's <i>Would you let me play this EP 10 times a day? </i>EP, plays new-relationship 20 questions before popping the big one: ""If I'd fall, would you pick me up?"" I start to melt every time. ""Long Lost Penpal"", with electronic programming and a guest appearance from fellow Swedish indie-popster Firefox AK's Andrea Kellerman, feints toward bathetic cliché-- e.g., my penpal stopped me from killing myself!-- before a surprise twist befitting the Internet era: one letter writer was actually a 46-year-old man named Luke with three kids and an uncaring wife (but how'd he manage to fake a teenage girl's handwriting?). On ""I Thought You Said Summer Is Going to Take the Pain Away"", Norlin wonders why a sweetheart isn't with her doing crossword puzzles, while by spare, rain-soaked ""I Don't Sleep Well"" everything is actually pretty great-- which is, of course, absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p>A few people might find Hello Saferide, like the best of Norlin's current Swedish contemporaries, too cute for comfort. If such cynics would rather hang out with assholes and imbeciles, well, let them. In the mold of Jonathan Richman circa <i>The Modern Lovers </i>or <i>Rockin' and Romance</i>, Norlin is a gifted anti-punk. Her lyrics tend to invite even more pangs of embarrassment than Richman's: ""I don't feel fat anymore/ And I don't count my blackheads as a hobby,"" or ""Do you still keep pictures of old girlfriends/ Are they prettier than me?"", or ""You're the cutest thing I've ever seen-- like a teddy bear on heroin.""</p>
<p>A recent <i>New York Times</i> article on state-sponsored indie rock hinted that some Scandinavian bands merely imitate U.S. culture, but it's difficult to imagine an American acoustic singer/songwriter so unironically addressing the psyche of awkward, lovesick, body-conscious 20-somethings without getting entangled in sex/class politics, soft-rock fluff, or worse. Hello Saferide, by contrast, just sings about being a person-- and an endearing one, at that. It's a pleasure to finally meet her.</p></div>"|9631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9631-introducing/|7.8|Marc Hogan

But for Tom Waits, this is old news, having long ago earned the status of perennially lauded/critically invulnerable artists alongside Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen.  At this point, the only thing left open to debate is, to paraphrase Stephen Colbert, Tom Waits: a great songwriter, or the <em>greatest</em> songwriter?</p><p>
<em>Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers &amp; Bastards</em> may seem like an unusual set upon which to make such a facetious judgment, given that the set is promoted as a collection of outtakes, leftovers, and rarities.  But that's not quite true; for an artist like Waits, who has built his reputation on consistency and durability, it's somewhat appropriate to assess his value on the basis of his deep cuts.  What's more, <em>Orphans</em> isn't really a career-spanning outtake collection at all, what with Tom going George Lucas on the proceedings and splicing in new songs and re-recordings.  The end product, neatly compartmentalized into three style-segregated discs, is about as perfect a summary of Waits' appeal as can be found on the open market, a shadow greatest hits that offers testimony to his unique and diverse talents without recycling any of his album material.</p><p>
    Looking at Waits' career from a distance reveals a number of contradictions: gravel-raw hobo-rock alternating with tender jazz-crooner torch songs, one foot in blues-roots traditionalism and one ear to modern sounds (cf. the turntables and beatboxing on 2005's <em>Real Gone</em>), inhabiting various fictional personae or pouring out his heart like a bottle.  So it makes sense to trisect his style, creating a disc for each faction of Waits' diverse audience: <em>Brawlers</em> for the dudes who dress and groom like Waits' stage character, <em>Bawlers</em> for the SUV drivers who found Waits by way of Rod Stewart, and <em>Bastards</em> for the people who thought the singer's high water mark was his role in Francis Ford Coppola's <em>Dracula</em>.
    </p><p>
<em>Brawlers</em> presents probably the best-known of Tom Waits' personalities, filled as it is with vocal cord damage, found percussion, old-timey arrangements, and cartoon-buzz lead guitar.  It's also the disc that flirts most dangerously with cliché, filled as it is with his well-trod inventory of Americana underbelly images: trains, jailhouses, barrooms, etc.  However, the secret of Waits' act is how well he deploys these should-be-tired cultural touchstones; at the very least, he sounds more comfortable in the role of a boxcar-hopper than he does reciting the ripped-from-the-headlines Middle East folk song ""Road to Peace"".  Certainly it helps that he continues to buck the aging rocker career trend of increasing cleanliness, wrapping these songs in dirt-grit production that keeps the Big Bopper warble of ""Lie to Me"" or the garage 12-bar Ramones cover ""The Return of Jackie and Judy"" from sounding like a House of Blues exhibit.
    </p>
<p>
    The tone of <em>Bawlers</em>, on the surface, is every bit as soothing as <em>Brawlers</em> is abrasive.  But for all the gentle piano and brass embellishments, the mood is far from serene, inhabiting the bittersweet, sentimental borderline between a bender and hangover.  Given that this sound goes back to Waits' earliest days, the timeframe is wider here than elsewhere in the set, yet it holds together with a late-night woozy consistency while veering from AM-radio jazz (""You Can Never Hold Back Spring"") to folk (""Widow's Grove""), and intimate (""World Keeps Turning"") to show-stoppingly anthemic (""Never Let Go"", ""Down There By the Train"").  More than any other disc, <em>Bawlers</em> is proof that Waits can pull these kind of nightclub-act songs out of his derby hat at will, able to channel the archetypal piano-man character with minimal effort.
    </p>
<p>
    All the more impressive then that he's made the effort to sabotage that typecasting, as exemplified by the set's most fascinating disc, <em>Bastards</em>.  Collecting all the odd items that don't fall into a simple quiet-loud dichotomy, <em>Bastards</em> reveals Waits at his most theatrical, filled with weird spoken-word monologues, gypsy-opera arrangements, a capella experiments, and demented covers.  Few people can make music that's authentically frightening without crossing the line into campy silliness, yet this is another skill Waits can lay claim to; look no further than the Disney nightmare of his ""Heigh Ho"" or the ghoulish nature documentary of ""Army Ants"".  There may be nothing else on these three discs as striking as ""Dog Door"", his collaboration with Sparklehorse that traps Waits' repertoire of voices in a funhouse of synths and tape loops, a thrilling (and teasingly rare) modern take on his familiar formula.
    </p>
<p>
    But you can't really fault Waits for only dipping an occasional toe into modern sounds, as his career has been built on being a living repository of 20<sup>th</sup> century American music and culture, while turning the neat trick of engaging that history rather than curating it.  <em>Orphans</em>, most notably, is smoking-gun evidence of Waits' remarkable longevity, as it's hard to think of many other artists that could place new material adjacent to old without the result sounding disjointed or wildly disparate in quality.  It's enough to add another layer of invulnerability to the already untouchable critical status of Tom Waits, an unlikely benefit coming from a cleaning-house box set.

    There's a moment near the end of ""Playa
    Cardz Right (Male)""-- one of 13 ""new"" songs on <em>Pac's
    Life</em>-- where Tupac Shakur has a conversation with Ludacris. Luda rose
    to fame years after Shakur was murdered, and the two probably never
    met, but there they are on wax, giggling banalities about their
    friends. It's not a real conversation, of course. Years ago, Tupac
    was just finishing off a track with a minute or so of adlibs, so
    Ludacris is just responding to the stuff Pac has already said,
    putting all his acting skills to work so that it can sound like these
    two guys were in the same room together at some point. The effect is
    weirdly asskissy, like Tupac couldn't give a shit what Ludacris has
    to say, like he just goes on talking anyway without bothering to
    acknowledge the guy constantly agreeing with him. Tupac: ""Castro is
    a straight gorilla pimp."" Ludacris: ""Yeah, my homeboy I20's the
    <em>same way</em>, man!""</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
<em>Pac's Life</em> is the sixth posthumous
    2Pac album, not counting soundtracks or reissues or greatest hits albums.
    He's been dead for 10 years, and he's released more albums since his
    death than he put out when he was alive. That means the enormous well
    of unreleased material he left behind has been pretty well drained,
    and we're not going to learn much about him from new records. Instead, these albums might tell us a thing or two about the rap landscape into which
    they're being released. Plenty of the contributors to <em>Pac's Life</em> are
    too young to have had any meaningful contact with Tupac during his
    lifetime, and when they show up on the same track as the man, they're
    paying tribute. Rappers who depict themselves as kings of the world
    suddenly become bubbly sycophants. After all, none of them can ever
    hope to get anywhere near the levels of credibility as someone who
    died at the age of 25, who was riddled with bullets more than once
    before dying, who shot two police officers and didn't do any time for
    it, who declared war on an entire coast, whose 73 million records
    sold make him the biggest-selling rapper of all time. None of Tupac's
    posthumous collaborators can compete with him, so they just compare
    themselves to him. On the title track, T.I. Says, ""Lived by the
    same rules, so minus the tattoos/ We the same sort of dude with the
    same short fuse."" For T.I., that's humility.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    But <em>Pac's Life</em> doesn't exactly pay
    tribute to the actual life of Tupac Shakur. It's about the legend of
    the unrepentant thug who was too uncontainable to live. The problem
    is that that legend is way less interesting than the actual life of
    Tupac Shakur, someone who studied Shakespeare as a child before
    running away from home, who rocked a bathrobe and a shower cap
    onstage as a backup dancer for Digital Underground, who wrote moving
    tributes to pregnant teenagers when he wasn't rapping about murdering
    their brothers. Tupac contained multitudes, and he gleefully
    contradicted himself at every turn. But <em>Pac's Life</em> presents an image
    of Tupac as nothing more than a grim-faced thug, and that's not
    really much of a tribute. 
    </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Of course, even when he's barking
    nihilistic clichés, Tupac's voice is still a deep, heavy sneer, and
    it sounds great over Swizz Beatz' thundering drums and sputtering
    guitars on ""Untouchable (Swizz Beatz Remix)"". But most of the
    tracks on <em>Pac's Life</em> are low-budget synth-preset bullshit, like
    LT Hutton's treacly synth fluff on the title track or Sha Money XL's
    tinkling quiet-storm pianos on ""Playa Cardz Right (Male)"". The
    guest-spots haven't been chosen with much care, either; we get an
    inexplicable grab-bag of superstars (Luda, T.I., Snoop Dogg) and
    nobodies (Nipsey Hussle, Jay Rock). Tha Outlawz, Pac's group of
    protégés, show up more than once, and that might confer some sort of
    legitimacy on the project, but they're still a shitty group of
    rappers. To say that Tupac himself is the best thing about these
    tracks isn't to pay him a huge compliment. It's sort of fun to
    predict who might sound fit to hold a track with the man (Young Buck)
    and who won't (Chamillionaire), but that's not enough of a reason for
    this mess to exist. <em>Pac's Life</em> is just another cash-in, the latest in
    a long line.

    Max Richter's résumé becomes, nearly without exception, part
    and parcel to every review of his music: The German-born composer studied piano
    in Edinburgh and then at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He worked with
    electronics in Florence with Luciano Berio and co-founded Piano Circus, an
    ensemble devoted to work by 20th century composers such as Steve Reich and Arvo Pärt.
    In the mid-1990s, he collaborated with Future Sound of London, lending his piano
    and sampling experience to the long-running duo.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Sure, as paying dues in the field of new music goes,
    Richter's past is worthy of mention. But plundering his curriculum vitae also
    renders a certain logical lens for his work as a solo composer, a productive
    means of analyzing his self-described ""post-Classical"" compositions for
    strings, piano, electronics, and spoken word: When a Richter album-- especially
    his latest,<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> Songs From Before</span><span>-- is
    disassembled with his lineage in mind, its pieces are identifiable, clear
    precursors and allegiances made obvious. Electronic passages-- here,
    manipulated recordings of short-wave radio segments-- form both the
    underpinnings and segue sequences in Richter compositions. Their distant
    ambience reflects the foundations of Brian Eno's colossal ambient work (which
    Richter played with Piano Circus) and the corrupted warmth of Iannis Xenakis'
    best electronic pieces (which he studied with Ferio). Richter employees triads,
    so cinematic as they guide the perfect solstitial redolence of ""Autumn Music
    1"", as freely and fondly as Pärt, and his rhythmic intricacy, so perfect as it
    guides the string-and-piano counterpoints of the splendid ""Autumn Music 2"", is
    an extension of Reich's pointillist thrust. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But, much as he did with 2004's beautiful<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> The Blue
    Notebooks</span><span>,</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span><span>Richter combines these disparate and proven ideas
    into fresh, emotive work. His central aesthetic of absolute taste-- from Robert
    Wyatt's staid readings of Haruki Murakami's writings to the gravitational rise
    of ""Flowers for Yulia""-- is manifested, compositionally, through omnipresent
    motion. Richter's pieces are rarely still even if somewhat static, a facet
    epitomized by his strength with rubato, a classical technique for maintaining
    the essential meter of a passage by temporarily slowing or quickening the
    rhythm. It conjures an overwhelming emotional tizzy, bouts of rhythmic
    unpredictably guiding the familiar patterns of Richter's beloved minor triads.
    ""Autumn Music 2"" bridges these tendencies into a stunning manifesto where the
    strings and Richter's piano pull one another between poles of regret and
    redemption. Indeed, moments like these-- a four-minute emotional rapture, a
    90-second string movement slightly damaged by radio receiver's static, a brief
    passage about true shades of blue-- show Richter's brilliance. By not
    distending his pieces in order to manifest his own dexterity, he does just
    that, squeezing multiple notions into slight spaces. The result is potency:
    Richter's music makes marionettes of otherwise reasonable people, his scoring
    hands the minor deities controlling strings capable of engendering
    instantaneous passions, regrets and decisions with simple melodic figures.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    To that end, little here is ever belabored or iterative:
    This is quicker music for a quicker world, and it's Richter's most cohesive
    album to date. Of the 41 tracks he has released on the three albums billed
    under his own name, three of them breach seven minutes. None of these are on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Songs From Before</span><span>. This, very nearly, is pop
    music. Its self-aware brevity and dynamic could miff contemporaries in
    both classical and electronic music. But Richter is guided by proper artistic
    license: He understands that his predecessors-- from Brahms and Bach to Pärt
    and Glass-- made their marks in worlds apart from his own creative context, but
    that those composers borrowed liberally from the folk music (that is, the music
    at the center of their society's conscience) for the sake of source material
    and, quite simply, piqued audience interest. The Germans even had a word for
    Brahms' folk embodiments, </span><span>and Beethoven lifted a Russian folk melody for a
    string quartet to please a Russian emissary. Richter takes techniques from the
    classics and modifies their approach to make more appropriate-- but no
    less efficacious-- statements for his own circumstances. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Given <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Songs From Before</span><span>'s
    thematic conceit, this is appropriate: Richter isn't interested in changing the
    way the world hears his music as much as idealizing how he wants to hear it.
    He resurrects past idols for present idioms, his heroes, proclivities and
    experiences donned as unrepentantly as the nostalgia at </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Songs</span><span>' core. </span>

    We're in the middle of a deluge of late-afternoon music: song after
    song drenched in reverb and echo, inching along at plodding, hot sun tempos,
    compositions stalked by not-quite-there vocals. It's a universal feeling if
    geography is any indication. In Northern California, the duo Brightblack
    Morning Light make music fit for drowning in; in Baltimore, Beach House ply
    their own hazy trade; and in Chicago, Califone murmur and strum. Benoît
    Pioulard, the nom de guerre of Michigan multi-instrumentalist Thomas Meluch,
    might belong here too: he has the same insular hum, the same repetitive song
    craft, the same lazy pace. But <em>Précis</em>, at heart, is a striver record:
    one that can't leave you alone.</p><p>
    Much has been made of the idiot savant quality of Pioulard's first release.
    Burnished by a home tapes legend, where his intimate songs were passed, we're
    meant to believe, via cassette and CD-R into so many enlightened bedrooms,
    Benoît Pioulard has already been hailed as a master romantic, arriving on scene
    with a record that belies his supposed inexperience. At first blush, <em>Précis</em>
    is all of that: evocative, nostalgic, romantic, intimate. As his beautifully
    simple chord progressions tumble out, they erase their prior referents; moments
    of beauty on ""Ext. Leslie Park"" or ""Ash Into The Sky"" are
    sharp, pointed, returning like cathected memories.</p><p>
    In this, Meluch's music is sometimes reminiscent less of the Basinki
    tape-loops and Boards of Canada ambiance that he often cites as influences than
    of a more maudlin, if incandescent, inspiration: Elliott Smith. Like Smith,
    Meluch's method of getting into your head is to coo into your ear. The
    high-gloss pathos that infect ""Triggering Back"",
    ""Palimend"", and ""Hirondelle""-- half the album, really--
    have that same already-decided emotional charge to them that infiltrated Smith's
    work. Catch you on rainy day, or one where your girl or guy left, and these
    songs might make you weep. Otherwise, all you'll hear is naked effort.

    As a craftsman of <em>sound</em>, Pioulard is as compositionally solid as Max
    Richter or as playfully complex as Mark Mothersbaugh. His cluttered, dense
    mixes are what he truly has in common with the Califones and Brightblacks of
    the world. And yet there it is again, that insistent vocal croon, demanding
    your attention in every spot where the rest of his mix plays hands-off. The
    cracked warble of his intermediate and transitional tracks-- ""Moth
    Wings"", ""Corpus Chant"", and ""La Guerre de Sept Ans""--
    have a depth and transistor-crackle beauty to them that no anxiously
    confessional vocal can touch. These are where Meluch's strengths lie: between
    and amongst the layers, in the dead time. And yet we're treated to song after
    song. Who needs another auteur?

    With the long-delayed, viciously imagined <em>Hell
    Hath No Fury</em>, Clipse-- hip-hop's meanest, smartest duo-- have done what a gathering collection of internet seekers, record-store goers, and street corner mixtape shoppers hoped they might: release a classic. With musical partners the Neptunes, Clipse have crafted 12 unrelenting tales of desperation and
    distribution, glamour and gloating. Lyrically, the album is spare and incisive-- wordplay abounds
    but the punches are quick and devastating-- and musically, Malice and Pusha T have
    arguably snatched the best dozen Neptunes tracks in years. Together,
    the quartet has crafted an album that's sonically deep, dark, and
    one of 2006's finest.</p><p>
    An unforgivable mean streak powers this album, which is no surprise considering the endlessly documented label
    drama Clipse have endured, and the ascetic rage that courses through their
    music. Push and Mal spent much of their lauded 2005 mixtape, <em>We Got
    It 4 Cheap Vol. 2</em>, elucidating both their
    ethical and financial dealings: They were cold-blooded, joyous, and morally
    complex all at once. But the subject matter remained mostly street talk--
    deals, slang, stunting-- with dabs of glitz tossed in. This album isn't about
    cocaine <em>per se</em>; it's the aftershock of a coke sale-infused existence. The
    results spray everywhere, from the vacant spending spree of ""Dirty Money"" to
    the terrifyingly earned braggadocio of ""Trill"". This is lifestyle assertion,
    not something as negligible and confined as drug music.</p><p>
    The two men in the
    middle of it all are brilliant at nearly every turn. The younger Thornton
    brother, Pusha, remains star and stylist, brazenly dishing on minor details
    like his sunglasses (""Louis V Millionaires to kill the glare"") while injecting
    a malevolent, almost maniacal intensity to his verses. His elder brother, Malice, is the vulnerable antecedent, not
    without floss but more leaning on family and fraternity: ""Grandma,
    look at me, I'm turnin' the other cheek,"" he laments on ""We Got It For Cheap
    (Intro)"". Their rhyme patterns aren't overwhelmingly technical; Pusha rhymes straightforward syllables without tangling his syntax into a
    jumbled hush-mutter. (Jay-Z, take note: Sometimes directness is a blessing.)
    </p>
<p>
    And,
    as if the sniping slow burn of lead single ""Mr. Me Too"" wasn't enough notice, Clipse are
    self-contained entities, seemingly uninfluenced by their contemporaries. Occasionally they recall
    duos of the past-- EPMD's playfulness, Outkast's willingness to attempt the
    unconventional, Mobb Deep's unerring rancor-- but they're true only to their
    sound, a simmering executioner's song. Rarely explicitly violent, their blistering
    conviction feels like carnage on ""What It Do (Wamp Wamp)""-- Malice even compares
    himself to the genocidal Hutu tribe on the track. It confirms their
    unjustifiable relishing of moral decay, and while it's impossible to comprehend or condone, the
    energy and flair is undeniable. 
    </p>
<p>
    All that said, the Neptunes' mystifying, irregular sonics further elevate the record. When
    the drum sounds are light and chimey, the surrounding melodies sound sinister
    and serpentine. Otherwise that formula is completely flipped, as doorknocker
    snares often accompany spacious arrangements. It's an interesting juxtaposition-- fitting the furious and odd against bubbly and blissful-- but this is what
    the Neptunes have always done best (think Noreaga's ""Superthug"" or Kelis'
    ""Milkshake""). Accordions, steel pan drums, harps, distorted synths, cowbell-- Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo throw everything at Clipse. (One assumes Hugo,
    whose work has leaned toward the dark and spare in the past, had a large hand
    in this album.) ""Trill"" and ""Ride Around Shining"" in particular are monstrous,
    freakishly beautiful constructions. ""Trill"" surrounds you with its blown-out
    bass sound while the tense harp plucks of ""Ride"", posed against clipped groans and a single straining high note, are both fractured and
    gorgeous.
    </p>
<p>
    But what's perhaps most important here is that <em>Hell Hath No Fury</em> is
    uncompromising music: Delayed more than three years and pushed into some
    unclear anticipation vortex, Clipse still refused to make concessions. The one ballad,
    ""Nightmares"", featuring Bilal, is long and morose and ragged, while the
    frothiest ditty is about spending drug money on expensive shoes. Clipse make
    street music, so the more unlikely members of their fanbase-- hipsters, bloggers, students-- might seem perplexing. Of course, their wit and verve, always touched by a
    hint of self-loathing, connects with most anyone who's done any wrong in their
    life. Living with yourself can be a tricky thing, and for Clipse, that's now truer
    than ever.

    Brothers is tough-- it's a story that goes in fits and starts and doesn't stay on
    one path for long. Their three members weren't named Walker,
    and they weren't brothers. They were American, but hit it big after moving to
    swinging London
    and subsequently becoming a part of the British Invasion. They made their most
    challenging music three albums into a completely unexpected mid-1970s reunion.
    They're sometimes viewed as an anachronism in the London of Carnaby Street,
    UFO, Indica Books, and the <em>International
    Times</em>, and yet at the time  they sold records by the boatload.</p><p>
    There's some truth to the anachronism view-- I keep trying to
    picture them touring with Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and the Soft Machine, but the
    image won't come. There's something about their intensely dramatic (sometimes
    melodramatic) music, orchestral formalism, and triple-threat heartthrob image
    that just doesn't jibe with beat and psychedelia. Perhaps that's why their
    music largely avoids sounding dated to its 1965-1967 time frame. That's not to
    say it sounds modern, either-- very few artists make records like this anymore-- but it's
    certainly not tied up with 60s counter-culture associations.</p><p>
    Covering more than 100 tracks (13 previously unissued)
    over five discs, <em>Everything Under the Sun</em>
    is true to its name, bringing together all of the Walkers' material, from
    Scott's early, awkward exhortations to ""do the jerk"" to his first forays into
    bizarro world on 1978's <em>Nite Flights</em>
    LP. If nothing else, this proves that their music is more than just hors
    d'oeuvre for Scott Walker's solo career. There are throwaway tracks all over
    the place, sure, but there are small masterpieces as well, and there's immense
    talent on display nearly everywhere.
    </p><p>
    Scott Engel, John Maus, and Gary Leeds originally came
    together in L.A.,
    where all three had been session players since the early 60s. In early,
    pre-Leeds bands with Maus, Engel mostly wanted to play bass and barely sang at
    all. Early sessions with Jack Nietzsche at the boards changed that-- Engel's
    voice was simply too spectacular to keep hidden. That voice-- so rich and
    sonorous, naturally stuffed with gravitas-- is in the lead on most of the songs
    on this box, and it's obvious why. 
    </p>
<p>
    The Walkers' material splits neatly into two phases, each
    with three albums: the original 60s act and the 70s reunion. Singles and B-sides throw the balance of material to the 60s, and it's interesting to hear
    them hit and miss in the early going. Their take on Bacharach/David's ""Make It
    Easy on Yourself"" is the height of majesty in pop music, with Ivor Raymonde's
    swirling string arrangement and Scott's soaring lead vocal. But it's surrounded
    by lousy versions of ""Dancing in the Street"" and ""Land of 1,000 Dances"" (who <em>didn't</em> play that song in 1965?), and the
    amusing Engel-penned ""Do the Jerk"", a song that's light years from the literary ballads he'd one day make his stock in trade. 
    </p>
<p>
    At this point, all three Walkers were ravenous for stardom,
    but it didn't take too many chaotic shows or invasions of privacy for Scott to
    tire of being a pop icon. ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore"", which appears
    here in three slightly different versions, was their supernova moment, grabbing
    the UK
    #1 spot for four straight weeks, and after that it was simply a matter of time
    before the split, though it thankfully wouldn't come for two more years. The
    group's second album, 1966's <em>Portrait</em>,
    is excellent and surprisingly dark. ""In My Room"" opens it with a blast of
    apocalyptic trumpet, while ""Hurting Each Other"" nearly equals the drama of ""The
    Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore.""
    </p>
<p>
    ""Saturday's Child"" and Engel's ""Living Above Your Head"" are
    charged forays into rock, but it's on two non-album tracks that Scott really
    flexes his muse. ""Archangel"" is ominous, with
    blaring, almost abrasive church organ, while ""Mrs. Murphy"", not coincidentally
    from the <em>Solo John Solo Scott</em> EP,
    anticipates the vivid character studies like ""Big Louise"" that littered his
    first five solo albums. Their third album, <em>Images</em>,
    teeters between beautiful, jazz-inflected orchestral ballads like the
    Scott-sung ""Once Upon a Summertime"" and borderline schmaltz, like the
    Scott-written Tex-Mex tune ""Experience"". 
    ""Orpheus"" sounds like it would have fit on <em>Scott</em>, though, and Maus' ""I Wanna Know"" even makes a half-stab
    into fuzz-rock territory with some success. 
    </p>
<p>
    And that was it for the Walker Brothers, or so it seemed.
    Discs four and five in this set pick up the thread in the mid-70s, when the
    band quite spontaneously reunited (Leeds simply called Engel one day and
    asked if he'd be up for getting back together). Though they experienced a bit
    of chart success early in the reunion, this remains a fairly unknown musical
    chapter, coming as it did after Scott's initial burst of solo creativity had
    waned and the other two had been far from the public eye for years. The first
    two albums, 1975's <em>No Regrets</em> and
    1976's <em>Lines</em>, basically update the
    band's 60s aesthetic for the 70s-- dryer sound, more subdued orchestration,
    guitar solos, a generally smoother feel, and even a little reggae influence, of
    all things. 
    </p>
<p>
    Those first two reunion records consist entirely of covers,
    and while they have their moments-especially the title track of <em>No Regrets</em>, a Tom Rush cover, and the
    r&amp;b-soaked take on ""Burn our Bridges""-- they don't sound especially inspired
    either, often static, blandly rocking or, at worst, cloying and treacly. It's
    the last eleven tracks on this set, comprising the album <em>Nite Flights</em> and the cast-off instrumental ""Tokyo Rimshot"" that
    redeem the group's second phase. These songs-- two written by Leeds, four by Maus
    and five by Engel-- are post-punk in all but name, and Engel's are downright
    shocking, as far away on the pop spectrum from the simpering of ""Lovers"" and
    the generic rock of ""First Day"" and ""Have You Seen My Baby"" as possible.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Death of Romance"" makes it sound like Leeds
    had been listening to a lot of Roxy Music, while his ""Den Haague"" ads weird
    microtonal percussion to its skinny-tie funk. Maus' songs work in similar
    prog-funk territory, but the work of both men feels firmly rooted to the 70s,
    where Engel's songs sound like they come from a parallel universe, firmly
    pointing the way toward <em>Climate of Hunter</em>,
    <em>Tilt</em> and <em>the Drift</em>. ""Shutout"" is mind-scorching avant-disco topped with a
    counter-intuitively catchy vocal and wickedly amelodic guitar. I can't imagine
    being a fan of ""No Regrets"" and getting kicked four-square in the face with the
    sour robo-funk of ""Fat Mama Kick"", much less ""The Electrician"" a harrowing,
    dissonant six-minute journey into the part of Scott Engel's brain that keeps
    him up nights, interrupted by a lush orchestral explosion. This was Scott
    Walker emerging completely from his shell, never to return.
    </p>
<p>
    That the Walker Brothers should go out on such an
    unexpectedly cutting-edge note hardly seems out of place given their history as
    a whole. If there's a real arc to their story, it's probably that they were
    never fully in step with what was happening around them, but made it work for
    them. This box tells the whole story in music, and includes a generously
    illustrated book that nevertheless focuses on the Walkers together, leaving out
    the portions of the story that happened before, after and in between their two stints
    together. All of the <em>No Regrets</em> and <em>Lines</em> albums might be a little too much
    to own for the average person, but this is a great all-in-one-place collection for
    big fans of the brothers and solo Scott as well.

    Providence, Rhode Island's Brother Kite make music that floats, tethered to
    the ground by the thinnest of strings. Their music glows a bit as well, in the
    same way a cloud or a contrail glows at sunset, bright at the edges with a
    sober-hued core. The shoegazer tag will be misapplied to them, if it hasn't
    been already, even though the imperfect label that suits them better is
    probably power pop. Sure, their songs are coated in big sheets of guitar and
    synth, but at their heart they have more in common with Superdrag (especially
    in the vocals) and Teenage Fanclub than Ride or My Bloody Valentine.</p><p>
<em>Waiting for the Time to Be Right</em>, the band's second album, is nicely
    balanced, flowing with ease from gigantic ballads to sugar-spiked,
    double-tracked vocals stacked on quick beats that sound like something Brian
    Wilson might have dreamed up if his musical resources had been limited to
    guitars and reverb. ""The Coat of Arms"" kicks the record off with a
    three-minute instrumental intro. It's a rush of thoroughly blended guitar and
    synth that boils itself down to a simple organ figure as the drums retreat. The
    first vocals you hear drift in the echo as they gradually build-- like the
    instrumental section-- into a swirl of harmonies.</p><p>
    The feel comes back on the title track, where the guitars and drums are held
    back for nearly two minutes. When they do come in, the drums are huge, blowing
    the song out to widescreen proportions. It's followed by ""Hold Me
    Down"", a song on overdrive for nearly all of its four and a half minutes,
    guitars jangling madly for a texture that nearly overflows with sound-- this is
    actually rare on the record, as most of the songs course between dynamic
    extremes of fullness and starkness. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Lay Down Your Burden"" is almost violent about dynamic shifts,
    sweeping away its quietest moments with drum rolls, sheets of reverb and
    luminous harmonies, as though the band is reaching for some goal miles overhead
    it knows it can't reach, but has to try for anyway. It's beautiful stuff. The
    Brother Kite's formula computes most incredibly on ""Out of Sight"", a
    song that teases you with unexpectedly dark chord changes the first few times
    you're sure it's going to explode, and just when you've accepted that it will
    stay subdued, it modulates and heads skyward of the backs of chiming,
    harmonized guitars. The vocal melody aches-- it's a pop song played as large as
    a pop song can sound. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's not all as blissful as that, but <em>Waiting for the Time to Be Right</em>
    has more than enough wow moments to make it worth listening to over and over.
    ""The sky's the limit"" has been an outdated expression ever since
    Sputnik, and it's records like this that remind us that the cliché's
    obsolescence extends to music as well. The Brother Kite slip right past the sky
    on their guitars and into low orbit here, and it's a pleasure to join them
    there.

    To prevent (or provoke)
    reader mail crying foul, let me state right up front that I think Kidz in the
    Hall-- Naledge and Double-O-- are great guys. I like them. We would probably
    get along and have things to talk about. They both graduated from the
    University of Pennsylvania, a fine school. They are both committed to being
    positive role models in the community, hip-hop and otherwise. They both have a
    love and a gift for music that is undeniable. I think it's great that they are
    getting the opportunity to resurrect a once great independent label, Rawkus
    Records. I think it's great that super-producer Just Blaze thinks they're
    great. I am totally happy for Kidz in the Hall, and if they succeed, I will
    raise a glass in their honor. Now, take a deep breath, because none of that
    makes this a great record. If kids start reading, crime rates drop, race and
    gender relations improve, and the sky clears all due to <em>School Was My Hustle</em>,
    I will be stoked, but I won't feel obligated to change my mind.</p><p>
    What Naledge and Double-O represent, and what they are
    asking of us, is nothing new. Every time the bad guys sell lots of records, we
    get a good guy movement. Native Tongues were fed up with gangsta rappers. Old
    Rawkus was a response to Bad Boy and Death Row. And Kidz in the Hall, on the
    new Rawkus, are offering an alternative to current trends. The difference is
    that Native Tongues' De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, and
    Leaders of the New School and Rawkus groups like Company Flow and Black Star
    were offering something new, something equally as exciting as their counterparts.
    A real alternative. They made records that, if you were looking for a reason to
    like rap, again or at all, you could get behind because they were weird or
    funny or both, but always intelligent. What we get from Naledge and Double-O is
    a record that wants to be that but doesn't know how. It's tentative, guarded
    and self-conscious, and relies too much on bringing something back (i.e.
    ""real hip-hop"") instead of bringing something different.</p><p>
    Naledge can definitely rap, and Double-O chops a nice
    sample. But their songs are all brains and no heart. The two best examples of
    this are the single ""Go Ill"" and ""Don't Stop"", a song with
    an almost identical beat to Jay-Z's recent and ubiquitous ""Show Me What
    You Got"". The former, a nice little slab of blaxploitation funk with a
    flinty flute loop, features Naledge telling his (or someone's) tale of life on
    the streets of South Side Chicago. After all the business of being an Ivy League
    rapper, he offers nothing more than rote images of drinking and fucking. Yeah,
    smart kids drink and fuck too, but that's not what he's talking about. His
    story is no different than the thousands of dum-dums before him. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Don't Stop"", on the other hand, provides a
    stark example of why Naledge is not on the level of your favorite rapper. Because
    Double-O let his buddy Just Blaze steal his beat, Naledge is caught out in a
    blizzard of better verses. The list of rappers who have already destroyed Jay-Z
    on this beat is arm's length, and unfortunately for Naledge, he's below Jay on
    that list. It's a production that demands breathless energy or ridiculous
    bravado, and you can barely hear Naledge on it. And when you do, it's something
    like, ""Niggas talkin' out they ass and still not sayin' shit."" C'mon,
    Penn English Department! 
    </p>
<p>
    But that's the running
    issue with <em>School Was My Hustle</em>: There's little evidence that school was
    actually their hustle. Naledge doesn't talk about it in any great detail, and
    Double-O could have just as easily honed his Just Blaze Jr. impression in Just
    Blaze's studio. Save your parents some money, dudes. Because if the lesson here
    is that school is an alternative to crime as a way out of the streets, then
    shouldn't Naledge be talking about how great college was? Keggers, co-ed dorms,
    pretentious philosophy majors, eh, co-ed dorms. It seems like a missed
    opportunity, especially considering Kanye's recent successes in flaunting
    ignorance. He's what your professor might have called a ""strawman,""
    perfect for making wildly entertaining generalizations about stuff. Again, I
    don't have any problem with Ivy League graduates making a rap record instead of
    using their degrees to get a real job. I just wish that they'd used their Ivy
    League degrees to make a better rap record.

    You've heard Summer Hymns' new album before. Maybe not the record itself, but the elements are familiar: the gentleness of Danielson Famile's quiet moments, the gushing sentimentality of recent Flaming Lips, the vocal
    affectations of recent Mercury Rev, and the kind of driftless, meandering melodies that never seem to go much of anywhere.</p><p>
    If what I just described nails down what you look for and enjoy in music, <em>Backward
    Masks</em> is probably right up your alley. If not, run, because this might be the most
    alarmingly tedious indie release of the year. The band's previous albums were infused with more Elephant 6-brand whimsy-- child-like vocals, manic instrumentation, brassy Beach Boys rip-offs, you know the drill-- and weren't so hushed or maudlin, nor half as predictable. <em>Backward Masks</em>, on the other hand, takes itself much more seriously. Acoustic instrumentation
    casts long shadows of reverb behind a voice that creaks with earnestness like a
    balsa-wood levee. The tempo never rises above a plod, and the mood never veers
    into anything so visceral as hate, anger, giddiness, distaste, or mild
    discomfort.</p><p>
    The
    double-tracked vocals of ""Fearanoia"" are, as usual, vaguely reminiscent of the
    Beach Boys, and the horns layered over the double-time outro (speeding it up from
    ""beach cruiser"" to ""Rascal"") in ""Start Swimming""
    quicken the pulse ever so slightly. But <em>Backward Masks</em> is so petrified of taking risks that even the few surprises, like the wandering fuzz-bass in
    opener ""Way You Walk"", are mired in a suffocating blanket of forced agreeability.
    The song is otherwise rote with the conventions of cuddle-rock, without even a
    sharp lyric here or there to help elevate it above the mundane.
    </p>
<p>
    Instead, singer Zachary Gresham
    wants to ""love you in the most beautiful ways"" because ""there's
    no reason to be afraid of love."" Also, he's ""traded [his] contacts for Hulk<em></em>-colored contacts"" which make
    everything ""livid green"" (obviously). Later, he's led to the realization that ""baseball sucks
    and so does life/ I'm going on strike,"" but barring that, he'll join his
    friend who, ""like a monkey,"" is ""waiting for evolution to come
    on your little head."" 
    </p>
<p>
    It's to the point where I don't even blame the band. I
    just want to punch Wayne Coyne with a big pink fist for making this sap so viable
    for other musicians. I've typed ""pleasant"" and replaced it with
    synonyms so many times it doesn't even look like a word to me anymore.
    Spare me sunny warm-weather correlatives; put me in a hammock, spin it into a
    cocoon, and just light the fucker on fire. I'm choking on the summertime
    haze.

    survey Swan Lake, opting instead in our reviews, as the act does in its
    songs, to isolate and juxtapose-- and then to isolate by
    juxtaposition-- loaded fragments, pleas, and images. Because holy hell,
    <em>Beast Moans</em> establishes a high that will likely inspire mimicry
    in its listeners. You'll be jotting down phrases that you hear
    throughout your day as if they were signs from the universe, just as
    this album's relentless reverb, sustain, and vibrato suggest that an
    act of creation is merely a series of echoes.</p><p>
    Swan Lake is of course a Supergroup McSideproject of folks already
    equipped with supergroups and side projects. Like the best work of its
    participants, <em>Beast Moans</em>
    is no pornographer's rubdown; it delivers on its tease. The Dan
    Bejar/Spencer Krug/Carey Mercer triple-team performs spirographic
    sprints around, say, Amalgamated Sons of Rest, the 2003 Will
    Oldham/Jason Molina/Alasdair Roberts gangwarble. In the event that you
    are an anxious consolidator of last.fm stats trying to weed out fluke
    acts, you might switch ""Swan Lake"" to ""Destroyer"" in the artist-blank
    and not totally be lying, since Frog Eyes have already backed Dan
    Bejar, and Bejar's preoccupations seem to win the album's field day: ""A
    Venue Called Rubella"", as the title hints, plays like an outtake from <em>Rubies</em> (okay, like a trippy, prancing alternate take of ""3000 Flowers"") and its lyrical shout-out to <em>Streethawk</em> continues Bejar's habit of mythologizing his own discography, which he, um, continues via ""The Freedom""'s repine for <em>City of Daughters</em>.</p><p>
    Each performer gets a star turn on <em>Beast Moans</em>, and ""The
    Freedom"" is Bejar's; it's basically a Destroyer anthem, which means
    that it's made of pieces of countless other people's anthems, but
    boasting stunner lyrics and a chorus about much more than Swan Lake yet
    still about Swan Lake: ""The freedom to be alone with the freedom""
    addresses not having to share, and this album's whole experiment is to
    approach fellowship as a formal constraint. When Bejar, Krug, and
    Mercer fade into each other, as they do on ""City Calls"" and ""Pleasure
    Vessels"", a magical fourth man's marrow seems to arise from the psych
    blandishments and obscure passion. Several other tracks even suggest
    that they were striving to become male, analog-ambient, goth-scatting
    Cocteau Triplets, using rock's la's, da's, ah's, ooh's, oh's, and
    whoah's (with a dash of Nintendo) to speak in tongues, structuring
    careful laments that impersonate unfettered lamentations.
    </p><p>
    That great not-American source of American imagery, the Bible, is
    responsible for a shocking number of lines. Also unexpected are the
    earthbound love songs. Equally freshening is how many tracks are
    woman-centric, although who knows if all of these sisters, daughters,
    mothers, widows, ""Pollenated Girls"", and lovers have actual referents
    or are just radiant furniture in a cosmology of longing. The fabulous
    Krug-led fable ""All Fires"" best blends the album's conceits, as a wife
    loses a daughter, a church is torn apart, Eve's origin is invoked, and
    a Theresa gets the mother/saint/martyr treatment.
    </p>
<p>
    Pretending to discuss the lyrics is a sad surrender, though, because
    anyone attempting to decode them is going to lose the songwriters'
    rigged game of ""guess which finger I'm holding up behind the tapestry.""
    The album's swathy textures deserve as much credit as the vocal shrieks
    for making its pomp and mystery so enjoyable. The lazy-susan approach
    to antic and mellow tones, the blend of trad-strumming with a panicked,
    not-altogether-Western approach to guitar, the shifts from church
    organs to carnival organs, and the unpredictable percussion combine to
    suggest that with <em>Beast Moans</em>,
    these yelpy brainiacs have cornered their collective animal. The
    album's thesislessness and almost-annoying beauty earn spittoonfuls of
    odd gratitude.

    Hey, guys, you know what?</p><p>
    Damien Rice is pretty much the vanguard of the avant-garde: a <em>Bladerunner</em>-snazzy digital billboard beckoning toward a brave, new, post-emotional future. Sure, the canny Irish <em>artiste</em> may have fooled a lot of people into thinking his ostensible watered-down coffeehouse troubadour shtick was boring enough to win a Shortlist Prize, but a few of us know better. Maybe you're saying I'm full of shit: maybe you can't actually <em>hear</em> the new sound of the 21st century because you're still so busy half-listening to the first 30 seconds of the latest ""leaked"" indie album, breathlessly registering your online approval in comment boxes between ritual visits to goatse.cx.</p><p>
    Look, you've heard of the non-denial denial, right? ""I have no recollection of that."" OK, good, 'cause more recently, the non-apology apology has been sweeping the globe: ""I will apologize to Michael J. Fox, <em>if I am wrong</em>."" Don't bogart that Vicodin, Mr. Limbaugh. And now Rice, a confessional singer/songwriter, alone in the whole world except for fellow avant-gardist and would-be author O.J. Simpson, has pioneered the next communications vogue: The non-confession confession. Simpson's book, <em>If I Did It</em>, has been scuttled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. just days before its expected street date; Rice's sophomore album, <em>9</em>, is already out and changes everything. 
    </p>
<p>
    The confessional singer/songwriter's main charge has always been, O tautology of tautologies, to confess. His tales of woe may be tragically real (Elliott Smith) or borne out of a self-mythologized folkie past (early Bob Dylan), but the broken-heart-on-bloodied-sleeve breed of performer exists to make you feel his pain, babe. Still, no professional fink has ever been so explicit as to begin a record with a song called ""9 Crimes""-- nor ever kept so fuzzy about what those crimes actually are. Yes, on <em>9</em>, Rice makes a lot of mellow noise about being a liar, a cheat, and an all-around gloomy Gus, but his disclosures are usually too trite, his offenses too vague, ever to really ring true, and the songs' assembly-line construction subverts any emotional impact. It's as if Rice has conjured up every cliché from the genre's past, only to immolate them all in a tepid MOR bonfire. Far fucking out. 
    </p>
<p>
    A somber duet with band member Lisa Hannigan, ""9 Crimes"" doesn't just conveniently explain the album's title. It also introduces Rice's bland template: First, intone a few faded metaphors so unrelentingly bleak they must be sincere; rotate through a few ghostly arpeggios, either on piano or acoustic guitar (every few songs, actually <em>strum</em>!); build from faltering Jeff Buckley whispers to cathartic Jeff Buckley caterwauls; let the strings swell, and...Congratulations, you're on satellite radio. Rice murmurs, ""It's a small crime, and I got no excuse,"" then adds something about a loaded gun. First time I heard this was in a movie theater before <em>Borat</em>. Trivia: Russell Crowe's pre-stardom nom de rock was, oh man, Russ Le Roq! 
    </p>
<p>
    No bears in ice cream vans here. Rice mostly keeps this Lexus LS 400 in cruise control. Oh, occasionally he'll wax meta-- from ""You asked me to write you a pleasant song"" to ""What's the point of this song?"" in just two tracks-- and sometimes he gets deep: ""Nothing is lost/ It is just frozen in frost."" Mostly, though, he's unremittingly melancholy, making sure never to use the word ""end"" when ""die"" will do. ""9 Crimes"" has already been tapped for <em>Grey's Anatomy</em>, but the closest Rice comes to a future sleeper hit is the laid-back ""Dogs"", with an agrammatical, non-rhyming chorus about ""the girl that does yoga/ when we come over"" and an overall sense of Dave Matthewsy lasciviousness. Whenever Rice risks truly touching us emotionally-- say, when he's asking a former lover, ""Do you brush your teeth before you kiss?"" on ""Accidental Babies""-- he undercuts himself with go-nowhere melodies and formulaic arrangements. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are a few times throughout <em>9</em> when Rice boldly ignores the fact that his chain-ready inoffensiveness is a major reason for his appeal (this is called an Elizabeth Berkley). ""I am lately horny,"" Rice bellows on the meandering ""Elephant"" after hissing like Thom Yorke at the end of an old ""Creep"" acoustic version. And that's only the start. With usual soft/loud dynamic, ""Rootless Tree"" drifts from middle-aged guitar harmonics (a dozing Keller Williams?) to adolescent alterna-angst: ""Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,"" goes the lazy chorus, a funhouse-mirror obliteration of all that was affecting in Ani DiFranco's confessional singer/songwriter standard, ""Untouchable Face"". Rice assaults his coffeehouse milieu aurally, as well as lyrically: With its ""my god!"" squeals and sadistic, quasi-arty distortion, ""Me, My Yoke, and I"" is a break from the Rice mold-- and helped me finally identify with <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>. Forgive him, dudes, for he know not what he do. 
    </p>
<p>
    Now, OK, you're saying, but didn't Rice actually <em>do</em> all this before on <em>O</em>, the award-winning 2002 debut that went platinum in Ireland and has soundtracked stateside TV dramas ever since? Not quite. Sure, <em>O</em> was a study in earnestness-by-numbers so unimaginative it could've been self-parody, but it did offer a few resolutely tuneful moments: ubiquitous first single ""The Blower's Daughter"", bedroom cello ember ""Volcano"", or the keening but catchy ""Cannonball"" and its adult-alternative remix. Like the Juice's <em>If I Did It</em>, Rice's <em>9</em> renders past transgressions merely hypothetical. This album promises nine crimes, but at 10 tracks, it's actually a bargain. Hints, allegations, and things left unsaid.

    he had to teach some of the local musicians to navigate the unfamiliar
    minor keys of his tricky songs. White man's burden be damned-- that may
    make Simon the first person in the world to openly boast of bringing
    sadness to Africa.</p><p>
    Not that South Africans, or millions of other Africans, didn't have
    plenty of reasons of their own to be sad. That holds particularly true
    for those in the Congo, who for hundreds of years suffered through not
    just slavery but the misguided colonialist policies of Europe. But if
    there was a silver lining to this misery, it was the subsequent rise of
    the Congolese rumba, one of the most genial and universal of African's
    many vibrant forms of music.</p><p>
    For that, as the helpful liner notes of <em>Roots of Rumba Rock: Congo Classics 1953-1955</em>
    point out, we can thank the fruits of cross-pollination. Just as the
    arrival of slaves in the Caribbean helped birth both Cuban son and
    bossa nova, among other strains of Latin music, so did the roundabout
    return of these musical mutations to Kinshasa (then still Leopoldville) help
    explain the evolution of rumba in the heart of the Belgian Congo. Add
    to that the Belgian <em>laissez-faire</em> attitude toward the natives'
    various entertainments and it wasn't long before the people's music
    radiated outward as truly pop music.
    </p><p>
    The rumbas, beguines and other dance music variations on <em>Roots of
    Rumba Rock</em> (originally recorded for the Loningisa label) lay out a lot
    of the template still being adapted and altered by current Congolese
    acts. The frenetic pluck and plink of thumb pianos drive De Malo's
    ""Towuti Brazza Toye Kisasa"", while the early Solovox synthesizer
    provides some of the winsome melody in De Wayon's ""Nalekaki Na Nzela"".
    Elsewhere, distortion artfully finds its way into the compositions.
    Several tracks from early pioneers like Bowane are included, while
    ""Bana Bosenge"" represents the same circle of unemployed street
    performers who would later give us pan-African rumba star Franco.
    </p>
<p>
    So does it rock? Well, no, not really. You have to be pretty
    sharp-eared to pick out the relatively unusual intrusions of such rock
    signifiers as electric guitar or piano. But (and back to those liners)
    the two discs of songs collected here do represent a certain form of
    rock and roll rebellion, namely fun in the face of oppression. These
    upbeat tunes generally tackle light subjects like romantic foibles and
    getting drunk (as well as the occasional paeans to women's rights), and
    if the music is quaint compared to the congotronics outbursts Crammed
    Discs has compiled elsewhere, you can definitely hear its influence
    coursing through contemporary Congolese music.
    </p>
<p>
    In fact, though the recording quality dates the music, the songs
    themselves sound as timeless as they are joyful, underscoring this
    comp's place as a sort of African music Rosetta Stone. It's
    simultaneously an indirect reminder of the hardships imposed on so many
    Africans while a spirited reminder that for many of those same people,
    music represented the ultimate escape from weighty woes.

    To understand Jan St. Werner's work as Lithops, it helps to be familiar with
    Sonig, the label he started in 1997 with Frank Dommert. Sonig releases a
    certain amount of accessible music, such as Jason Forrest's noisy mash-up <em>The
    Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post Disco Crash </em>and Nathan Michel's <em>The Beast</em>.
    But they also regularly explore the outer limits of listenability, from
    suites for analog squiggles by Michel Waisvisz to free improv Game Boy
    experiments by the Fan Club Orchestra. For Lithops, as for his label, St.
    Werner is interested in examining the boundaries of what can be considered
    music, walking the borders between playfulness and violence, seeing what lies
    beyond the threshold of annoyance. The experimental nature of this approach
    means some Sonig releases sound like nothing else out there; it also means
    that a good chunk of the catalog is something you'll put on very rarely.</p><p>
    Here on his fourth full-length solo release, the Lithops project is more multifaceted
    than ever. Early records like <em>Didot</em> and <em>Uni Umit</em> worked in a
    realm similar to where Mouse on Mars was at the time, compressing the main gig's
    pop experiments into short, crude, and often humorous nuggets. But <em>Scrypt</em>,
    released in 2003, found St. Werner veering into abstraction of almost
    incomprehensible density, every corner stuffed with jagged digital distortion
    that took many listens to dissect. <em>Mound Magnet </em>sometimes heads for <em>Scrypt</em>'s
    noisy hills, but it also makes room for more buoyant moments.</p><p>
    Tracks like ""Opposite of Windward"" and ""Vortext"" aren't
    easy listens, with the former's extreme surges in dynamics, machinegun tempo,
    and rapidly crisscrossing layers of abrasive synths, and the latter's harsh
    metallic whine that serves as the central motif. But these are <em>Mound Magnet</em>'s
    highlights, exhibiting St. Werner's original and highly developed musical
    language. All sorts of spazzy IDM in the late 1990s strove for this level of
    quick-cut abrasion, but St. Werner exhibits patience and refinement, letting
    the songs unfold in a logical manner despite the harshness. These tracks also
    hint at why Mouse on Mars' <em>Varcharz </em>may have been better off jettisoning
    its half-hearted pop aspirations, foregoing beats in favor of pure texture. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Cephalopod"", ""Peek"", ""Harpoon Point"", and
    ""Stratografic"" are prickly, off-kilter tunes with chords and
    melodies, regular beats, and vague hints of dub; all impress with their
    inventive approach. Though these are electronic instrumentals in some way
    connected to pop history, they're not easily pegged to any one era and seem in
    no way retro. They are in that sense an honest go at creating a warped and
    challenging future music, fulfilling some of the promise of an original spirit
    of IDM.
    </p>
    And
    yet, listening to these bouncy numbers, I'm reminded of Lithops'
    ""Me We"". This track was St. Werner's contribution to the 1999 label
    sampler <em>Comp.</em>, Sonig's first CD release after a number of vinyl issues.
    ""Me We"" is short, weird, terribly catchy, and hilarious, a unique pop
    instrumental that comes over as a cheap re-write of an 80s cop movie theme
    updated with late-90s computing power. St. Werner's projects tended toward the
    whimsical and humorous then; they were unassuming and approachable even when
    they seemed they could turn in any direction next. St. Werner's current
    aesthetic has traveled some distance from those days, and though <em>Mound
    Magnet </em>certainly succeeds on its own terms, I can't help but pine for the
    old mischievousness.</div>"|9614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9614-mound-magnet/|7.2|Mark Richardson

    his friends farted around in a modest alt.country group called the Scud
    Mountain Boys. The story goes that the quartet would sit around the
    kitchen table with their instruments and write and play their songs.
    After two self-released albums, they hit the big time (relatively
    speaking) with the Sub Pop-supported <em>Massachusetts</em>, a slow and
    somber effort featuring often beautiful songs about boxers, ottomans,
    and liquor stores. It ended up being the group's final effort-- Joe
    hooked up with his bro and some other folks, started up the Pernice
    Brothers to scratch his pop itch, and found himself growing amenable to
    that sort of scratching. Out of the bucket of tunes Pernice and his
    pals wrote around the kitchen table as Scud studs, only one song has
    found an afterlife with the Brothers; after years as a staple of the
    Pernice Brothers live show, it's finally been rerecorded. It might not
    be the sort of new life the song wants, though.</p><p>
    Originally, ""Grudge F***"" was an arena-sized mono-ironic AM-radio
    ballad trapped in a spindly acoustic shell. Pernice's earnest mewling
    on this track might recall ""You Light Up My Life"" or any Olivia
    Newton-John tearjerker, except that you'd never hear those lovely
    ladies lend their voice to a song about some broke-dick stoner dude
    begging for a mercy f***. When the chorus comes around-- ""I would give
    anything to make it with you, just one more time/ I'd give you
    everything I own""-- it's pretty clear that all the narrator has to
    offer is some roach clips and a Foghat LP. It's sad and pathetic all at
    once, and the sparse backdrop of the song-- no drums, please, but a
    little piano would be lovely-- knowingly plays up both those angles.
    It's a nice piece of work (silly asterisks notwithstanding), and its
    inclusion in Pernice Brothers live sets isn't all that surprising.</p><p>
    Thirteen years later, ""Grudge F***"" finds itself all new for 2006, closing out the newest Pernice Brothers record, <em>Live a Little</em>.
    This record is a Scud reunion of sorts, with original SMB producer
    Michael Deming behind the boards. Deming was also the producer of the
    first Pernice Brothers, an album that naysayers and diehard Scud fans
    frowned upon because of its liberal (and supposedly awkward) deployment
    of strings and horns and all that non-Scud stuff. Those guys will be
    happy to put that frown back on their faces-- on this new album, the
    strings come in at all the wrong times. The 2K6 version of ""Grudge
    F***"" is the primary offender. What was once modest and understated is
    now louder than a bullhorn in a library. The track is gussied up with
    strings and drums and harmonies and all sorts of doodads that do a
    great job at destroying what made the track originally work. It's bad
    enough that the track's pseudo-dramatic bridge is undercut by this
    Spectorian bukkake-as-seppuku, but adding backing vocals that belabor
    the obvious-- hey, the narrator really <em>is</em> a loser!-- is just too much.
    </p><p>
    Unfortunately, ""too much"" seems to be a theme with this album as a
    whole. It's not a case of wanton and widespread overindulgence, though
    ""Grudge F***"" might make it seem otherwise. There are just a handful of
    brief but off-putting moments in almost every track that skillfully
    undercut the song as a whole. It doesn't take long for the album to
    step in it, either-- on the album's opening track, ""Automaton"",
    superfluous strings drop in on the chorus, Acme-anvil style. Directly
    following that, Pernice fricassees ""Somerville"" by cramming more
    syllables per line in the song's chorus than the lines will allow,
    scansion be damned. ""Microscopic View"" is a much better showcase for
    both Pernice's motormouth and his penchant for orchestral flourishes,
    but that's scuppered by a bombastic outro that ends falsely four times
    too many. And while the band's website praises Pernice's lyrics as
    being more ""literary"" than on previous albums, listening to the album
    twists that modifier into a pejorative descriptor. 
    </p>
<p>
    Listening to Joe endlessly bombard the listener with rejiggered cliches
    and breathless streams of imagery and other examples of his lyrical
    craft, it sounds less like skillful, effortless writing and more like
    showy, over-considered craftwork. Sure, there are worse aesthetic
    crimes to be accused of than ""trying too hard."" As a longtime fan of
    Pernice's work, though, it's a struggle listening to a musician sound
    like he's forcing something that, once upon a time, sounded so natural.
    I'm not saying Pernice should cut back on the strings and go back to
    that kitchen table. However, instead of paying lip service to his roots
    (as he does here), he might be better served to take a longer look back

Sufjan Stevens, then, is something like the bizarro G.G. Allin, unabashedly reveling in the glory of Christmas with such warmth it pretty much obliterates the word ""irony"" from the English language. And now, the boxset <em>Songs for Christmas</em>, collecting five EPs of seasonal music recorded over the last five years, represents the songwriter's ultimate obscenity to date, even down to titling each disc with scenester swears: Noel, Hark!, Ding! Dong!, Joy, and Peace.<br/></p><p>
    Yet for all the squirming induced by Stevens' brazen faith, the talents that elevate him above your run-of-the-mill coffee-shop folkie are crucially linked to the characteristics that inform his faith: empathy, optimism, and a love of ceremonial pomp.  Not coincidentally, all of these qualities are to be found, as well, in the best Christmas songs, with their exultant melodies and earnest words, and it's no great detective work to hear their influence on Stevens' own songbook, secular and otherwise.  Better still, Yuletide classics have proven through exhaustive interpretation to be highly malleable, suited for portrayals either stirringly intimate (think Vince Guaraldi) or triumphantly gaudy (think Boston Pops)-- two modes of arrangement in which Sufjan has proven himself well versed.</p><p>
    But Sufjan didn't metamorphize from open-mic strummer to chamber-pop bandleader overnight, and that progression is nicely documented by <em>Songs for Christmas</em>.  The first EP, recorded way back in December 2001, shows a simpler, folksier Stevens, assembling a circle of friends to casually dash off seven songs of banjo-plucking and broken harmonies.  Twelve months later, on the second disc, the singer has already begun to spread his clip-on angel wings, most notably on a nearly seven-minute long version of ""What Child is This?"" led by a tweaked Rhodes to an early version of the choral peaks he would perfect with <em>Illinois</em>.
    </p><p>
    In some ways, the mission of recording a Christmas EP every year is almost as conceptually audacious as Stevens' Fifty States Project, given how few seasonal songs are worthy of interpretation.  Thus, <em>Songs for Christmas</em> contains a lot of repetition, another method by which to chart the progress of Sufjan as performer and arranger.  For instance, you won't be surprised to find the melancholy ""O Come O Come Emmanuel"" appearing <em>three times</em> in this box, but each version at least attempts variety: A recorder and banjo Ren-fair take, and two solo piano versions (separated by three years) that are testimony to Stevens' development as a producer.  Similarly, ""Once in Royal David's City"", obscure enough to be a hymnal B-side, is transformed from a fireside jam session on the first disc into a gorgeous reverb-laden music-box variation on the fifth.
    </p>
<p>
    Stevens also fleshes out the set with a hefty helping of exclamation-point-laden original songs, 17 in all; although none of them are likely to make it into the caroling repertoire anytime soon, the set mostly reveals that Stevens' arrangement skills to have evolved more rapidly than his composition talents.  Early efforts are either ragged or strangely depressing in the Guaraldi vein, like the Danielson-sounding ""It's Christmas! Let's Be Glad!"" or the more resurrection-focused tracks (wrong holiday?) of the third EP.  But by the last two discs, the songwriter finds more success in being less reverent, with the Pixies dynamics of ""It's Christmas Time!"" or the goofy Boston-derived organ and handclap charm of ""Get Behind Me, Santa!"" more in the spirit of the holiday.  The fifth disc also excels through appropriate application of the ultra-lush sound of <em>Illinois</em> to December themes, with ""Sister Winter"" and ""Star of Wonder"" ranking alongside his non-holiday catalog's highlights.
    </p>
<p>
    These moments of thick orchestration may be sufficient for the box to sneak into the parents' Christmas music rotation, allowing Stevens to give the greatest gift of all: momentary relief from Mannheim Steamroller.  They also chart a path that's been both rewarding and troubling in Sufjan's career, a progression towards larger and larger arrangements that's beginning to move beyond refreshingly ambitious to redundancy.  But in the service of Christmas, the one time of year where it's okay for even sad hipsters to enjoy excess and earnest feeling, Stevens' ornamentation is excusable, and more consistently successful than the set's earlier, humbler moments, proving that if you're going to commit indie blasphemy, you might as well go all the way.

    As hip-hop and its titanic artists age, there's much hand-wringing over how to do so gracefully. Jay-Z
    has become a stuffed shirt basking in his wealth, resembling a bourgeois
    uncle. Nas curdles as the days pass. Dr. Dre retreats like a sneering Sly
    Stone. Snoop Dogg, unlike his contemporaries, never compels a hand-wring. He is
    as he's always been-- buoyant, lazy, mischievous, misogynistic-- with a voice
    that's nearly tactile and a disposition that begs for anything but keen
    attention. <em>Tha Blue Carpet Treatment</em>,
    his ninth album, has been hailed a stirring return to the form he presented on
    his debut <em>Doggystyle</em>-- a somewhat
    overemphasized idea, but understandable in a year that likely won't be
    remembered as a special one for rap music. What the album actually does is
    present a calming looseness-- nothing shocking or obscure, and better for it.
    Pop it in and clean your bathroom. Or go for a run. Or bring it to a party. Or
    the strip club.</p><p>
    Snoop Dogg is too culturally ubiquitous (lest we mention the
    abhorrent endurance of 'izzle' jokes) to scoff at pop, but there was an interesting
    moment at this year's MTV Video Music Awards. As the Pussycat Dolls accepted
    their award for Dance Video of the Year for ""Buttons"", they thanked Snoop for
    his contribution to the song, an indolent verse. The camera panned to Snoop as
    lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger cooed his name. Snoop responded by paying her no
    mind, scowling in the opposite direction as though someone had openly thanked
    Pol Pot. An amusingly awkward moment, certainly, but also a sort of turning
    point for him. <em>Tha Blue Carpet Treatment</em>
    is not so much a rejection of pop, as a conscious move towards integrating
    gangsta tropes with the accessibility of collaborators like R. Kelly and Akon
    afford.</p><p>
    Snoop rarely says anything of note in his rhymes-- he is the
    truest all form-no content MC of his era. But there are moments here where the
    form is so impeccable that the absence of ideas is almost a positive.  ""Think About It"", a smooth bit of L.A.
    sunshine soul, crackles with meticulous delivery. To wit: ""Incredible,
    forgettable, better blast past the mood of mine/ Many men were eradicated by
    music mine/ Open your eyes and take your time to visualize/ And once you decide
    to move your mind in due time/ It's so erotic you been exotic it's gettin'
    naughty/ Freeze and groove you're rowdy, rowdy girl, move your body/ It's
    melodic I'm being honest and modest/ You done fucked off my whole rap flow,
    think about it."" Those rhymes are vacant, but so captivatingly delivered, we
    can't help but be drawn in.
    </p>
<p>
    The assemblage of collaborators here is obvious at times, inspired in
    others: longtime associate Nate Dogg croons on the indelibly funky
    Fredwreck-produced
    ""Crazy"", Kurupt snarls on two tracks, and the Game delivers one of his
    harshest
    verses of the year on ""Gangbangin' 101"". The vicious
    Timbaland production ""Get a Light"" features a combustible chorus from
    Damian
    Marley while the downy ""That's That"" is one of the smoothest R. Kelly
    team-ups
    in a long time. Because Snoop has so little to offer thematically and
    intellectually, it's a relief he's chosen the perfect collaborators at
    almost
    every turn-- B-Real, Akon, and the Prince Paul-backed Nine Inch Dix all
    body
    their guest spots, too.
    </p>
<p>
    Most bandied about is ""Imagine"", a rare reunion of
    Snoop and his mentor Dr. Dre, not to mention the brief resurrection of
    wounded-wing soul man D'Angelo, who sings (warbles?) the chorus. Dre opens the
    song-- a lounge room piano tumbles down, hard snares clap, orchestral flashes
    ooze elegance-- wondering what might have happened if Biggie and Pac lived, if
    Russell Simmons never became a world-beating entrepreneur, if there were no
    hip-hop. It's a classy affair with an obvious conceit (Imagine if there were dragons
    and elves, too!) but feels earned coming from Dre and Snoop. <em>This</em> is the kind of nostalgia-baiting
    maturity 35-year-old MCs should be making.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, like any Snoop Dogg album since <em>Tha Doggfather</em>, <em>Tha Blue Carpet Treatment</em> is far too long, with an intro and 20
    full-length tracks. Because Snoop is often without substance, our impulse is to
    reward him for doing something... anything. But this is exactly what he has done
    over the last ten years. Some albums are worse than others, but you can count on
    at least six superb pop songs. Here that ratio is higher, even if the aspirations
    aren't.

    between bedroom pop, which singer and primary songwriter James Baluyut
    has proved a few times over he's got a handle on, and more visceral
    full-band arrangements. But more than just that, they slide back and
    forth between the two ambidextrously: The vocals of the opening title
    track crackle with mock-vinyl pops as tooting horns evoke old-timey
    radio, before thunderous distortion erupts over a still-swinging horn
    section.</p><p>
    The band has aways kept more than a few tricks up its sleeve, but it
    has never sounded this versatile. Nor quite this dynamic, as proved by
    ""Fadeout"", hanging on an unaccompanied single-note riff that jitters
    like a plucked rubber band, before bursting forth in the third verse
    like a wiry, hungry reincarnation of Jawbox. It'd be a lame trick if
    the quiet moments weren't so effective on their own. ""Steal the
    Blueprints"" may be guiltier of punching in the stylistic diversions
    without as much substance, but as it yields the album's strongest
    melody, whatever trimmings that are laid on (stabs of programmed bass,
    pedal steel, fleeting palm-muted guitar, and unpredictable drum fills)
    are almost secondary.</p><p>
    Make no mistake, <em>Let's Build a Fire</em>-- originally released in the <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/39798/_ets_Build_a_Fire_Taiwan""><u>Far East</u></a>-- is an heart-on-sleeve,
    borderline-emo pop record. ""The Important Thing Is to Love"" is a dead
    ringer for Elliott Smith (the vocal is uncanny, unabashed
    impersonation), and they're not cringing on their end when dropping a
    line like, ""There's something to be said for waiting/ Despite the
    knowledge it'll never come"" in ""Time and Space"" (or naming a song ""The
    Important Thing Is to Love"", for that matter). However, the diversions
    are no Emperor's new clothes on the same guitar-driven mope. The
    shifting of gears is so smooth that you know it took every hesitant
    earlier step-- digi-pop, off-kilter indie rock-- to get where they are
    now. They're still on the softer, croonier side of indie, certainly,
    but always tuneful and tasteful.
    </p><p>
    ""Thrown Into the Fire"" is the strain of nervous math-pop Chin Up
    Chin Up is still aspiring to, with a tricky CD-skip fake-out that
    introduces trickier, slippery drumming. ""Summer Dress 2"", however, is
    all loopy, chiming arpeggios that sit there to be admired, like the
    medium-good china your mother never busted out. Same with ""Ignoring All
    the Detours"", despite a brief string accompaniment and a fuzz-drenched
    breakdown. It's a shame that, excepting maybe the angst-ridden folk
    digression of ""Profession"", the latter half of the album is less
    dynamic-- certainly pretty, but not much else.
    </p>
<p>
    The thing that all the names dropped above have on +/- is not just
    getting there first, but personality. While +/- are sharp songwriters
    and capable mimics, they've gone through one more transformation as a
    band without arriving at a destination. That said, they remain a step
    ahead just by their modest ambitions, impulsively coloring and pushing
    their songs past the comfort level, always adding some detail to keep
    the listener's interest. That shouldn't be so much to ask, and that's
    what <em>Let's Build a Fire</em> delivers.

    familiar arc. He's a trained clarinetist and saxophonist whose earliest sound
    art, committed to reel-to-reel in the late 1970s and the 1980s, stayed locked
    away for years as he established himself in New York City's art and music
    scene, doing multimedia work and some production, including work with Diamanda Galas. When his early work finally came to light, it brought
    him to broad acclaim, but what we were listening to wasn't actually that work-- it
    was that work warped and chaotically reshaped by time and the failures of human
    recording technology.</p><p>
    In a sense, it was almost like listening to Basinski's own
    memory of his pieces, with occasional gaps, misremembrances, and inadvertent
    reinventions. Hearing the tapes destroy themselves on the spindles was as
    important as hearing the snippets of ghostly piano on them in the first place. What makes
    most of it so listenable is that, unlike a great deal of process music, it's
    deeply emotional-- the little bits of music are simplistically haunting, using
    phrases that remind us of fragments of nursery rhymes or music box melodies.</p><p>
<em>Variations for Piano and Tape</em> is the latest in Basinski's archival series and it's as simple
    as anything that came before it. The single piece, ""Variation #9: Pantelleria"",
    is just a stark five-note piano theme playing over and over for 44 minutes.
    Frankly, I'm a little unclear this time as to what in the transfer process
    caused all the other noises here on the recording. Ostensibly, it's the same
    short loop going round and round, but the tape occasionally slips from the
    head, leaving unpredictable gaps, and there's bleed from the other side of the
    tape. It also clips and echoes and gets periodically garbled by tape machine
    noise that swishes around like oily broth.
    </p><p>
    The permutations have the effect of expanding the theme from
    five notes to nine at several points-- this is apparently caused by the rhythmic
    slipping of the tape so that it plays part of the theme backward. For all its glitches and adherence to Basinski's melancholy, though, this
    is the least interesting of all his archival releases for me-- in no small part
    because the theme he employs is too melodic, and this calls attention to the
    repetition rather than serving it. It's still a beautiful reflection on the
    imperfection of memory, but it doesn't have the soul-rending impact of <em>the Disintegration Loops</em> or even this
    year's <em>Garden</em><em> of Brokenness</em>.

    Congratulations, you wish you were dead. While you're imagining what would
    happen if that bus-- not, alas, a double-decker-- were to ignore the red light
    and spare you another unbearable moment of existence, I'm busy wondering why I
    should care. When the rock scribes of yore slagged Morrissey for his
    unrelenting moroseness, they were missing not only irony, but also the greater
    emotional truths behind even the Smiths' most melodramatic plaints. Acting
    miserable is easy-- psst, <em>eyedrops</em>-- but effectively weaving sadness
    into song, whether earnestly like Elliott Smith or ambiguously like Moz, is
    really, really hard. <span new=""New"" roman=""Roman"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: "" times=""Times""></span></p><p>
    New York indie rockers The Isles may or may not want to go the way of <em>The
    Queen Is Dead</em>'s macabre romantics. Their songs, though, have one foot in
    the grave, one foot in the English gloom of the Smiths and Echo &amp; the
    Bunnymen, and another in the brittle downtown dolefulness of Interpol-- which I
    guess makes them some sort of weird tripod. Gruesome mutations aside, the Isles
    sound more like bored teenagers, or, fatally, like they <em>want</em> to sound
    like bored teenagers: ""I'd be dead, but there's nothing worth dying for/
    In my skin, there are times that I don't belong."" Dude, that's not your
    skin, those are your jeans, and when I get that feeling it means I ate too many
    chalupas.</p><p>
    Are things really so dire? The Isles' alternately jangling and jagged
    mope-rock is polished, if unremarkable; singer Andrew Gellers borrows both
    Moz's strangled enunciations (""<em>loa</em>thing <em>lov</em>ers"") and
    Paul Banks' clipped monotone, though his high, clear whisper is actually more
    like Ben Gibbard's. But Gellers' reactions to daily life suggest not so much
    existential malaise as poorly remembered stereotypes of adolescence, nearly as
    over-the-top as My Chemical Romance but even less believable. ""There are
    some things that I would rather do/ Than spend my time doing what people
    do,"" Gellers offers. 
    </p>
<p>
    Whatever the Isles would rather do, it's probably deathly serious. Polluted
    air? ""I won't breathe anymore,"" Gellers resolves over rubbery bass
    lines on ""Summer Loan"". Out-of-body experience? ""I wasn't flying
    high in the sky/ I went down to hell,"" he moans on finale ""Post Nobles"".
    Then, there's the misguided sex jam, woefully titled ""Eve of the
    Battle"": ""I've got some things on my mind I wanna do to you/ Are you
    coming?"" 
    </p>
<p>
    Without the arch playfulness of Moz or the weary pathos of, say, Johnny
    Cash, the Isles provide little to make their misery compelling to the outside
    world. It probably isn't their fault; as Gellers sagely proffers on opener
    ""Major Arcana"", the most Smiths-like track, ""The breeze cannot
    decide to be fresh/ To be cold."" Cold like the grave, man.

They were supposed to back a singer-songwriter who flaked on them. But instead of packing it in, they wound up     writing their first songs together in order to honor a commitment to a gig     already booked. Two EPs and two albums later, the accidental band is still     making very deliberate music, and though it's not entirely even, <i>Pyramids</i> is their most accomplished     record to date.</p>
<p>They've reconnected with producer John McEntire of Tortoise,     who also helmed the <i>3D Message</i> EP     earlier this year, and you can feel his hand in the album's rough yet     futuristic texture. The buzzy electric piano that dominates the musical     conversation is a particular Chicago post-rock     hallmark and locates the record geographically as easily as a picture of the John Hancock.     While the sound invites, the songs don't, however, and the vocal melodies are     frequently awkward, contorted to fit the weird rhythms or mirror the keyboard     parts.</p>
<p>""Time Monster"" is a perfect example, as the underlying     groove, if it can be called that, sputters along in a triple meter while keyboardist Fay Davis-Jeffers stretches her fragile voice around the words     ""Time doesn't care/ Makes no decisions/ They have already been made."" Syllables     are randomly elongated to fill the melodic space and the result is unmemorable     and uncomfortable. The time monster's cousin ""Brain Monster"" opens the album     feeling similarly uncontoured, but drummer Butchy Fuego (a member of Neutral     Milk Hotel ages ago) and Davis-Jeffers create a damaged texture that redeems     the forced vocal by nearly overwhelming it. The song pulls itself into an     elegant rhythm and ultimately grows downright strident, offering a quick look     at the wonders the trio can work with a simple dynamic concept.</p>
<p>The album finishes with its strongest song, ""Moon Angel"",     where the crisp drums work off of Davis-Jeffers' insistent electric piano     ostinato. Bassist Rob Doran (Alkaline Trio) adds some interesting textural work     in the intro, and the vocal melody, though still a bit of a meander, is at     least loose enough not be distracting. The title track is the most interesting     rhythmic experiment, pairing a fairly basic drum part with electronics and     loops, but McEntire's production fails here, burying the vocals too deeply and     letting sound effects and arrhythmic fuzz bass squelch the song's momentum. As     such, it's bested by the far simpler ""Solstice"", which slides comfortably into     a groove plenty of jazz-funk bands from the 70s would've been plenty happy     with.</p>
<p>The band is so close to having something special that it's     disappointing to come away from the album with so little. Pit er Pat clearly have the     instrumental chops to play whatever they want, but compositionally, they     haven't broken out of a box where every vocal phrase starts on the first beat     and the lyrics scan as though written with little consideration to how they'll     be sung. They've already exhibited growth as a band, but they still have some     growing left before they'll be fully formed.</p></div>"|9622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9622-pyramids/|5.8|Joe Tangari

    what it felt like to hold it in their hands, and how they spent the following
    however many months playing it incessantly. So the set, given its format and
    the slant of its liners, tries to give a taste of what it meant to be following
    the Clash when they were vital and when they made statements a song at a time.
    If you want this set, you either hope to re-live that era of picking up the new
    Clash 45s at they hit the shops-- you were there-- or you want to imagine you
    did.</p><p>
    The music is almost uniformly fantastic. The Clash have
    aged very well, and their appeal now is probably broader than ever. But they
    were always a big-tent kind of band. I was never an anglophile, and I was never
    even remotely a punk, but growing up I could still dig the Clash. They were
    always the most inclusive of punk bands, respected by the hardcore scenesters
    but equally by the dabblers who saw them as one band among many. They achieved
    such democratic appeal in part because of the Beatles-like songwriting tension
    between the late Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, and in part because they never
    stayed any one place for long. Strummer was the heart and soul of the band, but
    Jones tempered Strummer's bellow, softening and broadening the band's sound and
    appeal. Throw in strong musicianship all the way around, lyrics that never took
    the easy path to getting their point across, and an insatiable curiosity and
    you get a band that deserves to be called among the best of the rock era. 
    </p>
<p>
    The growth the Clash show across these 19 singles is
    stunning, from the rough-but-tuneful punk of ""White Riot"",
    ""1977"", and ""Clash City Rockers"" through the unbelievably
    catchy ""White Man (In Hammersmith Palais)"", which set forever the
    template for punk bands dabbling in reggae, and on through dub, downtown disco,
    and hip-hop. If a form of pop music was cool at some point during the late 70s
    and early 80s, the Clash tried it. The super-extended single ""The
    Magnificent Seven"" -- eight tracks long on CD here-- is like a great mini
    album on its own, with various dance mixes of the title track, along with a few
    dubs of the reggae tune ""One More Time"". That such a politically
    oriented band that began with such an abrasive punk rock sound could eventually
    sign-off on the dainty bongo-led funk of these ""Magnificent Seven""
    remixes is inspiring.
    </p>
<p>
    And yet, despite how fantastic the music is and how ace
    the presentation is all the way around, there's something a little odd about
    this set. To package these items in 19 discs, in 19 sleeves, in two layers
    of a box, seems a bit strange when you're talking about a band like the Clash,
    a practical outfit always concerned with economy. They released a double album
    and then a triple in the early 80s, but they made sure their record company
    charged single-album prices for each. This thing is retailing for upwards of
    $75. Not to mention the format of two, three, four songs pre disc. Who wants to
    have to put on three or four CDs to hear a half hour of music? So <em>Singles</em>,
    obviously,<em> </em>is a specialists' item.
    </p>
<p>
    The Clash have been repackaged every which way-- even
    while they were still an active unit-- so the presence of all this music in one
    place isn't in itself a revelation. But <em>The Singles </em>is an enjoyable
    celebration of a by-gone era when one 7"" piece of plastic could sit at the
    center of a world. I'm the oldest Pitchfork writer, and this era even pre-dates
    me. Still, reading the testimonials, seeing the sleeves, and hearing the music,
    it all seems like a crazy amount of fun. But you'll need some scratch to get
    this set and see how it all went down.

    Jay-Z is bigger than this. He doesn't leak singles to the
    street; he launches them on Budweiser commercials during the World Series. He
    doesn't blog on Myspace; he flogs for Hewlett-Packard. He doesn't beg for time
    at MTV; he owns the billboards above it. To most of the world, he's not just a
    rapper, he is <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">the </span><span>rapper. When he calls
    himself the ""Mike Jordan of recordin',"" he's not talking about being the
    greatest player the game has ever known, he's talking about being the game
    itself. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span>But, like athletes, we expect rappers to disappear when they turn 30.
    We have no use for them as they become older and more comfortable with
    themselves-- even if their minds are as sharp as ever. We don't want to see them
    smiling on the cover of <em>Life</em> or hear about their hopes for the future. In
    hip-hop, there is no future. Everything is now because, presumably, it could
    all end </span><span>brutally </span><span>tomorrow. Jay's two biggest rivals are dead,
    and we canonized them partly because they were murdered in their mid-20s, most
    likely because of each other. Jay-Z didn't die young, though. He dubbed himself
    Jay-Hova and lived beyond any of our imaginations, and now he's left to figure
    out what the biggest rapper in the world is supposed to do when he gets old.
    </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The early consensus on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Kingdom Come</span><span> is that it's one of Jay-Z's worst albums. He's still more
    charismatic and intelligent than nearly any other rapper, but for every vintage
    run like the one on ""Trouble"" (""Y'all viewing y'all's version of the Lord God/ MC, little nigga,
    applaud, or/ Forever burn in the fire that I spit at y'all/ I rebuke you little
    nigga/ The meek shall perish/ I'll roof you, little nigga/ I'm a project terrorist""), there are dozens of uninspired stretches and a few horribly
    misguided rants like ""30 Something"", on which Jay unleashes his new
    catchphrase ""30's the new 20,"" and boasts of leaving rap as if he were ashamed
    of his past. His nose in the air, he spits the most ridiculous fiscal rap this
    side of Bloomberg, saying in the chorus, ""now I got black cards, good credit
    and such, baby boy, I'm all grown up.""</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span>He's grown up, alright. With the energy
    Jay brings to most of these tracks, you'd think 30 was the new 60. His patented
    whispery change-up is used more than ever before, and often makes him sound like
    </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Dr. Moreau</span><span>-era Marlon Brando when all we
    needed was a little </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Apocalypse Now</span><span>.
    We didn't expect the young, brash Jigga, but we never thought Jay would be
    flashing AARP brochures in our faces and dropping Gwyneth
    Paltrow's name in a rap song. Twice he addresses his recent heavily publicized
    boycott of Cristal champagne which even he acknowledges is unimportant. But
    that's </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Kingdom Come: </span>Jay boringly rapping about boring stuff and being totally comfortable with it<span><span> </span></span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The production doesn't help, either. Jay-Z's name on an
    album used to be a guarantee of at least a few certified anthems, but <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Kingdom
    Come</span><span> is mostly certified anesthesia. Just
    Blaze's flip of the Allman Brothers' ""Whipping Post"" on ""Oh My God"" is a pretty
    good example of his new stadium rap sound, and his ""Kingdom Come"" take on Rick
    James is pretty clever. </span>But the latter has been sitting<span> on the internet for a long time which means Jay-Z now gets Just sorta Blaze instead full-on
    Blaze. The Neptunes' contribution on ""Anything"" has been accurately compared to the </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Legend of Zelda </span><span>theme, and<span> </span>Swizz Beats' ""Dig a Hole"" might be
    the worst beat to ever appear on a Jay-Z record. It's never a good sign
    when Chris Martin of Coldplay makes the best track on your record, but that
    may be the case with </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Kingdom Come</span><span>.
    It is the first album in Jay-Z's career that doesn't sound like he got first
    choice from his producers, and one has to wonder where the much-talked-about
    Timbaland songs went (</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">FutureSex/LoveSound</span><span>, perhaps?). </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Still, despite the rampant mediocrity, there's an
    interesting theme of spirituality and Jay's own messianic tendencies running
    through this album, hence the title. When Jay-Hova has an identity crisis, the
    proportions are biblical. He believes he's hip-hop's savior, and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Kingdom
    Come</span><span>, at times, sounds like his Passion
    Play. From ""The Prelude""'s genesis story to the title track's sermon on the
    mount to the Kanye West-produced synth-hymn ""Do U Wanna Ride?""-- on which Hov
    introduces his ""beach"" meme-- the narrative arc of the album loosely resembles
    that of the Bible's Gospels, ending with Jay's ascension on ""Beach Chair"". The
    Beach Chair, of course, is not a beach chair; it is a metaphor for the hip-hop
    afterlife where all is happiness and one can wriggle his bare toes in the sand
    if one is not afraid to remove one's sneakers. (Jay was emasculated last summer
    by former Rocafella artist Cam'Ron for wearing sandals on the beach; Jay responds on ""Dig a Hole"" with,
    ""It's like the disciples dissin' Jesus, becoming his rivals."")</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span>It's on the final
    song, the Chris Martin production, that Jay's insecurities about getting old--
    or worse, irrelevant-- are most naked. Over Martin's surprisingly decent-- if
    unsurprisingly epic, rock-ish beat-- Jay muses, ""If the prophecy's correct, then
    the child should have to pay/ For the sins of the father/ So I bartered my
    tomorrow's against my yesterdays…/ I'm both saint and sinner…/ I'm on permanent
    vacay/ Life is but a beach chair/ This song's like a Hallmark card until you
    reach here."" Instead of just making a song about how nice it is to be able to
    sit on the beach, Jay defensively blows a ridiculous image up into a meditation
    on life. It's strange to the point of discomfort at first, but it becomes oddly
    compelling.
    </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But we don't want oddities
    and bizarre narrative arcs from a Jay-Z album. We want unadulterated bangers and innovative
    hustler imagery, and we want the Jay that's invincible and funny and venomous.
    And that's probably the Jay that Jay wants too, but that's not who he is
    anymore. He thinks he's going to save hip-hop and New York City with his
    triumphant return, and maybe he might. But it won't be because he shouldered
    their burdens; it'll be because he shrugged and someone else carried the
    weight. If he wants to remain relevant, it's likely with songs like ""Minority
    Report"", on which he speaks honestly about his response to Hurricane Katrina,
    saying, ""Sure I ponied up a mil/ But I didn't give my time/ So, in reality, I
    didn't give a dime/ Or a damn/ I just put my money in the hands/ Of the same
    people who left my people stranded."" It's the only song on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Kingdom Come </span><span>that offers any real insight into the unique position
    Jay-Z is in, and possibly the only one </span><span>that anyone will care to remember.</span>

    Offering an extended trek into coolly manic garage, the Drones' second
    album, 2005's <em>Wait Long By the River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will
    Float</em> <em>By</em>, announced the band's raison d'etre with its ramblingly
    spot-on title. The Australian quartet traffics in dark subject matter,
    duration, and water. To further establish the correct mood, speak the title slowly and let their sodden,
    anti-anthemic/anthemic rock make you feel like a giddy kid stumbling upon
    something for the first time all over again.</p><p>
    Vocalist/guitarist Gareth Liddiard and guitarist Rui Pereira formed the
    Drones in early 2000. They released an eponymous EP in 2001 and a debut long
    player, <em>Here Come the Lies</em>, a year later. Then came last year's gem. Now
    this, the excellent third full length, <em>Gala Mill</em>. The collection has
    similarities to <em>Wait Long</em>, but does everything better; for instance,
    ""Shark Fin Blues"", my favorite from <em>Wait Long</em>, is buried by
    any number of more powerful clips. They've also outgrown the ""garage,""
    pushing things into the richer, more sophisticated outdoors.</p><p>
    You could assemble a parade with the X,
    the Gun Club, the Birthday Party, the Cramps, or Laughing Hyenas' John Brannon
    with a tad less snarl and a teetering collection of historical texts. That's
    getting somewhere, but mix in Nick Cave's post-Birthday Party patience,
    spaciousness, and literate pronouncements. A couple songs are close to eight
    minutes and one is just about ten; each is packed with Liddiard's wonderfully
    unadorned words. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Gala Mill</em> begins with the faint sound of ""[we're] recording,
    shut up"" and a few seconds of muffled discussion. When
    ""Jezebel"", one of the single most compelling tracks of the year, finally
    kicks in with its rising/falling, herky/jerky motion at the album's 18-second
    mark, the nearly eight-minute roller coaster moves from airborne cancers to
    nuclear rain, cruise missiles, infanticide, vanity, calamity, questions
    (""What's best for the West and the greed?/ Kill 'em all? let 'em
    breed?""), civil war, Daniel Pearl: ""They cut your head off on TV/ But
    I am not a camera/ A man is not an effigy."" 
    </p>
<p>
    A current event roll-call's as novel as Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start
    The Fire"", but Liddiard turns it into a nervous, tough apocalyptic
    epistolary love song. Toward song's end he howls: ""Oh, new scar/ You have
    raised the bar/ Goliath rides an oil drum raft/ Through a cyclone in my ear
    drums/ You don't want a tyrant/ We're sure/ You'd prefer a civil war/ And I am
    gonna lose my skin/ I ain't gonna see you again."" This realization, which
    you know was always bubbling, brings on a toll of crashing drums and feedback. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's by far the best track, but there are a number of seconds. An elegant
    ballad that expands and explodes, ""Dog Eared"" nudges a straight-up
    love song. Issuing a rousing chorus, ""I Don't Ever Want to Change""
    finds a character in ""a house made of stone and a thousand mistakes""
    trying to commune with nature. He burns down the store he runs and lives awhile
    off insurance money. When Liddiard informs us ""I seen the Zoloft put my
    baby in the grave"" he goes into a spate of babbles and yowls. 
    </p>
<p>
    Liddiard reminds me of William T. Vollmann in his quest for historically
    based happenings. ""Words From The Executioner to Alexander Pearce"" is
    based on the 19th century criminal, Alexander Pearce, who escaped prison in
    Tasmania on two occasions; both times he was recaptured, it turned out he'd
    eaten the folks with whom he'd jumped the fence. Six men in all. Liddiard
    inhabits the executioner's mind for a discussion of guilt, empathy, experience,
    forgiveness, and jealousy. One of his metaphor-rich queries: ""Tell me how
    do we taste?"" 
    </p>
<p>
    The band also enters story hour on the closer, ""Sixteen Straws"".
    In the liner notes, we're told, ""To avoid damnation by suicide, groups of
    Catholic convicts would draw straws. The long and the short decided the
    deceased and his killer."" Incorporating a verse from the traditional song
    ""Moreton Bay"", Liddiard carefully paints a scene in colonial
    Australia, backed by just the faint sound of guitars, a harmonica, and his own
    spittle. An escaped prisoner by ""the Brisbane waters"" tells of his
    arrival from Ireland to Australia and his work on the chain gangs. In the
    prisoner's story, he rats out two guys for building a knife and planning to
    murder the head of the place. The perps each get 300 lashes; everyone slowly
    goes crazy for different reasons-- they for their wounds, he for his
    conscience. They decide to draw straws, and then the story actually begins. The
    Drones are fascinating in their approach to painting these tableaus-- the
    confidence in allowing details and power to accrue sans some final crescendo. 
    </p>
<p>
    I've seen the band live, so their interest in this kind of spacious slow
    build makes even more sense: Plenty of room's needed so Liddiard can cock back
    and explode into his meditational, transcendent rants. New Jersey has
    Springsteen, Minneapolis, Craig Finn, and Liddiard's painterly sense of place
    and nation is equally stirring. You get the sense he could kick both the Boss
    and Finn's asses, actually.

    The old maxim about the debut record is that you've had
    your whole life to write it; the flipside is that by the time the public
    finally hears it, you could very well want to be a different band.</p><p>
    That appears to be the case with London five-piece
    Fields, whose inaugural EP deals in the sort of hazy but heartfelt jangly
    guitar pop that, since the mid-1980s, the Brits have been wont to classify as
    ""indie,"" but which, over here in North America circa 2006, has come
    to mean ""Zach Braff panty-remover soundtrack."" Which is to say <em>7
    From the Village</em> boasts all the hallmarks of contemporary, music
    supervisor-friendly collegiate pop: it's urgent but never antagonistic, distorted
    but not abrasively so, lyrically oblique but emotionally obvious.</p><p>
    However, judging by the recent North American tour that brought
    them to CMJ, Fields have now amplified their languid lullabies into
    Muse-sized melodramas, drowning out frontman Nick Peill's acoustic-guitar
    guidance with white-noise squalls, and promoting keyboardist/background
    vocalist Thorun Antonia to spotlight-seizing diva. I'm assuming this sort of
    effects-pedal-to-the-metal attack is what we can expect from Fields' upcoming
    full-length album, produced by alt-rock heavyweight Michael Beinhorn
    (Soundgarden, Soul Asylum), but it'd be a shame if the more winsome Fields
    heard on <em>7 From the Village</em> was completely mowed over in the process. 
    </p>
<p>
    You can already see the writing on the wall with the
    opening ""Song for the Fields"", which begins with two minutes of
    Peill's solo-acoustic tension build-up before the drums trigger a rocked-out,
    strobe-lit-ready finale. But the plaintive pair of ""Isabel"" and
    ""Brittlesticks"" show that the band's real strengths are in the
    subtleties: Peill and Antonia's blurred unisex harmonies; the slide-guitar
    sweeps and glockenspiel chimes that cut through the synth-saturated fuzz; and
    the acoustic strums that give the songs a spirited momentum even when the drum
    tracks get muffled by the dense mix. And though these songs seem destined to
    earn the band a Snow Patrol-sized paycheck, <em>7 From the Village</em>'s best
    track, ""Sisters"", is its most anomalous: an eerie, Wicker Man-worthy
    pagan-folk paean that transforms midway into a raga rave-up, goaded on by
    strange synth squeals and haunting subliminal chants that hearken back to the
    early promise of the Beta Band's <em>Three EPs</em>. While Fields' current live
    set trades in village vernaculars for big-city bombast, let's hope that in
    their quest for hits, the band doesn't lose their connection to the huts.

    The most exhausted adage of the post-rock boom was that bands placed
    within that genre's elastic borders were ""making soundtracks for
    imaginary movies."" It's a popular knee-jerk response to instrumental
    music, the assumption that if the artist doesn't provide a verbal story
    themselves, they must be creating accompaniment to a visual narrative,
    a sentiment reinforced by the ubiquitous film-and-slide visuals of the
    scene's live shows. But cliché or no, it was only a matter of time
    before this questionable logic was repeated often enough to become
    fact, and the big bad industry actively began to pursue post-rock acts
    to score their films. The only surprise of this inevitable partnership
    is the recurrent subject matter of post-rock-scored movies: The
    criminally un-indie wide world of sports.</p><p>
    Consider the trend started by Explosions in the Sky with their ponderous music for the high-school football drama <em>Friday Night Lights</em>,
    which fit the trappings of a film that attempted to make the sport look
    every bit as grandiose as the participants and spectators felt it to
    be. Post-rock's crescendo swells and somber atmospherics were
    surprisingly apt supplements to the slow-motion and deadly serious
    vocabulary of sports propagated by NFL Films' stylized highlights,
    helping transform athletic struggles into the substitute for war and
    violence sociologists keep telling us about. But still, football seemed
    to be an incongruous fit for an indie rock score, given the (admittedly
    stereotyped) assumption that not many Texan high school football
    players probably have Explosions in the Sky on their iPods.</p><p>
    Soccer, on the other hand, has become the indie rock of sports in
    America, with a small, fiercely loyal crowd that aggregates in
    designated locations, a thriving internet community dealing in esoteric
    terminology, and a raging streak of Anglophilia. So, from an outsider's
    perspective, a post-rock album about soccer doesn't seem so weird. Of
    course, Mogwai are Scottish, which means their perspective on soccer is
    more traditional, while tracks like ""Helps Both Ways"" from <em>Come on Die Young</em> and ""Hugh Dallas"" from Matador's <em>Everything Is Nice</em>
    compilation tipped the group's affinity for sport. Thus, on paper, they
    seem like the perfect outfit to score a documentary on the career of
    one of the most acclaimed and controversial of recent soccer
    superstars, Zinedine Zidane. 
    </p>
<p>
    Without having seen the movie-- unsurprisingly, it hasn't yet made it
    Stateside-- I can't fully judge how well the 11 songs included here fit
    the film's subject matter, but certain predictions can be made.
    Certainly the film-- which follows a full match from Zidane's
    perspective, a film experiment that was also conducted in the 1970s
    with George Best as its subject-- is not in the Nike/MTV quick-cut
    style, with the compositions of Mogwai so tortoise-paced that watching
    soccer at regular speed seems to outrun the album when played
    simultaneously. Besides the crawling tempo, the music is also uniformly
    grave and bleak, thick with low-end and storm-cloud piano,
    feedback-drone guitars, and sparse, brushed drumming. YouTube links
    seem to indicate that the film is entirely made up of Zidane close-ups,
    suggesting that the music is meant to underscore the loneliness of the
    midfielder, playing a team sport but isolated on the pitch in front of
    millions of eyes.
    </p>
<p>
    That's all well and good in a theatre, but independent of its visuals, Mogwai's <em>Zidane</em> is a bit of a slog, exhibiting fewer dynamics than the band's usual work.
    Like a nil-nil game, the record contains rewards for those willing and
    able to focus on the subtleties, but feels ultimately unsatisfying,
    producing endless buildup without any payoff-- even songs with
    enthusiastic titles like ""Wake Up and Go Berserk"" or ""I Do Have
    Weapons"" fail to ignite. Part of this circular effect is the repetition
    of melodies; three of the songs appear in two versions, and many of the
    songs ride a similar lead-bass arrangement. 
    </p>
<p>
    But soundtracks are generally less about variety and more about establishing mood, something that <em>Zidane </em>does
    very well. It can also be argued that, in the limited arena of musical
    translations of a singular person or character, that Mogwai's music
    captures the somber, conflicted essence of Zizou, a player whose long
    career of accomplishments was overshadowed by an unfortunate flare of
    temper in his final game, an Algerian who became a national hero for
    his home country's former occupier, a playmaker who maintained a stern
    gravity amidst occasionally weak-kneed and histrionic opponents and
    teammates. The album's success along these lines may lie not in
    post-rock's supposed adeptness in reinforcing the external drama of
    modern sports, but because its instrumental tumult perfectly reflects
    the internal conflict of the athlete himself.

    To hear Karen Dalton sing ""How Sweet It Is"" or ""When a Man
    Loves a Woman"" is to hear the song completely transformed. The Oklahoma-bred,
    New York City-based singer sustains what were previously just grace notes,
    moves the accents around, inverts the rhythms, and plays hide-and-seek with
    meter. Dalton even changes the
    lyrics at the end of ""When a Man Loves a Woman"", fitting them to her female
    perspective. Her talent isn't merely interpretive, but imperialistic: She takes
    these songs over completely, bending their melodies and meanings to fit her
    specific mood. And <em>In My Own Time</em>,
    her second and final album, has a very specific mood: These songs exalt love,
    but acknowledge its transitory nature. Dalton
    gives herself over to its joys on ""How Sweet It Is"", notes its passing on her
    majestic take on Richard Manuel's ""In a Station"", then sounds resigned on
    closer ""Are You Leaving for the Country?"" The album contains just the slightest
    hint of a narrative-- a struggle between love and loss, the city and the country,
    joy and sorrow-- but she sounds honestly conflicted, a jaded romantic trying to
    find her way.</p><p>
    So that phrase ""in my own time"" fairly neatly sums up her
    life. She arrived in New York City
    with her daughter Abra in the early 1960s and became a fixture on the budding East
    Village folk scene-- even sharing
    the stage with Bob Dylan. But Dalton
    moved around compulsively, played rarely and begrudgingly, drank and did drugs
    heavily, and recorded almost never. She enjoyed playing privately with friends
    and hated the Billie Holliday comparison that dogged her throughout her entire
    life. Producer Nick Venet reportedly had to trick her into recording songs for
    her first album, <em>It's So Hard to Tell
    Who's Going to Love You Best,</em> released in 1969 and reissued by Koch in 1997,
    four years after her death. Dalton
    casts a subtle but powerful spell as she sings songs by Tim Hardin, Fred
    Neil, and Duke Ellington with minimal accompaniment. <em>In My Own Time</em> was released in 1971 on producer Harvey Brooks' Just
    Sunshine label and has since been a collector's treasure on vinyl. Admirers
    Nick Cave
    and Devendra Banhart (who is turning folkie resurrection into a cottage
    industry) extol her talents in the liner notes for this affectionate reissue.</p><p>
    Compared to <em>It's So
    Hard to Tell Who's Going to Love You Best</em>,<em> In My Own Time </em>sounds a little more adventurous and lively with
    its full band and free-wheeling performances, seamlessly and playfully blending
    folk, country, rock, jazz, and soul. More than a dozen musicians coalesce into
    a loose, loopy backing band that knows exactly when to push forward (""In a
    Station""), exactly when to back off (""Take Me""), and exactly when to let Dalton
    take front and center (pretty much always). <em>In
    My Own Time</em> has the laidback, lackadaisical vibe of a close-knit group of
    friends doing single takes around an inspired singer. They play up the jazzy
    breeziness of ""Take Me"" and ""Satisfied"" and soak ""In a Station"" with multiple
    organs and Richard Bell's rambling piano, giving the song a majestic push
    ideally showcasing Dalton's
    dramatic range. They tackle the tripping rhythms of ""How Sweet It Is"" as Dalton
    sings almost independent of the familiar melody. 
    </p>
<p>
    With such a clear dynamic between all these musicians, it's
    ironic that two of the album's most moving tracks are also its most naked: the
    bleakly existential ""Katie Cruel"" and the supremely lonely-sounding ""Same Old
    Man"" showcase her elastic vocals and piercing banjo with only minimal
    accompaniment. You could easily spill a thousand words on her pronunciation of
    ""mackintosh."" Like her debut, <em>In My Own
    Time</em> reveals a demanding, intuitive, eccentric singer and arranger who never
    sang her own words but clearly and confidently expressed herself with others'. She
    was a free spirit who sounds freest on these ten tracks. So ""Are You Leaving
    for the Country?"", with its swooning melody and laidback vibe, closes the album
    on a poignant note: this is her final take, her last number ever. It makes you
    wish there was just one more record to reissue and even more music to pore over
    obsessively.

    Evolution-- or at least reproduction, its by-the-episode
    catalyst-- favors survival. As such, nature claims several fairly intricate means
    to that end, systems of existence that make the ""Live, eat, fuck, die"" model a
    bit reductive. The millimeter-long tardigrade, for instance, can end its
    metabolism, enter a state of indefinite cryobiosis, and emerge as healthy as
    ever in favorable conditions years later. Though the California coastline's
    coolest goby fish, the longjaw mudsucker, is a bit less dramatic, it's every
    bit as industrious: A native of tidal zones, the mudsucker is often left
    without water for swimming during low tides. It survives by crawling into a
    self-made burrow, sealing it with mud and entering a state of hypoxia. Quite
    literally, it breathes the air and ingests and excretes the swarm of
    microscopic invertebrates it sucks from surrounding mud.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Imagine it: A fish, buried beneath, waiting for the next
    tide as its signal out. There, baking beneath the sun and without the water to
    swim, it <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">looks</span><span>
    still. But inside the
    burrow, the mudfish is respiring, metabolizing, living. Likewise, each
    of the
    five environments of Mudsuckers-- the collaboration of West Coast
    experimenters
    Robert Horton, Charalambides' Tom Carter, and Yellow Swans' Pete
    Swanson and
    Gabriel Mindel Saloman-- look dormant from above. Each track is marked
    by its
    singular environment, though things seem to be shifting, albeit slowly,
    just
    outside of the borrows: ""Electric Sunflower""-- all droning guitar tones
    barely
    moving over the track's several minutes, signaling that something
    cyclical is
    slowing, coming to an end, retiring-- sounds much like the setting sun
    looks. ""Here Comes the Mud Dragons"", though, is a nine-minute,
    cracked-earth
    affair. Guitars, hyper-frequency sine waves and bowed and manipulated
    cymbals
    set up a piercing, escalating hum. By the seven-minute mark, it's a
    paranoid
    roar, as if the tide is late and the mud is drying. The life beneath is
    at
    risk. But the din eventually settles, the burrow holding against the
    elements.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But those are only surface assessments, and it's not that
    simple. Remember the mudfish, the organism looking for air, food, and survival
    in the burrow it built. In and under the mud, life is teeming with
    microbes-- here, mimicked by a load of glitches, microsounds and intentional
    accidents-- permeating the substrate. Beneath an almost-pastoral drone on
    ""Electric Sunflower"", the tiniest bits of junkhouse percussion rattle around
    and are spontaneously swallowed by the welkin hum. Sometimes, however, even
    those dominating guitars shift out of their premier roles, swelling or
    contracting or flinching as the life below demands. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Nowhere is this analogous relationship more obvious than on
    ""Endocrine Disrupters"", not coincidentally <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mudsuckers</span><span>'</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span><span>best
    18 minutes. Here, with a scabrous tone that steadily downshifts its delay, it's
    as if the fish is decelerating, circling for entry and slogging into a
    temporary residence. Screeching guitars thrust into static roar, creating an
    overhauling environment through sheets of feedback. But Horton's drum
    machines explode from beneath, like a school of microbes flooding the burrow by
    instinct. A tenor saxophone played by guest Henry Kurtz sounds as though it is
    physically searching for air, and Horton's corroded cymbal splashes are like
    the body of the fish clashing against the burrow's constraints. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    It becomes impossible, of course, to identify the sounds
    being ingested and excreted, to identify an instrument's entry point
    from the
    resulting glut of sounds effected by the walls and strings of gear--
    Saloman's
    pedals, Carter's loops, Horton's computers and cassette decks and
    loops,
    Swanson's overpowering reel-to-reel apparatus-- in these sessions. It
    sounds like a fucking-mess microcosm existing inside of a fucking mess
    of a
    world, where the tide knows it has to come back (things start to settle
    15
    minutes after entry) only because that's the way it's always been. Even
    if you've never
    left your front porch, you know exactly how surviving in such a world
    feels.

    There are a couple of things that make Danish such a neat language. One
    is its whimsy-- from the looks of it, you just throw together any
    letters you like and then pronounce them however you want. That's how
    it's possible for ""Under Byen"" to be audibly interpreted as ""Oh'nah
    Boon."" Also, Denmark is pretty much the only place in the world where
    lots of people speak Danish. So if you're a good Danish band that
    writes crappy lyrics, while you might be reviled at home, you'll still
    have a shot abroad. Writing crappy lyrics also frees up time for other
    diversions, like raw foodism, or meticulously tending to your music
    until it's as minutely sculpted as topiary. If Under Byen did indeed
    save time by cutting lyrical corners on <em>Samme Stof Som Stof</em>, it sounds as if they took up at least the latter hobby.</p><p>
    From what we understand, the Danes are apeshit for Under Byen, so we
    doubt the lyrics are crappy. Most Americans are just going to have to
    take their word for it anyway. Under Byen has been reaping accolades in
    their stomping grounds since 1998, when they began releasing their
    elaborate post-rock, which sounds like Björk and Mogwai falling down a
    well together. North America, as it is wont to do with
    non-English-singing bands, has been slower on the uptake, tentatively
    joining in the general apeshit-ness when David Fricke, in 2003, called
    Under Byen the best band in the world. Does Fricke not realize that
    telling Americans a band they've never heard of is ""the best in the
    world"" leads inevitably to disappointment and calumny, or were his
    comments part of some larger plot to passively destroy Under Byen?</p><p>
    Under Byen aren't the best band in the world, but they're very good.
    It actually sounds like they're straining toward being the Animal
    Collective of Mogwais, imbuing those dark, grand structures with weird
    shambles and Henriette Sennenvaldt's uncanny chirping. Going lighter on
    the guitar than many of their post-rock peers, Under Byen center their
    songs around wobbly pianos, melting strings, and shaggy percussion.
    They thread thin, sneaky melodies through shape-shifting veils of fog. <em>Samme Stof Som Stof</em>'s
    sound palette is a vivid and varied range of grays and blues; each song
    is like some giant machine on the verge of shuddering apart. This
    artfully stressed quality is especially apparent on opening track
    ""Pilot"", where Sennenvaldt's airy Kim Gordon cool seems to be all that
    holds the faltering riff and junky percussion together.
    </p>
<p>
    Under Byen's great with eerie beauty, as evidenced by the
    slow-burning arc of music-box lullaby ""Tindrer"", the tiny crystal
    machinery thrumming in ""Heftig"", and the plinky post-<em>Rain Dogs</em>
    creeper ""Film Og Omvendt"". These songs are accomplished and important
    to the album's brooding atmosphere, but Under Byen's at their best when
    they manage to be chilling and catchy at once. To this end, we get ""Den
    Her Sang Handler Om At Få Det Bedste Ud Af Det"", a long and hazily
    segmented pirouette through a ghostly clockwork array of stiff
    arpeggios, tensely sawing strings, stately piano, and a gentle yet
    decidedly Ratatat-esque bridge. Similar to Kronos Quartet's <em>Requiem for a Dream </em>theme,
    the song's various parts roll toward a marching band crescendo in a
    series of cunningly understated dynamic shifts. The title track, with
    its enunciated vocals, speckled percussion, and poppy
    synth-and-handclaps nuggets, is the most overtly Björkian thing on the
    album; it also benefits from this mixture of the off-kilter and the
    infectious. Smart, elegant, and destined to be underappreciated because
    of their greater emphasis on overarching texture than site-specific
    crescendo, Under Byen is shaping up to be the Danish answer to Bark
    Psychosis. Just don't ask me how that answer might be pronounced.

    On a recent weekday evening in New York, four half-naked,
    shallow-chested kids climbed up on a Mercury Lounge stage. With their
    tattoos and long, feminine hair, they looked the sort that can depend
    on constant harassment at gas stations and fast-food restaurants across
    the county. In the crowd was a precise mix of metal fans with
    sleeveless shirts and unwashed frizzy hair, trim hipster girls in slim
    jeans and tight jackets, and generic New York show people. I was there
    for enlightenment. Having been sent Danava's self-titled debut record
    months ago, I still didn't know what to make of it: Seeing them live
    was meant to solve my problem. But they were just as inscrutable when
    they walked off as when they had walked on.</p><p>
    In part, this seems to be by design. Improbably named vocalist and
    guitarist Dusty Sparkles says, about his band, ""It's all about us.""
    During their set, he spoke only a handful of words, and his mates
    looked down as they cranked out the long-running guitar progressions
    and proggy bass juggling that make up the bulk of their eight
    minute-plus songs. By the end, my only novel speculation was that the
    quartet maybe was, in fact, from outer space, a presumption based
    solely on its hairlessness (besides the girly locks, of course) and
    seemingly complete indifference to the audience which had showed up to
    see them play.</p><p>
    On Danava's (say, as they do, 'don-uh-vuh') breakthrough appearance on Kemado's <em>Invaders</em>
    record, their self-contained oddness served as a welcome alternative to
    the more straightforward metal that made up the bulk of the comp. This
    reviewer wrote then in praise of their ""techy, almost no-wave take on
    metal, constantly twitching and sniffing and scratching over shifty
    bass and 'Osbournes' Ozzy vocals."" That track, ""By The Mark"", leads off
    the album as well, in extended form. It sounds just as great: Dazed and
    confused, howling slow-riding riffs, Sparkles' mock operetta vocals
    lazily cresting above the fray, each idea stretched to its
    almost-nonsensical end. 
    </p>
<p>
    So what makes <em>you</em> happy?  <em>Danava</em> is the most
    take-it-or-leave-it record I've heard this year: songs proceed on
    formula, warming up with guitar and keyboard feedback (""Eyes in
    Disguise"", ""Quiet Babies Astray in a Manger""), maturing into
    laser-sharp space rock that runs less on riffs than on flat out,
    indulgent but astute soloing, a brief vocal passage, rinse and repeat.
    I'd put it on while washing my car, if I had one. 
    </p>
<p>
    They're the sole working owners of this sound, an almost glam-rock,
    Hawkwind thing. Not having been alive in the 70s, it's what I imagine
    the decade sounded like: Everybody taking their time, working out their
    riffs gradually, cause there's nothing else to do. In 2006, many with
    whom I've spoken don't feel like they have the time they need to figure
    this band out. Fair enough: the last minute of ten or twelve is always,
    on this record, their best. That's counterintuitive, maybe hostile,
    maybe rewarding. Time will tell if you've got it.

    1991, a decade of dogged obscurity into his Pulp adventure, but finally
    getting his urgent ambition back on track. Which means that this new
    solo debut makes it over a quarter-century since the clock started
    ticking on his peculiar pop career. The uncharitable might suggest that
    countdown ended long ago-- when his band conquered Glastonbury in 95,
    when he stormed Michael Jackson's stage at the Brits in 96, when Pulp's
    greatest hits limped onto an ignominious #71 on the UK charts in 2001--
    and by now we are deep into injury time. Of course, those same people might
    have suggested he call it a day in 91.</p><p>
    The comeback begins, inauspiciously, with a sketchy instrumental
    called ""Loss Adjuster""-- the kind of thing that usually suggests a
    desperate pop musician touting around for a little soundtrack work. But
    in its title at least, it gives a hint of the record's concerns.
    Because it's not only his surname he's mislaid somewhere in the past
    five years: <em>Jarvis</em>
    is the record of someone losing hope, the sound of dejection turned up
    to 10. Cocker was always Britpop's poet laureate of anticipation,
    creaming himself at the thought of the next seedy shag, the glittering
    prospect of fame, the moonage daydream of buzzing around on jetpacks, or
    even the thought of a provincial shopping center fountain in the
    unimaginable year 2000. It was always likely to end in disappointment--
    but how else were you to survive the monotonous mundanity without
    supercharging it with the promise of sex, death, and celebrity? Even
    the crashing hangover of <em>This Is Hardcore</em> took a sneaky, surreptitious thrill in just how sublimely low it could go.</p><p>
    What awaits the disappointed romantic, when he concludes that life
    isn't elsewhere, is the evil of banality... and maybe the banality of
    evil. ""From A to I""-- the title can't quite bring itself to spell
    things out-- is one of a series of gentle little ballads that
    matter-of-factly suggest ""it's the end, why don't you admit it? It's
    the same from Auschwitz to Ipswich."" ""I Will Kill Again"" is another
    morsel of comfort-food turned sour, detailing a middle-class evening--
    a nice family home, a bottle of wine, some classical music-- and the
    overwhelming sensation that at the end of the day, you're a murderer at
    heart. It's an odd effect-- like Radiohead played for queasy laughs, or
    as though Chris Martin was suddenly possessed by the spirits of
    Spengler and Adorno-- but you can't say it's entirely successful.
    Because Cocker's great gift as a writer was his ability to dramatize
    situations, craft little plays within fizzing three-minute pop songs.
    ""Cunts Are Still Running the World""-- the album trailer, and a secret
    track 30 minutes after the record's ended-- makes a point with
    admirable bluntness, and has the thrill of plain speaking in an anodyne
    pop culture, but it's a placard for the pissed-off rather than a pop
    song.
    </p><p>
    ""Black Magic"" nails the disillusion. Like the self-referential
    ""Don't Let Him Waste Your Time,"" it's a stodgy enough lump of glumly
    glam riffola, but it's one of the rare occasions Cocker sounds involved
    in a song. ""You only get to see the light one time in your life,"" he
    complains. ""Is there anything more wretched than having just one
    sight?"". It's bitter but brave, a kind of negative tribute to the magic
    of pop from someone who's been cast out of its spell. Elsewhere he
    sounds most alive singing from beyond the grave: ""Fat children took my
    life,"" he seethes on the eponymous rant. ""The parents are to blame""--
    knowing he's sounding like a nannyish MP or <em>Daily Mail</em>
    reader, but running with it anyway-- ""breeding maggots without the
    sense to turn into flies."" At least he can still get intoxicated with
    disgust.
    </p>
<p>
    Cocker is too much of an entertainer not to offer some way out-- even <em>Hardcore</em>
    tacked on some unconvincing uplift. But the final two tracks here
    really are the strongest, saving the record and suggesting some way out
    of the funk. ""Quantum Theory"" is an eerie prayer to possibility of
    parallel dimensions where ""everyone is happy, fish do not have
    bones...and you are not alone."" There is a better world-- well, because
    there <em>must</em> be. 
    </p>
<p>
    And though it doesn't look strong on paper, it's ""Big Julie"" that makes
    the record worthwhile. It's essentially a Belle and Sebastian song--
    albeit a better one than Stuart Murdoch has mustered for a few of
    years: the story of lonely teenage girl, perved over by the local boys,
    their dads, and even the Sunday School teacher, who finds the <em>promise</em>,
    at least, of liberation, peace, and harmony, in a pop song on the
    radio. ""It's like all the greatest people in the world, jumping up and
    feeling fine,"" he sings. ""It's the sound of her trying to find
    something to like."" It's one of the biggest, most sentimental lines in
    pop's book-- ""her life was saved by rock and roll""-- but the bleakness
    of the songs that precede it, and the desparation Cocker brings to it,
    make the cliché seem earned. It's Jarvis's challenge now, if he really
    wants to make a go of going solo, to try and write a few more songs
    that might be worthy of Big Julie.<br/>

    This would have been the perfect opportunity for a concept
    review. The situation almost demands it. Toronto-based Rock Plaza Central's <em>Are We Not Horses?</em> is after all a
    concept album, a song cycle about mechanical horses programmed to think they're
    real horses, the implication being that their artificial minds and souls still
    act like real ones. <em>And</em> they're
    caught in the middle of an epic war between good and evil. <em>And</em> their story is conveyed in Chris Eaton's high-flying wail of a
    voice, an odd instrument that would be completely off-putting if it weren't so
    touching in its derangement. All those elements just beg for a review that's
    equally far-fetched and out-there, something weird and coolly obtuse.</p><p>
    But for an unsigned band that most readers will not have heard
    prior to reading this piece, I fear that approach would be useless, more
    a showcase for the critic's questionable indulgences than an engaged assessment
    of an album that should find a wide audience in the indie realm. Even worse,
    such a concept review might give the wrong impression of not just <em>Are We Not Horses?</em>, but of Rock Plaza
    Central itself, a loose collective of Toronto musicians that sculpts epic
    indie-folk curios from Eaton's odd and oddly affecting lyrics. The horse thing
    is a crucial but not defining part of this beguiling, often beautiful
    album, so concentrating too much on that part of it threatens to paint these
    songs as cartoonish and detached from the world they want to portray--
    especially considering all the annoying indie acts dressed up like stuffed
    animals these days.</p><p>
    In truth, even after abandoning the concept review idea, I
    feel the burden of responsibility to describe for you music that often seems
    just beyond the reach of verbs and adjectives-- Fiona Stewart's swirling violin running
    tangent to the melodies; those demonstrative horns volleying fanfares across
    Eaton's vocals; the unsettling unraveling of ""My Children, Be Joyful"" and
    closer ""We've Got a Lot to Be Glad For""; the way songs bend themselves into a heraldic
    sing-alongs, as if Eaton is leading a congregation in hymns. His vocals and the
    band's liberal application of brass instruments have inspired many comparisons
    to Neutral Milk Hotel, but in truth, <em>Are
    We Not Horses?</em> recalls Okkervil River's
    similarly hoofed <em>Black Sheep Boy</em> in
    the metaphoric potential of its anthropomorphism as well as in its considerable
    musical accomplishment. 
    </p>
<p>
    And yet, <em>Are We Not
    Horses?</em> is an idiosyncratic work, marked by the musicians' individual and
    collective personalities. A different musical idea illuminates each
    song: On the tense ""Fifteen Hands"", the rattling percussion mimics the horses'
    snorts and whinnies, as if tethered around a dimming campfire, tendrils of
    steam forming in the cold air around their hot skin. Coming out of nowhere, children's
    voices chant ""Go, go, go, go, go!"" on ""When We Go, How We Go (Part II)"", their
    voices pushing the tempo and adding a new element to the mix. The smaller
    moments also resonate: The and-beat piano chords on ""When We Go, How We Go (Part I),
    the Tom Waits rattle of ""Anthem for the Already Defeated"", the desperate
    funeral march of ""Our Pasts, Like Lighthouses"" that rises into a genuinely
    moving finale. Even ""08/14/03"",
    less than a minute long and with only a few lyrics, is sweet in its brevity.
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, the horses could be just a distraction; humanity is Rock Plaza Central's chief concern, and accordingly, <em>Are We Not Horses?</em> is full of humor and
    violence, joy and sex, dignity and death. As much as the
    album is a group effort, much of the credit belongs to Eaton, who
    turns his vocal mannerisms into strengths and manages to sound poignantly unguarded. It shouldn't surprise listeners or readers that
    he is also a novelist, with two books out on Insomniac Press. Similarly, <em>Are We Not Horses?</em> has a novel's sweep,
    with an implied narrative arc that begins with ""I Am an Excellent Steel Horse"",
    with its introductory lyrics and heraldic horns, and ends with the valedictory
    ""We've Got a Lot to Be Glad For"", which gradually fades out as if taking that
    long ride into the sunset. Because the music is so surefooted and evocative-- and Eaton's potentially alienating horse motif is handled with empathy and
    imagination<em>-- Are We Not Horses?</em> remains accessible, supremely affecting, and unique.

Keenan Lawler said in a 2001 interview on the website Documentation and Discourse. The idea that music has to be abstract to entertain may seem counterintuitive, but Lawler's multi-hued work makes a convincing case. Bowing, strumming, and plucking his National Steel resonator (a booming 1920s guitar made of heavy nickel-plated brass), Lawler weaves probing instrumentals that can be raw, dissonant, and rambling, but are never boring.</p><p>
    That's because Lawler's semi-structured approach to improvisation frees him up to explore a wide variety of sounds. On <em>Music for the Bluegrass States</em>, recorded live in his hometown of Louisville, Lawler travels through patches of melody, digressions into tangents, and spots of pure abstraction. His fertile playing, amplified by the resonator's ringing tone, evokes the avant-folk of John Fahey, the minimalist drone of Tony Conrad, the backwoods blues of Charley Patton, and the outsider chill of Jandek. But ultimately Lawler is a lone, restless artist charting his own crooked path to the outer reaches of guitar invention.</p><p>
    Each stop along that road is engaging. Opener ""That Train Has Left the Station"" hammers at percussive chords until they bleed stray notes, while ""Wall Climbing Spirit"" knits off-tune plucks into a head-rush of strums. On the more tuneful side of the album's wide street, ""1930""'s creaky picking creates its own 78-rpm hiss, and the rhythmic melody of ""A Universal Rose""' sticks in the brain like a rustling scarecrow in a windy field.</p><p>
    Two tracks fully unite Lawler's twin affinities for tunefulness and abstraction. His bowing on ""One of These Days"" starts like an orchestra warming up, then morphs into hoedown-worthy string-fiddling. Even more all-encompassing is ""The Air on Mars Is Hard to Breathe, We'll Just Have to Stay in Louisville"", a 26-minute piece that consumes long drones, intricate finger-picking, and a fervent passage in which mantra-like strums entrance Lawler into self-hypnosis. But then much of this album is introspective, like a conversation Lawler is having with himself. He has collaborated with many groups, from Pelt to My Morning Jacket to Matmos, but years of playing alone grants his music an inside-the-brain aura. (Even his contribution to Matmos' <em>The Civil War</em> was done alone, as he gave the group a recording of himself playing guitar inside a sewer pipe.)</p><p>
    This lonely air gives <em>Music for the Bluegrass States</em> the feel of a journey, which is enhanced by pyramid-shaped sequencing. The shortest tracks come at the beginning and end, while ""The Air on Mars…"" occupies the middle, like a mount that Lawler scales to meet a sonic Maharishi. That trek may be the album's peak, but the conclusion is where Lawler encounters a real-life hero: free-jazz legend Albert Ayler. Covering Ayler's funereal ""Our Prayer"", Lawler replaces multi-horn blare with single-guitar solitude, turning a soulful ballad into a private elegy. It's a dazzling trick, but then all of <em>Music for the Bluegrass States</em> is enchanting-- proof that in Lawler's hands, a shiny guitar can become a magic wand. <br/></p></div>"|9590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9590-music-for-the-bluegrass-states/|8.0|Marc Masters

    Here on their second full length, San Francisco's Tussle's M.O. hasn't
    changed, despite some personnel shifts. They're still an instrumental outfit--
    two drummers, bass, electronics-- who would love nothing more than to be
    headlining Dancetaria in 1982, except maybe playing a festival in Munich in
    1972. At their best, they create deep-in-the-pocket grooves that penetrate with
    catchy basslines and terrific drumming, all captured with beautiful fidelity.
    But if you listen at the wrong time, they can strike you as a rhythm section in
    search of a song-- half of a newly unearthed Average White
    Band multi-track recording. Their tracks can be a bit like looking at a two-dimensional
    representation of a cube, as these two parallel realities, both equally valid,
    keep flipping back and forth in your perception.</p><p>
    No question, though, that <em>Telescope Mind</em> improves on Tussle's debut, <em>Kling
    Klang</em>. It's both less dubby and more spacious; the air that was clouded
    with reverb on the debut having been honed into a clear, sharp-edged rhythm
    instrument. It's all in the simplicity of a song like
    ""Warning"", which begins with a completely naked six-note bass
    refrain-- you can almost hear the grips of the players' fingerprints sliding
    across the wound string-- that sounds like it's live in your room even over
    computer speakers. That the ""melody"" driving the song is just three
    notes a whole step apart repeating over and over again on a keyboard doesn't diminish its sheer hookiness.</p><p>
    The following ""Second Guessing"" is even better, and provides
    further evidence as to why the <em>sound </em>of this thing-- props to engineer
    Quinn Luke and mastering engineer Kit Clayton-- is so central to its appeal. It
    begins with a quick bass ostinato, a bass drum, and a single crash cymbal that
    hits and remains audible for the length of its fade, a full five seconds of
    sizzle that allows you to picture the room the track was recorded in and
    imagine the movement happening around the instruments. The sound quality is as
    essential to the impact here as it is with any production by the DFA. 
    </p>
    The
    serious syncopation and polyrhythms on ""Elephants"" are another
    highlight, and the closing
    ""Pow!"" brings in Sal Principato and Dennis Young from Liquid Liquid
    to jam for a cross-generational match up of the downtown 1980s O.G.s and their
    talented acolytes. But the title of this track hints at a potential problem,
    bringing to mind the Beastie Boys instrumental of the same name from <em>Check
    Your Head </em>and later collected on <em>The In Sound From Way Out</em>. Like
    those Beastie Boys interludes, Tussle can come across as too steeped in
    history, concerned only to create some new rare grooves, and playing in a style
    that doesn't allow them to add anything new without becoming something else.
    Then again, if this year's ESG album sounded half as good as this, I would
    have been thrilled.</div>"|9606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9606-telescope-mind/|7.1|Mark Richardson

At the core of every +/- track there's a dewy-eyed     adolescent bitching about some girl in his diary; we just didn't notice     it on the group's previous two releases because of all the electro     dressings and stylistic wanderlust. On this early version of <i>Let's Build a Fire </i>(the Absolutely Kosher version is reviewed <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/39764/_ets_Build_a_Fire""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">here</span></a><i>)</i>, +/-     take way more cues from the heart than brain, sacrificing technical     exploration for good ol' fashioned, bare-boned emoting. So yeah,     consider them all but out of the emo closet.</p>
<p>Before sewing the scarlet ""E"" on their chest though, it's worth noting the more linear advances they're made since 2003's <i>You Are Here</i>.     The opening title track takes genre-hopping to the next level, masking     a straightforward dream popper with Irving Berlin orchestration,     everything cracking and hissing as if out of a 1930s vacuum tube radio.     Propelling the band back to the future, ""Back and Forth"" feels     devoid of human contact, let alone sentimentality. James Baluyut's     unintelligible lyrics blast over an oscillating, out of tune guitar,     the two in tandem fending off a maelstrom chorus of (gasp!) cymbal     crashes and power chords.</p>
<p>However, stripped of their bells and whistles, +/- stands stark naked     for long stretches at a time on <i>Fire</i>, relying on rudimentary chord     changes and wistful vocals reminiscent of Death Cab at their most rote.     ""The Important Thing Is Love"", ""Summer Dress 2 (Iodine)"", and ""Ignoring     All Detours"" comprise a maudlin three-headed monster, providing the     album a warm, gooey middle low on nutrients. ""Detours"" particularly     drags as Baluyut constructs a melody so vapid his croon sounds more     like a digitally-enhanced sine wave.</p>
<p>If they haven't already, +/- now stink a tad like Versus backwash.     There are some real bright spots here that would measure well against     the Wrens twitchy brand of pop-punk, ""Fadeout"" and ""Steal the     Blueprints"" in particular, but these guys seem indifferent to     self-editing, thus creating the massive disparity between those     standouts and clunkers like ""Camouflage Fades Into Trust"", a song that     sounds just as schmaltzy and half-baked as its title suggests. At the     end of the day, the dearth of ideas hamstrings <i>Fire</i>, not     the finely-tuned heartstrings. After all, there's nothing wrong with     wearing your heart on your sleeve, but it becomes problematic when that     gushing heart's also used to patch up some otherwise shoddy stitching.</p></div>"|9654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9654-lets-build-a-fire-taiwan/|6.8|Adam Moerder

    Know Us By the Trail of Dead have suffered both indie backlash and mainstream
    indifference.<span> </span>On their follow-up to <em>Source Tags</em>, 2004's rightfully panned <em>Worlds Apart</em>, the unflinching confidence and frenetic energy that made the band's previous
    albums so convincing suddenly disappeared, leaving little more than a batch of subpar
    radio-ready modern rock songs. <em>Worlds Apart</em>'s slick, overcompressed
    sound brought forth all the cries of ""sellout"" that <em>Source Tags</em> had effectively stifled.</p><p>
    As was the case with its predecessor, the aesthetic faux-pas
    on <em>So Divided </em>can be cringe-inducing.
    <span> </span>It's not pretty. But there's a much
    bigger problem at hand: Trail of Dead don't even sound like a rock band any
    more. <em>So Divided </em>is even more elaborately orchestrated and structured
    than <em>Source Tags and Codes</em>, but its complexity
    seems inorganic and clumsy, revealing the weakness of the source material rather than elevating and enhancing it. There's certainly nothing wrong with forgoing traditional rock instrumentation in favor of lavish arrangements and studio trickery, but the bells and whistles here don't even begin to fill the void created by a complete dissipation of the group's energy.  Even when
    the dizzyingly disparate pieces of the album do fall into place, it seems like
    the work of some external hand; the band achieves crystalline structural
    vistas, but it's never quite clear how they got there, or why.</p><p>
    Indeed, the least sophisticated parts of <em>So Divided</em> are often its most memorable. Opener ""Stand in Silence"" could be easily
    written off as mallpunk, but at the very least it sounds forceful and passionate. <span> </span>It would be easy to accuse
    the band of pandering to radio and MTV, but even their
    commercial instincts seen to be faltering here, as punchy two-minute pop songs
    are needlessly stretched into disjointed epics. <span> </span>This kind of misdirection plagues <em>So Divided</em>: ""Naked Sun"" begins as
    an embarrassing ""Bad to the Bone"" pastiche and segues incongruously into yet
    another two-minute orchestral swell, and closer
    ""Sunken Dreams"" can't seem to figure out whether it's vintage Peter Gabriel or
    a late-90s cell phone commercial.
    </p><p>
    There are a few moments when such disunity works to the
    band's advantage. The percussion-heavy
    ""Wasted State of Mind"" buzzes and shakes nervously through a handful of
    memorable hooks.<span> </span>A cover of Guided by
    Voices' ""The Gold Heart Mountaintop Queen Directory"" fulfills the imaginary
    grandeur of Robert Pollard's original, but lands a bit on the syrupy side. The opening bars of ""Life"" effectively
    incorporate the album's sonic fragmentation into the fabric of the song itself,
    but it quickly separates out into a subpar tune and unnecessary
    embellishment.
    </p>
<p>
    This kind of separation prevents <em>So
    Divided </em>from building any momentum over its deceptively brief 46 minutes. While the band once pushed forward with a
    strength that seemed to surprise even them, <em>So
    Divided</em> ultimately feels scattered and flaccid. <span> </span>Throughout
    the last two Trail of Dead albums, singer Conrad Keely has obsessed over themes
    of distance and division. Whether it's a
    matter of unfortunate irony or frustrated artistic self-awareness, these are
    the very issues preventing the band from making good records. For the time being, Trail of Dead can't even seem to capture
    the fervor of their own ambivalence.

    Simple, American, working-man pride. That's the organizing
    theme of <em>Hag: The Best of Merle Haggard</em>,
    which features a generous 26-song tracklist spanning nearly 40 years. Haggard
    is proud to be an American, and to disagree is to provoke him. He's proud to be
    a square who doesn't buy into hippie immorality. On ""I Take a Lot of Pride in
    Who I Am"", which could have served as the title for this compilation, he sings
    in the voice of a down-and-out drifter who stands tall despite his poverty and
    would never consider taking welfare hand-outs. On ""Branded Man"", he's an ex-con
    who has paid his dues to society but can't shake the stigma of prison. This
    pride, so forcefully conveyed in all these songs, must have been attractive to
    Haggard's audiences in the late 1960s and early 70s-- average Americans who scorned
    the counterculture for its destructiveness, but felt abandoned by the larger
    pop culture. He was proud to fill that gap, to maintain strong American morals
    even as the rest of the country went to hell. Maybe pride was easy: ""Okie from Muskogee""
    made him the most popular country singer in the nation in 1969, and ""The
    Fightin' Side of Me"" cemented that status.</p><p>
    Ironically, while that pride helps give the music its rugged
    virility, it may have cost him fans over the years and deflated his legacy. Haggard
    doesn't have the stature he should: He's less conflicted than Johnny Cash, less
    contemplative than Willie Nelson, lacking their broad popularity outside the confines
    of country music. Partly this is because his two most popular songs are ""Okie"" and ""Fightin'
    Side"", whose political and cultural tangles overshadow his actual music. These
    provocative tunes have lost none of their divisiveness, thanks in part to Toby
    Keith's recent exploitive cover of ""Fightin'"", but also because Haggard's negative
    generalizations about hippies (they don't like ""living right and being free"")
    are identical to current generalizations about liberals. But even in his
    underdog status Haggard seems to take a certain pride: His last few albums on
    smaller labels have been wily and inspired, and current Nashville
    acts like Keith and Gretchen Wilson have introduced him to a younger audience.</p><p>
    This misperception about Haggard's politics made Capitol Nashville's
    reissues of Haggard's first eight albums earlier this year seem revelatory, and
    <em>Hag</em> is strategically timed and
    sequenced to take advantage of this renewed interest. The compilation focuses
    primarily on his early career, when he released a string of albums that are as
    solid and exciting as anything country music has ever produced. Most of these
    tracks predate the mid-1970s, when his popularity was at a peak. There are only
    three from the 1980s, none from the 90s, and too few from recent releases like <em>If I Could Only Fly</em> and <em>Chicago Wind</em>, which weren't comebacks so
    much as reminders that he was still around and relevant.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Hag</em> also features
    three duets from other artists' albums, the inclusion of which seems a little
    suspicious, as if the producers are using bigger names to sell Haggard. He only
    sings a few bars of ""Pancho and Lefty"", which is really a showcase for Willie
    Nelson, and ""I'm Leaving Now"", from Johnny Cash's <em>Solitary Man</em>, is a playful tune that probably wouldn't make an <em>American Recordings</em> best-of. But ""She
    Ain't Hooked on Me No More"", from Keith's <em>Honkytonk</em><em> </em><em>University</em>, showcases Haggard in a
    better light, with his acolyte in obvious awe. Thank God they didn't include
    ""Politically Uncorrect"", his awful duet with Wilson.
    </p>
<p>
    As an introduction to Haggard's music-- or even to the Bakersfield
    sound that he helped popularize-- <em>Hag</em>
    may be unparalleled. Born in Bakersfield
    to transplanted Oklahomans, Haggard was at heart a California
    artist, reared on 1940s and 50s country and influenced by Bob Wills, Tex
    Ritter, and Spade Cooley. You can hear their influence-- especially Wills'-- in
    songs like ""Living with the Shades Pulled Down"", on which Haggard calls out his
    band members to solo, adopting a falsetto much like his hero's. It's an
    original tune, but it could very easily be a Wills cover.
    </p>
<p>
    Some of Haggard's songs might paint him as politically
    reactionary, but musically he was anything but. His style was rough-edged and
    electric, at odds with the Opry's conservatism, and despite his love for his
    influences, he sought to build on those traditions, not preserve them. Listen
    to the way his electric guitar licks against the lyrics on ""Mama Tried"" and ""I'm
    Bringing Home Good News"". Or the way he evokes a poignant, class-specific heartache
    on ""Hungry Eyes"" and ""If We Make It through December"". Listen to those
    intricate horn charts on ""I Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink"" and the randy
    ""Old Man from the Mountain"" or the somber piano that breezes through
    ""Silver Wings"". Like those who settled his home state half a century before he
    was born, Haggard was a pioneer, but his accomplishments have been so
    absorbed by the country mainstream and overwhelmed by Haggard's own divisive
    politics that they're taken for granted. <em>Hag</em>
    is another big step toward correcting that sad state of affairs.

While their name sidesteps modern emo's penchant for cognominal unwieldiness, it has an aspect of glorious emotional ruin, and song titles like ""The Night I Couldn't Stop Crying"", ""I Don't Want to Lose You Tonight"", and ""What's a Place Like That Doing in a Girl Like You"" do little to ameliorate that impression. But you aren't likely to find these Berlin-based, Australian expats playing the Bamboozle Festival anytime soon.</p><p>
    Before emo locked up emotion in a tender yet unbreakable full-nelson, there was goth-- both include eyeliner and melodrama, but they handle the latter with very different emphases. Emo approaches emotional trauma without much regard for subtlety, while goth-- at least goth-influenced rock of the Nick Cave/Black Heart Procession variety that Devastations favors-- is more concerned with sadness's introverted, resigned qualities, and undercuts its self-pity with a canny cynicism that makes the music more palatable to adults. As such, while Devastations' sophomore album, <em>Coal</em>, is undeniably melancholy, the slow-burning arrangements keep histrionics at bay. Devastations always privilege the song above catharsis, and singer Conrad Standish peppers his lovelorn lyrics with sinister noir: ""Lord send me an angel; I'll send her to you,"" he threatens in a choking falsetto amid the seething piano and nauseously reverbed guitars of ""What's a Place Like This Doing in a Girl Like You"".</p><p>
    Any discussion of Devastations has to start with Standish's voice and his dark charisma. Nick Cave is so iconic that some singers seem to think that aping his tics is a shortcut to good songwriting. While Standish borrows many of Cave's inflections and images (""My mother was a whore,"" he deadpans on the title track's trembling piano ballad), he understands that Cave's theatrics wouldn't have gotten him anywhere without solid songwriting to back them up, and <em>Coal</em>, like Spielerfrau's likeminded <em>The Sad Part</em> from earlier this year, is packed from end to end with striking, capable arrangements. The guitar-driven ""The Night I Couldn't Stop Crying"" builds and breaks in dark, crashing waves; Standish emphasizes the dynamic shifts by dropping his baritone to a terse croak. He duets winningly with Bic Runga on ""Man of Fortune"", singing with a prayerful uplift that belies the music's funeral strings, and he rides the galloping chords of ""Take You Home"" toward a screaming crescendo. Always dark, never a caricature, <em>Coal</em> is consistently engaging, and marks Devastations as the emo-band-for-adults that people have tried to make Death Cab for Cutie out to be.</p></div>"|9597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9597-coal/|7.5|Brian Howe

Up till now, Slumber Party's revolving-door roster-- with Berg being the lone constant-- has enlisted pretty much every female in the Detroit area who's ever owned a Spacemen 3 album (a demographic that amounts to about 10 people). But for <em>Musik</em>, Berg revitalizes her band's usual stoned-out strumming with a space-age bachelorette pad makeover that serves to blur the line between the narcotic and robotic.</p><p>
    While the fuzz-disco opener ""10-9-8-7-6-5-4"" suggests a brazen break from form, <em>Musik</em> doesn't attempt to upend the band's Velvet Undergrounded roots as connect them to a more far-reaching psychedelic lineage. The album still features its share of typically slack Nehru-jacket jams (""Destruction/Construction""), rose-tinted lullabies (""Becuz""), and 1970s AM-radio throwbacks (""Madeupmind""), but <em>Musik</em> feels most alive when past and future collide and synthesize, like on ""Thin Is Wide"" (the song that gives this review its opening line), where a hypnotic bed-track of analog electro drones and Eastern-tinged guitar motifs clear the way for Berg's laser-guided melody. It's a DIY sci-fi aesthetic that immediately brings to mind Broadcast's proudly minimal 2005 release, <em>Tender Buttons</em>, with songs built upon skeletal synth patterns that sound like they could be played with two fingers, let alone the nine players listed in <em>Musik</em>'s liners.</p><p>
    But <em>Musik</em>'s spare arrangements are ably filled out by more playful yet assertive vocal performances from Berg; while she's not about to shake off the perennial Nico comparisons, Berg takes advantage of the empty space between the dots and loops by offering uncharacteristically pointed observations about sexual politics. ""So Sick"" comes off like Kraftwerk's ""The Model"" rewritten from the title subject's perspective, with a disarmingly cheerful opening verse-- ""Want to make myself look so sick...if I can do that I can do anything""-- that reveals all the mind games and body politicking that go into maintaining austere appearances. ""Boys/Girls"" is more lightheartedly satirical, skewering the Women are From Venus, Men are From Mars supermarket paperback approach to battle-of-the-sexes delineations (""I'm a shopaholic/ I like to dance/ You're an alcoholic"") over a fun-fun-fun-on-the-autobahn melody that plays up the connection between Berg's android delivery and the lyric's binary logic. But even when she's addressing broader issues of gender, Berg's songwriting tilts more to the personal than polemical, preferring to read between the sheets than make blanket statements.
    </p><p>
    Her focus on the intimate also helps explain why Slumber Party's most vibrant album to date ends with arguably the most downcast song in the band's entire repertoire: ""Electric Cave,"" essentially a piano ballad version of Romeo &amp; Juliet as recited by Eleanor Friedberger, a tragic tale that feels all the more tragic because one of the principals survives. But even in this most sullen of moments, the real benefits of <em>Musik</em>'s more animated electro exercises are still evident, as they've inspired Berg to become the sort of singer that will look you straight in the eye where she once hid behind her bangs.

    President Bush has proven that he doesn't know much
    about science, but he may have been onto something with his infamous
    non-sequitur about the danger of human/animal chimeras in this year's State of
    the Union Address. Cross-species breeding may not be a concern in a genetic
    research sense-- the threat of ligers and geeps (those are goats crossed with sheep,
    look it up) is certainly not impending-- but in musical terms, chimeras are something we should very much be cautious about. Playing Dr. Moreau with the
    DNA of different musical genres has been a pastime of many successful musicians
    throughout the years, but for every triumph of style fusion, there have been
    untold scores of laboratory failures.</p><p>
    These cautionary facts are worth remembering in our
    brave new world, where the blurring of the lines between rock and electronic
    has become common practice. In the current nth revival of dancepunk and new
    wave, it's easy to be tricked into thinking that this process is without
    consequences, with the various sounds fitting together as snugly as jigsaw. But
    merely combining two genres' trademarks doesn't ensure that you'll get the best
    of both worlds; without a fair amount of skill and luck, that fancy new hybrid
    turns out to merely reflect the shortcomings of each world.</p><p>
    The majority of electro-rock act Whitey's <em>The Light
    at the End of the Tunnel is a Train</em> is testament to this warning, as it
    tries to stitch together a thrilling rock-that-dances/dance-that-rocks chimera,
    but often ends up merely reinforcing the most stereotypical complaints about
    each genre. The resulting beast isn't so much an aesthetic affront as it is an
    uninteresting mutt, too often accidentally combining the repetition of the most
    routine electronic music with the predictability of textbook rock. Basing most
    of his songs on live drums and decorating them with riffs and power chords adds
    a crunchy outer layer to Whitey's electronic innards, but these elements end up
    being more of a restriction than an embellishment, bringing only rhythmic
    simplicity and dusty sonics. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's not that <em>The Light at the End of the Tunnel</em>
    doesn't yield several scraps of intriguing ideas as part of its merger, like
    the Marc Bolandroid swagger of ""Non Stop"" or the spy-movie acid-bass
    of ""Tantrum"". But all too often the songs don't constitute anything
    beyond a decent sound looped ad nauseum: ""Can't Go Out, Can't Stay In""
    sounds like one line of ""Little Honda"" skipping in its groove, and
    songs like ""Halfway Done"" and ""In the Limelight"" are
    riddled with mantra-like melodies. With the early exception of ""Leave Them
    All Behind"", which paces itself nicely on the way through a series of
    peaks and valleys, many of the songs are content to run on a treadmill, with
    little of the tension/release that marks the appealing best of both his
    constituent genres. 
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe with Whitey becoming a familiar face on the remix
    circuit, it's not surprising that his own material often sounds more like a
    collection of parts readymade for the remix chop shop rather than finished
    models. The record can't overcome its genetic predisposition as a producer's
    album, more concerned with sound and texture than melodic payoff. Therein lies
    the danger of the chimera: When the creator becomes so enamored with the
    technique, he forgets about the potential shortcomings of the end product.

After a very public falling out with his G-Unit crew, he's waged an endless quixotic war against 50 Cent, hitting the mixtape circuit and unleashing torrent after torrent of deeply entertaining disses. He played an arm-slicing villain named Big Meat in the horrendous ghetto-action Tyrese vehicle <em>Waist Deep</em>. He got a butterfly tattooed on his face and then covered it up. He reportedly got engaged and then un-engaged. He launched a line of sneakers that I see prominently advertised every time I ride the subway, even though I've never actually seen anyone wearing them. He dropped former mentor Dr. Dre's name more times than anyone could count, even though, by all indications, Dre isn't even returning his phone calls. He got bounced around record labels like a virus. And he learned how to rap.</p><p>
    There were a lot of great things about <em>The Documentary</em>, but most of the time Game wasn't one of them. With all the album's glimmering, widescreen big-budget beats and nagging singsong 50 Cent hooks, the rapping grandma from ""America's Got Talent"" could've at least gone gold. A ton of money went into <em>The Documentary</em>, which turned out to be one of last year's best rap albums despite the guy who actually rapped on all the songs. Game had a gruff, clumsy cadence, and he obsessively namedropped every rapper he could think of; it was embarrassing. But on mixtape tracks like the 15-minute freestyle ""300 Bars N Running"", Game discovered how much fun it could be to play around with words. On <em>The Doctor’s Advocate</em>, Game mostly just updates the hamfisted style of the first record, still obsessively dropping names and making ill-advised proclamations about how he's the West Coast Rakim or whatever. But those quirks have hardened into a likeably bizarre personal style, and he's added some of the playfulness of his mixtapes. His constant self-mythologizing feels a little more convincing now that he can bring a certain vividness: ""From the first clap I hurt rap; now watch the earth crack/ Bring the hearse back and take a lyrical dirtnap.""</p><p>
    He's also found a much more interesting context for himself. On <em>The Documentary</em>, he was that new West Coast G-Unit guy. On <em>The Doctor's Advocate</em>, he's the guy who sold millions his first time out but still found himself abandoned by all the people who brought him into the world. And so he's become an army of one, a perennial underdog with a big mouth and a lot to prove. He makes contradictory claims all over the album, dissing 50 Cent and saying that he has no beef with him on the same song. The album, after all, is named after the guy who refused to have anything to do with it. On some songs, Game talks about how down he is with Dre: ""The protégé of the D.R.E./ Take a picture with him and you gotta fuck me."" On others, he casts himself as a victim of forces out of his control: ""I was the Aftermath remedy till friends turned enemies."" And on the title track, he's drunk and on the verge of tears: ""Dre, I ain't mean to turn my back on you/ But I'm a man, and sometimes a man do what he gotta do."" To make things even weirder, fellow Dre beneficiary Busta Rhymes shows up on the track to cosign Game's pleas for attention: ""You gave him something that could make or break a nigga; you should face it/ So big I don't even think he was ready to embrace it."" It's an expensively produced track from two star rappers, but it's apparently intended for an audience of one, and listening to it feels like eavesdropping.
    </p><p>
    To make matters even more complicated, the actual sonics of the album feel like a further entreaty to Dre. There might not be any Dr. Dre tracks on <em>The Doctor's Advocate</em>, but it sounds more like a late-period Dre album than <em>The Documentary</em> did. Game enlists Dre imitators like Scott Storch and Jonathan ""JR"" Rotem to steal Dre's chilly guitar plucks and screaming organs and smeary synths. On ""Compton"", the Black Eyed Peas' Will.I.Am., of all people, pulls off a great little simulacra of Dre's chunky, menacing N.W.A beats. Even the video for ""Let's Ride"" is basically a remake of ""Nothin' But a G Thang"".
    </p>
<p>
    The whole album is like that; Game airs out his dirty laundry and hopelessly tries to work out all his issues with rap and fame and failed relationships, and we try to figure out what the hell is wrong with him. ""Why You Hate the Game"", the epic nine-minute closing track, has a sparkling piano-heavy Just Blaze track and a guest appearance from an on-fire Nas (""Pro-black, I don't pick cotton out of aspirin bottles""), and Game ends it all on a note of unresolved ambivalence: ""I still think about my nigga from time to time/ Make me wanna call 50 and let him know what's on my mind/ But I just held back cuz we ain't beefing like that/ He ain't Big and I ain't Pac and we just eating off rap."" As rap music, <em>The Doctor’s Advocate</em> is good; as tangled psychodrama, it's better.<br/>

    Polly Jean Harvey is such an electrifying live performer that it's not much of a stretch to imagine that-- in a different time and circumstance-- she could have been a bona fide radio star. With her powerhouse vocals, emotionally direct songs and tradition-steeped Old Testament intensity, one can almost picture her clad in black, sharing the airwaves with Hank Williams on the Louisiana Hayride or trading death ballads with the Carter Family on late-Depression border radio. It's a fun scenario to imagine, at least, and perhaps this was what legendary DJ John Peel occasionally had in mind when he enlisted PJ Harvey to perform as a frequent guest on his live BBC Radio One sessions. There's something hypnotic in Harvey's authoritative delivery that loses very little in the broadcasting process, and this ineffable quality is in ready abundance on <em>The Peel Sessions 1991-2004, </em>a choice selection of performances that documents Harvey and Peel's long-standing association, easy rapport, and friendship.</p><p>
    The collection is part of a series intended to commemorate Peel on the second anniversary of his untimely death, and consists of songs hand-chosen by Harvey from her nine official live sessions. It's a testament to the respect Peel showed Harvey-- and all the acts that appeared on his program-- that her appearances were never expected to be just a rote live run-through of her latest hits. Peel instead provided a live forum for artists to perform whatever stray material they so chose, and Harvey's eclectic song selection here is a reflection of this generous freedom. The set includes such rare tracks as ""This Wicked Tongue"" and Harvey's cover of Willie Dixon's ""Wang Dang Doodle"" that have not previously appeared on any of her official albums. And while their inclusion here helps fill in some intriguing blank spots on Harvey's musical map, it also reveals the familiar flicker of Peel's old enthusiasm for piratical adventure.</p><p>
    One of Peel's most distinguishing characteristics, of course, was his indefatigable (and, some might say, indiscriminate) willingness to locate and champion all manner of obscure and/or unsigned artists. In PJ Harvey's case, however, Peel's early support appears to be less a discovery of talent so much as its simple recognition. The first four tracks on this collection are from Harvey's initial session in 1991, recorded nearly a full year before the release of her original trio's debut album. Her relative inexperience notwithstanding, Harvey's skills seem already at peak bloom, and these early songs burst over the wires with an unassailable vitality and swagger. The heavy, forked bass lines of ""Oh My Lover"" and ""Victory"" draw immediate comparison to the Fall-- another of Peel's favorites-- while Harvey showcases her voice's full range and spectrum as she scales gracefully from intimate bedside whispers to the pure elemental wail of ""Water"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Throughout Harvey's classic mid-90s <em>Rid of Me - </em><em>To Bring You My Love </em>period she excelled at writing just the sort of durable avant-blues songs that could withstand virtually any form of severe treatment they were given. Many of these songs have always sounded particularly potent in a stripped-down live setting, so it's rather surprising to note how little attention those albums receive on this collection. Aside from a ferocious rendition of <em>Rid of Me's</em> biblical screed ""Snake"", Harvey has instead chosen to represent the era with more obscure tracks like her lurid ""Naked Cousin"" from the <em>Crow: City of Angels</em> soundtrack or the gorgeous ""That Was My Veil"" from <em>Dance Hall at Louse Point</em>, her underrated collaboration with composer/producer John Parish. 
    </p>
<p>
    Likewise, this collection first enters the new century with the savage electricity of ""This Wicked Tongue"", which previously had appeared only as a Japanese bonus track on 2000's <em>Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea</em>. It's much to Harvey's credit-- and Peel's by extension-- that none of these performances ever feels like a throwaway, and each veritably ripples with spontaneous, one-take-only passion. This is never more true than on the closing version of ""You Come Through"", recorded at a Peel tribute six weeks after his death. In this context the song's lyrics (""You come through for me/ You be well for me"") take on an obvious but undeniable poignancy, sounding at once a heartfelt farewell and a grateful thank-you as Harvey's voice cracks with emotion. As with all newly released Peel Sessions, the appearance of this collection is underscored by the bittersweet realization that this is a document of a fixed history, with no new future installments yet to come. But as such it serves that history in noble fashion, providing fans of both PJ Harvey and John Peel with a vibrant living record whose nervy, protean spirit pushes it miles beyond mere alt-rock radio nostalgia.

    Larry Levan, the legendary DJ who helmed New York's Paradise
    Garage throughout the 1970s and 80s, has such an enviable reputation
    that it frequently outshines the music he loved to play: there's Levan the
    notorious eclectic, spinning every danceable genre under the sun; Levan the
    audiophile, tweaking his speakers for maximum ear-tickling effect; Levan the
    visionary creator of hypnotic extended mixes of pop songs. How can you do
    justice to a man who seemed to exemplify so much?</p><p>
<em>Journey Into Paradise: The Larry Levan Story</em> attempts something a bit humbler than that: Torn
    between documenting Levan's production nous and his good taste, this 2xCD
    compilation haphazardly intermingles tracks produced or remixed by Levan with
    tracks he simply liked to play-- the most common thread throughout is Rhino's
    heavy reliance on its parent-label Warner's back catalog. Whatever its
    provenance, the upshot of this approach is an an unmatchable concentration of
    musical brilliance-- the ""Story,"" if there is one, is ultimately about the
    music rather than the man.</p><p>
<em>Journey Into Paradise</em> is a snapshot of disco as it was transforming into other sounds and styles that would carry the torch for
    hedonistic dancefloor grooves (jazz-funk, r&amp;b, synth-pop), although the
    compilers also pay tribute to disco's mixed-up, stylistically
    ambiguous final chapters with a handful of well-placed inclusions, from the
    glassy synth-pop of Yazoo's ""Situation"" to the iridescent flashes of Talking
    Heads' ""Once in a Lifetime"". Likewise, there are a handful of dreamy, bleary
    moments to satisfy the <em>Disco (Not Disco)</em> enthusiasts, such as the unsteady stoner
    drift of Mann Friday's ""Love Honey, Love Heartache"". It's ultimately to the compilers' credit that they
    resist the temptation to turn this into yet another hyper-eclectic celebration
    of the elasticity of the term ""disco,"" instead concentrating on framing a
    ""Levan sound"" that is crisp, energetic, and relatively classicist-- big-chested
    divas, pounding pianos, chicken-scratch guitar, grand strings, and choirs of
    backing vocalists, all confidently asserting that the road to paradise is paved
    with big-budget professionalism and auditorium-filling dynamics.
    </p>
<p>
    The trick of Levan's style as represented here is to allude
    to both mainstream and underground disco while avoiding being either: Despite
    the music's grandiosity and largesse, it never veers toward excessive
    slickness or formalism. The grooves are raw and spontaneous, but whereas modern
    orthodoxy tells us that this requires stripping back, Levan and like-minded
    producers achieved the same result by piling it on: Check how the heady bustle of Phreek's ""Weekend"" builds without ever climaxing, its enormous multi-tiered
    orchestration a riot of noise, yet in perfect synchronicity. This is bright,
    vivid music, almost painfully sharp in its hyper-alert, meticulous, restless
    density, but it's the overload of detail that leaves you hypnotized-- lost in
    the music, as Sister Sledge put it.
    </p>
<p>
    Torn between extroverted songfulness and space exploration,
    many tracks simply choose both: Levan's 10-minute remix of Inner Life's cover
    of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" moves from a relatively faithful,
    celebratory rendition of the standard into an orgy of shrieking strings,
    clattering percussion and shrill diva exhortations. Conversely, Patrice
    Rushen's ""Haven't You Heard"" is simple but utterly perfect: A sweet love song
    that doubles as an explosion of fierce joy, its ecstatic piano is a deathless
    pop hook that simultaneously foreshadows the ecstasy-triggers of early house
    music.
    </p>
<p>
    It's possible that there is disco that is more camp, more
    epic, more woozy, more soulful, more physical, more strident, or more perverse
    than that which is collected here, but certainly not all at once. In this, <em>Journey
    Into Paradise</em> feels like a conscious
    attempt to portray disco at its most disco, disco in its best possible light; you'll be hard-pressed to find a
    compilation that offers so noble a vision.

    Vivaldi's lilt, Ligeti's playful melodrama, and Portishead's dynamic ambience.</p><p>
    Using over a dozen instruments, Cole records simple, short-phrase melodies
    and nests them, paradoxically crafting moving, triumphant wholes from meddling,
    inconsequential minutiae. On ""This Tar Won't Hold"", for example,
    hammered xylophone, pizzicato cello, violin, bowed xylophone, antiphonal bowed
    cellos, guitar and triangle chase a four-note piano phrase. By track's end,
    most of those samples have been reversed, just a simple piano and shrill violin
    pushing counter to it all; it's a marathon march of perfected baby steps.
    </p><p>
    Cole lets the layers breathe, expand and retract, but he always keeps them
    manageable, wrapped loosely enough to dazzle but tightly enough to survive the
    high-motion long haul he intends. Cole's climaxes are deserved but understated,
    reminders that emotions don't flash between black and white. Opener ""Some
    Shield"" builds for almost five minutes before Cole kills all of the loops,
    allowing only one-- strings in reverse-- to emerge alive. The push to that
    sudden transition is managed through a tension whose release feels earned and
    honest, as though things either <em>had</em>
    to explode or collapse. Even the eight-minute ""3 Forms"", which claims
    the most aggressive crescendo here, does so only after seven vibrant minutes of
    balks and half-starts, a distended rising action of criss-crossing piano lines,
    looming strings and brass crashes eventually culminating into <em>Shadow</em>'s most commanding moment.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, this is the exception: Cole's reliance on spacing and elegance
    elsewhere will leave some stranded, waiting for the staggered stacks of
    sequences and loops to thrust them from a resultant cliff. And, it's true:
    Shirk the details, and it will seem as though, over <em>Shadow</em>'s 49 minutes, Cole builds on
    monotony, a pretty script of nothing from a writer afraid to commit. Variety,
    superficially, is low: Guest Ira Olfstad adds vocals on just two tracks (aside
    from producer Marcus Dyer and a guest cornet, she's the only other
    contributor), and only ""A Remark""-- a brief piano and drum shuffle--
    doesn't develop over think-piece strictures. 
    </p>
<p>
    Even so, if <em>Our Worn Shadow</em>
    suffers from anything it's Cole's over-commitment: He extends his approach of
    high-maintenance restraint everywhere, rarely adding a loop for temporary
    effect. Though one pattern may lose its eminence in the mix, Cole's highly
    considered and specific patterns form an interlocking, all-or-nothing matrix.
    Where one goes, they all usually go, and, over eight tracks, that predictable
    process becomes a bit too lucid.<strong> </strong>Then
    again, Manyfingers is only one man.

<em>...Until the World Is Beautiful</em> ostensibly does everything right. As
    a sophomore album, it's a further assertion of the Portland band's sound and a
    further step away from the shadows of their influences, who comprise a laundry
    list of post-punk heroes from the obvious (the Cure, Joy Division, Wire) to the
    less obvious (the Sound, Section 25, Comsat Angels). As an album, period, it's
    solid, sleek and professional, and it sounds good. So why doesn't it grab me?</p><p>
    If anything, the album is the opposite of a grower. The first time through,
    it sounded pretty cool, but several listens later the songs haven't sunken in,
    and all the tightly managed guitar outbursts are flat and monotonous. The only
    song on the record that breaks the band's mold is the last one,
    ""Untitled"", a slow, dubbed-out instrumental swimming in inky synths
    and minimal, clean-toned guitar figures. On the other end of the album,
    ""The Glow"" is a fine, punchy opener, with a galloping drum part and a
    bassline nicked from Peter Hook's back pocket to support one of vocalist David
    Frederickson's better melodies.</p><p>
    Frederickson's deadpan voice is likeable, even more so when he's paired with
    bassist Mistina Keith, but only a few of these songs give him enough compositionally to be interesting, much less memorable. ""Like Hearts""
    is one of these, containing the record's best vocal hook in his forcefully
    enunciated ""Please don't dramatize,"" followed by a repeated five-note
    guitar phrase that acts as something of a backup hook. It works nicely on its
    own, but the second time through, the guitar hook lurches into a long passage
    of amelodic strumming that puts an unfortunate drag on the song. 
    </p>
<p>
    The band doesn't always take that song's command not to dramatize seriously,
    particularly on ""Infection"", a song almost uniformly covered in
    furiously strummed, heavily distorted guitar that delivers its lyrics little
    more than one word per line and still doesn't sound quite as huge as intended.
    This has something to do with the fact that the song is dynamically similar to
    almost everything else on the record, so the big meltdown before the
    unexpectedly thoughtful closing instrumental is trying to peel paint that's
    already been stripped. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>...Until the World Is Beautiful</em> is a frustrating record, because it
    showcases a competent band with a potentially interesting sound and a paucity
    of songs to match their ambition. Purportedly, the band got its start when
    Keith accosted Frederickson after seeing his then-band play a lackluster show
    and the two agreed to start a band of their own on the spot, in spite of the
    fact that Keith didn't play an instrument. Harnessing that spark of inspiration
    will be crucial for the band going forward as they hone their craft. For the
    moment, it sounds good, but doesn't stick.

Newsom's copious, knotty verse is far removed from that of the old poet, but its effect on the crowd is similar: Yes, it's hard to follow without the lyric sheet,     it takes a few passes to catch the nuances, and all that drama can seem like something of a     history lesson.  <i>Ys</i>-- pronounced     ""ees"" or if you prefer, ""yeesh""-- is free of the jolts and heads-up hooks     we expect from pop music.  But     while it's sure to suffer accusations of empty self-indulgence from some,  many will find the contrary truer: <i>Ys</i> offers an endless wealth of substance, teeming with dense, well-mapped beauty.</p>
<p>Take one example: ""Monkey and Bear"". The song's title characters escape from the farm     where they've lived safely all their lives, before one deviously cons the other into performing for frightened children in order to make a living. Listen to the greed the monkey conveys in degrading, insulting, and controlling the bear, and the tight grip he keeps on her dignity so as not     to lose her-- which, of course, by the end, he does. Not bad for what starts out like a nursery rhyme.</p>
<p>Newsom has said that all five of the songs on this 55-minute album tell true     stories.  But to find them, you'll wade     through lines and lines of fantastic allegories and arcane references.  Early listeners have latched onto the     folky-druid overtones as an excuse to dismiss the record.  But nobody's going to reject a record this bold just because     Newsom uses the word ""thee"" on occasion, or because she appears in promotional photos wearing a     wolf pelt ass-up on her head.  What we     really can't handle is escapism. We instinctively balk at artists who hunker down in their own worlds-- especially     when they force us to guess what they're thinking.</p>
<p>For someone who's been pegged as an ""outsider     artist,"" Newsom chose a presentation that's defiantly decorous.  Van Dyke Parks' orchestration is polite, never intruding on her performance.      And her voice, though less shrieky and childlike than on <i>The Milk-Eyed     Mender</i>,  is still a tough read.  The way she creaks, wavers, and punches the     lyrics is expressive but never in an obvious way; rather than just illuminating     the lyrics, she's almost sticking another code on top of them.</p>
<p>But for all the exquisite melodies, arrangements, and production work, Newsom's lyrics make the performance.  She crafts elaborate images but drives them     with strong actions, and even the densest tangents keep pulling you along.  An image like this one, from ""Emily""--</p>
<p><i> ""I dreamed you were skipping little stones across     the surface of the water<br/> frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever,<br/> in a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror""</i></p>
<p>-- is beautiful in its own right, but it's also full     of movement.  Every line of the record     conveys some want or desire.  This is     easy to hear on ""Only Skin"", the most modern (and Kate Bush-like) cut,     where she describes ""being a woman""-- feeling fear, carrying candy like a     mother, sharing her lover-- with language as vivid as she uses for a cloudy     sky.  Her eloquence starts to feel so     natural that when she sings a line as blunt as, ""Stay with me for a     while/ That's an awfully real gun""-- it sticks out like a rend in fabric.  And the centerpiece, ""Sawdust and Diamonds"",     comes closest to a full release: While the strings take a smoke break, she     performs an exhilarating rhapsody where striking verbs-- ""cleft,"" ""shook,""     ""buckle,"" ""crash""-- support sweeping allusions to death, love, and fear.  Her heart's racing, and she doesn't     stop it.</p>
<p>This isn't a great album because she owns a dog-eared     encyclopedia, or because it stands above the cheap rewards or superficial     freakiness we expected from her.  It's     great because Newsom confronts a mountain of  conflicting feelings, and     sifts through them for every nuance.  It's intricate and crammed with information, but it's never     bookish, and she never sits back in a spell and lets her heart flutter: She     swoops into the sky and races across the ground, names every plant and every     desire, and never feels less than real.      The people who hear this record will split into two crowds: The ones who     think it's silly and precious, and the ones who, once they hear it, won't be able to live without it.</p></div>"|9616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9616-ys/|9.4|Chris Dahlen

Current prisoners include serial killers, child murderers, child rapists, kidnappers, and torturers; it is the only jail in California with an active death row. In 1969, Johnny Cash staged a live concert at San Quentin-- the previous year, Cash's recorded performance at Folsom Prison in Sacramento County had lasted 39 weeks on the Billboard chart, becoming his best-selling LP to date. <i>At San Quentin</i> outsold its predecessor, perching at the top of the chart for four consecutive weeks. The original LP featured 10 songs (edited for sequencing), a 2000 reissue offered 18 tracks, and now Legacy's 3xCD set houses all 31-- 13 of which were previously unavailable-- along with a British television documentary originally aired in 1969. Clearly, singing in prison is a veritable franchise.</p>
<p>Cash's decision to strum up a jail probably had as much to do with his own burgeoning mythology-- the Man in Black, the cold-blooded killer, the anti-Nashville rebel-- than any desire to remedy the U.S. prison system (although Cash did eventually actively advocate prison reform, meeting with President Richard Nixon in July 1972). All the ethical snafus inherent to the deed-- it's easy to argue that Cash exploited the convicts' plight to buoy his own rep, or to sympathize with the families of the prisoners' victims, who might not want to see their loved ones' killer clapping his hands to ""A Boy Named Sue""-- are hard to dismiss, but <i>At San Quentin</i> is still a spectacular musical performance, one of the most mesmerizing live records in American history.</p>
<p>Some of the most notable new additions are the openers, which, for obvious reasons, weren't included on the original Cash LP or its reissue: Carl Perkins performs his own ""Blue Suede Shoes"" to warm up the crowd, complete with a rollicking electric guitar solo. Perkins is followed by Virginia's Statler Brothers (their ""Flowers on the Wall"" was immortalized in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, and gets a rousing reception here). A late-incarnation of the Carter Family (now Helen, June, Anita, and Mother Maybelle) coo, warble, and Carter-scratch through ""The Last Thing on My Mind"" and ""Wildwood Flower"" before Cash finally strides onstage. Most of Cash's performance is familiar by now, but a medley of murder ballad ""The Long Black Veil"" and ""Give My Love to Rose"" is engrossing, and his ""Orange Blossom Special"", weirdly excluded from the other releases, is riddled with questionable double-harmonica and breathless asides.</p>
<p>The 1969 Granada Television documentary, narrated by a (now half-garbled) British voice, eschews typical docu-trappings, avoiding talking crit-heads and shot/voiceover pairings for multi-camera concert footage and an interesting (if brief) meditation on Cash's role as the archetypal western hero: a killer, a savior, and an outlaw. Or, the kind of musician who plays jails, inadvertently glorifying the warm glow of incarceration and making prison look a little bit more fun (plenty in the San Quentin audience are wearing sunglasses, smoking cigars, sneering at the camera, clapping and nodding their heads to Cash's clipped strums). Audience members are interviewed by the crew, probably to humanize their plight, but we get more talk about personal heroes (and not being able to fight for their country and how they miss their wives and how it's actually society's fault that they're all convicts) than any frank admissions of guilt (or details of their respective crimes).</p>
<p>June Carter, whose charm and verve remain intact, tries her best to look complicit, but something in her physical presence-- fidgeting, smiling too much and too big, sneaking sideways glances at Johnny-- seems to indicate general discomfort with the entire endeavor. Cash is accompanied, as usual, by the Tennessee Three, and his performance is jovial-- he jokes with the convicts, snickering ""You're in the wrong place to bend over, don't you know it?""-- and clearly propelled by the audience's adulation.</p>
<p><i>The Legacy Edition</i> is the most comprehensive document of Cash's night at San Quentin, and offers the most authentic portrait of the performance-- from the opening acts through the closing medley, the songs are presented chronologically. As confounding as it is that it took thirty-seven years for an unabridged release, this version of <i>At San Quentin</i> is a satisfying documentation of a still-questionable project.</p></div>"|9618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9618-at-san-quentin-legacy-edition/|7.7|Amanda Petrusich

Wow. In concert, his five-piece backing band swap instruments and hustle after his compositions like stormchasers, putting various tourmates (except for the equally vital Evangelicals) at risk of being outed as indie rock plain bagels. Refreshingly unconcerned with perpetuating cool, Annuals' attack is fundamentally escapist: Baker seems to prefer living inside his ever-aburst music, and listeners will be lured by the world it creates, a place of freakishly sustainable energy fluctuations where surprises would be routine, naps would raise heart rates, and sighs would result from exhilaration rather than exhaustion. Diehard residents of actuality might even find the Annuals' abstract plane inaccessible, or preferable at a distance.</p><p>
<em>
    Be He Me</em> is a crowd, packed with hyperboloid songs that whorl and dimple, digressively executing competent-to-astonishing arrangements in a manner that would seem spazzy if they weren't so polished. ""Antic orchestral pop"" would be the easiest cop-out I could put forth to describe their métier. For further touchstones, think the high-blood-sugar anthems of Rollerskate Skinny or early Mercury Rev, but with classic-rock sheen, earthier lyrical concerns, and worldbeat dalliances. ""Carry Around"" invokes exactly-- <em>exactly</em>-- the futuristic tropicalia that Beck was supposed to be perfecting by now. The disco-waltz ""Complete or Completing"" submerges into a Steely Dan tide, then locks into a chant-groove that is triumphantly resumed on album closer ""Sway"", which dips the last few years of indie-rock's most-soiled dishes into a Ladysmith Black Mambazo rinse.</p><p>
    ""Brother"" is the album's riotous, massive standout, but almost everything's impressive: The purposeful shuffle of ""Mama"", the blurping bits of ""Ida, My"" that are as biomechanical as H.R. Giger's alien design, the general unforcedness, the open-air funhouse moxie, etc. The album's tragic flaw is that, despite the candyland ampedness and the taffylike thickness of the best tracks, <em>Be He Me</em> doesn't offer the listener's active, rational mind much to chew on. One feels too swept into Baker's multicolor dustpan. Even as these songs  synthesize tones I thought I might never hear together-- those of Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer, The Sea &amp; Cake, and Ipecac's roster-- without licking Mars Volta's cheese grater, they ultimately upstage themselves. At the beginning of ""Carry Around"", Baker warns us that he's got ""magic crying out my ass""; let's hope he invests in a filter for gold and not a buttplug.</p></div>"|9607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9607-be-he-me/|7.8|William Bowers

    Utilitarian record sleeves come branded with three bits of
    information for potential consumers: The name of the artist, the title, and the tracklist. The front cover of Johnny and the Moon's eponymous
    album fulfills the first two identifiers, and, expectedly, the flipside lists the
    songs. That's easy enough. There's one fact, though, that the cover <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""></span><span>doesn't mention. Not that it's essential for
    assessment, but as marketing goes, it would probably be wise to slap on a sticker conveying that this is the latest project from Dante DeCaro,
    the Hot Hot Heat guitarist with </span><span>enough </span><span>sense to leave that band and join Wolf
    Parade following the freefall that was </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Elevator</span><span>.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Based on the sleeve alone, a
    would-be buyer could instead make more important extrapolations about this Canadian band: The group's name
    is a truncated take on Johnny and the Moondogs, the moniker the Beatles went by for a time in 1959, when they were still in high school. And that the album is self-titled likely
    signals that it's either a debut or a shift in direction. But, the real
    signifier here is ""Green Rocky Road"", the first of 11 tracks listed. Its
    namesake, ""Green, Green Rocky Road"", is a folk mainstay, written in 1961 by
    Robert Kaufman and Len Chandler and recorded at least a dozen times in the past
    four decades by people ranging from Dave Van Ronk to Emmylou Harris.
    Contemporary recreations of folk standards with nebulous, exposed faultlines?
    Sounds likely.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Indeed, Johnny and the Moon is another band interested in
    attaching traditional folk tones and topics to contemporary rock idioms, but
    it's a long cry from the cyclical revivalism and avant hybridization that
    have both enjoyed surprising success this decade. Instead, it splits the
    difference, a keen realization of rock-borne appeal brightened by folk's
    propensity for parable. Eight tracks are written for drums, voice, and either
    acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, or piano, but almost all of them pepper those
    arrangements ever so slightly with electronics, keyboards, and bells. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""Green Rocky Road"", for instance, gallops to sleigh bells,
    chimes, crotales, and an acoustic guitar, and lines like, ""Hooka, tooka, soda
    cracker/ Does your mamma chew tobacco?"" are handled with a traditionalist's
    reverence. But later, Johnny parades atop an aged saloon piano for ""When You're All
    Alone"" with a driving midsection-- a beer-and-vinegar, bar-room yowl drunk on
    piercing harmonica and a high-flying, atonal horn-- that happily violates the
    stereotypical purity of such recorded balladry. Even the mandolin-helmed ""The
    Ballad of Scarlet Town"" punches up the lonely lusts of young girls and mountain
    men with big-bottom drums and a shout-along, campfire chorus. Its immediacy is
    built on sheer pop exuberance with an ancestral spirit, at least, close at
    hand. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But the album <span>falls
    short in its reach, especially when consciously straddling hemispheres of
    antiquity and reinvention. </span><span>At its worst, the playing seems indecisive, belabored with
    material that seems borrowed and, worse still, impersonal. ""Oleanna""-- a
    rewriting of an obscure tune revived by the Kingston Trio in 1959-- is especially
    timid, as though the long-distance love it employs is the kind of thing that's
    been experienced only in books.</span>
</p>
    Folk music is a deep, daunting well and drawing from it requires
    preparation, if not caution. Given the diversity of North American folk
    relative to the even-keel whole Johnny manages, this is, at times, a
    novice affair, or a broken-bottle weekender between Jesse Malin (DeCaro
    sounds just like him) and Ryan Adams (a Carolinian). Still, these
    non-traditionalist interpretations are imperfectly full of promise and
    earnest enthusiasm, and that's a start.</div>"|9605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9605-johnny-and-the-moon/|7.0|Grayson Currin

<em>Amid the Noise</em> is the third full-length from Brooklyn-based percussion ensemble So Percussion, and it arrives following their rigorous 2004 re-working of Steve Reich's minimalist landmark <em>Drumming</em>. On that recording, So Percussion showcased their startling technique and almost inhuman precision, as they deftly translated Reich's nine-part score as a quartet with the aid of a few crafty overdubs. For their latest work, the group has progressed much further into the world of electronics, so much so that on casual listen one might not even immediately identify the origins of this material. Constructed predominantly with tuned percussives-- bowed marimba, crotales, prepared pipes and vibes-- and meticulously programmed by group member Lawson White, the album is certainly no thundering stampede. Instead it effortlessly recalls-- often to a pristine fault-- the mannered post-rock prevalent in the immediate wake of Tortoise's <em>TNT</em>, skating without a ripple between classical minimalism, hushed gamelan textures, and ambient electronics.</p><p>
    Originally convened in the academic setting of a Yale graduate program, So Percussion are on <em>Amid the Noise </em>trimmed to the trio of White, Adam Sliwinski, and Jason Treuting, with guests Grey McMurray and Masaru Takahashi adding guitar on several tracks. All of the album's 12 pieces were written by Treuting, with an apparent emphasis on exploring the tonal possibilities of the group's idiosyncratic cache of instruments. The parameters of their percussive arsenal were here expanded to include such items as wood planks, an ethernet port, toy piano, and-- naturally-- duct tape. Yet the precise sound sources on softened tracks like the opening ""June"" or the quietly bristling ""White"" have been left rather obscured by Lawson White's various digital embellishments. A jittery, near-dubstep rhythm underscores ""Work Slow Life"", with an anxious, out-of-step melody supplied by grainy interjections from the vibes, giving the track something of the blinkering, off-kilter pulse of a malfunctioning laser printer. Live drums provide ""What the Hell"" with the album's most robust cadence, its limber frame overlaid with gauzy hums of Isotope 217-style guitar and Fender Rhodes.</p><p>
    Included with <em>Amid the Noise</em> is a DVD of accompanying films by Jenise Treuting, each of which consists of a static camera shot of a Manhattan or Tokyo street scene. These short films serve as an effective visual metaphor for each of the album's tracks, as what might initially appear to be an inert or vacant frame can be seen, upon closer examination, to be teeming with continuous quiet activity. This DVD proves to be one of those rare instances where the addition of the visual element can actually help focus the listener's attention on the music's subtle detailing, rather than distract from it-- a fact that unfortunately does So Percussion no favors when the album is heard on its own. As can be typical of such low-pulse ambient instrumental works, <em>Amid the Noise</em> often requires a daunting portion of the listener's attention to avoid wholly seeping off unseen into the floorboards. This is particularly true towards album end, as So Percussion's irregular calendar of tracks (""July"", ""March"", ""February"") blur together in a tangle of high-glossed repetition.

    And while it's a difficult theory to prove, it could certainly be argued that the late ‘90s hyper-abundance of just such over-fussy, refined post-rock helped fuel the subsequent countervailing movement toward more unruly and organic forms of avant-noise, techno, garage rock and free-folk. Lovely though this album can be, too long spent gazing upon its placid surfaces could be enough to convince most listeners that it's not yet time to let that cycle reverse itself too radically. Perhaps here So Percussion have proven able to function at a high level <em>Amid the Noise</em>, but hopefully in the future they'll find a way to allow a healthier level of ambient noise to penetrate and nourish their tranquil conservatory-bred creations.

    he was damn close. From late 1964 through
    1968, Motown had an almost mystical run of incredible commercial and artistic
    success, the likes of which every independent label since could only dream about achieving. Was it
    all gold? No, but that's not the point; besides, a perfect run would be a
    lot less interesting to revisit, as Hip-O Select has spent the last few years
    doing with the entire singles discography of Motown and all of its
    subsidiaries.</p><p>
    Talk about thorough revisits, too-- the five multi-disc
    volumes released so far have collected not only the A and B side from every
    single Motown ever released from its beginnings in 1959 through 1965, but all
    of the scheduled and unreleased A's and B's as well. This is key, because a lot
    of gems surface this way. On <em>Volume 5</em>, you need look no further than Frank Wilson's ""Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)"".
    More than just an interesting rarity, this song is a bloody outrageous
    masterpiece that rightfully became a favorite of Britain's Northern Soul DJs in spite of the fact
    that all but two copies of the original single were destroyed when Wilson decided his career
    should be in producing rather than singing.</p><p>
    This is hardly the first time that song has been
    commercially available, but it's the first time it's been presented with its B-side, ""Sweeter as the Days Go By"", in its greater context as a
    could-have-been smash, alongside other Disc 6 highlights here such as ""My World Is Empty Without You"" by the
    Supremes, Stevie Wonder's awesome ""Uptight
    (Everything's Alright)"", and the Miracles' ""Grooving at the Go-Go"", and those
    are just the biggest anthems.
    </p><p>
    This strong output in such a compacted timeframe was
    hardly an accident. Gordy and his staff had spent Motown's first five years
    calibrating their label into a genuine hit machine with intense PR campaigns
    spearheaded by Al Abrams, who made the Supremes the first African-Americans
    ever to appear on the cover of a weekly TV digest. Quality Control was picking
    from a spoil of riches every Friday morning, and Detroit's
    Hitsville had established colonies in New York
    and L.A., where
    ""Do I Love You"" was produced. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    As its scope expanded in some areas, the label also pulled
    in a few oars and retired them. Country label Mel-O-Dy, the last of the genre-specific
    subsidiaries, was shuttered, and its final three singles are here. It's
    amazing that Mel-O-Dy, which never scored a true hit, managed such a long and
    artistically fruitful run in the Motown stable, but by 1965 there was no reason
    to spread the risk around with the Supremes ruling the charts and Marvin Gaye,
    the Temptations, the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, and the Four Tops all coming on
    strong. Dee Mullins' ""Love Makes the World Go 'Round but Money Greases the
    Wheel"", the first of the three singles here, is about as classic a 1960s country
    tune as you could hope to hear.
    </p>
<p>
    This was a total sideshow, though, and it makes sense that
    Motown would trim the fat and get down to the business of cranking out monster
    hits. A ton of those hits came from the writing/producing team of Lamont Dozier
    and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland. Holland/Dozier/Holland is one of the four
    or five greatest songwriting teams of the 60s, right up there with
    Lennon/McCartney and Goffin/King. By early 65, it seemed like
    anything they gave the Supremes crashed the Top 20, if not the #1 spot, but
    they were having success across the board: The Supremes' ""Back in My Arms
    Again"" was replaced at #1 by the Four Tops' ""I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie
    Honey Bunch)"", which they also wrote and produced. 
    </p>
<p>
    H-D-H had tapped into a wellspring of magic, for sure, but
    there was more to it than that. To get more exciting performances from their
    singers, they intentionally wrote melodies at the extremes of their ranges.
    That was no problem for a guy like Marvin Gaye-- check his almost effortless
    performance on ""You've Been a Long Time Coming"", the B-side of the Smokey
    Robinson-produced ""I'll Be Doggone""-- but you can hear how it took the Four Tops
    version to make it truly sensational. The Tops' Levi Stubbs is the
    picture of anguish on ""It's the Same Old Song"", a song I'll never get enough
    of, no matter how many times I hear it. Little details, like the towing chain
    used as percussion on Martha &amp; the Vandellas' ""Nowhere to Run"", further
    illustrate their genius.
    </p>
<p>
    It's easy to stand back and admire the huge hits (and there
    were a lot of them), but there is a treasure trove of less-appreciated music
    here. Kim Weston's ""I'm Still Loving You"" could give a Northern Soul fan
    palpitations, the Marvelettes' ""I'll Keep Holding On"" drips with relaxed cool, and
    the Spinners' ""I'll Always Love You"" makes you wonder why the Philly soul greats
    didn't get much attention during their time at Motown. In the end, it seems
    like they were just overshadowed-- how do you compete with a group like the
    Miracles, who in '65, in addition to ""Grooving at the Go-Go"", also dropped ""The Tracks
    of My Tears"" <em>and</em> ""Ooh Baby Baby""?
    </p>
<p>
    Motown was huge by the end of 1965, as well it should have
    been, but it was also an interesting year for the label in that it planted
    the seeds for future moves into tougher and more socially conscious arenas over the next few years.
    The assassination of Malcolm X in February fell eerily close to Junior Walker's
    conquest of the charts with ""Shotgun"", probably the single toughest song
    released by the label to that point. X's death shifted Marvin Gaye onto the
    path of exploration that ultimately led him to his masterpiece, <em>What's Going On</em>, in 1971-- Gaye also paid
    tribute that year to Nat King Cole with an album of covers, while the Supremes
    did the same for recently departed Sam Cooke. 
    </p>
<p>
    A song like ""Nowhere to Run"", conceived by H-D-H with
    nothing more in mind than a pop hit, took on a strange resonance during the
    Watts riots-- a prelude to the unrest that would hit Detroit just a few years
    later. For the moment, though, Gordy could be comfortable in his seat atop the
    world and drink in the success that seemed like such a long shot to everyone
    around him only a half-decade earlier.

Or if they want to get technical, they don't like his selections, which generally favor melody or texture or mood over funk. And they don't like his mixing style, which generally favors playing tracks out to their full length and little in the way of hard chops or other mix trickery. They don't like the gothic mood swings of his mixes, his taste for sharp and smelly cheese, or his fondness for trance. And, of course, someone, somewhere was doing something similar, better, earlier-- and never got the fame or the cred that Mayer enjoys.</p><p>
    To which I say: fuck that. Mayer's mixes may offend deep house purists, confuse analog Detroit techno fans, or irritate ""minimal"" heads who enjoy Richie Hawtin's affinity for making super long, super boring tracks out of a million smaller super boring tracks, but he is certainly, unashamedly ""pop""-- at least within the parameters of his genre. He's kind of like the Cure: Sure, he loves to bum you out, but then he'll throw in a ""Love Cats"" now and then. On the other hand, there is no way a sequel to-- not to put too fine a point on it-- one of the best DJ mixes of all time wasn't going to be something of a disappointment. Four years and uncountable dancefloor trends and trendlettes separate this <em>Immer</em> from the first. And anyone looking for a continuation of Mayer's earlier mixes-- with their combination of utter corn (guest spots from Nena! Tweeting birdies!) and brooding dancefloor discontent-- will be slightly confused by the less ostentatious and dramatic <em>Immer 2</em>.</p><p>
<em>Immer 2</em> finally made sense on a drizzly, horrible fucking morning that I spent at my desk with my hungover head in my hands. Since my skull already felt like it was filled with salt water, the crackles and popping bubbles and <em>Sea Quest</em> pings and blips of the opening Someone Else track slowly eased me in, whereas a Jeff Mills blitz might have just sent me running for the Advil. Mayer is nothing if not a master of pacing, and there's no reason why a home-listening DJ mix can't take its sweet time.
    </p><p>
    After the 4/4 push begins in earnest, the next four tracks feel like traditional house sloughing off all that briny water and seaweed, the skipping jazzy hi-hats and bumping basslines of tracks like Ian Simmonds' ""The Dog"" and Frank West's ""2nd Booty"" moving up from the muck and into the light of the mix's brassy disco middle. This is the biggest difference between the two <em>Immer</em> mixes. Whereas the first third of <em>Immer 2</em> creeps and crackles with the same crepuscular 3 a.m. vibe as the first installment, it's difficult to imagine a track that samples (according to the fine folks at ILM) a Boz Scaggs disco tune-- as cheeky and lovable Justus Köhncke's ""Advance"" does here-- fitting alongside the portentous hunk of Mahler's 5th Symphony that Mayer dropped on <em>Immer</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    The Todd Terje remix of Lindstrøm's ""Another Platform"" finds Mayer smack dab in <em>au courant </em>space disco territory. It's as trendy (and speedy) a move as he's ever pulled-- for a moment you might think you were listening to a Get Physical DJ. Needless to say, it's also the mix's most incongruous moment. The final third is more Mayer-esque. It climaxes with the SuperMayer remix of Geiger's ""Good Evening"", an epic trance workout, the kind of anthem you thought was out of fashion in an era of 13 minutes of tics and tocks and clicks and rustles. It's one of the most shiver-inducing singles of the year, featuring the kind of synth blasts in its first few minutes that feel as good a particularly hot and high-pressure shower nozzle. It only goes up from there.
    </p>
<p>
    But the changes this time out have less to do with tempo or Mayer's apparently newfound need to boogie. The first <em>Immer</em>, and especially Mayer's <em>Fabric 13</em> mix, had <em>personality</em>. <em>Immer 2</em> is far less eclectic-- there's nothing here like the stuttering cut ups of Jackson's M83 mix, the portentous reversed strings of Richard Davis' ""Bring Me Closer"", the deranged shuffle of Akufen, or the vampire cotillion vibe of Phantom/Ghost's ""Perfect Lovers"". If fans want to hear this with fresh ears, I'd advise lopping off the <em>Immer</em> from the title, and enjoying one of the better, spacious, and inviting disco-tech mixes of the year without prejudice.

    The best way to follow Amy Annelle and the rotating cast of her band, the
    Places, isn't through the albums that come every two or three years, but
    through the emails in between. She writes to her mailing list every few months
    with messages from road trips and new adopted homes, scrawling a few lines or a
    colorful anecdote like a short but careful postcard from wherever she's hanging
    her hat. And right after self-releasing her excellent, scrapbook-like covers
    album <em>Fawns for Fangs</em>, she returns with <em>Songs for Creeps</em>, another
    disc whose disjointed recording process reflects her travels: One song was recorded
    out in a shack, and all of the rest sound like they were.</p><p>
    Put a seashell to your ear and you'll hear the ocean-- but pick up an empty
    bottle from the parking lot of a gas station, and you'll hear something like
    Annelle's low, murmuring voice. The brash pick-ax guitars of opener
    ""Miners Lie!""-- and that's ""lie"" as in ""dead""--
    are immediately quelled for a series of hushed ballads. The roughest and
    bluesiest, ""The Lion's Share"", sounds like an old 78 that Annelle
    found of herself in a flea market; other slow, sweet melodies drift over
    mellotrons or far-off steel-pedal, though when the going gets rough, Annelle's
    customary murmur sometimes rises to a yowl. But it ends with the sweet and
    lovely ""Worse &amp; Wise"", about the unwelcome return of a long-lost
    lover. Its presentation is as delicate as flowers you buy at that gas station,
    but the intent is so pure it's irresistible.</p><p>
    If the patina of road dust makes the album more romantic than her past
    works, there's another quality to the record that's hard to put your finger on:
    In the strange gaps and distant radio transmissions, you almost feel she's
    listening for something that she can't catch on record. Where the last one, <em>Call
    it Sleep</em>, was dreamy, this is haunted; with so many images of death and
    disappearance in the lyrics, it's not a stretch to wonder if she's leaving room
    on the tape for the dead. And that's not to suggest she rides around with an
    Ouija board in the back of her car, but to say that with so many references to
    distance, detachment, lovers coming and going, or the filters she puts between
    herself and the listener-- like singing into a telephone mic on ""The Damn
    Insane Asylum""-- she's echoing those who made the ultimate departure. And
    aesthetically at least, the effect is compelling; it brings a strange beauty to
    a record that already has plenty of the usual kind.

    Hey, it's another album by Sparta. Hey, it sounds like they're positioning
    themselves as a ballsy version of Snow Patrol. Hey, that lead vocalist is
    really going for that Bono-does-<em>The-Bends</em> vibe. Hey, I wonder who's
    actually going to give a shit. Oh, wait, I know-- suckers searching for some
    aural comfort food, something to occupy their ears that won't make them work too
    hard. Or old farts that hear a bit of Jawbox in some of
    these tracks. Or the kids that are suckers for Mount Rushmore-sized Marshall
    stacks and Red Rocks grandeur in post-punk couture. Or folks that can't find
    the new Coldplay or Muse CDs at Circuit City.</p><p>
    For those of you ready to zing me for my purported lack of a life, please
    note that I am all of the above. Despite my having procured this album through
    nefarious means (hello to our RIAA overlords), I will undoubtedly pony up the
    eight bucks at my local electronics emporium to purchase this CD. I will
    shamelessly air-drum along to ""Erase It Again"" or ""Weather The
    Storm"" in the secluded comfort of my apartment. If I can find my iPod,
    I'll even throw the album on there so I can pantomime like an Ian MacKaye
    wanna-be to most of these tracks while waiting for every light between where I
    was and where I'm going to turn green. My finger might find the fast-forward
    button for slower tracks like ""Unstitch Your Mouth"", because if I wanted
    to listen to <em>OK Computer</em>, I wouldn't be listening to Sparta. But aside
    from those minor speed bumps, I will put this album on when I don't have any
    particular interest in listening to anything in particular. And after two weeks
    or so of playing this record into the ground, I'll delete it from my iPod, and
    replace it with something equally innocuous and inoffensive.</p><p>
    It's that replaceable quality of <em>Threes</em> that gets my goat. It's
    purely coincidental that Sparta themselves are now partially reconstituted,
    with one original member defecting to that other At the Drive In spin-off.
    Sparta's personality is their lack of personality. The group is a
    conglomeration of influences that, while pleasant enough, doesn't rise above
    being anything more than a mixing board of cool-sounding favorites. CD racks in
    the Rock section are full of this type of stuff-- McGriddle-like concoctions
    proffered by professional musicians that take great tastes and slap them
    together for quick and easy consumption. Sometimes, stuff like this sounds like
    the greatest thing in the world. Sometimes (to steal a line from Death Cab for
    Cutie), it's nothing more than the sound of settling.

    suggests the sun's setting on the band's party-hardy days. Even
    frontman Dick Valentine has acknowledged this, noting how the
    ""dance"" trope has been dropped from all lyrics on the new album. That
    said, no one's checking into Betty Ford just yet; in fact, <em>Switzerland</em>'s
    crammed with more sex, drugs, and cocoa puffs (or at least cocoa
    papacies) than ever before. Problem is, who cares what Valentine's
    croaking about if the arena rock's as flaccid as on <em>Señor Smoke</em>?</p><p>
    Fans
    of Fire like to argue that E6's tragic flaw on recent releases has been
    a loss of edge, an abandonment of visceral surf/punk/disco/metal for a tamer, more AOR-centric sound. The easy solution? Turn the amps to 11 and kick more ass. The harsh reality? The more=better strategy
    can flop in practice, no matter how enticing hyperbolizing your art
    appears-- it's why so many ""Family Guy"" jokes tank or why no one listens
    to Michael Moore.</p><p>
    To give credit where it's due, single ""I Buy the Drugs"" and ""Infected Girls"", two of <em>Switzerland</em>'s
    brighter spots, hustle substance abuse and unsafe sex without being
    famished for attention. While the latter twitches over subtle
    electro-rock, ""Drugs"" rallies around a proud titular chorus, the hearty
    power chords almost waxing sentimental. Hell, ""Drugs"" and ""Germans In Mexico"" would
    even pass as Hold Steady B-sides if Valentine could shut his yap.
    Unfortunately, the frontman's crazed growl dashes any nuanced
    developments the band has reached in their songwriting, maintaining a
    grating tone consistently throughout, save maybe for the unexpected
    falsetto on ""Pulling the Plug on the Party"".
    </p><p>
    Scapegoating
    Valentine may seem too easy, but considering this album's concurrent
    release with similar artist Andrew W.K.'s newest and most novel
    offering, the guy's really lagging behind the pomp-rock curve. While
    heeding to a stricter glam doctrine, <em>Switzerland</em> mostly reveals
    the band's arrested development, even to the point of rendering their
    absurdist, irreverent humor irrelevant. After all, trying to delineate
    the band's level of irony would be like taking the stairs in an Escher
    painting--it's an unnecessary mindfuck. The basic dilemma remains that,
    stripped of their shtick and ""Danger! High Voltage"" laurels to be taken
    at face value, the band seems content dicking around with sound effects
    and varied genres rather than eliciting any sort of innate rawk
    reaction, and the sex, drugs, etc. bit stinks of telling, not showing.

    commissioned by Artangel, a British organization that has funded
    crucial art projects by Tony Oursler, Rachel Whiteread, Matthew Barney,
    and Janet Cardiff, among others. But the art world's money lenders
    aren't always on top of things musically. Nab your favorite museum
    director's iPod and count the Fischerspooner tunes. That said, the
    concept's great: Each track focuses on one of the plagues unleashed in the book of Exodus. For those who haven't read it, he dreamt up a pretty
    inventive and persuasive beatdown on the Egyptians-- water turned to blood, gnats and locusts
    swarmed, lice itched, hail fell, your firstborn child (and livestock)
    died, there was darkness and boils and rains of frogs.</p><p>
    Like
    the plagues themselves, these songs didn't appear by their lonesome. Each
    was written and recorded exclusively for the project and performed
    live by artists whom the press release refers to as ""local singers and musicians"" as part of ""The Margate
    Exodus"", an arty reencatment of the Israelites' trek to the Promised Land
    (in Margate, England, of course). Additionally, Penny Woolcock wrote and
    directed a film, <em>Exodus</em>, set for a 2007 release. That fits somehow as
    well-- perhaps this'll be the soundtrack?</p><p>
    As a chipper punk at
    Corpus Christi grammar school I once asked: Why didn't the frogs eat
    all the bugs? Nobody answered it then and nobody answers it here, but
    some of the musicians do take an inventive approach to holy writ. For
    example, Rufus Wainwright croons through ""Katonah"", a song about the
    death of the firstborn. Ingeniously, he
    memorializes his cousin Jack Johnson, who died in a freak accident at age
    19, close to when he was asked to write a piece for the project. As an
    added resonance, Wainwright's sister, Lucy, provides the track with female vocals. Potentially heart-rending, right, but we can all admit
    that Wainwright's songs, though often pretty, sound basically the same. This
    is no exception. He could very well be bummed about some kid with a
    balloon.
    </p><p>
    In the notes for his nearly
    a capella ""Darkness"" Scott Walker says, ""In order to avoid purely
    passive reception, memory kicked in with an elemental lesson from
    childhood schooldays that the filament of the very first light bulb was
    a thread of carbonized cotton."" Suffocating in the nighmarish shadows of <em>The Drift</em>, Walker is backed here by spare percussion and intermittently overdriven by a
    high-pitched choir of banshees until some soulful background singers
    decide they're ""gonna heat it up"" and then ask ""and when do we go?""
    </p>
<p>
    Some
    pieces are more pleasing when the background info is kept in mind, as with Brian Eno and
    Robert Wyatt's ambient, buzzy take on ""Flies"". Wyatt recorded a
    tape of himself making fly sounds; Eno doubled and tripled and
    multi-tracked them amid airy vocals and synth. It's somehow really moving.
    Laurie Anderson's carefully modulated organ-and-string-driven rumination draws inspiration from the autistic author
    and inventor, Temple Grandin, who designs ""humane"" (or at least less horrific) livestock slaughtering facilities, and has published books
    about her ability to mind-meld with cattle. This is coupled with
    Anderson's own attempted mind-meld experience at a bullfight,
    fascinated but saddened by its final trumpet, ""the last sound [the
    bull] hears in this dusty world."" Stephin Merritt provides lice with,
    as he mentions in the notes, a disco beat. It's pleasing (and pretty
    cheeky-- ""fleas, fleas, STD's, all of Egypt on her knees""), but also
    pretty standard Merritt. Great title: ""The Meaning of Lice"".

    Then,
    of course, come the duds. Cody ChestnuTT does ""The Seed"" for ""Boils"".
    Maybe he thought they meant ""blister"" in the Violent Femmes sense? (I'm
    being a jerk, but he actually does mention ""faithful offspring of my
    seed."") Frou Frou singer/songwriter and <em>Garden State</em>/""O.C.""
    soundtrack regular Imogen Heap whips up shiny Warhol for ""Glittering
    Clouds (Locusts)"", envisioning the swarm as a sort of
    rave. Scottish Fence
    Collective folkie King Creosote (aka Kenny Anderson) simply drifts into the ether. Tiger Lilies find slightly more success: Vocalist
    Martyn Jacques has a great, womanly warble, but his London circus
    cabaret trio just sorta bores. And finally, UK rapper Klashnekoff takes the blood
    plague onto city streets in the form of blood stains and inner-city
    violence, using the Lord's Prayer as a chorus. Nice idea, but cliché.

<p>
    While
    listening, I couldn't help thinking of musicians who seemed like
    naturals for the project-- Xiu Xiu, David Tibet, Sunn 0))). That, or
    the fact that <em>The Drift</em> is already basically the perfect plague
    rain.

I know, there goes my alternate-reality comic book idea, too. The Glaswegian cellist/chanteuse introduced herself as the glass hidden in the <em>The Boy With the Arab Strap</em>'s grass with ""Is It Wicked Not to Care?"", her first lead vocal turn: ""It will all be over when you're dead,"" she cooed. Following an early string of understated solo releases, Campbell reestablished herself as the haunted Belle on this year's Mercury Prize-nominate <em>Ballad of the Broken Seas</em>, a rust-and-dust Americana duet with ex-Screaming Trees rumbler Mark Lanegan.</p><p>
    Not even nine months later, <em>Milkwhite Sheets</em> again shows Campbell to be not so much twee as fey-- there's a difference, people. On a collection of original and traditional songs, the winsome singer/songwriter strides through the peat-bogged haints and misty moors of British folk music, armed with an acoustic guitar and her trademark cello. Unfortunately, her girlish voice is drab beside Anne Briggs' mournful peal or the dewy, honey-throated quirks of Shirley Collins-- English folk icons whose doctrinal styles Campbell approximates here, with less breathtaking results. It's not Lanegan that <em>Milkwhite Sheets</em> misses, exactly. But this album could definitely use the sort of counterpoint his creaking overland gruffness gave her previous effort.</p><p>
    It's difficult to slag a folk album for being unoriginal, but the letdown here is that <em>Milkwhite Sheets</em> sounds uninspired at a time when so many musicians are digging treasure from the same ancient, mist-shrouded hills. The freak-folk scene's new weird Americana sometimes may as well be called the new weird Britannica: Druidic airs about meadows, cyclopes, and kings underpin the baroque psychedelia of outsized Philadelphia collective Espers, while San Francisco-based Vetiver filter English folk's ensorcelled strings and droning acoustic guitars through dreamy Marc Bolan workouts, and Brooklyn trio White Magic tangles banshees up in kudzu. Without even getting into Devendra Banhart or Joanna Newsom, there's also Colin Meloy's <em>Sings Shirley Collins </em>EP, Epitaph sea-shanty comp <em>Rogue's Gallery</em>, and the entire pre-2006 catalogue of modern English folkie James Yorkston. In other words, Campbell can't exactly just coast here; other people have heard this stuff, too.
    </p><p>
    Still, it's clear Campbell has discovered a genuine love for the genre, even if she doesn't take it to particularly stirring conclusions. Spare, chime-accented opener ""O Love Is Teasin'"" provides a pretty good indication of where the album is headed, ""then fades away like the mornin' dew,"" as Campbell sings softly. Like the frail, a cappella ""Loving Hannah"", it's a tale of a love done wrong, though on the latter the male/female characters are reversed. Elsewhere, as on ""Yearning"" or the instrumental title track, Campbell layers a cello here, an echoey acoustic guitar there to carve out a sleepy niche in the foggy ancestral forest. Instrumental ""James"" nods toward Nick Drake's ""Cello Song"" in both its lead instrument and its clip-clop conga-drum rhythm, but lacks its forebear's fragile humanity and distinctive, guttural melody.
    </p>
<p>
    Only toward the album's conclusion does Campbell hint at the even more haunted possibilities she may have in mind. Strings grind, bluster, and swoop on the murderous instrumental ""Over the Wheat and the Barley"". Dream-like finale ""Thursday's Child"" uses a light tambourine and deep drum to anchor pinging, opiate reflections, resulting in the album's best-- and least traditional-- tune. ""Take this longing and make it something real,"" Campbell sings, like a pixie Leonard Cohen. Her desire for a self-indulgent ""hobby album"" (her words) whetted, perhaps Campbell will take this track's hazy languor and <em>Ballad of the Broken Sea</em>'s purposeful grandeur and turn in another triumph. Word is her next duet album is with Giant Sand's Howe Gelb. Now there's a fantasy lineup I'd never even contemplated.

    ""Odi et Amo"" from his 2002 album <em>Englabörn</em>. The song opens
    with a string quartet weaving a terribly sad and romantic little platform, and
    standing on top is an operatic tenor run through a vocoder, voicing a poem by
    Catullus, sounding for all the world like a heartsick cyborg mourning the loss
    of power to the circuits of his beloved. Right away, Jóhannsson was presented as a
    composer with interesting ideas about technology and music, ideas
    about the sorts of feelings that might be evoked through juxtaposing electronics
    with history-rich references like a string quartet and an ancient poem.</p><p>
    On his first album for 4AD, Jóhannsson takes the ache of nostalgia for
    obsolete technology and inflates the melodrama to airship proportions. <em>IBM
    1401 - A User's Manual </em>comes with a compelling back-story. Jóhannsson's
    father worked at IBM as a maintenance engineer for the 1401 Data
    Processing System, an early and popular business computer that arrived in
    Iceland in 1964. At that time, keeping a computer up and running involved
    knowledge of machinery as much as electronics; you needed to understand how
    ball bearings worked and know where to pour the motor oil. His father was also
    a musician, and he figured out a way to program the machine's memory so it
    emitted electromagnetic waves in a pattern that could be picked up by a radio
    receiver. The IBM 1401 was taken out of service in 1971, and his father gave it
    a farewell ceremony that included playing some of the short melodies he had
    composed. These tracks were recorded.</p><p>
    You can see where this is going. Jóhannsson found the tapes and began to
    write an elegy of sorts for the 1401, using some of his father's pieces as a
    starting point. It developed into a dance work created in collaboration with
    choreographer Erna Ómarsdóttir and has now been expanded into an album,
    complete with full orchestra. Among Jóhannsson's music that's found its way
    stateside, this is the most dramatic and sweeping by some margin. Gushing,
    cinematic strings rise and fall next to subtle electronic treatments, IBM
    instructional tapes on machine maintenance, and the occasional vocodered voice
    that hearkens back to ""Odi et Amo"".
    </p><p>
    The long fade into the opening ""Part 1 - IBM 1401 Processing
    Unit"", in which a crude electronic sound repeats the theme that will
    appear repeatedly throughout the piece, begins on precisely the right foot. The
    eight-note refrain drips with loss, the kind of sad tune would imagine
    for a mainframe about to be put out to pasture. And when the orchestra emerges
    and plays with the central pulse, which never wavers, Jóhannsson seems to be
    probing, poking at the refrain to see what else sort of feelings might be drawn
    out of it. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Part 2 - IBM 1403 Printer"" combines a dry recording of
    a voice giving instructions on the machine's maintenance over a minimal
    backing of bells and strings that builds in intensity as the piece goes on.
    There's something wonderfully Disneyfied about it, a vision of the future
    frozen in the 1960s accompanied by twinkling, sentimental orchestrations. Here,
    too, the contrast between the voice and the arrangements is enough to maintain
    interest. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Part 3 - IBM 1402 Card Read-Punch"" and "" Part 4 - IBM 729 II
    Magnetic Tape Unit"" however, are the album as its blusteriest, with huge
    swells that feel less earned and fail to resonate. ""Part 5 - The Sun's
    Gone Dim and the Sky's Turned Black"" ends the record on a redemptive note,
    a robotic vocal intoning a hearbreaking little tune over a more muted backing,
    which then climbs to a vast climax that alternates wailing strings with the
    sound of malfunctioning machinery. 
    </p>
    It's
    a powerful finish to a record that begins equally beautifully, but the long sag
    in the middle makes <em>IBM 1401 - A User's Manual </em>a bit harder to recommend
    overall. To ears conditioned by syrupy Hollywood film music, some of these
    orchestrations can sound over-egged, almost to the point of crass manipulation.
    They're <em>pretty</em>, no question about that, but that's not enough for a
    composer like Jóhannsson; the best moments come when the sweetness is heard in
    contrast, usually cut by a pang of longing engendered by the aching nostalgia
    of a future imagined in the recent past. Jóhannsson remains a fascinating
    composer, and the highs here can induce gooseflesh, but the record never quite
    gels into a coherent album-length statement.</div>"|9583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9583-ibm-1401-a-users-manual/|6.9|Mark Richardson

    Sadly, the truth does matter very much in this case,
    because the truth is that Nikki died suddenly after completing this album last
    March, turning the mere act of listening to <em>The Truth Doesn't Matter</em>
    into an autopsy, a chance to pick its lines apart for hints and grave
    prophecies of what was to come. That the actual cause of death remains a
    mystery only encourages this speculative impulse; when Sudden sings ""Oh,
    black tar/ Burns all my money away/ It's not worth the stain on my name to
    relieve the pain,"" chances are he's not taking about road construction. But while <em>The Truth Doesn't Matter</em> features some of the most confessional and openly sentimental songwriting of the former Swell Maps frontman's long, labyrinthine solo career-- making it a natural companion piece to the autobiography he was writing concurrently-- the robust performances and elaborate arrangements here do not sound like the work of someone who was ready to check out.</p><p>
    The stark album packaging emphasizes this point. It has
    no reference to Sudden's passing, no teary-eyed liner-note remembrances-- just
    a series of grainy, black-and-white photos of Sudden in his elder
    bohemian-statesman element (Marc Bolan top hat and all) playing with the boys
    in the band. But if these images reinforce Sudden's lifelong allegiance to a
    shabby-chic form of rock and roll that fell out of public favor sometime after
    1977, <em>The Truth Doesn't Matter</em>'s magnificent opening track, ""Seven
    Miles High"", is surprisingly less CBGB than Studio 54. A winsome tale of
    love-at-first-sight on ""the discotheque floor,"" embellished by a
    pulsing hi-hat groove, a bittersweet synth symphony, and a backing chorus of
    female vocals, it's a consummate portrait of a restless artist who, even in his
    fourth decade of recording, was still looking for new ways to build his
    proverbial car. If no other song on <em>The Truth Doesn't Matter</em> braves as
    radical a departure-- most of the material here is typically beholden to
    Sudden's holy trinity of Dylan, the Stones and the Dolls-- the Spectorized
    swoon of ""The Ballad of Johnny and Marianne"" and somber,
    harmonica-hued piano instrumental ""All This Buttoning and
    Unbuttoning"" achieve the same majestic melancholy.</p><p>
    But even if it comes just five tracks in on a somewhat
    overlong 15-song album, the six-minute ""Green Shield Stamps"" is <em>The
    Truth</em>'s undeniable centerpiece, an autobiographical paean in the vein of
    Neil Young's ""Helpless"" and Van Morrison's ""Cypress Avenue""
    that would surely become Sudden's signature song where he still alive to sing
    it. Over an elegiac, Hammond-soul stroll, Sudden summons a roll call of
    friends, family, and inspirations-- his mom, his deceased brother Epic
    Soundtracks, long-time Jacobites collaborator Dave Kusworth and T. Rex's
    ""Jeepster"", among them-- to ""Raise a glass ... for those teenage
    years you can never get back."" It's a song seemingly designed to invite
    posthumous interpretation, but Sudden doesn't sing it like he's saying goodbye,
    but rather taking stock of his life lessons as a means of carrying on. However,
    if we are to cull an epitaph from this album, let it be the song's final lines:
    ""Dave, Epic and I got together a band or two/ Recorded in our bedroom/
    What else were we gonna do?"" A most fitting testament to the collision of
    boredom and bedlam that initially ignited Sudden's 30-year run, and that will
    continue to inspire future rock and roll renegades long after he's gone.

    adjectives that give critics a bad
    name: angular, sharp, spastic-- basically, shorthand phrases that
    don't actually do much to convey the sound of a record to the reader. Moreover,
    comparisons to Brainiac or Fugazi can only go so far. And with Ad
    Astra Per Aspera-- as well as plenty of others-- even though they pull
    from those influences, they never exactly sound like the bands.
    Sometimes what separates one band's sound from another is just out of
    reach, something you can't quite place. So while there are moments on
    <em>Catapult Calypso</em> that sound reminiscent, chalk it up to
    similarities in approach rather than a lack of originality. Because
    if there's one thing this band's got plenty of, it's originality.</p><p>
    How many rock records have you heard recently that infuse screamy
    post-hardcore with melodies that sound like castoffs from <em>Fiddler
    on the Roof</em>? Probably not many, and for good reason. But Ad Astra
    Per Aspera pull it off here and there. There's a little bit of
    everything in this mish-mash, and sometimes it works better than
    others. The disc's first track, ""Voodoo Economics"", bounces from
    spacious indie rock to disco-punk within the first minute, mixing
    dreamy female vocals with ferocious male screams. From there we're
    thrown into ""Post-Scarcity Sing-a-Long""-- Latin-tinged indie pop that,
    despite the name, doesn't offer much in the way of a sing-a-long.</p><p>
    Those songs showcase the band's ability to effortlessly switch between anger and sweetness, so it's a shame that the group also seems to trade in memorable
    melodies for musical oddities. This is especially a problem in the
    album's middle section. ""Unnamed Acoustic Songs"" features a sitar,
    but that might be the only thing to make it stick in your mind, as
    it's essentially the same line repeated ad nauseam over acoustic
    strumming and, well, then there's the sitar. ""Glosbos Illuminados"" is
    a generic, noisy blues number that sounds like the song during which
    you hit the bathroom and then grab a beer. Even worse, the band
    forays into honky-tonk with ""Everybody Lets Me Down"", complete with
    tinkling piano and banjo. It's not that there's anything wrong with
    tinkling piano and banjo; it's just that it starts to feel like the
    band has an identity crisis after a few of these departures.
    </p><p>
    But by ""The Romantic One"", things are back on track, and even though
    the track has a little in common with ""Glosbos Illuminados"", this
    time the cyclical guitar in the background and vocal shrieks pull it
    out of the barroom muck. ""Flannery's Coming Home"", the album's funky
    and melodic closer, is the most uplifting track here, ending things
    on a positive note. Any band that leans this heavily on
    experimentation is bound to have a few failures. But we try to
    forgive and move on, and focus on the successes. With <em>Catapult
    Calypso</em>, you might be bored by the lows, but that only makes the
    highs that much higher.

Maybe this was always a ""fake"" lo-fi album, though, about the aesthetic's endeavors and limits: Much of the playing seems forcedly ""bad"" to the point of risking annoyance. ""Revolution"" is a near exact rip of an early Pavement tune. The refrain of the limp waltz ""Saddestroyer"" is, ""I heard you were guided by voices."" The ballad-with-a-heart-murmur ""Rose"" announces, ""Static means punk/ Tuning is junk."" The kiddie instruments, stilted strumming, aborted-banshee melodica, and somnolent vocals accrue to imply that Bejar was consciously handicapping his folk (just as he synthed out his rock for <em>Your Blues</em>). That several choruses rise from the wreckage to have a kind of muted-sea-shanty power is testimony to his talent with incidental hooks.</p><p>
    Bejarologists will find most of the touchstones of Bejar's later work evident: Impressively clever puns, odes to lost mini-empires, the juxtaposition of the grandly axiomatic with the penetratingly personal, songs containing other bands' names and lyrics. Four songs even bear the titles of staples by the Beatles, Bruce Springsteen, Judas Priest, and Kenny Rogers &amp; Dolly Parton. Is Bejar paying homage with these gestures? Is he snubbing the notion of a word or phrase being ""owned"" and thus unusable forevermore? Can he not be bothered with maintaining a burden of freshness for its own sake? Or is he just acknowledging how much of his brainspace is crowded with late-20th century English-language rock and pop?</p><p>
    Listeners might find themselves thinking too much about Bejar's American counterpart, another seductive nerd about whom little is cartoonish: Stephen Malkmus. Both use a language-poetry approach to lyrics, both can bounce vocally from sexiness to whininess to sexy whininess to whiny sexiness, and both telegraph an inability to commit to either playing the role of artist or entertainer (bringing to mind a mantra from a David Berman poem: ""anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship""). Malkmus used to act bummed when people would ""whooo"" his solos or the opening of ""Grounded"", and Bejar often denies his audiences the cathartic ""fucking maniac"" line from ""European Oils"". The central tension of both songwriters' really-early work results from the lengths to which they'd go to try to bury their popcraft like a treasure they didn't want anyone to find without making enough effort.</p></div>"|9594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9594-well-build-them-a-golden-bridge/|6.5|William Bowers

Okay, maybe ""renaissance"" is a little strong. Non-ragga Jamaican music never went anywhere-- VP's <em>Strictly the Best</em> compilations have given space to post-Bob Marley roots and lover's rock for years. And ""conscious"" dancehall has never been a contradiction; some JA deejays seem to flip 'tween consciousness and nastiness on a yearly, or even record-by-record, basis.</p><p>
    But the moderate worldwide success of Damian Marley's 2005 single ""Welcome to Jamrock"" was a good journalist's hook on which to hang a movement. ""Jamrock"" might have you imagining thundering records full of Public Enemy-style political rhetoric or Rastafarian pronouncements of the Lord's judgment. But on the evidence, neo-roots really means lover's rock, the frothy, bong-bubbling sound of reggae love songs, whether sung to a lady or a weed sack. That makes Turbulence's ""Notorious"", <em>Serious Times</em>' opening track, an anomaly. On ""Notorious"", the low-end is more Decatur than Kingston; it has  the same forceful, hip-hop-derived oomph as ""Jamrock"", without sounding a thing like it. And <em>Serious Times</em> could have done with a few more tracks with the same righteous gangsta lean.</p><p>
    There are certainly other highlights, though. QQ's ""Poverty"" is the best single made by a grade school kid in eons. Another Bad Creation may have swung its beat on the playground, but QQ bounces to a tradition that stretches back to Althea and Donna's ""Uptown Top Ranking"" if not ""Iko Iko"", with a little prepubescent sociopolitical theory besides. Perfect's ""Hand Cart Boy"" is plain charming, especially when he claims that he knows he may not have the ducats but his lady is still ""coming home to [his] little hut."" But the difference between this and Junior Byles' ""Curly Locks"" is like the difference between, I don't know, Marvin Gaye and T-Pain.
    </p><p>
    I don't say that by way of disparaging Perfect or the neo-roots movement, merely to set the context. Perhaps it's being raised in the boisterous world of 21st century dancehall, where everything-louder-than-everything-else is the quickest way to make an impact at a booming sound system party, but these singers never murmur or coo. They almost always sound like they're shouting. Maybe in 2006, especially in a place as rough and tumble as Jamaica, even love songs can't relax. Sizzla, heard here on ""Ain't Gonna Fall"", has made a career out of sounding moved to the brink of breakdown, his voice cracking and crackling with romantic or religious hysteria.
    </p>
<p>
    The music, likewise, always sounds like it's shouting, right down to the dancehall-style sirens and gunshots and vinyl spinbacks Glazer punches in throughout his mix. There's little of the, well, rootsiness of roots reggae. Some tracks, with their basic dub bass lines and over-the-counter skanks, sound like what the lab coats at ProTools might cook up between World of Warcraft games for the ""reggae"" setting. It's almost too easy to praise old school reggae for its earthiness 'cause it was recorded on a four-track in a shack, and it's equally too easy to diss modern (non-dancehall) reggae for being synthetic because computers are cheap even in places with no Wal-Marts. But even as a fan of some of the most synthetic music imaginable, I find myself frequently cringing at <em>Serious Times</em>' ersatz horns and other ersatz whatnot.
    </p>
<p>
    And again, I don't say this to set up some bullshit fake/real thing, a reversal of the way so many new school critics diss neo-soul because it doesn't sound like it was banged out in Fruity Loops in a ghetto basement. Comparing <em>Serious Times</em> to classic Studio One sides is a mug's game, like bitching that D4L isn't Outkast. Lovelorn dreads may not speak directly to <em>your</em> experience, but they're speaking to someone. Sure, we're broke, in political turmoil at home, and somehow once again jousting with nuclear warheads-- and if you think you've got it bad, probably reading an internet music site in school or at work, folks down Yard probably have it much worse-- but people are still falling in love. Even at its saddest and most serious, Jamaican music has stressed public communion and joyful abandon-- in other words, it's about getting people together to dance, and hopefully think a little, too. <em>Serious Times</em> may be a glossy throwback-- if that's not a contradiction in terms-- but play it for a roomful of dancers and it's sure to get the air horns blowing.<br/>

    The Skygreen Leopards are one of the charter franchises of the prolific Jewelled
    Antler Collective, so it's probably redundant to mention that group members
    Glenn Donaldson and Shayde Sartin have lately been involved in recording with
    several extracurricular side projects. Two of these records-- Wooden Wand and
    the Sky High Band's <em>Second Attention</em> and Flying Canyon's self-titled
    debut-- are germane to the discussion of the Leopards' latest, <em>Disciples of
    California</em>. When considered together, these three albums form a symmetrical
    trilogy of sun-dazed Americana, complementary enough to have been conceived
    around the same Mendocino County fire ring. And though all this extra activity
    puts the Skygreen Leopards at risk of diluting their own album's overall
    impact, <em>Disciples of California</em> succeeds on the cumulative strength of
    the group's songcraft, inventive musicianship, and their unforced, wholly
    infectious <em>esprit de corps</em>.</p><p>
    On <em>Disciples of California</em>, the Leopards have begun to edge away from
    the florid acid-folk expression of 2005's charming <em>Life and Love in
    Sparrow's Meadow</em>. Always the most melodic and overtly poppy of the Jewelled
    Antler groups, the Leopards' music here increasingly takes on a gentle but
    distinct cosmic-country twang, guided by the hushed voices of Donaldson and
    veteran multi-instrumentalist Donovan Quinn. Recorded virtually live in the
    group's own studio, the album's spacious sound takes advantage of the Skyband
    rhythm section of drummer Jasmyn Wong and bassist Sartin. Organic improvisation
    has always been a crucial Jewelled Antler hallmark, but here the Leopards have
    put a newfound emphasis on disciplined choreography, reportedly even going so
    far as to enlist modern dance instructor Vaslav Treacy to help them hone and
    focus their graceful, shambolic pulse.</p><p>
    As with Wooden Wand's <em>Second Attention</em>, the Leopards' songs here are
    liberally sprinkled with oblique biblical references, most explicitly on the
    central track ""Jesus Was Californian"" (I'm guessing the Kris
    Kristofferson allusion is no accident, either.) While this song's theological
    intent is murky, lines like ""Jesus drank by the ocean/ And slept through
    your tent revival"" might indicate a desire to reclaim a sense of
    religion's essential humanity and mysticism. Further spiritualist pilgrimages
    are made on ""William &amp; the Sacred Hammer"", on which the narrator
    brings all of his ""virtues and sins"" to the mysterious sage
    ""Willie"" while a lonesome pedal steel cries in the middle distance.
    Elsewhere, ""Sally Orchid"" and its follow-up ""I Remember Sally
    Orchid"" voice an almost prayerful devotion to a beauty who may or may not
    be an actual ghost, with Donaldson and Quinn joining their whispers to ask
    earnestly, ""How many stones in the temple are you haunting?""
    </p>
<p>
    But the Leopards save their most potent hymns (and their purest melodies)
    for such decidedly pro-California cuts as the Gram Parsons shuffle ""Places
    West of Shawnapee"" or the beatific title track. Here and throughout
    <em>Disciples of California</em>, they pay reverent homage to their home state largely
    by drawing broadly from its musical heritage, their songs bearing the dreamy echoes
    of Buffalo Springfield, vibrant Bay Area psychedelia, and Bakersfield
    country-rock. Lacking a vocalist as charismatic as Wooden Wand's James Toth or
    Flying Canyon's Cayce Lindner, the Skygreen Leopards instead often have to get
    their dusky spirit texts across though their deftly woven melodies and sheer
    communal drive. And as <em>Disciples of California</em> ably illustrates, these are
    qualities conveniently reserved in abundance within the Leopards' Pacific
    nation.

    Micah P. Hinson's earlier records leaned on his weathered, husky voice that belies his young age. I don't often invoke my colleagues at
    Pitchfork, but the reviewers before me have been astute-- both Stephen
    Deusner's comparison of Hinson to Willie Nelson, and Brian Howe's assertion
    that whether Hinson was raised by snake-handlers or worked at the local food
    court, his music would still bleed authenticity. Hinson's low, near-monotone
    singing is as human as Nelson's, but not as approachable or everyman; there's
    some intangible but obvious sadness in the hoarse creak at the edges of his syllables.
    It's easy to believe he's been through something most of us haven't, something
    we'd be able to see in his eyes just as we hear it in his voice.</p><p>
    In contrast to the starkness of his earlier records, the backing band on <em>Micah
    P. Hinson and the Opera Circuit</em> arrives with arrangements that are bolder,
    busier, and more often, a whole lot happier. After a lulling starry-night
    sing-along called ""Seems Almost Impossible"" opens on an unassuming
    note, a kick drum playfully smacks the two and four behind the banjo plucking
    of ""Diggin a Grave"" before the entire band kicks in-- harmonica,
    accordion, a fiddle prancing through Eastern tones-- transforming this dour
    folk song into a stirring wake. Though the instrumentation is more apparent in
    the latter, it makes a huge difference in both tracks, as the strings swell
    preternaturally and fade away in all the right moments of ""Seems Almost
    Impossible"". The band sounds more confident, and in turn, so does Hinson,
    singing in a laconic, assured drawl.</p><p>
    ""Jackeyed"" is even more layered, with a multi-tracked Hinson
    sounding positively anthemic over a full horn section that weaves between
    Detroit and Mexico City for inspiration, as he insists ""everything will be
    better in a year"" and sounds like he actually believes it. More strings
    follow on the waltz of ""It's Been So Long"", where Hinson yells
    himself ragged, but it just makes him sound more hopeful, if a little
    beleaguered. 
    </p>
<p>
    But while the horns on ""Jackeyed"" or the high-collared,
    near-Victorian strings on ""Little Boys Dream"" add further
    palatability and moments of genuine surprise, they can't help but seem
    two-dimensional next to gut-punching solo performances like ""Drift off to
    Sleep"". Hinson sounds just as ragged as on the preceding track, but here
    it's more like a tennis-ball lump in his throat. Part of the reason the horns
    that squeal with joy on ""Letter to Huntsville"" work so well is
    because they come right after ""Drift off to Sleep"", pulling us out
    from the disc's emotional center. 
    </p>
<p>
    Hinson's learning to use his voice as another instrument, and yet his
    singing remains the focal point. This is especially apparent on ""You're
    Only Lonely"", where he uses a distorted microphone; it's the record's most
    insistent rock performance, but it falls utterly flat without Hinson so far in
    front of it. <em>Micah P. Hinson and the Opera Circuit</em> covers more ground
    and isn't as unilaterally melancholy as we're used to, though the record
    contains some of his best work. The arrangements seem to colorize rather
    than color Hinson's songs, but his talents work just as well-- maybe better--
    in black and white.

    Well that didn't last long. At this point in the career of
    26-year-old New England songwriter Damon McMahon, such an assessment seems
    somehow long overdue. Just after his short-lived, semi-buzz Brooklyn rock band,
    INOUK, released an LP, they called it quits, the sudden demise of their punchy,
    harmony-built guitar exclamations leaving some pundits holding their
    next-big-thing cards. The 10 tracks from his solo debut, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mansions, </span><span>make a similarly rapid entrance-cum-exit, together
    clocking in at just above 28 minutes. Dude doesn't dawdle.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Here, in the truncated, largely unadorned hallways and rooms
    of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mansions</span><span>, that's more often than not
    a plus. McMahon, who was writing solo guitar material as a teenager in Connecticut,
    pens the type of initially enamoring tokens that are comfortable and familiar,
    if occasionally humdrum. His simple acoustic guitar-- accompanied sometimes by
    bass and light percussion-- even feels trustworthy, referential of proven icons.
    Through McMahon's six strings, the grace of Nick Drake brushes against the
    bustle of early Billy Bragg. It's capable of being loved. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Likewise, McMahon's voice-- here, his greatest asset, just as
    in INOUK-- is magnetic. With an uncanny vibrato and an off-the-cuff rhythmic ease,
    he is casually convincing, as if confiding secrets that are new even to him. He
    toils through ""Honk Kong"" with a genuine dejection, but he bounces along
    ""Paradise Vacation"" with a carefully controlled hopefulness. And, when hooks
    happen, he nails them: ""Somewhere in France,"" the best and most exposing song
    here, boasts a perfect chorus, McMahon glowing as he sings about free living on
    the beach with his friends.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But these are songs that, even after being accepted to
    memory, say little about their subject and, ultimately, their author. These are
    simple, manageable tacks to nowhere. McMahon refuses to deliver much of
    significance, singing pretty melodies molded out of nothing.
    Expectation-defiant platitudes like ""You keep them wanting more/ 'cause son you
    got the gift/ And if you got it, give it to me"" hold the hooks high with
    pregnant expectation of verses, hopefully setting up something more than the
    sort of vagaries David Gray handles more poignantly. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But, when he gets image-specific inside the verses, it's again
    for naught: His allusions are either esoteric, sans-context memories or
    slightly curious, one-joke symbols. He relates reading French children's
    favorite <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Madeline </span><span>and lusty visages of
    Marseilles at dusk. The images, standing alone, neither communicate directly
    nor open the songs to interpretation and internalization. Alternately, during
    ""Elizabeth Taylor,"" McMahon calls Derek Khan-- a big-time fashion consultant and
    convicted small-time jewelry crook who became infamous when he was caught
    pawning gems he had ""borrowed"" for celebrity clients-- by name. He relates all
    the minutiae of that episode, from the $250,000 diamond he took in the name of
    Nicole Kidman to Khan's lavish habits, as though they mean something. But the
    details fail. When songwriters pass off tabloid clippings as ideological and
    emotional metaphors, the real picture doesn't stand a chance.<span> </span></span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But at least McMahon knows he's not saying much: Recorded in
    two days just before Christmas during a turbulent time for INOUK, these quick,
    simple takes seem to know they come up shallow. Indeed, albums of acoustic
    guitar and voice are often about intimacy, and at least this one tries. But
    after cozying up to <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mansions</span><span>' cold glow
    for days, it's still possible to see McMahon as a complete stranger, even
    though he pleads as though he'd like to be best friends. </span>

Ex-Warmers drummer Amy Farina and (former?) Fugazi frontman Ian MacKaye were still playing fiery leftist post-hardcore, but with a sort of quiet warmth, using acoustic guitars, rippling drums, and hushed, intimate harmonies. The two had an easy, gooey warmth in their interplay, and sounded happy even when they were singing about police brutality or gentrification. It was pretty easy to imagine most of the songs as Fugazi songs-- you could mentally fill in the spaces where the roaring guitar-spazouts and hypno-basslines might go-- but the amber glow of the record's analog hush also had some Helium in it, often sounding creaky and intimate.</p><p>
<em>
    Get Evens</em> is as quiet and pretty as its predecessor, but the effortless ease is gone, replaced by a sort of busy anxiety. These days, MacKaye is mostly playing backup to Farina, plucking out delicately minimal guitar figures while her busy, jittery brushwork runs in circles and fills the empty space. The duo keeps everything hushed, but the songs now seem poised to break out of themselves, as if their calm surfaces are hiding furious turbulence. This is new territory for MacKaye; nuance has never exactly been his thing, and sometimes I wish he'd do away with all the tricky digressions and let loose with one of his anthemic chorus-howls. But restraint adds a surprisingly potent shade of contained rage to the whole enterprise. MacKaye and Farina don't sound quite so comfortable anymore, and it's not hard to figure out why.</p><p>
    Lyrically, <em>Get Evens</em> is an election-year album; a couple of songs address powers-that-be more directly than anything MacKaye has done in years. ""Everybody Knows"" seems aimed at the Republican electorate currently clogging up the duo's hometown: ""You fabricated your way in here, and everybody knows."" The song builds to one of the album's few cathartic moments when MacKaye and Farina howl the triumphant conclusion: ""You're fired!"" And ""Dinner With the President"" is the sort of imagined-scenario song that folksingers used to do. MacKaye wonders why he's never been invited; he's right there in town and everything: ""I don't exist in their worldview/ But if I went, I know what I'd like to do/ Stand up and scream while the food is served."" That impotent frustration pops up again and again on the album, especially on opener ""Cut from the Cloth"", in which he sounds utterly disappointed: ""How do people sleep amidst the slaughter/ And why would they vote in favor of their own defeat?""
    </p><p>
    As on the last album, it's fun to hear MacKaye tempering his pit bull bark into a stunted mumble, but I wish he'd cede more of his lead vocals to Farina, whose shivery, crystalline soprano absolutely slices through everything around it. She and MacKaye have a chemistry so intuitive it feels biological, and when they launch into one of their high, gentle-harmony choruses, they nearly stop time. If Fugazi ever makes another record, I'd love to see Farina taken on as a full-time member.
    </p>
<p>
    But will Fugazi ever make another record? Years ago, MacKaye was comfortable with the cult of his personality; he looked perfectly natural on an outdoor stage in front of thousands, pointing at the Capitol behind with righteous, glowering contempt. But he looked happier last year playing to tiny crowds in art galleries, asking the audience to let kids to the front of the stage so they could see. With the Evens, he's fading from figurehead status with a grace that few could've predicted. I just wish someone would come along and fill the space he left.

    When Willie Nelson began his ascent to
    country music stardom in the 1970s, he managed to corral two types of fans. The first group was the rednecks, drawn to Willie's country sound and perhaps
    even his pedigree as the guy who wrote ""Crazy"" for Patsy Cline; and the second
    group was the hippies, who saw Willie as one of their own: a long-haired,
    scruffy-bearded pot-smoker with a propensity for traditional music. Thirty
    years later, Nelson's audience has expanded beyond those two polar
    demographics, and the man himself has become such an icon that he can put out
    lackluster albums like <em>Milk Cow Blues</em>
    or <em>Countryman</em> without taking a hit. So
    he's free to follow his muse wherever it leads, whether it's to Jamaica
    or to the Delta.</p><p>
    Or to Ryan Adams' doorstep. The former Whiskeytown frontman and indie
    gadfly has a little redneck in him, but a lot of hippie, and he's fashioned himself
    squarely in Willie's shadow: decisively rejecting genre tags, following his own
    schedule, and taking up the outlaw mantle. He makes for an interesting match
    for Willie-- not always a good match, but an interesting one. <em>Songbird</em>, which features Willie's
    typical assortment of covers and new takes on his own songs, shouldn't be as
    good as it is. Its flaws are obvious and mistakable, and yet, after a few
    listens, it becomes increasingly difficult to deny its warm vibe and easy, anything-goes sensibility.</p><p>
    Up close, it's a real mess. Adams'
    gloppy production disregards the natural rise and fall of Willie's distinctive
    voice and the odd cadence of his phrasing. As a producer, Adams
    adds too many guitars and just too much sound to these songs, such that Willie
    seems to get lost in the Grateful Dead cover ""Stella Blue"" and Gram Parsons' ""$1000
    Wedding"". And the gospel choir on ""Blue Hotel"" and ""Hallelujah"" (more on the
    latter later) seems crassly over the top. Furthermore, Adams' backing band, the
    Cardinals, create a sound as shaggy as Adams' haircut, taking as many
    liberties with meter and melody as Willie does but without exhibiting his grace,
    control, and subtlety. Too often they barrel over his vocals and guitar solos,
    especially toward the end of ""Hallelujah"". Only harmonica player Mickey
    Raphael seems attuned to Willie's style, but then, they've been playing together for
    decades.
    </p>
<p>
    So on one level, <em>Songbird</em>
    should be as much a disaster as last year's woeful reggae album <em>Countryman</em>, which seemed like just an
    excuse for Willie to get down to Jamaica. Part of this album's success is to Adams'
    credit. Honestly, I've always thought his off-the-cuff disposition was a put-on: His lack of an act seemed like an act in itself, and the messy spontaneity seemed more like an aesthetic
    choice than an unassuming, unpolished approach. But on <em>Songbird</em>, the spontaneity really does sound spontaneous. These songs have the warts-and-all demeanor of Willie's live show,
    mixing professionalism with creative joy as the musicians get caught up in the
    moment. ""We Don't Run"" and ""Rainy Day Blues"" are loose, percolating jams that
    sound like they were devised for demanding audiences. And credit Adams
    too with avoiding easy reverence: The redux of Willie's classic ""Sad Songs and
    Waltzes"" sheds the forlornness of the original and recasts it as a sly career
    commentary from a 73-year-old outlaw. 
    </p>
<p>
    But most of the credit belongs to Willie, who remains
    admirably game for any creative detour or experiment. I wouldn't be surprised
    if he teamed up with Timbaland next. Adams gives him an
    electric guitar and places him in a rock setting, but Willie meets him more
    than halfway. He alters his vocal approach dramatically, reaching a heartbroken
    climax on ""$1000 Wedding"" and a grim hopefulness on the closing ""Amazing
    Grace"". Fleetwood Mac's ""Songbird"" and his own composition ""Back to Earth""
    force him to hew closer to the melody, despite roughening up his voice. 
    </p>
<p>
    Like cohort Johnny Cash, Willie has made an impossibly long
    career by turning his limitations into strengths: His voice is thin but tender
    and surprisingly dexterous, and it hasn't aged a bit. So, the one song that
    seems most beyond his abilities is the most interesting on the album, if
    only for the challenges it presents. Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" may be the
    most overused song of the past few years, solemnly covered by Jeff Buckley,
    John Cale, Bono, and Chris Botti, and montaged to death on ""Scrubs""<em>, ""</em>House""<em>,</em> and ""The O.C.""
    Another interpretation by anyone, even Willie Nelson-- hell, <em>especially </em>Willie Nelson-- should be unbearable. However, with Raphael's harmonica setting the tone in
    the intro and the band recalling Willie's cover of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale""
    from 1982's <em>Always on My Mind</em>, this
    ""Hallelujah"" is noticeably different. And it's more than just the
    country-rock sound: Willie sings as though he deliberately wants to
    reinterpret the song, to claim its message of creativity and inspiration as his
    own. He makes great use of his lower register as he talks out the verses, and
    instead of sustaining the syllables on the chorus, he lets his voice waver into
    silence, reinstating the song's precarious sense of resignation and uncertain
    defiance. 
    </p>
<p>
    Here's where a less-is-more musical approach would seem like
    a no-brainer, but Adams mucks up the production,
    creating a wall of sound that towers over Willie. Atop that is a gospel
    choir that intones the song's chorus, but they sound completely out of place: This is a song for a lone singer, a solitary voice crying out for and against
    God. For a few minutes that's exactly what Willie gives us, and then that
    plaintive minimalism is exactly what Adams confounds. The
    song sounds unsettled, unsure of what either artist wants it to be. This collaboration
    is much the same: Nothing here sounds like it's been fully thought out
    or planned, and <em>Songbird</em> sounds all
    the better for it.

    Composer and producer Jean-Claude Vannier has spent much of the past few decades writing scores for French television and cinema, most of which have gone largely unheard outside Europe. Along the way he has also worked with pop artists such as Brigitte Fontaine and Françoise Hardy, but he remains most widely celebrated for his lavish arrangements on Serge Gainsbourg's classic jailbait concept album <em>Histoire de Melody Nelson</em>. Throughout his work, Vannier has displayed a fearless ambition to communicate a coherent narrative, primarily-- or even exclusively-- through his carefully programmed music. And never were Vannier's grandiose ambitions given freer reign than on his jawdropping 1972 solo debut <em>L'Enfant Assasin des Mouches</em> (<em>The Child Assassin of the Flies</em>). On this bizarre and astonishing album, which B-Music has now given its first official domestic release, Vannier uses every weapon in his considerable arsenal to craft a turbulent soundscape that deftly mirrors the endless commotion and confusion so peculiar to childhood.</p><p>
    Originally made available in only 100 promo copies, <em>L'Enfant Assasin des Mouches</em> has long been the stuff of legend amongst serious vinyl collectors, and it isn't difficult to hear why. In conducting the album's unruly pastiche, Vannier seems equal parts Van Dyke Parks and Carl Stalling, drawing impulsively upon multiple classical and soundtrack traditions, sleazy Euro-funk, Middle Eastern modalities, proggy hard rock, and what sounds like the full sound effects library of a large radio theater troupe. The piece's loose narrative structure is provided in the liner notes, written after the fact by Gainsbourg. This macabre little libretto-- which involves a young, fly-torturing child who receives his just desserts when lured down into the underground fly kingdom-- might be screwy enough to make <em>Tommy</em> read like Ibsen, but it does provide a suitably dramatic context for Vannier's violent, often jarring musical juxtapositions.</p><p>
    It seems a great understatement to say that <em>L'Enfant Assasin des Mouches</em> is exactly the sort of extravagant 1970s period piece that simply couldn't get produced today, even if someone had the studio resources and the sheer chutzpah to try. Without access to any of today's sampling technology, Vannier was forced to make all of his wild stylistic leaps in multi-tracked real time with real musicians-- employing a string quartet, the Jeunesse de France choir, a full horn section, and special effects ranging from billiard balls to a model helicopter. By using these live sound sources, Vannier was able to give the piece an impression of enhanced physical space and mass, as evident on the opening ""L'Enfant La Mouche Et Les Allumettes"" which shifts abruptly from an audio vérité intro of traffic and tolling church bells into a queasy, vertigo-inducing fog of reeds and roiling percussion. 
    </p>
<p>
    Later, on the majestic ""Danse Des Mouches Noires Gardes Du Roi"", Vannier combines lush, Morricone-like orchestrations and jazz piano in a manner that suggests something of the child's ability to retreat unseen into the world of imagination, an effect further amplified by the playful calliope of ""Danse De L'Enfant Et Du Roi Des Mouches"". Soon, however, events take a darker cast on ""Mort Du Roi Des Mouches"", with the protagonist's unwholesome treachery effectively conveyed via the intrusion of raunchy wah-wah guitars and overcast prog-rock atmospherics. By contrast, the closing miniatures ""Le Papier Tue-Enfant"" and ""Petite Agonie De L'Enfant Assassin"" appear tranquil and practically organic. The flies in their kingdom have apparently chosen to celebrate their eventual victory by indulging in a brief interlude of flute and French café accordion, bringing the tumultuous album to a remarkably peaceful conclusion, as though the world has been returned to a more natural state of order in the child's absence. 
    </p>
<p>
    The music on <em>L'Enfant Assasin des Mouches</em> can often seem so agitated and chaotic that it can become difficult to discern the figure of Vannier himself, unless the meticulously balanced discord can itself be taken to be his true signature. Occasionally the clouds do part enough to seemingly catch a recognizable glimpse of the artist, as when the choral passages of ""Les Gardes Volent Au Secours Du Roi"" provide a brief echo of <em>Melody Nelson's </em>""Cargo Culte"". By and large, however, Vannier best expresses himself by drawing hidden links between outwardly incompatible musical vocabularies, a strategy later to be reflected in the syncretic concepts of artists like Matmos, dj/Rupture, or Matthew Herbert. That Vannier was able to do so with such a high degree of melodicism, manic invention, and a contagious sense of wonder seems just so much extra frosting.

    Spanky Wilson is not new at this. She's been recording since 1967, with a
    résumé that includes seven solo albums and stints with Marvin Gaye, Jimmy
    Smith, Sammy Davis, Jr., Willie Bobo and Lalo Schifrin, among others. Will
    ""Quantic"" Holland is young enough to be her son, but in just under a
    decade he's already released and produced enough records for a whole career.
    The two have collaborated on a couple of Quantic tracks in the past, including
    the mighty ""Don't Joke With a Hungry Man"", which no less a funk
    authority than Keb Darge snagged for his <em>Kings of Funk</em> compilation with
    RZA a couple years ago.</p><p>
    Where Wilson previously figured as a guest of Holland, though, here she's
    the main attraction and the result is a backbone-slipping, hip-shaking,
    heavy-grooving funk monster that feels old school but sounds modern. With
    Holland in the producer/arranger's seat, the drums are crisp and deep in the
    pocket, the horns twist and stab, and Wilson gets a perfect environment for her
    direct, gritty vocals. She reportedly received the nickname Spanky from her
    father based on the frequency with which he had to discipline her. It's not
    hard to imagine-- judging by her voice, the woman has some serious sass in her.</p><p>
    They wisely reprise ""Don't Joke With a Hungry Man"" in two parts,
    one vocal and one instrumental, and both new versions are wickedly danceable,
    with a sliding bass line, scratchy guitar, and insane drums that skitter along
    with a metronomic tambourine as grounding. Holland's spy movie horns, played by
    a section that includes studio giant Phil Ranelin on trombone, get a chance to
    stretch out on the instrumental version. He bolsters the brass with spectral
    violins on the mid-tempo ""A Woman Like Me"" and goes with a more
    hip-hop beat for the Hurricane Katrina lament ""That's How it Was"", a
    nicely direct if occasionally heavy-handed remembrance and call for change. 
    </p>
<p>
    Oddly, the back of the album is more stacked than the front, and the late
    one-two of ""Message to Tomorrow"" and ""Waiting for Your
    Touch"" is a virtual clinic in slamming funk and tough soul. Wilson keeps
    her phrasing quick and clipped on ""Message"", avoiding melisma and
    riding the unstoppable train of locked-in drums and boiling wah-wah guitar.
    ""Waiting for Your Touch"" has a killer beat and bass line, with
    perfectly timed string accents and a funked-up horn riff, and the raw production
    lets Wilson carry the awesome vocal melody right up in your face on the sheer
    strength of her delivery. 
    </p>
<p>
    The classic years of funk (roughly, 1968 through 1973) always seemed way too
    short to me, and this record is yet another strong entry-- along with records
    by Sharon Jones, Antibalas, and the Poets of Rhythm-- in a revival that's well
    worth pursuing. That Wilson is making some of her best music four decades after
    hitting the scene with her legendary version of ""Sunshine of Your
    Love"" is heartening, and I hope we hear more from this pair in the
    not-too-distant future.

    Y'know, most self-released albums don't even make it
    this far. Earlier this year, Brooklyn foursome Takka Takka started offering a free
    EP for download over the internet; by the end of September, dudes were playing
    for thousands at Central Park in support of full-length debut <em>We Feel Safer
    at Night</em>, opening for fellow unsigned word-of-blog heroes Clap Your Hands
    Say Yeah. The bands once shared a member, and both acts exemplify the way DIY
    musicians are using the web to reach their audiences. Unfortunately, a business
    model isn't an aesthetic, as anyone who ever tried to explain ""indie
    rock"" to a non-listener knows.</p><p>
<em>We Feel Safer at Night</em>, true to its title, is a safe,
    practically suburban NYC indie record for the bum-free, post-Giuliani era.
    Singer/guitarist Gabe Levine sing/speaks like a nice brah from <em>Friends</em>
    doing his best Lou Reed deadpan, backed by lulling Phoenix-meets-Counting Crows
    acoustic rock (sorry, not quite the Rembrandts). ""She Works in Banking""
    uses a slick bassline and tingling soft-rock guitar suited for Fleetwood Mac's
    ""Dreams"", while ""Joshua and the Professor"" does choked-up
    goofball piano balladry in the earnest Ben Folds vein (<em>Reinhold Messner</em>,
    by the synths). But can they stand the sound of the Velvet
    Underground?</p><p>
    Takka Takka also stick to what's safest and most widely
    palatable when it comes to lyrics. Like recent John Mayer single ""Waiting
    on the World to Change"", harmonica-laden ""Enough""
    addresses the war in Iraq from a smug, uncontroversial distance: ""The
    protest kids are protestin'/ But they forget that the movement's been dead for
    years."" The topic gets a more direct treatment on ""Living Out of
    Trouble"", this album's ""Details of the War"" for its
    Dylan-drenched slo-mo, but the track never quite departs the coziness of
    cliché; Levine suggests we can't hear the gunshots because our TVs are on too
    loud. Yeah, dudes, I've kinda had enough of the blame-<em>American-Idol</em>-first
    crowd. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's tough to actively dislike these guys, though, when
    even they seem to realize how lucky they are. With Kinks la-la-las and
    handclaps, ""They Built You Up Too Fast"" could be a comment on the
    phenomenon of hype itself. ""I'll be sure not to say your name at
    all,"" Levine pledges over more acoustic guitars, as if safeguarding a
    beloved mp3 from the cred-besmirching white-earbud masses. It's the type of
    song bands could play in sports bars or nightclubs anywhere in the country. No
    one can say for certain whether Takka Takka's self-released debut would've even
    made it to New York if the band didn't already call the city home, along with most of
    their buzzed-about peers who aren't from Austin or Los Angeles. I thought the democratization of music on the internet was supposed to increase
    geographical diversity.  Apparently, we're all from the outer boroughs.

    Stephen Malkmus writes in the liner notes of the expanded 2xCD
    reissue of <em>Wowee Zowee</em> that many of his friends like this Pavement record
    best. In 2006, that's not a crazy notion: <em>Wowee Zowee</em> was Pavement's <em>White
    Album</em>, a little bit of everything thrown together, and as with the Beatles'
    double, its adherents prefer the band at its loosest, funniest, and most willing to
    do whatever pops into their heads.</p><p>
    But I wonder what S.M.'s friends thought when <em>WZ</em> was
    released in April 1995. Press reviews at the time were mixed, and a lot of
    Pavement fans were disappointed. After the faintly commercial move of <em>Crooked
    Rain, Crooked Rain</em>, with its alt-rock hit single and coherent set of
    fully realized songs, <em>Wowee Zowee</em> seemed a retreat, a record that took
    the slacker ethos to heart and didn't bother much with songwriting. It
    possessed none of the key virtues of their first two full-lengths. <em>Slanted
    and Enchanted</em>, like the singles that preceded it, was unfocused but filled
    with mystery, a cloudy shape outlining a great band in the process of becoming.
    And <em>CR, CR </em>was clear and direct, bursting with melody, the sound of vast
    potential and supreme confidence fully realized. But <em>Wowee Zowee</em> was
    scattered, jokey, maybe even trivial; the band had tipped its hand and some
    were seeing a bluff.</p><p>
    But further listens and
    passing time improved the sound of <em>Wowee Zowee</em>. The original A,
    stretching from ""We Dance"" to ""Serpentine Pad"", may be the
    best album side they ever managed. And the strangely effective construction of
    Malkmus' songs bring to mind a question that wasn't asked the first time around:
    What if he wasn't screwing around, but instead was bored with where he'd been
    and looking for a new songwriting language? He found one, at any rate, and it
    all centered on his guitar. Malkmus never played better than he did here,
    though he didn't solo much. Instead, he let the guitar serve as the duet
    partner that Spiral Stairs never was, using breathtakingly melodic lines to
    serve as a chorus of sorts on ""Black Out"", ""Grounded"",
    ""Pueblo"", and ""Flux=Rad""; all have a guitar part at their
    center in a place where another songwriter might have put a vocal hook.
    </p>
<p>
    The best songs on <em>Wowee Zowee</em> are slower and
    more meandering than what came before, and only give a passing glance to things
    like chorus, bridge, or meaning. As far as the latter, Malkmus was obviously
    picking words mostly by how they sounded, which by and large worked out great.
    An occasional line pops out and you're not sure if it's great or terrible--
    ""Pick out some Brazilian nuts for your engagement/ Check the expiration
    date, man, it's later than you think"" from ""We Dance"" springs to
    mind, sung in a faux-Brit accent reminiscent of the Frogs-- but you wind up
    remembering those phrases, and the melodies in which they're wedged. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are a few throwaways-- don't have much
    use for ""Extradition"", ""Fight this Generation"", and
    ""Western Homes""-- but such goofs were part and parcel with Pavement,
    at least up to this point. Their final two records would contain only
    fleshed-out songs and are accordingly less favored by fans. <em>Wowee Zowee</em>
    was also the first and only time Spiral Stairs had a song (""Kennel
    District"") that, though much more conventional, was every bit as good as
    anything Malkmus managed. 
    </p>
<p>
    As with the reissues of their first two records, this
    edition of <em>Wowee Zowee</em> comes with non-album B-sides rounding out the first
    disc, and a second CD of outtakes, radio shots, live songs, and
    compilation tracks. With the main album including an additional half-dozen
    songs compared to its predecessors, the quality of the B-sides is suspect compared to previous Pavement reissues-- though ""Kriss Kraft"" and ""Mussle Rock (Is a Horse in
    Transition)"" (the second best song Spiral Stairs ever wrote) are easily
    good enough to fit on the album proper, and the entire <em>Pacific Trim </em>EP
    borders on great. 
    </p>
<p>
    Disc 2 is a tougher slog. Some of the
    compilation tracks are good-- ""Sensitive Euro Man"" from the <em>I Shot
    Andy Warhol </em>soundtrack has an easy tunefulness, and ""No More
    Kings"" from the <em>Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks </em>compilation reveals
    Pavement as the primo interpreters of Generation X arcana, making the
    educational cartoon song sound like something the band wrote, thick with a
    playful sense of nostalgia. But I can't imagine why anyone would prefer
    alternative versions of songs like ""Kris Kraft"", ""I Love
    Perth"" (both live in BBC studios), ""Heaven Is a Truck"", or
    ""Best Friend's Arm"" (live in Australia). But these misses are
    keeping, I suppose, with the spirit of Matador's ambitious reissue project, so
    we have to take the bad with the good. And when you're talking Pavement in 1995
    and 1996, there's no question, you're talking very, very good.

Asch gave Smith a $200 advance to compile a three-volume anthology of American folk music, fed him peyote buttons, and set up an office for Smith in the Folkways building on West 46th Street in midtown Manhattan.</p><p>
    Smith's compulsion to collect was pathological (he also boasted a trove of 30,000 Ukrainian Easter eggs), and he is typically defined via varying euphemisms for weird-- Moe Asch's biographer, Peter Goldsmith, describes Smith as a man ""…whose extraordinary intelligence and creativity could be both highly disciplined and hopelessly broad-ranging,"" while Robert Christgau accurately christens him ""a strange, bearded little man."" In 1952, Folkways released <em>The Anthology of American Folk Music</em>, a collection of folk, blues, and country songs from the 1920s and 30s, culled from Smith's personal collection and ranging from the relatively popular (the Carter Family, Lightnin' Hopkins, Dock Boggs, Blind Lemon Jefferson) to the obscure (Didier Herbert, Nelstone's Hawaiians, Coley Jones). <em>The Anthology</em> was considered sacred work to the folk revivalists of the late 1950s-- over a half-century (and a CD reissue by Smithsonian Folkways) later, Smith's box is still considered the premiere American folk collection available for public purchase. Allen Ginsberg rightfully dubbed it ""a historic bomb.""</p><p>
    Between 1999 and 2000, producer Hal Willner and Meltdown Festival artist-in-residence Nick Cave staged a series of epic five-hour-plus concerts in London, New York, and Los Angeles, intending to celebrate Smith's work as an experimental filmmaker and musicologist by pairing contemporary artists with bits of Smith's films and <em>The Anthology</em>'s ancient folksongs: Beck, Beth Orton, Phillip Glass, Van Dyke Parks, Elvis Costello, Wilco, Steve Earle, Lou Reed, Marianne Faithfull, and a mess of other artists agreed to participate. <em>The Harry Smith Project</em> documents the concerts, pairing two CDs of live cuts with a DVD of concert footage (some featuring the legendary camera-stylings of D.A. Pennebaker and his team) and <em>The Old, Weird America</em>, a documentary about the global endeavor.
    </p><p>
    Working musicians cover <em>The Anthology</em>'s songs all the time, and <em>The Harry Smith Project</em> isn't the first time modern stabs have been documented in deference-- Smithsonian Folkways released <em>The Harry Smith Connection</em> in 1997, the soundtrack to a pair of tribute concerts held in Vienna, Virginia to celebrate <em>The Anthology</em>'s CD reissue (featuring tracks by Dave Van Ronk, Jeff Tweedy, The New Lost City Ramblers, and others.) Still, many of these songs are so specific to their time and place-- Beale Street, dusty Delta crossroads, southern chain gangs, Appalachian cabins, Tennessee coal mines-- that a contemporary re-creation, no matter how well-intentioned or well-rendered, still feels a little ridiculous, like stomping through Colonial Williamsburg eating a hot dog and wearing a baseball cap. And while plenty of the cuts on <em>The Anthology</em> were ""covers"" to begin with (most early country and folksongs were re-workings of traditional gospel songs), they were captured at a time when folk music functioned a little bit differently-- when it was a vital and necessary method of documenting and lamenting the daily struggles of the poor, and not yet a political tool or floppy, coffeehouse luxury. Consequently, <em>The Harry Smith Project</em> works best as homage: These songs are buried treasure, beloved not only for their melody and performance, but for what they indicate about an America long obliterated. It's always nice to hear them honored (and to appreciate their songcraft without being distracted by rudimentary production techniques), but plenty is lost in translation. 
    </p>
<p>
    Howling the Carter Family hit ""Single Girl, Married Girl"", Petra Haden never quite captures Sara Carter's strained desperation (Sara's husband, Carter patriarch A.P., was notoriously absent; Sara later left him for his cousin, quit the band, and moved to California), sounding weirdly jubilant instead. Wilco's take on Richard Rabbit Brown's ""James Alley Blues"" is rich and convincing, with Jeff Tweedy grumbling on point, all sad-faced and earnest: ""Towns right now ain't nothing like they used to be/ I'll tell you all the truth/ Won't you take my word from me/ I seen better days and I ain't putting up with these."" Beck's version of Robert Johnson's ""Last Fair Deal Gone Down"" features loads of sloppy slide and haphazard, soulful yelps, while the box's highlight is traditional cut ""Sail Away Lady"", performed by Uncle Bunt Stephens on the original Anthology, and rendered beautifully here by Van Dyke Parks and the Mondrian String Quartet.
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Harry Smith Project</em> inadvertently asks big questions about the state of contemporary blues and folk, and works as an honest, loving tribute to the songs that informed the musical sensibilities of countless performers-- and, hopefully, will lead its listeners straight back to the big, red box every American music fan should own.<br/>

    Hindsight is blind, and Peter and the Wolf's Red Hunter knows this: On his band's (proper) debut album<span style=""font-style: italic""> Lightness</span>,
    he recalls past relationships to praise them, not to bury them. Hunter
    idealizes, even canonizes, girls gone by, rendering them all good, and
    all the same. This is also true of his music: Hunter uses few
    instruments, though always in gorgeous combinations. The result is a
    great winter album-- one that sounds recorded over a snow day, as if
    Hunter and company holed up in a warm cabin and made a bricolage record, with half-remembered memories of
    people they may have never met as a lyrical influence. It's a small album that fills a room.</p><p>
    And I'm not sure why,  but I <em>see</em> the details of a room while I listen to <span style=""font-style: italic"">Lightness</span>-- smooth
    wood tables, warm air, natty wool rugs. Maybe it's because of the
    album's consistent textures: Hunter's roasted chestnuts voice (whose
    dryness  sounds a little like Cat Stevens's or Richard Buckner's), soft
    sighs, and organic percussion. On tracks such as ""Canada"" Peter and the Wolf sound like they recorded on thick analog tape, or through a
    microphone wrapped in merino, though Hunter's timbre stays low and
    woody. There are no drums on <span style=""font-style: italic"">Lightness</span>,
    so percussion is charmingly lo-fi-- the heel of a palm striking the back
    of a guitar, or four beans rattling in a cup. Delicate guitar picking
    moves each track, along with  ""oohhh""s and ""ahhh""s, which appear, murky
    or light, male and female, on almost every song.</p><p>
    This comes together on ""Safe Travels"", which begins with a little
    shaker and rising/falling sighs over hair-thin guitar chords. Here Hunter
    doesn't sing about ex-girlfriends, but keeps same general
    sentiment-- recalling the best in people he no longer knows. The
    rest of <span style=""font-style: italic"">Lightness </span>does the
    same for women who <em>are</em> in Hunter's life: ""Dear Old Robyn"", for example, is a
    sea shanty transposed to a touring band, a sort of ""Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)"" for dudes
    on the road. ""I love you dear old Robyn/ I loved you all along/ To
    you I leave every word and every song,"" he and a pretty female voice
    sing together over bare guitar, about ""a love that will never come to
    be.""</p><p>
    On other songs, Hunter pines over fleeting love. Who are these
    girls, by the way, who salsa dance gracefully (""Silent Movies""), float
    through the window like the Virgin Mary (""Bonsai Tree""), and are worth
    waiting 10,000 years to meet (""The Owl"")? By likening them to Mary (she's mentioned in ""Grey
    Overcoat"" as well, where he and a girl kiss under a statue of ""Mary,
    white and good""), Hunter views them as eternally kind, never drunk or
    dating his best friend-- after all, he's comparing them to a woman who was born and died without sin. On the quaint ""Silent Movies"", Hunter
    sings, ""Do you ever think of me when he's boring you?/ I bet you do"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Or maybe she's reminded of
    him because<span style=""font-style: italic""> </span>Hunter
    bores as well. That's the problem. The horn line in ""Safe
    Travels"" reminds us of the  monotone that otherwise pervades <span style=""font-style: italic"">Lightness</span>. It's pretty much just vocals, guitar, and an egg shaker.  Most of<span style=""font-style: italic""> Lightness</span>'s
    16 tracks don't cross the three-minute mark, and with so many sketches
    for so many sweethearts, it needs more variation. Only the bluesy,
    weird ""Black Saltwater"" and ""Captain Dan""-- with its oil drum percussion
    and spiky electric guitar-- stray from the album's repetition. But its insular quality is a positive, too. Hunter has played shows in

That was Cee-Lo on the 2004 space-funk workout ""I Am Selling Soul"". Two years later, Cee-Lo is dressing up like Darth Vader and covering the Violent Femmes in Gnarls Barkley, and I wonder how he feels about making crackers happy these days.</p><p>
    Gnarls Barkley, is, of course, the reason this quickie best-of exists. While other mid-1990s rap veterans thrash around trying to find ways to stay relevant in an increasingly perilous and unpredictable commercial landscape, Cee-Lo has found platinum success and a receptive audience for his scratchy helium-gospel lisp and his self-consciously freaky alien-loverman persona. It wasn't a preordained fate by any means; even his old Dungeon Family compatriots Outkast are now struggiling to push their voices forward without driving their fans away. For years, Cee-Lo was Southern rap's resident weirdo, the guy who talked about the Velvet Underground in interviews and thanked Portishead in liner notes, but who still absolutely wrecked in a battle-rap context.</p><p>
    As one-fourth of the great Atlanta group Goodie Mob, Cee-Lo's slippery lightspeed chirp worked as a perfect foil for the deep, measured drawls of the other three, and he could howl out a furiously soulful chorus whenever needed. The group's first two albums, 1995's <em>Soul Food</em> and 1998's <em>Still Standing</em>, are completely essential. But after 1999's pretty-good <em>World Party</em> fell short of its obvious pop-crossover goals, Cee-Lo left the group and recorded a pair of uneven solo albums. 2002's<em> Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections</em> and 2004's <em>…Is the Soul Machine</em> both have great moments, but each feels like the work of someone struggling against formal constraints and staying blissfully unaware that those constraints were a huge part of what made him great. As a rapper, Cee-Lo was one of the best working. As an omnivorous mad-scientist Prince-wannabe who sometimes rapped, he needed some work. But now that he's apparently left rap behind completely and his name is ringing bells, Arista has raided both of those solo albums for this completely inessential collection.
    </p><p>
    Cee-Lo's short-lived solo career only yielded two singles that could even charitably be described as hits. They're both here, of course, front-loaded at the beginning of the album, and they both sound great. <em>Perfect Imperfections</em>' ""Closet Freak"" is a tense, jittery disco vamp that explodes into a ridiculously huge funk orgy halfway through. And <em>Soul Machine</em>'s ""I'll Be Around"" is an irresistibly sidelong Timbaland percussion-storm, though Timbaland improbably outraps Cee-Lo on his quick guest verse. 
    </p>
<p>
    If Cee-Lo had made another 15 tracks like those two, this album would be a godsend. But both of those albums came loaded down with half-baked funk experiments, exactly the sort of things that best-of albums are supposed to weed out. No such luck; this one makes room for the barely-there dub-bop excursion ""Bass Head Jazz"" and the plinky calliope-laced circus-rap ""Childz Play"", and the loose fake-Isaac Hayes spoken-word dissolve ""Sometimes"". None of those songs are terrible, but none of them warrants iPod space either. A few of the tracks <em>are</em> actively awful: ""The Art of Noise"" is the Neptunes at their dinky Vegas lounge-swinger worst, and ""Grown Man"" is a bit of cloying, boring jam-band fake-jazz nonsense. 
    </p>
<p>
    On a handful of songs, though, Cee-Lo does exactly what he hoped to do in going solo; he takes his rap virtuosity far outside the genre's boundaries and finds unprecedentedly fierce ways to explode boxes. ""Evening News"" is the sort of track that DJ Premier never makes anymore, a restrained but psychedelic leap into the jazz-noir ether; Cee-Lo coos and moans and screeches and then all of a sudden launches into a shockingly harsh battle-rap verse before returning to the crushed-velvet loverman flourishes. And ""I Am Selling Soul"" starts out as surprisingly great spoken-word space-disco with rippling Latin-funk drums, shivering strings, and tricky little jungle breakdowns, and then it stops without warning and morphs into slow, vicious dub-rap as Cee-Lo rails about art-vs.-commerce frustration: ""There is no part of me that can't be calculated into commodity.""
    </p>
<p>
    But the most poignant part of <em>Closet Freak</em> comes in its last two tracks, a pair of prime cuts from the first Goodie Mob album: the woozily organic ""Soul Food"" and the creepily paranoid ""Cell Therapy"". Even at his best, solo Cee-Lo still has yet to come close to the easy transcendence he found with his old crew. Back then, he wasn't content to bitch about rap from the sidelines; he was too busy making it better. Last year, the Goodie Mob, who had soldiered on to diminishing returns without Cee-Lo, announced that they'd be reuniting and even recorded a new song on the Big Boi's <em>Got Purp? Vol. 2</em> compilation. But now that he's touring with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and playing European festivals, Cee-Lo's been silent on the subject. I think that's crazy. <br/>

    Jersey Shore,"" says writer John Hodgman in his story ""Slingshot"", and
    I'm sure he's right. If there's one thing understood by every fan or
    contributor of the long-running <span class=""Apple-style-span"">Public Radio International</span> radio program ""This American Life"", it's
    exactly how to construct a story, where to place the metaphors, how to
    frame the character-- as a tragic hero, an ironic fool, or what
    have you-- and most important of all, how to hit the ""gotcha"" moment, the
    punchline or revelation that sends the story home. I'm not saying ""TAL""<em> </em>has
    a formula, but it definitely has a toolkit, and the show's contributors know
    how that kit works-- and they are hyper-aware, probably <em>too </em>self-aware, of the fact that they're using it.</p><p>
    Take the first two stories on ""TAL""'s third anthology, <em>Stories of Hope and Fear. </em>Jorge
    Just recalls the moment he realized he's a nobody: He watches someone
    who resides in his building get kicked off ""The Bachelorette"" for living in a
    shitty apartment. Just, who has an even shittier apartment one floor
    up, has been judged by a reality TV show. What a world! Next up is
    Jonathan Goldstein, far and away the most self-conscious and boorish
    person in the set. Goldstein strategically tells us how he used to
    think he'd make a great stand-up comic, and then carefully, with
    sniper-like precision, delivers the humiliating joke that made his dream
    go poof. Get it?</p><p>
    Now, that's not to pick on Goldstein or Just. After all, it's
    tempting to think ""TAL"" should
    stick to people who are ""authentic""-- who aren't professional writers,
    and don't pitch stories to radio shows. But that's bullshit. Everybody
    knows what makes a good story: The<em> </em>laws of set-up and punchline, or set-up and heart-breaking revelation, have been wired into our heads. ""TAL""<em> </em>succeeds when it finds a story that's bigger than its teller-- that's <em>so </em>big, and <em>so </em>good, that no matter how well we think we know our facts ourselves, it just gets away from us.
    </p><p>
    That's also when host Ira Glass comes through for us. Sure, sometimes he
    talks too much, but he's a deft interviewer, and he knows what
    questions to ask-- as he proves brilliantly in ""The Babysitters"", in which
    two kids in the 1940s make up a babysitting gig as a way to get out
    of the house. A clever prank turns into a summer-long adventure, but
    the two elderly people who recall the story gradually reveal more
    important details, about the mother who drove them to it and the
    dysfunctional relationships that they never healed. The siblings may
    have shown up with a good story, but Glass leads them to a far better
    one.
    </p>
<p>
    But those remarkable, incredible stories are few here, especially compared to the previous CD collection, <em>Crimebusters + Crossed Wires</em>.  The lowest point comes with ""TAL""<em> </em>staffer
    Julie Snyder's story about the time her phone company overcharged her,
    and took 10 months to give her a refund. I listened to the whole thing,
    all 22 minutes, out of professional obligation, and also because I was
    waiting for a twist or a shock. But no, it's a story that's only
    rewarding to the teller, as a catharsis over some past
    frustration-- it could just as easily have been about a parking ticket
    she didn't deserve, or the time her neighbors kept making too much
    noise-- and at the end, I wanted to scratch that part of the CD so
    nobody would have to hear it again. It's the weakest link of the
    dud-speckled second disc, which also includes a David Sedaris story
    about a squirrel and a chipmunk that, while well-crafted, smacks of Ira
    Glass asking, ""What have you got for us this time?""
    </p>
<p>
    Sedaris' piece may be polished and writerly, but this ain't <em>The New Yorker</em>, and the best stories
    make us forget about craft altogether. David Wilcox's ""Living Inside the Box"", a monologue about his sister and his mother, is one of the
    saddest things I've ever heard. I mean, I was listening to it, and
    laughing, but then I saw where he was going-- oh man, I'm crying right
    now. And I don't mind if Wilcox knew exactly how to trick me with the
    set-up and wind me up for the ""gotcha."" Finally, I was too sucked in to care.

With the 2000 debut of that alias Ripatti surprised the world-- or, at least, the world of techno-shut-ins and internet obsessives-- with the deeply resonant, unabashedly romantic <em>Vocalcity</em>. Until then, Ripatti's work had been marked by its drift, nuance, and noncommittal stance-- it was all haze and no solid edge. With <em>Vocalcity</em>, an album true to its name, Ripatti revealed a vision of deep house shot through with swoons and aloof, seductive female voices; for many fans of his previous, greyscale work, hearing <em>Vocalcity</em> was like seeing in color for the first time.</p><p>
    Ripatti's next Luomo album, 2003's <em>The Present Lover</em>, was even more upfront; every song packed to the gills with shivering harmonics, breathy vocals, and digital goosebumps. At the time, bedroom producers were discovering not just rave but pop music, and vice versa-- when Kylie's <em>Body Language</em> emerged shortly thereafter, some critics alleged that the pop diva was taking after Luomo, whose star seemed on the rise. But somehow, nothing went the way it was supposed to. Caught up in contractual disputes, <em>The Present Lover</em>'s U.S. release was delayed for months after its European release, and what should have been Luomo's big, splashy entrance onto the pop stage turned out to be a lukewarm wading-in.</p><p>
    What's more, critics didn't fall all over <em>The Present Lover</em> the way they had <em>Vocalcity</em>. Who knows why-- maybe it was too poppy for their tastes, or maybe their enthusiasm flagged while they waited to be given the green light to write about the disc: American writers wishing not to alienate the album's publicists were forced to sit on the sidelines while the album came and went in Europe. Another three years on, and Ripatti's world has changed considerably. Force Inc., the label that first brought Luomo to fame, has gone under, and he no longer has ties with BMG, the major that fumbled <em>The Present Lover</em>.
    </p><p>
    So far, so sobering. But the surprise twist to this workaday story is that <em>Paper Tigers</em>, Ripatti's new Luomo album, released without much fanfare a few weeks back, is a glorious, outsized triumph of a record. On the one hand, it remains true to the diehard Luomo sound-- indeed, it bears more than a passing resemblance to this year's surprising Uusitalo disc <em>Tulenkantaja</em>, which sounded more like Luomo than the more ambient Uusitalo project. The same tricks are in play-- brittle, overbright synths that shed pixel-dandruff with every riff; convoluted digital effects that treat sounds as though a great, robotic hand were scrunching them up into a ball like so much waste-paper; breathy vocals playing peekaboo across the soundfield, cooing and whispering, disappearing and turning up somewhere else when you turn your head to catch them in action. (Call it the ""whack-a-mole"" school of vocal processing.) And of course, there's <em>that bassline</em>: Listners waiting for Ripatti to do something new with his low end should stop holding their breaths, because once again, we're treated to that same dubby underpinning, bouncing like a Bungee cord that stretches by fifths.
    </p>
<p>
    But <em>Paper Tigers</em> is also, in its own way, a total curveball. It's the most cohesive of any of Luomo's albums, by which I mean you can listen over and over again until you have no idea whether it's just beginning, or wrapping up, or pumping steadily through its middlemost densities. The hooks are less pronounced than on <em>The Present Lover</em>, but every track is very much its own song; Ripatti infuses traditional verse/chorus structures with his horizontal sense of sprawl until his tracks roll out like an endless, head-over-heels tumble.
    </p>
<p>
    The whole record seems wrapped up with the very act of pop listening; the songs are at once hook-heavy and just out of reach. Hearing them feels a little like trying to rescue the memory of a melody that lingers on the tip of your tongue, a teasing wisp of a lick. The songs are as solid-- and as sticky-- as cotton candy.
    </p>
<p>
    Rhythmically, Ripatti has never been better; in songs like the staggering ""Wanna Tell"" it sounds like he's trying to tell the story of a stop-start career in the stuttering advance of faltering house programming. And while for the most part the female voices Ripatti employs sound as they always have-- multitracked and harmonized six ways from Sunday-- they're more convoluted than ever, with one exception: ""The Tease Is Over"", whose simple, girlish vocals recall the Cardigans, of all people. ""The Tease Is Over"", of course, could well be the title of the album: Luomo is back, familiar and yet somehow freakier than ever.

But no one experienced the kind of prolonged commercial and critical success, at least in America, that Moby did.</p><p>
    This is boilerplate observation at this point, but it bears thinking about how something so odd could come to be. Even today Moby hardly lights up a camera, and 11 years later his breakthrough album sounds far from crossover-ready. But this was the 1990s, and a whole lot from that era no longer really makes sense. (Like it even did at the time.) In 1995, a shy, retiring, bald vegan who had been delivered unto the Lord and who made a prog-dance record-- and then a terrible ""punk"" one, and then one that became its own shorthand for a certain kind of turn-of-the-millennium album-- could actually become a star of the sort used to pimp sugar water and trousers. And of course he played<em> </em>live and put on a capital-S show, which counted for a lot in the decade of the travelling outdoor festival-- something you'll become all too aware of at the tail end of <em>Go: The Very Best of Moby</em>. It's a gag so good/bad I won't even bother giving it away.</p><p>
    And though Moby was very much in the public's mind before 1999's <em>Play</em> set up his retirement fund, that was the album that turned him into an unlikely superstar. So <em>Go</em> makes the polemical/practical (since it basically covers his ongoing tenure at V2) decision to take <em>Play</em> as Moby's for-all-intents-and-purposes Year Zero. <em>Play</em> wasn't an entirely new move for Moby; even as far back as his first hit single, ""Go"" (which receives a hey-it's-2006 Trentemøller update here), which sampled the eerie strings from the theme to ""Twin Peaks"", he had been making electronic music that had a muted, forlorn-but-anthemic quality, something <em>Play</em> also had in abundance. The difference was that <em>Play</em> was his most all-around listenable/palatable album for folks not so into hardcore dance, dabblings in jungle, or Mission of Burma covers. And so this combination of melancholy take-it-easy techno and turns at the mic was revisited again and then again on 2002's <em>18</em> and 2005's <em>Hotel</em>.
    </p><p>
    Though hindsight has proven that pairing early 20th century folk and blues recordings with late 20th century beat science (as on ""Honey"" here) wasn't quite the new idea many excitable press types thought at the time, it's worth remembering that <em>Play</em> was titled more toward Moby in nebbish-pop mode (as on ""South Side"" here). It's also telling that <em>Play</em>'s most foot-friendly track, ""Bodyrock"", is relegated to a remix on the bonus disc of <em>Go</em>. Time has been kinder to the songs of <em>18</em> (as on ""We Are All Made of Stars"" here) than I'd have initially expected, but I'm still not sure why I should be listening to this guy's semipop when I've still got all those Brian Eno albums and a finite amount of leisure time. Meanwhile, as album titles go, <em>Hotel</em> was a Christmas present to jerks and assholes like me everywhere. As someone for whom a three-star <em>Hotel</em> means I'm living like a Hilton sister, this is indeed the kind of dribbling rock-music-for-airport-Cinnabons that I expect to be playing in high rises I'll never set foot in. While it was probably laudable on some level that he resisted the urge to keep pimping the blues-plus-beat formula that helped make <em>Play</em> a <em>success d'publicité</em>, the flimsy rock songs (as on ""Beautiful"" here) and flimsy ambient electro-pop (as on ""Dream About Me"" here) that he's offered ever since are hardly what you'd call largesse towards your audience.
    </p>
<p>
    The main problem with this disc is overexposure. Approximately 900 million people bought <em>Play</em> and even those who didn't plunk down $12.99 never need to hear the damn thing ever again. (I just played ""Run On"", and suddenly I have a craving for a new dishwasher.) That album was Moby's ticket to some kind of contestable techno immortality and the whole of it works a treat much better than the hodgepodge of <em>Go</em>. But if you work in a record store with the injunction to ""keep things mellow"" before noon, you could do worse, I guess.<br/>

    The Pacific Northwest's long history of punk-inspired, female-fronted rock is, unsurprisingly, full of subversion, and the debut from Portland's Swan Island continues that tradition in spades. Like Sleater-Kinney, Swan Island cops its name from a freeway exit. But what sounds like it should be Portland's most fairy tale setting is actually an industrial park. Conspicuously void of swans and not an island at all, it's where your UPS packages go if you're never home to sign for them. Then there's the album's title, which inverts W.B. Yeats' apocalyptic prophecy in ""The Second Coming"". It's a gesture akin to spray-painting a big peace sign over all the doom and gloom of one of Modernism's indestructible monuments. But Swan Island's real trick is in the music. Infiltrating male-dominated genres such as heavy metal and classic rock, the band rocks monster riffs while deflating all the heaviness with disco-damaged rhythms.</p><p>
    That's not to say that Swan Island is another dance-punk retread. Drummer Vera Domini keeps the BPMs high with some hyperactive high-hat, but the music remains a distant cousin to the Gossip's four-on-the-floor beats or Erase Errata's dizzying propulsion. Instead, the band maps closer to S-K with its intricate guitar interplay. Guitarists Aubree Bernier-Clarke and Torrence Stratton's axe work is one of the album's biggest pleasures, particularly as the playing varies widely from song to song-- or even within a single song. On opener ""Crumble"", crunchy, Black Sabbath riffs sidle up next to jumpy leads. By contrast, ""Night Owl""-- the album's most polished pop gem-- finds Bernier-Clarke and Stratton trading plinking, reverb-soaked guitar lines.</p><p>
    Not only is ""Night Owl"" the album's most concise and memorable track, it also uncharacteristically finds vocalist Brisa Gonzalez recalling bittersweet memories: ""Our hearts conspired to fool our minds/ Tonight let's leave what's left behind."" On <em>The Centre Will Hold</em>, Gonzalez typically favors abstraction or agitpop over direct emoting. 
    </p>
<p>
    But that's hardly a bad thing: Swan Island have packed their debut with songs that are incendiary and dynamic without lapsing into cliché. For all of the classic rock influences that inform the band's sound, the group demolishes standard structure with songs that refuse to stay in one place for very long. ""Flew the Coop"", for example, twists and turns until Gonzalez warns of impending catastrophe, singing, ""The sky is falling/ The tide is rising."" If Swan Island's music at times borders on chaos, it is an exacting and tightly orchestrated version of it-- one that numbers them among the Northwest's most promising new bands.

    Finally, someone has found a unique angle for the
    execution of tired ""Southern"" tropes: be from New York! What a genius
    plan this sextet has concocted, to bring their hoedown-core to the nation's
    music-blog-and-press-hub so that typists and hypists don't have to (sigh) seek
    them out in the cultural landfill that is (yawn) non-New-York America, and then
    the band can bask in the boring language of this genre's typical, lazy,
    ghetto-izing reception: ""haunted,"" ""Appalachian,""
    ""swamp,"" ""mountain,"" etc. City slickers might be surprised
    by how unswampy most mountains are, and vice versa. Anyway, bits of the o'death boys'
    affected vocals and influence-recycling barely escape
    being lampoonable as striving to embody Clap Y'alls Hands Say Yeehaw.</p><p>
    At the risk of seconding the provincialism of Pace picante sauce
    commercials, the group does contain one actual Southerner, the manically
    talented drummer David Rogers-Berry, who is from my home state, the often
    (justifiably) maligned South Carolina. (The Mountain Goats' John Darnielle is
    fond of saying ""North, by god, Carolina,"" and Stephen Malkmus
    repeatedly used Charleston gigs as opportunities to mock ""South Carolina
    rock history."") But the Palmetto State has contributed respectably to
    ""cool"" culture lately, what with the rise of tunesmiths Band Of
    Horses and Iron &amp; Wine, as well as comedians Stephen Colbert and Aziz Ansari.
    Rogers-Berry's geography-cred isn't enough to save <em>Head Home</em>'s title
    from occasionally seeming as dishonest as fast food chain Hardees' ""come
    home"" (to a franchise?) campaign.</p><p>
    Too many of these songs seem so hurriedly basted in campy rascality that you
    might imagine the Cramps and Wes Craven staging a musical called <em>The
    Hillbillies Have Eyes</em>, or Gremlins having taken over the Grand Ole Opry,
    or, I don't know, <em>Little Shop Of Horrors</em> redone with a giant bilious
    honeysuckle. The hell-raising, fiddle-driven ""All The World"" rules
    supreme over the rest of the album's spooky material, and it tellingly arrives
    during the more settled second half. No one's demanding that hootenannies be
    pokerfaced, but when o'death reins in the mugging, they can resonate as powerfully
    as recent outsourced-Southernness acts such as Portland's Horse Feathers,
    Seattle's the Lights, Brooklyn's the Boggs, and so forth. Maybe o'death's yowl
    is trying to tell Frank Black that his current down-home phase could use a
    pinch of Black Francis; ""Nimrod's Son"" is a staple of this band's
    reputedly awesome live show.

    The more genial tracks such as ""Travelin Man"", ""Jesus Look
    Down"", and ""Gas Can Row"" are lived-in and powerful enough to
    help the listener forgive the anachronisms, best symbolized by the coalminer
    photos on the band's MySpace page. It's not o'death's fault that the stunning
    existential spiritual ""O Death"" got used during the weak Mel
    Brooksian Klan-rally scene in <em>O Brother Where Art Thou</em>, or that they're
    basically re-enacting incidental music for a mode of reckoning that is mostly
    gone. (As a little girl, my milltown-bred mother used to tie junebugs to each
    of her fingers and marvel at them; now her late adulthood leisure-time is spent
    clutching a remote control during autopsy-porn on CBS.) O'death wear their
    throwback jerseys well when their lyrics aren't mired in Bible-belt Mad
    Libs, and their passion for what they're doing-- as well as their cathartic
    energy-- is undeniable. One would have to outright hate the paranormal not to
    grant the stringy final minute of ""Ground Stump"" its cold chills, or
    be a neat freak to resist the use of what sounds like kicked broken bottles as
    percussion on ""Rickety Fence Teeth.""

    Pity whoever has to write the ""file under:"" copy for the
    press release announcing Georgia Anne Muldrow's first album. Not only does it
    jump genres like hobos jump trains; it's not even always sure about what genre
    it wants to jump into, and so it drags fragments of other musical worlds with
    it everywhere it goes. The most hip-hop moments are cracked up by odd meters
    and halting beats that bleed over from the most free jazz moments, while tinges
    of electro, r&amp;b, soul, and modern laptop mayhem hang out on the edges of
    just about everything.</p><p>
    When you first hear Muldrow's voice on <em>Olesi</em>, she sounds like Nina Simone on a long, low, bellowing line. That vocal comes on ""New Orleans"", the album's wicked opener, a
    Hurricane Katrina song that never considers trying to be an anthem and instead
    goes right for the kick in the gut with clattering free jazz. This is down with
    early-1970s free soul and jazz and has a similar vibe to Archie Shepp's <em>Attica Blues</em> or Sonny Sharrock's
    ""Peanut""-- not to mention Pharaoh Sanders, with whom Muldrow's mother once sang.</p><p>
    No sooner does Muldrow embrace her inner Alice Coltrane,
    though, than she all but abandons it, leaving the style behind but taking the black spiritual/revolutionary spirit with her-- she's not wearing the pan-African
    colors on the album cover for nothing. One thing the rest of the album could
    use is some focus. ""Melanin"", the first taste we get of her beat-making and
    production skills, fades away before it even gets two minutes to
    develop, and 21 tracks in 47 minutes feels a bit like a jumble at times. Despite the hodgepodge, it's
    mostly interesting-- when she's off, she's not off by much, and when
    she's on, she's really on.
    </p>
<p>
    First, there's the matter of her beats. If you want straight
    four on the floor, go elsewhere, because these are thoughtfully constructed
    little fragments of rhythm full of unexpected pauses and extra half-beats.
    ""Frames"" is maybe as straightforward as her beats get, and even it stutters and
    lurches as though it's having trouble carrying the weight of Muldrow's
    many-tracked vocal. There are places where the listener might sympathize with
    that difficulty, like ""Radio WNK"", which essentially drowns in its own smudged
    brew of random synth and hazy vocals.
    </p>
<p>
    When she pulls back and lets things really breathe, the
    results are astounding, as on ""Patience"", an unevenly flowing pool of sound
    that leaves the beat behind completely, allowing Muldrow to basically duet with
    a bassline. Her vocals run ""Feet"" like a relay race, each line handing off to
    a different track, solo delivery answered by big clouds of voices that speak of
    ""teaching the young ones how to organize.""
    </p>
<p>
    Muldrow has all the ingredients of a major statement laid
    out on the counter here, but she seems to be probing for the recipe that
    will put them together correctly. Still, she's in her early twenties and has
    truly scary talent-- I can see her being asked to produce other people as much as
    I can see her producing her own records. <em>Olesi </em>is ambitious and impressive in places, and I'm definitely
    eager to hear what she does next. For the moment, this album shows vision but
    doesn't quite fulfill it.

    It's become a critical reflex to auto-pan records of new material released by classic rock legends, a seemingly coordinated effort by the music-scribe community to create a unified message of ""shut up and play the old stuff!""  It's usually a justifiable knee-jerk: So many acts reunite with dollar signs in their eyes and a diluted pool of talent that the few artists who do make relevant albums in old age-- your Neil Youngs, your Tom Waitseses-- are miraculous by comparison.  Furthermore, there's something depressing about watching formerly popular bands persevere long past their prime, usually lacking some critical piece of their identity, be it simply youth, hunger, or the drive and courage to create something different.</p><p>
    The Who are more prone to these allegations than most, having famously decried the horrors of being old from their very beginning.  Now 20 years past the release of a record called <em>Who's Last</em>, and four years after the 2002 death of bassist John Entwistle, the band's continued existence seems feeble on paper.  Retaining the group's two most visible personalities, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey, is enough for the Who to remain a viable touring act for as long as they please, but anything new to come out of the group can't help but be predictable and hollow by this point, right?</p><p>
    Well, would it surprise you if that wasn't entirely the case with <em>Endless Wire</em>?  Obviously the rating up there isn't gaudy, but it certainly could be far worse for a band that arguably hasn't produced worthwhile new material since the Carter administration.  The first half of the record is everything one fears from a museum-piece band an entire generation past its prime: rehashes of old hits, preachy, creaky acoustic numbers, the noticeable absence of deceased contributors.  The second half, on the other hand, throws a bit of a curveball for a band expected to be robotically strip-mining the past, debuting a portion of a new Pete Townshend rock opera that provides fleeting glimpses of the Who sounding remarkably true to their younger selves.
    </p>
<p>
    About that first half: It says it all that the lead track and single (if there really is a radio station out there that would play a <em>new</em> Who song), ""Fragments"", is full of the same synthesizer arpeggios that grace the recently fashionable ""Baba O'Riley"".  That the song was produced by the ""Method"" from the aborted <em>Lifehouse</em> project (scraps of which became <em>Who's Next</em>) is the kind of trivia that will make the song excusable only to Who fanatics, while casual fans hear a knockoff with about 1% of the original's massive chorus.  Elsewhere, the first half veers between acoustic naps inspired by <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> (seriously) and forced upbeat numbers (the commercial commentary ""Mike Post Theme"", and the Fleetwood-Mac glossy ""It's Not Enough"") that sorely miss the rumble bass of ""The Ox"", not to mention Keith Moon's spectacular clatter.
    </p>
<p>
    Strangely, all the missing elements and nostalgia-grabs that make the first half of <em>Endless Wire</em> such a sad listen organize themselves into a form that is faintly exciting for the second part, which is comprised of songs from a rock-opera-in-progress called <em>Wire &amp; Glass</em>.  This shocking turn of events sorta makes sense; after all, it's vain for Townshend &amp; Daltrey at 60 to strive for their raucous early days, but the song-cycle heritage of <em>Tommy </em>and <em>Quadrophenia</em> remains within their now limited range.  
    </p>
<p>
    Focusing on a narrative, confusing as it might be, appears to give the band more purpose and to transmute its new weaknesses into old strengths. Daltrey's bellow, which sounds silly over the front half's thinner sound, works better in the service of dramatic material like ""Sound Round"" or ""Mirror Door"" (which, like the album cover, hearkens back to the imagery of <em>Tommy</em> more than a little bit).  In service to his story, Townshend gets more interesting with his arrangements, like the interwoven piano and guitar of ""Unholy Trinity"" or the much weirder reprise ""Fragments of Fragments"", segueing together mini-songs like a calmer, wiser ""A Quick One"".  
    </p>
<p>
    Is all that enough to save <em>Endless Wire</em>?  Again, based on the score, obviously not.  But it is a rare, unexpected move from a Hall of Fame band, creditable for being more than the usual Give The People What They Want pension scheme.  In most instances, the best case scenario for a reunion album is to justify its existence, to appear as more than just a pointless exercise in career perpetuation.  For the second half of <em>Endless Wire</em>, the Who at least meet those qualifications, producing work that adds, if incrementally, to their career body of work rather than just damaging the reputation of their long-ago days.

    favorite albums for the first time. While
    there's something to be said for knock-you-on-your-ass sonics and bewildering
    originality, the albums that resonate the most are often the ones that find a
    way to work themselves seamlessly into the routines and rituals of daily life. In the three years since the release of the
    Exploding Hearts' <em>Guitar Romantic</em>,
    there have been very few days that I haven't felt tremendously grateful that I
    can have my morning coffee with the opening chords of ""Modern Kicks"".<span> </span>To accuse the Hearts of relying upon clichés
    would be missing the point entirely-- the instantaneous familiarity of the
    band's music gives it ample room to develop and multiply as a kind of emotional
    prosthesis.</p><p>
    Speaking strictly in terms of influences and aesthetics, the
    Hearts aren't all that remarkable. There's
    certainly no shortage of bands that have touched on the work of Nick
    Lowe, the Buzzcocks, and the Undertones.<span>
</span>But the Hearts found a way not just to interpret and relate the music
    they love, but also to express that love in their own work. In many ways, the Exploding Hearts embody an immeasurably
    valuable and increasingly frowned-upon way of relating to music; <em>Guitar Romantic </em>strikes me not just as a
    great album, but as a reminder of why we need great albums in our lives.</p><p>
    That the Exploding Hearts need to be written about in past
    tense is beyond painful; only months after the release of their debut album,
    singer Adam ""Baby"" Cox, bassist Matt ""Lock"" Fitzgerald, and drummer Jeremy ""Kid
    Killer"" Gage died in a car crash on their way from San
    Francisco to Portland.
    <em>Shattered</em>
    collects all of the band's non-album material, including a handful of singles,
    unreleased tracks, and alternate mixes culled from the German vinyl release of <em>Guitar Romantic</em>.<span> </span>It's a complete, well-done and respectful
    package, and makes the entirety of the band's remaining material available
    cheaply and easily.
    </p><p>
    The singles on <em>Shattered</em>
    show the Hearts at their most straightforwardly power-pop-- ""Busy Signals"" and
    ""Shattered (You Left Me)"" would be right at home on a Teenline
    compilation.<span> </span>""(Making) Teenage Faces"" is
    as dumb lyrically as it is smart musically, starting with a nasally schoolyard
    chant and ending with a drum fill that directly quotes ""Radio Radio"". It's a completely representative intersection
    of shameless musical nerddom and punk rock posturing, and one of the most infectious
    songs the band has ever recorded.
    </p>
<p>
    Alternate versions of ""Modern Kicks"", ""Throwaway Style"", ""Thorns
    In Roses"", ""Still Crazy"", ""I'm a Pretender"", and ""Black and Blue"" are generally
    muddier and less focused than their album counterparts. No, this collection is not as strong as <em>Guitar Romantic</em>. And yes, the pleasure it evokes is largely
    the pleasure of hearing more music-- any music-- from one of your favorite
    bands. But it's a kind of pleasure that the
    Hearts earned-- not because of the band's tragic end, but rather because their
    music exudes a willingness to become an inextricable and irreplaceable part of your
    life.

    Damien Jurado's records are like little outposts on a desolate Midwestern highway: overgrown filling stations, dilapidated barns, canted trailers. They have that abandoned and futile quality; rustic and battered by time, they can make us gasp with nostalgia for lives we've never lived. In Jurado's songs-- tunes for falling asleep behind the wheel with a bottle between your thighs and nothing but sky on the horizon-- you can feel his accumulated fatigue.</p><p>
    But if you'd spent your entire musical career trawling the same highway, always stuck between gears, you'd be tired, too. ""Lover, I am still here breaking chairs,"" he sings on ""Hoquiam"", wallowing, as ever, in romantic stagnancy. Jurado's never quite in love and never quite out; he's always desperate, losing, and not too proud to beg. He's spent the better part of a decade falling for variously unavailable women-- wives, teen runaways, and people who've just moved on. It wouldn't be a Damien Jurado album if there wasn't a sense of endless return: <em>And</em> <em>Now That I'm in Your Shadow</em> finds him wearing his rut a little deeper into the road. ""Does your husband know I call you sweetheart?"" he asks on ""What Were the Chances"", going so far as to ask, ""Would you change your last name to mine?"" Jurado is joined by a new band on this album-- Eric Fisher and Jenna Conrad-- and it's Conrad, whose voice is as lovely and self-effacing as Jurado's, who answers him amid an icy, slow-mo swirl of acoustic guitar, clicky mechanical drums, and forlorn keys: ""I think my kids would mind."" Has this guy ever gotten a break?</p><p>
    If so, he hasn't put it down in song, and his latest album's aura of defeat makes you wonder if it's really starting to get to him. While Jurado's records often alternate between vanishing ballads and melancholy pop-rockers, <em>Shadow</em> revolves entirely around the former-- the songs are unstintingly slow, delicate, and sparse to the brink of abstraction. Jurado and his band festoon wide blank spaces with little scraps of finger-picked guitar, humming keys, and swelling strings, all seeming immersed within a great silence. As such, the album requires several listens before it resolves into something deeper than a pleasant background. 
    </p>
<p>
    Once you can hear them, the details are often captivating-- how ""Denton, TX"" brightens from a dim dirge to a sparkly shuffle with a flicker of piano, the dramatic efficacy of the title track's stormy cymbal washes, and the lean ripple that ""There Goes Your Man"" achieves despite its meager palette. Jurado can be a subtle lyricist-- the Decemberists-esque tragic love story ""I Had No Intentions"" is particularly well-turned-- but he ventures into romance novel territory too, with all of the sappy sentimentality (see pictures of babies and wedding days on ""I am Still Here"") and no redeeming penetration of moist grottoes. This penchant for cliché isn't the scope of who he is (this is a guy who wrote a really pretty song about asking God to kill his schizophrenic brother), but it's an undeniable part of him. At least, unlike so many other sad-sack singers, Jurado's weary resignation undersells the overstated lyrics-- he sounds like he's genuinely too sad to get worked up about them.

    Say one evening you decide that-- artistic growth and innovation be damned--
    you'll put on Liars' <em>They Threw Us All In a Trench and Stuck a Monument on
    Top</em>, just because you need a brief blast of crunching hysteria. You listen
    to the first side, flip it over, listen to the second, and let the needle sink
    into the lock groove at the end for a while as you continue folding clothes or
    huffing glue or whatever you do while listening to records. Suddenly, the
    needle slides across the vinyl with a screech and your turntable starts to spit
    blood. Your speakers let out a factory-precise churning noise, and the
    righteous bark of Angus Andrew is replaced with an overwhelmed wail that sounds
    a little like Peter Lorre limping away from a more threatening villain.</p><p>
    This is the sound of n0 things. Or rather, this <em>was</em> n0 things--
    singer/guitarist Christian Dautresme has already left the band, while bassist
    Pat Noecker has moved on to These Are Powers. But the former rhythm section of
    Liars-- Noecker and drummer Ron Albertson departed the band in 2002-- drive
    these propulsive, jagged, and unabashedly ugly tracks. Liars went on to push
    boundaries in their own right, but they're an exception to whatever indie-rock
    constitutes these days, increasingly generalized by its more popular polite and
    sunny progenies. n0 things aren't quite saviors for those missing a little
    filth, but the sound and atmosphere they mine on <em>Trees</em> satisfies.</p><p>
    Dautresme doesn't have the presence of Angus Andrew or the guitar invention
    of Aaron Hemphill. Still, he steers the readymade singular rhythm section to a
    different space, wailing like he's either trying to keep up with or run away
    from the pulsing quasi-industrial rhythms. Really, it just underlines how
    Noecker and Albertson excel on this record, varying styles and meters
    effortlessly while never letting up the pace. Dautresme grinds along with
    ""Trees"" and squeezes out a few staccato notes over ""Have It Your
    Way"" in a nauseous near-reggae pattern, but they finally begin to
    complement each other on ""Treat Us Like Children"". Here the bass
    takes an unexpectedly melodic turn in the chorus and Dautresme takes the reigns,
    sounding comfortable among the chaos. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Electric Chair"" is another woozy march, with a liberally deployed
    sample of an indistinct grinding noise. It precedes ""Coward"", far and
    away the disc's best track, which has an addictively evil (or is that evilly addictive?)
    rhythm and mustache-twirling vocal from Dautresme. The song carries a sort of
    impish glee, maybe from the tap of the glass-bottle sounding percussion in the
    verses or from Dautresme's raving ""yah yah yah""s on the chorus over
    the howling high notes of his guitar. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""International Insurrection"" is a late-album surprise, with guitar
    that sparkles and reverberates over a patient dub rhythm rather than spitting
    and grinding. It's easy to forgive the trite sentiment of the lyrics here, but
    not so much on the suffocating suicide ruminations of ""Offa Bridge"",
    which quickly grows tedious. From there, the final tracks on the disc become no
    less oppressive, but they blur together and become indistinguishable. Were the
    band still together, <em>Trees</em> would be an album rife with potential, and n0
    things a band to watch; unfortunately, a lot of promise and a few great tracks
    is all we've got.

A relative unknown in non-France, Mehdi is a veteran of the Parisian music scene, having produced one of the most controversial singles in French music history (Ideal J's ""Hardcore"" was banned from radio and television in 1998 for its riotous politics), made beats for MC Solaar, Franco-fied a Ryuichi Sakamoto soundtrack, and collaborated with Etienne De Crécy, Cassius, and Daft Punk. It was through his work with Daft Punk that Mehdi met their manager, Pedro Winter, who now heads the ultra-hip Ed Banger Records, a label hyped-to-life via its scumbag electro posterboys, Justice, and fishy gangster rap teen queen, Uffie. So, as the first full-length release from Ed Banger, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Lucky Boy </span>serves a dual purpose: It instantly stabilizes a catalog built on shaky trends, and it provides the ideal get-up complement to the rest of the label's all-out party artists. Incidentally, it's pretty good on its own, as well.
    <div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"">Mehdi calls this his ""future breakdance album"", and while that may be apt, nobody breakdances anymore. In reality, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Lucky Boy </span>is a ""getting ready"" album, if there ever was one. It's just long enough to get yourself clean and dressed, have a drink, and bust a preliminary move or two, but it never really breaks into a full dance album. Perfect evidence of this is ""I Am Somebody"" featuring Quebecois funk dudes Chromeo. Its wobbly bassline and major-key synth rushes are the sonic equivalent of waiting at the velvet rope, and Dave 1's lyrics capture the exact moment when being refused from an old spot spurs the creation of a new spot, repeating the titular phrase as if he's rallying the rejects. It is, at once, the pinnacle of Chromeo's existence and the highest point of the album. ""Always Be an Angel"", with its dizzying twirl of piano keys, horn stabs, and choir from the Fifth Dimension is almost as high, and the romping steel-guitar stunner, ""Lucky Boy"" featuring the breathy Fafi, has the good time trip-hop never could. But again, even the most manic moments feel like a preparation for something yet to be determined. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Lucky Boy </span>makes some calls and drives us around Paris looking for the ultimate party, never to find it, and that is both the album's strength and weakness. </span>
</div>
<div>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"">
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"">Judged against similar hip-hop-influenced instrumentalists like Rjd2 or Eliot Lipp, DJ Mehdi is superior. His ideas are better developed, and he understands that the term ""cinematic"" can mean more than moody set design. Maybe this is because he actually composed the score for Romain Gavras' <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Megalopolis</span>; maybe he's just a better songwriter. Regardless, the album tells a good story, even if it seems to stop after the first act. But that's also where it falters. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Lucky Boy </span>is not a fully realized narrative, and, after multiple listens, you may find that it's neither compelling enough as a collection of great songs or as a full album experience. If this happens, Mehdi should still find a place in your ""background music"" collection because the quality and complexity of his production will keep you interested but not distracted. His pre-club electro beats and glossy synth-funk are ideal for that sort of non-dancing dancing that you do while you're doing something else, which may be the intent since Mehdi's website shows him lounging around just the kind of airy Paris loft that you might wish you were in when you listen to this album.</span>

    on the opening line of her single ""Random"", lots of people knew exactly what J-Kwon looked like and thought he was
    going to be the next Nelly. For those diehards who've
    followed the fearless Brit's career from her pre-Def Jam days-- reading about
    her half-amusing, half-disastrous NYC debut and the impromptu audition for
    Jay-Z along the way-- <em>Public Warning!</em> can only be a letdown. Rumored
    collaborations with the Neptunes and Timbaland are nowhere to be found. And
    only a few tracks can truly be described as ""new,"" as most have been
    floating around the net for months or, in some cases, years. (Pitchfork alone
    has already <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/37451""><u>reviewed</u></a> <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/37155""><u>seven</u></a> <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/31149""><u>of</u></a> <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/30826""><u>the</u></a> <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/36466""><u>album's</u></a> <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/30505""><u>13</u></a> <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/30338""><u>tracks</u></a>.) More bad news: Most of the fresher material pales in
    comparison to rambunctious early singles like ""Ch-Ching"" (which is oddly absent). The too-long journey toward this
    debut LP is an interesting case study for slow-moving conglomerates in the face
    of the Hype Machine revolution, where an artist is only as good its last leaked
    track... that was probably downloaded, barely listened to, and consequently deemed
    ""ok"" nonetheless.</p><p>
    In many ways, Sov's trajectory seems similar to M.I.A.'s, as
    both are fawned-over Brit hip-hop-rooted acts who sealed major label support through internet fandom. But there's a big difference: M.I.A.'s record tanked; <em>Public
    Warning!</em> seems set to make a mark beyond the web. The Tetris-inspired video for its current
    single, ""Love Me or Hate Me"", hit No. 1 on TRL recently and the song is currently
    just eight spots behind Jay-Z's comeback track on the Billboard Hot 100.
    By appealing to the same iTunes-hungry teens that are making the <em>High School Musical
    </em>soundtrack the year's top-selling album, Def Jam has happened upon a counter-marketing
    sweet spot; as divas like Fergie, Christina, and Beyoncé stalk MTV with
    their perfectly plucked eyebrows and runway-ready attire, Sov is the tomboy in
    the bleachers taking the piss out of the whole lot.</p><p>
    And while it's exciting to think eighth graders might put <em>Public Warning! </em>on their Christmas lists, it doesn't necessarily
    take away its disappointing sting. Sure, ""Random"" still sounds great,
    it's blippy quipping coming off futuristic well after the grime bubble that
    birthed it burst. ""9 to 5"", with its ska-riffic horn bounce, is
    another oldie but goodie on which Sov predicts her own delayed impact: ""I'm
    no early birdie/ I'm lazy that's all I can say."" Of the newbies,
    ""Love Me or Hate Me"" is a canny breakout track in the tradition of
    Eminem's ""My Name Is"" that packs Sov's entire anti-priss, beer'n'belches worldview into three-and-a-half minutes. ""Those Were the
    Days"", meanwhile, is a winning moment of sincere nostalgia. Her flow
    sounding smooth over a DJ Premier-style golden-age beat, the 20-year-old nails the details
    of her carefree youth, reminiscing about when ""we played
    the first Mortal Kombat on the Sega"". The track's laid-back hook and pangs
    of sadness make it unique amidst the album's mostly blaring fare.
    </p><p>
    Taken in small doses, Sov is endearing and even energizing.
    But across almost 50 minutes, her hyperactive poses grow mighty tiresome. Her annoying streak is highlighted on several horrendously misguided rap-rock
    attempts that smear ghastly processed guitars over punk-hop backbeats. The title track suffers from a
    grating one-note shout-hook, and its bmp-busting drums seem to be vying for a spot on a seizure inducing
    Japanese video game soundtrack. The upbeat
    ""Hoodie"" mixes sweatshirt product placement with a cheeseball
    kiddie-chorus that wouldn't sound out of place in a Payless commercial (""Fling
    on an Adidas hoodie and just boogie woogie with me/ Or you can just put on your
    dancing shoes and get loose""). The Basement Jaxx-produced ""Blah
    Blah"" is too fast and frenetic to stick, while the stereotype-busting ""My
    England"" plods on infinitely, seemingly holding the rapper back with its
    slow tempo. Though Missy Elliott tacks a quick verse onto the ""Love
    Me or Hate Me"" remix, the lack of additional guests is a mistake
    that seriously hurts the album's replay factor. 
    </p>
<p>
    For every moment that Sov's
    supreme wit and impeccable cadence is fitfully showcased on<em> Public Warning!</em>,
    there is a moment when her gifts are squandered amidst anxious beats that try
    to compete with her huge personality. Further sullying the affair is the inescapable
    feeling that, somewhere between the early word-of-mouth success and the TRL
    reign, her midget-rebel guise picked up airs of big-machine commodification-- a hunch
    solidified by recent deals with Verizon and Swatch. With her visibility rising, it's a shame that Sov's finally making a dent on the
    heels of her most inconsistent offering to date.

    Last month, I conducted an e-mail interview with Squarepusher's
    Tom Jenkinson for another magazine. I sent him roughly 20 questions, and he
    responded with a small novella's worth of answers. Among them were his
    labyrinthine meditations on musicianship, materialism, situationism, and the
    work of ""anti-psychiatrist"" R.D. Laing, all of it eventually somehow tying back
    to <em>Hello Everything</em>, his 11th studio album. Ultimately, though, the biggest revelation to
    be had from his sprawling, 14-page reply wasn't that the usually tight-lipped Jenkinson
    secretly fancied himself IDM's Jesse Jackson, but rather the presence of words printed near the top of the page: <em>Pet Sounds</em>.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Yup--
    turns out not even your garden variety, <em>musique concrète</em>-listening, borderline
    reclusive, six-string bass virtuoso-cum-electronic godhead is impervious to the Beach Boys'
    charms. In the interview, Jenkinson even goes so far as to quote the album's
    liner notes-- specifically, the bit about Brian Wilson wanting to make melodies
    that made the listener feel loved. While that sentiment, believe
    it or not, is a recurring part of his mandate here, <em>Hello Everything</em> is still light years away from pop music-- and
    millions of light years away from the commercial realm. It is, instead, a deep
    breath of a record, one on which Jenkinson isn't preoccupied with pulling new contorted
    shapes in order to maintain his discography's twisting trajectory, but rather
    with finding comfort in familiar genre exercises, simplicity, and melody. In
    other words: It's uncharacteristically cordial.</p><p>
    It is also, in a weird and roundabout way, kind of a
    parallel universe <em>Best of</em>. Whether in
    the analog sounds of plinky opener ""Hello Meow"" (which might have been cribbed
    from <em>Go Plastic</em>), the hyperattenuated,
    pitched-up breakbeat of ""The Modern Bass Guitar"" (<em>Big Loada</em>), or the spacious, unfurling percussions and classical
    guitars of ""Circlewave 2"" (<em>Ultravisitor</em>),
    nearly every single thing here feels descended from some previous Squarepusher
    record. Normally, we scowl when records feel like patchwork collections of
    previous ideas, but in the context of an artist who's pretty much made a
    different kind of record every year for the past decade, <em>Hello Everything</em> offers a welcome cooldown period, an opportunity
    to revisit all those previous song forms and see how they work in conjunction
    with tighter, friendlier melodies.</p><p>
<span></span>Not surprisingly, some of the album's most memorable tracks are
    the ones that allow Jenkinson to flex his breakcore muscle; of
    those, the six-minute drill'n'bloop workout ""Planetarium"" is easily the highlight.
    Elsewhere, he runs rampant. On ""Bubble Life"", he hones the sprawling electro
    jazzfunk workouts so maligned on the underrated <em>Ultravisitor</em> into something more concise and pop-feeling; the eerie
    drone piece ""Vacuum
    Garden"" consists entirely
    of variously pitched sine waves; and the eleven-minute long closer ""Orient
    Orange"" marries clattering percussion sounds with yawning synths. The sheer size
    of <em>Hello Everything's</em> scope dictates
    it's a bit of a sprawling beast, more a collection of moments than a cohesive
    record. Nonetheless, it's a consistently enthralling listen, and proof that even
    when he tries to sit still, Jenkinson is never short on inspiration. <br/>

    Thunderbirds Are Now! are probably still floored by their own
    overachievement on 2005 sleeper album <em>Justamoustache</em>. All the
    elements TAN! bungled on previous releases-- the stop-start rhythms, new
    wave synth hooks, Les Savy Fav lite riffs-- crystallized on the band's
    sophomore album, creating the perfect storm of colorful, cartoonish
    post-punk and serving up a helping of crow to the many critics who
    thought sloppy debut <em>Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief</em> rang like a death knell for the group's career.</p><p>
    Friendly
    vindication enjoyed, TAN!'s third album, <em>Make History,</em> finds the band resting too
    comfortably on its laurels, or perhaps just flat-out unsure of a
    following act. In any event, it lacks the visceral intensity that made <em>Justamoustache</em>
    such an appealing bandwagon to jump on. That said, they haven't exactly
    backslid into the post-punk malfeasance of their early years. In fact,
    if anything, <em>Make History</em> presents TAN! at their most
    disciplined, more willing to play by conventional rock rules than ever.
    Take opener ""Panthers in Crime"", which deliberates on psychedelic
    acoustic guitar plucking for over a minute, gorging the track's
    grandeur to classic rock album opener standards. Sure, the hooks don't
    exactly come rapid-fire anymore, exploding like napalm on impact, but
    they're still there.</p><p>
    Then there's lead singer Ryan Allen; dude
    sounded like a lady on previous releases, but here he keeps the
    hyperventilation shrieks to a minimum. Not only does Allen now breathe
    between lyrics, his vocals sound their huskiest to date. ""We Win (Ha
    Ha)"" jerks over a similar rhythm to ""198090 (Aquatic Cupid's)"", though
    Allen nosedives from that song's vocal stratosphere, uttering the
    chorus line ""We've heard this one before"" with ennui.
    Similarly, Allen's guitar and Scott Allen's normally blistering synth
    lines feel restrained. Ryan's riffing opts for heartier power-chord
    progressions over the prickly, calculated snipes he took before, and
    Scott seems relegated almost exclusively to beefing up texture and
    atmosphere. Although he flaunts some searing synth on ""Why We War"",
    it's only a nod to previous works like ""Eat This City"" or ""198090""
    where keyboards galvanized the entire song.
    </p><p>
    The new meat and
    potatoes approach, love it or lump it, does yield some pleasant
    surprises on occasion. ""The Veil Comes Down"" sounds like Foo Fighters
    in a perfect world, not to mention a chorus that smacks of Nirvana's
    angular power-chord pop. ""Shake Them Awake"" is wound as tight as any
    previous material, hot enough to burn out under the two-and-a-half
    minute mark. Unfortunately, though, these breakneck flashes are just that
    here-- flashes. Call it sadistic, but like early Trail of Dead, TAN!
    moves and shakes best when the band itself teeters on the edge of
    self-destructing. Slowed down and pored over on <em>Make History</em>, TAN! still boasts nifty hooks and ideas, it's just a little too easy to chew.

    Even when he was a theory-oriented and Mills College-trained electronic
    minimalist making glitchy records for labels like 12k and Fällt, San
    Francisco-based artist Christopher Willits had a pop streak. Records like<em>
    Folding &amp; the Tea </em>and <em>Pollen</em> were created with a software system
    he constructed that processed his guitar according to certain random patterns,
    allowing him to improvise along with a systems-assisted version of himself as a
    duet. It was music as heady and abstract as anything by Markus Popp or Terre
    Thaemlitz, but it was unfailingly warm, organic, often even tuneful, reminding
    me of what Microstoria might sound like as a pop band.</p><p>
    So it wasn't a complete surprise when Willits released ""Colors
    Shifting"" on the Ghostly International compilation <em>Idol Tryouts
    Two</em>. ""Colors"" showcased his clicky guitar stutters in the context of a
    shoegazy pop song, complete with vocals. <em>Surf Boundaries </em>includes that song and builds from the same essential idea, using as a
    foundation the processed guitar music he's been making for several years and
    adding a dollop of lush, dreamy pop. Willits' voice is heard alongside
    that of Latrice Barnett, and the male/female duet deepens the connection to the
    classic shoegaze aesthetic. They aim for the round, soft, and asexual sound of
    M83, preferring gentle spaciness to excursions into more unsettling noise. It's
    a hopeful sound, more sunlight than clouds.</p><p>
<em>Surf Boundaries </em>is a winner in terms of sonics-- especially if you're
    driven toward Willits' pseudo-CD-skipping experiments and gauzy drones. His chopping of held tones into confetti-sized
    fragments adds an air of uncertainty, removing the steady, reassuring beam trained
    on the horizon. And Willits nicely integrates horns, creamy synths, and more
    conventional guitar noises, getting the mix just right, so that the voices can
    ride in like another instrument. 
    </p>
<p>
    The problem, as so often becomes an issue
    when experimental musicians go pop, is songs. Or lack thereof. About half of these
    tracks have vocals, but none can really be called a ""song,"" at least
    in the sense of a melody and chords that seem to have a life of their own. The
    tunes generally stick to evenly spaced quarter notes moving between the same
    handful of pitches. This in and of itself doesn't have to be an issue for dream
    pop, when the vocals are buried in the mix and used as an accent. Even here on
    ""Orange Lit Spaces"", where Willits integrates his guitar cut-ups with
    similar processing on Barnett's voice, the effect is powerful. And the stretch
    between there and the effervescent drone of ""Finding Ground"", on to
    the hissy, mic-inside-the-amp ambience of ""Saturn"", is the best run of
    music on the album. 
    </p>
<p>
    But then comes ""Green and Gold"", letting the air out of the
    balloon. That such a flabby tune, without the melodic backbone to stand
    upright, serves as a thematic touchstone of the record-- cropping up in
    slightly different forms on ""Colors Shifting"", ""Medium
    Blue"", and ""Yellow Spring""-- is dispiriting. And these tracks,
    unlike ""Orange Lit Spaces"", want very much to be heard and accepted
    as songs, but they don't come across. The experimental-into-pop arc is one to
    be encouraged, still, and I'd love to see Willits work in this arena again. But
    <em>Surf Boundaries </em>stands as a sporadically compelling near miss.

    All around the world, mannish bar rock is stretching its legs and purring
    contentedly. Among its key participants, the National transform Jack and Cokes
    into rich, detailed closing-time ""heartcore,"" Australian trio the
    Devastations traffic in humid sex and mayhem with a Nick Cave pompadour, and
    sexy senior Greg Dulli has trained his Twilight Singers to sweat piss, bristle
    infectious machismo, and snort darkly urbane chorus bumps. Sporting an
    appropriately male-specific name, the Favourite Sons are Brooklyners easily
    linked to the cartel.</p><p>
    Favourite Sons' Irish-born vocalist Ken Griffin fronted mid-90s J.D.
    Salinger-quoting art rockers Rollerskate Skinny, who issued at least one
    classic album in 1996's <em>Horsedrawn Wishes</em>. After Rollerskate Skinny
    disbanded, he relocated to NYC, formed the short-lived Kid Silver, released <em>Dead City Sunbeams</em> in 1999, and
    then took a job tending bar. Members of the ex-Philadelphia band Aspera, who'd
    recently moved to the Big Apple minus their singer, spotted him at work in
    2004. Anyone who's watched ""Behind the Music"" can see where this
    goes: They joined forces, pulled glory from pain, and after a GSL 7-inch and an
    EP on UK-based Loog Records, they've released their full-length debut, <em>Down
    Beside Your Beauty</em>.</p><p>
    Structurally, the capably tame sounds have a certain a Silver Jews amble.
    And while the choruses are catchy enough, the playing is rote. As those familiar
    with his past projects will attest, Griffin has a great, bourbon-rich voice;
    with age, it's accrued even more Iggy deeps and Ferry trills. Occasionally he
    saves a song, carrying it to shore on his quavers, as when he dictates a
    baroque caterwaul on ""Down Beside You Beauty"" or hoots and howls on
    the side-winding, sorta punkish opening to ""Rise Up"". Whenever
    Griffin works himself up to these escalations, the stuff's pleasing, but he
    doesn't cut loose often enough. 
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe we can blame the production. The chorus of the above-mentioned
    ""Rise Up"" is a pancake flatline when it needs to be all sweaty and
    aching with oomph. Often, though, the vocals and the instruments don't really
    mesh and it sounds like he's singing over a karaoke backdrop. The misfired recording
    is confounding, since it was overseen and massaged by Victor Van Vugt, who's
    responsible for work by PJ Harvey, Nick Cave, Billy Bragg, the Pogues, and the
    Fall, among others. 
    </p>
<p>
    Word-wise, the album starts out with it's best image: ""Dead bodies piling
    up like garbage in the sun/ It makes me feel so strong, because the mountain
    came to me and my baby."" The song that houses the words is some classy
    Roxy Music rock. ""The Tall Grass"" has a rousing, romantic chorus--
    ""And If I can, I'll kill a million birds for you/ And if I die in the tall
    grass dreaming, I hope I'm dreaming of you/ And if I die in the tall grass
    bleeding, I hope I'm bleeding for you""-- that lathers into a rather
    gorgeously Bono-fied ending: ""Your beauty calls for silence."" Sweet.
    The plodding ""Beautiful Smile"" includes a tiny dagger: ""It
    makes me want to tear the room apart/ When I think of you dying."" And
    Griffin does an excellent job when he flexes on the title track: ""You're
    my woman, don't you ever call me out.""  
    </p>
<p>
    As has been mentioned in various Favourite Sons stories, designer and
    Project Runway judge Cynthia Rowley soundtracked her Fashion Week showcase with
    their tunes. Not much of a fashionista, I looked at her designs and took an
    informal straw poll to see what's what. Okay, I'm no clothes horse, and still
    think Will Oldham has the best style imaginable, but her wares seem like pretty
    basic duds: Not especially bland, but not especially <em>not</em> bland. Right?
    Black. Some flowers. Pretty. A few things with <em>almost</em> wacky cuts.
    Likewise, Favourite Sons are capable but dull-- <em>Down Beside Your Beauty</em>
    needs a bit more specificity and piles of dirty chutzpah (like garbage in the
    sun). As of now, the quintet come off enjoyably boring-- not ""favorite""
    sons, but pretty decent kids you don't mind visiting on holidays, if Greg Dulli
    and Matt Berninger aren't returning your calls.

With that contrast between push and pull in mind, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Altar</span>-- written and recorded
    largely before a joint tour last fall-- risks leaving an audience stranded in the middle by inertia.</p><p>
    Indeed, the second half of <em>Altar</em> does just that, leaving
    the audience adrift in left field with little direction or purpose.
    But, together, the first three tracks are a perfect capitulation of their conjoined aesthetics. 
    Opener ""Etna"" creeps in through feedback and slowly building and
    shifting bass tones before a huge guitar sweep-- split between Sunn
    0)))'s Greg Anderson and Boris' Takeshi-- takes charge a minute in. A
    veritable war of tones follows, Boris drummer Atsuo filling the
    low-lying space between the subterranean guitar arches with cymbal
    rolls. Six minutes later, the air forces-- piercing, upper-register,
    signature-Boris guitar attacks-- obliterate the lowly, warring
    miscreants, razing the drama and letting it slow burn into ""N.L.T.""</p><p>
    The follow-up-- featuring the bowed bass of Sunn 0)))
    collaborator Bill Herzog-- is a vibrantly bleak and texturally
    captivating work reminiscent of Daniel Menche. Atsuo-- the only other musician present-- splatters
    the canvas, lustrous edges shaped from the sound of bowed cymbals and a
    carefully managed gong. It's followed by <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Altar</span>’s
    centerpiece and masterpiece, ""The Sinking Belle (Blue Sheep)"". ""Belle"" is the one track on which its players conspire to subvert outside notions
    of both bands. Sunn 0)))'s glacial motion is intact, as is Boris' lucid use of
    almost-gentle tones. But the amplifiers are turned down, and distortion is all
    but lost. Instead, warm analog delay lets the sound drift in plumes, and beautiful,
    understated slide guitars and O'Malley's careful piano create a cradle for Jesse Sykes. Here, her
    voice shifts and floats like the retiring wafts of blue-gray smoke from a
    funeral pyre at a misty dawn. It’s an exhalation, a last breath of robust
    beauty.

    But, on the heels of such an overwhelming, unexpected
    triptych, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Altar </span><span>never recovers,
    essentially moving in redundant circles for 32 minutes. Three tracks either
    highlight the magic Sunn 0))) and Boris have crafted separately for a decade or
    the pitfalls that such work has avoided. The deftly fragmented chords that end ""The
    Sinking Belle"" open the door for the record's second side, but ""Akuma
    No Kuma"" is waylaid early by a harangued vocal take, an out-of-place horn
    fanfare, and overly involved Moog lines. Wata's eerie voice and the nebulous
    echo on everything in ""Fried Eagle Mind"" builds a paranoid sleep-state eclipsed
    after seven minutes by a solid sheet of guitar noise. It fades barely, slamming
    hard into ""Bloodswamp"", a 14-minute, multi-textural drone that would be an accomplishment

    Full disclosure: I haven't seen this movie yet. I'm planning
    on it, in a few days. While I can't yet speak to the movie's themes, or even its use
    of these songs, I do know that <em>Marie
    Antoinette</em>-- which has been anticipated with wrung hands ever since the first
    trailer hit YouTube, splicing New Order onto scenes of
    pre-Revolution Versailles splendor-- strolls a very fine line in even
    attempting to portray the interior life of a public figure who is still
    divisive more than 200 years after her death. So never mind that the
    film was booed at Cannes-- it was
    bound to upset someone. The period and the person remain hotbeds of debate,
    socially and politically. Those issues play out in the movie's soundtrack, a
    fascinating collection that rises above <em>Knight's
    Tale</em> stunt-scoring or <em>Jubilee</em>
    grave-robbing to comment directly on the title character herself. <em>Marie Antoinette</em> is a soundtrack as
    sovereign entity, married to the film but not dependent on it for meaning or
    listener enjoyment.</p><p>
    Say what you want about Sofia Coppola the filmmaker, but
    Coppola the soundtrack auteur is uniquely intuitive and confidently complex
    (this soundtrack, like those for her previous films, is produced by Brian
    Reitzell, although it seems completely her own). Going into this review and
    coming out of it, I'd place her above even Wes Anderson and Todd Haynes in her ability to illuminate emotion with music. For her, pop songs aren't just the aural
    equivalent of mood lighting, but active agents of characterization. In <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> and <em>Lost in Translation</em>, she used music as
    dialogue, expressing characters' deepest desires even when they didn't have the
    self-awareness to verbalize them. Think of the neighborhood boys playing LPs
    over the phone for the Lisbon
    girls in <em>The Virgin Suicides</em>, those anthems to personal freedom and adolescent abandon that only made
    them feel more doomed. Think of Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte singing ""Brass in Pocket""
    right to Bill Murray's Bob Harris in <em>Lost in Translation</em>, begging him to find her unique. Think of him answering
    her with ""More Than This"".
    </p><p>
    Similarly, the songs on <em>Marie
    Antoinette</em> speak just as strongly as dialogue-- and on a level that doesn't
    demand knowledge of the movie itself, just a general idea of the issues at play
    in a retelling of the party-girl queen. Coppola collects mostly postpunk and New Pop hits
    on the first disc, letting them bridle against each other. One of the main
    complaints about the postpunk revival in indie music has been that new bands
    seem to have little to no grasp of the extreme politics that created that
    music; to some extent modern musicians can't relate-- most have never had to
    struggle nearly as hard as their influences, and almost all of them participate
    in a system that allows them to get their music heard almost immediately by a
    wide audience. Coppola, however, sees the political possibilities in New Order, Bow Wow Wow, and Adam &amp; the Ants and she lets them
    fight out the politics of Marie Antoinette's era. With its austere guitars and
    anti-materialistic lyrics, Gang of Four's ""Natural's Not in It"" slyly, viciously
    undercuts the primitive decadence of Adam &amp; the Ants' ""Kings of the Wild Frontier"", as well as Bow Wow Wow's bourgeois odes to luxury ""Aphrodisiac"" and ""I Want Candy"", which unironically equate materialism with desire. The soundtrack is no polemic,
    however: Even at her fluffiest, Bow Wow Wow's Annabella Lwin track makes frizzy desire and madcap
    consumption sound attractive and inviting, as a lifestyle if not as a political
    statement.
    </p>
<p>
    In this heated context, the trust-fund rock of the Strokes'
    ""What Ever Happened"" sounds almost like a punchline (although Coppola gets
    extra credit for drawing from the underrated <em>Room on Fire</em>). Equally suspect are sugary petit fours like the
    Cure's pillow-mountain ""Plainsong"" and Windsor
    for the Derby's ""The Melody of a Fallen Tree"". Even the excerpt of Vivaldi's
    ""Concerto in G"", the only classical piece on the first disc, sounds apt in this
    setting, coyly mimicking the revving rhythms of the rock songs around it. Surprisingly,
    the Radio Dept. fall deftly between the two sides: ""Pulling Our Weight"" and ""I
    Don't Like It Like That"" sound lushly economical and positively anti-bourgeois,
    not wasting a single note or sound.
    </p>
<p>
    If the first disc is a mixtape debate, the second is a box
    of bonbons-- a more traditional soundtrack, similar to <em>Lost in Translation</em> in its mix of new and borrowed instrumentals
    with low-key pop songs. Two Aphex Twin pieces-- ""Jynweythek Ylow"" and ""Avril
    14th""-- balance synthetic sounds with organic moods, while Dustin O'Halloran's
    piano works mix languorously with subdued tracks by Squarepusher and Air. Only
    the Kevin Shields remix of Bow Wow Wow's grating take on ""Fools Rush In"" sounds out of place here-- it's
    better understood and marginally forgivable as the ultimate bourgeois luxury, a
    pointless cover of a chestnut that would be more fitting on the first disc. The
    exact opposite of ""Natural's Not in It"", the song is a mouthful of frosting:
    sweet and creamy but a little sickening. Then again, it's also the only break
    from Disc 2's supper-club pleasantness and passive mood-setting-- the old-hat
    soundtrack tact. I can't help but think that Coppola has given herself over to
    the attractiveness of luxury: Disc 2 is the very thing that Disc 1 warns
    against.
    </p>
<p>
    PART 2
    </p>
<p>
    I've just returned from the theater, where I was mildly
    disappointed in <em>Marie Antoinette</em>, but
    nevertheless oddly intrigued. A teen movie in period garb, the film struck a
    weird balance in its use of music and politics: There seemed too little of
    either, yet it was clear that any more would have overloaded the screen.
    ""Natural's Not in It"" plays over the opening credits, acknowledging the class
    issues involved in any retelling of Antoinette's story. And yet it sounds like
    a feint. Coppola keeps the postpunk music to a minimum, favoring the Disc 2
    instrumentals and the vocalless sections of songs by the Strokes, Windsor for
    the Darby, and Radio Dept. On the whole, these songs sound slightly
    disconnected from the scenes they score, and the punk/postpunk aesthetic feels oddly
    appended. There's the now-familiar type treatment for the title, mimicking the
    cover art for <em>Never Mind the Bollocks</em>,
    and there's a short montage featuring headlines scrawled across Antoinette's
    portrait, a visual allusion to the aesthetic of Derek Jarman's <em>Jubilee</em>. But what to make of these
    references? What do they add up to?
    </p>
<p>
    Likewise, what to make of Coppola's handling of class
    issues? She keeps the movie focused squarely, even claustrophobically, on the
    Queen, assessing her just as the aristocracy do, albeit less viciously. There
    are intimations of popular unrest and of the uprising to come, but the public
    is largely absent from this movie-- as far from Coppola's concerns as they are
    from Antoinette's. When we do see them, they are literally a faceless mob-- as
    inhuman to the director as they are to Antoinette. Like the Queen, Coppola doesn't
    seem to know what to do with them. She's backed herself into a corner: If she
    were to address the issue any more directly, it would fundamentally redefine
    the focus of the movie and inexorably cast Antoinette as a villain, ruining her
    careful and often affecting portrait.
    </p>
<p>
    So, looking over what I wrote before I saw <em>Marie Antoinette</em>, when I had just the
    music to consider, I'm tempted to say that I read too much into the soundtrack,
    that perhaps I gave Coppola too much credit based on her previous films. Then
    again, these songs-- chosen and sequenced with obvious care-- do for <em>Marie Antoinette</em> what the screenplay
    cannot: They talk out these issues in the background, at a remove from the
    action but in a way that is still very present and relevant. They allow Coppola
    to have her cake and eat it too.

    Of the many bands that do the suddenly pervasive Springsteen thing better
    than the Killers, Memphis' Lucero are perhaps the most surprising. Not because
    they lack the technical or emotional range, but because they've always seemed
    too Southern to convincingly evoke the Jersey shore. But Lucero get around, as
    their heavy tour schedule and all those songs about the road attest.</p><p>
    ""I Can Get Us Out of Here"", the fourth track on their fifth album, <em>Rebels, </em><em>Rogues</em><em> &amp; Sworn Brothers</em>, sounds like one of those throwaways
    from <em>The River</em> that was never a hit but is someone's favorite, like ""Jackson Cage"" or ""Sherry Darling"". Over Rick Steff's
    momentous piano chords, which drive the song just as much as Roy Berry's drums,
    Ben Nicholls' sings about a girl named Jenny getting drunk in a bar downtown:
    ""Long legs use 'em and run/ Blue eyes that blind like the sun/ I might not
    be the one/ But that's all right."" It's the promise of escape more than
    Steff's piano that draws the Boss comparison, suggesting that Lucero have honed
    and expanded their sound considerably over the years. With abrupt shifts in
    tempo and style and a foundation in rock lore, Lucero's brand of country rock
    remains unpretentious as ever. But the range and impact of <em>Rogues, Rebels</em>
    suggest the band has greater ambitions and the chops to realize them.</p><p>
    These songs reveal a looser Lucero, sporting not only a new collaborator in
    Steff, a veteran who also plays in Cat Power's band, but a few new tricks as
    well. Many of the same elements are in play: Berry's wily drumming, John
    Stubblefield's melodic low end, Nicholls' polarizing growl, and Brian Venable's
    earth-scoring guitar tone (did I really write that the band was better off
    without him?). Venable unleashes a flurry of descending notes on ""San
    Francisco"", and fires off muscle-car riffs on ""The Mountain"" and
    ""Sing Me No Hymns"" (the latter of which demands the noncritical description
    ""badass""). Berry's drums sound a little too low in the mix, but he
    still keeps the band agile, allowing them to change directions mid-song and
    build dramatically on the shoulda-been-the-closer ""On the Way Home"".
    In fact, <em>Rogues, Rebels</em> could have been the best showcase for the band's
    taut dynamic yet. 
    </p>
<p>
    Could have been. All those years on the road may have sharpened their
    musical attack and targeted their jams, but those same years appear to have
    narrowed Nicholls' songwriting, reinforcing some of his worst lyrical
    tendencies. Almost every song on <em>Rebels</em> touches on Nicholls'
    favorite subjects: drinking, bars, and girls. Those that don't could
    conceivably be set in a bar or addressed to an unmentioned woman. They're
    either vague and slightly pandering, like ""She's Just That Kind of
    Girl"", or specific and slightly pandering, like ""Cass"". The main
    character of the latter has ""more beauty than the setting sun.""
    Nicholls continues: ""She'd dance and flirt with all the boys/ But all her
    beauty she would sooner destroy."" The girl in the
    final song, ""She Wakes When She Sleeps"", has a similar relationship
    with her own good looks: ""She wears a sorrow her beauty can't hide,""
    he sings in his trademark growl. ""I pray she sheds it and sleeps the whole
    night."" 
    </p>
<p>
    The main problem, besides the relentless repetition of theme, is that these
    girls are so idealized they never seem real, which perhaps is Nicholls'
    underlying intention. The tough, transient lifestyle of a touring band has made
    it so he can't get out of his own head and can't write from any other
    perspective than onstage. The world is fixed, but Nicholls is constantly in
    motion. As a result, most women remain at a sad emotional distance, hanging out
    after the final encore until the band packs it up and moves to the next town.
    Lucero plays a killer show, but you wish Nicholls would give the band something
    new to work with.

    Just as the phrase suggests,
    rock'n'roll is a music of tension and contradictions, its 50-year history defined
    by a cyclical action/reaction relationship between prefab spectacle and ragged authenticity. So what to make of a band like the Horrors, who like it both ways?
    Looking like they just walked out of Tim Burton's costuming department, this
    week's <em>NME</em> poster children appear to be the sort of band that spends more money
    on wardrobe than recording budgets. And a little mascara (and backing from Ultragrrrl) goes a long way toward
    explaining how a fledgling garage-rock band with just a short EP to their name are
    already starring in Chris Cunningham-directed videos with Samantha Morton and getting produced by Nick Zinner instead
    of playing the Dirty Water Club for 50 miserable sods on a Tuesday night bill
    with the Country Teasers. Strip away their fanciful Edward Gorey get-ups and the Horrors may as well just be the Horrors-- i.e., the less celebrated, Iowa-based
    In the Red band of the same name (who I imagine will be contacting their lawyers
    any day now).</p><p>
    But even if the UK Horrors'
    debut five-song EP will hardly seem shocking to anyone who experienced the B-52s, the Cramps, or the Damned the first time around, when compared to typical Brit
    indie-tabloid fashionista fare, they're a refreshingly lewd and crude anomaly. For
    all their sartorial extravagance, the Horrors are studious garage-punk purists
    who like it raw to the bone: bastardized blues scales, corrosive peaked-level production,
    and, in the absence of the technical skill to pull off a guitar solo, just scrape
    the strings and/or lean on the organ.</p><p>
    Frontman Faris Badwan's
    hysterical sing-speak strikes the right balance of rigor and ridiculousness, yelping
    out campy character studies like ""Sheena Is a Parasite"" and ""Crawdaddy Simone"" over
    ""Rock Lobster"" rhythms tailor-made for go-go dancers with Bride of Frankenstein
    beehives. And even if the concept of British gore-hounds covering a song about Jack the
    Ripper feels just as tired as American industrial bands referencing Charles
    Manson, the last song here suggests the band have higher aspirations than simply
    giving us a more bad-ass seasonal alternative to ""The Monster Mash"": As the lone
    Horrors track that doesn't draw attention to its own horror-ness, ""Excellent
    Choice"" intensifies its manic momentum with dueling, dissonant vocal lines that
    sound menacing enough even without any serial-killer shout-outs.
    </p>
<p>
    And back to the grave we go after
    just five songs and 12 minutes-- which, according to British-press legend, also
    happens to be the average length of a Horrors concert. It's unclear whether the
    band's abrupt stage exits are part of a Jesus and Mary Chain-inspired deconstruction
    of performance conventions, or an implicit understanding that you don't really
    need to hear more than five songs of this stuff at any given time. Or maybe it's
    just the band's comment on its own predicted shelf life. But even if the
    Horrors' shtick already seems played out by Nov. 1, at least we have today. Release
    the brats.

Of all the things they teach you in school that have nothing to do with real life, it has the most to do with real life, governing pretty much, you know, <em>everything</em>. Music is not exempt. Artists like Excepter probe the abstract theoretical spaces where math's order falls apart. Others, such as Outputmessage, prefer to mine the elegant intersections where math pulls everything together. Outputmessage's Bernard Farley, a student of math, undoubtedly knows his way around chaos theory and fractals. But you'd never know it from the utopian <em>Nebulae</em>, a ruly grid of algebraic linearity.</p><p>
<em>Nebulae </em>tacitly posits a perfectible world where all relations and events can be reconciled, without spillover, in an inflexible and all-encompassing logic. In this regard it resembles a compressed, hookier Kraftwerk. Farley is adept at capturing subtle gradations of mood within a narrow range-- ""Snow"", for instance, is as placid and deliberate as its namesake-- but even the uptempo tracks are some permutation of remote, dreamy, and chill. On the scampering ""Sommeil"", a strobe-light synth flickers over loping drums and ice-chip tones, and the album spends much of its 30-odd minutes on just such convincing yet familiar intimations of futuristic splendor.</p><p>
    But for all his cool precision, Farley is clearly more interested in songs than sounds-- you can tell from his haymaker dynamic shifts and his hazy verse/chorus structures. He has a weird knack for making techno sound like Dismemberment Plan. ""Glintz"" has the formula nailed-- reverbed synth stabs, weightlessly galloping drums, a floating undercurrent of two alternating melodic tones (a Farley favorite), and a buzzing, rubbery bass countermelody. Even the rain of tiny chimes sounds mechanical; every rhythmic agent is clearly outlined and coasting on rails; no hiccups disrupt the unstinting thrust.
    </p><p>
    Farley's few stabs at the off-kilter make clear why he usually sticks to the seamless-- he's better at it. ""Approaching Skyline"" is the album's first sign of irregularity, with its damaged drum track and bleating bass blobs, although soon enough a spacey synth straightens out the crooked percussion like a back brace. Farley's compositions don't seem as exciting when they're plodding predictably, each shift telegraphed from a mile away. But on livelier tracks, this same predictability occasions rollercoaster-type qualities of anticipation and momentum. No one likes a roller coaster running at half speed. Happily, ""Nouvelle Forme"" gets things moving again with its sputtering synths and spring-wound drums, its vibrant collision of resonant and rimmy percussive tones. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Nebulae</em> is for the most part winning but defiantly unsubtle-- there's no search for anything, no struggle or slippage. It's another frictionless glide above another distant crystal city, sometimes breathtaking, always flawless and clinically removed, and, as such, tinged with a vague ennui.

    I was introduced to Animal Collective by this website.
    Andy Beta's June 2003 review of <em>Here Comes the Indian</em>, paired with a
    strong off-site recommendation from Dominque Leone, led me to believe that this
    band could be worth my while. It took some time to confirm. <em>Here Comes the
    Indian </em>didn't take immediately, but the deal was finally sealed in August
    of that year, during a surreal trip through the Virginia wilderness.</p><p>
    I was in rural Buckingham County, driving alone, an
    hour or so after nightfall, and it started to rain. Little sprinkles at first,
    and then a heavy downpour, punctuated by huge explosions of lightning that
    turned the dark woods into daylight. It was the kind of rain where you can only
    see about 20 feet in front of your car and you're constantly wondering if you
    should pull off to the side and wait it out. But the road was empty and
    straight, so I pressed on. While all this was going on, I was listening <em>Here
    Comes the Indian</em> at high volume. It wasn't pleasurable in the usual sense,
    but it was intense. The echoing vocals and rustling noise of ""Infant
    Dressing Table"", in particular, scared the living crap out of me--
    especially in my state of elevated stress. But it was also hugely exhilarating
    and, in its own way, beautiful. There was something to this band after all.</p><p>
    Since then I've gone backward in Animal Collective's
    catalog while simultaneously spending a lot of time with each new release. It's
    an uneven body of work, to be sure, but they're a terrifically fun band to
    follow closely. You're never quite sure what's going to come next, and their
    music tends to hold up to many plays remarkably well. Of the early pre-<em>Indian
    </em>stuff, the rare live album <em>Hollinndagain--</em> originally a vinyl-only
    issue limited to 300 copies--<em> </em>contains some of their strongest material.
    It captures the band in 2001, performing in the WFMU studios and in New
    York, Nashville, and Austin while touring with Black Dice. Animal Collective at
    this point was a noisy, neo-tribal band in the vein of their tourmates, using
    crude noisemakers, pedals, acoustic guitars, and drums to bash out their own
    version of abstract ritual music. But where Black Dice convey a vaguely
    menacing sense of nihilism, Animal Collective project something comparatively
    warmer and more delicate-- even when they're playing manic bursts of
    unpredictable clatter. 
    </p>
<p>
    Detractors hear in the five-minute mush that begins the
    opening ""I See You Pan"" three dudes (Deaken wasn't in the band at
    this point) randomly diddling with analog noisemakers, but Animal Collective
    understand as well as any band today the power of contrast. This shapeless
    opening is what gives the echoing vocal loops in the second half-- Panda Bear's
    fragile trapped-in-the-machine glitch-- their vibrant and faintly sad energy.
    This leads uninterrupted into ""Pride and Fight""; backing Panda Bear
    is just foot stomps and some chanting from Avey Tare, setting up the moment
    when the heavy downstrokes of the acoustic guitars and some tom-tom bashing push
    the song into a completely hypnotic realm. Geologist's gurgling synths,
    combined with the chanting and wailing vocals, owe much to the sun worship of
    Boredoms, another band that hears noise and chaos as a healing, rather than
    destructive force. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Forest Gospel"", which closes out what is
    essentially a single 17-minute song, is considerably more intense, with someone
    chanting and then screaming, ""You pull out the prick/ You pull out the
    stick,"" as Panda performs furiously sloppy drum rolls. It's difficult to say exactly what it means, but it seems like it's
    about someone hurting or being hurt, and normally such an aggressive musical
    expression leads me to wonder which side of a violent situation is being
    represented. But Animal Collective offer a third possibility-- that, like the Boredoms, their music treats noise and aggression
    in a more abstract manner, the volume existing as a celebratory end in itself rather than tied to anything specific and easily identifiable. 
    </p>
<p>
    The back half of the record-- four snippets recorded on
    tour-- is more free-floating and atmospheric, as voices are treated with delay
    and distortion and folded into a colorful soup of electronic sound. It's not
    nearly as engaging as the record's first half, save a few bits of ""Pumpkin
    Get a Snakebite"" where the band becomes a few clicks more unhinged, but it
    effectively creates a shifting, textured dark ambience that's even more compelling for being captured live in a room.
    </p>
    Taken
    as a whole, <em>Hollinndagain </em>is a convincing demonstration that Animal
    Collective were bursting with ideas and imagination even at an early stage. It's
    amazing to think of where they were at that point in 2003, when <em>Here Comes
    the Indian </em>and glowing acoustic drone <em>Campfire Songs</em> were hitting
    shelves, this live album and their first two studio records already
    circulating. Here was a band that could go anywhere. No one would guess they'd
    spend their next two full-lengths incorporting more conventional indie rock touchstones,
    which happened to be a sound they're also remarkably good at-- although it's hard not to
    wish that they might step back for a minute to this time, when the road first
    forked, and see if another trail might be cut.</div>"|9571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9571-hollinndagain/|8.1|Mark Richardson

Ever since the first flush of British punk rock, the Rough Trade system has been crucial to-- sometimes even synonymous with-- independent music in the UK. A more open question might be how much those shops should mean to us today, and how, and why. Rough Trade has tried to answer that question mainly by doing what all good record stores do, only on CD: Its themed historical compilations-- for singer/songwriters, or electronic music, or vintage indiepop-- are like particularly useful sale displays, and its annual <em>Counter Culture</em> compilations do the same thing as that Staff Recommendations bulletin board at your local shop. Note the pun in the title: They're quick to remind you that there's still a physical counter, somewhere out there, probably covered in promotional stickers.</p><p>
<em>The Record Shop</em> is Rough Trade's 30th anniversary collection, and for these discs they've brought in 30 luminaries-- musicians, critics, writers, fashion folks-- to pick one track each from across the store's history. Funny, then, that despite that-- and the lavish book-style package, filled with photos and notes from each selector-- this doesn't feel much like self-congratulations: It feels far more like a love letter to the old and possibly antiquated model of physical, brick-mortar-and-counter record shopping. It's a big wet kiss to the whole process of going to a specific, cherished location, thumbing through haphazard piles of plastic-covered objects, and asking actual nearby people questions about what's underneath. All of which has been largely replaced by something far more democratic and convenient and, depending on whom you ask, less annoying: Sitting down at your computer, consulting reviews and databases and forums, and downloading your Trentemøller remixes direct from overseas, while teenagers yell at you in all caps for having mislabeled tracks in your download folder.</p><p>
    Here's the weird part: If you think that it doesn't really matter either way-- that it's all about the music, etc.-- the chronological tracks on these discs might convince you otherwise. It gets going, after some Modern Lovers, with the kind of post-punk gems the Rough Trade name is most associated with: a joyous bounce from Swell Maps, the arty Swiss punk girls of Kleenex, the impossibly hyper Rezillos. Recent tracks on the other end of things are just as in line with current tastes: There's a track from Matmos, LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"" as the perfect record-shop closer, Björk, ""The Light 3000"". And there are plenty of the sorts of things that music-geek vinyl-thumbers have always loved to dig for, whether in 1980 or 2006: former Can member Holger Czukay doing shimmery exoticism with tape loops, an old-timey cut from the Carter Family, old folk from Karen Dalton, some terrific Ethiopian jazz. But somewhere along the line, we dip into an underground music aesthetic that seems almost unthinkable today.</p><p>
    Keep in mind that before the internet, most of us had very little amateurism in our worlds: There was not so much trash. Understanding independent music of the 1980s requires remembering this, I think, mainly so we understand why so much of it was ugly and vulgar and <em>obsessed</em> with trash. The record store looms large here, because it was one of few places a person could go to dig through racks and come out with something like an album by a band called LARD with a disgusting sucking fish on the cover, and filled with sludgy grinding and spastic Jello Biafra yelping (""The Power of Lard"" appears here). This was an era of bands called things like Bongwater (""His Old Look"" appears here) and generalized who-cares slop and humor from artists who were pretty sure nobody would ever care about them. 
    </p>
<p>
    And there was something about digging for this amazing, seemingly random trash in grotty bins-- or mail-ordering it from crappy black-and-white ads in the backs of crappy black-and-white publications-- that feels like the exact antithesis of today's context, where there is enough trash and amateurism out there that it sounds like exactly what it is (trash), and there's so much music at our fingertips that we expect musicians to deliver something genuinely great, not amaze us with junk. Now it's the electronic thrill of something tight and lively beaming over from Norway or the Congo, rather than the weird excitement of seeing the crap in your own life-- sliced baloney, Saturday morning cartoons, a picture of a toilet on the LP cover-- suddenly and weirdly for sale as a physical object, some other band of freaks infecting your space.</p><p>
    So we go from ""just like us"" to ""please god anything but <em>us</em>."" Pardon me if that sounds like nostalgia: The truth is that a lot of that stuff sounds <em>terrible</em> to me now, and I kind of thrill to the moment where this compilation's perfectly great Skinned Teen track gives way to Bikini Kill's live-wire ""Capri Pants"", and even more to the moment after that where we come to Stereolab and Nurse With Wound's ""Simple Headphone Mind"", long a big prize for the kinds of Stereolab fans who dig through crates. By this time, the comp's well into the elegant 90s. It's a strange reminder, though, of how much the way you get your music can affect the actual music that sounds good to you-- and how much it can affect the way the whole process feels, and why you do it, and what you're getting out of it. It's hard to say how much the actual tracks here make a case for the record store-- I could download most of these to my computer in about 15 minutes, even just using a couple legal subscription services, and without having to take off my bathrobe-- but they certainly manage to say something about that counter-based culture, and what a difference it can make. 
    </p>
<p>
    As for actually buying it, the problem-- besides prohibitive expense-- turns out to be that the kind of ardent shoppers being fetishized here can probably find this stuff for themselves.

    Two decades and 14 albums in, British guitarist Matthew
    Bower offers the first Skullflower full-length on which he makes every sound.
    That's not really a surprise, as the band has centered on Bower for a while.
    What is surprising is how extreme and impenetrable <em>Tribulation</em> is. Previous Skullflower
    releases mixed aggressive noise with dark metal, Kraut-ish drone, and drifting
    ambience. But <em>Tribulation</em> is an
    unrelenting onslaught, the most annihilating Skullflower release to date. Every
    second of its 66 minutes poses an unwavering challenge to the ears, as
    far-flung as notorious landmarks like Lou Reed's <em>Metal
    Machine Music,</em> Whitehouse's <em>Dedicated
    to Peter Kurten, </em>and anything from the outermost reaches of the
    Japanese underground (Merzbow, Masonna, CCCC, etc.)</p><p>
    So it's kind of hard to recommend <em>Tribulation</em>
    to anyone whose tolerance for noise-as-music has even the tiniest limit.
    (For the cautiously curious, 1994's heavy <em>Carved Into
    Roses</em>, 1995's mellowed <em>Transformer</em>, and
    last year's rumbling space-rocker <em>Orange Canyon Mind</em>
    are better bets). But given that <em>Tribulation</em>'s
    raison d'etre is full-on attack, its nine pieces are impressively dense and
    textured. Beneath the oppressive skin of Bower's noise lies bubbling layers of
    color and static. Like a cadaver supplied to a medical student, these tracks
    reward close inspection if you can stomach the task of tearing into them.</p><p>
    Bower doesn't make it easy: <em>Tribulation</em>
    begins with his toughest, gnarliest noise, which continues unabated
    through the first five tracks. Launching abruptly into the slicing treble of
    the aptly titled opener ""Lost In The Blackened Gardens of Some Vast
    Star"", Bower makes reams of sound that fill and remold your ears like lava
    poured into plastic. The peak is ""Dying Venice"", which alternately
    conjures mechanical birds chirping away, the cries of a broken dot-matrix
    printer, and a flute symphony played by an orchestra of tailpipes.</p><p>
    On the sixth cut, ""Void of Roses"", <em>Tribulation</em>
    starts to pull back slightly. There's no loss of energy or volume, but Bower
    allows things to breath a bit. The metal drones of Sunn0))) and Earth come to
    mind, but where those bands prefer columns of sound that vibrate like huge
    tuning forks, Bower opts for pointed noises that perform a kind of sonic
    acupuncture. ""Dwarf Thunderbolt"" grinds through ringing tones, while
    the album's highlight, ""Silver Stars Rot Mindlessly..."", uses
    guitar-hero feedback and cymbal-like crashes, sounding like a metal band
    melting inside a huge fire. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are many more hallucinations to be found in <em>Tribulation</em>, and they seem to morph with every
    listen. As far as I know, Bower has made no Lou Reed-style claims that he put
    any specific patterns inside his noise, and <em>Tribulation</em>
    is less a magic eye painting than a Rorschach test. Its shapes and figures
    likely reside in the ear of the beholder. But such discoveries would be
    impossible without the thick, heavy canvas that Bower has woven.

    This album's first 10 seconds: a cavernous wind, an elliptical backwards sample, and 22-year-old East Londoner Ben Drew announcing that it's his ""time,"" calling those of us on the receiving end of his lecture ""fucking cunts"" who'd ""best listen up."" Expecting his audience to tolerate such abuse requires a wildly self-serving imagination; this rapper is like Shakespeare's Richard III giddily wooing the widow of a guy he just killed. Opening track ""Kidz"" definitely wants to have it both ways (á la Larry Clark's cautionary/titillating film of virtually the similar name), indulging in myriad violent/sexual fantasies, but chorus-filing the first-person rant away as a (cliché) moral editorial about ""kids today.""</p><p>
    Five minutes worth of freshman Freud helps to synopsize all of side A, during which castration fear abounds. Each track oversalutes the speaker's dick, a phallus whose power is constantly under threat from eager vaginas rife with disease. The repeated images of throat-slitting obviously refer to a need to figuratively emasculate rivals (see the hip-hop tradition of penis-editing terror that dawns with Grandmaster Flash's ""trying not to lose my head,"" running through ""King Kut"", the 1990s fixation with ""peeling caps back,"" and even ""Where's Your Head At""). Taboos such as anality and necrophilia are alternately seductive and horrifying, as the speaker waffles between primal and civilized urges. Resentment of an inability to monopolize the female parent's sexual attention surfaces on ""Mama (Loves a Crackhead)"". The forbidden youthful desire for the sister is fulfilled on ""Charmaine"", about a 14-year-old who can be humped because her ""enormous"" breasts constitute ""real woman""-hood (after an intimidating encounter with the ""shiny head"" of an oversized ""doorman""). The first seven of these 14 songs peaks with the blindingly Oedipal ""I Don't Hate You"", a massive takedown of a father ill-fated by his intimacy with the gods.</p><p>
    The second half wakes up from a dreamstate to analyze it; the speaker wonders aloud at his subconscious reasons for his behavior. The music-- previously reliant on two guitar chords (either played mournfully or Doobie Bros-fully) over huge drum loops-- recedes into the trappings of sophistication: ""Everyday"" owes its titanicness to the lack of an anchoring beat, electing to subsist on a chamber-pop requiem. I'm tempted to think that B has heard the transcendent and beautiful drumless bootlegs of Terror Squad over Modest Mouse and the Streets over Red Hot Chili Peppers (by DJs Erb and Simon Chapman, respectively). The track reveals that, somehow, the syncopated bottom-end of most rap anthems serves to mellow the urgent lyrics rather than intensify them. Diddy even begins his new album over a Tears For Fears sample that never ""kicks in""; what I'm trying to say is that hip-hop can go ""ambient"" without succumbing to (let's not name names) avant-garde paroxysms. 
    </p>
<p>
    The redundant thuggishnesss of side one (talking tough shit about being sick of people talking tough shit?) gives way to the staccato piano of side two's brilliant debunking of gangsta poseurs, ""Where Ya From"". The early addiction-rants and stoner-reveries yield to the condemnation of drug use that is ""Missing Links"". Fans of unbowed hardness will probably be made ill by ""Couldn't Get Along""'s trucey soft-rock percussion, tear-verge vocals, and Phillip-Glass-meets-<em>""</em>The Young and the Restless""<em> </em>musicianship. 
    </p>
<p>
    Plan B manages to milk his biographical plight without resorting to the childhood-trauma-as-pissing-contest tactics of most memoirists, even if he does exceedingly privilege death as a harbinger of realism. (In fact, some of his efforts reveal melodramaturgy similar to the convenient resolutions of ""issues-based"" cinema such as <em>Traffic </em>and <em>Crash</em>.) The darkness can be a little much, because he's never flat-out ridiculous like, say, Fear smirk-singing about nun assault, but B's cauldron of bits from the Bible, Nas, and Prodigy gets lightened a tad by shout-outs to Coolio and Hall &amp; Oates.
    </p>
<p>
    Still: dude's named himself after an emergency contraceptive-- what do you want? He's too busy pointing out how elements of mainstream (Michael Jackson, TV news) and high (<em>Irreversible</em>, <em>City of God</em>) culture are as bilious as their low or underground counterparts to even bother caring about his own supposed genre; the electrocrash of Hadouken's (non-album ) remix of ""No More Eatin"" is more grime than anything on <em>Who Needs Actions When You Got Words</em>, which pretty much sounds like a UK Sage Francis produced by Everlast. (The BBC calls his music ""urban."" So, what, Jarvis Cocker is ""rural""?) And to be fair, the album's sensitive wrap-up contains consecutive songs about rendering folks toothless; Freudians claim that the loss of choppers symbolizes impotence. Regardless, ""I Don't Hate You"" bears some of this year's sharpest fangs.

    The songs on Montreal
    singer-songwriter Angela Desveaux's debut album, <em>Wandering Eyes</em>, sound so familiar that I keep flipping through my subconscious Rolodex of
    Lilith Fair lineups (Sarah McLachlan? Shawn Colvin?), alt-country warhorses (Gillian
    Welch? Lucinda Williams?), Laurel Canyon
    folktresses (Judee Sill?), and alt-radio also-rans (Amanda Marshall? Tracy
    Bonham?), in order to place the source. Of course, there isn't one: None of these 10 songs are covers; instead, this déjà vu hints at Desveaux's gifts for blending
    strains of folk, pop, and country into a naturalistic whole and for penning
    songs that sound immediately, comfortably familiar.</p><p>
    These are qualities reinforced by her lyrical and vocal restraint.
    Desveaux isn't a showy singer; her voice is plain as the peeling wallpaper on
    her album cover, but she has a subtle feminine steeliness that comes from
    through on slower, sparser songs like ""Feel Alright"". Lyrically, she withholds
    concrete details or specific references, trading instead in cursory
    descriptions of romantic conundrums-- what some might call traditional pop
    songwriting, in that she often tries to nail down a specific predicament or
    emotion in just a couple of minutes. She speaks the alt-country language
    fluently and fluidly, mastering the arts of the chipper chorus on opener
    ""Heartbeat"" and of confessional gravity on ""If Only"".</p><p>
    This sort of tasteful alt-country, however, seems like a
    highly competitive genre at the moment, crowded with mainstays like Lucinda and
    indie soloists like Amy Millan and Jenny Lewis, not to mention Nashville
    upstarts like Julie Roberts and Ashley Monroe working these styles and sounds
    back into country radio. To differentiate yourself from the pack, you need a
    strong personality to come through in your singing and songwriting. This
    commodity seems sparse on <em>Wandering Eyes</em>.
    Backed by a band that's merely capable but never really outstanding, Desveaux
    plays the part too perfectly, too politely, with no rough edges or
    imperfections to suggest much of an identity behind the songs. As a result,
    even at their darkest, these songs never seem to have very high stakes: on
    ""Heartbeat"" and ""Familiar Times"" she sings about keeping her emotions firmly in
    check, but there's never any convincing danger of losing control. The same
    lyrical and vocal restraint that makes <em>Wandering
    Eyes</em> sound so warmly familiar also renders the album bland and hollow, such
    that by the time the closer ""Good Intentions"" fades out,  you still have no sense of the person behind
    the songs. Anyone could have written them; anyone could be singing them.

    Nellie McKay is a brat, one assumes. And as much as we'd
    like to open a review about her sharp new album with heaping helpings of praise
    for her glimmering pre-rock pop confections, her swaggering indiscretions have
    made that impossible. Since her lauded debut, <em>Get Away From Me</em>, she's picked up a reputation as a tough cookie.
    Whether demanding her debut be a 2xCD affair or insisting on a title that
    openly mocked piano princess Norah Jones or worse still, rapping (badly), she's been something of an unshakable presence both
    on the web and in New York night clubs. After two delays in late 2005, McKay's
    label Sony/Columbia refused to put out her second album, <em>Pretty Little Head</em>, in
    its intended 2xCD (again) form. McKay, who had already moaned publicly
    about this and passed around her label chief's cell phone number at a concert,
    threw a tantrum and worked her way out of her deal (read: got dropped). The
    album subsequently leaked to the internet and has been available for some time
    before its arrival Tuesday on McKay's label, Hungry Mouse. It's a shame she's
    surrounded herself with all this quasi-controversy-- doubtful she'll ever have respectable
    sales numbers, so one questions all the fuss-- because <em>Pretty Little Head</em> is
    better than her debut. It's less showy, more confident, tighter, lacking antics-- it's confounding stylistically, just as her debut was, but less an act of
    throwing ideas at the wall.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Treading more fluently in cabaret pop and frisky lounge
    swinging, McKay, who self-produced the entire album, again inhabits that
    chipper, coquettish Doris Day coo while skewing modern with subject matter. On
    album opener ""Cupcake"", a dizzying parable about the act of declaring
    of love, she sings over uptempo percussion and finger-stubbing piano bashes,
    bellowing token phrases like, ""I need you in the morning…"" for more than two
    minutes before the perspective becomes clear: The song is meant to be sung by a
    homosexual male disco dancer to his lover. On first listen it's a cheap shot
    bait-and-switch move-- she even spells out ""G-A-Y"" in the lyrics. More time
    reveals McKay is not all that far from another piano-seated wiseacre, Randy Newman.
    And while Newman catches heat for a Disney-fied twilight, McKay's
    smarter stuff bares a strong resemblance to his early satirical
    work like ""Rednecks"" and ""God's Song"".</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Sadly, there is still some willfully inane songwriting that McKay here, the sort of stuff that gets her branded as a safe-not-safe wildcard artist (hence her
    lousy rapping, which has thankfully ceased). ""Columbia Is Bleeding"", a message song, chronicles the revelation that Columbia
    University practiced animal cruelty
    in their labs last year. McKay's indictment, cheerily delivered but caustic,
    even found its way to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2hPqc2YRMI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>YouTube</u></a>.
    It's heady but tough to take seriously. ""Pounce"", a 56-second jaunt, is about,
    um, pouncing ""like a pussy cat"" when something comes along that you like.
    There's lots of meowing, and unless you can believe this is some sort of
    exercise in jingle-writing (a possible career move for the adept
    phrase-turner), the song is fairly dumb. There's also the requisite yodeling
    number, called ""Yodel"". Harumph.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Nellie's not all gags and gasps, though. ""Long
    &amp; Lazy River"",
    one of the most rock-solid compositions here, is musty in its Ella
    Fitzgerald-style phrasing. Cyndi Lauper guests on ""Beecharmer"", and her clipped
    falsetto is a shock after 10 songs of McKay's knowing vocals. One suspects that
    Lauper and McKay get on well (the pictures inside the liners indicate as much),
    and their chemistry is goofily charming-- Lauper, 53, sounds like the kid in
    the equation. The other guest featured is k.d. Lang on the ecstatic, hymn-like
    ""Rumor Had It Right"". McKay can't hang with Lang when it comes to aged wisdom
    or vocal subtlety, but the
    conceit is another playful back and forth between two deeply expressive
    singers.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Whether crafting stone-faced chamber pop or flitting around
    on pink sheets singing bedroom torch songs, McKay shows she's got versatility
    in bunches on her second album. But even though she's cut down on the snarky
    commentary, one can't shake the feeling that she's putting more of her head in
    the music than her heart. It's only on the truly pristine songs, like the
    crystalline ""There You Are in Me"", that we get it-- she may be a brat, but it's
    the brains in her pretty little head that make McKay worth paying attention to.

    ""words are nothing but ineffectual in describing a body of music."" Not
    the most encouraging sentiment for a music reviewer, though he's probably right. And when it comes to the dense, wordless electronic opuses that are Clark's
    specialty, the written word can be an especially awkward translator. But just as Clark
    is drawn to explaining his ephemeral consciousness through brash beats and
    intricate melody, the urge to understand and champion such a compelling
    struggle is strong. While this underrated Aphex Twin disciple produces stunning
    machinated symphonies that are daunting in their technical proficiency, his
    music maintains a breathing, spontaneous dexterity. Falling in line with its
    title, <em>Body Riddle</em> encapsulates the ever-changing
    human form, part inexplicable being and part steadfast hardware. The continuous
    fluidity between those two states bolsters this puzzle's severe magnetism.</p><p>
    What sets the album apart from Clark's
    other detail-oriented click-traps is its jacked-up confidence and stylistic diversity.
    While his most recent album, 2003's overlooked <em>Empty
    the Bones of You</em>, was a brilliant, bleak apocalyptic vision, it could easily be
    broken down into two categories: corrosive manic panic and somber piano
    elegy. <em>Body Riddle</em>'s
    reach is grander and more assured with Clark now adding full
    flesh to the bone. The auspicious Brit infuses sonic streaks
    of contemporaries like Four Tet, Prefuse 73, and DJ Shadow into his repertoire,
    along with his usual Aphex and Boards of Canada tics. Significantly, these
    aren't thoughtless dilettante moves. The bright Four Tet-esque scutter of
    ""Night Knuckles"", for instance, is actually better than most of that
    artist's last LP. Similarly, the precision thump of ""Ted"" blows away
    anything Scott Herren's done in the last three years, and drum-programming
    clinic ""Herr Bar"" sounds like what Shadow should have done with his
    latest disc. This apprentice-master one-upmanship goes all the way to enigmatic
    godhead Richard D. James, who never seems to be far away from Clark's
    name on paper. Whereas James seems to be somewhat lost within his slippery
    mystique nowadays, Clark continues to mine his ominous
    perfectionism with increasingly spectacular ends.</p><p>
    Finely hewn and paced, <em>Body Riddle</em> ebbs and flows, following an internal logic that's condensed,
    myriad, and unpredictable. The album's convulsing dynamics are key to its humanity. Within a single track, drum patterns and tones slide
    in and out while melodies intermingle and seemingly incongruous noises blend
    into unannounced cameos only to slip away soon after. Take
    album-within-a-track spectacle ""Matthew Unburdened"", which kicks in
    touting glitch percussion and warbling piano. Then, the beat dismantles suddenly,
    coming back new and improved, now with strings that sear classical ache
    into the song's synthetic fabric. The old world instruments take center stage for a
    melodramatic aside, only to finally give way to a mannered hyper-jazz denouement.
    That's only one song. Simply, the amount of interlocking minutiae contained
    within the album's skin-tight 43 minutes is staggering.
    </p><p>
    The record's journey concludes with a eulogy, ""The Autumnal Crush"", which features <em>Body Riddle</em>'s only line of intelligible language:
    ""And I still miss you."" Emanating from this website, the words mean
    little. But, within the context of this remarkably realized whole, they're
    completely devastating. The accompanying track fades the LP's linear life cycle
    with a haunting expansiveness of My Bloody Valentine drowning beneath its own
    distortions. Few have been able to extract sweeping emotion from such a modern
    sonic milieu as Clark does here. Fright, sorrow, joy, love, death-- they're all within <em>Body Riddle</em>'s corporeal core, waiting to
    be whittled onto one's individual experience. It's a monumentally personal work
    that speaks universally; it's a glazed mirror that doesn't lie.

    notes slamming into clanging, chunky chords-- periodic ticks of dissonance
    tucked into harmonies. Like her piano playing, her voice is
    capable of almost spontaneous dynamic magic. Sometimes she howls; other times she performs in a near-whisper.
    Those are sufficient conditions for success as a performer and, possibly, as a
    songwriter, but people keep wanting to find more in her songs, like panaceas for whatever they feel is ailing American pop or Erica Jong novels condensed into a pretty two-minute
    ellipsis.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Hyvönen is complicit, if not culpable, in being taken either
    as a cute pop songbird or a feminist newcomer: She sings about cocks against
    thighs, homoerotic encounters, and one-night stands with candor and ease. She's just writing songs. But remember: She's a (European)
    (female) (piano-playing) songwriter who mentions Djuna Barnes, and this must be
    construed as statement of an ideologue unafraid to be naughty. Indeed, perhaps
    a female songwriter talking about the male anatomy and controlling her own
    sexuality would still be a valid critical point if, say, the last 60 years of
    recorded music-- from Mabel Scott's ""Baseball Boogie"" of 1950 (""Get your bat
    ready, baby/ If you can hit that ball, you can make a home run"") to Missy
    Elliott (You fill in the blanks)-- didn't exist.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Such a contextualized stance, after all, directly dismisses
    the album's real strengths and weaknesses. Hyvönen's an intelligent arranger; her
    turns on ""The Modern""-- the album's meta-crux, where she works to change the
    framework of affection, from its linguistic attachments to its
    mother-as-shelter constraints-- are brilliant, an up-down, merry-go-round
    keyboard countered by a springy piano that pokes fun at the main line's institutional
    insistence. Hyvönen sings a double round with herself on the chorus, two
    affected vocal takes-- like Björk stuck inside of a Victrola's horn-- crossing
    against each another. The brilliantly petulant ""You Never Got Me Right"" sees Hyvönen
    decide it was her lover who was wrong, not her, all in two minutes. By the end,
    she's screaming. She harmonizes with herself and a trumpet on the sole
    full-band track, ""Come Another Night,"" a sunny daydream plucked from Stuart
    Murdoch's brow. But Hyvönen occasionally misses: ""N.Y.""-- a big, bright-lights
    ballad fit for the arena, built on arbitrarily outdated imagery-- over-rings
    the longing bell.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    That's OK, though, as <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Until Death Comes</span><span> is a record about growing up and
    toiling through excitement and ennui. It's not a statement of philosophy as
    much as it is a realization of complete loneliness, the kind of void that can
    preside even when friends are around: </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Until Death Comes</span><span> opens with the impetuous, indecisive ""I Drive My
    Friend"", Hyvönen's faintly multi-tracked monotone lamenting the longest short
    drive of her life. Her lover is riding shotgun, and she's taking him to the airport,
    trying to convince herself she has the strength to let him go. The upbeat
    regularity of her piano is mimetic of her car tires clicking over cracks in the
    asphalt, a rhythmically fast charge to a slow and painful defeat. Later, with
    the perfect ""Today, Tuesday"", she exploits that consequent void, letting on
    that she's been counting the days spent by herself. An expected season of snow
    leaves her fretful for her future. It's a quintessential coming-of-age moment, Hyvönen
    refraining, ""Do they remember the shape of my plan?"" moments before forgetting
    exactly where the right keys are. It's not unique, even if it's from a
    diminutive, pretty Scandinavian blonde who plays piano like a panther.</span>

    There's the voice, and then there's the room it was recorded in, the
    microphone used, the amount and type of reverb added, and the intricacies of
    the mix. Add together these and a dozen other variables and you arrive at a
    record's vocal presence. It can be dry and straight, like the singer is in the
    room and singing just for you. Or it can be processed to sound like a
    transmission from a dream. Every era of music has recording trends that fix a
    particular voice in time.</p><p>
    Yvonne Cornelius, the German singer behind Niobe, seems to have a thing for
    vocal presence. The 13 songs on her album <em>White Hats</em> vary in mood and
    color, some going for a light and acoustic bossa nova feel, while others glance
    at darker electronic abstraction. But the way she records, layers, and treats
    her voice is what really separates one song from the next. Each of the tracks
    has an ambience derived from the particulars of how her voice sounds; even when
    details of the song are forgettable, the character of her voice stays with you.</p><p>
    ""Well and Wise"" is at the impressionist end of the spectrum, as
    Cornelius doubles her voices and runs one take through an odd filter, which
    lends a mechanistic feel to her trilling neo-gospel phrasing. Behind her is
    little but space, just a few notes plucked on a bass and the barest hint of
    percussion every bar or two, and the stark accompaniment brings her warped,
    robotic tone into sharp relief. It's reminiscent of Jamie Lidell's experiments,
    the way familiar uses of the most human of instruments are bent and tweaked by
    computer to arrive at something alien. The less striking
    ""Phosphorous"" has a similar effect but with more fleshy
    instrumentation, this time some heavily reverbed guitar walking adds a David
    Lynch meets Santo &amp; Johnny quality. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Surround Your Hover"" is comparatively straight but still heavily
    stylized, aiming for a Brazilian feel with the plucked acoustic and shuffling
    beat. Here, and on the nylon acoustic-only ""The Hills"", with her
    singing left alone, Cornelius exhibits good instincts for jazzy pop phrasing,
    bending notes and slipping behind the beat to good effect. ""In the
    Sun"" references a different past, the soaking wet, echoplexed sound of the
    early to mid 60s favored by Lee Hazlewood, with Cornelius channeling Peggy Lee.
    </p>
<p>
    As the tracks jump in style from one to the next, from the dank and gothic
    dungeon setting of the title track to the silky, club-ready r&amp;b of the
    closing ""Cool Alpine"", you have to admire Cornelius' imagination for
    sound and ability to bring together so many different worlds on one record. On
    the other hand, none of these cleverly constructed tracks really jump out and
    demand to be played again. As songs, ultimately, they're just OK. And when you
    think of the associations and moods embedded in the way a voice is recorded,
    the old records that survived and endured to be listened to at another time did
    so because they were also great songs. Too much of <em>White Hats</em>,
    impressive as it can be, feels like an exercise.

    Any ex-Partridge Family member will tell you the main
    challenge being a teen musician rests on those make-or-break years between
    teenhood and adulthood-- that 18-24ish range where you ideally produce something
    profound, a rite of passage signifying the end of Weezer ripoffs and un-ironic
    lyrics about ice cream. For Ben Kweller, the clock's ticking. He's no 21st
    century Leif Garrett by any stretch of the imagination, but Kweller, like
    fellow former teen rocker Daniel John of Silverchair, appears uncertain of his
    next step after a short-lived grunge backwash band. Although his latest
    self-titled offering expresses a desire to sound adult, he overshoots the mark,
    creating an album of innocuous, world-wearied alt-pop that lacks the fun or
    energy to stay up past eleven.</p><p>
    On opener ""Run"", Kweller sets the tone for the
    album, bemoaning his accelerated rise and fall with a grandiose,
    Springsteen-esque piano hook that deflates into a nondescript acoustic ditty,
    Kweller never failing to remind us how exhausting the journey's been:
    ""Empty hands/ Tired feet/ I run with you...Since fifteen/ I have run/ Everywhere you can run."" In a nutshell, the song encapsulates the
    album, a wistful sigh garnished with homogeneous Ben Folds-style accompaniment
    and a 24-year-old's midlife crisis.</p><p>
    Sure, cozying up in Ben Folds' soundscape ain't such a bad
    idea for Kweller, who's roped a cult following co-opting Folds'
    silly-yet-sensitive shtick. However, Kweller's ballads consistently lack the
    gravitas to drop like ""Brick""'s, and his more upbeat hooks need
    sharpening. In the past off-kilter songwritnig masked these ho-hum raw skills, best exemplified by <em>Sha-Sha</em>'s playful title track or goofball
    anthem ""Wasted and Ready"". Now, Kweller paints strictly inside the
    lines. Even on the album's de facto rocker, the corn-fed slice of Americana
    ""This Is War"", he sounds suffocated by a sense of Tom Petty formalism,
    hushing what could've been an apolitical yet awesome boot-in-ass titular
    refrain.
    </p>
<p>
    Occasionally Kweller's protractedly grown-up sound emits
    pathos worth feeling for, like on languished ballads ""Nothing Happening"" and
    ""Penny on the Train Track"". Unfortunately though, most sad sack numbers here
    wallow in a shallow sense of self-pity. The twilight-of-career feel of this work-- Kweller
    played every instrument on the album himself-- simply doesn't ring true. Not that
    I'm prescribing a drug cocktail bender or traumatic experience for the guy, but
    it'd help Kweller to continue writing the script to his once auspicious career
    rather than practically eulogizing it-- and hey, don't be afraid to have some fun
    out there for a change.

In <em>The World Is Gone</em>, I've finally found it. Admittedly this is like saying you've been looking for a record to validate the promise you hear in hip-hop and found in it <em>Endtroducing</em>. But hey, you can't pick your friends.</p><p>
    Dubstep, if you don't read Martin Clark's ""Month In"" column or have an unhealthy addiction to British online record stores, is an offshoot of UK garage that, as the name might imply, foregrounds the bass-- <em>really</em> foregrounds the bass. So much so that a lot of dubstep records, great as they are, are useless on your iPod. And while this year has seen a slate of dubstep albums-- Burial, Boxcutter, Kode9-- that you and your cat can enjoy while doing the dishes in your studio apartment, <em>The World Is Gone</em> tops them all. This is mostly because it pushes the genre out of the club's doors and as far from the dancefloor as possible while still being, you know, dubstep. (Though some fans might argue that it's not. They can tell it to the marines. Or whatever the British equivalent of marines are.)</p><p>
    On his blog, critic Simon Reynolds said that the Various record is ""impossible to describe without it sounding a bit wank, really."" He's right. ""Dubstep plus folk,"" which is the Various Production aesthetic writ at its most micro-blurb basic, <em>does</em> sound like the worst thing ever-- even if it's more accurately described as ""dubstep plus breathy female chick vocals,"" which puts it in a much longer and less unique continuum of electronic dance records (though no worse for it). When trying to describe it to a friend, the light finally went off: ""Portishead 2K6."" (And judging by the advance press the album has 
    gotten, my great Portishead revelation wasn't as unique as I thought. 
    Pitchfork's Amy Phillips invoked the Bristol trio when the album was announced 
    on this very site's news section a few months ago. For all I know it's in the 
    press release, but you should always toss those things.)
    </p><p>
    And though I was joking about the Portishead thing, it's only partially off the mark. Just like Portishead pouring Beth Gibbons' sour times croon over the shy, midtempo hip-hop beats that were all the rage in the mid 90s, Various take the thump-thump-thump that's defined the sound of urban Britain in the early part of this decade and gives it what it's always been looking for: estrogen. For a genre (garage) that was so girly, its offshoots (dubstep and grime) are fulla boy's cooties. I can't count the number of times that I've listened to a dubstep track and thought <em>this is pretty great, but the simple addition of the human female voice would make it a masterpiece</em>. But rather than the shrill blasts of sexed-up, coke-nosed r&amp;b that wobbled on top of turn-of-the-millennium garage tracks, Various' voices are positively morose.
    </p>
<p>
    But <em>The World Is Gone</em> certainly won't make it into as many dinner party selections as <em>Dummy</em> did, which means that it won't become a record that screams ""mid-00s!"" in a decade. That also probably means it won't spawn a million terrible imitators. The reason is the beats, which snarl and boom or wibble and groan rather than creep and snap. ""Hater"" is ""Jigga What, Jigga Who"" run through the cheap-sounding reverb filter on my old 16-bit copy of Sound Forge. But the vocal at least leavens the hollow, metallic din, whereas a traditional dubstep track would have thrust the ugly, synthetic bassline in your ear.
    </p>
<p>
    Other songs on <em>The World Is Gone</em> aren't so forgiving. The title track is the darkest end of rave, complete with synth stabs that could shear the roof off a barn. ""Thunkk"" bites some Bernard Herrmann/<em>Psycho</em> strings and adds a monologue somewhere between beat poetry and the paranoid shortwave radio ramblings of the radical/lunatic fringe, while ""Lost"" blows a snarl of sooty, ugly noise in your ear as male screams and howls drown in the dust cloud. If this is trip-hop, it's the kind of trip where you wake up without a shirt on, covered in tree sap, and vowing to swear off hallucinogens this time for good. 
    </p>
<p>
    But ""Fly"", the final track, does away with beats and horrible noise entirely for the kind of synthetic-acoustic dark folk that's had reviewers reaching for the not quite right Anne Briggs or Shirley Collins comparisons. More than anything, <em>The World Is Gone</em> is the year's best goth record since <em>Silent Shout</em>, and with Halloween just around the corner and the leaves quickly being stripped from the trees by wicked winds, you can bet this is going to get ample headphone play while you're rushing through the city, bundled up against the cold.
    </p>
<p>
    And finally, I've got to mention the packaging. Various first appeared on the scene a year or two ago with a run of super limited edition 7"" and 12"" singles, all draped in the same gorgeous, pointillist ink drawings-- Alphonse Mucha meets Tim Burton meets Patrick Nagel-- with absolutely nothing in the way of artist info. Various have, thankfully, (sorta) resisted the urge to turn that anonymity into a marketing hook. And though the drawings are somewhat less beguiling shrunk down to fit a CD booklet and stuck behind plastic, the strange world Various' music and art calls up-- stark, grayscale, and full of beautiful, sad women and strange animal couplings-- has remained intact, available now to those without a turntable or a heavy amount of Boomkat credit card debt. <br/>

    the Dream Syndicate</span><span>
    and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Four Violins</span><span>,
    mention of his name conjures a vivid sound: The drone of a bow slowly sawing
    across violin strings. Not that his other achievements-- vital roles in the
    early minimalism of the Dream Syndicate, the early incarnations of the Velvet
    Underground, and the early experiments of American cinema-- aren't equally
    memorable. But it's hard to picture him without a violin in his hands.</span><span> </span></span></p><p>
    Recent archival releases on Table of the Elements are
    changing that perception, offering examples of Conrad's work with sine-wave
    oscillation (<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fantastic Glissando</span>) and audio vérité (<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Bryant Park Moratorium Rally</span>). <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Joan of Arc </span>is the most exciting recovery yet,
    a solo pump-organ improvisation created to accompany Piero Heliczer's film of
    the same name. Conrad recorded the piece in 1968 at the home of John Vaccaro,
    director of New York's notorious Playhouse of the Ridiculous. Not knowing how
    much music Heliczer would need, Conrad played Vaccaro's aging instrument for
    the entire length of a one-hour reel-to-reel tape. (Heliczer ultimately used an
    excerpt for his 11-minute film.)
    <span><span><span></span></span>
</span></p><p>
    As a display of energy and focus over an hour of
    unscripted time, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Joan of Arc </span><span>is simply impressive. Even more striking is how recognizable the
    piece turns out to be. On the surface, the pump-organ's low, moaning timbres,
    blurred by Conrad's lo-fi recording, share little with his violin's attacking
    treble. Rather than aggressive or sharp, his tone here is plaintive and often
    hymn-like. But the distinctive way he builds a drone, patiently layering and
    shifting it like wind and gravity shaping ocean waves, is unmistakable.</span>
</p><p>
    The result is an entrancing meditation that rivals the
    work of latter-day masters Charlemagne Palestine and Phill Niblock, as well as
    the post-rock ambience of Stars of the Lid and Flying Saucer Attack and the
    metal dirges of Sunn0))) and Earth. What sets <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Joan of Arc</span> apart is its all-alone aura.
    Drones often engulf their surroundings like a blinding snowstorm, but instead
    of evoking cold, dark landscapes, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Joan of Arc</span> feels warmly intimate, like
    crackling wood in a fireplace.
    </p>
<span><span></span></span>
<p>
    Among all the sounds one might expect here-- church-organ
    hums, cinematic chords, woozy groans-- lies a surprise: an odd kind of
    percussion. Conrad's mic registers his foot tapping on pedals and his fingers
    clicking keys, creating rhythmic sparks and ripples beneath his cycling drone.
    As the organ swells and shrinks, these tactile sounds keep the piece<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span>grounded. Conrad's long chords may
    blow your mind, but his tangible effort makes <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Joan of Arc</span> a dream come to life.
    </p>
<span><span></span></span>
<p>
    As fascinating as it is, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Joan of Arc</span><span> doesn't rank with Conrad's violin
    classics. It's more snapshot than masterwork, a private moment made with little
    expectation of an audience beyond the few who would see Heliczer's film.</span><span> </span>But Conrad's willingness to pour so
    much thought and vigor into something so small makes <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Joan of Arc</span> much more than a footnote to his
    storied career.

Maricich is in the middle of ""Pardon Me""; she's just sung the part that goes <em>and I lay, before youuu</em><em> </em>and now entering the speakers is the bridge, what the liner notes call a ""melodic interpretation of the first verse""-- a plastic-horn synth line, honking bass, G-Funk winding organ, and handclaps. Maricich is alone onstage-- her bandmate, YACHT's Jona Bechtolt, is on a tour of his own-- and there's no singing during this part, no instruments for her to play. With a visible gulp, she steels herself; and as the bridge hits she takes off across stage, shaking her shoulders, bouncing up and down, four feet up onstage from the crowd and totally by herself. You feel awful for her and touched at the same time.</p><p>
    It wasn't always this way: Prior to <em>Paper Television</em>, the Blow was a solo operation, and Maricich alone could never make tracks like these, crowded with wobbly, stuttering snares and claps, keyboarded flutes, horns, and crowd noise interpolations. Credit for these belongs to Bechtolt-- a cracked-laptop wizard who, as YACHT, has been pulling a similar beats/karaoke/dance routine live for three or four years. His production is a brilliant and versatile grab bag of popular culture, equal parts Missy Elliott-style chart rap and Yaz'n'Soft Cell-like new wave keyboard pop, all shook up and spit out sideways.</p><p>
    Now and then, Maricich and Bechtolt run through public airwaves and pop music like what's there is theirs for the taking. It didn't always feel like they were giving back: They got to be artistes, artists were source material, and we the incidental audience. Not so here: ""We have a new record, and we didn't rip anything off to do it-- we swear."" This is how Khaela Maricich decides to introduce the one song she didn't really write-- her take on a Police jam-- back in New York.
    </p><p>
    The communal vibe is heavy in the club, and it's to celebrate <em>Paper Television</em>, a wickedly generous and clever record of not-quite love songs and elaborately metaphored stabs at the rituals of simple human communication. At the show, as on the record, love is compared to gold, consumer goods, god, even the Louvre. Getting busy is a business negotiation or a threesome with a guy and the greater universe. Sometimes lovers are vigilantes and rebels; other times they're lawyers reluctantly hashing out contracts. ""You should treat us good,"" admonishes Maricich. ""If you do that then you know we're gonna, unh, unh, unhhh share more of our goods with you."" Or on ""Parentheses"": ""Some philosophies fuel a belief in the self/ Constructed to keep one's goods on one's own shelf.""  
    </p>
<p>
<em>Paper Television</em><em> </em>wants them off the shelf and shared. ""Parentheses"" sets love in a supermarket and helps its lovesick protagonist through the store, with a heartbreaking verse: ""If something in the deli aisle/ Makes you cry/ You know I'll put my arm around you/ And I'll walk you outside."" On ""Pardon Me"", Maricich plays it cool, asking, ""Pardon me, but wasn't that your heart?"" before betraying herself and stepping up her vocal one strained register per confessional word: ""I believe. A heart. Is made. To feel. The things. That lay in front of it,"" lashed at the end by a snare snap and that forbidding dance bridge. 
    </p>
<p>
    Bechtolt can play along, laying back with cowbells and snaps and gauzy synth swells, but he also stretches Maricich in new directions. ""The Big U"" is remarkably apt Neptunes minimalism, a ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" for the emo set-- throbbing, whispery bass, clucks and clicks, Maricich muttering and saying ""yeah"" over the quiet funk. On ""The Long List of Girls"", Bechtolt breaks out drumline snare rolls and stick clicks-- too ambitiously, as Maricich has to almost rap to keep up-- but it's beyond familiar, and totally unexpected. 
    </p>
<p>
    The story Maricich is telling-- she's got a heart that doesn't want to go out and get hurt in the world, but she's trying to talk her heart into going out anyway-- is wildly endearing. Her love, on ""Fists Up"", is both a fortress and a museum (the Louvre, to be exact), and she keeps trying to let it out but her man demands proof, which makes it go hide again; on ""Eat Your Heart Up"", she asks her reluctant heart ""Oh my heart, where would we start? What would we do? And what would people think if they saw me out with you?"" We have though, and the pair look just about perfect.

<em>Little Things</em>, the debut album by Norwegian singer-songwriter Hanne Hukkelberg, was an endearing mosaic of intimate jazz and fractured pop miniatures, its sonic fragments meticulously gathered and assembled over the course of two years. Following the album's release, Hukkelberg relocated for a time to Berlin, where she wrote much of the material that would become her second full-length, <em>Rykestrasse 68</em>. Judging by the results, this was a shrewd artistic move, as here the self-assured Hukkelberg expands her work out onto a grander cinematic scale, casting her new songs with a vivid depth of field worthy of a Nino Rota film score. And though the album is cultivated with the same melodic delicacy as her debut, nearly all of her songs here are undercut by cross-currents of emotional turbulence, their every polished facet barely concealing the music's inward conflicts and hidden turmoil.</p><p>
    This quiet dissonance is immediately evident on the introductory ""Berlin"". Framed as a romantic street scene, Hukkelberg's narrator soon finds her attention turned to ""my neighbor's balcony/ Old bullet holes/ Behind wild botany."" As with <em>Little Things</em>, Hukkelberg recorded <em>Rykestrasse 68</em> with the assistance of veteran producer Kåre Vestrheim. For this opening track they weave ambient street recordings almost invisibly into their subtle mix of strings and woodwinds, making it feel as though the song were simply an organic outgrowth of the city's vibrant and scarred landscape, with Hukkelberg's honeyed voice settled casually inside the din.</p><p>
    On <em>Little Things</em>, Hukkelberg incorporated such stray objects as wire brushes and bicycle spokes into her dense arrangements, but in some instances these found sounds were processed beyond recognition, slipping anonymously into the album's crowded sidewalks. Here, however, she makes more strategic use of these supplemental ingredients, allowing each additional sound effect or exotic instrumental flourish to retain a natural form and figure, ensuring for their maximum dramatic impact. For the existential narrative ""The Pirate"" (""A dive into infinity/ The rocks pull him down"") Hukkelberg's woozy blend of accordion, sing saw, and piano effectively mirror the downcast lyrics with an appropriate seasick lurch, while the atmospheric fable ""The North Wind"" is deftly augmented by clacking typewriter keys and shimmering wine-glass glissandos. 
    </p>
<p>
    As a vocalist, Hukkelberg is at her cagey best on the deceptively sunny likes of ""A Cheater's Armoury"", the album's first single. One can't help but detect the shadow of a bitter smile across her lips as she dresses down the song's seductive villain (""You gamester/ You fool us/ We watch your spinning wheel/ And the longer it takes for us to heal"") purposefully leaving it unclear whether she's addressing a failed lover, friend, or political leader. Likewise, her dusky cover of Pixies' ""Break My Body"" simmers fiercely beneath its cryptic wounds, her deliberate, jazz-inflected enunciation giving new intensity to the song's abstracted violence. Less abstract-- yet even more compelling-- is the album's penultimate track, ""Ticking Bomb"", which translates a dense code of psychic distress across a shifting canvas of agitated piano, ad-hoc <em>Mule Variations</em> percussion, and smashed beer bottles. It's an astonishing performance, one that might've seemed more likely from someone like PJ Harvey than from the pristine songstress of <em>Little Things</em>. But here, as with all the best pieces from <em>Rykestrasse 68</em>, Hukkelberg proves willing to allow a little discord to into her carefully orchestrated surroundings, and her captivating work is all the richer for it.

    Less than three years ago, Cincinnati producer Hi-Tek-- then known almost
    exclusively as the primary sound architect for Rawkus' brief, romanticized run
    atop underground rap-- showed up in the liner notes of G-Unit's <em>Beg For
    Mercy</em>, the debut from 50 Cent's nascent crew. This was shocking but not
    without precedent. In fact, Tek had worked with Snoop Dogg a year prior on <em>Paid
    tha Cost to Be da Bo$$</em> and had been tabbed by Dr. Dre to become a member of
    his Aftermath production inner circle. Still, for many who held <em>Soundbombing</em>
    compilations close to their heart, the G-Unit association was a devastating
    revelation. Since then, Hi-Tek has impressively weaved between his bohemian
    friends and the likes of D12 to form a fairly reputable production history. His
    best beat ever is still a photo finish between Black Star's dusty
    ""Fortified Live"" and 50's pristine ""Bitch, Get In My Car""--
    two songs that couldn't be more different.</p><p>
    So Hi-Tek (né Tony Cottrell) arrives after this transformation with <em>Hi-Teknology</em>,
    an album many point to as Rawkus' last gasp. And it's almost exactly what we
    expect: confident, if underwhelming, stylistic leapfrogging. Yeoman's hip-hop.
    One minute Jadakiss rasps his way through an inspired bundle of distorted
    organs and tumbling piano rolls on the rousing ""Where It Started
    (N.Y.)"". Then Hi-Tek is re-teamed with his old Reflection Eternal partner,
    Talib Kweli-- one of three such collabos-- on the flute-laced, doily rap,
    ""Can We Go Back"". It's a sentiment Kweli has long begged for, despite
    things moving further and further from 1998 as the days pass.</p><p>
    This kind of inconsistency is wonderful for cherry picking; the vibrant
    ""Josephine"", featuring Tek's parents as the Willie Cottrell Band, and
    a frisky Ghostface Killah yammering ""Yo, I know this chick from the hood
    named Courtney Cox/ And the brain is easy to pick like faulty locks/ She's
    awfully hot, asshole burnin' like Tabasco/ She used to be thick, it's like
    'Where the hell the ass go?'"" is a perfect mid-album soul quencher. 
    </p>
<p>
    Album closer ""Music For Life"", featuring deceased compatriot J
    Dilla and a fierce verse from Nas (who has always done nostalgia 10 times
    better than Kweli), best approximates the groove he so often relied on in the
    late 90s, a shimmering flute loop over snares that sound like drummed empty
    bottles. One of the few hyper-commercial moments comes on the clearly Dr.
    Dre-inspired ""1-800-HOMICIDE"" featuring The Game. Its tense string
    plucks and West Coast r&amp;b chorus, sung by Aftermath crooner Dion, are
    quintessential Dre-jacking. Later, Devin the Dude and Bun B, Texas' two active
    best voices, show up for a weighty jam that only serves to remind us that
    Devin's follow-up to <em>To Tha X-Treme</em> and UGK's reunion album can't come
    soon enough. 
    </p>
<p>
    So there's a Texas song, a West Coast song, an NYC song, a Busta Rhymes
    song, and so on... This is the problem with Tek's elasticity: Without a primary
    style to lean on, we get a grab bag of strong records. The only unifying factor
    is that Tek can rock as smoothly with a bulldog like The Game as he can with
    mush-soul songstresses like Floetry's Marsha Ambrosius. Without the punishing
    consistency of say, <em>The Chronic</em>, or the daring oddity of Quasimoto's <em>The
    Unseen</em>, we're left with nothing but a glorified mixtape.

    It would be difficult to argue that the Feedelity label remains a
    well-kept secret now that its founder and main artist Hans-Peter
    Lindstrøm has become such a ubiquitous presence in dance music. If
    anything, it's tempting to ask whether, in October 2006, it's too late
    to get excited about Lindstrøm's brand of epic disco revivalism. However, <em>It's a
    Feedelity Affair</em> is packed with tried-and-true musical
    strategies for putting on a spectacle, and this overdue round-up of
    some of the greater and lesser-known Lindstrøm tracks off his 10 or so vinyl
    releases from the past few years makes clear that the Norwegian
    artist's production style remains as invigorating as ever, despite many
    of these deeply familiar tunes now approaching half a decade in age.
    Can we chalk this resilience up to timelessness, or simply good timing?</p><p>
    Partly it's just that disco never goes out of fashion. In dance music the question is always ""which disco?"", and it's a feature of Lindstrøm's music that it would feel at home alongside so many of the responses to this question that have been offered in the past decade, from the classicist disco of Faze Action in the late 1990s, to Metro Area's italo-disco, to the (so hot right now) ramshackle ""hippie"" disco peddled by Rub'N'Tug and the like. 
    If the narrative arc of this crate-digging strand of disco fetishism moves from precision and chops to bleary swirl and ecumenical unpredictability, the secret to Lindstrøm's music is how it manages to be all these things at once. Even at his briskest and most uptempo (see the efficient pump of the appropriately titled early single ""Fast and Delirious""), Lindstrøm can't resist woozy synth effects, pompous chord changes, and atmospheric percussion; conversely, the collection's most hippy moment, the torpid dub-disco of ""Music (In My Mind)"" (complete with deliciously smacked-out female vocals) nonetheless retains a delicate, expensive muso sheen.</p><p>
<em>It's a Feedelity Affair</em> largely foregoes the multi-hued fragrancy and soft-rock glide of Lindstrøm's recent work with Prins Thomas in favour of ostentatiously astral motifs (particularly roaming, noodly synth solos) and more pronounced dancefloor grooves, and it invites the conclusion that the producer's strongest solo efforts are also his most tunnel-visioned. The album's lofty peaks are the now instantly recognisable chill sci-fi sheen of ""I Feel Space"" and the stately, widescreen bleeps of new track ""The Contemporary Fix"", whose stereopanning percussion, shards of glistening dulcimer, and endlessly percolating 303 bass aspire to a majestic strain of minimalism that could go anywhere. It's difficult to know whether Lindstrøm would be better served pursuing this line of flight from plush disco, or to follow the path he's taken with Thomas, concocting ever-more sumptuous flights of multi-instrumentalist fancy, such as on their gorgeous, Henrik Schwarz-style remix of Tosca's ""Zuri"". Either way, it's probably a good idea for him to now steer clear of the warm space-disco which dominates <em>It's a Feedelity Affair</em>, if only because there's little point in attempting to top his past achievements.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, even during the most representative and unashamedly retro
    moments here-- such as on the voluptuous 10-minute suite ""There's a
    Drink in My Bedroom and I Need a Hot Lady""-- Lindstrøm resists charges
    of being a one-trick pony, weaving together an unlikely assortment of
    elements in tracks that continually (if often subtly) change direction.
    The criticism is not entirely off-base: There is something almost
    gimmicky about his lush, organic instrumentation and overblown
    psych-out synth climaxes. But while Lindstrøm may be a showpony, his
    posturing is hard to resent when his tried-and-true strategies are
    deployed so decadently, almost carelessly, like stray crumbs escaping
    from a bottomless bag of tricks.

    By 1979, punk rock was a decadent parody of itself. As Sid Vicious was doing his best to off himself by heroin, many punks-- glue-sniffers, murderers, rabid leather spikers-- were on their way to joining him. Ronald Reagan and cocaine were ascending, disco was reaching its commercial peak, and the nascent post-punk genre hardcore was, to the extent that a bunch of 15-year-old boys were capable of articulating it, a response to both the musical and cultural moment in which they found themselves-- a music and movement in negation of damn near everything.</p><p>
    So there's some irony to the current wave of hardcore punk adoration and excruciatingly thorough documentation: Though Henry Rollins and Keith Morris are now, finally, inviting you to feel their quarter-century-old pain, the music to which they wistfully reminisce is vehemently anti-neophyte. But the music was, at best, half the story; the rest was something more vague, an amorphous mix equal parts camaraderie, radical politics, and geography.</p><p>
    Hardcore bands were inseparable from the scenes from which they hailed. D.C. was the intellectual and moral epicenter, L.A. its confrontational, aggro twin. The Midwest became the working-class wing of the movement, while New York and Boston offered its thugs and enforcers. Canada and Texas provided the scene's scant sense of humor. And compilations sprang up from each like anarchist manifestos. From its inception, D.C. Hardcore was synonymous with Dischord's <em>Flex Your Head</em> set, and when the city of Boston announced to the world that it too had a vibrant hardcore scene, it did so through a record deliberately titled <em>This Is Boston Not L.A</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>American Hardcore</em>, a soundtrack culled from the film of the same name, is a very different kind of compilation than those founding documents. Rather than strive to represent a specific scene, the curators of the film aim to represent the entire movement, tracing the broad arc of hardcore's musical and geographical progression. And if the soundtrack feels a bit clinical to those already familiar with the story, it's nevertheless an invaluable summary of a scene that did its best to defy easy categorization. 
    </p>
<p>
    The soundtrack begins, slyly, with a debate. Who wrote the first hardcore song? Was it Black Flag's ""Nervous Breakdown"" (track one); Middle Class's ""Out of Vogue"" (track two); or Bad Brains' ""Pay to Cum"" (track three)? Of the three, two are essential, whether primary or not: ""Nervous Breakdown"", from the Keith Morris era of Black Flag-- before Henry Rollins joined and Morris went on to form the Circle Jerks after being evicted from the band-- is arguably the group's finest moment, but ""Pay to Cum"" might be the greatest track to ever emerge from the genre as a whole. Bad Brains were older, smarter, and vastly more musically gifted than Black Flag or Middle Class, and they were inspired to the point of possession. At a minute-and-a-half, ""Pay to Cum"" is the quintessential hardcore document: impossible speed, raging, adenoidal vocals, a fantastically apt, melodic and urgent three-chord riff, a chorus worth repeating for days, and not a single wasted second. 
    </p>
<p>
    D.O.A. bat cleanup as the band that minted the genre's name (they titled their second record <em>Hardcore '81</em>) and the Circle Jerks round out the primordial bands. Then, joining Bad Brains and Black Flag as the godless third of hardcore's holy trinity, come Minor Threat. Bad Brains' protégés, articulators of the lifestyle choices that came to be associated with the music (read: straight edge), and led by Ian MacKaye, a guy more intelligent than most of the rest of his hardcore brethren combined, Minor Threat boast a discography that remains the gateway into a genre in which their greatness was (and still is) the one thing everybody agreed on. ""Filler"", with its ""<em>What happened to you?</em>"" sneer and repudiation of kids lost to mindless religion and loveless fucking, was the blueprint for a thousand goodbyes aimed at the larger world that dwelled beneath hardcore's exacting, self-contradictory standards. 
    </p>
<p>
    The rest of <em>American Hardcore</em> brilliantly walks the tightrope between scene and chronology. There's a prolonged stop in Boston-- cherry-picked from <em>Boston Not L.A</em>., and featuring Gang Green, the Freeze, Jerry's Kids, and SSD's still classic ""Boiling Point""-- a town notorious for being the most backward, close-minded, and violent of the early hardcore scenes: One episode in the movie has some knucklehead talking about staying at a kid's house on tour and threatening him with a baseball bat before robbing him blind; another has SSD calling out ""new wave faggots."" The city's sound brimmed with testosterone and metal-like chugging. New York would soon follow its lead (represented here, mercifully briefly, by an early Cro-Mags demo). 
    </p>
<p>
    Equally thorough is the compilation's trip through the Midwest (Negative Approach, Articles of Faith, and Die Kreuzen), then one of the scene's most political stomping grounds, and Texas (Big Boys, Really Red, D.R.I., and MDC-- but oddly, no Dicks), a violently punked-up area often ignored in histories of the genre. And last comes Flipper, a nod to San Fran, as well as a knowing implication of things to come; their grungy sludge augured both Nirvana (Dave Grohl's early band Scream also makes a cameo elsewhere on the comp) and a virulent strain of noise-rock. 
    </p>
<p>
    The film's curation is impeccable, but that doesn't mean there aren't omissions-- notably, the Necros, the Fix, Code of Honor, SOA, NegativeFX, and all of the borderline punk-to-hardcore bands, such as the Germs, Dead Kennedys, Hüsker Dü, the Minutemen, and the Dicks. Purists could also argue song selection for days (why not a better 7 Seconds track than ""I Hate Sports"", or ""My Father's Dreams"" instead of ""Bad Attitude"" by Articles of Faith?). And of course, the exciting coherence of early hardcore comps that repped scenes and held together both deep local friendships and common ideals is entirely absent here. But if <em>American Hardcore</em>, as a collection, fails to paint the whole picture, it does have one thing working in its favor: It contains more great music than any other post-punk-era document short of <em>Wanna Buy a Bridge</em>?, meaning there's little chance of finding a better summation of the music itself.

    In an inebriated interview with Rick McGrath in 1970, Bert Jansch, a
    26-year-old guitarist busy with British folk compatriots Pentangle, reclaimed
    folk dogma: ""We
    never talk about music, never. You talk about everything else, but never music.
    The only time we ever talk about music is to say, 'Let's have a rehearsal' and
    that's it. We get together and play.""</p><p>
    Recorded some 40
    years after his first two brilliant albums on England's Transatlantic Records, <em>The
    Black Swan </em>isn't exactly a comeback. Jansch has been working all along,
    releasing nearly a dozen albums since 1990. For this generation, however, it is
    Jansch's popular come-<em>out</em>: From Devendra Banhart to Ben Chasny, many
    principles of the indie roots resurgence have credited his complex playing and
    artless vocals as touchstones. That it's his Drag City debut and his first new
    material to see proper U.S. release since 2002's <em>Edge of a Dream</em> only
    increases its marquee billing and possible importance.</p><p>
    Thankfully, the
    album doesn't sound preconceived or laborious. It doesn't sound like it's been talked about. It's immaculate but natural, due
    in large part to producer Noah Georgeson, known best for Joanna Newsom's <em>The
    Milk-Eyed Mender </em>and Banhart's <em>Cripple Crow</em>. The litany of friends--
    Banhart, Beth Orton, Vetiver/Espers drummer Otto Hauser-- understand
    that threads through Jansch's career like plainsong treatments and topical
    variety are purposeful and worth presenting. They augment but don't tamper, and
    Georgeson captures it all with charm.
    </p>
<p>
    Surrounded by young artists, it's remarkable how well Jansch avoids buying
    into his myth. The kids add spirit without the avant tendencies of their
    regular gigs, and Jansch seems rightfully at ease and assured with this new
    band. ""When the children come to visit you/ You break into a smile/ They
    fill your heart with sunshine/ Just for a little while,"" he sings on the
    gorgeous ""High Days"", a sentimental ode to memories and friends like
    fellow Brit star Cliff Aungier. The title track's brief solo and Jansch's crisp
    cut through ""Old Triangle"" showcase a content but confident
    virtuosity he's rarely committed to tape. He even carefully draws from outside
    his own tradition: ""Texas Cowboy Blues"" is a presidential polemic
    funneled through a spirited panhandle country number, the form's rebellious
    imprecision subverted by Jansch's perfect fingerpicking.
    </p>
<p>
    It almost seems as though Jansch spent most of his four-decade career
    preparing for <em>The Black Swan</em> and its
    cast: His early solo work for voice and guitar staked out a clean, inventive
    style, focused on high fretting action in the left hand, an integrated system
    of hammers and drags that gave his instrument a thorough voice. With Pentangle,
    and later with Loren Auerbach in the 80s, he put that style into collaborative
    focus. His guitar playing-- somehow constantly understated and completely
    unorthodox-- has been the generous, enchanting source of it all.
    </p>
<p>
    It's the wellspring here, too: Helena Espvall's cello lines on opener
    ""The Black Swan"" dress Jansch's guitar and voice in winter gloves,
    warming the chill of his melody-- ""Every day is quiet and calm/ Like a
    lull before the storm""-- with perfectly paired playing. Otto Hauser's
    cymbal and hand-drum percussion and Paul Wassif's slide guitar on ""Woman
    Like You"" are likewise just shapely beds for Jansch's playing. Orton, who
    handles vocals on three tracks, is flawless and selfless, her austerity
    informed by each song's direction. She sounds like a weary survivor on
    ""When the Sun Comes Up"" and like a dejected soul on ""Katie
    Cruel"", a traditional folk song about withered glory.
    </p>
<p>
    On an album all about meeting maturity with vibrancy, Banhart alone mars the
    effect when he mismatches Orton's straightforward nerviness with an
    ultra-affected, reverb-buried vocal track on the gorgeously unsettling
    ""Katie"". Even though Banhart is attempting to recall the voice of his idol Karen Dalton, who brought this song to proper attention, he sounds like the dilettante, roving unnecessarily for the freak side, still in search of guidance. Perhaps the rest of this beautiful,
    elegant <em>Swan</em> will help him find his
    way.

Factor his limited output with his ongoing seclusion in upstate New York and     the general cultural eclipse of his style-- solo, steel string acoustic     guitar-- and it seemed a safe bet that he'd become a Cambridge trivia question,     a forgotten musician from a vibrant musical scene now dead and gone. But the     admirable Tompkins Square-- responsible for the recent reissue of albums from     Harry Tausig and Robbie Basho and for the promotion of musical heirs like Jack     Rose, Shawn David McMillen, James Blackshaw, and Sharron Kraus-- has stepped in to     present four new compositions from Walker. Rounding out <i>A Raga for Peter     Walker</i> are unheard tracks from his now contemporaries.</p>
<p>Walker once directed music for Timothy Leary's infamous     ""Celebrations"", in which Leary would rant to an acid-drenched     audience of thousands. He also played with Sandy Bull, the legendary     Indian-folk fusionist, and hung around with people like Joan Baez who, by the     end of the decade, would be far more famous than him. As a fixture of both the     Cambridge and NYC Village scenes, Walker was, like Bull, an early devotee of     Eastern musical traditions; during and especially after <i>Rainy Day Raga</i>,     Walker studied and experimented with the sitar and other then-exotic     instruments. After fading from the limelight and settling in Woodstock, he     apparently studied flamenco in Spain and kept up with his craft. Here on <i>Raga</i>,     it sounds as if he'd never left.</p>
<p>His 2006 playing is a marvel, halting and propulsive at     once. ""Day at the Fair"" moves awkwardly but inexorably forward with a     slow but insistent push, looping usually linear progressions around on     themselves. On ""Hot Fusion"", his cross-eyed phrasings sound like     reluctant play, strands gradually being woven together into an intricate whole.     Walker has the ability to distort time with his compositions, to move forward     or back as if there was no real difference.</p>
<p>Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny is quoted in the     press materials as saying ""Peter Walker was actually a bigger influence on     my acoustic playing than John Fahey or Robbie Basho""-- thus giving the     concept for the rest of the players on the record. Disappointingly, Chasny is     otherwise absent, but the gap is filled by musicians selected to pay homage in     his stead: James Blackshaw, Greg Davis, Jack Rose, Thurston Moore, Shawn David     McMillen, and Steffen Basho-Junghans.</p>
<p>Davis and Moore are the two most unlikely players here,     not known as folk musicians, and, perhaps consequentially, both are utterly     compelling. The former's ""Truly We Dwell in Happiness"" plays off a     laptop, with whispers and sleigh bells imitating guitar attacks, ultimately     spiraling up with dulcimer-like tones and bird trills. It's pristinely     beautiful and as organic as any folk released this year. Moore, not     surprisingly, takes the opposite tact: his ""Dirt Raga"" is a grimy,     buzzing strum held in place for five long minutes, a not-so-subtle nod to the     trance-like properties inherent in Eastern-influenced, fusion play. When it     finishes you feel as if you'd rolled in mud.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Jack Rose does a loose and meditative live     version of the sequel to ""Cathedral et Chartres"", from last year's     excellent <i>Kensington Blues, </i>and James Blackshaw provides a live take on     his ""Spiralling Skeleton Memorial"". Blackshaw is a technically     stunning young prodigy from the UK, and this song displays his raw ability; unlike Rose, he's yet to figure out how to make his stuff do more than just     shine brightly. When he develops more of a feel for his material, and can manage     the subtle variations that make Rose (and Walker) such consistently fascinating     musicians, he'll be less exhausting to listen to. The German Steffen     Basho-Junghans, nearly a contemporary of Walker's, pays homage with ""Blue     Mountain Raga""; the song's thoughtful, wide arches around its own central     melody are more grandiose than Walker's, but the two musicians build using the     same architecture.</p>
<p>Though a tribute to a near obscurity, <i>A Raga for     Peter Walker</i> feels accessible and new-- as low-key and quality an     introduction to the past, present, and future of steel string guitar as anyone     could want. We're lucky to have Walker with us again; lets hope he sticks     around this time.</p></div>"|9519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9519-a-raga-for-peter-walker/|7.4|Zach Baron

Their 2001 debut <em>Lycanthropy</em> was way ahead of indie's lupine fetish, but Patrick Wolf went and knicked that name for his higher-profile 2003 launch. Of course, in 2004 an instrumental group emerged called just Battles, which these guys might have beaten to mild prominence if they'd released these recordings (many of which are rumored to be around five years old) sooner. The Battles' organ-heavy collisions of polish with zonk-out would have had us Pitchfolk describing them as ""what would happen if the Shins were on Shimmy Disc"" or ""the New Zealand Pornographers.""</p><p>
    Abuse your allusion: The cover art's gentle sci-fi kiddie-porn is a throwback to a dozen metal, psych, and classic-rock sleeves. The first song (""Changes"") knowingly shares a title with classics by David Bowie, Black Sabbath, and Sugar. The second song (""Omega Man"") knowingly shares a title with subclassics by the Bee Gees, the Police, and Fred Falke (while copping a Bowie lyric). And so forth. ""Wonder…"" employs overtly Beatles-esque keyboards, ""Susan's Reply"" uses elegant echoes to retap the early days of ambient music, inverting the contemporary played-to-programmed ratio, ""(Make Love) in the Beds of Rivers"" spends its second half cheekily hybridizing nods to ""Feel Like Makin' Love"" and ""Wild Thing"", and ""We Were Right to Fight"" is a titanically fetching shoegaze synthesis of beatkeeping by the Velvet Underground, the Feelies, and Galaxie 500.</p><p>
    And then you have all the groovy Vancouver interplay. In addition to undeniable vocal (and intelligence-level) similarities to A.C. Newman's current collective, members of the Battles are in various studio and live manifestations of Destroyer. And just as the New Pornographers adopt Destroyer songs (""Jackie Dressed in Cobras""), the Battles rejigger verses from ""Streethawk II"", one of the few oldies that Destroyer plays live. The resulting track, ""Northern Man"", stops just short of midwifing a beef between Bejar (who sings Battles backup vox) and the also-Canadian author of ""Southern Man"", Neil Young.
    </p><p>
    Not that the listener could anywhere on this album presume to know exactly what Stephen Wood is singing about. He dodges profundity on purpose, often offering a philosophical first clause only to follow it with an awkwardly obvious line. The Battles seem happily unpeggable, ranging from tight power-pop to spacey effects-pedal-exploitation, from winky mayhem to a dreamy (occasionally even lifeless) lilt. Imagine, at this point in the review, snoozy sentences pointing out Kinksisms, Floydisms, Pavement-y passages, Tommy James snippets, etc. Wood reminds me of a schizophrenic fellow that I had to eject from my bookstore job years ago for autographing all the books; he demanded that I acknowledge his role in the ""continual chain of voices."" The songs on <em>Tomorrow's Eager Hands</em> eventually speak to <em>each other</em> via playful sequencing. Wood acknowledges this puzzle-building tendency when he sings, ""I have written this song before/ And it sounds a lot like this one.""

It'd be more forgivable if this record were bringing Nilsson's material to a new or wider audience, but despite the Walkmen playing illustrious venues like the Bait Shop, I'd guess the opposite is happening. The Walkmen's <em>Pussy Cats</em> is for the tiny sliver of the Venn diagram where fans of the original LP and long-established Walkmen fans intersect (and where this writer admittedly rests). The band's faithful recasting is a curio to Nilsson followers, and while it'll stir many fans to sing along, it's in all the same places they've been doing for years.</p><p>
    The story behind Nilsson's original is almost as good as the record: Nilsson was friendly with all the Beatles, but was far closer to (and owed more to) John Lennon than the rest. Nilsson was Lennon's main drinking buddy throughout the ex-Beatle's ""Lost Weekend"" period in L.A., a time when Lennon was separated from Yoko Ono and <em>Pussy Cats</em> came to fruition. When the two finally went into the studio with Lennon as producer, Nilsson's vocal cords ruptured, ruining his impressive higher register for the entirety of the session-- yet he never told Lennon, for fear the project would be halted. It goes to show how Nilsson valued and looked up to his friend,
    but also why he remained a cult figure despite writing huge hits, being loved by esteemed fellow artists
    like the Beatles, and remaining incredibly consistent as a
    songwriter (though the fact this album was originally to be called <em>Strange Pussies</em> is but one example of how Nilsson flouted record company wishes and public regard).</p><p>
    So there's a big reason why the Walkmen are a perfect fit for not just Nilsson, but for this album in particular, and it's not just that Hamilton Leithauser has a talent for sounding like his throat is scorched. The Walkmen cultivate the stubborn, lovable loser segment of Nilsson's persona on a microscale, eschewing structure and expectation from song to song where Nilsson did it album to album-- and we know that the Walkmen are just as capable of writing hits (see ""The Rat"") if they weren't following their own muse wherever it led and just being so goddamned stubborn. I'm a fan of every incidental noise on <em>Bows and Arrows</em>, but the band's (numerous) slow jams always have that last-call weave just as
    this particular record does, and anyone who's seen the Walkmen live know they're not afraid to put in a frazzled performance for the sake of spirit
    , even if they don't quite have the same command of their craft.
    </p><p>
    Or do they? It's funny how they can reproduce the sounds on the original <em>Pussy Cats</em> so accurately, from the strings on ""Many Rivers to Cross"" to the guitar tone in ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"", casting their other records as carefully arranged where they might have sounded vague and unfinished to casual listeners. Funnier that the only track here that sounds like the band themselves (""Black Sails"") isn't even sung by Leithauser, but by Mazarin frontman Quentin Stoltzfus (the writer of ""Another One Goes By"", which the Walkmen cribbed to close <em>A Hundred Miles Off</em>). If I were the type to make assumptions, I'd be tempted to say the boys are having something of an identity crisis this year.
    </p>
<p>
    But I hated ""Many Rivers to Cross"" on first listen and I still do, just as I'm disappointed by ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"". Whether it was personality or just necessity under the circumstances, Nilsson's covers on this record were distinctive; the Walkmen just paint by numbers, despite that the canvas is unlimited. They were within their bounds to record these songs however they wanted, not just how Nilsson did. Ian Svenonius (of Nation of Ulysses, the Make-Up, etc.) shows up to add barely-noticeable backup to ""Subterranean"", though he's more audible on a duet of ""Save the Last Dance"" that sounds like it's being sung through a home karaoke shelf system while he and Leithauser sound appropriately inebriated. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, better they piss all over the source material than the stiff
    reverence of barroom ballads like ""Don't Forget Me"", ""Old Forgotten Soldier"", or even the
    sprightly teetotaler anthem ""All My Life""-- even if the band nails them
    and Leithauser sounds more comfortable here than on much of his band's
    last record. Do they embarrass themselves? Not in the least. But they
    do raise the question of why this album even needs to be heard outside
    the band themselves, and why it should be in stores. The
    accompanying press will encourage letting them off easy by emphasizing
    that it's all in fun, and I'm not saying that's wrong-- I mean, one of
    them is dressed as a piece of fruit on the cover. It's <em>supposed</em> to be a lark, but
    rarely does the gaiety or spontaneity so evident on the original <em>Pussy Cats</em> shine
    through. 
    </p>
<p>
    One exception:
    The album was recorded in the last days of the band's self-owned
    Marcata Studios before being torn down, and the drill sounds that open
    the final cut ""Rock
    Around the Clock"" could be the walls coming down as the band
    races through their last track, tripping over their feet in their final
    minutes of fun. Then, and pretty much <em>only</em> then, does something more than admiration materialize, and the band catches some of the intangible legend floating around Nilsson's output of the <em>Pussy Cats</em> era. Every booze-soaked bad idea is remembered the next day with half-grimace, half-impish grin-- there's always a thrill to know what you got away with that you may not have otherwise. This was all over Nilsson's album, and the Walkmen catch at least a glint of it here.

    Three years after the Rapture invented dancing, most guitar-based music still isn't great to dance to. Each passing wave of post-punk revivalists has tended to excel more at spiky guitars and big hooks than starting new dance crazes. Bands like LCD Soundsystem and TV on the Radio are as fun for their music crit and high-concept harmonies, respectively, as for their rhythms. That's all just another reason why we need Justin Timberlake.</p><p>
    Meanwhile, it's been 17 years since the Happy Mondays and Stone Roses made a city go Mad, and fellow townsfolk Working for a Nuclear City, thankfully, have long memories. Like early Roses or <em>Screamadelica</em>-era Primal Scream, WfaNFC purvey a druggy amalgam of rave, rock, and pop, generous with block-rockin' breakbeats, full-body bass grooves, and crystalline dream-pop comedowns. The blissed-out guitar drones of shoegazers like Slowdive strobe-light the fog-machine air. Throw in vintage Lou Reed and you'd have <em>Trainspotting 2006</em>: <em>Choose Waking Life.</em></p><p>
    Fortunately, the Mancunian quartet's self-titled debut doesn't stop at nostalgia: Like contemporary electro-rockers Caribou, 120 Days, or Fujiya &amp; Miyagi, WfaNFC prove adroit Teutonic disciples for the krautrock throb at the center of kaleidoscopic ""Troubled Son"", while ""Innocence"" pretty much has an anxiety attack at a Chemical Brothers video shoot. Singer/bassist Ed Hulme's deadpan surrealism on ""Dead Fingers Walking"" leads one to wonder why, say, Beck isn't fronting such cocky, cockeyed should-be club anthems. It's psychedelic dance music for a generation that prefers liquor.
    </p>
<p>
    Nor are WfaNFC content to stop at beat-laden soundscapes. The slower four-to-the-floor of synth-chiming ""Quiet Places"" conjures memory reflected in the tranquility of ""a hiding place beneath blue skies,"" gently tugging at old aches. Too-brief ""England"" masks terse radicalism in swooning harmonies. ""Home"" uses ambient noise and scratchy acoustic guitars to elevate a sing-songy bummer into a tiny, poignant miracle, while ""Fallout"" exhales like Air's spaciest, and ""Forever"" veers into a bell-ringing motorik raga. As a whole, the album sounds as good on damp sidewalks as its faster parts would in a dance club.
    </p>
<p>
    Intoxication aside, WfaNFC's debut has nothing in common with the hippies the band's name might imply. In fact, the phrase comes from a sign near Piccadilly Station in Manchester, a ""City of Peace"" that recently celebrated its 25<sup>th</sup> year of, uh, an underworked city council declaring the place a ""nuclear free zone."" Yeah, but what's that in the water? If it's not the bomb, then it's love that will tear us apart.

    In 1960s Phoenix, Mike Lenaburg was a scenester without much of a scene.
    Having grown up in L.A., the white, British-born, r&amp;b-loving Lenaburg was
    used to plenty of musical activity. He was also used to a mixed racial
    environment. Still in his teens when he got a job checking coats at a local
    dance club, he soon graduated to spinning records and talent-spotting for local
    radio DJ and aspiring producer Ray Ford.</p><p>
    Lenaburg believed Phoenix could produce a soul scene every bit as vibrant as
    Detroit or Memphis, and he tried to make that belief a reality. He made his
    first recording with a group called the Newlyweds when he was only 16, and the
    B-side, ""The Quarrel"", became a local novelty hit despite being an
    unlistenable spoken word mess. The guys at Numero Group have included it as the
    last track on their Lenaburg retrospective, the latest in their amazing <em>Eccentric
    Soul</em> series, and it serves as a telling illustration of just how far he had
    come by the time he was regularly helming sessions in the late 60s.</p><p>
    Much of this music was never properly released in its day-- though nearly
    all of it was worthwhile. Lenaburg started and folded several record labels--
    two only saw one release-- and never seemed to find the golden groove that
    could provide a real shape for the Phoenix soul scene the way Motown or Stax
    had for their cities. It's an interesting recorded legacy, though, one full of
    fantastic funk and soul tracks that sound dynamite rubbing up against each
    other on this compilation. 
    </p>
<p>
    Lenaburg's marquee artist was Michael Liggins, who cut a series of filthy
    funk sides in the late-60s, including the merrily lascivious ""Standing on
    the Corner"", a slamming cut in which he and his backing singers wile the
    day away ""standing on the corner watching all the foxes go by.""
    Liggins stuck with Lenaburg even during a long recording hiatus in the 70s (the
    time off came after a singer Lenaburg managed was killed by her husband just
    prior to a tour), and sings the latest track, a beautiful slice of sweet soul
    called ""Black &amp; Beautiful"", based on Little Willie G's
    ""Brown Baby"". 
    </p>
<p>
    There were many more talents hanging around Phoenix, including Chicano soul
    band the Soulsations, represented here by two total stormers: A jerking,
    never-released attempt to jump the shing-a-ling bandwagon called ""Broadway
    Shing-a-Ling"" and ""Funky Nightclub"", a stone dancefloor killer
    with gritty vocals, twisting horns, and clattering, sample-worthy drum break.
    Fourteen-year-old Ronnie Whitehead is present both on his own as a convincing
    James Brown understudy-- ""Cold Feet"" is a blistering answer to
    ""Cold Sweat""-- and as a member of the Soul Blenders, a group formed
    by his brothers. Their ""Blending Soul"" rides a powerhouse groove with
    a fantastic bass line and pounding horn arrangement. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's a shame Lenaburg wasn't able to put together a true company around the
    acts he produced and managed, because this compilation makes clear that not
    only was there a lot of talent in Phoenix, but that Lenaburg himself was
    gifted. He wasn't a performer, but he wrote or co-wrote nearly every song on
    this disc, displaying a deep, spot-on grasp of funk and soul and a willingness
    to experiment. All the talent in the world doesn't matter, though, if all the
    tapes stay in the closet, and it's a true public service that this disc brings
    them out into the light for all to hear.

<em>The Longest Meow</em>
    is the anti-<em>Chinese Democracy</em>. Bobby
    Bare Jr. and his ragtag Young Criminals Starvation League took a mere 11 hours
    to record these 11 tracks (plus a short ambient intro) completely live
    (although he admits to overdubbing a trumpet solo). In honor of this fleet feat
    of phonography, I thought I would write my own review in a mere 11 minutes,
    using only some hastily scribbled notes (""III. Write about the songs.""), a
    kitchen timer, and a 12th minute for fixing typos. I've already started. Nine
    minutes, 44 seconds to go. Um, 41...</p><p>
    So. Is this album any good? That's the central question
    here, isn't it? Answer: More or less. A bit laborious at times, especially
    toward the end, but it can be charming in an amiably shaggy sort of way, much
    like the photo of Bare Jr. in the album sleeve. He's armed with his alternately
    incisive and ignorable lyrics, his typically drawling voice, and a motley crew
    of backing musicians and hangers-on (Eleven in all. Numerologists?) that include
    members of My Morning Jacket, Trail of Dead, Lambchop, and Clem Snide. 7:22.</p><p>
    Anyway. After the 30-second instrumental opener (which
    apparently doesn't count toward the tracklist total), ""The Heart Bionic"" is
    BJr. in fine form, indulging his eccentricities as a lyricist, melodicist, and
    vocalist. It tells of living with a bionic heart. I'd quote some lyrics to that
    effect, but no time. He obviously savors the constraints of the project and the
    rascally resourcefulness they inspire in the music. It's like Sam Raimi
    directing <em>Evil Dead</em>; he's forced to
    be more creative, which sparks these songs to life. ""Back to Blue"" is a Latin-flavored
    strummer that highlights BJr's hangdog vocals, and the sweeping C&amp;W lament
    ""Demon Valley"",
    punctuated by his unexpected mouth pops, recall Bare Sr.'s gentle balladry. If
    the time limitations inform the album's sound, so too do the 11 musicians. BJr
    finds surprising ways to work them all in. 
    Everyone sings the big wordless chorus of ""Uh Wuh Oh"" as if compensating
    for a fuller rock sound, and uncredited voices provide the honks and beeps for the
    homegrown bossa nova of ""Sticky Chemical"".  If nothing else, it sounds like the recording
    limitations inspired considerable studio comraderie and hijinks. 4:20...
    </p>
<p>
    Ummm...3:50...
    </p>
<p>
    The Pixies cover is okay.
    </p>
<p>
    3:07
    </p>
<p>
    Some songs sound like hastily scribbled sketches, obviously
    disadvantaged by the lack of time. There's not much between the shouted
    choruses of ""Uh Wuh Oh"" to justify the song. Same with ""Snuggling World
    Championships"", which sounds like a My Morning Jacket outtake (and actually
    features two members of that band). 2:19...
    </p>
<p>
    Oh. The type of music that BJr practices-- informed as much by
    his father's cohorts as by his
    post-alt-country-shut-the-fuck-up-I-know-it's-just-a-meaningless-label
    contemporaries-- thrives on the feel of live spontaneity, the electric dynamic
    between drums, bass, guitars, and vocals that reflects the rambunctiousness of
    honkytonks and cramped clubs of rock's past. BJr's always been careful to try
    to preserve this unruliness in his music, which means that<em> The Longest Meow</em> is no drastic departure from his previous work. In
    fact, it makes certain songs sound like he's trying too hard to come off as
    either oddball or off-the-cuff. He obviously doesn't need the stunts: The same

    It's been a long time since the Prodigy's Liam Howlett
    took the sound of a glass bottle shattering and used it as part of one of his
    percussion tracks, since house music aimed for a certain frantic, bleary-eyed
    abandon. Over the past decade and a half, house has grown increasingly pretty
    and genteel, more concerned with space and melody than furious fucked-up drive.
    Michael Mayer and Dominik Eulberg and Ricardo Villalobos make a lot of pretty
    noises, but not all of us have the attention span to absorb their slowly
    unfolding shimmers; it's too much Terry Riley, not enough Teddy Riley.</p><p>
    For those of us who never got sick of the pitched-up
    hedonism of hardcore rave, ""Waters of Nazareth"" is exactly what we've
    been missing. The first single from Justice, a pair of French remixers
    affiliated with the fashionably coked-up Paris label Ed Banger, ""Waters of
    Nazareth"" is the sort of hammering destructo-blast that we thought
    Europeans had forgotten how to make. The track starts with a distorted,
    flanged-out synth riff and a stomping house beat that sounds like it's being
    pounded on upside-down oil-drums. The base elements are noisy and fucked, but
    the track's construction is classic house, and it would sound pretty and florid
    if they'd played the riff on pianos instead of dying synths. ""Waters of
    Nazareth"" moves with a sort of desperate, claustrophobic lurch-- there's
    no empty space anywhere-- but it still builds and unfolds on its own schedule.
    Halfway through, a mournful organ sighs into the track and gives it a
    melancholy lift, but the rip-snorting heaviness is what'll stick with you.</p><p>
    ""Waters of Nazareth"" sounds like the sort of
    burning megaton volley you might build a movement from, but Justice can't even
    keep its momentum through this six-song record, and that's a problem. The EP
    only has two other originals, and neither shares the title track's bruising force.
    ""Let There Be Light (Demo)"" is a lesser sequel: same unrelenting
    drums and squeaky, ugly synth noises with none of the slamming immediacy. And
    ""Carpates"" is a deeply unpleasant IDM misstep with an annoying repetitive bass bounce and a clicky, sidelong drum track. Both feel weirdly
    undercooked, like the duo just couldn't manage another furious dance banger and
    instead ground out a couple tracks to pad the release.
    </p>
<p>
    The second half of the EP is all remixes: two of
    ""Waters of Nazareth"", one of ""Let There Be Light"". The
    Justice remix of ""Waters of Nazareth"" is a mess; they tweak the drums
    and chop up the synth riff just enough to take all the propulsive power away
    from both. And Erol Alkan's re-edit is pretty much just the original track with
    a stretched-out, delayed-gratification intro. It's DJ Funk's remix of ""Let
    There Be Light"" that saves the EP's back half, mostly because he
    throws away the original track, replacing it with a great clipped ghetto-tech
    bass riff and a chopped-up ""bounce that ass"" chant, leading to controlled
    Miami bass insanity. Let's hope Justice is taking notes.

    This isn't the first time Bright Eyes has released an album of time-capsuled errata. 2000's <em>A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995-1997</em> gathered up the grainy juvenilia predating his debut album, 1998's <em>Letting Off the Happiness</em>. It found the young Oberst sowing the bitter seeds he would raise to a dark crop on 2000's pivotal <em>Fevers and Mirrors</em>-- his last truly hermetic album, before the sociopolitical world came rushing in-- only to burn the harvest and start from scratch with forays into trad country and digital pop on subsequent albums.</p><p>
    Confined to a shorter time period than <em>Noise Floor</em>, in which Oberst was just establishing his perennial motifs-- fevers, dreams, mirrors, calendars, wine, women, medication, entrapment, stasis, and fate-- <em>Collection</em> was fairly homogenous. But <em>Noise Floor</em>'s B-sides, singles, compilation tracks, and sundry rarities span a period of extended transition for Oberst. While the album isn't arranged chronologically, listening to it as such reveals the series of intuitive leaps between lo-fi bedroom folk that emphasized monotonous gloom and cacophonous samples to comparatively laid-back country biased toward majestic arrangements and electronic beats.</p><p>
    The earliest entries favor naked dirges and apolitical self-pity, privileging immediacy over polish. 1999's ""The Vanishing Act"" is a gray blur of rickety acoustic guitar and discordant piano on which Oberst wallows in the well of despair with the romantic relish of someone who's yet to reach its bottom. 2000's ""Soon You Will Be Leaving Your Man"" upgrades to a fluid, reverbed guitar pulse, but retains the breathy and almost tuneless vocals Oberst favored in that era, as well as his shorthand for authenticity-- palpably twanging strings, accidental harmonics, and ambient crowd chatter. 2000's ""Mirrors and Fevers"", which is two full minutes of crowd noise followed by one minute of a capella singing, isn't much of a song, but it works as an album opener-- Oberst's trapped-under-ice imagery and musings on inevitability handily establish the album's mise en scène. 
    </p>
<p>
    But as early as 2001's excellent ""I Will Be Grateful for This Day"", we can detect a shift in Oberst's songwriting. With its melting vocal line, staticky mechanical drums, and humming synths, the song predicts <em>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</em>, yet doesn't bog down in pretensions as that album sometimes does. Not musically, anyway-- Oberst's lyrics always tread the thin line between sublimely maudlin and banally maudlin; ""Grateful"" subjects us to the latter with a protracted metaphor about trying to play someone's heartbeat on the drums. 2001 doesn't appear to have been a great creative year for Oberst-- ""Bad Blood"", co-written with the Album Leaf's Jimmy LaValle, is so thin and inessential. The quavering vocals and barely intimated chord shapes of ""I've Been Eating (For You)"" are promising enough until one listens to the lyrics, which plumb unintentionally comical depths of self-obsession and strained metaphor, with a ridiculous girl-as-basketball metaphor. ""Happy Birthday to Me (Feb. 15)"" is much better, with its woozy slides and twinkling piano, not to mention the emphatic swearing, spontaneous shouting, and nauseous vibrato Oberst was already starting to phase out for the more mannered urgencies of <em>Lifted </em>and beyond.  
    </p>
<p>
    It's exactly these kinds of emotionally febrile outbursts that Bright Eyes detractors hate, and they continue to flare up even amid more recent, polemical songs, like 2003's jangly ""Trees Get Wheeled Away"" and the ragged sing-along ""Drunk Kid Catholic"". Yet the same affectations that repel some are what makes this music speak to so many. To embrace Bright Eyes, it helps to have friends with whom playing music is just the emulsion of your mutual love, or to intuit and long for this experience, which always sounds trite, with an uncool hippie-ish quality, until you're the one joyously banging out a chord on an acoustic guitar. Maybe this self-indulgent spontaneity doesn't translate to tape if you aren't predisposed to appreciate it. Fair enough. But it's precisely what makes Bright Eyes fans overlook  his excesses and missteps, this sense of being a part of a special moment governed more by intuition than intellect. And for better or worse (better if you think this stuff about love and special moments sounds silly, worse if you don't), it's what is diminishing as Oberst's music accumulates polish and orchestral weight.

    Consolidation in the music industry has created problems that have manifested themselves both in business and
    art, but one of the positive side effects of it is on display on <em>What It Is!</em>, the latest in Rhino's
    campaign to collate the sidelines of music history with four-disc boxed sets. The
    subtitle of the box notes that all of the (mostly) obscure funk and soul sides
    in the tracklist comes from the vaults of just three labels: Atlantic,
    Atco, and Warner Brothers. Reading the exhaustive track notes, however, reveals
    a huge list of original issuing labels, including Keymen, Josie, Reprise,
    Cotillion, Alston, and Kwanza, all of which were either scooped up in
    acquisitions or distributed by the three title labels, which of course are all
    owned by the same company today.</p><p>
    It's rather nice to have one, well-documented place to go
    for such a huge range of funk and soul tracks, and Rhino has taken advantage of
    it, consolidating things even further to compile what amounts to, as Oliver
    Wang says in his lead-in essay, a ""shadow history of funk."" These aren't the
    songs that blew up the charts, though you may have heard a few of them-- Curtis
    Mayfield's ""(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below We're All Gonna Go"" or Wilson
    Pickett's ""Engine Number 9"", for instance.</p><p>
    Though the title puts the range of years at 1967-1977, the
    vast majority of the songs gathered here came out in the first five years of
    that span. They're arranged chronologically, and you don't get to 1973 until
    the sixth track of Disc 4. This is entirely appropriate, because the real
    window of dirty, nasty funk-- before it gave way to disco and other, smoother
    cousins-- was a relatively short one. Several of the later tracks don't quite fit
    the spirit of what precedes them, and there's a lot of distance between the
    simple bounce of organ epiphany on the Watts 103<sup>rd</sup> Street
    Rhythm Band's ""Spreadin' Honey"", released in 1967, and the cosmic, synth-heavy
    stomp of ""Riding High"", recorded in 1977 by the Ohio Players under the name
    Faze-O. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are names that pop up throughout the generous track
    notes, and two of the most common are the twin giants of New Orleans r&amp;b, Allen Toussaint and the
    Meters, who often worked as Toussaint's house band. Both are represented with
    their own tracks, but Toussaint penned a further seven, and at least a couple
    of Meters turn up on six tracks credited to other artists. The best of these is
    a full-on Meters romp, Cyrille Neville's 1970 killer ""Gossip"". The song opens
    with a towering ""coral sitar"" guitar riff from Leo Nocentelli that injects a
    heavy dose of psychedelia to accent the rock-hard beat.
    </p>
<p>
    A few tracks later, you get a real sitar, courtesy of Ananda
    Shankar's cover of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"". Shankar was nephew to Ravi, and sold a truckload of LPs grafting virtuoso sitar
    playing onto psychedelic pop; ""Metamorphosis"" is the
    funkiest track from his self-titled LP, but ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" is more
    immediate. On the less frivolous end of things is ""Headless Heroes"" by Eugene
    McDaniels, from his political funk opus <em>Headless
    Heroes of the Apocalypse</em>, a record Spiro Agnew personally requested be
    withdrawn in spite of the fact that almost nobody heard it. When McDaniels
    refers to us all as ""racial pawns in the master game"" and asserts that ""the
    player who controls the board sees them all as the same/ Basically cannon
    fodder,"" you know he means it.
    </p>
<p>
    Paranoia rears its head on the dark funk of Baby Huey &amp;
    the Babysitters' ""Hard Times"", an icy ghetto soul track with a chilling,
    guitar-soaked intro and lyrics about being held up by someone you thought you
    trusted. Baby Huey is one of many artists here worth investigating further-- including the
    Meters, Curtis Mayfield, Wilson Pickett, Harlem River Drive, Mongo Santamaria,
    Fred Wesley, King Curtis, and Bobby Byrd. There are, however, a number of artists for whom further
    investigation is damn near impossible. More than a quarter of the bands included
    here never released a full-length album, so the Houseguests' ""What So Never the
    Dance"" is pretty much it. This is where the value of a set like this really
    comes into sharp relief-- Tony Alvon &amp; the Belairs' groover ""Sexy Coffee Pot""
    has never been easier to come by than it is with this on the shelves.
    </p>
<p>
    Some of the curiosities don't pan out like you might
    expect-- Sly Stone's ""I'm Just Like You"", cut during the sessions for <em>There's a Riot Goin' On</em> and released
    under the name 6ix on Stone Flower, is muddy and you can hear the toll all the
    drugs were taking. Others, however,
    deliver like gangbusters: The early Earth, Wind &amp; Fire instrumental ""Hot
    Tune"" is a blazing slab of hard funk, spiked with African thumb piano and
    monstrous fuzz bass. A clutch of Latin funk tracks, including Mongo
    Santamaria's version of the Temptations' ""I Can't Get Next to You"", Harlem River Drive's
    breakneck ""Seeds of Life"", and Malo's ultra-smooth ""Suavecito"" makes the case
    that a box of nothing but Latin funk could be extremely rewarding on its own. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>What It Is!</em> is a
    thoroughly enjoyable set, and it covers a lot of ground, from political
    agitation to the pure party groove of the Bar-Kays' ""Soul Finger"". In spite of
    drawing only from the vaults of three major labels, it's a great introduction
    to funk for a newcomer looking for a taste and some arrows pointing down roads
    of further investigation. It's hard to imagine hearing the Beginning of the
    End's ""Funky Nassau (Part II)"" for the first time and not wanting to shout for
    joy or just get up and dance, and this box offers that thrill to the
    uninitiated 91 times.

As a remixer and producer, he condensed every strand of pop and soul, linking r&amp;b's irresistible romance to rock's drunken savagery. His best singles are volatile compounds of sex-starved vocals, ice-rolling synths, imperious bass lines, and rhythms that alternate between narcoleptic stupor and powdered giddiness. As the unofficial inventor of the disco 12"", he was responsible for converting trifling club hits into epic swells of percussive bliss, and his invention of the ""disco break"" means that his work-- more than nearly any other disco producer's-- acted as the fundament for hip-hop, new wave, and house. Moulton's mixes represent the sound of disco as it was transmitted through DJs and samplists to the modern day: pop vocals spun into never-ending networks of quivering funk. The elementary structure of your average Moulton mix will therefore be familiar to anyone with a strobe light, but the complexity and elegance is nearly overwhelming throughout Soul Jazz's two-disc set.</p><p>
    Moulton's name was nearly synonymous with disco success and his direct influence spreads across thousands of records. It would be impossible to catalogue that career in a handful of cuts, and this compilation hardly concerns itself with that ambition. It's less of an anthology than an appetizer. Not that it matters, since nearly every song overflows with intoxicated energy. Eddie Kendricks' ""Keep on Truckin'"" establishes Moulton's modus operandi: blaring horns, strutting bass, frothing doo-wop, and cooing voices lined with synthesized silk. With orchestral trembles and cymbal-and-tympani breaks, it sounds like 11 minutes of pure culmination, inaugurating every disco cliché without sacrificing its salacious grace. B.T. Express' ""Peace Pipe"" has nothing to do with peace and everything to do with snow-snorting fury: Its serene strings give way to a convoluted arrangement of electric flutes, cracking funk, and gun-crazy back-up vocalists. Elsewhere, sly espionage themes and soft Brazilian bossa nova absorb the shock of the percussion on Patti Jo's ""Make Me Believe in You."" A sort of rhythmic epilepsy disorients the steely vocals and seductive allure of Camouflage's ""You've Got the Power"", as though the drummer kept getting knocked unconscious. The result is a manic assemblage of drummed detonations.</p><p>
    Generally, this makes for brash, flamboyant disco. But as Moulton's mixes got progressively more epic, he ably introduced elements that would influence everything from electro-pop to Detroit techno. Witness Orlando Riva Sound's ""Moonboots"": subterranean bubbles and pulsations, wiry synths, and fulminating guitar shimmers. Like his famous mix of the Andrea True Connection's  ""More More More"", it's the aural equivalent of Vegas neon. The best track is probably Don Downing's ""Dreamworld"", an uncanny ode to claustrophobia and paranoid love. Downing hyperventilates, the strings slice like daggers, and the sweltering percussion gets more and more funereal. It's a heavily nuanced song for a genre that's often unfairly associated with numbed euphoria or crass monotony. But Moulton's principal virtue was to expand ephemeral pop songs into caterwauling cycles of elation and rhythm. Regardless of your penchant for extended breaks, this is simply some of the most electrifying music of the 1970s.</p></div>"|9536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9536-a-tom-moulton-mix/|8.7|Alex Linhardt

    survivors hoarding an energy source, we encounter a new band sporting
    Go4 and Wire touchstones and impulsively proceed to blow its head off
    rather than risk checking out their MySpace page and unknowingly fall
    for another French Kicks. Shameful? Maybe, but admittedly so, I didn't
    hesitate to reach for my shotgun before listening to the debut LP from
    Britain's the Young Knives.</p><p>
    Festooned with the usual post-punk accoutrements, there's little
    dancing around the fact these guys posture as rank and file
    revivalists, especially when frontman Henry Dartnall's vocals ape Colin
    Newman's down to every inflection and hyperventilated yelp. However,
    while most of today's bands claiming such influences cash out by
    framing angular guitars and start-stop rhythms in tried/true pop
    structures, the Knives remain determined to keep everything too
    complicated for modern rock radio. Even at their catchiest and sexiest on single
    ""Weekends and Bleak Days (Hot Summer)"", the bacchanalia feels both
    mathematical and unpredictable, like pop run through a random number
    generator.</p><p>
    While <em>Voices of Animals And Men</em> boasts a lot of artiness for
    artiness' sake, performative intellectualism meets cavalier looseness
    on the record to form a heady but entertaining shindig; think of a Wire
    cover band playing at a wedding. Opener ""Part Timer"" tempers an
    uptight, fidgety verse-chorus progression with an asinine breakdown
    centered around an amateurish bass slide. Likewise, ""Here Comes the
    Rumour Mill"" minds its p's and q's, meticulously working its way
    through sinuous guitar parts before face-planting on a beer-guzzling,
    power-pop chorus. When the party stops, slower numbers like ""Tailors""
    showcase the band's mettle at crafting proto-emo lullabies with
    Television Personalities' goofy, ""Cor blimey!"" charm.</p><p>
    Eventually on <em>Animals and Men</em> the Knives' ""cool"" genius shtick
    wears a little thin, leaving them sounding a lot like the garden
    variety revivalist fodder that's usually shunned. If the ideas aren't
    coming effusively, such as on ""In the Pink"" and ""Mystic Energy"", the
    band devolves into plodding, droll Brit-pop. On the other hand,
    over-thinking their post-punk formulas leads to avant-garde upchuck
    like ""She's Attracted To"", which features the forgettable Good
    Charlotte-meets-Johnny Rotten spoken word ""Who are these people?/ They
    are too stupid to be your real parents!"" Fortunately <em>Animals and Men</em>
    manages to toe the line between these two extremes for three-fourths of
    its duration. Despite offering completely nothing new to the genre, the
    Knives apply the more-than-one-way-to-eat-a-Reese's strategy to their
    post-punk dalliances, creating relatively unpredictable art in an
    otherwise all-too-familiar framework. <br/></p></div>"|9490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9490-voices-of-animals-and-men/|7.3|Adam Moerder

    The Curtains have gone from zygotes
    to embryos. But no sex organs yet-- Chris Cohen, the band's only permanent
    member, shares the seasick,
    stop-and-go pop and guileless, virginal voice of Asthmatic Kitty
    label mates Half-Handed Cloud, Shapes and Sizes, and Sufjan Stevens.
    In the Curtains' press photos, Cohen strikes a shy pose, shoulders curled in, with his eyes unable
    to lock with the camera's-- hand him a banjo and it's one of Stevens'
    press photos. Cohen left Deerhoof after they released <em>The Runners
    Four</em>, the band's best album, and a record with his fingerprints
    all over it. It wasn't bitter-- the band released an EP of
    covers to commemorate his departure<span style=""font-weight: bold""></span>. It just took three albums to make the Curtains
    Cohen's own.</p><p>
    The Curtains have three previous albums that each
    sound less focused than <em>Calamity</em>. <em>Flybys</em> (2003) and <em>Vehicles of Travel</em> (2004) were recorded with different musicians (including
    Deerhoof's Greg Saunier and Satomi Matsuzaki) and consist mostly of
    song fragments. Taken in order, these albums sound like childhood,
    the band's wordless fragments growing into talking, feeling songs,
    able to hold their heads up on their own. Still, Cohen works with fewer words than a Stevens song title. He writes with fewer
    instruments too-- each song uses Cohen's compressed guitar sound,
    piano, drums, and little else. Still, Cohen plants sounds of the 60s
    and 70s all over <em>Calamity</em>. ""Go Lucky""'s piano chords
    may sound like a reference of a reference (Cat Power's ""The
    Greatest""). But ""Green Water's"" palm-muted bass and
    clean lead guitar invoke the Who, while ""Brunswick Stew""'s
    tricky little beat is <em>On the Corner</em>-era Miles Davis.</p><p>
    Cohen's
    ribbon-thin voice sounds naïve but keeps a sort of experienced
    acceptance. ""Don't try to follow me now/ Green water swallow me
    up,"" goes ""Green Water""'s determined chorus, repeated
    over staccato guitar down strokes. He sings ""I'll float
    above,"" stretching the word ""above"" higher and higher, as if it
    were a performative (the equivalent of Superman's ""up, up, and
    away!""). But then the word's melody sinks down again; he's
    gone.  
    </p>
<p>
    The empty spaces let the listener in on Cohen's process.
    <em>Calamity</em> looks like mere outlines of what Deerhoof does, but
    sink below and, well, it's not so much ""look at the negative
    space"" or ""it's the notes he's <em>not</em> playing, maaaan"" as
    seeing that each song's so delicate, each horn line or piano tinkle
    so deliberately placed, that pulling one away would make it collapse.
    The simplicity does get simplistic at times. ""World's Most
    Dangerous Women"" could have doubled its chords to a solid four,
    so Cohen wouldn't need to fill the space with tuneless vocals. Half
    the song's arrangements are too malleable and accommodating, and need
    a firm slap on the rump to save them from innocuousness. Growing
    pains, though. <em>Calamity</em> shows Cohen struggling to balance his
    twee pop tendencies with experimentation, the same thing Deerhoof
    mastered on <em>The Runners Four.</em> On <em>Calamity</em>, he's

How I hate it. How I hate stepping out the door only to come back sweaty, vaguely pissed off, and not much more in shape. It's not that I don't have the gear: running shoes, iPod, neutral tee, the wherewithal to notice girls while praying the finish line was just a little closer. However, even with an array of devices and strategies, everyone knows that working out only works if you, uh, work. In short, there's no easy way out of stretching, running for half an hour, and stretching some more. I've heard it's all about your attitude. I also read somewhere that I should ""just do it,"" but frankly, that always seemed like borderline-sarcastic taunting.</p><p>
    And now that LCD Soundsystem have sold out to the greatest American shoe company ever to co-opt popular culture, I really have no excuse. Okay, ""sold out"" is harsh, especially considering Nike's advertising and marketing track record: 1987's ""Revolution"" spot by Portland-based ad tycoons Wieden &amp; Kennedy (who'd also worked with Lou Reed for Honda), the ""Bo Knows"" campaign of the late 80s, Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon wondering how MJ put so much height into his jump (""must be the shoes"")-- at this point, they're less stealing from pop culture than contributing to it. And it doesn't hurt that these campaigns were wildly successful, so if James Murphy and company can condescend to the corporate ranks, far be it from me to cry foul.</p><p>
    Put simply, ""45:33"" (would that John Cage needed to shed those unsightly post-Columbus Day lbs.) is an original workout mix by LCDS. Commissioned by Nike and available at iTunes, the piece is purportedly based on ""an arc designed for running,"" featuring new music by the band, pieced together like a DJ mix in a fashion that's apparently supposed to help me forget I'm hating life on the jogging trail. And somehow, it almost manages to do that. After taking it on a test run, I can attest that the music really does move forward similarly to my own metabolism, gradually building, holding a modest climax in the middle, and ending on a long, fluffy comedown. None of the music really qualifies as ""songs,"" as there isn't much in the way of lyrics or big hooks beyond unobtrusive chants like ""shame on you"" or ""no fun in space""-- though, as I see it, that's a plus for a running mix. There's nothing like being bogged down by music that demands too much attention while you're trying to exercise.
    </p><p>
    Things begin slowly with an unassuming analog synth line that gradually speeds up and introduces a hyper-tasteful, jazzy house piano line. A few minutes of building morphs the tune into DFA-flavored soft disco-rock, with Murphy's pronouncements, ""You can't hide... your love away from me! Hey!"" Subtly, the track is peppered with tambourine and a little extra kickdrum, and further morphs into a section I call ""treadmill disco,"" crossing kinetic motorik and what sounds like the mechanical wheeze of exercise machines. When the bells enter with the melody, I start to wonder when this is going to be fleshed out for a new LCDS 12"". That goes double for the following section, wherein Murphy opts for mid-tempo disco-funk (a la the first part of ""Yeah""), eventually adding horns and the ""no fun in space"" refrain.
    </p>
<p>
    Things really take off at about the 28:30 mark with a horn break, and fast, glittery disco-rock that **PAGING DFA PRODUCTIONS** really should be expanded into a single. The cutting bassline and relentless, stone-faced pulse are almost perfectly tailored for the most active part of a workout-- although, even if you wouldn't come within a mile of a jogging trail on a bet, the hi-NRG is tough to deny. In fact, just when you might be ready for extra oxygen and an IV, the bottom falls into the first of two (!) cool-down sections, beginning with the ""shimmering, harmonious tinkerbell cooing"" section, followed by the merely ""harmonious cooing"" part. It's debatable whether or not a mixtape should be 20% comprised of the comedown, but then again, Nike is a big company: Never underestimate the unfit nature of the American consumer. In any case, my trial run ended with me all in one piece, and a lot of this music still in my head. Nice mix.

Sure, warm nostalgic fuzzies could be had with a track like ""I'm in Love (With Arthur Dove)"",  with its Superchunky chorus lead-in, or the castigation of certain fuckers in ""You Blanks"".  In light of the other seven tracks on this album, however, these minor capitulations to the rock seem like bones thrown to a certain sect of fans waiting for Superchunk to go from sporadic touring unit to fully functional music-producing outfit.  It's been over five years since those folks had something new to do the standing still to.  If Portastatic keeps this up, it might be prudent to make the hiatus permanent.</p><p>
<em>Be Still Please</em> does a fine job of ignoring the title's polite suggestion.  It's an album that shows McCaughan &amp; co. pushing forward, building on both the previous album (Portastatic's first as an official group) and Mac's film soundtrack work.  Strings and woodwinds abound, and are fitting accoutrements to McCaughan's songs.  It's a telling sign that the orchestrations that once stuck out clumsily in his work now feel like integral parts of his songs.  They sweeten the album's lead-off track, ""Sour Shores"", and, in conjunction with Laura Cantrell's back-up vocals, lend a tasteful melancholy to ""Black Buttons"".  As noted before, it's the rockier tracks that stick out.  Every time a electric guitar solo comes out, or the drummer decides to get his money's worth out of his kit, it sounds awkward and out of place.</p><p>
    A more flattering sound for the group is the smooth bossa nova sway of ""Sweetness and Light"", which features McCaughan turning his lyrical acuity on his own well-documented vocal shortcomings:  ""I know my voice is like a broken saw/ I know my voice is like a sickly shrew.""  He doesn't let this stop him from getting all he can out of his pipes.  On ""Black Buttons"", he sounds quite similar the late Grant McLennen of the Go-Betweens, with Cantrell's voice serving as the perfect stand-in for Amanda Brown's.  For ""Getting Saved"", he wears his appreciation for Eric Bachmann's Neil Diamond idolatry with raspy pride.  It's a pride he's earned.  McCaughan's confidence, in his talents and his songs, is readily apparent throughout this album, and the result is his best non-Superchunk work to date.

    neo-folk's increasingly freak-fashion landscape (remember grunge
    wear?). Part of the magic: It seems just about effortless. To place the aesthetic
    within a contemporary constellation, find the Jewelled Antler-league trio
    somewhere between Ben Chasny's <em>Compathia </em>lullabies, the streaked tape wobble of Jakob Olausson's <em>Moonlight Farm</em>, or Jana Hunter's patchwork ambience. All those things, but with less roaming and fewer brambles.</p><p>
    Jewelled Antler mainstay Glenn Donaldson's
    part of the equation, and you can't generally go wrong with one of his projects. The California disciple's always skulking somewhere near JA's margins,
    including his holy-sounding solo work as the Birdtree and the Ivytree along
    with multi-person projects like
    Blithe Sons, the Franciscan Hobbies, Mirza, Skygreen Leopards, and Thuja.</p><p>
    The Antler résumé's carted out again (printed on tree bark with sap) because-- like his recent guest-spot on Wooden Wand's <em>Second Attention</em>-- in Flying
    Canyon, despite the acid-folk pedigree, Donaldson lets someone else take lead. For this outing, he rests in a shadowy self-made bed of drums, organ, banjo, flute, and
    acid-folk falsetto. He's joined by newest Skygreen Leopard (and
    fellow <em>Second Attention</em>
    guest) Shayde
    Sartin on bass and acoustic guitar and long-standing Leopard Donovan Quinn, aka sleepy nighttime magician
    Verdure, who plays slide guitar on a track. So basically, the Skygreen
    Leopard squad's gathered in silence, allowing sweetly grizzled Cayce Lindner to float atop the
    reverb sea.
    </p><p>
    Everyone's excellent, but Lindner steals the show with gentle, lonesome
    vocals that linger like a blend of Roky Erickson's solo work (sans twang), Skip Spence's
    throat-scratched submersion, and David Crosby's California
    dusk melody-- note the album cover's similarity to Crosby's first solo
    album, 1971's <em>If I Could Only Remember My Name</em>. Conjuring that era, I'd love to hear
    him duet with White Magic's Mira Billotte, as Grace Slick, of course. People have also mentioned Kris Kristofferson, but KK was one suave dude--
    Lindner might be suave in a Daniel Higgs way, but he doesn't sing with Kristofferson's swagger or, for that matter, Higgs' solo work's possessed folk incanting. His vocals are tangibly sadder (without
    being mopey). Unlike some downer folkies, he doesn't whisper-- his voice is rich and he always opens
    up and sings, sometimes taking it as far as his vocal chords can rattle before cracking.
    </p>
<p>
    Not merely a bounteously bearded fromman, he also writes the memorable, refreshingly
    raga-free songs. This is unadorned but fathomless music. I like the idea of the reunited Saint Vitus hooking up with Vashti Bunyan, but the ""California doom folk"" tag that comes attached to
    the jewel box is a tad misleading. No doubt the music's slow and gloomy, but heavy? There are unexpected
    drum or bass sounds, but the sound remains spectral and spare. The doomiest track is the opener,
    ""In the Reflection"", which ponders ""the stars' forgotten glow,"" while sonically perched atop deep-dish/detuned echo drums, lethargic Mudhoney
    bass (set to three on an amplifier), and seraphic guitar. When the
    bottom drops out, you feel it leave, but no more than you would a
    butterfly flapping its wings (and no, not the butterfly-effect butterfly).
    </p>
<p>
    Flying Canyon are less forest floor miasmatic than other Jewelled
    Antler offerings. The nine songs reintroduce the emotions and
    atmospherics of Donaldson's earlier work, but from within a cigarette-burnt Motel 6, not the branches of a warbling shade tree. Recorded on reel-to-reel by
    Donaldson-- you can feel the moss, dust, and despair growing on the side of his
    tape machine-- the set's paced at a dazed half-speed (this is where that doom thing sorta comes into play).
    Songs feel like culled, breathless fragments. Most seem to
    take place at night-- bodies give out (or exist as diamond mines), windows frame half-remembered experiences, harmonies end at dawn, people leave and turn away, it consistently rains.  
    </p>
<p>
    The sooty atmospherics aren't built by accrued
    layering, but rather the spacious, intimately claustrophobic shag-rug feel of the room-- the way those
    early Scud Mountain Boys albums were recorded in a kitchen,
    around a table. But then, the dewy ""The Bull Who Knew the Ring"" is a lonesome
    prairie stride up the side of a mountain range. As with other
    songs, it could ostensibly creep for 30 minutes: Skip Spence's <em>Oar</em> left to disintegrate in a cedar lake (count the rings).   
    </p>
<p>
    These
    days, psychedelic window dressing, PR-hatched
    mythologies, and six thousand and one new folk reissues a week are beyond
    tired. In fact, even the musicians often associated with the scene are <u><a href=""http://billboard.blogs.com/jadedinsider/2006/10/she_is_not_afra.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">working overtime to distance themselves frome the henna-dripping trainwreck</a></u>. Flying
    Canyon's complexly understated sound, which reveals new textures and resonances with each listen,  exists outside the cloying, faux-folk context: Behind weepy
    organ, cabinet hums, a surprising drum shivver, Lindner and friends
    carve out an erudite haze that foregoes caricature and
    wardrobe changes in favor of melody, inventive instrumentation, strong songwriting, and an honest, riveting charisma. Pretty novel, right?

    Martin Dosh is an unabashed sentimentalist. It's rumored
    that he sealed the deal with his future wife, Erin, by writing a song called ""I
    Think I'm Getting Married"". His only proper EP is named for his son,
    Naoise, and its closing track-- a tripping, delicate aubade riding a playfully
    broken beat teased out by xylophone twinkles and turntable snips-- is ""Happy Song
    for Tadgh"", a dedication to his half-brother. Dosh isn't afraid to make his
    music personal, and-- given his mix of organ, piano, loops, and live drums,
    stacked into major keys and manifest moods-- he wants it to be taken that way,
    too.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    To wit, if most modern electronic music seems frustrating
    because it appears intent only on either providing pelvic-thrust compulsion or
    verifying its theoretical ballast, Dosh is your man. He hints at house's pulse
    builds on decades of work from previous abstracters, but, more importantly he
    wears his heart on his beats. At last, he's made an album-- <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Lost Take</span><span>-- that's worthy of such sincere and
    intimate affections and communicates them with consistent clarity. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Expressed on record, Dosh's life resembles his utopia, even
    if it's busy, restless, and sometimes marred by the difficulties of being an
    active musician with a family: Here, Dosh is an enthusiastic cheerleader, a guy
    who wants to be known for a happy family, a load of friends, and his role in
    both. The music is cause <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">and</span><span> effect.
    ""Everybody Cheer Up Song""-- the album's slowest, saddest track, purposely dimmed
    with keyboards resisting resolution and motionless guitars trying to goad
    Dosh's directionless drumming home-- is followed by ""Um, Circles and Squares"",
    one of the album's brightest moments. Andrew Bird's doleful violin is the
    invocation, but Dosh doubles it on itself, subsuming it with a high-attack
    Rhodes sequence. Bird's strings peek through only to be swatted with cymbals
    and snares, a frown flipped, then forgotten. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Lost Take </span><span>is
    Dosh's most thematically functional release to date, using alternating
    textures-- from John Fahey-inspired picking to winsome steel guitar-- and
    structures, from passages shaped by noise to tunes built on perfect scales, for
    near-circadian mimesis. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""></span><span>""A
    Ghost's Business"", for instance, is kinetic in every sense: With synthesizer
    sequences and chopped bits of Bird's violin scrambling above and beneath, Dosh
    ultimately seeks solace in a drum run that-- racing itself, </span><em><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">ad
    nauseam</span></em><span>-- offers its practitioner no comfort.
    But he sounds busy, not nervous, and his choice to follow it with the gorgeous ""Ship
    Wreck"" restores the balance. Just 20 seconds in, Erin reads a poem-- ""There is
    color, deeper than itself, what it forms""-- and the tune of her words rescues the
    track from a thin cusp of static and noise. Just as the melody builds, Dosh's voice
    (which makes its debut on this album) rises and meets it, singing ""Matter feels
    deeper than its hardness/ The space it takes/ Beyond space I see a plane that
    multiplies itself."" It's an endearing instant, a momentary glimpse into Dosh's
    very real microcosm.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Not coincidentally, Dosh's best-sounding and most thoroughly
    composed album yet draws capably from that same sphere. Known alternately for
    drumming with Fog, backing Andrew Bird, and bussing beats to anyone who
    wants to collaborate, Dosh gives <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Lost Take </span><span>its texture and voice by opening it to those he trusts. They help him
    cash in: Tapes 'n Tapes guitarist Erik Applewick allows Dosh to turn a cresting,
    triumphant drum beat and a beautiful, ""Chariots of Fire""-sized piano into ""Mpls
    Rock and Roll"", a redeeming anthem that beams like re-imagined, premium
    post-rock staved for concision. Applewick's static, crunchy chords offer Dosh's
    drums space to crack. In fact, the collaborations here are entirely about
    setting up chances for something to happen: The melody of closer ""The Lost
    Take"" doesn't appear for a full minute, and-- when it does-- it's but a mechanism
    for Happy Apple's Mike Lewis to climb aboard, playing one of the album's most
    straightforward vamps. Dosh, of course, summarily splits it and lets it chase
    itself. After all, he never said getting emotional was easy. But it sounds so
    satisfying here, you'll kind of wish it was.</span>

    mention guitarist Terry Six's incredibly fortuitous, <em>Fearless</em>-style
    survival-- you might expect a dour album of infinite sadness from Six's
    post-Hearts project. But the Nice Boys have found a better way to eulogize the
    Hearts' career, by flipping up their leather jacket collars and waxing <em>Guitar
    Romantic</em>, exploring and expanding upon 1970s power-pop while using the
    genre as a coping mechanism.</p><p>
    If <em>The Nice Boys</em> is generally a sober,
    straight-laced album,<em> </em>""Avenue 29"" sprouts up as a brief drug
    binge. It's the only track not kickstarted by a compact riff or fist-pumping
    drum beat, and Six's lethargic, nasally vocals recall Brian Jonestown Massacre
    or even Olivia Tremor Control at their most conventionally pop. ""Cheryl
    Anne (Carry On)"" adds another wrinkle to the readymade Heartbreakers/T.
    Rex template, injecting a heavy dose of psychedelic glam into a track already
    rife with trippy chromatic shifts and ethereal harmonies.</p><p>
    These moments aside, the Boys stick to their guns on
    the album's finest cuts. Six's pubescent-like awkwardness-- perhaps the band's most
    prominent characteristic-- drives many of the songs, adding poignancy to the
    emotional lows and rendering the highs that much easier to rally around.
    Whether trash-talking in the least intimidating way possible on ""Ain't
    That Beat"" or straining to squeak out those high notes on opening war cry
    ""Teenage Nights"", the Nice Boys strike uncomfortable rock poses like
    a hired prom band, crafting a huge arena-ready sound by casting it on a
    proportionately small canvas. The stakes seem high, even if the subject matter
    stays on the trials and tribulations of teenagers at night.
    </p><p>
    Understandably, the power-pop here falls considerably
    short of <em>At Budokan</em> or even <em>Guitar Romantic</em> levels of geeky bacchanalia.
    Whereas Hearts anthems like ""Modern Kicks"" strove to kick ass, the
    Nice Boys live up to their name, content to lean against the jukebox and smoke
    their cigarettes. Same leather-studded aura of cool, just minus the proactive
    streak. While nine times out of 10 anyone in the cafeteria would choose to run
    with the badass bullies over the conventional dorks, the Nice Boys' nuanced
    retro-rock charm make it worth leaving the cool table every once in a while.

    For a band that's worked so carefully to discredit rock's
    premium on accessibility and idolatry (see: surgical-mask get-ups, cryptic
    song titles, singer Ade Blackburn's inscrutable delivery), Clinic's
    discography follows the standard pop playbook to a tee: They released a string of early EPs and the primordial,
    career-making debut album (2000's <em>Internal Wrangler</em>), followed by a more refined,
    smoothed-out sophomore effort (2002's <em>Walking With Thee</em>), and then the
    meandering, disappointing third album (2004's <em>Winchester Cathedral</em>). So you
    don't have to listen to <em>Visitations</em> to know that the Liverpool foursome's
    fourth album is the inevitable Return to Form, a reinstatement of <em>Internal
    Wrangler</em>'s lo-fi abrasion that will be wholeheartedly welcomed by those who found
    themselves dozing off during <em>Winchester Cathedral</em>'s second half.</p><p>
    Despite all their knowing nods to the rock crit-approved
    canon-- from the Velvet Underground and Phil Spector to Can and Pixies to Lee Perry and
    Smokey Robinson-- Clinic have always thought more like hip-hop producers than a
    retro-rock band; their greatest achievements have been the product of radical recontextualizing
    rather than simple recycling. But on <em>Visitations</em>, Clinic's source material is...
    themselves. As refreshing as it is to hear the band rock out again with such
    sinister/seductive charisma, <em>Visitations</em> essentially peaks with its two
    high-contrast opening tracks, the crater-stomping hillbilly rampage ""Family""
    and the ghostly girl-group piece ""Animal Human"", both of which also account for
    the album's very minor aesthetic developments: namely that guitarist Hartley
    seems to have purchased a finger slide and wah-wah pedal.</p><p>
    Beyond that, it's business as usual: ""Tusk"" is the
    sort of revved-up garage-punk racket heard on the band's early singles;
    ""Harvest (Within You)"" assumes the bassline bounce of <em>Internal Wrangler</em>'s  ""The Second Line"" (though, unlike its
    predecessor, it resists the urge to lock into a four-on-the-floor beat);  ""If You Could Read Your Mind"" pulses
    with the strobe-lit go-go groove of <em>Internal Wrangler</em>'s title track, right
    down to the maracas and psych-out effects. 
    </p>
<p>
    If this cross-referencing
    seems excessive, it's only because Clinic's recombinant rock so wantonly
    invites it. Throughout the album, drummer Carl Tunney actually sounds
    determined not to hit his snare, relying instead on a relentless kickdrum
    thump and clipped hi-hat ticks that sublimate the rhythm while emphasizing the
    songs' corrosive surfaces. This lends <em>Visitations</em> a rumbling, tumbling
    momentum but makes the album sound more uniform than it ought to; ""Family"" and
    ""Children of Kellogg"" are practically the same song, except the former ends with
    a bomb explosion while the latter dissolves into a brief slowdance denouement
    that you'll wish the band had explored further.
    </p>
<p>
    Though <em>Visitations</em> is not without moments of calm (for instance, the melodica-guided moonlit stroll of ""Paradise""), there's nothing here nearly as
    affecting as <em>Internal Wrangler</em>'s ""Distortions"" or <em>Winchester Cathedral</em>'s
    ""Falstaff""-- an emotional centerpiece where we get a glimpse of the fear and
    vulnerability otherwise shielded by Blackburn's intimidating mask. For all the
    possibilities suggested by their debut album, Clinic are threatening to
    become the sort of rock band of which you only really need to own one album, and

    It may be true that ""hipsters hate Jesus,"" as Pitchfork columnist Chris Dahlen <u><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/14710/Column_Column_Get_That_Out_of_Your_Mouth_21"">claimed</a></u> in January. Still, the bedheaded masses (Pitchfork included) are quick to bury any anti-Christian hatchets when they feel a particular work or artist warrants it, and their acceptance isn't limited to old gospel cuts, the Louvin Brothers, or Johnny Cash. More recent critics' darlings (Neutral Milk Hotel, Sufjan Stevens, Kanye West) have all won over whole tribes of heathens with songs of religious devotion.</p><p>
    Of course, Cold War Kids aren't a Christian band. They've even said so. ""No, no, we don't wanna be that,"" lead singer Nathan Willett told <em>OC Weekly</em>. ""Definitely not at all."" Fair play: No one wants to be pigeonholed-- not even Scott Stapp. Besides, the brand of religiosity hovering throughout this California quartet's full-length debut is a little different from the hippie love-faith of ""King of Carrot Flowers"" or <em>Seven Swans</em>. Still, we indie rock fans aren't as slow as we may look on Flickr. With superficial storytelling, monolithic melodies, and the heavy-handed symbolism of a school project, <em>Robbers and Cowards</em> insults our intelligence a few times too often.</p><p>
    It would help if the record lived up even a little bit to the mostly positive notices for Cold War Kids' incessant live shows. On the strength of those shows, and a string of EPs, the band positioned itself as another potential breakout artist crowned by the emerging cabal of non-traditional tastemakers (the online press, blogs, TV and marketing music programmers, and, uh, Zach Braff). And yet, like too many of this year's blogbuzzes, their most distinguishing feature is cozy familiarity; the sad reality is that the democratization of music-scouting too often results in listeners gravitating toward artists that sound like their favorite bands rather than unearthing new, brave, oft-ignored sounds. 
    </p>
<p>
    So meet the new group, same as the old groups: Willett's outsized vibrato blares and preens like a Jeff Buckley zombie, or at least a rock'n'roll Jason Mraz. The band navigates superfluous time-signature changes while zigzagging between edgy Spoon jitterscapes and White Stripes blooz-rawk affectations, with the occasional dive into the kind of clanking Eastern European gutter polka more deftly explored by Man Man, DeVotchka, and <em>Rain Dogs</em>. It's a polished (if backward-looking) pastiche, cleaner and annoyingly louder on the album than on the three previous EPs. 
    </p>
<p>
    While <em>Robbers and Cowards</em> largely swears off quasi-autobiographical songwriting in favor of preachy narratives, its best track is an exception to the rule. On ""Hang Me Up to Dry"", Willett swaggers amid jagged guitars and off-kilter pianos, stuttering like a veteran rock showman, and it's almost fun enough that the song's central relationship-as-laundry metaphor doesn't need to make sense. Elsewhere, the songs weave cookie-cutter stories around such complex topics as alcoholic fathers, death row, and terminal illness. But hey, they're just Kids: On prison howler ""Saint John"", Willett screams ""ob-seen-it-ies"" like someone who's never heard the word before; on rootsy ""Tell Me in the Morning"", he's ""shouting questions like a fistfight."" 
    </p>
<p>
    All the yelling and yammering eventually wears thin, but Cold War Kids do change pace. Soft/loud ""God, Make Up Your Mind"" drops smart-teenager surnames like Garcia Marquez and Salinger while debating whether it's more effective to be a politician or a musician. Elsewhere, ""Pregnant"" meanders over acoustic strums, whistles, and an answering machine, as Willett recycles clichés like ""pregnant with doubt"" and ""lift up the rug and sweep it underneath."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Unlike the idiosyncratic hymns of Sufjan Stevens or Jeff Mangum,<em> Robbers and Cowards</em> often relies on veiled evangelical boilerplates. Blue Staters might not recognize the rote figurative language right away, but many others will: how ""put out the fire on us"" from ""Hospital Beds"" signifies a call for baptism, or how the sudden shift on ""Saint John"" to ""All us boys on death row/ We're all waiting for a pardon"" is a reminder that we're each of us sentenced to die unless we accept God's redeeming grace. Teetotalism, original sin, and abstinence until marriage also loom large-- particularly striking in a musical tradition that traces its roots through the gritty nihilism of the Velvet Underground, who used Judeo-Christian language to their own avant-garde ends. 
    </p>
<p>
    At the end of hidden track ""Sermons vs. the Gospel"", which dismisses <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, psychoanalysis, and European vacations before somehow absolving ""stealing from the poor,"" Willett yowls, ""Lord, have mercy on me/ I believe the words can change the heart"" (another Salinger reference); ""When you accept Christ as the savior, it changes your heart,"" said George W. Bush in a 2000 presidential debate. There's no objective reason a record of musically or ideologically conservative indie rock couldn't succeed on its own terms, like my favorite recent country records, but this isn't the one. It doesn't even want to be.

    Considering how prolific they are, (D) Yellow Swans have
    an uncanny knack for making each of their records sound like the best yet. Once a given
    release recedes into the duo's vast catalog, the
    question of which LP is superior seems pointless. On the first few listens, <span style=""font-style: italic"">Psychic
    Secession, Drift, Dreamed, </span>and<span style=""font-style: italic""> </span>even
    the bombastic, cartoonish <span style=""font-style: italic"">Bring the Neon War Home</span> all sounded like new steps
    forward. So it's not especially surprising that the limited-edition <span style=""font-style: italic"">Global
    Clone, </span>despite
    being a rather nondescript collection of untitled selections from
    previously released cassettes, feels like another first-look revelation.</p><p>
    The most noticeable change here is a surprising lack
    of rhythm. Most Yellow Swans records deploy all kinds of pulsating beats-- anything from a pounding drum machine to a wavy background rumble. Here, few discernible
    beats emerge, yet each piece still throbs to an insistent internal clock. Track
    1 traces slow sonic curves, ringing like a massive bell pushed up and down by
    tidal drones. Track 3 plays with perceptions of time, chopping itself into tiny blips, then
    melting vocal screeches into rippling tones. Tracks 4 and 5, the only two taken
    from the same cassette (last year's <span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic"">Damaged Yellow Swans </span>on 23 Productions), use volume as
    a weapon, building an intense rattle that at one point sounds like violins
    sawed into crunchy ones and zeroes.</p><p>
    Almost as long as those four pieces combined is Track 2, a
    23-minute trip down a widening river of electronic fuzz. It could take
    thousands of words to describe this piece's colorful landscape, but highlights
    include a quick pound that blurs into percussive chatter, heavy moans that
    merge with distortion like ghosts fading into clouds, and a huge buzz that
    rustles your skin even more than it blows your ears. Yellow Swans tracks
    approximating this length are hardly scarce, but this one stands with the duo's best epics.<span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic""></span>
</p>
<p>
<em>Global Clone</em> has been tagged with terms like 'lovely,'
    'dreamy,' and 'gorgeous,' and I don't disagree. But you probably need to have
    already dunked your head pretty deep into Yellow Swans' discography to hear the
    album in that light. At first, the
    penetrating whine of Track 1, the siren blasts of Track 4, and the gale-force
    howls of Track 5 might seem like forbidding walls of harsh sound, especially
    with no obvious beat to grab onto. Since the album needs to be punctured a bit
    to get to the soft noises and fluid drones inside, the uninitiated might be
    better off starting with any of the previous records listed above. But don't
    wait too long to get to <span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic"">Global Clone.</span> Given this duo's track record, it won't be the best
    Yellow Swans album for long.

    As if the name weren't enough, the first two songs on
    this album wear their faults on their sleeve. ""I Don't Know Where 2
    Start"" and ""Highways of our Mindz"" make a show of
    sloppy-cum-cute, like a cross between Pavement and the soundtrack to a Peanuts
    cartoon. On the former, Singley sings just under the notes over short bursts of
    guitar and elementary drums, not to mention liberal bursts of laser sound
    effects. ""Highways of our Mindz"" rolls over itself even harder, a
    knee-slapping sing-a-long that's unselfconscious if not exactly tuneful, sounding
    rosy-cheeked and squeezably soft.</p><p>
    Then something unexpected happens. ""Yr Little Hand
    in Mind"" is a sudden shift in mood, a fingerpicked acoustic ballad with
    a swooning Beach Boys choir behind Singley.
    The mood flips again with the following ""Short Sleeve Stumblah"", a
    burst of epileptic lo-fi, and then flattens out with ""Bank of the
    SUN"", which is just as unpredictable as the album's opening, but has a
    strong enough melody to hold it together. And, more lasers.</p><p>
    ""Watersong"" is another surprisingly gentle
    turn, a weighty piano ballad without the sap, which segues into the
    instrumental reprise ""Seahorse"". It floats into some familiar Flaming
    Lips territory, but it's an innocuous tribute. After hearing a few more coy, gentle
    songs like ""Holyrollercoaster"" or the country-flecked surrealism of
    ""Underneath"", inexplicable punctuation and judicious use of
    ""z"" in song titles (and the band name) seems less like
    attention-seeking and more like a personal quirk. 
    </p>
    I
    don't love every track, but I do feel like I've entered a back door into
    someone's creative process, short as his attention span may be. It's hard to
    say if the album is greater or worse just for playing bait and switch with the
    first two tracks. Is pacing really that important? As is, Alan Singley and his
    band certainly manage to surprise, and hindsight does put those opening tracks
    in a new, more tolerable light. What started out sounding like nothing I needed
    to hear became, just maybe, the work of an unsure talent. I'm very curious to
    hear what he does next, whether he decides to embrace or eschew cohesion in his
    records. <em>Lovingkindness</em> sits somewhere in between, shuffling its feet.</div>"|9459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9459-lovingkindness/|6.9|Jason Crock

    When albums are meant to happen, something palpable radiates from the
    tracks. Energy is delivered because it has no other place else to go, and the
    ensuing sense of release transcends genre: It's as true for <em>Three Feet High
    and Rising </em>and<em> The Blueprint</em> as it is for <em>The Velvet Underground
    &amp; Nico </em>and<em> Marquee Moon</em>.</p><p>
<em>Connected</em>-- the 2003 collaboration between then little-known North
    Carolina MC Phonte Coleman and a Dutch producer named Nicolay-- felt like that.
    The two met through an Okayplayer message board. Though they had never spoken,
    Nicolay and Phonte managed an online-only collaboration as Foreign Exchange
    that crossed platforms and topics with ease, blending Nicolay's kaleidoscopic
    production with Phonte's characteristically self-effacing and trenchant lyrics.
    Phonte followed rhapsodies of love gone wrong with lambastes of welfare policy;
    Nicolay's terrific beats made the tracks seamless, timely, nearly perfect.</p><p>
    But <em>Here</em>, Nicolay's proper debut-- three years and beats on two-dozen
    other albums later-- suggests none of that urgency. Instead, it sounds like a
    predictable album of grooves from a capable producer copping verses and hooks
    from substandard friends. 
    </p>
<p>
    Coleman appears, for instance, only by way of intro to <em>Here</em>'s first
    proper track, ""I Love the Way You Love Me"". He quips, ""Let's
    go"" before Nicolay's beat drops and Justus League affiliate Darien
    Brockington eases in on a bed of multi-tracked, new soul vocals. Just 10
    seconds into the first verse, one of <em>Here</em>'s<em> </em>two critical
    quandaries is apparent: ""I love the way you make me feel when I'm here
    with you (You make me feel special)/ Laying next to you, kissing you, touching
    you/ Wanting you, loving you, over and over again,"" sings Brockington,
    soft-stepping over Nicolay's modal bassline like a debutante glad to be walking
    in shoes so pretty. Brockington seems too intimated to deliver anything beyond
    pleasantries, too busy finessing his clichés to say something he believes. It
    epitomizes his experience chiefly as a hookman, and Nicolay's choice to drop
    Brockington's first major solo spot immediately after the intro is a doormat to
    an album of banality. 
    </p>
<p>
    St. Louis rapper Black Spade's ""I Am the Man"" immediately hops on
    the underground superiority/master-of-mic tip. ""Your skills are rented/
    It's time to give them back to AVIS,"" he spits in the first verse,
    ignoring the notion that Nicolay's blissful, horn-heavy boom-bap is an open
    invitation to descend from the high horse of hackneyed beef. It's a jarring
    effect, especially on the heels of Brockington's r&amp;b beam, and such
    flightiness is the disc's second fault. Such lack of cohesion creates a seam, the kind of fabric split that
    subdivides almost every bit of momentum <em>Here </em>ever finds. 
    </p>
<p>
    Given Spade's spot on three of the album's 11 tracks, he and Nicolay are
    both culpable. Together, they seem unaware of the need for focus. YahZarah's
    siren song on ""Adore"" is marred by Spade's preceding ego stroking.
    Sure, his delivery-- a heavy swagger that swings hard, fast and sometimes
    playful-- is solid enough, but lyrically he lobs the same subterranean
    softballs. Amid references to the ""hustle and flow"" of hip-hop and
    the major-label-as-pimp metaphorical malaise, he even manages to unearth the
    2004 time capsule, ""I'm Sick James, bitch, not Rick James, bitch."" 
    </p>
    Still,
    <em>Here</em>'s failure actually hurts because, as a producer, Nicolay continues
    to warrant major notice, though his work now comes botched by deference to
    mediocrity. Nicolay shifts between verse and chorus and back again flawlessly,
    accomplishing a lot by tampering with very little, perhaps by adding only a
    step or sound per measure. At their best, those beats are selfless beauty,
    their simple austerity handing steady reins to a group of performers that
    clearly aren't ready.</div>"|9503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9503-here/|4.4|Grayson Currin

    So, the title's just a pun. Peter Morén, Bjorn Yttling, and John Erikkson all wrote songs for their third album, <em>Writer's Block, </em>but where last year's heartbroken <em>Falling Out</em> drew inspiration mainly from 1960s pop, the Stockholm-based trio's latest LP finds them aspiring to new levels of sonic diversity, exploring everything from lo-fi 80s electronics and shoegaze guitars to slacker beats and icy dreamscapes. It's a lot of new ground for a band to have covered in a year's time; fortunately, PB&amp;J (uh, yeah, we know) managed to harness their melodic expertise and cultivate their textural craftsmanship at precisely the same time. The result is their most focused and fully realized effort yet-- an
    album that adds an imperial hugeness to the teen noir and garage-y
    psychedelia of their past efforts-- and one of the better pop records
    we've heard this year.</p><p>
    Aided by Yttling's solid production (he's also worked with the Concretes and Shout Out Louds), <em>Writer's Block</em>'s sonic textures demand attention first: odd synths, overdriven bass, dreamy harmonies, rolling drums, pink streaks of guitar noise, or a foot tapping in soft focus. But ultimately, the album is just as notable for the way it captures both the electric first moments of a deep relationship and the bleary aftermath of post-breakup malaise. The infectious, lazily whistled hook and playful bongo drums of first single ""Young Folks"" are immediately inviting, but the song's second layer-- the coy chemistry between Morén and ex-Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman-- adds depth, as the song's two hopeful strangers discover each other by chance: ""All we care about is talking/ Talking only me and you.""</p><p>
    As an album, <em>Writer's Block</em> shares these new lovers' singular focus. ""Paris 2004"" is a classical guitar-tinged traveler's ballad in the manner of John Cale's near-perfect ""Andalucia"", exchanging Cale's studied ambiguity for sentimental bedazzlement; Erikkson's ""Start to Melt"" flickers with amazed adoration; and Morén's ""Objects of My Affection"" combines the dramatic flair of an uncharacteristically upbeat Morrissey with the nasal vocals and ringing acoustic guitars of a post-<em>Loveless </em>""Like a Rolling Stone"". 
    </p>
<p>
    The album's narrators cast an equally attentive eye on love's jagged downside. Amid the simplistic percussion and glassy Flaming Lips chorus of ""Amsterdam"", Yttling mopes over his loneliness during a lover's vacation, before Erikkson's starry-eyed ""Up Against the Wall"" pictures a relationship at the precipice. ""It's almost that I wish we hadn't met at all,"" sings Erikkson against a crystalline rhythm that could pack a John Hughes prom. 
    </p>
<p>
    Written by the full trio, ""The Chills"" pays quiet homage to the New Zealand indie group of the same name, and steeps its bitterness in caustic one-liners (""Your tongue is sharp/ But I miss the taste of it""). And at last, Yttling's big-screen ""Roll the Credits"" pictures an escape, but as usual on <em>Writer's Block</em>, the romance fills the frame: ""It's between me and her now/ Can't separate at all/ Let's put the cards back in the sleeve."" Only droning closer ""Poor Cow"" kills the mood, like the George Harrison sitar song contrarians might revisit when the rest of the album grows overly familiar. 
    </p>
<p>
    For Peter Bjorn &amp; John-- as with their Pitchfork-approved compatriots-- love is all. As such, a certain amount of actual writer's block should have been expected; after all, what <em>Writer's Block</em> seeks to portray is, in the end, ineffable. ""And the question is: Was I more alive then than I am now?"" Morén wonders on ""Objects of My Affection"", rejoindering, ""I happily have to disagree/ I laugh more often now/ I cry more often now/ I am more me."" If lyric poetry is, as Czech novelist Milan Kundera recently wrote, ""the most exemplary incarnation of man dazzled by his own soul and the desire to make it heard,"" surely the pop song is the highest incarnation of all-consuming love and its fundamental need to be shared. <em>Writer's Block</em>, indeed.

    Gough's fifth album in six years, recycles the chord progression and guitar melody
    from ""The Shining"", the first song on his first album, 2000's justly
    loved <em>The Hour of Bewilderbeast</em>. The
    obvious bit of self-reference is a disheartening representation of how much
    this once-promising Brit has squandered his potential. Whereas winsome cello and french horn-laden orchestration introduced ""The
    Shining"" with a welcome dose of humble folksiness, ""The Time
    of Times"" is blown-out and schmaltzy, with busy tap-tap percussion
    competing with crass strings and bumptious piano. Even worse, ""The Time of
    Times"" is one of the more listenable moments on <em>Born in the U.K.</em></p><p>
    With its rah-rah title, well-manicured production, and simplified
    themes of love and loss, the new album is a blatant rush at England's
    pop charts. Moving from indie XL to biggie EMI in his native country, Gough
    gets caught up in his own chart ambitions, leaving the music suffering somewhere underneath. Continuing
    the downward critical trajectory of his now-rancid output, <em>Born </em>is his blandest, most non-descript offering yet. Even the so-so <em>Have You Fed
    the Fish?</em> seems like a masterpiece in comparison to the downtrodden piano banalities
    that slosh all over this latest nadir. To realize his LCD vision, the cloth-hatted troubadour taps into the easy-listening ivory
    drones of Billy Joel, Burt Bacharch, and Elton John at their appeasing worst. Furthermore, every
    speck of the songwriter's Hobbit-like wackiness and humor is flushed out in
    favor of meaningless nuggets of Dr. Phil babble that would even have Zach
    Braff's eyes rolling.</p><p>
    Though never a great lyricist, Gough once managed to cover his more embarrassing couplets with unpredictable stylistic switch-ups and a bevy of sparkling instrumentals. Since his early EPs and debut LP, though, his
    gags-per-song count has escalated, reaching its unfortunate peak on <em>Born</em>. Though
    he was on the Springsteen bandwagon well before Bruce's current ""it""
    influence status, Gough displays none of the Boss' hearty drama here. At his
    most potent, Springsteen managed to hit on universal truths by way of
    remarkably on-target specifics, e.g. the fully-fleshed Shakespearean theatrics of
    ""Jungleland"". But, like the Killers, Gough seemingly wants to hit on
    Springsteen-ian angst without having to worry about such time-consuming details. So we
    get a deluge of gutless broadsides buried under years of overuse. The flat,
    mid-tempo ""Degrees of Separation"" attempts to overcome
    ambiguous relationship troubles with lines like ""even though there's no
    way out, we'll find one"" and ""I'll be by your side, believe me."" Cornball ballad ""Promises"" has Gough wondering, ""But
    how will we carry on/ When all of these things have gone?"" where the
    ""things"" are lazily undefined. While there's something to be said for allowing listeners to fill in songwriting
    blanks with their own experience it's generally useless when the accompanying
    music is this piddling.
    </p><p>
    Talking about his heightened populist bent, Gough recently
    said, ""I don't really wanna be James Blunt... with mediocre material that
    makes it to No. 1. But... I've come 'round to thinking, well, actually, you can't
    fault what he's done."" And, after <em>Born</em>, this half-hearted,
    anti-critical justification seems desperate. Whether Gough will make it to No.
    1 has yet to be seen, but there's no question about his close proximity to
    Blunt-style mediocrity. The closing lines of the album once again have him singing Springsteen. ""And if we still don't have a
    plan,"" he says, ""We'll listen to 'Thunder
    Road'."" But if he hopes to snap his streak of blah bromides, Gough will have to produce more than empty reference points.

    touring the country to promote it. Maybe some day they'll have kids and groom
    them into band members, but for now just the two of them make plenty of noise, and <em>Get Yr Blood Sucked Out</em> is confident,
    psychedelic, hard-hitting, and the best noise they've made yet.</p><p>
    The duo's sound has sharpened, with more spacious production,
    simpler arrangements, and more refined songcraft: Where their three
    previous records all took a little time to marinate, this one is strikingly
    immediate. It opens with a beat and feel reminiscent of Blur's ""Tender"", but
    the harmony is much more tense, and rather than a gospel choir, ""Believer"" has
    two voices harmonizing, calm to the point of sinister, and Anita's screaming
    lead guitar. Her guitar is one of the album's biggest trump cards-- in an era when flashy leads are hard to come by it's
    something of a relief to hear economical fretboard fireworks like the
    squawking, melodic solo on ""From the Devil Himself"".</p><p>
    Not that her husband gives her much slack to pick up. His
    drum parts are engaging and frequently memorable as hooks in their own right.
    If nothing else, it seems clear that touring has honed their skill as musicians
    to a fine point, and this may be why they've had the confidence to keep the
    arrangements more basic this time out. Whatever the reason, it works
    beautifully. ""Faster Than a Dead Horse"" is a masterful pop song, with Kevin
    providing killer ""bah bah"" backing vocals for Anita's double-tracked lead. She
    can't wait to sling her guitar, cutting loose after just one verse and sending
    up a distorted torrent after the second.
    </p>
<p>
    While the uptempo tracks bring the crunchy thunder, the
    quieter ones can be just as gripping. ""Special Thing"", sung by Kevin, is almost
    wispy, adrift in reverb, but it sticks with you, almost as well as the song
    that follows. ""Never Be Like Yesterday"" opens with a quick little snippet of
    Mercury Rev-ish saw and ambience, sliding into a comfortable piano groove with
    fluttering guitar accents. The arrangement perfectly matches the weariness of
    its protagonist, one half of a couple who stayed up all night arguing.
    </p>
<p>
    There's of course a possibility that they wrote that song
    together after living through it first, but regardless of whether or not they
    fight just like every other married couple, they're on the
    same page when it comes to their music, and they could hardly have outlined their new
    focus better than they do with the song title ""We Do Not Fuck Around"".

    In preparation for this review, I reread my piece on Joseph
    Arthur's previous album,<em> Our Shadows Will
    Remain</em>, from October 2004. I came across this sentence, tucked away in the
    third paragraph, and had to reread it twice to understand its full
    implications: ""Always more naively sincere boho than detached hipster, Arthur
    left his apartment studio in his adopted hometown of New
    York and decamped to the relative safety of New
    Orleans to record <em>Our Shadows Will Remain</em>."" Who
    could have predicted that less than a year after that album was released and
    that review ran, Arthur's adopted hometown would become a bigger disaster
    area-- and an equally hotly contested battleground-- than the terrorist-rattled
    New York he'd left?</p><p>
    If <em>Our Shadows Will
    Remain</em> was Arthur's post-9/11 album, full of despair pitched between public
    and private, it makes sense that <em>Nuclear
    Daydream</em> would be his post-Katrina album. He's too engaged with the world,
    too anchored in real life, for it not to be (in fact, his song ""In the Sun"" was
    rerecorded by Michael Stipe and became the name of a Katrina relief
    organization). However, Arthur never addresses the subject directly on this
    album and maintains a respectable lyrical ambiguity, implying both a personal
    and a communal transformation but preventing easy catharsis or real-life
    correlations. As a result, <em>Nuclear
    Daydream</em> could be about a specific person (there are numerous references to
    needles and pills, suggesting a battle-- his or a friend's-- with drugs or some
    other temptation) as easily as it could pertain to a specific city. Still, a vague
    malaise pervades <em>Nuclear Daydream</em>, informing
    each song whether downcast (""Electrical Storm"") or upbeat (""Enough to Get Away"").</p><p>
    It's not unlike the melancholy that informs his previous
    albums, lyrically if not musically. He's abandoned the chaotic New
    York self-portraits of his first two albums, which
    mirrored the primitive scrawl of his paintings, and now favors a cleaner, more practiced
    sound with more room for ambition. In fact, he seems to be entering a phase
    similar to post-<em>Pop</em> U2 or midcareer
    R.E.M., when experience and ambition has erased most regional quirks or
    personal eccentricities. <em>Nuclear Daydream</em>
    sounds placeless, as if striving for universality. At times the music sounds
    like it could actually achieve that lofty goal; at times it just sounds
    blanched, drifting into a kind of anonymity.
    </p>
<p>
    Arthur seems to be reckoning with and trying to ward off
    this new, nameless malaise, and as a result, the songs sound unsettled,
    slightly off. Nothing-- not even the Jesus-loves-you chorus of ""Don't Tell Your
    Eyes""-- sounds wholly reassuring. Nothing sounds completely hopeless either. On
    ""You Are Free"" he sings, ""I'm not the man I thought I was,"" but it's hard to
    discern whether he's changed for the better or worse-- or, for that matter, whether
    he's referring to himself or speaking for a larger populace that has lost faith
    in itself.
    </p>
<p>
    Moving between public and individual perspectives, <em>Nuclear Daydream</em> begins strongly: ""Too
    Much to Hide"" bounces along on one of Arthur's most memorable melodies, ""Black
    Lexus"" gives a tender portrayal of a self-destructive woman (who may also have
    inspired the drug references), and the transcendent chorus of ""Enough to Get Away""
    promises sweet escape from ""controversy"" to an idyllic haven. Throughout the
    album, Arthur multitracks his vocals so he can harmonize with himself. As a
    result, his stoic, textured tenor contrasts with his grainy falsetto and a
    surprisingly deep bass, suggesting an inner turmoil that's mirrored in the
    lyrics but offset by the precision of the music and his roomy production.
    </p>
<p>
    However, as <em>Nuclear
    Daydream</em> progresses, Arthur's solemnity gets the better of him. He slows
    the tempos, understates the melodies, and closes the album with a set of
    dirgelike acoustic laments that might hold up individually, but they become tiresome
    in succession. ""Automatic Situation"" and ""Don't Give Up on People"" are ethereal
    gospel songs, complete with hints of choir and church piano, but they get lost
    in the cathedral reverb, their melodies not strong enough to hold together in
    all that space. Regardless of its shortcomings and its
    inspirations, <em>Nuclear Daydream</em> proves
    a potent pair with its predecessor, not just in the progression from atomic to
    nuclear or from New York to New
    Orleans. But by the time the lackluster title track
    comes around, it feels as though the malaise has finally overtaken Arthur,
    musically if not spiritually.

    What to expect from a record titled <em>Insomniac Doze</em>? Those prone to
    sleep at the prospect of 15-minute songs titled impressionistically after the
    abstract (say, ""The Unknown Glow""), and after further discovering
    those songs are performed by a band, Envy, from a country, Japan, known as the
    spiritual home for musicians who pick up guitars and play them for not minutes
    but months at a time, will likely drift off at the very thought. And disciples
    of Envy's early years, when they formed an unofficial international alliance
    with like-minded post-hardcore bands Yaphet Kotto, in America, and Yage, in
    Germany, might do more than nod off at the news-- they'll likely chuck the
    disc.</p><p>
    Envy's days as a forward-thinking hardcore band are well behind them, and <em>Insomniac
    Doze</em> makes the case that they were never one at all. Their songs were
    always longer, their aesthetic, gauzier: With their stretched-out, openly
    cinematic take on hardcore's slasher-vérité came longer album titles, longer
    sets, even longer hair. Rather than drafting their countrymen Mono's
    slipstream, Envy probably helped pave the way for that quartet's nakedly
    orchestral snooze fests, just as Corrupted's infinite doom and Acid Mothers
    Temple's extended space-time explorations had paved the way for Envy.</p><p>
    On their newest record, Envy sound mild enough for the dentist's office.
    Reminiscent of the film scoring Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky have been
    doing in the last few years, <em>Insomniac Doze</em> accepts the same contours:
    chiming builds and ringing climaxes, drawn-out clean guitar lines, and EBowed
    sustains leading towards mournful bridges. But Tetsuya Fukagawa's tortured
    howl-- as if the band hadn't told him that they're no longer constantly aiming
    for red-- sits on top like an oil slick. 
    </p>
<p>
    The fascination with cinema common to lesser Japanese post-rockers evidences
    a lack of imagination: They reenact scenes of rain falling, the camera circling
    up and away from a kneeling, drenched protagonist. It's the kind of effect that
    draws snickers when beheld firsthand and, post-Godspeed, on record as well;
    Envy, in retaining the gut-punch of their hardcore roots, manage the same
    general arc with less shtick and more gravity.  
    </p>
<p>
    ""Crystallize"" is aggressive but otherwise near-symphonic
    pop that starts out galvanized and soaring before stretching out the confines
    of the song, carrying the melody on echoed, playful note-slivers. When the
    vocal comes in, it's not ethereal Bowie but more like City of Caterpillar,
    another U.S. band who successfully blended abstract-rock with hardcore
    immediacy. Envy's ""Shield of Selflessness"" successfully takes City of
    Caterpillar's mid-tempo blast and adds even more bombast, replacing naked panic
    with a kind of existential sadness, conjuring vast empty landscapes and cold
    vacant rooms. ""Night in Winter"" drops the storm entirely, suggesting
    only its drained aftermath. 
    </p>
<p>
    So too with <em>Insomniac Doze</em>-- gone is the furious band that once
    expanded rock palettes with tricky arpeggios and lots of air. Instead, Envy
    have given themselves completely to their once dormant spacey impulses and
    time-lapse songwriting. Your interest may well depend on your attention span.

    One of the stranger perks of this new Goldfrapp remix collection is how much it's helped clarify all the reasons I could never really love the duo's last album, <em>Supernature</em>. The record was certainly stylish-- a big, terrifying burst of electronic glam, ridiculously chic, complete with glitterball ponies and horse-headed dancers and evil-Kylie choreography. It was, in fact, so immediately, energetically, and obviously cool that snatches of it now adorn commercials for all manner of consumer products. But despite all that, the damned thing just didn't <em>sound</em> very good.</p><p>
    Between its grainy buzz, its massive tidal waves of synthesizer, its overwhelming machine-tooled energy, and the blaringly loud volume at which records are mastered these days, <em>Supernature</em> wound up feeling like a bully. And while being bullied by Goldfrapp can be an awfully pleasant experience for a song or two, at album length it was draining. Even with some slower tunes in the middle, the effect was like watching a cheerleading tournament on cable: The first routine can seem pretty spectacular, but by the fourth the whole thing becomes a torturous hell of overstimulation and noise, to the point where you practically need to listen to some Garrison Keillor just to regain your composure. (This is how really old people experience the world <em>all the time</em>.)</p><p>
    All of which makes <em>We Are Glitter</em> one of a special category of remix albums-- the sort that actually settles down from the originals, spinning brash, bullying pop out into something slower-building, more spacious, and more dynamic. This is dancefloor Goldfrapp that actually lets you breathe. The selection of remixers is impressive, and while the tracks a lot of them turn in are just about exactly what you'd expect of them there's a variety to the results that makes the experience of listening through the disc a much more comfortable one.</p><p>
    The best of the bunch diffuse their tension over slow builds. The standout is Detroit techno legend Carl Craig's take on ""Fly Me Away"", which he turns-- and I mean this literally-- into Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"": That touchstone Moroder bassline goes pulsing up and down while Alison G. coos all alone around it, making a good bid for the exquisite sense of space and suspended motion in the original. Same goes for French house legends Alan Braxe and Fred Falke reworking ""Number One"" and prodding it slowly up into some elegant synth pads and swells: If this is Autobahn-cruising music, it's Autobahn-cruising with A Flock of Seagulls in the back seat.</p><p>
    Closer to the you-get-what-you-expect category are Ewan Pearson-- whose bubbly ""Disco Odyssey"" version of ""Ride a White Horse"" is all laser-gun zapping and candy-colored twitters-- and T. Raumschmiere, whose presence here might be too appropriate for its own good. (Goldfrapp are already the pop superstars of the kind of buzzing synthesizer glam Raumschmiere usually delivers, and he sounds like he's not sure what else he was meant to bring to the table.) Benny Benassi's squishy, happy-faced Euro sensibility can be as immediately loveable as Goldfrapp's-- as evidenced by a similarly high level of commercial placements-- and you'd think he'd combine with the fearsomely awesome ""Ooh La La"" to create something mindblowing, but not quite: The result is a great seven-minute stomper, ideal for dancefloor functionality, but not exactly a revelation.</p><p>
    Variety comes courtesy of Múm, who make pretty, minimalist music-box tunes out of two tracks, and also from the DFA, whose contribution could <em>almost</em> be the big treasure here. Despite the initial sense that they've just turned ""Slide In"" into a Rapture song, the bulk of the track manages to turn out enthralling, a twitchy disco treat built mostly on hand percussion and one lazy vocal refrain; the only shame is that the center of the thing devolves into the hand-percussion equivalent of noodling. Also on the noodling front: the Flaming Lips remixing ""Satin Chic""-- their setting the vocal parts in a string-heavy instrumental arrangement doesn't seem to have much of a point, but it's certainly a nice breather.</p><p>
    And breathers are one of the selling points here: It's not even that stellar of a collection, and yet there are plenty of moments I'd much rather listen to this than <em>Supernature</em>, if only to spare myself the ear fatigue and the full frontal assault. It's a strange thing about Alison Goldfrapp: She's kind of a big weirdo, isn't she? She's imaginative, and some of her most memorable vocal performances have been strange, soft, spooky things. So why the sheer relentlessness of this glam kick? That, weirdly, is the main question this collection brings to mind: Why Goldfrapp don't seem to be making records as varied, spacious, and subtle as their talents might suggest.

    Warning: There will be an excess of namedrops in this review.</p><p>
    French Montreal's Malajube (say it MAL-a-zhoob) are one of those bands with a really flexible RIYL line. It's not that they're derivative-- the inventive arrangements and zealous intensity of their second album make it difficult to countenance any suspicions of opportunistic hit-knitting. But their approach to indie rock is so resolutely <em>of-the-moment </em>that it seems filled with hyper-modern allusions. Malajube's music is labyrinthine, filled with multi-directional trapdoors-- some drop down to lower landings of the songs; some let out into realms recently conquered by other indie heroes (particularly of the Polaris Prize-nominated variety).</p><p>
    More than a Montreal music digest, Malajube's magpie sensibility spreads their matrix of association across national borders. They're more French than Phoenix, but they share a knack for stringing together terrific, self-contained moments: The songs don't progress so much as chain-react, each part exploding out of the last. They have the ramshackle exuberance of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, with raw production that complements the music's blistering energy-- vocals float in the middle distance; corkscrew guitars bleed everywhere; percussion rattles deliriously. Of course, this good-friends/good-times quality can't help but resemble Broken Social Scene, while the periodic screamy avant-pop parts conjure up Animal Collective by way of Wolf Parade, and the bracing moments of unhinged beauty and collective transportation call to mind Tilly and the Wall. 
    </p>
<p>
    But however distinct an affinity Malajube shares with those bands, this is only good for a general idea of what to expect-- what actually happens in the songs is what makes them worth listening to over and over. On ""Montreal-40 Degrees C"", a fey vocal harmony and a squelchy keyboard cut arabesques around bright yet muffled guitars; a low chanting vocal line and a histrionic one splatter around the central quickstep; overall, it's a dreamy melody tweaked to a hyperactive bounce, blissing out in a wash of choral harmonies. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""La Monogamie"" shows how Malajube's unimpeachable melodies can hold even the most disparate moods together-- beginning at a pensive canter, its pastoral acoustic line bursts into a sneer; bedtime-comfy vocals nestle easily against emphatic bellows, then woozy harmonies brush over an airy refrain, ramping up together until they snap into a crashing <em>adieu</em>. ""Le Crabe"" extends and retracts like a spring, shifting effortlessly between a sultry shuffle and hard-charging indie rock blossoming with chiming frictions. ""Fille à Plumes"" is an electrified screamer that wouldn't have been out of place on M83's <em>Before the Dawn Heals Us</em>, with a UFO invasion's worth of squealing bolts and trilled zaps, drenched as always in lurid melody. 
    </p>
<p>
    Stark contrast is one of Malajube's best assests, and it doesn't get much starker than between ""Fille à Plumes"" and the subsequent ""Casse-Cou""; a ghostly box step where funereal arpeggios twist into bass-driven helixes of weird falsetto harmonies. In the album's variegated context, even the jaunty barrelhouse piano and salty doo-wop of ""Ton Plat Favori"" work, as does the spooky tweaker disco of ""La Russe"". Even a passing knowledge of French will reveal that the contrast between the bright music and the lyrics is just as pronounced-- the songs are flecked with black blood, white worms, dogs that sing like cats, broken necks, shit, skeletons, phantoms, and nightmares. But there's also plenty of dancing, which seems more germane to this celebratory, uninhibited album than its goth-grim content.

    Lake of Dracula's career was an explosive blip, mirroring
    the fast-burning stints of the 70s No Wave bands its guitarist Weasel Walter
    fervently championed. The group burst forth in Chicago in 1995 and slammed to a
    halt less than two years later, leaving a single album and a handful of shows
    in their scorched wake. They were too late (and sounded a bit too bright and
    robust) for No Wave, but their noisy punk shook with the devouring spirit of that
    genre's pioneers (Mars, DNA, Teenage Jesus). In fact, Lake of Dracula's tightly wound songs were so vibrant that this posthumous release, a live set that essentially reproduces the self-titled studio debut, still sounds vital 10 years later.<br/></p><p>
    It helps that Lake of Dracula had a stellar pedigree. Alongside Walter, founder and drummer
    of jazz-punk vets the Flying Luttenbachers, the group included former Couch singer
    Marlon Magas, drummer Heather M. from the Scissor Girls, and occasionally ""the
    Manhattanite,"" a pseudonym for U.S. Maple's Al Johnson. The music on <em>Skeletal
    Remains</em> is
    accordingly authoritative, yet refreshingly unjaded. Each track shakes with the wiry energy of the band's
    well-hewn skills and driving inspirations.</p><p>
    Much of that hectic vigor comes from Walter and Magas,
    whose head-to-head sprints form the core of <em>Skeletal Remains</em>' vein-busting pulse. The pair race each other endlessly,
    jostling back and forth for sonic position. Walter's bassy chords enflame the group's pounding rhythms,
    often blurring into noise but always sharp as a knife. Sprayed on top is Magas's distended
    voice, which evokes Mark E. Smith's arrhythmic rants, Johnny Rotten's gobbed
    bleats, and the off-key drool of Darby Crash, who Magas smartly namechecks in
    the first song, ""Four Teachers"" (the only one not taken from the band's
    debut). When delivered in Magas's
    skewed cadence, Ed Wood-worthy couplets like ""Plague of frogs/ hopping in the
    night"" and ""Dracula killed Frankenstein / and then he tried to blow my mind""
    become urgent, skin-crawling pleas.
    </p>
<p>
    There are so many highlights here-- the Erase
    Errata-foreshadowing ""Plague of Frogs"", Walter's two-note quack on ""Violators"",
    Magas's stretched groans on ""Memories of Me""-- that <em>Skeletal Remains</em> is ultimately one long, searing
    beam of throbbing post-punk. The
    group was smart enough not to mess much with the well-paced sequencing of their
    album; halfway through the set, Walter calls out ""Side 2!"" and his mates
    recreate it dutifully. Yet <em>Skeletal
    Remains</em> is no
    rehash. Aside from the fact that
    three tracks from singles and comps are appended, the band's performance adds
    vivid colors to pieces first heard on the debut. Such improvement suggests an even more spectacular takeoff
    might have been in store; let's just be thankful that we got to witness stage
    one.

    Born Ruffians singer/guitarist Luke LaLonde bursts in on the opening
    ""This Sentence Will Ruin/Save Your Life"" like he ran all the way to
    the studio. He doesn't have enough wind to finish his verses, and when he
    defaults to ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!"" on
    the choruses you wonder if maybe he just forgot the words, like he has a
    Ritalin-addled brain that's moving a lot faster than his mouth and he keeps losing
    his place. The way Isaac Brock listened to Black Francis, this guy listened to
    Isaac Brock; he's got the kind of rhythmic push/pull sloppy/punctual phrasing
    that first endeared Brock to the indie hordes way back when, even if he's not
    always sure what to do with it.</p><p>
    Born Ruffians are three Toronto teenagers with the precise sound we imagine
    when we think of indie rock in this post-Arcade Fire, post-CYHSY world.
    Of course, originality doesn't matter much as long as the band gets the
    details right, as BR do. They've got some things going for them: a few of
    these songs are tremendously catchy; they're funny and don't appear to take
    themselves seriously; LaLonde is the kind of loveable nerd you want to root
    for, even if he sounds like he's never heard a note sung by a guy with a decent
    haircut; the rhythm section wants to swing, even if they don't always manage;
    and their debut is only 16 minutes long. That last bit is key. You first
    meet someone at a party, you don't need to hear their life story; 16
    minutes is the perfect length for a firm handshake from Born Ruffians.</p><p>
    That's enough time to know what they're about. They twitch like a little ball of nervous energy on
    ""Merry Little Fancy Things"", LaLonde trembling as he spits out,
    ""It's just the two of us here/ We can talk about it,"" as if talking is
    the last thing on his mind. Once upon a time these geeky misfits didn't stand a
    chance with girls, but post-Gordon Gano vox, that's all changed. When he sings, ""I need a girlfriend I'm lonely/ Someone to love me and bug me/ I need to
    get laid immediately"" on ""This Sentence Will Ruin/Save Your
    Life"", he knows that someone at the next show will be listening to that
    line extra closely. And it's that creepy edge that gives the whininess of the
    vocals the small boost they need. The drawn-out, wordless wails on the
    following ""7<sup>th</sup> Son"" pull the band back sharply into
    annoying territory, but that's the risk when you walk this particular line.
    Still, most of it hits. So far so good.

On the one hand, an insatiable sense of perfectionism and an unobstructed imagination can capture an entirely unique vision. Then again, such unchecked single-mindedness can lead a project to cave under the weight of its own idiosyncratic whims. And while Rafter Roberts, better known as one half of Bunky, certainly had a larger audience than himself in mind on <em>10 Songs</em>, these recordings from 1998 and 1999 have a similarly hermetic feel-- and, more often than not, avoid such auteur pitfalls.</p><p>
    Recorded in San Diego's Go-Homes, an alternative living space he shared with other emerging local talent, the songs demonstrate an inexhaustible patience for layering sonic details and sprawl into such divergent territory as moody instrumental pieces and relatively straightforward indie pop. Throughout the album, Rafter's painstaking approach to production is rich, commanding headphone scrutiny. It's hardly a surprise, given that Rafter has since worked with numerous San Diego bands-- including Black Heart Procession, Castanets, and Pinback to name a few-- as an engineer. That this is his strong suit is abundantly evident on these early recordings: Even when the essential songwriting seems a little anemic, the songs' meticulous construction and lavish arrangements are strong enough to conceal it.</p><p>
    Ironically, some of the best moments on <em>10 Songs</em> are the less focused indulgences. Opener ""Bicycle"" is loaded with wowing flourishes, most notably dense drumming that creates a tense foil for the trebly, plinking patterns that Rafter picks through on an electric guitar. But, as he sings about learning to ride a bike in a whiny timbre that conjures Doug Martsch, the song's melodic weakness becomes apparent. By contrast, the less linear instrumental ""'R' Is for Reach"" wanders unpredictably for eight minutes, shifting its instrumental palette. Rumbling live drums become glitchy beats, the interplay of two woozy saxophones segues into piercing trumpets, and warmly echoing synth notes mark the song's spare coda. Equal parts <em>Entroducing...</em>-era DJ Shadow and David Lynch, ""‘R' Is for Reach"" is haunting and surreal-- and far more compelling than Rafter's stabs at more conventional songcraft. On the violin-laced ""Single Molecule"" and the brooding, whispered ""Dwells In"", this formula for transporting atmospherics proves to be Rafter's most potent.
    </p><p>
    Some of the material on <em>10 Songs</em>, such as the dirge-like ""I Don't Like to Get Down on My Knees"" and the banjo-driven ""You'll Never Win, He Says"", are more easily forgotten. And Rafter's willful cutesiness (sample lyric: ""My friend the crow/ Is reading my journals"") induces the occasional cringe. But these early recordings are such a showcase for Rafter's skills as a multi-instrumentalist and, above all, producer that it's no mystery why Asthmatic Kitty couldn't let these early productions remain unheard.

    Tim Hecker's fourth full-length under his own name
    isn't so much a new direction as a refinement. The differences between 2002's <em>Haunt
    Me Haunt Me, Do It Again</em>, 2003's <em>Radio Amor</em>, and 2004's <em>Mirages</em> are apparent but
    incremental. On each of these records, Hecker plays with pink-into-white noise, tinkling synths that float between the
    speakers, the occasional over-the-airwaves voice, and knotty samples of guitar
    with the Earth-drone pedal pushed to the jet-black metal.</p><p>
    But while Hecker
    continues to revisit some of the same sonic elements, he also seems to be listening
    closely to what works and playing with structure. So his latest record, <em>Harmony
    in Ultraviolet</em>, has none of the docile synth instrumentals he borrowed from
    Brian Eno on his debut, nor the ultimately distracting disembodied radio chatter from the
    follow-up. Rather, he's taken what's left and focused,
    zoomed in, amplified, and stretched.</p><p>
<em>Harmony</em> is, paradoxically, Hecker's most dramatic and most oceanic
    record. The former implies twists, arc, and carefully planned change intended
    to evoke specific effects; the latter suggests stasis, immersion, and a state of
    dreamy contemplation. <em>Harmony </em>manages to be both these things by
    surprising as it mesmerizes, with Hecker reigning in or tempering any jarring
    effects just enough to keep the self-obliterating sense of endless drone
    intact. One key is that the tension never really dissipates, varying only in
    degree and quality. The opening ""Rainbow Blood"" sets the scene with a
    screeching and trebly drone, like an orchestra tuning up in the darkened
    theater where Rebecca del Rio performed in <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, and for the
    next 48 minutes, <em>Harmony </em>keeps the pulse elevated.
    </p>
<p>
    Tuneful passages like the Tangerine Dream sonata ""Chimeras"" leading into the Windy &amp; Carl-like blissout of ""Dungeoneering"" have a
    relatively lulling effect, but the mood remains dark and uneasy. The four-part
    ""Harmony in Blue"" at the album's center, which starts nice and warm,
    is like a gradually descending slope into a coal black pit. The first section begins
    with gently modulating drones and only a bare minimum of glitchy accents; the
    second is dubby and aquatic, with upper harmonics lopped off; the third is a
    slightly lighter and wispier; and the fourth gathers an increasingly
    thick blanket of distortion around chilly, held tones. 
    </p>
<p>
    By the time the suite has finished, the record is
    zipping along on a tightly ratcheted wire, which leads to the heightened drama of the final act. When the floor gives way following ""Harmony in Blue IV"",
    during the explosive ""Radio Spiricon"", it can seem nearly breathtaking, especially at higher volumes. Hecker's
    synths here are massive, sounding like something huge that's been torn in half
    with great force, exposing a bouquet of prickly and splayed binding material.
    We're suddenly seeing the guts of the thing, the album turned inside out. That the following ""Whitecaps of
    White Noise"" gets even crazier with its surges of distortion but then
    bleeds into a funeral organ drone only adds to the emotional punch. This
    closing 22-minute suite is some of the finest abstract electronic music of the
    laptop era.
    </p>
<p>
    What Hecker delivers when he's at his loudest and most noise-drunk is the
    thing that will always bring to mind My Bloody Valentine: a sense of submitting
    to oblivion. The violence inside tracks like ""Spring Heeled Jack Flies
    Tonight"" and the rougher bits in the ""Whitecaps"" section is
    oddly comforting, like it shows a way to tune into and accept the destructive
    chaos of nature. That this racket which Hecker specializes in-- top-heavy with
    prickly static, a dark undercurrent of synths providing a wobbly foundation
    beneath-- can engender such a pleasant sense of surrender is the key to his
    appeal. <em>Harmony in Ultraviolet </em>is sensual body music of a very
    particular kind, and it's the sort of record that asks a lot. But if you trust
    it and go along, it<em> </em>knows exactly where to lay its hands.

But to me, !!!'s <em>Me and Guiliani...</em> is a CD single with a shite B-side, and not no proper EP; by contrast, <em>Xan Valleys</em> consists of a froth-worthy pair of singles, one additional subpar original track, a stunty cover-- these were the vinyl flip-halves of the great singles-- and two remixes of those aforementioned hits that have been already been well skull-trumped, at press time, by a half-dozen uncommissioned others (literally) free-floating around the internets.</p><p>
    But first let's begrudgingly go behind the music: Please stop attending to the abortive concerns of this band's European press, even if Klaxons are fueling it. Who cares how bright or (get it) techno-colored this threesome's togs are? Wardrobe-restaging the first few TLC videos does not a revolution make. Also: Ignore the allusions. The literary stuff-- i.e. the overt refs to Burroughs, Pynchon, Pinchbeck, and the occult-- are just fun feints, fluorescent red herrings, Wikipediments that the lyrics avoid remitting.</p><p>
    Also: The ""new rave"" hype is mostly absurd…for now. Out of guitar-centric insecurity, I've read the right books and am well-aware of the theory that electronic dance music was supposedly the only revolutionary supergenre of the late 1980s and 1990s, and that it may have gotten back-burnered by critics horn-dogging grunge's bummery revisitations, but by the time rave-culture reached my southern U.S. state-university town, more energy was spent calling paramedics, peeing into warehouse ventilation shafts, and leaning against walls saying, ""WHOAH, lover-crust, I am so ROLLing"" to other amnesiac/insomniac rollers than listening to the (purportedly crucial) music. Despite their psycho-festive tempos, Klaxons recordings contain way more analog elements than most rave fodder, and besides, this EP is being released during the months when allergies and sinusitis most complicate party-drug consumption.
    </p><p>
    Whatever: ""Gravity's Rainbow"" is a winning, priss-the-door-down single. In Pitchfork's Track Review section, my colleague Pete Macia declared it double-speed Bloc Party, but the tune equally suggests a Ritalin-snorting Beck after drinking the blood of a garage Scissor Sisters. My initial earn-my-paycheck angle on this review was to declare Klaxons nudgingly fascist and psychopharmacological, on account of their gall re: demanding that I just absolutely have to have constant fun starting now, despite metabolism and world affairs, but these first two wildly gregarious songs call the skeptical listener out as some Vichy-resistance arse. Klaxons' double-shot of mania reveals tinges of darkness anyway: The drums are, like, so violently pounded, and ""Atlantis to Interzone"" knowingly lifts the midriff from Radiohead's dystope-a-dope ""Paranoid Android"".
    </p>
<p>
    ""4 Horsemen Of 2012"" sounds like Ween under Deceptacon duress, and signals the end of the EP's subtlety about the rave business. Which is to say: The first three tracks probably most purely embody what everyone wanted from that phantom menace called dancepunk, which I'd previously considered a press/PR concoction at best, the ""security mom"" of indie (and then major-label) subgenres. Here you get monster basslines, shambolic grooves, primitively appealing percussion, screamed lyrics that vacillate from insipid to insurgent, and a honed obnoxiousness: as much K Records as DFA. I would tout the siren blasts-- there are more on this EP than bleat during the entirety of <em>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</em>-- but yeah, alright, those are kind of ravey.
    </p>
<p>
    The rowdy cover of Kicks Like a Mule's breakbeat standard ""The Bouncer"" is so pissed-off and band-y and live-instrument-based that it plays as more akin to 90s college-rock topical-rage songs such as the Archers of Loaf's ""Power Walker"" than to communal dance music. Just as the Archers hated them some bionic sidewalk pacing, Klaxons are equating being left off the guest list with apartheid, overpouring courage onto a wafer of conviction. As for the remixes, consult the internet for many, many more, and beware that they too streamline the originals, often to the point of being covers, once vocals and instruments are replaced and set to fitter, happier, and more daftly punk'd beats.
    </p>
<p>
    The coming Klaxons full-length, rumored to be overseen by Simian Mobile Disco, might just be the titanic thing that really teaches the indie kids to dance and never look back. Imagine what those two producers might achieve with the Papas-Fritas-channeling-Hall-&amp;-Oates caucasian-funk of (non-EP-track) ""Golden Skans"". Then imagine CMJ charts dominated by Cut Copy, Shit Disco, and Supersystem. But then imagine how their lobotomized mainstream doppelgangers will emerge in some bastardized second generation, inadvertently breeding whole new Cobains who weren't born to boogie, starting the 90s mess all over again, possibly with bitterer choruses and bleaker cardigans.
    </p>
<p>
    Portentous McFootnote: Last weekend, firemen had to extinguish a burning piano at a hipster party here in my supposedly behind-the-pulse, southern U.S. state-university town. I thought, big deal, how punk, how Blood Brothers. But the news story contained a terrifying detail. The encircling throng that cheered the flaming, old-school song machine…was waving (gulp) glow sticks.

    Norway's 120 Days are proponents of the house-of-cards style of songwriting-- from ephemeral elements, they build towering edifices that seem a breath away from toppling. But those structures never topple, thanks to the band's deft hands and measured pace, not to mention the loaded deck from which they're drawing: New Order synths doppler over Kraftwerk's motorik throb. Primal Scream's propulsive electro-rock tangles with Neu!'s gridded tableaux and Ådne Meisfjord's Bonoesque voice. If it sounds overstated, it is-- these guys go big on everything, from the long transitions to the incandescent crescendos. But whether they're hunkered down in a patient whirr or exploding in a fountain of sparks, 120 Days exude audacity, and their U.S. debut's ambition is ratified by its realization.</p><p>
    Some albums work best as sweeping gestures, others as collections of finely wrought details; this one profits from close attention to both. The stately nine-minute burner ""Come Out (Come Down, Fade Out, Be Gone)"" is a tsunami of supple polyrhythms, ectoplasmic synths, and tightly spiraling guitars, moving over inclines and declivities so immaculately graded you scarcely notice them until you're at the crest. ""C-Musik"" spends nearly two minutes setting a murkily glittering stage before the clattering percussion and space-age melody snap on like spotlights, illuminating the dramatic action <em>in medias res</em>. And epic closing track ""I've Lost My Vision (Kraut #1)"" moves like a time-lapsed ice age, a momentous pageant of melt and drift. There's just as much to admire at the atomic level-- how a chiseled synth snarl in ""Be Mine"" launches a contrasting bass thwack; the way the Joy Division-style rock of ""Get Away"" and the springy electro of ""Keep on Smiling"" are ingeniously bridged with a vivid yet amorphous lump of noise; the power-saw lead that pushes ""Lazy Eyes"" just over the top.</p><p>
    Still hardwired into rock is the idea that too much technology effaces the human, a notion that modern electronic rock often endorses with paranoid futurism (cue Radiohead)-- as if the mere existence of samplers portended an inevitable post-human dystopia. 120 Days unravel the ideological tapestry back to its first stitch, where someone figured out how to build a machine that made beautiful sounds. From this clear-sighted starting point, there's no urge to mine the seams where technology fails or to subvert it for meta-commentary-- it's simply a sound source capable of mimetically bolstering Meisfjord's deeply human longings. This is a band that spent a year living and creating in a motor home parked in prohibitively expensive Oslo, because that's where the music was. They wanted something and, more importantly, weren't afraid to be perceived as wanting it, and when Meisfjord sings, ""In a trance, in a trance I could dance this night away"" on the cavernous ""Sleepwalking"", you can discern it all-- the cold wind howling around the motor home, the heat of the band's desire, the special urgency common to young people pursuing lofty ideals, and the conviction that all this technology has the potential to amplify, not suppress, the transmission of human emotion, should humans be courageous enough to try.

    Mat Sweet lives in a world that's interesting to
    visit, but not somewhere I'd want to live. The rainbows are pitch black, it rains blood, and the sun seems inclined to simply
    avoid the place. <em>Lion Devours the Sun</em>,
    his second album as Boduf Songs, is even more downcast than the first, placing
    a greater accent on the drone and quiet noise of the debut.</p><p>
    It certainly creates a stark mood, made all the more intense
    by Sweet's whispering, close-mic'd delivery-- he makes Iron &amp; Wine's Sam Beam sound operatic. The
    liners indicate the album was recorded at home, and it sounds like Sweet was trying
    not wake the baby while he worked on it-- even the noise registers just over the
    threshold of consciousness. This approach yields some amazing songs, intimate
    and in-your-face poetic ramblings that tend to circle back to death. ""Two Across
    the Mouth"" is bookended by the line ""I built a house from my mistakes,"" and in
    between it's a word-painting of malice and paranoia, with an acoustic guitar
    for a canvas.</p><p>
    ""Green Lion Devours the Sun, Blood Descends to Earth"" needs
    little more explanation than its title, built as it is on a lone drum and one
    muted, molten electric guitar that hangs on notes for what seems like ages as
    Sweet sings about blood, clipped wings and black stars. ""27<sup>th</sup>
    Raven's Head (Darkness Showing Through the Head of the Raven)"" is almost
    unbearably quiet and murderous, and the darkness in the lyrics finally spills
    over the top with this passage, possibly about George W. Bush: ""Dumb
    luck/stupid fuck/crowned as a holy king/bless with a rotten tongue/pigs blood
    and sparrow wing spat from a wretched mouth/sweet song of heresy."" As gripping
    as this stuff can be, it can also descend into overkill.
    </p>
<p>
    Sweet sticks to his vision of a world gone rotten from
    the core, a malignant place where noises like the sound of a pick scraping
    strings are actually kind of a relief. His steadfastness is his greatest
    strength and his greatest weakness, but even though it occasionally
    over-ripens, <em>Lion Devours the Sun</em> is
    a good soundtrack for a long, hard brood.

    So by now Air are pretty much the most famous French electro-pop duo ever,
    right? Unless you count Daft Punk, which of course you <em>do</em>, but Air are
    still the most famous French electro-pop duo inspired by Burt Bacharach, and
    nobody doesn't like ""Walk on By"". Yes, this counts for something.
    Indeed, Anglophonic critics have sometimes approached Air as a proxy for
    Frenchness, appreciating not the music's heft, but its kitsch-- unable to taste
    the Chardonnay for all the gooey, gooey brie.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, the usual surrender-monkey jibes are not just flawed
    historically, but also an actual impediment to understanding Air's music. What
    I loved about 1998's <em>Moon Safari </em>and 2004's <em>Talkie Walkie</em> were
    the bold, explosive gestures: the rocket-surfing synths of ""Kelly Watch
    the Stars"", the hair-raising whistles on ""Alpha Beta Gaga"", and
    the Zen-garden detail of ""Alone in Kyoto"". These heroic flashes
    emerge within a recherché setting, yes, but they're only complicated by it, not
    defined.</p><p>
    For all the nouveau lounge finery, Air's best songs are grand, melodic
    voyages. By contrast, the solo debut by Air's Jean-Benoît Dunckel waves enough
    white flags for every soldier in Paris. Recorded while Dunckel and regular
    collaborator Nicolas Godin were working on the recent Charlotte Gainsbourg
    album, <em>Darkel</em> has the spare-time feel of a B-side collection, with none
    of Gainsbourg's breathless charisma. While several of the songs evoke the woozy
    romance of Air's slower tracks, the usual aplomb of Dunckel's day job is
    lacking, so many fans may want to hold out for the new Air album due next year.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, <em>Darkel</em> isn't without its surprises. The record occasionally
    brims with the unlikely early 1970s idealism of solo John Lennon. With wobbly
    piano and acoustic guitar, ""At the End of the Sky"" does ""Instant
    Karma! (We All Shine On)"" as a love song about time travel and rainbows,
    while ""My Own Sun"" imagines no possessions but comes closer to
    ""Oh Yoko!"". On supine piano ballad ""Some Men"", Dunckel
    whispers: ""Isn't it pretty/ The way we're coming?"" Give the man a few
    #1 hits and soon he'll be posing naked with Ms. Ono. Sacre bleh. 
    </p>
    Even
    when Dunckel stays closer to type, here he usually relies on unremarkable
    downtempo beats to support unfortunate space-hippie mewlings. Enviro-mantra
    ""Earth"" opens a cappella before hijacking a Liquid Liquid bass line
    and a synth groove that's a hook and an unzipped Happy Monday shy of Gorillaz'
    far better ""Dare"". Brooklyn-style loft-rattler ""Beautiful
    Woman"" brings, er, additional cowbell and shrugs at the working world
    (yup, French). The crunchy new wave of ""Destroy TV"" is kitsch itself,
    while opener ""Be My Friend"", beatific despite 80s suspense-movie
    flourishes, would probably make the kind of friends who steal your girlfriend
    and occupy your country.</div>"|9498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9498-darkel/|4.7|Marc Hogan

    rock bands, Chavez are better described as the sum of their individual players
    than as the sum of their influences.<span> </span>Sweeney
    and guitarist Clay Tarver trade biting, fractured top-three-strings riffs that
    expertly accumulate and release harmonic tension. <span> </span>Scott Masciarelli anchors the frenetic
    guitars with monolithic bass notes and well-placed silences.<span> </span>Drummer ""The"" James Lo is, as his credited
    nickname suggests, absolutely singular, building layer upon layer of rhythmic
    force and complexity without ever coming off as contrived or showy.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Chavez's debut
    single ""Repeat the Ending"" and album <em>Gone
    Glimmering</em> are a bit scrappier than their sophomore opus <em>Ride the Fader</em>; the angularity of
    Sweeney and Tarver's guitars is a little more obvious, and the vocal melodies
    aren't quite as strong.<span> </span>Still, the
    band's energy carries most of this material.<span>
</span>Standouts ""Break Up Your Band"" and ""Pentagram Ring"" bring to mind the
    best of Smashing Pumpkins, squealing and careening with just the right combination
    of pop and swagger. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    With <em>Ride the Fader</em>,
    included here on Disc Two, the band truly hits their stride.<span> </span>Aside fom Archers of Loaf's <em>Icky Mettle</em>, I'm hard pressed to think
    of an indie rock album that starts off stronger than the one-two punch of ""Top Pocket Man""
    and ""The Guard Attacks"".<span> </span>Quasi-ballad
    ""Unreal Is Here"" is basically a well-recorded Guided by Voices song, all
    chiming guitars and off-kilter melody.<span> </span>""New
    Room"" moves seamlessly from understated, minor-key guitars to one of the band's
    most bombastic endings, featuring some of the greatest drum fills ever laid to
    tape. Throughout <em>Ride the Fader</em>,
    Chavez demonstrate a remarkable degree of restraint and consideration, holding
    back when necessary and giving their best musical ideas room to breathe and
    resonate.<span> </span>While much of the album doesn't
    jump out of your speakers with the same frenzied energy as <em>Gone Glimmering</em>, it ultimately hits much harder.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Non-album tracks are few and not terribly surprising; <em>Schoolhouse Rocks! Rocks</em> song ""Little 12
    Toes"" and <em>What's Up Matador</em> cut
    ""Theme From 'For Russ'"" are kitschy oddities, and the previously unreleased
    ""White Jeans"" is on par with the band's less exciting album tracks.<span> </span>The DVD content, featuring two hilarious
    videos and a slightly less hilarious European tour diary, is entertaining if
    not particularly earth-shattering.<span> </span>In a
    sense, Chavez come off as the opposite of many of today's more career-focused
    indie bands, passionate and serious in their music but humorous and self-effacing
    in their overall approach. <span> </span>The box set's
    minimal, scrapbook-like packaging is thorough and respectful; no self-important
    statement from the band, no masturbatory essay by a big name rock critic, just a
    smattering of photos and album art.<span> </span>I
    couldn't think of a more appropriate tribute to a band that was always willing
    to let their music speak for itself.<span> </span>A
    decade later, it still speaks volumes.

    Crack open the case to Oxford Collapse's latest, and you'll see a boy in swim trunks urinating outdoors (it's a perspective from behind), while the front cover features a pool-hardy protagonist tackling a giant inflatable Noid. The rest of the booklet includes similar pictures of young men who look to be partying way too early for the bleached-out early-afternoon daylight of the photos. Sub Pop has tons of this kind of levity in its back catalog, but it's always the label's dour or plainly emotional bands that get the attention.</p><p>
    Let's hope Oxford Collapse are the exception. There's something apt about these photos of men acting just a few years younger then they should-- on<em> Remember the Night Parties</em> OxC reach for a new, cleaned-up, larger sound while still clinging to the nervous pop-punk that got the band this far. You could even divide the record in half, side one where the group makes nice and gets ready for its close up, and then side two where it revisits its strengths.</p><p>
    It's on that second half where, save for ""Please Visit Your National Parks"", the album's best songs are located. The slow-motion build and airy vocals of ""He'll Paint While We Play"" betrays the boisterous chorus-hammering of ""National Parks"", laying on the melody until it wears out to the point of absurdity before making a triumphant return. Most of the songs are cut from a boisterous jangle and burping bass that's familiar to any fan of 1980s U.S. indie-- especially early R.E.M. To the band's credit, however, it breaks up the predictability with instrumental passages that carry grandiose, pastoral moods instead of just youthful exuberance. At times these shifts don't carry weight: The straightforward strum of ""Loser City"" recedes into formless post-rock drift just to return where it left off, ""Return of Burno"" oscillates between structure and aimlessness interminably, and a trumpet does nothing but announce the end of ""Kenny Can't Afford It"". 
    </p>
<p>
    But then there's ""Lady Lawyers"", 100% pure throat-straining pop, but with bittersweet lyrics  (""We're crackin' champagne because we became/ What we never thought we would""). ""Let's Vanish"" has the same strident sing-along quality, but finds an unexpected grace between its clawing melody and sterile echo. The resistance to growing up is a subtle but apparent theme throughout the record, as best friends roam the planet before getting old and vanishing (""Disappearing in stages makes no sound at all""), or someone faces off with the cops that give resistance but only just for laughs. On ""Molasses"", among the disc's best tracks, there's a run of biological nonsense lyrics and recorder solos before they impart a stern self-examining parting shot: ""You know you're gonna get bored of it after a year/ With your animal ways, you'll fuck it up.""
    </p>
<p>
    It's not just that the back half of the record cultivates familiar ground (as on previous OxC albums <em>A Good Ground</em> and the reckless-but-assured <em>Some Wilderness</em>), but that these songs' familiar emotions still sound fresh. That's thanks in part to a newfound grasp of minutiae that belies their casual delivery-- both an ear for the perfect detail (the homely melodica in ""Forgot to Write"") and a way with a phrase (""Finished ain't the same as through,"" from the same track). ""You should be standing right next to me/ Instead of two feet in front of me,"" singer Michael Pace wails on ""Please Visit Your National Parks"", which could be a metaphor to lost or fallen friends or just an inner monologue when eyeing a girl at a show. But it makes two feet seem unbridgable-- as do the days between Monday and Friday in ""Lady Lawyers"". Only the young make such short segments of space and time seem so insurmountable, but that's part of what makes these ambitious post-collegiate drinking songs sound bigger than life. While <em>Some Wilderness</em> may have been an early peak for Oxford Collapse, you can't walk away from <em>Remember the Night Parties</em> thinking their best work isn't ahead of them. It's a torn and somewhat confused record, but a more decisive one wouldn't have suited them or their subject matter.

    Robbie Basho is the least heralded of the three Takoma musicians who revolutionized the acoustic guitar in the 1960s. John Fahey is a
    legend, Leo Kottke even achieved commercial success, but Basho remains largely unknown,
    as spectral as his music. This reissue of his 1969 album <em>Venus in Cancer</em>
    reminds us that he deserved no such fate. The album sits well next to Fahey's <em>Transfiguration
    of Blind Joe Death</em> and Kottke's <em>6 and 12-String Guitar</em>,<em> </em>even as it
    goes further than either into the spirit realm.</p><p>
    Like his comrades, Basho had a sense of humor about his work, evidenced
    immediately in the amusing cover shot of a woman made up with claw-hands and
    what we can only assume are supposed to be crab eyes accosting the nude, stoic
    Venus. As weird as it is, the image could never be as otherworldly as the
    music. The album kicks off with the title track-- nine-and-a-half minutes of superb
    solo acoustic guitar. Basho mixed elements and styles, using open twelve-string
    tunings to peek at Indian raga from a base in Appalachian folk. The harmony of
    the piece shifts between Eastern stasis and Western motion, and then within
    that Western motion between buoyant melody and foreboding dissonance.</p><p>
    The fretwork is even more dazzling on ""Kowaka D'Amour"", which
    features a hyperspeed mid-section that must have required jaw-dropping
    technique. The playing in the slower movements sounds influenced by the North
    African oud style, bouncing around in a scale and double-plucking notes at
    startling speed. If Basho's guitar playing was beyond impressive, another
    aspect of his sound is likely to rouse controversy: his voice.
    </p>
<p>
    Basho's vocals appear on half of the album's six songs, and there's nothing
    like his singing in pop, folk, or anywhere else. He sings from deep
    within his chest but doesn't project operatically, resulting in a strange,
    elemental tone that lends his florid poetry cosmic weight. On much of ""Song for the Queen"" he sings in long, hanging notes; accompanied by French horn, violin, and guitar, the song's spoken section has a Renaissance meets Shakespearean feel. Basho doesn't bother
    with lyrics on ""Eagle Sails the Blue Diamond Waters"", instead wailing
    wordlessly over fluttering finger work and harmonics, with an assist from
    Victor Chancellor's ""drone guitar.""
    </p>
<p>
<em>Venus in Cancer </em>comes from a place-- part
    spiritual, part cosmic, and part earthen-- that's difficult to define. This singular
    work has been nicely cleaned up and remastered by the Tompkins Square folks,
    and the guitar leaps right out of the speakers with force and clarity, the
    sound of fingers rubbing strings intact. In these days of freak-folk and new
    guitar explorers like Steffen Basho-Junghans and Ben Chasny, this fits right
    in.

The New York City
    foursome has the dubious distinction of arriving both too soon and too late for
    the turn-of-century garage rock windfall that should've guaranteed they'd never
    have to shop at a thrift store again. Their debut single ""A Simple Life"" hopped aboard the Velvets' ""Foggy Notion"" locomotion four years before The Strokes rode the same track to the bank. But with no attendant flock of screaming hipster girls to chase them down the street, the Mooneys were relegated to the niche mod-revivalist party circuit.</p><p>
    By the time the band finally scored a major label deal with Columbia, even
    the Hives were old news, and the unfortunate fate of 2004's glam-glossed <em>Alive
    &amp; Amplified</em> proves that the only thing that's worse than being labeled
    a sellout is actually failing to sell, especially when you have seemingly
    infallible hitmakers the Matrix on retainer. Well, the Matrix proved quite
    fallible, and worse, the wave of negative reviews that greeted <em>Alive &amp;
    Amplified</em> characterized the Mooneys as Johnny-Thunders-come-latelys to a
    garage rock get-down that they helped organize. As if to reinforce just how far
    <em>Alive &amp; Amplified</em> strayed from the Mooneys' mod-punk pedigree, the
    band's current Wikipedia entry actually lists Hanoi Rocks as a primary
    reference point.</p><p>
    Ironically, the one fortuitous move the band has made was naming themselves
    after the two singers from Can-- their Damo Suzuki nod inadvertently scored
    them a regular gig soundtracking Suzuki car commercials. But kids, there was a
    time when the Mooney Suzuki represented something more than just clever brand
    synergy. In 1999, the Mooneys recorded the six-song <em>Maximum Black</em> EP,
    one of the greatest, most rama-lama-righteous artifacts of the modern garage
    rock era. Prior to this reissue, it's pretty much only been available to those
    standing within a 10-block radius of St. Mark's Place.
    </p><p>
    The Mooney Suzuki circa 1999 sounded like how we like to think 60s
    garage-rock sounded: feral, drunk on bad attitude, and powered by distorted
    amplifiers sucking up enough electricity to black out entire city blocks. The
    devastating back-to-back fuzzbombs of ""Turn My Blue Sky Black"" and
    ""Your Love is a Gentle Whip"" honor the MC5/Stooges/Blue Cheer school
    of apocalyptic proto-punk, with feedback fade-outs that last almost as long as
    the songs that precede them. But what made the Mooneys more than just another
    band of mop-topped misanthropes was frontman Sammy James Jr.'s allegiances to
    the participatory tenets of Motown (""Half My Heart"") and the
    paisley-patterned pop tones of the Byrds and Love (""My Dear
    Persophone""). Like a young Arthur Lee, James tempers his tough talk with a
    soft touch; even when the Mooneys are at their most pedal-stompin' petulant,
    his charismatically soulful pipes cut through the noise with impressive
    clarity.
    </p>
<p>
    But the Mooneys' melodic fortitude is further revealed here on five previously
    unreleased tracks from the era. James claims they were initially buried for
    fear of being stereotyped as a mod band, and the ""Taxman"" redux of
    ""Right On"" and Brit-Invasion-by-numbers of ""Tell Me Why""
    support that theory. But James also denied himself a career-best performance
    with the winsome jangle-pop melancholy of ""This Lonely Land"", the
    sort of song designed to follow a particularly painful break-up at a high
    school dance in the summer of '64. If only the Mooneys had brought this tune to
    the Matrix, they could've, if not scored a platinum record, at least cut in on
    The Fountains of Wayne's monopoly on major label-sponsored power pop. Like the
    song's unattainable female subject, perhaps the Mooney Suzuki are destined to
    ""to be the one that no one can love.""

    It would be impossible to mistake Judah Johnson frontman Daniel Johnson for
    Daniel Johnston no matter how many t's you misplaced--
    the latter plays the most uninflected sort of music imaginable; the former's
    songs are as delicate and intricately tangled as stored Christmas tree lights.
    This Detroit-based quintet is quite literally a post-rock band: After they
    finish rocking, they post up at the laptop to make sure they don't wind up
    rocking too hard. There's a fairly standard song at the core of each of Judah
    Johnson's ponderous compositions, but it's always interleaved with and
    bookended by manipulated samples culled from the song itself, so that each
    track flows inward like a whirlpool, sometimes sweeping our attention up in its
    currents, sometimes sucking it right down the drain. Judah Johnson never met a
    meta gesture they didn't like.</p><p>
<em>Be Where I Be</em> is an undeniably <em>good</em>-sounding album, brimming
    with fluid samples, intricate tinker-toy drum machines, carefully
    collaged vocal loops, ironclad basslines chased with generously
    reverbed guitar, spectral harmonies, gently discordant ambience, nervous click
    tracks, and grandly sweeping melodies. Judah Johnson uses this multitude of
    sound to produce spacey rockers like ""Star Struck"", snarled in
    distortion and greased-hog-slick harmonies, and sleepy ballads like ""Loop
    Hymn"", with Johnson's prayerful verses drifting through a bed of clipped
    vocal loops, tiny bells, and languid arcs of guitar.</p><p>
    But undercutting the pleasant sonics is a nagging sense of hollowness, and
    while it's hard to imagine what these songs would sound like without all the
    bells and whistles, one catches a distinct whiff of something overdone. Either
    Johnson's songs are all really similar or he makes them sound that way in
    post-production; regardless, the overzealous pruning makes for a nice but not
    particularly memorable record, and Judah Johnson ultimately comes off as John
    Vanderslice with less personality. The relentlessly overwritten lyrics don't
    help dispel the record's grave, grayish mood. ""Ooh, child, it won't get
    easier, it won't get brighter,"" Johnson sings on ""Little Sounds""
    (take <em>that</em>, the Five Stairsteps!). 
    </p>
<p>
    Similar images of disconnection and confusion blur by in a sparkling haze
    for the duration, and often you can feel them not through the agency of the
    lyrics, but vis-à-vis the music itself. ""Stuck in this minor key,""
    Johnson sings over the music box tinkle of ""Niagara Walls"", as if
    he's fully aware of the groove he's etching into his sound. Every lucid moment
    on the album, like the starry lope of ""Seeing Things"", finds itself
    soon swimming in a lovely murk, pinioned in the unbreakable secret grip of
    Johnson's effects rack. <em>Be Where I Be </em>will sound just fine whenever you
    hear it; the trick is remembering to put it on.
