Anime and video games enthralled kids all over the globe, and author Haruki Murakami was starting to gain traction in the English-language world. And although it might not have been  quite as universal as Pokemon, Shibuya-kei music was winning praise from Western listeners. The genre’s mish-mash of sonic references and samples spanning the entire 20th century caught the ears of non-Japanese labels, leading to the ‘60s-swooning of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3325-pizzicato-five/"" target=""_blank"">Pizzicato Five</a> and lounge-tronica of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1450-fantastic-plastic-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Fantastic Plastic Machine</a> seeing widespread release. Nothing captured as much critical attention, however, as Keigo Oyamada’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/832-cornelius/"" target=""_blank""><span class=""il"">Cornelius</span></a> project, whose 1997 album <i>Fantasma</i> came out Stateside <span class=""aBn"" data-term=""goog_12271128"" tabindex=""0""><span class=""aQJ"">one year later</span></span> via Matador Records. Soon after, the Shibuya-kei movement became oversaturated and its biggest names drifted to new sounds.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fantasma</i> marked the high point for the movement, and has since been celebrated as the style’s ultimate triumph. The Japanese music media isn’t big on “all-time” lists, but when the mood strikes, <span class=""il"">Cornelius</span>’ third proper album always winds up in the top ten. All this canonization has the side effect of making <i>Fantasma</i> feel like an artifact, a musical museum devoted to a scene that could never exist outside of ‘90s Tokyo. Portland-based imprint Lefse’s new vinyl reissue—featuring four enjoyable bonus tracks, albeit songs that aren’t on the album for a reason —reminds that what makes this set of songs special hasn’t aged. Like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2377-endtroducing-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Endtroducing…</a> </i>or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2134-discovery/"" target=""_blank"">Discovery</a></i>, Fantasma took the (often literal) sounds of the past to create something new and exciting, while also ending up a celebration of the process of finding, listening and creating music. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s fitting Shibuya-kei’s finest statement came courtesy of one of the people most central to its emergence. Coming of age during Japan’s economically booming Bubble years, Oyamada had time to play in bands and spend hours exploring Tokyo’s well-stocked record stores. Alongside Kenji Ozawa in the group Flipper’s Guitar, he crafted songs drawing inspiration from all sorts of eclectic sources—the Scottish post-punk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"" target=""_blank"">Orange Juice</a>, Madchester, bossa nova, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23484-the-monkees/"">the Monkees</a>’ movie debut <i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees#Head"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Head</a></i>. Despite a tendency to swipe melodies wholesale, they pushed a slew of new sounds into the Japanese music conscience.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Alongside Pizzicato Five and a few other groups introducing unfamiliar styles, Flipper’s Guitar’s CDs sold extremely well at Shibuya music stores—well enough that they snuck into the nation’s album charts. The media, smelling a trend, called it Shibuya-kei (literally, Shibuya style). From there, new artists emerged, not united by a specific sound but rather an ethos that writer W. David Marx pins as “pastiche and bricolage,” offering an alternative to mainstream J-pop. Oyamada launched a label, Trattoria, sharing music from names such as Kahimi Karie and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32406-hideki-kaji/"" target=""_blank"">Hideki Kaji</a>, and started his solo career as <span class=""il"">Cornelius</span>, releasing two albums that found him caught between singer-songwriter and musical curator. He also starred in a Shibuya-kei-tinged <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r49ex4OkCSk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hair mousse ad</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fantasma</i>, though, promised something different and more daring. Whereas previous <span class=""il"">Cornelius</span> albums launched right into<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NwxrTHwXG0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> sunny horn fanfare</a>, “Mic Check” begins with a faint click and a lot of space. Someone puffs a cigarette, a can cracks open, and somebody whistles a portion of Beethoven’s 5th. Early copies of <i>Fantasma</i> came packaged with earphones, and “Mic Check” quickly establishes why—it’s a producer’s album, one where every sound is labored over and plays a role in the greater journey. Oyamada wants the listener to be adequately ready for this—“can you hear me?” he asks in Japanese—so that they don’t miss any detail, before letting a semi-song bloom around them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From there, Oyamada treats listener to a smörgåsbord of musical thrills. His songs here frequently jump between headphone channels—the dizzying Speak &amp; Spell rock of “Count Five or Six” being a great example of this technique—while going one step further by playing around with the idea of recording music. Side two of the record starts with “Chapter 8 (Seashore and Horizon),” which opens with Robert Schneider and Hilarie Sidney of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/117-the-apples-in-stereo/"" target=""_blank"">the Apples in Stereo</a> performing a very Apples-in-Stereo-sounding song. But before a minute can pass, someone hits the stop button on a cassette player, and Oyamada jumps in with his own interpretation of sweetly sung indie-pop, the sort of number that could easily slide into the Elephant 6 catalog. Then the player clicks again, the tape rewinds, and the Apples come back in frame. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>“Fantasma</i> is a kind of album that only has one entrance and one exit. That is, you can’t listen to if from the middle,” Oyamada told a magazine around the album’s release. As the defining Shibuya-kei full-length, it’s loaded up with references to obscure older music spliced with styles that were, in 1997, fresh—drum ‘n’ bass drills through tropicália on album centerpiece “Star Fruits Surf Rider,” while “Monkey” jams samples sourced from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmer3q2Uu2w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R&amp;B</a> and an old record starring <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Magoo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Magoo</a> to create a playful romp that’s the most stereotypically Shibuya-kei-sounding thing here—but Oyamada wasn’t simply flexing his deep record collection. Sounds reappear frequently across <i>Fantasma</i>, songs referencing one another in subtle ways—early English-language reviews tended to knock <span class=""il"">Cornelius</span> for having too much going on, but Oyamada knew exactly what he was doing with the rush of noises. Everything ends up in its right place, making for a more cohesive and intimate listen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And that’s fitting, as <i>Fantasma</i> celebrates the process of discovery and falling in love with music. Shibuya-kei was built on crate-digging discoveries, but oftentimes could come off as simplistic (or, at worst, trying to be too cool with nothing but some obscure records). But only <i>Fantasma</i> peers into the actual act of listening. Half of the songs here feature no coherent lyrics, but when words do come through, they capture the feeling of being at a concert (“Clash”) or shutting out the world via headphones (“New Music Machine”). Sudden shifts in style even make sense within Fantasma’s walls—the twinkling, childhood collage of “The Micro Disneycal World Tour” gives way to the feedback-soaked, adolescent thrash of “New Music Machine.”  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nearly every song title on <i>Fantasma</i> references an existing musical group, obscure or world famous, but it feels like an act of grateful tribute rather than a hip name-check. With Flipper’s Guitar, Oyamada <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JePfsVUTclA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">straight-up sampled chunks</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"">the Beach Boys</a> “God Only Knows,” but on his own “God Only Knows” he spends the track’s seven-minute-plus run time weaving an intricate pop production inspired by (but never directly taking from) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Wilson</a> (and quoting another Oyamada favorite, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus And Mary Chain</a>). He reveals his intention with the penultimate number, “Thank You For the Music,” which acknowledges all of his musical heroes, along with the listeners who came along for the <i>Fantasma</i> ride, all over a folksy backing track that makes way for a rapid-fire collage of sounds heard over the course of the album...a reminder of the last 50-some minutes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A lot of Shibuya-kei in 2016 sounds extremely dated, and it’s not totally the fault of the music for this. A big draw of the style was how the artist themselves served as a curator for the audience, funneling the forgotten sounds of yesteryear to a new audience. But the internet has completely changed the concept of curation—anyone can become an expert on niche styles with some focused Wikipedia digging, while the idea of finding a new perspective to old sounds has been replaced with “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/23/music-streaming-services-playlister-sam-lee-deezer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">make me a playlist that sounds best while I’m in the bath</a>.” Not to say there aren’t perks to a digital reality—I downloaded <i>Fantasma</i> off Soulseek in 2005, and it’s easier to find Shibuya-kei deep cuts on YouTube now rather than go to the actual Shibuya neighborhood.</p>
<p>But <i>Fantasma</i> distills the spirit and process of Shibuya-kei down to its purest essence and still sound warm and celebratory today. He imagined musical utopia, where genre lines fade easily and where geographic borders can vanish (in 2016, Japanese artists construct their own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21831-iii-imagining-the-life-of-pablo/"" target=""_blank"">imagined versions</a> of albums because of streaming exclusivity). In the ‘90s, <span class=""il"">Cornelius</span> caught attention for a cool sound that earned him comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a>, but it’s the sense of sheer joy and excitement running through <i>Fantasma</i> that still makes it an exhilarating listen today.</p></div>"|21980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21980-fantasma/|8.8|Patrick St. Michel

Recorded at Hackney Road Studios, the aptly-named <i>Piano </i>is not only the most straightforward thing the usually cheeky <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a> frontman has ever released, it’s also the most surprisingly personal. Taylor has always had a knack for embedding wistfulness and bittersweet melancholia into pristinely rendered pop songs. With <i>Piano</i> Taylor peels back any kind of artifice, offering a collection of songs that examine mortality, religion, and the creative impulse itself.</p>
<p>The album opens with “I’m Ready”—a song that correlates the creative process with a kind of expansive emotional openness. “Don’t you know I’m ready?” sings Taylor. “Don’t you know I’m healthy? Nowhere else I’d rather be/Nothing to protect me/No one to defend me.” The song, which is carried aloft by Taylor’s lovely but unfussy piano playing, speaks to vulnerability at the core of the record. The idea of emotional nakedness as reflected by this sort of stripped back, bare-bones performance style is certainly nothing new, but it’s a conceit that works nicely here, showcasing just how genuinely sweet Taylor’s voice actually is. This is particularly true on the record’s two standout covers—a take on Artie Glenn’s “Crying in the Chapel” (a song made famous by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22874-elvis-presley/"">Elvis</a> in 1965) and, even more odd and sublime, a gorgeous version of Crystal Gayle’s 1977 hit, “Don’t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue.” Stripped of its more obvious gospel tropes, the former plays like a love song to serenity, a paean for the peace that comes with surrendering to a higher power or some great love. With his quietly non-ironic dissection of the latter, Taylor gets to the sticky emotional core of Gayle’s song—i.e. the pain of being tossed aside for someone else—and delivers it with devastating ease: “Tell me you love me and don’t let me cry/Say anything but don’t say goodbye.”</p>
<p>Of the original songs on <i>Piano,</i> the most interesting of the lot are oblique examinations of spirituality, all rendered from the stance of the unbeliever. “In the Light of the Room” and “I Never Lock That Door” each unspool with the rhythms of an old country song or a hymn, the divinity at their centers less about any specific god but rather sourced from a sense of love, goodness, and wholeness that exists only in the abstract. (“There’s one place that’s always open/And you’ll find me if you’re hoping/to be mine for all of time/I never lock that door.”) In the liner notes for <i>Piano</i> Taylor admits that many of these songs are meant to “celebrate lives of friends now passed, as well as love for those closest to us, and music itself.” On the elegiac “So Much Further to Go” Taylor balances the urge to bring something new into the world against the crushing brevity of human experience, describing life itself as “a miracle that's hard to bear,” while on album-closing “Don’t Worry” he intones, “If I’m gone away, don’t worry/It is only forever” as if to remind us that life is short, but also sometimes unbearably and stupidly long.</p>
<p>It would be easy to dismiss <i>Piano</i> as a slight addition to Taylor’s discography, but that would be wrong. The quiet humanity in these songs is disarmingly simple at first, but these sentiments creep up on you, giving credence to the notion that it’s in these private moments of contemplation where the narratives of our lives are ultimately assembled. “In the light of the room/Through a window dappled/I was dreaming of you/And of all that’s happened,” Taylor sings on “In the Light of the Room.” It’s the kind of simple moment of observation that <i>Piano</i> is full of. Taylor is no stranger to wearing his heart on his sleeve, <i>Piano </i>takes that notion one step further— it’s as if Taylor is taking his heart out for everyone to see, then discreetly leaving it on your coffee table.</p></div>"|21946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21946-piano/|7.1|T.

For that, it’s underrated. But it’s understandable that Brown would want to retreat from it, as much for its tepid reception as for her  reported state of mind while making it. “I’d never done a sober show in my life until last December,” Brown said; years of chasing social anxiety with alcohol gave way to detox and therapy and the pilgrimage to L.A. all early-to-mid-career musicians take eventually; from it emerged a happier person and, consequentially, a happier album. Who can fault that?</p>
<p><i>Wild Things </i>announces its shinier, almost-perfectly-happy intentions immediately with “A Love Song,” another entry in the long and usually-pretty-great tradition of unabashed pop songs whose self-referential brightness conceals something dark and whose every line—“you’ve opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time,” “you pull me up and tell me how this could end”—works equally well as love or tragedy. Brown repeats the title to the point of insistence, or even defensiveness, like she’s distracting herself from something dark and unspoken.  The ambiguity is crucial; so is the exuberant pop rush.</p>
<p>In abandoning the spikier sound of <i>Anxiety </i>for more straightforward synth-pop, though, Ladyhawke returns to one of the most overcrowded genres going, where thousands vie for maybe a few months of syncs and a lifetime of anonymity. Too much of <i>Wild Things </i>is aimed little higher than that – most audibly on “Golden Girl,” on its polite throb to the Lumineers “hey!”s to the synths that suggest pre-ubiquity <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27831-la-roux/"">La Roux</a> to the distressingly ukulele-like line you can almost smell the lemon Pledge on. It raises two questions: A) whether it’s already in an ad, or just <i>sounds </i>like it’s already in one, via Pavlovian association, and B) whether it’s mistagged and actually by Catey “Brooklyn Girls” Shaw.</p>
<p>“Wild Things” suffers the same; its graceful sweep and confessions so plainspoken (“when you’re almost always lonely, you forget to take it slowly”) mean little when they’re in the service of a <i>Where the Wild Things Are </i>allusion that was dead long before its corpse was fireside-tromped over in the past decade by Spike Jonze and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De30ET0dQpQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alessia Cara</a>. It sounds well enough like 2016 and its trends, but it barely sounds like Ladyhawke. (Ladyhawke was ahead of these trends, too—synthpop most obviously, but also “Paris Is Burning,” which if it were released today would fit right into the crowd of disco licks and vaguely house-ish beats.) For every inspired touch—the backing-vocal frisson and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6-abba/"">ABBA</a>-esque sweep to the melody of “Chills”—there’s an underwritten chorus, or a thin arrangement, or a lyrical complication avoided.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, <i>Wild Things</i>’ thorniness, however intermittent, is its best strength. “Let It Roll” has a clattery, deliberately crowded arrangement, guitar tremors off a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28687-lonelady/"">LoneLady</a> track and Brown’s best vocal mode: tensed-throat stress and tamped-down shyness so fully expressed that they come off as rock-star swagger. Likewise, the disco chorus and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a> synth latticework on “Dangerous” aren’t new, but they at least live up to their title, and to Brown’s older material. But there’s not nearly enough of it. There could have been; before <i>Wild Things</i>, Brown scrapped an entire album that, from press indications, probably sounded a lot like <i>Anxiety; </i>neither she nor the people she said heard it was happy with the results, but one wonders if it was really that bad, or just not commercial and crowd-pleasing enough. <i>Wild Things </i>collapses over the strain to be both.  </p></div>"|21941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21941-wild-things/|5.7|Katherine St. Asaph

On the Brighton band’s debut album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19276-fear-of-men-loom/"">Loom</a></i>, Jessica Weiss voiced some seriously dark, at times even-morbid sentiments, but they were undercut by disarming jangle-pop guitars and sprightly rhythms that made it difficult to take her at her word. Thirty years of conditioning have taught us to associate these sounds with levity—after all, if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a> was mostly just being dramatic, surely Weiss was, too? On their follow-up <i>Fall Forever</i>, though, the band eliminates the disconnect between Weiss’ bleak prose and their delivery system. Any element with even the slightest whiff of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"">Camera Obscura</a> has been replaced by extraterrestrial synths, ominously bowed bass, and guitars distorted beyond recognition. It’s fitting the trio recorded it in a repurposed slaughterhouse, because <i>Fall Forever</i> is the work of a band gutting its sound and watching it bleed out.<br/> <br/> “Vesta” introduces the album with a jolt of warped, digitally manipulated noise, a throat clearing of sorts meant to announce the new direction. Like many of the album’s highlights, it’s thrillingly modern. Fear of Men could have easily pulled a lateral when making the shift from guitars to synthesizers, modeling the record after ’80s synth-pop roughly contemporaneous to the indie-pop of their debut, but instead they set their sights forward. In spirit, “Erase (Aubade)” has the clear, glassy directness of the best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3981-the-sundays/"">Sundays</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7636-the-cranberries/"">Cranberries</a> singles, but the song’s arrangement is glitchy, austere, and modern. The track runs just two minutes, leaving the sense that something crucial has been cropped; it denies the closure of a traditional pop song. The seemingly sweet “Until You” is thrown off course midway through its run by an outbreak of retching electronics, a detour from which it never returns. <br/> <br/> Even the album’s most straightforward dream-pop tunes are battered by sharp, militaristic snares. They create a sense of flagellation that’s driven home by Weiss’ relentless lyrical focus on how much pain and punishment she can withstand, and her repeated assertions that she doesn’t need the intimacy that’s withheld from her. “I’m like an island,” she sings, “I don’t need to feel your arms around me.” Nonetheless, she internalizes the rejection. It manifests itself in a resentment of her own “vile body,” which she describes variously as made of wax and stone, or feeble bones and useless flesh. “I burn my body on the fire/...Breathing deeper now I am free from the crowd/I’m as clean as the shame will allow,” she sings on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18182-fear-of-men-trauma/"">Trauma</a>.” Perversely, it’s the album’s poppiest number.  <br/> <br/> Weiss fills <i>Fall Forever</i> with lyrics like that, fantasies about shedding her skin, becoming one with the elements, leaving the physical world behind and transcending morality. That tight thematic focus means that the songs sometimes bleed together—many feel like minor rewrites of the one that came directly before it—yet the repetition feels deliberate, like part of a calculated do-over. “Without a body, I am free to dissolve,” she sang on <i>Loom</i>. She wasn’t heard the first time around, so it’s as if she’s vowed to repeat herself until the words sink in. This time they do.</p></div>"|21931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21931-fall-forever/|6.7|Evan Rytlewski

Hoping for a smooth transition onto the pop-and-rap-glutted charts, label executives approached frontwoman Shirley Manson and producers-slash-bandmates Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and Butch Vig demanding rapped guest verses and pop hooks. They got the same old Garbage instead: seething, surging, brutal–Billboard potential be damned.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fifteen years later, Garbage have outlasted the naysayers and jilted ex-lovers. 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16606-not-your-kind-of-people/"">Not Your Kind of People</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">couldn’t match the sonic cohesion and thrills of 1995's self-titled debut</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Version 2.0, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">but as the band’s first effort in seven years, it also provided an oasis for all those jaded by EDM's brainless, bro-y #posivibes.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Manson's been happily married for six years (her husband, Billy Bush, co-produced this album<i> </i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and its predecessor), but she’ll never get over misery, her lifelong muse; like all Garbage albums, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strange Little Birds </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">obsesses over, romanticizes, and even celebrates sorrow. On the lead single “Empty,” she towers over her bandmates’ roaring void with arms akimbo, underscoring her woe by way of dramatic, elongated syllables; “I’m </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sooooo </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">empty,” she moans, quaking atop Vig and Erikson's steeled groove. “Night Drive Loneliness,” a ballad inspired by a piece of fan-mail thrust into Manson's hand following a Garbage gig in Russia, develops its titular subject as a sensual ritual. Considered in tandem with the track’s slinky lounge arrangement and boudoir imagery (“I got my high heels/and my lipstick/My blue velvet dress in my closet”), Manson's sighing refrain–“My night drive loneliness comes again and again”–hints at a more hopeful subtext: perhaps depression's just another nameless paramour occupying the passenger seat, another car whizzing by in the night. </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of course, the same could be said for love. Every glimpse of romantic bliss on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strange Little Birds–</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the galvanizing lust on “Magnetized,” the stolen glances of “We Never Tell”–ultimately dissolves under Manson’s fatalist approach to matters of the heart. Although she’s come a long way from the paranoid interrogations of the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3397-bleed-like-me/"">Bleed Like Me</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">e</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ra</span><i> </i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(“I think you’re sleeping with a friend of mine/I have no proof, but I think that I’m right""; “Why Do You Love Me?”) the front-woman still regards love as a rigged game–one she’s happy to play, because she’s got nothing else to lose. Midway through the album, on the funereal choruses of “Even Though Our Love Is Doomed,” Manson soberly proclaims the song’s titular sentiment to deliver a message of hope, not fear: “Even though our stars are crossed/You’re the only thing worth fighting for/You’re the only thing worth dying for.” Elsewhere, “Sometimes” and “Amends”–</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strange Little Birds</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’ respective opener and closer– fashion Manson's philosophy into an olive branch extended to her already-“doomed” loves: “There is nothing you could say/To cause more hurt, or cause me shame/Than all the things that I have thought about myself,” she admits.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strange Little Birds </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">lands less than a year after Garbage’s 20th-anniversary reissue of 1995’s landmark self-titled debut, and while the new album’s sessions predate </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Garbage</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s commemoration festivities, their temporal and stylistic overlap sets it apart from the similarly-styled but unevenly executed band have released over the past fifteen years. Indeed, the  sonic parallels between the two albums are frequent, and far from subtle: “Empty” and “Supervixen” share the same glam-industrial DNA, and the dreary “Blackout” employs the same skittering trip-hop showcased in “A Stroke of Luck.” Despite these superficial similarities, repeat spins of <i>Strange Little Birds</i> ultimately belie an older, wiser reincarnation of that youthful rage, not just a cheap retrospective. Twenty years on, Garbage are still grappling with their demons, but they’re disarmingly zen–even ecstatic– about the battle. With material like this, they’ve got a right to be. </span></p></div>"|21953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21953-strange-little-birds/|7.0|Zoe Camp

Their latest output, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Foiled Again</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, switches up the routine a bit and acts as an epilogue to 2015’s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Foil Deer</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> by serving “Puffer” two ways in addition to a pair of outtakes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To some extent, “Puffer” was the oddity of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Foil Deer</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, trading hyper, zig-zagging guitars for lurching tension. Singer and Guitarist Sadie Dupuis wrote the song while swimming at Puffer’s Pond in Amherst, where she would listen to Kelis and compose tunes inspired by the “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSgp-IIgr4I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bossy</a>” queen. “Puffer” was the result, though as she told Pitchfork, it “came out a little more like krautrock” than R&amp;B. Therefore, perhaps it is an act of fate that “Puffer” would be reborn as two slinky, club-ready bangers, perfect for the crew who has always wanted to hear Speedy at their local dance institution.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first rework is directed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24537-doomtree/"">Doomtree</a> collective member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29337-lazerbeak/"">Lazerbeak</a> and features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33286-lizzo/"">Lizzo</a>, with whom Dupuis (as Sad13) previously collaborated for the <a href=""https://docs.googleblog.com/2016/01/basementqueens.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google Docs-sponsored</a> song “Basement Queens.” “Puffer” a la Lazerbeak isolates Dupuis’ vocals and places them over smooth dings, snaps, and bells. The track drops for Dupuis’ most complicated verse, the sing-song “Poseying in prose again, Mount Toby friends are make pretend.” Lizzo chimes in throughout the song before offering her own verse near the end, bringing a spark of life to a track that was otherwise becoming forgettably hypnotic.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/"">Open Mike Eagle</a> remix is built upon the “So I’m the god of the liars” line, with the occasional whisper of “Poseying in prose again.” The remix could work well as a meditation soundtrack, allowing the listeners’ minds to melt away while they consider what being the god of the liars truly means. It’s an underwhelming way to end an EP, but also allows the two original tracks to truly shine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The title of opener “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18258-speedy-ortiz-death-note/"">Death Note</a>” is an allusion to a Japanese manga series about a notebook that kills anyone whose name is written within its pages. Speedy Ortiz leave the supernatural references at the start; the notebooks mentioned in “Death Note” are tools to work through melancholy. There’s an undeniable heaviness to the track, especially when Dupuis seems to corner the unknown subject and pleads, “How often can I say it until you believe?/They were all love letters/These are all love letters to me.” “A death note can be [a] kind of love letter to yourself, “ Dupuis has explained. This paradoxical logic nails, lyrically, what makes Speedy Ortiz so special: their ability to flit between worlds of darkness and light. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Emma O” continues </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Foiled Again</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s transition into the dark side, especially once one considers that Emm-O is the Japanese judge of the dead. It’s a slow tale of forced time spent with a lover and the ambivalent feelings that follow. There’s a wallowing bit of distortion near the middle of the song like a gray cloud over a cartoon character, just a perceptible reminder that the song is dark. Shortly after comes the line “Your 27, Emma-O you read the masters but you still don’t know about love” which manages to be heartbreaking while also eerily resembling a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"">Belle and Sebastian</a> lyric. Like “Death Note,” which ends with the reassurance that “These are all love letters to me,” “Emma O” ends with the aphorism “I never wanna come for you again/I only want your comfort.” Speedy Ortiz are careful about which lyrics they choose to turn into mantras, and the brief punch offered by those in “Death Note” and “Emma O” are more enriching than “Puffer.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Foiled Again</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a mixed bag. On one hand, there are two great tracks that, for whatever reason, didn’t make it onto </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Foil Deer</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and are now seeing the light of day. Then there are the two remixes, one of which is considerably stronger than the other. Combining these four songs results in a strange listen; the two new songs could stand on their own as singles, same with the remixes. Nonetheless, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Foiled Again</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> confirms that Speedy Ortiz are exploring new territory, and it will be exciting to see how they break their own molds next. </span></p></div>"|21987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21987-foiled-again/|7.2|Quinn Moreland

To him, they both aspire to the same physical and experiential ends. Be it dark room or wooden pew, you should find yourself swaying, head to the floor, singing praises to something beyond yourself. They both function, at some deeper level, in the realm of the sublime and the ecstatic. For the last decade he’s lived in rural Alabama and has been working as a practicing minister when he’s not on tour. While the lifestyles might suggest a radical disjuncture, he thinks that they have to inform each other.  And the music he’s released under <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33773-floorplan/"">Floorplan</a> has been his primary vehicle for exploring the more spiritual ends of his musical identity.</p>
<p>He’s appeared as Floorplan on and off since 1996, but a full album of work didn’t materialize until 2013’<i>s Paradise</i>, a kind of career retrospective for the moniker. Overall, Floorplan is a departure from his epochal minimal techno work, orbiting instead around disco, gospel, and house. He’s also released some of his most iconic tracks as Floorplan, including “Never Grow Old,” which is a template for what you can expect structurally and thematically: exuberantly looped chants and a professorial level of attention to detail, both in production and song craft. And now he’s invited his teenage daughter, Lyric Hood, to co-produce the second full-length Floorplan album, <i>Victorious</i>, a 75 minute long test of Hood’s spiritual dance music.  </p>
<p>His daughter first joined him behind the decks as a sixteen-year-old, and after a spat of touring that included a rather heartfelt closing set at Dekmantel last year, she’s helped co-produce much of <i>Victorious. </i>You can sense the youthful energy she imparts all over <i>Victorious, </i>which benefits from hanging a tad looser than <i>Paradise. </i>It’s eleven tracks are more open, more anthemic, and brighter than much of what Hood has done in the past.</p>
<p>It opens with the six-minute “Spin,” a clinic on structuring a house-music single, fashioned from effortlessly timed cues, jump cuts, and studied progressions. There’s a moment in “Spin” when the beat becomes vaporous and then solidifies, giving you a sense of how physical Hood can make electronic music feel. This physicality is made even more clear in the particularly religious-minded tracks like “The Heavens &amp; The Earth” where a hypnotic reading of the opening lines of Genesis is placed on top of a warm pulsating synth. The line between club and church is forcefully collapsed, and it’s well-argued case study for the spiritual goals for this kind of music.  </p>
<p>For all the seamless transitions within tracks<i><i>,</i> Victorious</i> can feel a little incoherent as a whole. The tracks often end abruptly, closing their loops before they can pleasantly spill into the next moment. There is repetitiveness to the song structures that can feel predictable at a certain point. While you can sense something clunky about how these songs work as as a full unit, individually the tracks overcome the album’s shortcomings by not feeling overcrowded or overproduced. There is something delightfully dispassionate about the way they can reframe and reign in uncontrollable funk in “Tell You No Lie” or slyly weave a sermon in between the thumps of “He Can Save You.” But then other instances like “Ha Ya” can feel phoned in, and somehow the differences between each track can start still feel superficial on repeated listens.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest limitation to it all is that <i>Victorious </i>is in no way a headphone listen. It is constrained by site specificity. If there is a possible maximum-pleasure listening experience it will come from luxuriating in this music very loudly and perfectly articulated over multiple sets of speakers. Perhaps this is true of all dance music, but the thesis of Floorplan is especially grounded in a communal experience. In order to really have that ecstatic event Hood aims for,  you simply cannot be behind a pair of headphones. <i>Victorious </i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is filled with moments that give you glimpses of the club in heaven, but like the afterlife itself, it’s always out of reach, distinct only in brief flashes and in feverish moments. </span></p></div>"|21996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21996-victorious/|6.8|Kevin Lozano

<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33782-margaret-glaspy/""><span class=""il"">Margaret</span> <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span></a> grew up playing fiddle and trombone and listening to early-’00’s Top 40 pop. She hung around in the Boston folk scene after briefly attending Berklee College of Music and eventually settled amongst New York’s singer-songwriter community. Along the way, <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> released a pair of EPs, beginning with <i>Homeschool</i>, a solo-acoustic offering that highlighted her compelling, nasally warble. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Several years later, <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> has arrived with her full-length debut<i> Emotions and Math</i>, a collection of compact grunge-rock and breezy torch songs that mark a decisive departure from the quiet, spare softness of her past recordings. After starting off singing meandering, exploratory folk (see the modernist recitation of<a href=""https://margaretglaspy.bandcamp.com/track/live-know-my-name-to-be-heard-and-be-had"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> “Know My Name/To Be Heard and Be Had”</a>) on her debut <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> has developed a newfound knack for pop hooks and easy melodies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If the songs on <i>Emotions and Math</i>, which follow conventional structures and hover in the two-three minute range, have polished over some of <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span>’s intriguing eccentricities as a vocalist, they also show off her refined focus as a songwriter. On the ’90s-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>-indebted title track, <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> establishes herself as an uncanny chronicler of everyday neuroses, outsourcing her anxieties about a long distance relationship to the numbing tasks of calendar keeping and number crunching “the days ‘till you’re back.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Two tracks later, she channels her anger inwards on the swaggering rocker “You and I,” blaming herself for letting a lackluster love linger too long: “Tonight I’m a little too turned on to talk about us,” she sings in front of a punchy guitar line. “Tomorrow I’ll be too turned off and won’t give a fuck.” <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> asserts her indifference with so much confidence that what might be a moment of despair instead scans as comforting, if not downright celebratory. It’s one of many instances on<i> Emotions and Math</i> in which <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> reserves her deepest empathy for her characters during their lowest moments, when their flaws are getting the best of them and their only sense of reassurance might be knowing that their peers are, more likely than not, fucking up just as mightily.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At their best, these songs share the self-scrutinizing intimacy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a> and the imaginative melodic intonations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"">Joni Mitchell</a>, two of <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span>'s most obvious influences.  Whether she’s writing from the point of view of a parent giving advice to their lonely child (“Parental Guidance”) or acting out imaginary conversations about her deepest insecurities (“You Don’t Want Me”), <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> is a lyricist who can toggle between distanced storytelling and open-hearted self-examination with equal ease.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Compiled from years worth of accumulated material, <i>Emotions and Math</i> suspends time and chronology as the 27-year-old songwriter navigates the dead ends, cheap promises and false starts of young adulthood. One minute, she’s stomping on the fading embers of a failed fling; the next, she’s pining for those very memories she just so happily surrendered. <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> toys with these emotional contradictions, juxtaposing nostalgia and angst against one another from song to song. As she puts it: “Why remember all the times I took forever to forget?”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That line is from “Memory Street,” the album’s centerpiece which finds <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> tiptoeing her way through remembrances of a failed relationship she’s worked hard to get over set to a slow-burning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5033-neil-young-crazy-horse/"">Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse</a> groove. “When I get hungry for the mess we made,” she sings, indulging the cruel thrill and fulfillment in revisiting painful memories and past traumas, “I start walking down memory lane.” Whereas many songwriters might revel in the youthful abandon of such recklessness, <i>Emotions and Math</i> instead treats bad decisions and destructive impulses with compassionate clarity and heartfelt empathy. When <span class=""il"">Margaret</span> <span class=""il"">Glaspy</span> sings that she’s “a woman actin’ like a kid,” she presents the line not as critique but as consolation: it happens to the best of us.</p>

It’s an appropriately angry song with distressing imagery, like a little girl–young enough to have braces–being forcefully shoved to the street by cops. No matter how many listens, the song’s ending will always be sickening and unbearable, as one of the McDonald family’s lawyers, Jeffrey Neslund, describes the murder in plain detail, with just the hum of a bass making it even more ominous. “16 Shots” is not the EP’s best song, but it is its clearest, setting the mood for the entire record.</span></p>

He never rebelled, never played to fashion, never seemed as interested in the dangerous divinations of rock‘n’roll as in the quiet diligence of songwriters from the 1930s and ’40s, who kept short hair and bankers’ hours. He has claimed that he tried to be ironic a few times, but it didn’t work. His first crime is mildness; his second is thinking. He might be your parents’ favorite musician, but your grandparents probably thought he was a pretty decent guy too.</p>
<p>The same qualities that made Simon seem square as a younger artist made him durable into—and beyond—middle age. His second solo album, <i>Paul Simon</i>, invented the literate, introverted style we now call indie-folk, and beat <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDiVtEaAJX8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oscar the Grouch</a> by two years in suggesting that melancholy isn’t a weakness, but a form of insulation against even worse emotional weather. In the ’80s, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> was making kabuki disco albums and Simon’s other ’60s peers—the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">Rolling Stones</a>, for example—were getting lost in the open ocean of too much encouragement, Simon recorded <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16843-graceland-25th-anniversary-edition/"">Graceland</a></i>, an album whose South African sound was both middlebrow and radical, universally likable and yet alien to Simon's typical audience. (For further listening on this subject, visit the compilation <i>The Indestructible Beat of Soweto</i>, released just around the time <i>Graceland</i> came out. It endures.) </p>
<p>Simon’s lyrics, which had always been less about people being free than people getting by, were maturing: He was more aloof now, but funnier, too. Take this, the first verse of a song called “Gumboots”: </p>
<p>""I was having this discussion in a taxi heading downtown/Rearranging my position on this friend of mine who had a little bit of a breakdown/I said, ‘Hey, you know, breakdowns come and breakdowns go/ So what are you going to do about it? That’s what I’d like to know.’”</p>
<p>Twenty years earlier, he would’ve zeroed in on the breakdown and thrown an orchestra at it; now it was relegated to a couple lines on an album with a host of other problems to compartmentalize. Here was someone stepping into the tempered disappointments of being 40 like they were shoes bought just a little too soon. This, he recently told a class at Yale, is when Simon says he was <a href=""http://news.yale.edu/2016/04/06/songwriter-paul-simon-speaks-about-beauty-and-infinity-pleasurable-pursuits"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">finally comfortable admitting he was an artist</a>. </p>
<p>Simon’s post-<i>Graceland</i> career has had its embarrassments, but as with a lot of older, canonized artists, critics seem to take an unusual kind of glee in magnifying them, when, near as I can tell, he bothers the public far less than the rest of his graduating class. There was <i>The Capeman</i>, a musical about the Puerto Rican gang member Salvador Agron, which is one of those sub-middling projects nobody would’ve heard about if it wasn’t coming to us from Paul Simon, but since it <i>was</i> coming to us from Paul Simon, people heard about it a lot more than they needed to. (Several writers—myself included, I admit—have noted how unconvincing Simon is when using the word “fuck,” which he attempts several times on the soundtrack.) There was 2006’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7855-surprise/"">Surprise</a></i>, which found him working with Brian Eno, an artist of related but incompatible genius whose deference to atmosphere tended to wash out the quiet precision of Simon’s songs.</p>
<p><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15326-so-beautiful-or-so-what/"">So Beautiful or So What</a></i> from 2011 was a lot better, and, for an artist of Simon’s stature, surprisingly weird—the sound of an elder statesman settling into his own idiosyncrasies, seemingly unconcerned with legacy or relevance. More than anything, Simon in the ’00s reminds me of the Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso, himself a national treasure whose albums have only gotten leaner and more enigmatic as he keeps making them.</p>
<p>Which brings us to <i>Stranger to Stranger</i>, a compact, often jittery album populated by schizophrenics, disenfranchised teenagers, musicians locked out of their own gigs, and some kind of avenging werewolf coming to kill the rich. I’ve always attributed part of Simon’s enormous popularity to how good he is at teasing out life’s silver linings, at softening disappointment with bittersweetness, regret with nostalgia. Even his saddest songs contain the implicit bromide that life goes on.</p>
<p>Here, things feel less reassuring, more open-ended. Several of the album’s songs—“Street Angel,” “In a Parade,” “The Werewolf”—are bemused and overstuffed, rickshaw rides down busy, unfamiliar streets with people you can’t quite get a read on. Even the album’s friendliest moment, a light, West African-style folksong called “Cool Papa Bell,” is shadowed by lines about “the thrill you feel when evil dreams come true.” (It also contains Simon’s most convincing use of the word “fuck” yet.) Here, Simon’s voice—always boyish, always a little bit distracted—takes on the ominous warmth of Albert Brooks in <i>Drive</i>, who isn’t slitting your wrist until he is.</p>
<p>The shift here is from wisdom to prophecy, from certainty to contingency. Musically, it’s his most adventurous album since <i>Graceland</i>, filed with strange rhythmic kinks and a junkyard’s worth of barely identifiable sounds. Simon’s appropriation of new styles has often had the unfortunate effect of making it seem like he’s domesticating them, making them palatable for the king’s court. (This was, of course, a big debate around <i>Graceland</i>.) Here, he gets as close as he’s ever been to the romantic ideal of kids gathered on a corner banging on what they found in the alley, or of the weird old guy bumping down the road in a wooden cart filled with treasures unknown, from the chimes of “The Clock” and the accidental ambience of “In the Garden of Edie” to the vocal sample on “Street Angel,” flipped and processed to make it sound like a clogged drain. (The sample comes from the Golden Gate Quartet, a proto-gospel group who Simon also sampled on <i>So Beautiful or So What</i>, and who invented what in my estimation is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWxPUwi0bI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the safest anti-depressant on the market</a>.)</p>
<p>Simon has claimed inspiration in part from the American composer Harry Partch, who envisioned a scale that broke up the customary 12 tones into 43, creating slippages and interstices and little gradations of sound that might seem like dissonance to Western ears but that have an oblique, mysterious beauty. Simon borrows a couple of Partch’s homemade instruments here—the zoomoozophone, the chromelodeon—but also borrows a little of his spirit, of a transient life, of quick fixes and no clear plan. My favorite lyrics sound thrillingly unwritten, raw footage of wit in action. Consider it a corrective to a career of smoothing things over: <i>Stranger to Stranger</i> is unpasteurized, mongrel music.</p>
<p>Simon has always been subject to criticism for a certain kind of exceptionalism. Two of his biggest songs, “I Am a Rock” and “Sounds of Silence,” deal with characters who wear their alienation like badges, dark lords of their own personal libraries left with no choice but to turn their faces heroically away from the sheeple who surround them. This was a guy who responded to the news of his partner going to work on a movie in Mexico by writing a song called “The Only Living Boy in New York,” never mind the other 6 million people living there.</p>
<p>As his career wore on, the alienation mellowed into casual arrogance. By 1983’s <i>Hearts and Bones</i>, which Simon himself has acknowledged as an artistic dead-end, he had become the kind of guy who shows up at the party but never has a good time, bored by life but willing to smirk at it, who thinks he’s better than you but is too polite to say so. </p>
<p>We see some of that guy on <i>Stranger</i>, just as we see him on every Paul Simon album—that’s part of what makes it a Paul Simon album. The musician on “Wristband,” for example, who draws an analogy between his own frustrations getting back into the VIP area and what poor people must feel on the brink of a riot. Personally, I see it as satire, the portrait of someone who has mostly lost touch with reality but still has to answer to it eventually. My guess is many will see it as condescension.</p>
<p>Then again, pop has always been nicer to artists who portray struggle than relative ease, more welcoming of emotional engagement than emotional detachment, and increasingly hostile both to intelligence and ambiguity. Simon is all these supposedly bad things and worse. For every one of him, there are 10 guys waiting to stuff him into a locker—that’s how it is, and probably how it’ll always be. “It turns out to be a great thing for me, I don’t worry/I don’t think,” he sings at the beginning of “Cool Papa Bell.” “Because it’s not my job to worry or to think. Not me. I’m more like—every day I’m here I’m grateful.” Anyone familiar with Simon's music knows he must be talking about someone else; his genius is being able to sell the line anyway.</p></div>"|21978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21978-stranger-to-stranger/|7.2|Mike Powell

If the follow-up doesn’t catch, the band tends to go one of three ways: They can call it quits, accepting their commercial decrepitude; wind things down over a couple of albums, continuing to tour the hits as a glorified karaoke act; or, as a last resort, enlist some decorated pop producers who will, in theory, affix makeshift wings and propel them into the stratosphere. So it is with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4966-peter-bjorn-and-john/"">Peter Bjorn and John</a>, a Swedish trio inseparably wed to a pretty whistling melody from 2006, whose songwriting smarts always promised an elusive second wind.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Breakin’ Point</i>, their sixth album and first in five years, attempts to reclaim unpaid dues: written as the trio studied <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6-abba/"">ABBA</a>’s greatest hits, recorded in that band’s old studio, and completed with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6145-paul-epworth/"">Paul Epworth</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14104-greg-kurstin/"">Greg Kurstin</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32713-emile-haynie/"">Emile Haynie</a>, and other major producers with considerable résumés. (The band's Björn Yttling, a notable producer in his own right, worked alongside Kurstin on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5734-lykke-li/"">Lykke Li</a>'s recent albums.) They return a new band: edges planed, eccentricities jettisoned, with a strict emphasis on the effortless hooks that made<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9518-writers-block/""> <i>Writer's Block</i></a><i> </i>click. Song to song, they apply the formula with some success. But three albums on from that breakout LP, <i>Breakin’ Point</i> seems an optimistic title—in 2016, the record arrives almost a decade too late.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That’d be by-the-by if the songs served a purpose beyond mainstream expansion, which they sometimes do. Highlight “Hard Sleep” is convincingly euphoric, full of jubilant falsetto and carnival bombast. Its winning formula—lyrics of waning romance, choruses determined to bounce and soar regardless—is capably reproduced throughout the record. But the song stands out as a rare home-run on an album too blandly ambitious to stick in the memory.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Interestingly, PB&amp;J have history folding their musical ennui into the songs themselves:<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15251-gimme-some/""> <i>Gimme Some</i></a>’s “Second Chance” scans as a commentary on the struggle to replicate “Young Folks”’ success, while “It Don’t Move Me,” from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12874-living-thing/"">Living Thing</a></i>, juxtaposes post-relationship blues with self-referential allusions to a creative impasse. Into that lineage step the title track, with its throwback whistling melody, and “Pretty Dumb Pretty Lame,” a cautionary tale of ballooning egos and one-night-stands—“getting hooked on all the strangers barking your name.” It’s hard to tell whether the latter is a reprimand to industry prima donnas or a jab at the band itself. “If you enjoy what you do, don’t let it ruin you,” is the lyrical conclusion, before an ambiguously apathetic chorus: “Hey, don’t let it get to your head/Hey, others could do it instead.” Along with the decorated producers, the abandoned sonic trademarks, it makes you wonder if <i>Breakin’ Point</i> isn’t a vague experiment in which PB&amp;J try, with maximum self-awareness, to “sell out.”</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If that is the case—and fair play to them if so, they just haven’t quite pulled it off—you might’ve expected a finer focus on why great pop resonates. The songs are skilful constructions: dynamic, propellant, with jingly verses and big, punctual choruses. But PB&amp;J are prone to fluffing the details—take “Dominos”’ unconscionably irritating chorus, or “Nostalgic Intellect”’s make-you-think lyrics: “What’s the point with a phone that smart/If you don’t have a flexible heart?” Clunky words aside, the songs, while uncluttered, suffer a particular kind of too-muchness. “We treated the album like 12 singles, rather than an album,” <a href=""http://b-sides.tv/video/20160518-video-interview-peter-bjorn-john-talk-breakin-point"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">Peter Morén said</span></a> recently, “which of course makes a very good album.” While there’s nothing wrong with that notion, the problem is that when a song’s drama simply <i>exists</i>—when every line throbs with urgency, yet the characters feel less like conflicted people than vessels for indie-pop intensity—the stakes feel low, the conflict superficial. For all its rousing clap-alongs, <i>Breakin’ Point</i> sounds like the lonely work of a band who’ve forgotten how to love their own music.</span></p></div>"|21961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21961-breakin-point/|5.7|Jazz Monroe

Due to his uncanny ability to channel raw emotion through his bombastic voice, Reid picked up the nickname Superlungs at the beginning of his career, turned down the opportunity to front <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Led Zeppelin</a> <i>and</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12181-deep-purple/"">Deep Purple</a>, and set out for a uncompromising solo career. In 1973, at the age of 24, he released <i>River</i>, a near-flawless album of roots, blues, rock 'n' roll, folk and jazz that quickly became a collector's item as it revolved in and out of print for years. <i>The Other Side of the River</i> is a new collection of 11 tracks from <i>River</i>'s session, six of which are previously unheard, and the stunning part is, had they been released with the original LP, it would probably be even more coveted than it is today.</p>
<p>Take, for example, “Avenue (F# Boogie),” a rambling and rollicking number that lazily directs you into the heart of the album. The newly unearthed version has a lived-in, worn-out feel: you can easily picture a gang of long-haired dudes with mutton chop sideburns lounging around a studio, cracking off riff after riff. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11620-ike-turner/"">Ike</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9096-tina-turner/"">Tina Turner</a>'s Ikettes are featured on backing vocals on the track, and their infusion of lush R&amp;B warmth ties the chorus together with spine-tingling effect. It's gorgeous, and in a way improves on the already-fantastic, tighter studio version. </p>
<p>Clearly, having ready access to the talents of the Ikettes never hurt anyone, but the main star in virtually everything Terry Reid ever released is his otherworldly voice. On every song, it bursts forth with equal parts gravel and honey; his soulful belting is effortless and at the same time, sounds almost painful. On “Let's Go Down,” his vocals ride crescendoing blasts of brass up and down the chorus, alternating from a surly talk-sing to chest-bursting wails. The song is a perfect introduction to Reid as Superlungs – even setting aside his virtuoso guitar playing, he's an artist defined by an incredible natural instrument.</p>
<p>The sound on <i>The Other Side of the River</i> is impeccable, but the tracks themselves are obvious rescues from a very deep vault (“Let's Go Down” finishes with Reid cutting the track short, quipping: “Do you want to have another go, or shall we end it here?”), which makes the fact that it sounds like a well-rounded and complete record all the more impressive. Title track “River” is probably the closest to its original, Reid's jazzy phrasings mimicking the languid semi-tones of Nina Simone, skipping atop plucked guitars and minimal bossa nova percussion. It's a quiet moment that demands your attention, and an admirable palette cleanser from the album's more raucous moments.</p>
<p>The record's only major fault is that a few of the tracks are truly just studio noodling – “Celtic Melody,” while still an interesting listen due to Reid's inherent charm, peters out before it really starts, and “Late Night Idea” is basically just that. But given that the bulk of the album manages to rival its original incarnation, these transgressions are excusable, and even the few mostly improvisational outtakes, like the sweet and lilting “Anyway,” prove to be well worth salvaging from the cutting room floor. Light years from a mere slap-dash rarities compilation, <i>The Other Side of the River</i> takes some of a seminal rock musician's most interesting sketchworks and reimagines them as his magnum opus.</p></div>"|21722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21722-terry-reid-the-other-side-of-the-river/|8.4|Cameron Cook

After a slow build over nearly 15 years, in which they steadily massed a fervent hardcore fanbase as a folk-inflected singer/songwriter duo, they metamorphosed in a blink into a massive pop group: instead of dual acoustic guitars and unadorned, harmonic vocals, they teamed up with Top 40 producer Greg Kurstin and adopted an ultra-glossy, near-blinding synth-pop sound. There's a razor-fine line between populist and derivative, and theirs was a calculated risk that paid off—not only was the record critically and commercially successful, it contained some of Tegan and Sara's best songwriting work to date. </p>
<p>After such an impressive and self-imposed breakaway, it's a bit of a shame that their new album, <i>Love You to Death</i>, feels like a focused retread of its predecessor. It's not a <i>bad</i> record—it's well-crafted, with some peaks equal to <i>Heartthrob</i>—but it lacks that intangible magic that so effortlessly bridged the first phase of their career to this new one. It might be unfair to ask them to recapture that moment, <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">when they so recently were able to pull off the double accomplishment of becoming a new band while keeping their longtime fans,</span> but between the bouncy synth hooks and sleek pop production (the band reconnected with Kurstin), you can feel some of the excitement draining away. </p>
<p>Their creative DNA has stayed more or less the same since they first began writing music, no matter the genre trappings around them. At their best, they boil down love songs to their purest, aching essence, capturing complicated emotions in economical, less-is-more lyrical strokes. “You kiss me like your boyfriend,” they coo on the album's lead single, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18168-tegan-and-sara-boyfriend/"">Boyfriend</a>”—a moment of unrequited affection that sears through the buoyant synths and strike at your heart without halting the pace of the party. It's rare to find complex, personal songs about love and relationships matter-of-factly sung from a queer perspective, and in that respect alone Tegan and Sara remain a crucial voice in the pop landscape.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the album, things a just a little less distinct; album cuts like “Faint of Heart” and “Stop Desire” are sturdy, <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">but rely on a certain generic, contemporary-pop sound that could belong to anyone</span>. Another highlight, “100X,” again shows how affecting they can be when they bend the tools of Big Pop to their personal ends. It's another tale of a relationship gone sour, this time with the narrator taking responsibility for the breakdown: “You were someone I loved/Then you were no one at all/It was cruel of me to do what I did to you,” they sing, the words placed simply around a sparse piano melody and some softly glowing synths. There's a straightforward emotional maturity in the moment that has always distinguished their best work.  The minimal instrumentation serves double duty as both stark moment of contemplation and mid-album comedown.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although songs like the Vince Clarke-indebted “BWU” begin to quicken the album’s pulse in the second half, it's not until the second-to-last track that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Love You To Death</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> reaches its bombastic peak, when “U-Turn”'s wet, squelching keyboards punch through the record's firmament and blast off into the stratosphere. It sounds like the Song of the Summer 1986, all pool parties,  tiki torches and BBQs. It's proof that even though they might not capture lightning in a bottle twice, Tegan and Sara are still pushing hard to beat their own expectations, even this far into their career. </span></p></div>"|21952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21952-love-you-to-death/|7.1|Cameron Cook

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> If Dylan’s 1966 double album </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blonde on Blonde </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is generally viewed among his most iconic, it’s because it was his first album to show all the different Dylans in their best light, with appearances from the freewheeling folk singer from the early ‘60s all the way up to the weirdo bluesman he would later become. It’s not Dylan’s only album that plays genre and mood the way other artists use backup guitars, but it’s the one that made them all feel the most coherent, attractive, and maniacally unstoppable.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For the album’s fiftieth birthday, an impressive array of acts have gathered to pay homage to its thin, wild, multiple personality disorder. <i>Blonde on Blonde </i><i>Revisited </i>is a worthy tribute, maintaining the album's original track order and flow while also showcasing the wide-ranging talents of the artists collected.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Unfortunately, things don’t start off so hot.</span> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2974-malcolm-middleton/"">Malcolm Middleton</a>’s monotonous </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matrix</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-soundtrack-meets-hotel-lobby remake of “Rainy Day Woman #12 &amp; 35” at once drains all the brainless fun out of the original while making it sound even more brainless in the process (maybe not </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">everybody </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">must get stoned). Better is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33696-thomas-cohen/"">Thomas Cohen</a>’s subtle, Britpop remake of “Most Likely You Go Your Way And I’ll Go Mine,” refitting Dylan's bluesy kiss-off with a jazzy, laid-back groove. As evidenced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21178-the-cutting-edge-1965-1966-the-bootleg-series-volume-12/"">last year’s fascinating Bootleg Series</a>, however, most of the songs from this era had already been reinvented and torn apart multiple times before being released: the arrangements that Dylan landed on feel definitive for a reason. For the most part, despite the daring, experimental nature of the album proper, the songs that fare best here are also the ones that take the fewest obvious risks. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31339-steve-gunn/"">Steve Gunn</a>’s thoughtful vocal performance in “Visions of Johanna” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29646-michael-chapman/"">Michael Chapman</a>’s intricate guitar work in “Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat” are highlights: examples of artists paying homage to Dylan’s songs not through reinvention but through total reverence. Similarly, after contributing some of the most surprising performances on last month’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21771-day-of-the-dead/"">Day of the Dead</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3475-phosphorescent/"">Phosphorescent</a> shows up with a refreshingly stripped back take on “I Want You,” recalling the early Oldham-isms of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10815-pride/"">Pride</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">more than the underwater country of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17522-phosphorescent-muchacho/"">Muchacho</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Elsewhere, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a>’s austere (even for her) take on “Absolutely Sweet Marie” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32691-ryley-walker/"">Ryley Walker</a>’s stunning “4th Time Around” both make strong cases for each artist’s particular style, illustrating how influential Dylan’s music was for a generation of folk artists hellbent on sounding more like themselves. Like the best of Dylan’s work, these performance sound like timeless standards and unanswerable riddles.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The real revelation here, though, is the closing number. As was the case on the original </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blonde on Blonde</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O’Rourke</a>’s “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” takes up the entirety of Side D (and even outlasts Dylan’s by two minutes). O’Rourke refines Dylan’s epic waltz into a gorgeous acoustic ballad– his hushed, emotive vocal recalling </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Wild, The Innocent</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Springsteen</a> in its quiet intensity. Calling back to the initial recording of the song, when Dylan’s band treated every chorus like a climax, assured that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">this</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> must be the last one, O’Rourke inserts a series of found recordings of city streets, ringing phones, and passing cars between the verses. The opposite effect to the original’s eleven-minute runner’s high, these passages find the artist pausing to look out the window, overwhelmed by the task at hand and threatening to quit before coming back with more to say. It’s a fitting tribute to Dylan at a point in his career when he couldn’t even stand still for the duration of a photo shoot, when “being yourself” wasn’t an instruction to follow but an intuitive instinct. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blonde on Blonde Revisited</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">then, serves an album-length response to Dylan’s comeback. Why just be yourself when you can be all of yourselves, all at once?</span></p></div>"|21997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21997-blonde-on-blonde-revisited/|7.6|Sam Sodomsky

Less than a year and a half later, Mourn’s age is a non-issue: they just sound like an indie rock band in 2016 that wishes it wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sonics are familiar, as is the trajectory. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ha, Ha, He </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">joins the recent ranks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"">Yuck</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18582-yuck-glow-behold/"">Glow &amp; Behold</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30983-eagulls/"">Eagulls</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21868-ullages/"">Ullages</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sophomore albums from similarly promising indie rock bands that didn’t build on their canonical indie rock influences or look towards other genres for inspiration. They simply dug a little bit deeper in the crates and made slight peripheral shifts. Mourn has claimed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4232-throwing-muses/"">Throwing Muses</a> as a major touchstone here, and there’s an unspoken affinity for some of the more ungainly anti-heroes of the alt-rock gold rush: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3776-shudder-to-think/"">Shudder to Think</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/731-chavez/"">Chavez</a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13411-diary-lp2/"">second Sunny Day Real Estate album</a></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Compared to its more jangly, plug-and-play predecessor, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ha, Ha, He. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is all jagged physicality, throwing sharpened elbows and quick jabs.</span></p>
<p>Mourn are adept intimidators: the pummeling opening instrumental “Flee” suggests that Janet Weiss is the focus of their Sleater-Kinney hero worship, while “Evil Dead” nimbly shifts from stuttering riffs to an unsettling chorus of wraithlike chants. They sound confident here, not necessarily trying to adapt to their status as a band that can play festivals so much as exhibit their growth as pure musicians. The songwriting has become just as terse and flinty and it’s effective when Mourn engage with challenging subject matter—“I Am a Chicken” reads like a victim of assault rationalizing after the fact (“Drag me to your cave, grab my feet, I won’t complain...sorry to disappoint you”) while “Irrational Friend” and “Gertrudis, Get Through This!” cynically view love as transactional, a lopsided negotiation at best. It’s all brutal stuff, more so because they’re delivered no differently than anything else than what surrounds it—all of this is just part of the human condition to Mourn.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But for the most part, the unrelenting, grim inscrutability provides little beyond surface tension. Its two-tone album cover, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3759-uh-huh-her/"">P.J. Harvey-evoking title</a> and Albini-style, hands-off recording establishes </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ha, Ha, He. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">as a period piece—conjuring the grave austerity of mid-'90s post-punk but none of the invention. Just about anything that’s novel—jazz chording, serrated yells, tart harmonies—fails to truly flourish within the drab, flat production. Despite the jagged riffs and soberly intoned lyrics, there are few hooks; “Nobody is exempt from the unexpected,” “Little brother, sleeping in a puddle/intricate puzzle surrounds you” are typical of the lyrics that get reiterated enough to assume sort kind of portentous meaning, but exactly <i>what</i> is unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On their debut, Mourn sang in English rather than their native tongue, with the valid belief that they would taken more seriously outside of Spain. While they were saddled by clumsy lyrics, it felt necessary to grade early songs like “Your Brain Is Made of Candy” and “Boys Are Cunts” on a curve: even if they were juvenile, they felt personal, inspired by an teenage vindictiveness that feels timeless and relatable. “Storyteller” and “President Bullshit” make the same points about the overly self-conscious, and thus fraudulent, nature of personal interactions, but their generality seems to be more a result of Mourn’s purposeful withholding rather than any kind of language limitation. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s possible to view </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ha, Ha, He </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">more kindly as a reflection of its already troubled history—though it was finished in 2015, Mourn claimed it was being <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ohmourn/photos/a.623530187669700.1073741828.614631358559583/1006046239418091/?type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“held hostage”</a> by their Spanish label that also doubled as their managers (unfortunately, teenagers getting taken advantage of by their labels is also timeless). Maybe all of this explains the dour, dutiful nature of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ha, Ha, He, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">but that's what Mourn was probably going for anyways. They never wanted to be too young to feel this damn old.</span></p>

<p><i>Black Terry Cat</i> is all about breaking beyond limitations. From mostly keys, drums, and bass, Rubinos and her small cohort bring a funky fluidity to the bright splatters of her debut, and forge a level of inventiveness comparable to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33494-esperanza-spalding/"">Esperanza Spalding</a>'s recent epic, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21575-emilys-devolution/"">Emily's D+Evolution</a></i>. On a day where nothing's going right, the bass and vocals on “Lonely Lover” spiral downwards, an elegant, defeated groove into the abyss. On songs like “Laugh Clown” and “Don't Wanna Be,” Rubinos is a brooding neo-soul singer, yet “Just Like I” is an exuberant but abrasive thrash (“with the same teeth, I smile, I bite you...”) that could be by Shellac if not for her loopy vocal trill.</p>
<p>Rubinos' magical voice gives each of these songs their own distinctive character and magnetism. Tonally, she's a little like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a>'s Annie Clark, with the smoky, inviting warmth of fine red wine, and is as adept at punk confrontation as R&amp;B run-ons. Flickers of desperation color her soulful turn on “Don't Wanna Be,” about trying to get someone to love her, while she hops between consonants on the free-associating “I Won't Say,” which stalls on the piercing tone of an ECG flatline as she recites an extract from Abbey Lincoln's 1966 essay, “<a href=""http://www.ebony.com/black-history/who-will-revere-the-black-woman-405/3#axzz4APi2AmQo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Who Will Revere the Black Woman?</a>”: “Whose hair is compulsively fried, whose skin is bleached, whose nose is ‘too big,’ whose mouth is too loud, whose butt is too broad, whose feet are too flat, whose face is too black?”</p>
<p>On<i> Black Terry Cat</i>, Rubinos poses more of her own provocative questions about how black and brown bodies are contained and valued. And none more so than on the incendiary “Mexican Chef,” a spiky skit about the discreet labor performed by the people of color that “raised America in place of its mom.” Rubinos counts the Latino employees in the back of New York's every restaurant, and the workers absolving others of undesirable jobs, assuring their comfort and assuaging their guilt. “Brown cleans your house, brown takes the trash, brown even wipes your grandaddy's ass,” she raps in a springy cadence, before delivering an even harder blow about the thanks they get for it. “Brown breaks his back, brown takes the flack, brown gets cut 'cos his papers are whack/Brown sits down, brown does frown, brown's up in a hospital gown/Brown has not, brown gets shot, brown got what he deserved 'cos he fought.” With its sharp percussion and infectious polemic, it's like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"">M.I.A.</a> signed to Daptone, which is to say that it's a total KO.</p>
<p>Whereas <i>Magic Trix</i> was heavy with playful imagery, Rubinos gets deep inside her psyche on <i>Black Terry Cat</i>, as she negotiates a world that has prescribed ideas about how she should be, and questions her place outside of it. She rejects the hand that feeds and stabs on “Just Like I,” elasticizing her frustration as she details her dutiful adherence to the system. (“Every single day, living in the places you built for me.”) “How Strange It Is” is an outsider's take on life's arbitrary dividing lines, from time to borders, its curious French cabaret dissolving into nonsense. Amid the overdriven organs of “Right?”, she shoots down someone who shows her “all the things I'll never be,” and on the plainly gorgeous “Laugh Clown,” the mellow haze evoking classic Badu, Rubinos asks, “Ain't got no money, got no job/Got no kids, no country to live in: Who am I?”</p>
<p>But listeners of <i>Black Terry Cat</i> will have no doubt: Rubinos is a unique presence, with a sharp ability to make pressing issues about identity and society into funky, exhilarating music. (The record's only real downsides are a few too many instrumental interludes.) On “See Them,” she rails, “Who are they to come tell me where I'm from and what is wrong?/We know you made up stories page by page, why you lie?” Drawing from so many musical diasporas and questioning the way that different existences intersect, Rubinos' second album is American music with a different story to tell.</p></div>"|21954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21954-xenia-rubinos-black-terry-cat/|8.0|Laura Snapes

(Officially, the Strokes began their slow journey toward oldies stations when Shia LaBeouf wore their shirt in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Transformers</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It also means, weirdly, that they’re no longer expected to be good. A bad record wouldn’t diminish the enduring power of singles like “Last Nite.” In 2014, I met a person who said the Strokes were their favorite band. When I asked how they liked 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17788-the-strokes-comedown-machine/"">Comedown Machine</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the answer was “What’s that?” So it ends up being sort of nice that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Future Present Past</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, their first new release in three years and first EP since 2001’s scene-starting </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Modern Age</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, is only so long as an EP. On 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15230-angles/"">Angles</a></i><i> </i>and <i>Comedown Machine</i>, there was too much going on—and, quite simply, <i>too much</i>. Here, there’s just enough to think about without getting fatigued, as the Strokes continue to toy with the sound of their late period. The concept is present in the title: Here’s what the Strokes </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">do</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sound like, here’s what they </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">did</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sound like, and here’s what they </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">will</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sound like. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The signposts of that classic “Strokes” sound are visible on “OBLIVIUS,” the EP’s immediate stand out: a guitar that sounds like a synth (but isn’t), intertwined with a guitar that sounds like a guitar (and is), backed by precise percussion and knitted together by Julian Casablancas’ bleary, strained voice. There are lyrics about alienation, a maybe semi-intentional, faux-deep </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wolf of Wall Street </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ad lib, and a straining chorus vocal that cannot possibly have been delivered by someone who’s smoked as many cigarettes as Casablancas. (There’s also a remix from the band’s Fab Moretti, which is totally listenable.) “What side are you standing on?” Casablancas sings, which sounds like a challenge to anyone who might pretend the band hasn’t earned its right to screw around.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The benefits of screwing around, of course, could be challenged. “Drag Queen” is the so-called “future”—a more self-consciously “mature” song that opens with a ominous, decayed smear of guitars and continues with the high-concept of Casablancas singing to himself in dueling voices, sort of sounding like a hungover Phantom of the Opera. Halfway through, a Strokes-sian guitar refrain is copy-and-pasted into the flow. It’s a mess, but it’s an interesting mess. “Threat of Joy,” meanwhile, stretches all the way to their pre-fame days, when they sounded just bored and arrogant enough to be sexy. It’s an alternative universe take on what “The Modern Age” might have sounded like if they’d taken a record executive’s advice to slow it down, get a better studio, and play it straight.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If their solo dalliances in the last half-decade have given weight to the idea that the Strokes are more of a business than a living, breathing band, it's still been fascinating to watch them shed their skin and become whatever it is they'll be for the rest of their career. And with the pivot of Casablancas’ Cult Records to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/65726-the-strokes-share-new-song-oblivius-listen/"" target=""_blank"">functioning as a gatekeeper</a> for the living, breathing culture that helped birth the band, they seem like a band that’s very aware of their legacy… as well as how easy it would be for that to stop mattering, should the context no longer exist. Maybe they didn’t mean to become iconic, but it happened, and there are still people who want to see what happens next. </span></p></div>"|21986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21986-future-present-past-ep/|6.0|Jeremy Gordon

Now, 15 years and five albums later, they’ve become <i>Ash &amp; Ice</i>—refined byproducts of their original state, sapped of their frisson. When water hits fire, there’s sizzle and struggle and wreckage. When ash hits ice… well, you just wind up with a somewhat dirty piece of ice. And so it goes with this monolithic record, whose surface soot can’t disguise the fact it’s a little too chilled for its own good.</p>
<p>Since their delightfully deviant debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4424-keep-on-your-mean-side/"">Keep on Your Mean Side</a></i>, The Kills have managed to squeeze a lot of juice from their bare-bones blues roots. Sophomore album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4427-no-wow/"">No Wow</a> </i>delivered a pop punch, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11302-midnight-boom/"">Midnight Boom</a></i> saw them go electro,<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15288-blood-pressures/"">Blood Pressures</a> </i>dabbled in dub and pastoral balladry. <i>Ash &amp; Ice</i> is The Kills’ first album in five years—a delay partly attributed to chronic tendon problems Hince experienced after breaking a finger. And, as if making up for lost time, they’ve returned with an ambitious record that encompasses everything they’ve done before and further embellishes their boombox beats with Brazilian and Afro-pop influences. Clocking in at 50 minutes, it is by far the longest Kills album to date. But while <i>Ash &amp; Ice</i> has the girth of a big statement record, it lacks the focus and purposeful sequencing of one.</p>
<p>The issue with <i>Ash &amp; Ice</i> isn’t that The Kills are slowing down or going soft—the quietest tracks here actually resonate the most soundly. “Hum for Your Buzz” is a stripped-down gospelized serenade complete with organ drones and a steeple-shaking lead vocal from Mosshart—that’s destined to become a crowd-pleasing encore standard in the band’s setlist. By contrast, “That Love” is an affectingly unvarnished piano confessional that evokes the raw simplicity and bald lyricism of <i>Plastic Ono Band</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">John Lennon</a>, while “Echo Home” is a gorgeously sullen duet whose slow-percolating dream-pop atmospherics and tick-tock beat mirror the doomed, dissolving romance playing out in the lyrics. For a band that once carefully cultivated its mystique through <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/The_Kills_-_No_Wow.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mugshot-style photos</a>, mysterious aliases and <a href=""http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/news/63250/0863a198.jpg"">sunglassed aloofness</a>, The Kills have become remarkably adept at telegraphing intimacy and vulnerability. And with Hince's finger injury forcing him to rethink his slash-and-scrape guitar technique, his playing on these downcast songs displays a heretofore-untapped delicacy and sensitivity.  </p>
<p>However, <i>Ash &amp; Ice</i> is an album of quality comedown tracks surrounded by run-of-the-mill rockers that plateau instead of peak. It’s curious, since that the album actually boasts some of the band’s most candid and crushing lyrics to date—from the leash-fastening commitment pledge of “Heart of a Dog” (“I want strings attached/unnatural as that feels/I’m loyal!”) to the tawdry teases on “Siberian Nights” (“I could make you cum in threes/I’m halfway to my knees”) that are soon revealed to be the desperate entreaties of someone scared of enduring another night alone. (And <a href=""http://www.pollstar.com/news_article.aspx?ID=824942"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">according to Hince</a>, that someone could very well be Vladimir Putin.) But the music rarely matches the feverish energy of those words, with the opening mid-tempo march of “Doing It to Death” setting a sluggish pace for the record that’s only compounded by the serviceable Stonesy struts (“Bitter Fruit,” “Black Tar”), drum-machined dirges (“Days of Why and How”), and deconstructed, broken-beat pop (“Let It Drop”). And the precious few shots of momentum—like the gritty glam of “Impossible Tracks” and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/"">Primal Scream</a>-like motorik throb of “Whirling Eye”—slam on the brakes just as they’re about achieve lift-off, or rein in Hince’s ray-gunned guitar blasts right when he’s on the verge of entering berserker mode (“Hard Habit to Break”).</p>
<p>The Kills enjoy a rarefied status in 2016. As one of the few active acts from the early-'00s garage-rock explosion, they’ve transcended their early standing as an MTV2-friendly version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"">Royal Trux</a> to become icons in their own right <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BGKs3uppD1z/?taken-by=jehnnybeth&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">for a new generation of transgressive rockers</a>. But <i>Ash &amp; Ice</i> betrays the challenge of sustaining fresh inspiration deep into your second decade. The blues may have brought Mosshart and Hince together, but <i>Ash</i> <i>&amp; Ice</i> too readily embodies one of the genre’s favored tropes—the struggle to keep on keepin’ on.</p></div>"|21962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21962-ash-ice/|6.2|Stuart Berman

And the British producer Matt Cutler should feel OK about that, because as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29381-lone/"">Lone</a>, he's responsible for quite a few of them. His new one, <i>Levitate </i>doesn't really break any new ground; it reprises ideas (and in some cases, specific synthesizer patches) that he has been using since 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14998-emerald-fantasy-tracks/"">Emerald Fantasy Tracks</a></i>. Yet, to its credit, it doesn't feel redundant. At its best, this short, punchy album feels like a distillation of everything that has made Lone's work great so far.</p>
<p>Historically, Lone's music has tended to toggle between two modes. On the one hand, there's drowsy, lysergic downbeat in the tradition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">Dilla</a>; on the other, a kind of exaggerated rave revivalism, which takes tropes from early-'90s UK dance music and blows them up to gargantuan proportions. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20769-lemurian/"">Lemurian</a></i><i> </i>and <i>Ecstasy &amp; Friends</i>, his first two albums, kept to hip-hop tempos, woozy moods, but the Red Bull kicked in with 2010's <i>Emerald Fantasy Tracks</i>, and he threw himself into house tempos with gusto. The intensity built on 2012's vertiginous <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16578-galaxy-garden/"">Galaxy Garden</a></i>, and then, since everything that comes up must come down—an adage many ravers know all too well—2014's<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19458-lone-reality-testing/"">Reality Testing</a></i><i> </i>slunk back under the covers, balancing hip-hop beats with slow, starry-eyed house and boogie in the vein of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28145-floating-points/"">Floating Points</a>' early singles.</p>
<p>From a title like <i>Levitate</i>, you can guess where Cutler's taking us this time: right back up to the top. It might be Lone's most intense album to date—dancing like a downed electrical wire, with its hooks as immediate as anything he's ever done. Album opener “Alpha Wheel” brings us hurtling up to speed with fat, loud, practically diamond-encrusted breakbeats and a chord progression that sets off tiny serotonin bombs with every syncopated stab. “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18184-lone-backtail-was-heavy/"">Backtail Was Heavy</a>” inhabits similar terrain, balancing rough-cut breaks and detuned horn stabs with a sparkly, Aphex-indebted synth melody. In a curious case of double déjà vu, it's a hardcore throwback through-and-through, and it also uses an uncannily similar synth sound from <i>Emerald Fantasy Tracks’</i> “Moon Beam Harp.”</p>
<p>The shuddering “Triple Helix” and the smooth drum'n'bass roller “Sea of Tranquility” keep the energy levels soaring; even the Boards of Canada pastiche “Sleepwalkers” musters a kind of rhythmic force that the Scottish duo themselves have rarely achieved. <i>Levitate </i>is the shortest album Lone has ever made—just 33 minutes in all, and two of its nine songs are sketch-like ambient interludes. Functionally, it's more like an EP than an album, but that extreme sense of focus works in its favor: There's no wasted effort, and his craft has never sounded better—his beats are Jaws-of-Life strong, his melodies buffed to a blinding sheen. His ingenious way of flipping, chopping and reversing breakbeats recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher/"">Squarepusher</a>’s first two albums, made when the drill'n'bass producer's goofy grin hadn't yet hardened into a smirk. And Cutler manages to find subtle ways to surprise. Both “Alpha Wheel” and “Sleepwalkers” build to their climax and then just drop away.</p>
<p>It all comes together in “Triple Helix”: the sound design, the energy, the optimism. It's wild, disorienting, sugary, hyper-sensory stuff, and it's no wonder that my 11-month-old daughter loves it. Rave has always had an infantilizing aspect, from songs like Smart E's “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odQgfUUegQI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sesame's Treet</a>” to accoutrements like pacifiers and Mickey Mouse gloves. <i>Levitate</i> leverages rave nostalgia to get to a deeper truth: Free your inner child, and your ass and mind will follow. </p></div>"|21938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21938-levitate/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

The cartoon duo treated Rob Zombie and Sean Yseult’s band with deep reverence, and ironically enough, the clip is widely credited as the reason for White Zombie’s initial leap to multi-platinum success. It’s easy to see why the band captured the imaginations of millions of Butt-Heads: Their aesthetic was fully realized—horror and grindhouse-nodding videos and lyrics, Zombie’s booming voice skulking at the front (not to mention his dreads and goggles). It was metal that rode grooves and featured tons of samples. The mid-'90s run of White Zombie that produced their final two albums—their final single, appropriately enough, being their <i>Beavis &amp; Butt-Head Do America</i> soundtrack contribution—was easily the most popular.</p>
<p>But by the time they were playing arenas and getting frequent airplay on TV, they’d been making music for a decade, and their earliest work arguably holds up better than the stuff that made them famous. Yes, it's a total surprise that Numero Group are giving an extremely successful rock band fronted by Rob Zombie the box set treatment—an honor usually reserved for forgotten funk and soul gems. But it also makes total sense. <i>It Came From N.Y.C.</i> unearths records both unreleased and out-of-print while exhaustively telling the band's lesser-known origin story. The box comes with rare photos, archival flyers, a complete archive of their shirts, reproductions of Rob Zombie’s illustrated liner notes, and a detailed account of the band’s history from (full disclosure!) Pitchfork contributor Grayson Haver Currin. Interviews with the band, logged in a beautiful hardcover tome, offer crucial context for this music.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they were a band of art school kids living amid New York City crime and filth. Sean Yseult and Rob Cummings were both attending Parsons in 1984. Yseult switched from ballet to photography after she broke her foot, discovering hardcore and picking up instruments in the process. Cummings moved to New York from small town Massachusetts where he’d been dreaming of the city described by the Ramones and Velvet Underground. The two met in a cafeteria. She had blue-black hair; he wore a Misfits motorcycle jacket. They became a couple and were inseparable for years. They kicked around the idea of starting a band together and ultimately named themselves after a 1932 Bela Lugosi-starring horror film.</p>
<p>What’s quickly apparent from the almost three hours of music on <i>It Came From N.Y.C.</i> is that Cummings and Yseult were the creative and aesthetic anchors behind White Zombie. Guitarists never stuck around long in the band’s early incarnations, which means every one of their first records had an entirely different vibe. Ena Kostabi’s solos on their debut 1985 EP <i>Gods on Voodoo Moon</i>, for example, are a little more flashy than seems sonically appropriate for the band’s ominous, minimal, and occasionally trippy noise-punk underpinnings.</p>
<p>There are great moments on that first 7”—the uneasy melodic sway of “Tales From the Scare Crow Man” and point-perfect opening chug of “Gentleman Junkie”—but the songs themselves show more potential than prowess. Cummings’ growling, raspy screams are perfectly suited to his early horror-aping lyrics, but the frontman billing himself as “Rob Straker” hadn’t found his eventual authoritative Rob Zombie howl. Still, the essentials that would remain throughout the band’s tenure are present on their first recordings: hooks led by Yseult’s bass while Straker shouts nihilistic lyrics about holy mountains, demon clowns, Nazis, butchers, and scarecrows.</p>
<p>The band’s sound was pushed forward on their 1986 “Pig Heaven” single—presented in the box as an EP with four more unearthed tracks from the same session. Their new drummer Ivan de Prume, who would stay with White Zombie throughout the 1980s, emboldened their rhythm section tenfold. They sounded stronger and tighter than ever, and Straker’s psychedelic horror lyrics were becoming narratively connected stories. In their new attempts to make songs trippy or disorienting, they didn’t rely on thin effects pedals—they shoved more details into the margins. (Later in their discography, they proved to be adept with a “more is more” approach.)</p>
<p>The record is bookended by the tinny recording of a ragtime piano—a simple device that both emphasizes their power and shows their interest in painting a more elaborate picture beyond just screams and spilled blood. But while new guitarist Tim Jeffs was an excellent player, his blues-heavy riffs felt out of place in White Zombie. The nearly eight-minute blues groove of “Rain Insane” is one of the most significant departures in the band’s discography, and while it’s definitely an impressive Straker-fronted blues rock jam, White Zombie were much better when they veered toward chaos.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while White Zombie were making records and playing shows, they were operating in the same New York underground as Swans and Sonic Youth. After they dumped Jeffs, they looked for a guitarist with more specific influences—their ad asked for someone who was into the Butthole Surfers, X, and the Birthday Party. They found Tom Guay, who ran in the same circles as Pussy Galore and was clearly more ready to convey dissonance than prowess. On 1987’s <i>Psycho-Head Blowout </i>EP, Straker was becoming a more confident frontman, Yseult’s low-end was becoming beefier and more authoritative, and on songs like “Gun Crazy,” de Prume would bring rapidfire discord. They were becoming more abrasive and unpredictable, Yseult unafraid to dive headlong into sludge while Guay tried on a variety of anxious, frenetic grooves.</p>
<p>Their next record was written, recorded, and released soon after <i>Psycho-Head Blowout</i>. It was hammered out in a practice space that shared walls with people who screamed in the hallways, jumped out windows, and kept pet raccoons. “It was a fucking nuthouse to say the least,” remembers Straker. Those were the conditions behind their debut album—their most bleak and noise-centric outing yet. With no-wave producer Wharton Tiers (Sonic Youth, Glenn Branca), they made their debut album <i>Soul-Crusher</i>, one of the best of their career.</p>
<p>Early on in White Zombie’s recordings, they tried for intimidation, but could never rise above pastiche. With <i>Soul-Crusher</i>, they create a sound that’s fully unsettling, Straker’s multi-tracked voice becoming a one-man cackling, shrieking chorus. There are several moments throughout where saliva seems to be palpably sticking to his lips, making his uncomfortable lyrics borderline unbearable. Guay, again, is essential. Any impressive on-point solos are buried in the mix beneath Yseult’s massive, overpowering sludge. When he’s prominently featured, he’s playing in the wrong key or doing some incredible work with feedback. Several times, de Prume full-on switches time signatures while the band slip in and out of key. The album features spoken-word samples from old horror movies, but by this point the band was its own B-movie soundtrack. </p>
<p>Despite hitting their target squarely, Straker decided to move on. Guay was fired from the band; Straker started crediting himself as Rob Zombie and became enamored with Metallica’s <i>Ride the Lightning</i>. As a result, White Zombie made the abrupt, full transition to metal on <i>Make Them Die Slowly</i>. Everything about the album is more crisp: The lyrics in the liner notes were no longer hand-scrawled with illustrations littering the margins. Guitarist John Ricci, who could rip through galloping riffs and nail precise high-speed solos, was practically the stylistic opposite of Guay. Producer Bill Laswell placed a huge emphasis on Ricci’s guitar and Zombie’s voice while neutering the rhythm section. Yseult’s bass wasn’t the overpowering beast it was on the previous two records, which means White Zombie were deprived of one of their most crucial ingredients. The drums sounded smaller, thin and hollow. The overall effect is especially draining when taken in the box set’s chronological order: the noise dominance of <i>Soul-Crusher</i> followed by the sluggish, monotonous <i>Make Them Die Slowly</i>.</p>
<p>Once again, White Zombie would ditch their guitarist and move on to the next one. Jay Yuenger is the one that stuck—he stayed with the band until they eventually called it quits. Their final record before signing to the majors and moving out to L.A. was 1989’s <i>God of Thunder</i>. On the cover, Zombie holds the severed head of Gene Simmons. The record opens with their cover of the <i>Destroyer</i> classic “God of Thunder,” and White Zombie introduce their version by jacking Kiss' legendary introduction: “You wanted the best? You got the best! Introducing the hottest band in the world!” Their sense of humor and a slam-dunk performance of a Kiss classic bring some much-needed levity to their aesthetic.</p>
<p>In their final stop before “Thunder Kiss ‘65,” <i>God of Thunder</i> shows the band utilizing samples more successfully than ever. (The best one: Between Zombie verses, a blasé voice chimes in to say, “Listen, you fuckers.”) Yuenger’s style in his White Zombie debut offers the midpoint between Ricci’s and Guay’s—he’s impressive, but not overpowering; heavy, but precise. By <i>God of Thunder</i>, they found footing after some thrilling moments in the underground and a couple of creative missteps. But the missteps come with experimentation, and experimentation is mandatory if you want to escape the 1990s as maximalist weirdo rock stars.</p>
<p>Listening back to White Zombie, it's interesting to consider how their music holds up in 2016. Obviously, they're a crucial part of Rob Zombie's horror legacy, introducing the nihilistic hellscape language he would follow in his solo albums and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0957772/#director"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">literal horror films</a>. In an era where Michael Gira is making some of the best records of his life while early works by Sonic Youth and Lydia Lunch are getting reappraised, White Zombie's early presence as a New York underground institution is, on their first 7"", intriguing, and on <i>Soul-Crusher</i>, enthralling. Even their later hits, entrenched in 1990s culture as they were (again, thanks in large part to ""Beavis &amp; Butt-Head""), stands the test of time thanks to riffs like the slide guitar of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0E0ynyIUsg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">More Human Than Human</a>.” This music pummels, and better still, it escapes the trap of self-seriousness that so many metal and noise bands seem to fall into. They had a sense of humor, which came through in their use of samples and in Zombie's deranged carnival barker performances. But even more engaging than the music's heft, humor, or chaos is the narrative that forms across <i>It Came From N.Y.C.</i>—one of a band that played by their own rules, bucking genre conventions and cutting ties with bandmates in an effort to continuously move forward.</p></div>"|21654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21654-it-came-from-nyc/|8.1|Evan Minsker

Their new drummer Ivan de Prume, who would stay with White Zombie throughout the 1980s, emboldened their rhythm section tenfold. They sounded stronger and tighter than ever, and Straker’s psychedelic horror lyrics were becoming narratively connected stories. In their new attempts to make songs trippy or disorienting, they didn’t rely on thin effects pedals—they shoved more details into the margins. (Later in their discography, they proved to be adept with a “more is more” approach.)</p>
<p>The record is bookended by the tinny recording of a ragtime piano—a simple device that both emphasizes their power and shows their interest in painting a more elaborate picture beyond just screams and spilled blood. But while new guitarist Tim Jeffs was an excellent player, his blues-heavy riffs felt out of place in White Zombie. The nearly eight-minute blues groove of “Rain Insane” is one of the most significant departures in the band’s discography, and while it’s definitely an impressive Straker-fronted blues rock jam, White Zombie were much better when they veered toward chaos.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while White Zombie were making records and playing shows, they were operating in the same New York underground as Swans and Sonic Youth. After they dumped Jeffs, they looked for a guitarist with more specific influences—their ad asked for someone who was into the Butthole Surfers, X, and the Birthday Party. They found Tom Guay, who ran in the same circles as Pussy Galore and was clearly more ready to convey dissonance than prowess. On 1987’s <i>Psycho-Head Blowout </i>EP, Straker was becoming a more confident frontman, Yseult’s low-end was becoming beefier and more authoritative, and on songs like “Gun Crazy,” de Prume would bring rapidfire discord. They were becoming more abrasive and unpredictable, Yseult unafraid to dive headlong into sludge while Guay tried on a variety of anxious, frenetic grooves.</p>
<p>Their next record was written, recorded, and released soon after <i>Psycho-Head Blowout</i>. It was hammered out in a practice space that shared walls with people who screamed in the hallways, jumped out windows, and kept pet raccoons. “It was a fucking nuthouse to say the least,” remembers Straker. Those were the conditions behind their debut album—their most bleak and noise-centric outing yet. With no-wave producer Wharton Tiers (Sonic Youth, Glenn Branca), they made their debut album <i>Soul-Crusher</i>, one of the best of their career.</p>
<p>Early on in White Zombie’s recordings, they tried for intimidation, but could never rise above pastiche. With <i>Soul-Crusher</i>, they create a sound that’s fully unsettling, Straker’s multi-tracked voice becoming a one-man cackling, shrieking chorus. There are several moments throughout where saliva seems to be palpably sticking to his lips, making his uncomfortable lyrics borderline unbearable. Guay, again, is essential. Any impressive on-point solos are buried in the mix beneath Yseult’s massive, overpowering sludge. When he’s prominently featured, he’s playing in the wrong key or doing some incredible work with feedback. Several times, de Prume full-on switches time signatures while the band slip in and out of key. The album features spoken-word samples from old horror movies, but by this point the band was its own B-movie soundtrack. </p>
<p>Despite hitting their target squarely, Straker decided to move on. Guay was fired from the band; Straker started crediting himself as Rob Zombie and became enamored with Metallica’s <i>Ride the Lightning</i>. As a result, White Zombie made the abrupt, full transition to metal on <i>Make Them Die Slowly</i>. Everything about the album is more crisp: The lyrics in the liner notes were no longer hand-scrawled with illustrations littering the margins. Guitarist John Ricci, who could rip through galloping riffs and nail precise high-speed solos, was practically the stylistic opposite of Guay. Producer Bill Laswell placed a huge emphasis on Ricci’s guitar and Zombie’s voice while neutering the rhythm section. Yseult’s bass wasn’t the overpowering beast it was on the previous two records, which means White Zombie were deprived of one of their most crucial ingredients. The drums sounded smaller, thin and hollow. The overall effect is especially draining when taken in the box set’s chronological order: the noise dominance of <i>Soul-Crusher</i> followed by the sluggish, monotonous <i>Make Them Die Slowly</i>.</p>
<p>Once again, White Zombie would ditch their guitarist and move on to the next one. Jay Yuenger is the one that stuck—he stayed with the band until they eventually called it quits. Their final record before signing to the majors and moving out to L.A. was 1989’s <i>God of Thunder</i>. On the cover, Zombie holds the severed head of Gene Simmons. The record opens with their cover of the <i>Destroyer</i> classic “God of Thunder,” and White Zombie introduce their version by jacking Kiss' legendary introduction: “You wanted the best? You got the best! Introducing the hottest band in the world!” Their sense of humor and a slam-dunk performance of a Kiss classic bring some much-needed levity to their aesthetic.</p>
<p>In their final stop before “Thunder Kiss ‘65,” <i>God of Thunder</i> shows the band utilizing samples more successfully than ever. (The best one: Between Zombie verses, a blasé voice chimes in to say, “Listen, you fuckers.”) Yuenger’s style in his White Zombie debut offers the midpoint between Ricci’s and Guay’s—he’s impressive, but not overpowering; heavy, but precise. By <i>God of Thunder</i>, they found footing after some thrilling moments in the underground and a couple of creative missteps. But the missteps come with experimentation, and experimentation is mandatory if you want to escape the 1990s as maximalist weirdo rock stars.</p>

The cartoon duo treated Rob Zombie and Sean Yseult’s band with deep reverence, and ironically enough, the clip is widely credited as the reason for White Zombie’s initial leap to multi-platinum success. It’s easy to see why the band captured the imaginations of millions of Butt-Heads: Their aesthetic was fully realized—horror and grindhouse-nodding videos and lyrics, Zombie’s booming voice skulking at the front (not to mention his dreads and goggles). It was metal that rode grooves and featured tons of samples. The mid-'90s run of White Zombie that produced their final two albums—their final single, appropriately enough, being their <i>Beavis &amp; Butt-Head Do America</i> soundtrack contribution—was easily the most popular.</p>
<p>But by the time they were playing arenas and getting frequent airplay on TV, they’d been making music for a decade, and their earliest work arguably holds up better than the stuff that made them famous. Yes, it's a total surprise that Numero Group are giving an extremely successful rock band fronted by Rob Zombie the box set treatment—an honor usually reserved for forgotten funk and soul gems. But it also makes total sense. <i>It Came From N.Y.C.</i> unearths records both unreleased and out-of-print while exhaustively telling the band's lesser-known origin story. The box comes with rare photos, archival flyers, a complete archive of their shirts, reproductions of Rob Zombie’s illustrated liner notes, and a detailed account of the band’s history from (full disclosure!) Pitchfork contributor Grayson Haver Currin. Interviews with the band, logged in a beautiful hardcover tome, offer crucial context for this music.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they were a band of art school kids living amid New York City crime and filth. Sean Yseult and Rob Cummings were both attending Parsons in 1984. Yseult switched from ballet to photography after she broke her foot, discovering hardcore and picking up instruments in the process. Cummings moved to New York from small town Massachusetts where he’d been dreaming of the city described by the Ramones and Velvet Underground. The two met in a cafeteria. She had blue-black hair; he wore a Misfits motorcycle jacket. They became a couple and were inseparable for years. They kicked around the idea of starting a band together and ultimately named themselves after a 1932 Bela Lugosi-starring horror film.</p>
<p>What’s quickly apparent from the almost three hours of music on <i>It Came From N.Y.C.</i> is that Cummings and Yseult were the creative and aesthetic anchors behind White Zombie. Guitarists never stuck around long in the band’s early incarnations, which means every one of their first records had an entirely different vibe. Ena Kostabi’s solos on their debut 1985 EP <i>Gods on Voodoo Moon</i>, for example, are a little more flashy than seems sonically appropriate for the band’s ominous, minimal, and occasionally trippy noise-punk underpinnings.</p>
<p>There are great moments on that first 7”—the uneasy melodic sway of “Tales From the Scare Crow Man” and point-perfect opening chug of “Gentleman Junkie”—but the songs themselves show more potential than prowess. Cummings’ growling, raspy screams are perfectly suited to his early horror-aping lyrics, but the frontman billing himself as “Rob Straker” hadn’t found his eventual authoritative Rob Zombie howl. Still, the essentials that would remain throughout the band’s tenure are present on their first recordings: hooks led by Yseult’s bass while Straker shouts nihilistic lyrics about holy mountains, demon clowns, Nazis, butchers, and scarecrows.</p>

The cartoon duo treated Rob Zombie and Sean Yseult’s band with deep reverence, and ironically enough, the clip is widely credited as the reason for White Zombie’s initial leap to multi-platinum success. It’s easy to see why the band captured the imaginations of millions of Butt-Heads: Their aesthetic was fully realized—horror and grindhouse-nodding videos and lyrics, Zombie’s booming voice skulking at the front (not to mention his dreads and goggles). It was metal that rode grooves and featured tons of samples. The mid-'90s run of White Zombie that produced their final two albums—their final single, appropriately enough, being their <i>Beavis &amp; Butt-Head Do America</i> soundtrack contribution—was easily the most popular.</p>
<p>But by the time they were playing arenas and getting frequent airplay on TV, they’d been making music for a decade, and their earliest work arguably holds up better than the stuff that made them famous. Yes, it's a total surprise that Numero Group are giving an extremely successful rock band fronted by Rob Zombie the box set treatment—an honor usually reserved for forgotten funk and soul gems. But it also makes total sense. <i>It Came From N.Y.C.</i> unearths records both unreleased and out-of-print while exhaustively telling the band's lesser-known origin story. The box comes with rare photos, archival flyers, a complete archive of their shirts, reproductions of Rob Zombie’s illustrated liner notes, and a detailed account of the band’s history from (full disclosure!) Pitchfork contributor Grayson Haver Currin. Interviews with the band, logged in a beautiful hardcover tome, offer crucial context for this music.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they were a band of art school kids living amid New York City crime and filth. Sean Yseult and Rob Cummings were both attending Parsons in 1984. Yseult switched from ballet to photography after she broke her foot, discovering hardcore and picking up instruments in the process. Cummings moved to New York from small town Massachusetts where he’d been dreaming of the city described by the Ramones and Velvet Underground. The two met in a cafeteria. She had blue-black hair; he wore a Misfits motorcycle jacket. They became a couple and were inseparable for years. They kicked around the idea of starting a band together and ultimately named themselves after a 1932 Bela Lugosi-starring horror film.</p>
<p>What’s quickly apparent from the almost three hours of music on <i>It Came From N.Y.C.</i> is that Cummings and Yseult were the creative and aesthetic anchors behind White Zombie. Guitarists never stuck around long in the band’s early incarnations, which means every one of their first records had an entirely different vibe. Ena Kostabi’s solos on their debut 1985 EP <i>Gods on Voodoo Moon</i>, for example, are a little more flashy than seems sonically appropriate for the band’s ominous, minimal, and occasionally trippy noise-punk underpinnings.</p>
<p>There are great moments on that first 7”—the uneasy melodic sway of “Tales From the Scare Crow Man” and point-perfect opening chug of “Gentleman Junkie”—but the songs themselves show more potential than prowess. Cummings’ growling, raspy screams are perfectly suited to his early horror-aping lyrics, but the frontman billing himself as “Rob Straker” hadn’t found his eventual authoritative Rob Zombie howl. Still, the essentials that would remain throughout the band’s tenure are present on their first recordings: hooks led by Yseult’s bass while Straker shouts nihilistic lyrics about holy mountains, demon clowns, Nazis, butchers, and scarecrows.</p>
<p>The band’s sound was pushed forward on their 1986 “Pig Heaven” single—presented in the box as an EP with four more unearthed tracks from the same session. Their new drummer Ivan de Prume, who would stay with White Zombie throughout the 1980s, emboldened their rhythm section tenfold. They sounded stronger and tighter than ever, and Straker’s psychedelic horror lyrics were becoming narratively connected stories. In their new attempts to make songs trippy or disorienting, they didn’t rely on thin effects pedals—they shoved more details into the margins. (Later in their discography, they proved to be adept with a “more is more” approach.)</p>
<p>The record is bookended by the tinny recording of a ragtime piano—a simple device that both emphasizes their power and shows their interest in painting a more elaborate picture beyond just screams and spilled blood. But while new guitarist Tim Jeffs was an excellent player, his blues-heavy riffs felt out of place in White Zombie. The nearly eight-minute blues groove of “Rain Insane” is one of the most significant departures in the band’s discography, and while it’s definitely an impressive Straker-fronted blues rock jam, White Zombie were much better when they veered toward chaos.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while White Zombie were making records and playing shows, they were operating in the same New York underground as Swans and Sonic Youth. After they dumped Jeffs, they looked for a guitarist with more specific influences—their ad asked for someone who was into the Butthole Surfers, X, and the Birthday Party. They found Tom Guay, who ran in the same circles as Pussy Galore and was clearly more ready to convey dissonance than prowess. On 1987’s <i>Psycho-Head Blowout </i>EP, Straker was becoming a more confident frontman, Yseult’s low-end was becoming beefier and more authoritative, and on songs like “Gun Crazy,” de Prume would bring rapidfire discord. They were becoming more abrasive and unpredictable, Yseult unafraid to dive headlong into sludge while Guay tried on a variety of anxious, frenetic grooves.</p>
<p>Their next record was written, recorded, and released soon after <i>Psycho-Head Blowout</i>. It was hammered out in a practice space that shared walls with people who screamed in the hallways, jumped out windows, and kept pet raccoons. “It was a fucking nuthouse to say the least,” remembers Straker. Those were the conditions behind their debut album—their most bleak and noise-centric outing yet. With no-wave producer Wharton Tiers (Sonic Youth, Glenn Branca), they made their debut album <i>Soul-Crusher</i>, one of the best of their career.</p>
<p>Early on in White Zombie’s recordings, they tried for intimidation, but could never rise above pastiche. With <i>Soul-Crusher</i>, they create a sound that’s fully unsettling, Straker’s multi-tracked voice becoming a one-man cackling, shrieking chorus. There are several moments throughout where saliva seems to be palpably sticking to his lips, making his uncomfortable lyrics borderline unbearable. Guay, again, is essential. Any impressive on-point solos are buried in the mix beneath Yseult’s massive, overpowering sludge. When he’s prominently featured, he’s playing in the wrong key or doing some incredible work with feedback. Several times, de Prume full-on switches time signatures while the band slip in and out of key. The album features spoken-word samples from old horror movies, but by this point the band was its own B-movie soundtrack. </p>
<p>Despite hitting their target squarely, Straker decided to move on. Guay was fired from the band; Straker started crediting himself as Rob Zombie and became enamored with Metallica’s <i>Ride the Lightning</i>. As a result, White Zombie made the abrupt, full transition to metal on <i>Make Them Die Slowly</i>. Everything about the album is more crisp: The lyrics in the liner notes were no longer hand-scrawled with illustrations littering the margins. Guitarist John Ricci, who could rip through galloping riffs and nail precise high-speed solos, was practically the stylistic opposite of Guay. Producer Bill Laswell placed a huge emphasis on Ricci’s guitar and Zombie’s voice while neutering the rhythm section. Yseult’s bass wasn’t the overpowering beast it was on the previous two records, which means White Zombie were deprived of one of their most crucial ingredients. The drums sounded smaller, thin and hollow. The overall effect is especially draining when taken in the box set’s chronological order: the noise dominance of <i>Soul-Crusher</i> followed by the sluggish, monotonous <i>Make Them Die Slowly</i>.</p>
<p>Once again, White Zombie would ditch their guitarist and move on to the next one. Jay Yuenger is the one that stuck—he stayed with the band until they eventually called it quits. Their final record before signing to the majors and moving out to L.A. was 1989’s <i>God of Thunder</i>. On the cover, Zombie holds the severed head of Gene Simmons. The record opens with their cover of the <i>Destroyer</i> classic “God of Thunder,” and White Zombie introduce their version by jacking Kiss' legendary introduction: “You wanted the best? You got the best! Introducing the hottest band in the world!” Their sense of humor and a slam-dunk performance of a Kiss classic bring some much-needed levity to their aesthetic.</p>
<p>In their final stop before “Thunder Kiss ‘65,” <i>God of Thunder</i> shows the band utilizing samples more successfully than ever. (The best one: Between Zombie verses, a blasé voice chimes in to say, “Listen, you fuckers.”) Yuenger’s style in his White Zombie debut offers the midpoint between Ricci’s and Guay’s—he’s impressive, but not overpowering; heavy, but precise. By <i>God of Thunder</i>, they found footing after some thrilling moments in the underground and a couple of creative missteps. But the missteps come with experimentation, and experimentation is mandatory if you want to escape the 1990s as maximalist weirdo rock stars.</p>
<p>Listening back to White Zombie, it's interesting to consider how their music holds up in 2016. Obviously, they're a crucial part of Rob Zombie's horror legacy, introducing the nihilistic hellscape language he would follow in his solo albums and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0957772/#director"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">literal horror films</a>. In an era where Michael Gira is making some of the best records of his life while early works by Sonic Youth and Lydia Lunch are getting reappraised, White Zombie's early presence as a New York underground institution is, on their first 7"", intriguing, and on <i>Soul-Crusher</i>, enthralling. Even their later hits, entrenched in 1990s culture as they were (again, thanks in large part to ""Beavis &amp; Butt-Head""), stands the test of time thanks to riffs like the slide guitar of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0E0ynyIUsg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">More Human Than Human</a>.” This music pummels, and better still, it escapes the trap of self-seriousness that so many metal and noise bands seem to fall into. They had a sense of humor, which came through in their use of samples and in Zombie's deranged carnival barker performances. But even more engaging than the music's heft, humor, or chaos is the narrative that forms across <i>It Came From N.Y.C.</i>—one of a band that played by their own rules, bucking genre conventions and cutting ties with bandmates in an effort to continuously move forward.</p></div>"|21654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21654-it-came-from-nyc/|8.4|Evan Minsker

Producer Bill Laswell placed a huge emphasis on Ricci’s guitar and Zombie’s voice while neutering the rhythm section. Yseult’s bass wasn’t the overpowering beast it was on the previous two records, which means White Zombie were deprived of one of their most crucial ingredients. The drums sounded smaller, thin and hollow. The overall effect is especially draining when taken in the box set’s chronological order: the noise dominance of <i>Soul-Crusher</i> followed by the sluggish, monotonous <i>Make Them Die Slowly</i>.</p>
<p>Once again, White Zombie would ditch their guitarist and move on to the next one. Jay Yuenger is the one that stuck—he stayed with the band until they eventually called it quits. Their final record before signing to the majors and moving out to L.A. was 1989’s <i>God of Thunder</i>. On the cover, Zombie holds the severed head of Gene Simmons. The record opens with their cover of the <i>Destroyer</i> classic “God of Thunder,” and White Zombie introduce their version by jacking Kiss' legendary introduction: “You wanted the best? You got the best! Introducing the hottest band in the world!” Their sense of humor and a slam-dunk performance of a Kiss classic bring some much-needed levity to their aesthetic.</p>
<p>In their final stop before “Thunder Kiss ‘65,” <i>God of Thunder</i> shows the band utilizing samples more successfully than ever. (The best one: Between Zombie verses, a blasé voice chimes in to say, “Listen, you fuckers.”) Yuenger’s style in his White Zombie debut offers the midpoint between Ricci’s and Guay’s—he’s impressive, but not overpowering; heavy, but precise. By <i>God of Thunder</i>, they found footing after some thrilling moments in the underground and a couple of creative missteps. But the missteps come with experimentation, and experimentation is mandatory if you want to escape the 1990s as maximalist weirdo rock stars.</p>
<p>Listening back to White Zombie, it's interesting to consider how their music holds up in 2016. Obviously, they're a crucial part of Rob Zombie's horror legacy, introducing the nihilistic hellscape language he would follow in his solo albums and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0957772/#director"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">literal horror films</a>. In an era where Michael Gira is making some of the best records of his life while early works by Sonic Youth and Lydia Lunch are getting reappraised, White Zombie's early presence as a New York underground institution is, on their first 7"", intriguing, and on <i>Soul-Crusher</i>, enthralling. Even their later hits, entrenched in 1990s culture as they were (again, thanks in large part to ""Beavis &amp; Butt-Head""), stands the test of time thanks to riffs like the slide guitar of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0E0ynyIUsg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">More Human Than Human</a>.” This music pummels, and better still, it escapes the trap of self-seriousness that so many metal and noise bands seem to fall into. They had a sense of humor, which came through in their use of samples and in Zombie's deranged carnival barker performances. But even more engaging than the music's heft, humor, or chaos is the narrative that forms across <i>It Came From N.Y.C.</i>—one of a band that played by their own rules, bucking genre conventions and cutting ties with bandmates in an effort to continuously move forward.</p></div>"|21654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21654-it-came-from-nyc/|7.6|Evan Minsker

Maybe that’s a tongue-in-cheek designation for Whitney, the band composed of former Smith Westerns guitarist Max Kakacek and former Unknown Mortal Orchestra drummer Julien Ehrlich. Both were standout members of their former bands; Kakacek never got his due in Smith Westerns, as singer Cullen Omori’s presence soaked up much of the adulation. Ehlrich, who looked about 11 years old behind the kit with UMO, was a long-limbed beast. Whatever reasons for their previous acts’ dissolution and split, the two have found each other and put together something simple but always invaluable: a great warm weather rock’n’roll record. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s hard to talk about Whitney without first talking about Girls, another sweet-and-sour rock duo that both UMO and Smith Westerns spent time on tour opening for. Girls breathed life into earnest folk-rock by writing simple, powerful songs about being in love with life and learning to enjoy the basic things. But they broke up after two albums, and their absence left an empty space that has never been filled. Whitney come closer than any band since.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Light Upon the Lake</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, their debut LP, is a short collection of short songs; half of them are made up of easygoing guitar flourishes, the other half feature woozy strings and slurred brass. This is the Corona of rock records, as Whitney consistently walk that fine line between identifiable and platitudinal. Take the chorus from most recent single “No Matter Where You Go”: “I can take you out/I wanna drive all around with you with the windows down/And we can run all right.” It’s so generically wistful that it could provoke an eyeroll, but it’s delivered with such gentle earnestness that it’s improbably touching. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Light Upon the Lake</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> operates in a universe of endlessly repeatable joy, with a touch of melancholy to keep it interesting. The songs could be about romantic love, but they’re open-ended enough to be whatever you want them to be. </span></p>
<p>The vocals are a harder sell. Ehrlich, assuming vocal duties here, is on the whinier, Muppet-ier side of things. The overall muffled effect of the recording doesn’t help to crystallize anything, either. It’s like someone’s stopped at a stoplight singing their heart out in their car with the windows up and you hear it from the sidewalk. It works great in terms of expressing earnestness but possibly not in terms of pleasantness. I like it because it feels very true. That said, I wouldn’t hold it against you if you weren’t turned off, at least initially.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make it past that, though, and you’ll find most songs to be near flawless on a small scale, working the way a great short story does. The crisp edges of these songs betray people who really know how to play their instruments, but instead of flashing that fact, they back up, writing only in vivid, broad, easygoing pop-rock strokes. “Golden Days,” has all the elements of showiness—a guitar solo, extraneous brass, a singalong—but the song stays small and hummable. Low-key perfectionism is perhaps a humbler virtue than seeking the big, dynamic splash. But it has a way of sneaking in past our defenses and lingering longer—before we know, we’ve been singing that song under our breath for the better part of a year. </span> Whitney might not reinvent anything, but they sound perfect right now, and it’s hard to argue with being in the right place at the right time.</p></div>"|21871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21871-light-upon-the-lake/|8.3|Matthew Schnipper

As familiar as it is, music like this can be deceptively tricky to do right; it requires close attention to storytelling and lyrical economy as well as the ability to not completely overpower these words in pursuit of the occasional rock-out. On their debut <i>Masterpiece</i>, Brooklyn’s Big Thief hits the balance with ease and aplomb.</p>
<p>Singer-songwriter Adrianne Lenker’s pens evocative scenes of people and places, while the band shifts nimbly between lo-fi acoustic and throwback rock hooks, keeping everything noisy and tuneful. They do not reinvent the form and they probably won't be the band to break it, but Lenker has a striking voice and a way with turns of phrase—she is a clear star. She's released albums before—one <a href=""https://adriannelenker.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">solo</a> and <a href=""https://buckandanne.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two proto-Big Thief collections</a> with her main collaborator, guitarist Buck Meek, under the moniker Buck and Anne—but on <i>Masterpiece, </i>the songs sound cherry-picked over a lifetime of writing, the stories carefully compiled. </p>
<p><i>Masterpiece</i> is a scrapbook of sorts, so it makes sense that the name songs—“Paul,” “Lorraine,” “Randy”—tend to be the strongest. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18267-big-thief-paul/"" target=""_blank"">""Paul"" </a>twinkles gorgeously through a wistful, dreamy ache of guitars as Lenker recounts a love that could have been if she hadn't been so practical, but ""Lorraine"" is the kind of scene worth replaying in your mind every night just before dozing off. Atop a lightly strummed acoustic melody, Lenker describes an encounter that under another's less tender eye would seem dirty. But Lenker—seemingly harmonizing with herself—captures the magic of spontaneous attraction, the way some lovers can draw you in through just about anything.</p>
<p>Compared to her stripped-down, pre-Big Thief work—where she sounds quieter, sweeter, slightly twangier at times—Lenker sings with more heft here, prodded by the big sound the band makes when it kicks in behind her. But even when the music veers towards feedback and solos, when it seamlessly shifts tempos and directions on a dime, Lenker’s voice remains the guiding force. On standout ""Real Love,” the band alternates between sparse riffs and bright flourishes of guitar reverb as Lenker likens love to all the awful things—a heart attack, domestic abuse, blackened lungs. She connects it to childhood—how your parents' example of love can screw you up—and it’s a heavy realization that manifests into <i>Masterpiece</i>’s rawest bit of feedback.</p>
<p>What doesn’t work as much are the attempts to make <i>Masterpiece</i> feel overly homemade. The brief opening song, “Little Arrow,” is in a decidedly lower fidelity than the rest of the album, which can be charming but in this case detracts from how vivid the full band sounds. At the end of “Interstate,"" there’s a field recording of a baby repeating the same phrase about liking trucks. These touches to the scrapbook feel like tacked-on reminders of an earlier sound. Listening to Lenker’s early work, where she is definitely more of a folk singer, I’m reminded of a line from <i>Masterpiece</i>’s title track: “There's only so much letting go you can ask someone to do.” </p></div>"|21828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21828-masterpiece/|7.7|Jillian Mapes

Since their debut <i>Gluey Porch Treatments</i> almost three decades ago, the Melvins have barely wavered from the lumbering adamantine groove that made them so hugely influential on countless grunge, sludge, and alt-metal acts. At the same time, the group's nucleus, frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32307-buzz-osborne/"">Buzz Osborne</a> and drummer Dale Crover, have jumped at opportunities to experiment for the better part of their history. Most notably, over the last ten years Osborne and Crover have shaken things up dramatically, leading an ever-shifting array of Melvins lineups as if the band encompasses multiple identities at once.</p>
<p>In some ways, <i>Basses Loaded</i> is the logical culmination of this ongoing musical-chairs policy. Crover and Osborne's preference for lineup fluidity is rooted in the 2005 departure of longtime bassist Kevin Rutmanis (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/845-cows/"">Cows</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4257-tomahawk/"">Tomahawk</a>). So it follows that <i>Basses Loaded</i> features six different people on bass, most of whom have participated in some form of album cycle with the band. (Crover himself plays bass on four tunes, leaving the drum duties on those songs to original Melvins skinsman Mike Dillard, who returned to record and tour behind the 2013 album <i>Tres Cabrones</i>.) But <i>Basses Loaded</i> also signals trouble, with several indications that the band could now benefit from stability as much as it has benefited from freedom in the past.</p>
<p>Perhaps for the first time ever, the Melvins sound unfocused and—worse—like their music is beginning to lack energy. Where you can point to just about any tune in the Melvins catalog and marvel at how Crover, Osborne, and their cohorts convey passion resorting again and again to the band's trademark Sherman-tank rhythms and de-tuned guitars, <i>Basses Loaded</i> mostly just plods. Sure, it's gutsy to start an album off with “The Decay of Lying,” a downtempo skeleton of an arrangement that stretches out to six-plus minutes. But the song is devoid of the textural elements the Melvins normally excel at. It also lacks a climax, which leads you to question whether there's a payoff for the patience it takes to sit through it.</p>
<p>There are lively moments: second track “Choco Plumbing,” for example, with its soaring, '76-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2307-kiss/"">KISS</a>-inspired chorus over an odd-shaped riff. But if anything the song only highlights that we haven't heard enough lately from the Jared Warren/Coady Willis/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5149-big-business/"">Big Business</a> incarnation of the band that's been phasing in and out of activity since 2006—especially in contrast to the hodgepodge of contents that makes up the rest of the album.</p>
<p>To say that the cover of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> classic “I Want to Tell You” doesn't shed any new light on the original is an understatement. It's as if the band were vying to give us all the textbook definition of “throwaway cover tune.” Osborne has publicly professed his love of the Beatles, while their influence on guest bassist Steve McDonald's main band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3549-redd-kross/"">Redd Kross</a> is obvious, so clearly they don't mean to be irreverent. But Osborne's snarling vocal can't help but give the song a sophomoric demeanor. Likewise, Osborne and Crover are fairly avid real-life baseball fans, but their rendition of “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” is so snide you would never guess it. Here, it functions as little more than a novelty item, and barely functions in that capacity.</p>
<p>The real kicker here is that “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” is preceded earlier on the record by “Shaving Cream,” another old-time novelty song with a similar cadence. The song eventually switches into something resembling an electronic loop, but then devolves into outright half-assery when Osborne just shouts “I'm all fucked up / I'm all fucked up” over and over. “Planet Destructor” features the otherwise extraordinarily inventive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11056-trevor-dunn/"">Trevor Dunn</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2848-mr-bungle/"">Mr. Bungle</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1451-fantomas/"" target=""_blank"">Fantômas</a>, Trio-Convulsant), who just absentmindedly plays a mismatched walking bassline over the verse as if he'd been playing along with the wrong tune the whole time. The gag is revealed when the whole band shifts into full-on jazz halfway through the song. By then, it's too late. </p>
<p>Such moves might elicit lukewarm chuckles if they were coming from a band of teenagers for an <i>audience</i> of teenagers, but from seasoned veterans with a dedicated following they reek of being low on ideas. Only the warped psychedelia of “Maybe I Am Amused,” which features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>'s Krist Novoselic, legitimately goes down avenues the band hasn't explored before. Novoselic's accordion injects shades of Eastern gypsy folk music and singer/songwriter folk into the Melvins sound, reminding us that the Melvins have remarkable range given how doggedly they've stuck to their guns.</p>
<p>With its variations in mood, tone, and personnel, <i>Basses Loaded</i> plays more like compilation of B-sides culled from multiple recording sessions spanning several years. That's not actually the case, but the album's lack of flow—and in some cases, lack of point—suggests that for this group with its vitality still well intact after 30-plus years, a re-focusing is probably in order after a very fruitful run of creative detours.</p></div>"|21959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21959-basses-loaded/|5.5|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

Earlier this year, his first famous act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"">Wolf Parade </a>announced that the band was reuniting, first with </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/65430-wolf-parade-play-first-concert-in-five-years-watch/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a secret show</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and then </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21948-ep-4/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">by dropping their first recording of new music</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in five years. And now he’s followed that development with the release of his latest effort under the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28467-moonface/"">Moonface</a> name, the fully electrified </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">My Best Human Face</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Considering that his last two records relied entirely on piano, Krug’s lyrics and his wearied moan—a nicely distinctive voice to be sure, but one with limited range and an ability to grate on overexposure—they turned out to be surprisingly strong, particularly the full-length </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Julia</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Despite the limited instrumentation, on each he made great use of both depth-adding vocal overdubs and ruminative, carefully considered piano accompaniments showing not a rock musician playing songs but a trained pianist uncovering notes. </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">My Best Human Face</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, however, Krug has returned to traditional keyboard-driven rock, and in offering a new electric version of the previous EP’s title-track ode to Montreal “City Wrecker,” he implicitly asks his listeners to assess the results. The original “City Wrecker” was emotional centerpiece of that release; looking back on Krug’s time spent in Montreal and his somewhat anguished decision to leave, it worked quite well in the cold and stark context of piano and voice. However, with Krug’s decision to repeat the track here he does himself a bit of a disservice, as his chosen ornamentation for it in a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Twin Shadow</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-y imaginary-'80s slow burn removes some of the heft of the song and makes you speculate on the seriousness of its sentimentality in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Elsewhere, the rock contrivances work better. Lead single “Risto’s Riff” charges out of the gate with a pounding four-on-the-floor rhythm and sinewy guitar that carry <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a>-style urgency. It's so immediate that you are compelled to shout along with the chorus even as you realize it hinges on the half-hilarious, half-ridiculous rallying cry “At least I'm not a photographer!” On “Ugly Flower Pretty Vase,” he marries a tight drum-and-bass rhythm to snappy, minimal Britt Daniel guitar. And “Them Call Themselves Old Punks” nails the cresting payoff that “City Wrecker” strived for.</span></p>
<p> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately, the brief seven-song album neither starts nor ends well, bookended by two dirges. Opener “The Nightclub Artiste” feels like a textbook example of when Krug takes too much time on a slow song going nowhere, putting too much emphasis on a voice that just isn’t dynamic enough. Plodding closer “The Queen of Both Darkness and Light” is even worse, sounding like exit music that plays over credits while an audience exits a theatre. The fact that it clocks in at a baffling seven minutes—the longest song on the record—makes it seem like Krug must be hearing something the rest of us are not.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then there are Krug's way with lyrics, which can be as divisive as his voice. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s no question he puts painstaking effort into telling stories rather than singing songs, but there are times when is choices are so off-putting it's hard not to do a double-take.  Take the aforementioned “At least I'm not a photographer” in “Risto’s Riff,” or the equally awkward “There’s nothing punk about that” refrain in “Them Call Themselves Old Punks.”  Both moments don't feel witty or unorthodox as they do just awkward, like chunky square pegs jammed into the round holes of standard rock songwriting.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When Krug sticks to his strengths—off-the-beaten-path keyboard-driven rock n’ roll, with taut, wiry tunes that match his voice and wry wit—he generally succeeds. But his tendency to slow it down and draw it out leads him to take risks that often don’t pay off. He hit a decent payday on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Julia with Blue Jeans On</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, but already that formula delivered diminished returns on its successor </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">City Wrecker EP</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. And here now on his electric return, even less so.</span></p></div>"|21977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21977-my-best-human-face/|5.9|Benjamin Scheim

Call it </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">music—a nostalgic throwback to a time when pop culture was loaded with images of palm-treed pavements, side-held pistols and fingers curled into a ‘W’ that comfortably files alongside Kendrick Lamar and DJ Mustard’s modernized takes.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Payroll’s a member of Doughboyz Cashout, whose contract with Jeezy’s CTE World imprint has more or less come to nothing, but the group has countered the stasis with concrete-tough mixtapes that bite like the Michigan winter. On </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Big Bossin’ Vol 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Cardo brings in the sun. Behind the boards on all 18 tracks, his beats are built to feel like westside classics, with melodic synthesizers, silky vocoders, sour whistles, James Worthy-sized handclaps and female background vocals.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The emcee proves the perfect foil for Cardo’s grooves. His relaxed flow is slowed a couple of knots as he sinks into the beats, evoking the swagger of Too $hort and the smoothness of the late Mac Dre–if the two West Coast legends had been compelled to rap about selling drugs on every song. Pitching himself as a rags-to-riches neighborhood baron, Payroll chronicles a life of drug deals, bright jewels and warm pistols. But </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Big Bossin’ Vol 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is more self-aware pastiche than hard-boiled realism. There’s no creeping menace, ten crack commandments, or cutting moral center. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The outline might be familiar, but Payroll brings his own literary deftness. His fluid rapping is matched with a close eye for detail and sharp turn of phrase. “Sell Something” sees him lay out an origin story as he recalls finding an eighth-ounce of cocaine at age 15: “It was like the crack gods were like, ‘Here young dog’,” he spits wryly. On “Day in the Life,” he recycles the concept of Ice Cube’s “It Was a Good Day,” replacing the basketball games and Goodyear Blimp with police sightings and handguns. Moving from the mundanity of his morning routine, to the tension of almost gunning down two innocents, Payroll’s storytelling paints pictures in clear technicolor.</span></p>

The beatmaker recycles the opulent keys and fat bassline previously gifted to Nef the Pharaoh on pop number “Betta Run.” In Payroll’s hands, it’s reimagined as a brash hustler’s anthem. The rapper plays the grinning Don, laying out by his pool in the Cali sun, counting the fruits of the come-up. It’s a sound as timeless as a Bukowski novel; as iconic as the Hollywood sign.

The group's lineup was constantly churning, and because it included producer J Dilla—one of hip-hop's most revered saints—in its ranks, they've become peculiar cult figures: frequently referenced, yet largely unknown. The group now consists of sole original surviving member T3 and longtime SV producer Young RJ, but it has variously boasted the presence of Detroit wordsmith Elzhi and J Dilla's younger brother, Illa J and gone through name changes (weeks after their official debut was released in 2000, they released quasi-album </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Best Kept Secret</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as J-88). But there is one combination—the OG trio of T3, Baatin, and Jay Dee (as Dilla was primarily known then)—that stands as the Supremes with Diana Ross, Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes featuring Teddy Pendergrass. And with the </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fan-Tas-Tic: A Jay-Dee Production </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">box set, we're given the most concise and thorough presentation of the group's formative years ever released.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fan-Tas-Tic </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">box set is sourced mostly from the the group's two most widely lauded efforts—</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fan-Tas-Tic, Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fantastic, Vol. 2. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Both</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">achieved holy-grail status in part due to their scarcity, in the days when music was passed hand-to-hand and dubs of dubs were of ever-decreasing quality. The majority of people who heard the first two Slum Village records in the early days were hearing corrupted versions full of hiss and distortion that actually aided Dilla's warm grooves and the rappers' frayed and imperfect vocal performances. All of the songs were recorded in Dilla's basement on a DAT machine, which meant that the group had to do their songs in one take. They only had two mics—even ad-libs and hooks were done in real time. Furthermore, the entire debut album was made over the course of a week, sandwiched in between Dilla's growing responsibilities and rising renown as a producer for acts like the Pharcyde and A Tribe Called Quest. This imbued their early recording with a genuine garage-band quality—and even after they signed to A&amp;M Records for their second project, they still recorded from the same location, bringing acts from the both coasts to in Dilla's Conant Gardens basement.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In hindsight,<b> </b>Dilla was the star of Slum Village, but that message was never broadcast through the releases—and it's great to hear Dilla's music outside of the idol worship that has sprung up around him following his 2006 death. Hearing full swaths of Dilla productions where his music is foundational but not central is almost unthinkable today. Even though this set is subtitled </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A Jay-Dee Production</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, it skips the heavy-handed approach of 2012's </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rebirth of Detroit</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> tribute or of his many reissued  digital artifacts, which tend to get weighed down by their own sense of of historical importance. On </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fan-Tas-Tic, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the stars are aligned equally—Baatin's squiggly esoteric weirdness, T3's rhyming with a chip on his shoulder, the celestial backdrops of Dilla's expansive, smooth-yet-rugged palette of soul samples. Everyone was locked in for these records, and the focus is on no single part, but the sum of Slum Village.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There's a beauty in how <i>local</i> these records are—not in terms of landmarks or civic pride (though that is palpable too), but in the sound of young artists trying to break away from a crowded pack of competition. T3 and Baatin experiment with bar formation, wordplay and vocal inflection—most notably on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fan-Tas-Tic, Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, which is more or less a collection of semi-polished demos chronicling their real-time progression from collaborators to actual group. O</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">n this debut, the rappers stutter as if trying figure out how to navigate over Dilla's low-end theories—the producer's tracks were incredibly articulate, full of intelligent bass grooves, cushioned and hidden drum patterns that spoke to a shyness, and an offbeat smattering of snaps, snares, ticks and claps that felt like nervous tension or socially awkward conversations full of pauses and repeated non-sequiturs. It's all there on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fan-Tas-Tic, Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">'s opening number, “Fantastic” which features a nearly-eerie but wholly-soothing track hosting laughable sex advice: “All you gotta do is grip your meat/ Laugh at her, massage her/ Take a bath with her/ Devour her.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Foreshadowing his final evolution with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Donuts</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, some of Dilla's tracks were lyrical enough to not require much rapping, and the group was smart enough to let some of his music breath, playing loose with their presence. For “Look of Love (Remix)” they laid back and mimicked Slick Rick; on “Hoc N Pucky” they free-styled over-the-top grunts and growls and sound effects; and on numbers like “Fantastic 2,” “Fantastic 3,” and “Fantastic 4,” they retreated to simply chanting hooks, treating alternate takes as half-song interludes. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the song titles (and history) get confusing, it's understandable. Slum Village wasn't necessarily focused on being easily accessible or readily formatted.  Songs, themes and concepts were constantly treated as serials, reduxed, remixed, and reprised; the average song length on the debut is about two-and-half minutes, with almost half of them clocking out before the 90-second mark. Amazingly, they all come off as complete ideas. There's never the impression that the crew ran out of ideas, or had too many to share—rather, it feels as if they said what they had to say and when they had no more to say, they stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> By the time </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fantastic, Vol. 2 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">was released in 2000, Dilla had worked closely with A Tribe Called Quest,  Busta Rhymes, Common, The Pharcyde and others—all of whom found new rhyme pockets in his work. T3 and Baatin obviously cribbed from these greats, but it wasn't just the rappers who felt emboldened by Jay's advancement.  One boon of his prodigious career is that—despite its brevity—Dilla's work had mini-phases and periods, like truncated versions of Picasso's Blue Period or Miles Davis' forays into fusion or funk. On </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> he's no longer condensed, adding a sense of comfort and ease to all his prior antics. Despite all of the (deserved) accolades given to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Donuts</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2—</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">with warm shimmers like “Get Dis Money,” “Fall In Love” and “Climax (Girl Shit);” throbbing excursions like “Eyes Up” and “Go Ladies”; and pulsing moments like “Conant Gardens” and “Raise It Up” —makes one of the strongest cases for Dilla's greatness.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The album featured Busta Rhymes, Kurupt, D'Angelo, Pete Rock, and—perhaps most notably—Q-Tip affirming the end of A Tribe Called Quest and anointing SV and flame keepers on “Hold Tight”: “Hold tight, this is the last time you hear me/ I'm out now, this is the last time to cheer me,"" he rapped. “I'ma leave it in the hands of the Slum now.” Q-Tip's declaration didn't help the album's fortunes much; </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> was shelved and left in purgatory for two years before being shipped off to another label. And by the end of that year, the Slum Village of Jay Dee, T3, and Baatin (who passed away in 2009) was no more.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fan-Tas-Tic: A Jay-Dee Production </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">also</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> comes through with a comprehensive history of Slum Village (the </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A Fan-Tas-Tic</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> story booklet), as well as full disc of instrumentals (which may or may not yield even more Dilla tributes), and a smattering of worthy remixes and further instrumentals from Pete Rock, Madlib and Dilla himself. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fan-Tas-Tic, Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fantastic, Vol. 2 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">themselves are slightly re-worked and extended, but mainly kept intact and made to sound crisper without losing their original basement charm.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The five included pieces of 7” vinyl seem gratuitous (their content is duplicated on the discs), but for the Dilla faithful and hardcore collectors, they're admirably fetishistic.  Some of the packaging seems thoughtless—the records, discs, and booklet are just in a box with too much space for them; they just sit and shift and will likely be damaged under less than the most careful handling. But the draw here should always be the music.  And Dilla comes through on both of these projects, but he's not the only one.  On the re-released version of <i>Vol. 2</i>'s “We Be Dem #1” (and “#2,” both a reworking of the Vol. 1's “Beej N Dem”) Baatin rap</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">s: “You say looking for them niggas, yeah, we be them/This shit remind me of some old EPM/ D shit,” before going on to shout out the Roots, Detroit's House Shoes, and his rhyme partner, but never Dilla. It may be sacrilege to many, but hearing Dilla without hearing rappers talk about Dilla is the best way to hear Dilla.  </span></p></div>"|21904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21904-the-fan-tas-tic-box-set/|8.5|kris ex

Every song happens on the way to something else, in the patches between starting out and ending up. Often it's unclear exactly where Gunn’s characters are headed, or why, but the flux in his words and music is vivid. To get caught up in these tunes is to eschew standing still.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite all the forward motion,</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Eyes on the Lines </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is also richly contemplative. As Gunn extolls the virtues of ambling, he gives himself lots of time to observe and ruminate. That reflectiveness is matched by the music, which is rarely static—there's always a shuffling beat or winding hook to keep the motor running—yet never rushed. Gunn’s band sounds confident without being complacent, and breezy in the best sense. The effects can be subtle as a whisper, but these songs continually move the air.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gunn continually refers to roads, paths, and changes in direction. In “The Drop,” he sings, “I think I missed my flight/Looks like I’ll spend the night,” and sounds pretty happy about it. By closer “Ark,” his blissful aimlessness takes on a Zen-like quality: “Here is where we’ll get nowhere/And everywhere is there now.” </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It might seem indulgent to pair such beatific sentiments with jammy guitar rock, but </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eyes on the Lines </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is actually quite focused. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Though Gunn’s songs develop gradually, the tensions mount and momentum builds. Often that comes from increasing jolts of energy, as in the stair-climbing hooks of </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18259-steve-gunn-ancient-jules/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ancient Jules</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,”</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18259-steve-gunn-ancient-jules/""> </a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">which celebrates losing control in a rush of layered guitars.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nine players are credited on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eyes on the Lines</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and you can feel their presence throughout, as each song weaves contributions into a tapestry. It’s been thrilling to see Gunn settle so well into collaboration. From his initial forays as a</span><a href=""https://threelobed.bandcamp.com/album/boerum-palace"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> solo artist,</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to his excellent duo </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15003-sand-city/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">albums</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> with drummer John Truscisnki, to 2014’s lush full-band album </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19821-steve-gunn-way-out-weather/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Way Out Weather</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, he’s continually stepped up without slipping. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eyes on the Lines </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">continues that ascent, as does Gunn’s sense of the world as a grand vista to traverse.

In terms of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Wailing Wailers</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, it would be tough to locate folks who don’t know the song “One Love” or the name of the fellow singing this song. Bob Marley is enough of a worldwide superstar that his face and his later lyrics are as familiar to American college students as they are to Ethiopian teenagers.</span></p>
<p><i> The Wailing Wailers</i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><i> </i>is not, by strict definition, an album—it wasn't recorded or sequenced as a whole. The Jamaican music industry has traditionally been shaped by singles, so this is effectively a singles bundle that was gathered up and released in late 1965. Not only does this highlight the first major recordings of Bob Marley (and it should be noted that most of the songs have Marley writing credits), but the happy, bouncy, optimistic sound of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Wailing Wailers </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is also the sound of post-independence Jamaica. It is the sound of a music that would soon reach out beyond the island and internationally through the remarkable voices of Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, and, most of all, Bob Marley.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Wailing Wailers </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">emerged from Clement “Coxsone” Dodd’s Studio One, one of the foundational, pioneering recording studios where Jamaican music is concerned. Operative from the 1950s through to the early 1980s, Studio One released ska, rocksteady, reggae, and dancehall over the years. The history of Studio One is key to the history of music in Jamaica and the rise of both reggae and Bob Marley.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Revisiting it now, you can also clearly hear the ways that popular music circulates and crosses borders. The influence of American R&amp;B and pop is evident—there’s a version of “What’s New Pussycat?” here—but also a specificity that places the record smack in the middle of the ska and rocksteady period, a precursor to the reggae that propelled Marley into the stratosphere of fame he found himself in the 1970s. Patwa, the Jamaican language, is a Creole that brings together various linguistic elements and structures stemming from West African languages, such as Twi and Yoruba, English, Spanish, Dutch, and Native American sources. A Creole language brings together all of these elements. Similarly, the musical genres of Jamaica are creolized forms. As case in point, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Wailing Wailers </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">brings together multiple influences, at times sounding like 1960s croony R&amp;B as on “I Need You,” skank-ready ska on “One Love” and “Simmer Down,” and then Patwa-inflected proto-reggae on the slightly slower “Rude Boy.”  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This past year novelist Marlon James became the first Jamaican to win the Man Booker prize for his novel </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A Brief History of Seven Killings</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. The book takes the attempted assassination of Bob Marley as its starting point and zooms out from there, taking in the scope of '70s Jamaica, extending forward to the 1990s. The panoramic scope of James’ book is a demonstration of Jamaica’s international reach and influence. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Wailing Wailers </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is another key piece of the artistic and creative juggernaut that is Jamaica, helping to demonstrate the narrative of reggae and of Bob Marley. With Jamaican creativity in the spotlight, it’s a perfect time to provide access to Studio One again.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Wailing Wailers </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is the first reissue from Yep Roc Music Group, who have access to the Studio One catalogue, thanks to an agreement with Coxsone’s daughter Carol Dodd, and they are starting as they plan to continue—with reissues of foundational albums (some quite rare) provided in the form of their original release. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Wailing Wailers </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is one that has been available since its original 1966 release, specifically by New England’s Heartbeat Records. Heartbeat lovingly reissued a good number of Studio One releases from 1983 through to the mid-'00s, but changes in the music industry meant that Heartbeat petered out. Yep Roc appears to be ably picking up the trail and providing high-quality LP, CD and digital access as well as involving Jamaican native Chris Wilson, the former A&amp;R manager for Heartbeat. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The care that has been put into this reissue is obvious. It’s meant to provide a historical touchpoint by utilizing all original album art and providing the same track listing as the first time around, and now a legendary album will be consistently available to whole new audiences. </span> </p></div>"|21960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21960-the-wailing-wailers/|8.0|Erin MacLeod

During its first five years, the Richmond quartet issued an auspicious debut EP, a split LP, and two very strong full-lengths, which colored the bleak grays of doom and the lurid greens of stoner metal with rainbow swirls of psychedelic rock. They jumped to Relapse Records, the giant of their field, for 2010’s menacing <i>Ritual Abuse</i> and, suddenly, went silent. One reason for the pause is <a href=""https://windhandva.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the success of Windhand</a>, Cough’s slightly-more-sophisticated and cryptic kin. Cough singer and bassist Parker Chandler handles the low-end rumble of that hard-touring and highly productive unit, limiting his time to return to his older band’s harder core. Indeed, a split between the two is all that Cough has released since 2010—at least until now, thanks to the band’s first album in six years.</p>
<p>Never mind the gap, actually: <i>Still They Pray </i>could have arrived anytime during, say, the last three decades and placed Cough alongside the ranks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22996-candlemass/"">Candlemass</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31266-cathedral/"">Cathedral</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22761-st-vitus/"">Saint Vitus</a>. It's not looking to dovetail with or participate in any modern scene or moment so much as gather and glorify the tropes of aged genres. They are scary and mean like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32290-eyehategod/"">Eyehategod</a>, hook-driven and magnetic like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32390-electric-wizard/"">Electric Wizard</a>. During these seventy minutes, Cough incorporates samples of Lovecraft text, spins into knotty solos, grinds riffs into dust, rages through a splendidly lysergic instrumental, and closes with benighted acoustic blues. When Chandler sings, he seems to inhale and exhale some cocktail of weed and hellfire smoke, as interested in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYvn9LLDWb0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sweet leaf</a> as he is<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=electric+wizard+black+masses&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> black masses. </a><i>Still They Pray</i> is a righteous echo of its classic forebears, turned way up and delivered with gospel-like belief.</p>
<p>For their first two albums, Cough handed production duties over to Sanford Parker, the hyper-productive Chicago musician and session overlord who’s worked with many of the most vital American metal acts of the last two decades. For their return, though, Cough went with <a href=""http://badfeelingmag.com/2015/03/30/interview-electric-wizard/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jus Oborn, the Electric Wizard leader and a bona fide titan in the form.</a> He helmed these sessions alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31193-windhand/"">Windhand</a> guitarist Garrett Morris.</p>
<p>The move to Osborn opens up the band’s sound, revealing layers and depths that Parker often pushed toward the middle. During “Possession,” for instance, Oborn meticulously layers the dual guitars of David Cisco and Brandon Marcey, a pair that’s perfected its balance of mantra-like repetition and howling solos. And he brilliantly divides the nine-and-a-half-minutes “Let It Bleed” into two distinct phases, so that the first half suggests some salvaged grunge obscurity, with mumbled vocals about nihilism and low-key, highly muffled guitars. But after an instrumental interlude, Cough charges back twice as loud, the guitars and Chandler now screaming in delirious, demented tandem. It ties together two ends of Cough’s inspirations and ideas.</p>
<p>For the eight minutes of mid-album highlight “Masters of Torture,” Cough pivots between low-tempo, high-distortion terror, rippling blues solos, and mutated-and-drugged thrash. It’s a clear composite of antecedents, a distillation of heroes that’s obvious but no less compelling for being so blatant. Cough slows down one last time in the final minute, and Chandler—voice warped by a web of effects, as if singing from inside a tomb—begins to chant a koan: “Live to hate/Hate to live,” he yells, repeating it until the riff dissolves into feedback. This grim perspective on reality represents a time-honored, timeless thesis for bands like Cough, whose central obsession with demons, death, and the romance of the underworld is, ironically, bound to outlive them.</p></div>"|21890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21890-still-they-pray/|7.6|Grayson Haver Currin

He's more on the sidelines than in the fields, but he's not an outsider looking in, either. An accessory by necessity, he's smart enough to not snitch and careful enough to make his death threats subliminal, yet still aware enough to speak as the conscience from within the belly of the beast, because he personally knows of the tolls paid on the backroads to riches. “You see the world in my daughter's eyes/If you had seen what she had seen, you'd be traumatized,” he raps.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's tempting to simplify when talking about artists, to shave off their multitudes, flatten, and categorize them. Because he is</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> part of Chicago's Savemoney crew—the loose collective of artists that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32308-vic-mensa/"">Vic Mensa</a>, and others—Joey comes with a certain set of preconceptions, namely that he be a technically proficient stylist with a progressive artistic bent. He fits that bill, sometimes, but he's a little deeper and more human than that.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Boastful and thoughtful, socially aware and defiantly filthy, longing for the music industry's spoils while simultaneously disregarding them—</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">his various sides come together on <i>iiiDrops</i>, which is more well-rounded and definitive than his woozy <i>The Purple Tape </i>or his word-centric experimentalism as part of Leather Corduroys.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Where Chance spent<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21909-coloring-book/"">Coloring Book</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> showcasing the audacity of his hope for a better tomorrow, Joey is a panoramic and holistic realist when he looks around at the forces and people that support the cycle of violence in his hometown. On “Cornerstore” he rides a horn-powered groove from Thelonious Martin and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32978-donnie-trumpet/"">Donnie Trumpet</a>, dropping off pinpoint observations along the way: He recalls speaking to his brother who may never come home from behind bars, confesses of marijuana dreams of drug kingpin success, notes that “White kids deal with problems that we never knew to bother/Arguing with they dads, we pray we ever knew our fathers,” and watches gentrification from ground zero: “Now up in the corners where killers used to inhabit/They built a row of new condos where they tore down project buildings.” He's joined by Saba (another Savemoney satellite), who matches him observation for observation: “My best friend from when I was 11, posted with the weapon/Actin' like he do not see me step into they section/We used to hoop daily and treat it like a profession/And now I'm walking by him like I'm some type of pedestrian.”</span></p>
<p>Joey’s songs make no distinction between the personal and political, and see systemic failures through the lenses of individuals without ever quite pointing fingers or succumbing to victimization. “We grow up being neglected by our elected officials,” he raps on “Money &amp; Bitches.” “My nigga, cry me a river, I’ll buy you a tissue/ I don’t wanna hear your complainin’, you pressin’ my issue/All I know is money and bitches.” There’s also little difference between good thoughts and worthy wordplay—every rhyme and idea flows into a next; almost every moment is quotable and represents a greater whole. It’s an astounding feat for someone who tried to lean and swag his way through his first solo project.</p>
<p>In a year that's been dominated by headline releases from marquee artists, <i>iiiDrops</i> has the making of a sleeper hit. The POV is measured and insightful, the rhyming is assured by both technical and narrative metrics, and the music is quietly confident and sharply novel—Knox Fortune and GARREN's funky broken soul on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18246-joey-purp-photobooth/"">Photobooth</a>,” OddCouple's triumphant swing on “Morning Sex,” the stripped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"">Neptunes</a>-ish drumplay of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18292-joey-purp-girls-ft-chance-the-rapper/"">Girls@</a>” and “Say You Do,” updated blaxploitation psychedelia on “Godbody,” a semi-paranoid summer evening pulse to “When I'm Gone.” Some of the numbers sound like they belong of a producer’s showcase, more than a rapper’s coming out party, but Joey rides every beat with an easy intensity that makes his worldview the unifying factor here. He never allows the tracks to become the sole point of focus, and it takes Chance the Rapper—going on about dead batteries as a pick-up line to girls “readin' Ta-Nehisi Coates”—to upstage the star of this show.</p>
<p>Purp is adept at juggling and offering competing meanings, often from within the same song: “When I'm Gone” shuffles between a tale of relationship drama and fights with his boss, while the closer “Escape” is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>-like stream of boasting and history and chest-thumping prediction that plays like Purp's “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t195yz9xCc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">5 A.M. in Chicago</a>.” But he never comes off jumbled or all-over-the-place; he not only sees both sides of murder, but also the bigger picture. On “Morning Sex,” he raps, “Look in the mirror, all I see is the money / I close my eyes, all I see is the money.” He's not immune to capitalism's siren, but he's aware of the opportunity costs. Unfortunately, his gaze does not extend to seeing women in whole; there's nary a girl mentioned who isn't a ho, a nag, or one or the other in the making. That’s a disappointing state of affairs, but there is hope: If you look into his daughter’s eyes, you can see the world. And when he looks in the mirror, he sees his mother’s eyes. He's traumatized, but he’s still looking.</p></div>"|21913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21913-iiidrops/|8.2|kris ex

While they never disappeared worldwide—girl groups and their alumnae dominate J- and K-pop, for instance—the only two Western girl groups with consistent pop clout are the UK’s Little Mix and the States’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32747-fifth-harmony/"">Fifth Harmony</a>, both products of their respective countries’ “X Factors.”</p>
<p>There are some downsides to this. Most groups that get far on “The X Factor” are assembled from failed solo auditions, and while plenty of girl groups are unglamorously cobbled together via some backstage machination or other, it’s one thing to know that and another to watch five solo hopefuls get rejected on live-TV and then jettisoned into a band with three consecutive names slapped onto it, one of which was a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh7Izn8dt78"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bruno Mars family act</a> and one of which was a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy3SURjqJKM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Musiq Soulchild song</a>. And while the “X Factor” process selects for vocal talent and marketable personality, it rarely selects for the two <i>together</i>; what you end up with are a lot of singers with indistinguishably winning voices and #winning presence. Fifth Harmony’s early singles sounded less like the work of a coherent group than a diva scrimmage, each singer trying to outperform the rest—inevitably, because that’s literally what they came on the show hoping to do.</p>
<p>It’s been several years and hits since then, though, and Fifth Harmony’s had some time to grow into themselves. The first track on <i>7/27—</i>the day the group originally formed—is as good a State of the Cowell-Administered Union as any. It begins like a retread of past hit “Worth It,” down to the deliberately squawky sax beat, but soon becomes a pep talk for fans complete with cheerleader whoops, a call to (immaculately toned) arms, and a showcase for each vocalist, now with discernibly individual personae: Ally on lead and Dinah on backup, Normani with the near-rap, Lauren’s cool alto balancing Camila’s Ring Pop of a voice. (Rumors of the latter being groomed for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngORmvyvAaI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a solo career</a>, at least as of this album, are exaggerated; <i>7/27 </i>is as vocally egalitarian as any girl-group album of the past decade or so, and better for it.) It’s easily the best potential single the group’s ever released.</p>
<p>It also sounds exactly like 2003—specifically, like a cut off Christina Aguilera’s <i>Back to Basics </i>or Mya’s<i> Moodring</i>. An even eerier flashback comes with “Not That Kinda Girl,” which rehashes the look-don’t-touch theme that was everywhere in pop in ‘03 and adds <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"">Missy Elliott</a>, who as usual lately is operating at maybe 50% of peak but is welcome nevertheless because 50% of peak Missy is still pretty damn good. The echoes of early-'00s R&amp;B radio  seem to say more about the length of the pop nostalgia cycle than anything about Fifth Harmony in particular, which points to a larger issue: For all the group’s done to establish each singer vocally, they’ve yet to pin down a <i>sonic</i> identity, nor a lyrical identity beyond vague empowerment, and <i>7/27 </i>dutifully triangulates every trend and radio format of the past couple years. There’s stuttery, pitch-shifted EDM with “The Life.” There’s the fake <a href=""http://rnbass.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">r&amp;bass</a> track “Work From Home,” wherein Dr. Luke protégé Ammo imitates rap producers imitating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a>. There’s even diluted reggae and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32924-fetty-wap/"">Fetty Wap</a> collaboration, both on “All in My Head (Flex),” which samples Mad Cobra’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAe3sIxcXw0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flex</a>.” About half the tracks have tropical-house synths stuck in like cocktail umbrellas.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the trendier the track, the worse Fifth Harmony showcase it proves. Several of the songs also suffer from brutally protracted lyrical metaphors that function as near-parodies of pop song form. It’s not entirely Fifth Harmony’s fault, for instance, that r&amp;bass ceased to be a thing well before “Work from Home,” or that everyone missed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32841-jordin-sparks/"">Jordin Sparks</a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL7N94_0OIo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">near-identical 2015 single</a> called “Work From Home,” or even that everyone (somehow) missed a certain megastar’s No. 1 single about work-work-work-work-work-work. It’s definitely their fault that <i>this</i> single involves a lot of metaphorically sexing up the freelance life, which is perhaps the least sexy labor arrangement in world history. (More accurate first verse: “worried about basically everything, wearing ripped pajamas”). Or that only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a>—whose verse is one big leadup to a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7337-t-pain/"">T-Pain</a>-esque “put in overtime on your <i>booooddddyyyyyyyy!”—</i>takes the material as seriously as he should, which is to say not at all. </p>
<p>Like most girl groups, Fifth Harmony trades in the kind of pop-cultural press-quote feminism where the group can say they are out squash gender roles and “<a href=""http://www.spin.com/2016/02/fifth-harmony-work-from-home-727-5h-camila-cabello-interview-video-watch/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gender-institutionalized thinking</a>” while recording a fantasy of a stay-at-home sexter reassuring the household breadwinner that he’s the boss at home. And like girl groups historically, they grapple with how to reconcile that independence with love. The original girl groups were as liable to record <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE_jOD2Fxvs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">love songs</a> as wistful, even macabre<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8UKf65NOzM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> cautionary tales.</a> Modern groups Little Mix and Spice sing love songs, but they couldn’t be more obvious that their heart belongs to their besties. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1067-destinys-child/"">Destiny’s Child</a>, with few exceptions, repudiated love entirely: “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f_YTbQzlik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">if you ain’t in love, I congratulate you</a>.”</p>
<p><i>7/27</i>, though, approaches the subject with full abandon. “I Lied” thoroughly rescues its conceit from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv5vMJKBAbo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Bolton hell</a> and turns it into a sighing, feverish surge reminiscent of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XY3AvVgDns"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Countdown</a>.” Bonus track “Dope” is even more crushed-out, with a track that sounds like jittering through the whole runtime of a slow jam and lines delivered like so many words to stumble over en route to the big confession: “I don’t know what else to say, but you’re pretty fucking dope.” It strikes that rarest of balances for crush songs—confident but skittish, sure of one’s exact feelings but clueless about what to do next, independent but nevertheless absolutely swooningly done for—and also feels like a first. Mediocre girl-group material is a cartoon simulation of women’s lives. Good girl-group material reflects them. Great girl-group material recasts them in 3D with all the color cranked up. Finally, albeit in flashes, there are hints that Fifth Harmony may reach that peak. </p></div>"|21932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21932-727/|6.2|Katherine St. Asaph

Usually it’s when a DJ constructs a set that steers you towards euphoria so effectively that it feels like they’re inside your brain at a panel of controls, à la Voltron—a state of ecstatic dissociation so magical that it's the third most popular subject for pop songs after love and smoking weed. But rare and particularly talented DJs can pull off an even more magical feat, dragging you out of your head and into their minds, letting you hear the world through their ears for a moment.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I used to think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/""><span class=""s2"">Dâm-Funk</span></a> was the more typical kind of DJ, mostly because I’ve only seen him at festivals and big events, and never at Funkmosphere, the residency he’s held at an L.A. bar for the past 10 years. In that more intimate environment, he can stretch out and offer a fully immersive sound experience. And after hearing his contribution to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=DJ-Kicks""><span class=""s2"">DJ-Kicks</span></a> franchise, which is designed to replicate the Funkmosphere vibe, it’s clear that he’s actually the second kind of DJ, and maybe one of the best at that specific kind of mind meld.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Heard through Dâm-Funk’s ears, the world is, as you might expect, a very funky place. It’s also very dreamy. Dâm may be best known for reigniting L.A.’s passion for hard-edged, car-shaking synth funk, but at 44, he seems more interested in creating a shared hypnagogic utopian mindspace than simply rocking a party.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The mix’s tempo tops out at a fairly restrained 126 BPM, and most of the tracks chill a few notches below. The mood is overwhelmingly easy-going, from contemporary synth auteur Moon B’s study in warm, reverb-drenched minimalism that opens the mix, to the closing shimmer of Philly-inspired soul group Crystal Winds’ 1982 track “Funk Ain’t Easy.” Some of the selections, like the airbrushed erotic fantasia “Love Jam” by the cultishly strange duo <a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2009/09/randell-schippers.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">Randell &amp; Schippers</span></a> (who have a screencap of a complimentary MySpace comment from Dâm on <a href=""http://www.dennyrandell.com/randell-schippers/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">the homepage of their website</span></a>, beneath a backstage photo at a Blue Man Group show), border on New Age. Others, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32664-gaussian-curve/"">Gaussian Curve</a>’s synth pad daydream “Broken Clouds,” cross fully over.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Taken as a whole, the mix paints a soothing watercolor portrait of a funk-based American counterpart to Balearic house—a style that Ibiza ravers were starting to greet the dawn with around the same time as the bulk of Dâm’s DJ-Kicks picks were being recorded–that never actually existed. Piecing together obscure old cuts from regional labels that probably wouldn’t ever have crossed paths back in the day (like Verticle Lines’ proto-vaporwave 1982 breeze-funk rarity “Theme From Beach Boy” and Gemini’s airy 1997 take on Chicago house, “Log In”) Dâm’s crafted an entire genre in retrospect.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s a sound with a promising future, if this mix is any indication. Dâm’s picks lean heavily on vintage grooves that are extremely rare even by crate-digger standards, but some of the strongest material is new. There’s Moon B’s “Oof,” and Kansas City funk auteur Reggie B’s purplishly psychedelic “Poison Candy,” and Dutch producer Henning’s “Arrival / Departure,” which drops a throbbing G-funk beat into a crystalline garden of blissful synth flutes.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Despite Dâm’s preference for playing tracks pretty much all the way through—which suggests an infectious, wide-eyed passion for the music that fits into his mind-control powers—the mix is properly appreciated as a whole. You can let it wash away whatever cares you have in warm, funky waves. There are a few songs that deserve to be listened to on their own, though, and one of the best comes from a collaboration between Dâm and fellow L.A. dreamchaser <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"">Nite Jewel</a>. “Can U Read Me?” takes the peak-Janet weightless perfection of “All for You” and turns its touch even lighter, transforming it into something that captures the joy of seeing the sun rise in the corner of your eye and knowing the party isn’t even close to being over. Funk may not be easy, but with Dâm at the controls it can sure feel that way.</span></p></div>"|21942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21942-dj-kicks/|7.7|Miles Raymer

A great example of this is </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collapse</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the latest album by Japanese artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31927-seiho/"">Seiho</a>, a genre-fluid record which follows in the footsteps of its forebears in the hopes of creating something new and distinct out of fresh ideas, beat culture and curated found sounds.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collapse</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a strange and beautiful record that refuses categorization, traipsing through the fields of house, free jazz and musique concrète on the way to something inscrutably Other. Despite being ostensibly an “electronic” record, Seiho proudly boasts that “very few samples were used in the making of the LP,” instead utilizing live instrumentation and sounds captured in personal recordings of animals, machines and nature, which he sculpted into many of the beats, rhythms and chirps put on display. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The idea of turning found sounds into electronic music is nothing new, of course.<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/""> Matthew Herbert</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/980-matmos/"">Matmos</a> have been releasing records with beats made from hand-crafted sound recordings for years, with two of the most famous examples coming in 2001 with the former’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17491-bodily-functions/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bodily Functions</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and the latter’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5151-a-chance-to-cut-is-a-chance-to-cure/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Both of those records derived their power in part from their slavish devotion to specific themes (sounds from bodies and medical procedures, respectively). </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One spin of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collapse</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, however, and you can tell that Seiho is going for something else, something freer and less constricted by subject matter; rather than focusing on a world bodies or industrial machines, Seiho wants you to hear the wandering world that passes in front of him. </span>And wander it does—over the course of only thirty-three minutes, <i>Collapse</i> darts and dashes from sound to idea to sound like the speed-shifting brain of a manic teenager. Not one track of the ten lingers on a single musical idea for long. Even the track (possibly ironically) titled “Deep House” doesn't have a single deep house or even house-inspired idea coursing through it.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For this reason, it’s easier to see </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collapse</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as a single work with repeating index points rather than a collection of “songs.” There’s jazz-concrète (“The Vase”), actual deep house (“Exhibition,” “Plastic”), and whimsical IDM (“<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18013-seiho-peach-and-pomegranate/"">Peach and Pomegranate</a>,” “DO NOT LEAVE WET”); many songs, such as “Edible Chrysanthemum,” touch multiple indexes. In many ways, this record is a kindred spirit to last month’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21911-fool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brainfeeder release </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fool</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> by Dutch artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33594-jameszoo/"">Jameszoo</a>. But while that record felt messy and basement-made, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collapse</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is neat and pristine, as if every careening moment has been carefully crafted and controlled so that no matter how wild it gets, it will never fall apart.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s no question that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collapse</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a fascinating, inspired record. But the obvious challenge in making music this inherently fidgety is that it can be tough for a listener to stay engaged for long stretches of time, let alone the duration. As a result, some of the tracks get boring (“Deep House,” “Rubber”) and others start or end interestingly but can’t sustain the momentum throughout. </span></p>
<p>“Edible Chrysanthemum” and “DO NOT LEAVE WET” manage to hold on to their ideas just long enough to sink in deeper than the rest.  The first begins with pleasant mechanical hums and aviary trills, then picks up a mock-gamelan beat (maybe samples of sticks on glass) before giving way to a mournful near-jazz of horn, piano and percussive clacks. Album closer “DO NOT LEAVE WET” is easily the warmest and poppiest track: Beautiful, rich and full, and featuring a wider range of instrumentation of '80s funk and R&amp;B, it invites jamming in summer mornings en route to the beach, or maybe afternoon mojitos. The song plays almost like your reward for staying put, and underlines that with a bit more focus and clarity, Seiho might evolve into an important voice in the new guard of experimental electronicists. </p></div>"|21937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21937-collapse/|7.4|Benjamin Scheim

And with that rise, he’s become something of a dance music Rorschach test: either he’s <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/arts/music/flume-rises-in-the-edm-world.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">posited as mainstream electropop’s next great hope</a>, or he deepens the frowns of those fatigued by rave culture ubiquity and personifies all that is frivolous about it. (<i>The Guardian </i>recently <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/29/flume-skin-review-raekwon-alunageorge-little-dragon-vince-staples-harley-edward-streten-never-be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">brushed him aside</a> with, “Oh, great! Just what the world has been waiting for,” a pessimism that leans toward <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U1-OmAICpU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Woody Allen school of astronomy</a>.) It’s no wonder, on his second album, Flume says he aimed to write a track that sounds “<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BFwXWgYTYh7/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like the fabric of the universe tearing </a>”—all that weight was cramping his shoulders.</p>
<p><i>Skin</i>, the record in question, aims for that level of grandiosity throughout. It’s a stadium-sized upsell of Flume’s prior atmospheric formula—skittish beats that cleave easily to gruff rappers and R&amp;B sopranos alike, rattling future-bass warp, undulating synths—that swells with energy but spills over edges. Here, Flume recruits an array of famous guests (Beck, Little Dragon, Vince Staples, Raekwon, AlunaGeorge), padding their radio-friendly cuts with the persistent crescendos of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17484-flume-flume/"">self-titled debut</a>, then ballasting them with loose instrumental interludes. The sum suggests that he’s an earnest collaborator, flashier but still casting around for a distinct identity.</p>
<p>Flume has a fondness for female voices singing in their upper register. On his first album, that role was played by Jezzabell Doran on the album’s best cut (“Sleepless”). Here, it’s handled twofold by Aluna Francis of AlunaGeorge (the groggy, glitchy “Innocence”) and also Kučka, a young Aussie singer who distinctly echoes Francis in slinky R&amp;B phrasing and tinny topnotes. The halting, futurist beat of Kučka’s solo track (“Numb &amp; Getting Colder”) nods to Flying Lotus and Four Tet; that core is closely repeated on her second turn, “Smoke &amp; Retribution,” which jolts awake in agile verses by rapper Vince Staples. The lead single, “Never Be Like You,” is already a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzeLJOSSRDU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure-remixed pop hit</a> (and a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KPnyf8vwXI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">winking psychotropic video</a>); it saunters on Flume’s languid trap drops and a plummy R&amp;B hook from the Canadian singer Kai, a former Jack Ü collaborator who trills a mundane mea culpa with a gleam of defiance. (“I’m only human can’t you see/I made, I made a mistake/Please just look me in my face/Tell me everything’s OK”). There’s a mathematical quality to how he deploys singers in these productions, where the heavier his low-end distortion throbs, the more featherweight smoke curls follow. </p>
<p>Snuck in at the close, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/65710-listen-to-flume-and-becks-new-song-tiny-cities/"">Tiny Cities</a>,” featuring Beck, is comparatively minimalist, a welcome smattering of downtempo new wave synths. Here, the production is as nimble as the vocalist; Beck opens in staccato leaps, chipper despite the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/617-sea-change/"">Sea Change</a></i>-like refrain of despondency (“it was never perfect, never meant to last”), and Flume loops him in a slow, roiling momentum until the sentiment blooms into a battle-scarred catharsis worthy of a John Hughes soundtrack. There’s one betrayal of Flume’s busy hand in the song, in a dubstep-lite drop halfway, but it’s energizing. The delicate ebb that follows it—complete with falsetto from Beck, naturally—is the most vulnerable moment of the album. <i>Skin</i>’s other cameos don’t approach that humanity: Little Dragon’s “Take a Chance” buckles under an erratic beat that feels determined to remix itself twice over, and Tove Lo’s lilt sounds harried on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/64943-flume-and-tove-lo-team-for-new-song-say-it-listen/"">Say It</a>,” though her chorus does generously provide your next Tinder icebreaker (“let me fuck you right back”).</p>
<p>Against this, the instrumentals can be hesitant, as if waiting patiently for a vocalist to drop by—“Pika” stretches out a fragment of a SBTRKT-like soul murmur, and “Free” pushes the repetitive yet determined synth runs of a keytar gained sentience. But there is one glimpse of intriguing extroversion in Flume’s standalones: “Wall Fuck,” the musician’s aforementioned attempt to rip the universe a new one, which delivers a hell of a rubbery, electrohouse-inflected bass and snarls a sliver of ghostly female coos into a strange, invigorating banger. It’s short and snappy, gone too fast in an album that could’ve been streamlined to let moments like it shine. But maybe it’s the sound of floodgates opening.</p></div>"|21921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21921-skin/|6.4|Stacey Anderson

Having played guitar alongside some of Nashville’s most distinctive songwriters (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2417-lambchop/"">Lambchop</a>’s Kurt Wagner and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/"">Silver Jews</a>’ David Berman), he has clearly learned a good deal from them about establishing his voice, structuring narratives, and building tension. But Tyler—whose solo albums are purely instrumental—works in a field all his own, composing increasingly intricate and immersive narratives with just his playing. Tyler referred to his 2013 Merge Records debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17780-william-tyler-impossible-truth/"">Impossible Truth</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as being a “’70s singer-songwriter record without vocals,” and he develops that vision even more fully on its follow-up, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Modern Country</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Backed by an all-star band that notably includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>’s Glenn Kotche and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"">Megafaun</a>’s Phil Cook, Tyler is able to summon a wide range of moods, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">from plaintive pastoral folk to a particular kind of <i>k</i><i>osmische</i> American music that fuses Brad Cook’s spacey synths and Luke Schneider’s gorgeous pedal steel like a slow, steady breeze on a hot summer day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even with all the talent in the room, Tyler’s guitar remains front and center. In “Kingdom of Jones,” his close-mic’d fingerpicking is breathtaking. The clear, constant sound of his strings rattling and his hand sliding across the neck highlight just how intimately produced and carefully performed these songs are. While quieter moments like these feel like a natural progression from Tyler’s early solo guitar work, other songs demonstrate how complex his signature style has become. Of course, there are enough sprightly, rubbery guitar licks to remind you that this is a guy whose </span><a href=""http://www.williamtyler.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">official website</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> also functions as a carefully curated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"">Grateful Dead</a> video blog. Still, Tyler puts an emphasis on both words in the album title. The compressed, layered solos in the first half of “The Great Unwind” recall prime-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"">Mark McGuire</a>, while its triumphant, chugging second half actually brings to mind prime-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22354-mark-knopfler/"">Mark Knopfler</a>. First single “Gone Clear,” meanwhile, is Tyler’s most dazzling composition yet: a six-minute stunner that plays like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O’Rourke</a>’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13468-the-visitor/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Visitor </span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">reimagined to soundtrack a ballet. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tyler’s thematic inspirations are equally far-reaching. “Kingdom of Jones” is dedicated to the Mississippi county whose anti-slavery stance during the Civil War put them at odds with the rest of the Confederacy. The lilting, starry-eyed “Albion Moonlight” is named for the title character of Kenneth Patchen’s American classic </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Journals of Albion Moonlight</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (a character who coincidently posits that “Man has been corrupted by his symbols” and that “Language has killed his animal”—arguments put into practice by the band's quiet, evocative performances). Like his holographic figure on the album cover, Tyler lets himself become a part of his surroundings throughout <i>Modern Country</i>, encouraging his listeners to explore for themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“The cultural geography of this vanishing America is what I sense as a slow fade,” spoke Tyler’s disembodied voice in a trailer announcing the album’s release: the kind of grandiose mission statement that might seem over-the-top were it not coming from an artist whose music is so radiantly full of ideas. He continued, “</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Modern Country </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is a love letter to what we are losing in America– to what we’ve already lost.” The beauty of the album lies in the fact that Tyler is able to pay homage to these foundations not with bitterness or cynicism but with awe, appreciation, and even hope. </span></p></div>"|21916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21916-modern-country/|8.0|Sam Sodomsky

MC Ninja teases the record in an interlude where he mimics geek king Napoleon Dynamite, a cultural reference so dated and worn-out that 12 years have passed and it still feels too soon to revive it. It's a neat stand-in for the South African rap trio and troll merchants Die Antwoord themselves: They may have started this act with the intention of discomfiting us  and making us think, but in 2016, they are merely wearisome.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even though it’s hard to erase the shock rap-rave South African group’s rat-infested, toilet-sitting, loogie-hocking videos from your memory (we’ve tried), it has been two years since they released their last album, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Donker Mag</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, so here’s a refresher: Ninja and Yolandi Vi$$er embrace “zef,” a philosophy that encourages intentional vulgarity. In doing so, they’ve created a body of work that at times can be engaging. Even now, it’s hard not to be riveted by 2010’s “Zef Side”—there’s that slow-mo of Ninja’s knock-kneed thrusts that send his flaccid penis flopping around in his </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dark Side of the Moon</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> shorts; there’s Yolandi’s severe mullet, her awkward dancing and alien-like visage. In the ensuing years, however, we’ve become inured to Twitter trolls and ALL CAP$ personalities. More often than not these days, Die Antwoord comes off as tired and trying way too hard. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a 2012 interview about their sophomore album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16270-tenion/"">Ten$ion</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Die Antwoord said their issues with Interscope stemmed from the label urging them to “be more generic.”  This is an ironic claim, for it's precisely what plagues </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Suck on This, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">their first mixtape since being liberated from their contract. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the tape includes new material along with remixes of old songs, the whole thing sounds like a retread. Nothing here is as bad as Ninja’s nasally chorus on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ten$ion</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s opening track “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Never Le Nkemise 1” or the unlistenable Uncle Jimmy skit, but maybe “boring” is a worse criticism than “bad.” </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">S</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ure, there are moments here that you can imagine playing well to festival crowds: If you close your eyes during the drops on “Gucci Coochie,” you can practically see the rows of shirtless bros and underbutt-showing girls in the Sahara tent at Coachella losing their minds. The best production is on the slinky, simmering “Bum Bum,” but Ninja’s line, “Bed wet, legs spread, big mess everywhere” is such a profoundly gross visual that you will be lunging for the skip button.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it’s all said and done, the remixes are the most interesting tracks on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Suck on This</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and God (fka DJ Hi-Tek) especially squeezes some life out of Die Antwoord’s most popular songs. He pumps “I Fink You Freaky” full of steroids, bumping up Letterman’s favorite song to a vein-popping, eyes-bulging, steam-spouting cartoon. The last 45 seconds reach such berserk Road Runner-levels, you wonder if he’s making fun of electro trap. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If so, he’s beating Ninja and Yolandi at their own game. At this point, it all—even the letter that accompanied </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Suck on This </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">claiming they didn’t know what a mixtape was—feels too contrived to be enjoyable. Maybe </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We Have Candy</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> will surprise us and swerve far left, but if not, Die Antwoord’s getting muted. </span></p></div>"|21976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21976-suck-on-this/|5.0|Rebecca Haithcoat

It's understandable: Most songwriting places a premium on some sort of basic honesty, and asking someone “are you joking?” is usually a way to determine if they are shitting you. Honest, earnest attempts to be funny, meanwhile, usually end up with the opposite result. So this is what </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Awkward Pop Songs </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">knowingly puts itself up against—its cover art and album title immediately establish its prank-punk bonafides and “JANK” itself is probably even sillier than the <i></i><i></i>""Futurama"" reference frontperson Matt Diamond used for previous band <a href=""https://panuccispizza.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Panucci’s Pizza</a>. But in the few months since its initial release and its physical reissue, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Awkward Pop Songs </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">has lived out a lyric from another <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"">trio</a> whose superficial goofiness was a Trojan horse for one of the most inventive, original and flat-out </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fun </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14662-sit-down-man/"">records</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in its realm: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVwnZMAgpT8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Saw the cover of the tape, figured it’s pretty wack/later on eventually admitted that it’s pretty crack.”</a></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As was the case with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"">Das Racist</a>, local heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"">Ween</a>, and even the Golden State Warriors, JANK’s irreverence feels like an unlocked superpower rather than a defense mechanism or compensatory measure—that they’re having this much fun with their technically astonishing chops makes their subversion of <i>realness</i> seem all the more amazing. Even more improbable is the number of styles in which they can operate: though the title </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Awkward Pop Songs </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is the least-clever aspect of the LP, it’s an accurate descriptor for an overview of nearly every offshoot of “revival” emo that has coalesced into the new shape of alternative rock.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s plenty of the arpeggiated, hammer-and-pull guitar of the dubious, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/76-american-football/"">American Football</a>-fathered “twinkle” subgenre, as well as the two-handed tapping that marks its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4meXe1UxiY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mathier</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1dfVnlmx_A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">offshoots</a>.

Diamond’s voice can elicit the instantaneous thrills of raw-throated, Midwestern emo and caffeinated pop-punk without the requisite adenoidal whine. In fact, the songs that most immediately sound like they're crushing hard on someone</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">turn into surrealistic stoner talk: “Caitlyn” proposes a playdate of “Katamari Damacy” and late-night TV with an imaginary dog. “Wut I Liek Abt U” cops the irrepressible, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21125-nothing-feels-good/"">house party</a> giddiness of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21125-nothing-feels-good/"">Nothing Feels Good</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and its whimsical, quotable non-sequiturs—“And you could use a new toothbrush!;” “Tell me your favorite kind of dinosaur?”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At its peaks, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Awkward Pop Songs</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> draws a fat highlighter on the connection between emo’s fourth wave and the unconventional, genre-spanning pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1093-the-dismemberment-plan/"">the Dismemberment Plan</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4436-the-unicorns/"">the Unicorns</a>, bands whose manic, effusive, anti-cool styles soon were subsumed by more earnest, bombastic forms of indie rock. This aspect of JANK can make </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Awkward Pop Songs </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sound damn-near necessary in 2016—if peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31970-foxing/"">Foxing</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31608-the-world-is-a-beautiful-place-i-am-no-longer-afra/"">The World is a Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid to Die</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31939-the-hotelier/"">the Hotelier</a> are stewards of the communally composed, broadly ambitious sound of mid-decade indie rock, they also have its tendency towards somber intensity.</span></p>

In the days of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"">Red House Painters</a>, Kozelek recorded devastating interpretations of songs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2307-kiss/"">Kiss</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"">Paul McCartney</a>, and even Francis Scott Key to prove just how widely applicable<b> </b>his brand of melancholy was.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> His selection of covers—often picked straight from the classic-rock songbook—drew a clear line from his sepia-toned shoegaze to golden-era '70s radio, culminating in his curation of <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Various-Take-Me-Home-A-Tribute-To-John-Denver/release/709241"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a John Denver tribute album</a> at the turn of the millennium and his ensuing move toward more straight-ahead singer-songwriter material under the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"">Sun Kil Moon</a> moniker. In the first decade of the '00s, as Kozelek’s music found him less focussed on emotional extremes and more on the gray areas in between, he recorded subtle, gorgeous versions of songs by contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a>, and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/698-casiotone-for-the-painfully-alone/""> Casiotone for the Painfully Alone</a>. Up until his recent turn toward diaristic, autobiographical songwriting, these covers were some of his most revealing work: songs that felt as much a part of his legacy as any he had written.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In that sense, Kozelek’s latest collection of covers, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mark Kozelek Sings Favorites</span></i> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is his most classically Kozelekian release since 2010’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14430-admiral-fell-promises/"">Admiral Fell Promises</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the solo guitar mood piece that served as the finale for one season of his career, before 2012’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16674-among-the-leaves/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among the Leaves</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ushered in a prolific era of controversies and </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/sadreminders/status/691687334484414464"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">absurdly big lyric sheets</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Like </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Admiral Fell Promises</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mark Kozelek Sings Favorites </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">features some material that will be familiar to longtime followers. Tracks like Bob Seger’s “Mainstreet” and the traditional folk song “Get Along Home Cindy” have appeared in his live sets for years. Meanwhile, a superior rendition of “Send in the Clowns” first showed up on his 2008 odds-and-ends collection </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12492-the-finally-lp/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Finally</span></i> <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">LP</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and “Float On” marks the twelfth <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a> cover Kozelek has put to tape. As such, the title of this collection feels as much a means of drawing a tenuous thematic link between the material as it is a way of admitting, “These are just some songs that Mark Kozelek already knew the words to.” As with the previous release in this series (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19932-mark-kozelek-sings-christmas-carols/"">Sings Christmas Carols</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">), you will probably know whether or not you want to hear it based on the title alone.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Still, it’s 2016 and it wouldn’t be a new Kozelek release without a few surprises. The most obvious change here is the fact that the sole accompaniment on the album is piano, an instrument used sparingly but effectively throughout his work. And while these performances are a far cry from, say, “Shadows”—the stirring piano ballad highlight from 1995’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20517-box-set/"">Ocean Beach</a>—</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Favorites </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">has a few fine moments. “Float On,” a song whose tragic afterlife has found it </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z06GwcesN1A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kidz Bopped</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmp6zIr5y4U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">even worse</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, finally gets a rendition it deserves. Stripped of its iconic guitar hook, Kozelek’s rendition places the focus on the complex vocal climax at the end, made even more powerful by the understated piano part. Elsewhere, in a loving rendition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>’s “Win,” Chris Connolly's piano is the perfect accompaniment, alternating between jazzy, downtempo verses and bold choruses. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other songs lack these dynamics, like the pleasant but unimaginative redos of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22059-roy-harper/"">Roy Harper</a>'s “Another Day,” and the aforementioned Seger cover. Although the latter’s lyrics are a perfect fit for Kozelek’s recent turn toward rambling recollection, the performance feels characterless. While the best of Kozelek’s cover songs found him refitting the songs to suit his particular guitar tunings and vocal style, the arrangements here are mostly identical to their originals. Who would have listened to his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22438-acdc/"">AC/DC</a> covers album if he had just strummed power chords and hummed along? On </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Favorites</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, it’s as if Kozelek just wandered into a piano bar, handed over a stack of sheet music, and hit record.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At its best, the casual atmosphere makes for one of Kozelek’s loosest, lightest collections to date: something to throw on when you don’t have the emotional capacity for his more distinctive albums. And while Kozelek’s weary, grumbly voice has helped to give a sense of depraved intensity to his last few releases, it sounds prettier here than it has in a while, thanks in part to the inherent melodicism of the songs he picked for the project. Still, for an artist whose cover songs used to reveal multitudes about the performer, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Favorites</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> mostly feels self-serving. Maybe that’s why he chose to start the set off with “Send in the Clowns,” a wry song of wasted love and regret. Coming from a 49-year-old guy who, with every new release, seems increasingly uninterested in pleasing anyone but himself, it also plays as a sort of non-apology. “My fault, I fear,” Kozelek sings, “I thought that you wanted what I wanted—sorry my dear.” What follows is a collection of songs that is unlikely to become anybody’s favorite: just more proof that Mark Kozelek Sings Whatever the Hell He Wants.</span></p></div>"|21944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21944-mark-kozelek-sings-favorites/|5.5|Sam Sodomsky

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Above all else, Holy Fuck are a </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">rhythm </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">band, and much of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Congrats </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">has them circling back to where they started in 2005, i.e., a dance-punk band in a literal sense, trying to approximate electronic music with live instrumentation (and some </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">non</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-instruments), to be as pummeling as they are danceable. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Congrats </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is a record that rarely lets up, but there’s a sense of humor creeping in somewhere, mostly in the titles—on “Neon Dad,” they imagine themselves as a musclebound chillwave act and the synth-bass of “Caught Up” is a sincere homage to early-'00s DFA.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holy Fuck never sound out of their element on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Congrats—</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the most surprising addition is an acoustic guitar on the “Shimmering” interlude. But even at less than a minute, “Shimmering” somehow exposes the ultimate issue with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Congrats </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and perhaps Holy Fuck as an enterprise.

Nearly five years after their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/"">self-titled debut album</a> marked the peak convergence of late-2000s bass music and its myriad influences—dubstep, R&amp;B, footwork, house, ambient, hardcore—the duo's second full-length returns to that once vital style to find it rendered prosaic. “Inside me, inside of you/I've been going backwards,” sings <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28783-body-language/"">Body Language</a>'s Angelica Bess amidst the swaying UK funky-lite of “Devil Inside.” It's surely all too perfect that she wraps up <i>Folding Time</i>'s complications so succinctly, and yet the music's dearth of adventure can only be traced to an unflinching myopia.</p>
<p>Maybe it's unfair to fault a rose for having thorns: Sepalcure offered such a gorgeous example of pancultural electronica in 2011 that they have every reason to reclaim their past successes. Besides, “Pencil Pimp” and “The One” aren't being rinsed for nostalgia just yet, so why not transpose their clubby effervescence and disembodied soul to another colorful, balanced stretch of tunes? These guys certainly have the fans for it, and the kind of dubwise dynamism in “Hearts in Danger,” “Loosen Up,” and “Brother Forest” is a textbook execution of hybrid sensibilities made seamless. But when those ideas sound underexplored (“Dub Of”), detached (“Hurts So Bad”), or superfluous (“Ask Me”), it's as if Sepalcure see their self-imposed genre as exemplary in electronic music's constantly changing ecosystem.</p>
<p>Stewart and Sharma have <a href=""https://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=34439"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> that <i>Folding Time</i>'s writing process was like “connecting the present with the past…digging through old memories.” How listeners interface with the refurbished music hinges on their value of that past and the currency it holds. The vocal samples in these tracks offer a reliable barometer in that regard (nothing says 2010 UK bass like an Aaliyah stand-in tossed over some kick-and-stick). Both Sepalcure and their solo projects, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2630-machine-drum/"">Machinedrum</a> and Braille, have always fixated on vocals—sampling the likes of Whitney Houston, Jocelyn Brown, Monica, and KC &amp; JoJo, among others—so their heavy presence is no surprise here. Unlike the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burials</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tets</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blakes</a> out there, however, Sepalcure have never been much for abstraction, lifting lyrics and their sentiments wholesale (maybe pitched down a couple steps) instead of flipping them into a unique translation. “Not Gonna Make It” grabs the opening line of Gladys Knight's “<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Lh4MFiw08"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neither One of Us</a>”</span>; “Been So True” samples liberally from “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGMInHRR2Fo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heard It All Before</a>” by Sunshine Anderson; hooky and animated as they are, neither song manages to speak new meaning from the vibrant source material. Such handling of samples can relegate empowering and soul-searching music to props for a stunt.</p>
<p><i>Folding Time</i>'s original vocals meet that issue head on. Canadian singer Rochelle Jordan and Brooklynite Angelica Bess each give a nuanced, personalized performance that nudges the music into a pop context. Whiffs of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28873-sbtrkt/"">SBTRKT</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/424-bonobo/"">Bonobo</a> linger in the lush, chilled-out motifs of “Fight for Us” and “Devil Inside,” but their dubby atmospheres and injured melodicism are Sepalcure hallmarks writ sync-friendly. The verse-chorus structures and downtempo arrangements don't offer a way forward for Stewart and Sharma so much as point towards an alternate space for their music to inhabit, well-adjusted and respectably commercial. Likewise, <i>Folding Time</i> serves as a stopgap for an aging sound without a firm grasp on its bearings. Should Sepalcure continue writing from their fixed point, they'll have to project further and further from its origin.</p></div>"|21958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21958-folding-time/|6.0|Patric Fallon

On paper, the short-lived band was just the latest in an erratic string of projects that the Memphis-based garage-punk wild man had been tearing through since the late ’90s, chief among them the </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29598-the-reatards/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reatards</span></a> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and the</span> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29732-lost-sounds/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lost Sounds</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">During that time, he always kept a handful of side projects on the back burner, but Angry Angles seemed different. When formed in 2005, immediately after the breakup of the Lost Sounds, Angry Angles seemed poised to become Reatard’s new big thing, the group that might propel him to the next level of cult infamy. Instead, the band imploded in 2006, leaving a trail of singles in its wake. </span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Angry Angles </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">collects those singles, along with previously unreleased bonus material, and as such it comprises the entire studio output of Angry Angles. Seventeen songs nailed to the wall in a little over a year is nothing to sneeze at—and neither are the songs themselves, despite spackling the slim gap between the Lost Sounds and Reatard’s storied solo career, launched in ’06 and cut short by </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37575-rip-jay-reatard/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">his death</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in 2010. With bassist/singer Alix Brown (cofounder with Reatard of the indie label Shattered Records) and alternating drummers Paul Artigues and Ryan Rousseau (the latter a Reatards alum) in tow, Reatard synthesized everything he’d done up to that point. Borrowing some of the Lost Sounds’ retro-new-wave roboticism, but rendered in a more vivid, visceral Reatards-esque spew, Angry Angles tracks like “Crowds” and “Apparent-Transparent” are lobotomized post-punk, whiplash anthems for 21st-century dehumanization.</span></p>
<p> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Apparent-Transparent” also features one of Brown’s most striking vocal performances, a voice-processed call-and-response with Reatard that pays unabashed homage to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"">Devo</a>. There’s an actual Devo cover on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Angry Angles</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as well, a beautifully bruised rendition by Brown of “Blockhead,” along with reverential versions of classics by </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wire</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (“The 15th”), the Urinals (“Black Hole”), and Reatard’s mentor Greg Oblivian (“Memphis Creep” by the </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31293-the-oblivians/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oblivians</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">).</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Churned together, these four bands pretty much comprise</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reatard’s chemical makeup—not that he was ever shy about his influences, or his hooks. There are some great ones on these songs: the scabbed pop-punk of “Stab You Dead” for one, or “Can’t Do It Anymore,” which mixes feral riffage with a singsong chorus designed to stick in the head like a pickaxe. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two versions of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18059-angry-angles-things-are-moving/"">Things Are Moving</a>” are included here, but they’re anything but redundant. On the original single version, distortion is smeared across Reatard’s manic chants and punch-drunk guitar; on the abridged alternate version, that noise is whittled to a finer point. “Things are moving around me all the time,” Reatard howls on both. It sums up exactly where he was circa-Angry Angles. His romantic relationship with Brown ended the same time the band did, leaving him to pour his scattershot energy into his burgeoning solo career. Brown moved on to </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28507-golden-triangle/"">Golden Triangle</a>,</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">then a DJ career; Rousseau moved back to his home state of Arizona to revive the formidable </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31063-destruction-unit/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Destruction Unit</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (an outfit Reatard was originally a part of). And Reatard funneled his turmoil into his 2006 breakthrough solo album, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21714-blood-visions/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blood Visions</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, an album that sounds more and more like a masterpiece as time goes by. <i>Angry Angles</i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is a blurry, inconsistent snapshot of his liminal state between dude-in-a-million-bands and burgeoning solo icon—ragged here, refined there, and brimming with vitality.</span></p></div>"|21975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21975-angry-angles/|7.6|Jason Heller

He’s released his latest mixtape, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Murder For Hire 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, only four months after his exceptional major label debut, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Islah</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, which is quietly one of the best-selling rap albums of the year thus far, and clearly among the best-made ones. Gates took a sideways route to commercial success, amassing a devoted cult following through his plainspoken and unflinchingly honest raps and a prickly online presence that’s just as confounding. “You know I got a lot of record labels tryin' to sign me / They say if I'm a risk, it's detrimental to the profit,” he rapped on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Murder For Hire</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> closer “Khaza.” But his antics haven’t even moderately budged the bottom line, and this sequel is further evidence of a winning formula: stay true to yourself and deliver a reliable product.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Murder For Hire 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> serves as both a true followup to its predecessor and an </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Islah</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> epilogue. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are lots of similar flourishes to the latter—haunting piano keys, dips into gravelly singsong, and some dynamic cadences—but it models the former’s loose structure, playing like a compilation of B-sides or outtakes from the </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Islah</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sessions. Even so, it’s quite a formidable collection of records with some of the rapper’s most forceful and vital flows. Over time, Gates has slowly grown as comfortable in his stylistic tendencies as he is in his own skin; he knows exactly what a good Kevin Gates song sounds like and the specific set of ingredients that go into making one. His acute eye for detail is as effective reliving addiction (“Great Example”) as it is recounting old gun fights. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Off Da Meter” finds Gates at his most complex, measuring his rising fame against the sadness set upon him by a grief-stricken life (In the hook, he sings, “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting 50 Gs a feature, my show price is going up / </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hard to deal with this depression lately I've been throwing up” before later delivering the equally complicated appraisal: “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">God love his children, he's awesome / He sent me an angel who's flawless / Got shot in my mouth in '05 / Knocked out my teeth, it was awful</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">”). Kevin Gates is often best playing the fragile thug, letting his shortcomings manifest as bite-sized ugly truths in passing, and on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">MFH2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> he plays up this dichotomy. “The Prayer,” aptly produced by the Villains, revisits facing 25-to-life as a 25-year-old hustler, chastising the futility of “internet beef” in the process. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On “Lil Nigga,” a song devoted to camaraderie, he professes his affection for those in his inner circle, then, within seconds, he tracks down and nabs the man that shot him, dispensing his own brand of street justice. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He tightropes the divide between hardcore goon and thoughtful companion better than any of his peers, even making the gap indistinguishable at times. ""Believe in Me"" is vintage Kevin Gates: raw to the point of being tender and exposed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The hooks aren't quite as catchy or well-written on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Murder For Hire 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as they have been in recent months, and he phones it in on ""Fuck It,"" which repurposes OT Genasis' ""Cut It"" into a rather bland and affectless replica, but overall the tape is a welcome addition to the Gates canon. It works well as a snack-sized accompaniment to the bigger prize. Just because Gates is only a few months removed from the biggest success of his career doesn’t mean there’s even the slightest chance that he plans on slowing down. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Moving on, better thoughts, cleaner weed, cleaner living / Kitchen bags at the cleaners, even made a cleaner killing,” he raps on “Showin' Up,” continuing to push onward and upward, carrying his momentum forward. He’s an unstoppable force with an indomitable will, and he’s on the verge of becoming rap’s brightest sleeper star.</span></p></div>"|21957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21957-murder-for-hire-2/|7.4|Sheldon Pearce

She got her start singing on William Orbit's chillout project Strange Cargo, and she lent her voice to two songs on the Chemical Brothers' <i>Exit Planet Dust</i>, placing her smack in the middle of British pop's volatile post-rave milieu. When her 1996 breakout album, <i>Trailer Park</i>, appeared, it balanced plaintive acoustic guitars and barroom piano with trip-hop beats and atmospheric electronic detailing. That unusual fusion had a lot to do with producer Andrew Weatherall, whom Orton hired after he wedded acid house to bluesy psych rock on Primal Scream's <i>Screamadelica</i>. But <i>Trailer Park </i>ended up being an outlier in Orton's catalog. On subsequent albums she progressively dialed back the electronics, and her last full-length, 2012's starkly acoustic <i>Sugaring Season</i>, wrapped itself snugly in the warm, homespun mantle of folksingers like Nick Drake and Sandy Denny.</p>
<p><i>Kidsticks</i> returns to her electronic roots, but not necessarily in ways that anyone might have expected. Written and produced in Los Angeles with Andrew Hung, of the noisy, psychedelic synth-mashers Fuck Buttons, it often sounds little like anything Orton has done before. The record's sequencing plays up its strangeness, placing its most unexpected songs right up front. “Snow” leads off with caterwauling counterpoints and flanged electric guitars over a trashcan drum corps; “Moon” follows with dance beats and a warbling keyboard melody that's a dead ringer for a sound from David Bowie's “Ashes to Ashes.” Orton, meanwhile, sounds like she's channeling Johnny Cash, lending to the impression that part of the album's genesis may have simply been Orton and Hung swapping the aux cord, constructing a virtual mood board of favorite songs as they sketched out <i>Kidsticks</i>' idiosyncratic sound. That might how the dubstep-inspired bass throb of “Petals” snuck through, not to mention the peppy new wave pastiche of ""1973."" Fortunately, most of these songs are far more than the sum of their influences: “Petals” may start out sounding like Massive Attack, but by its guitar-and-drum-duel finale, it burns like a church on fire.</p>
<p>It helps that Orton and Hung have enlisted a crack group of musicians, including bassist Bram Inscore, jazz drummer Guillermo E. Brown, percussionist Lucky Paul, and George Lewis, Jr. of Twin Shadow on guitar; Grizzly Bear bassist Chris Taylor also turns up on a couple of songs, and the soundtrack composer Dustin O'Halloran contributes string arrangements to a few more. Their contributions are subtle but key. The rolling “Wave” crests atop a deceptively potent rhythm section and surging wah-wah guitar; “Flesh and Blood” gives her pastoral tendencies a loose, jammy makeover and adds lilting, one-finger synth lines. The scope of her collaborators' resumes—Inscore has played with Beck and Charlotte Gainsbourg, and Brown has a long history with David S. Ware and Matthew Shipp's groups, while Paul can be found sitting in with Chilly Gonzales and Mocky—says something about Orton and Hung's approach here: <i>Kidsticks </i>is less a roadmap to a given destination than a net for catching vibes.</p>
<p>As for Orton, loosening up suits her well. You can tell how much she's enjoying herself by all the ways she experiments with her voice. She takes on three or four different styles in “Snow,” alternately cooing and yelping, playing head voice off chest voice. On “Wave,” her delivery frays around the edges, inseparable from the throat that produced it; every crack, every quaver feels like a proud badge of her years on the planet. She's just as physical on “Flesh and Blood,” but here, in contrast, she sounds absolutely luxurious, with a texture like crushed velvet.</p>
<p>Lyrically, the big themes hold sway. She fixates on celestial bodies and planetary forces: suns, moons, stars, seas, smoke, snow, waves, weather. She swims through a liquid sky on ""1973""; lilacs turn to teardrops in ""Petals."" But she also has an ear for small, lovely details, like ""corduroy legs running up the stairs,"" the image that gives shape to “Corduroy Legs,” a delightful, boundless expression of parental love. And if her lyrics sometimes read like the work of someone who's coming off a lost weekend of tarot cards and John Donne, she also knows when to strip back: In “Falling,” she sings, with devastating simplicity, “Now my phone book / Is filling up with dead friends / And I wonder / Who would answer if I called them.”</p>
<p>Throughout it all, a picture emerges of Orton that's anxious, playful (“You got a certain way, I swear, of sticking it in,” she leers on “1973”), and even supremely relatable. There are love songs here, and falling-out-of-love songs, and sometimes it takes a while to tell which is which. The twist in a song called “Falling” is that she's “falling backwards from your arms”; in “Dawnstar,” she sings, “Our love is gaining speed,” but she also admits, “I am thankful that what I have is enough.” Escape velocity is for the young, I think she's saying; once you reach a certain stage in life, you're happy just to keep going. And if this all sounds like a case of lowered expectations, the strikingly beautiful “Flesh and Blood,” the album's peak, turns simple acceptance—of “whatever this is,” as she sings, over and over—into something approaching ecstasy.</p>
<p>Looking back on <i>Trailer Park</i>, Orton told <i>The Quietus </i>in 2009, “I thought, well, if I really am a singer… I must create my own thing and do it, only then will I prove it. But even today I'm still proving it to myself.” But on <i>Kidsticks</i>, she no longer sounds like she has anything left to prove, which is precisely what's allowed her to make the riskiest album of her career. And she sounds like she's had the time of her life making it, too.</p></div>"|21917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21917-kidsticks/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

They prefer the much more neutral descriptor “band.” Still, it’s impossible to separate the group from their other projects. Any band featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1832-rachel-goswell/"">Rachel Goswell</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"">Mogwai</a>’s Stuart Braithwaite, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1426-editors/"">Editors</a> guitarist Justin Lockey (along with his brother James) is going to carry certain expectations, and on their self-titled debut they live up to each and every one of them. <br/> <br/> The album’s creation involved a lot of emailing back and forth between members before some of them had even met, sort of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"">Postal Service</a> situation only with a lot more CC’s. “We didn’t record in the same room, or at the same time,” they write in the album’s liner notes, “to be honest we probably didn’t start off with the same vision.” Shared visions are irrelevant, though, when you have a lineup of players with such defined lanes. The album’s sound feels preordained: Slowdive’s sighing shoegaze, Mogwai’s cinematic wanderlust, and Editors’ gloomy riffage are all represented, and in more or less equal measure. <br/> <br/> If there’s one thing all three of those bands have in common, it’s that you if you’re reading this site you probably know what they all sound like, but you probably can’t hum any of their songs off the top of your head. That’s not a knock; like a lot of acts from their respective scenes, those groups prioritized aesthetic statements over strong songwriting voices. That sonics-first mindset inevitably carries through Minor Victories, too. On opener “Give Up the Ghost,” Goswell sings broodingly about black roses and the blood surging through her veins, but it’s mostly an excuse for the song’s gothy ambiance, buzzsaw guitars, and moody orchestral accents. “A Hundred Ropes” and “Folk Arp” are even more sweeping, with even more dramatic string arrangements. Everybody in the group clearly knows their way around a studio, and the album rarely sounds less than superb.<br/> <br/> What’s missing, though, is the central promise of a supergroup: the thrill of hearing established musicians in a truly different context. Minor Victories’ lineup may stem from different circles, but their approaches are so complementary that there’s rarely any tension or surprise. Unsurprisingly, then, the album’s most memorable tracks each introduce an X factor. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5025-the-twilight-sad/"">Twilight Sad</a>’s James Graham gamely duets with Goswell on “Scattered Ashes (Song for Richard),” a pop number with handclap drums and a blissfully fuzzy riff that imagines a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"">Jesus and Mary Chain</a> cover of “Dancing in the Dark.” Then, a couple of tracks later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"">Mark Kozelek</a> joins her for what’s essentially a stowaway <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"">Sun Kil Moon</a> song, “For You Always.”<br/> <br/> It’s at once completely out of place, completely obnoxious, and completely welcome. Kozelek goes into full <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji/""><i>Benji</i></a> overshare mode, rattling off a flood of dates and locations with almost obsessive, journalistic detail. “We met once in Los Angeles just around the time of the Columbine murders and Mojave 3 were playing on Sunset Boulevard at Tower Records…” he sings (well, sort of sings), recounting his 20-year friendship with Goswell and its periodic romantic undertones. For her verses, Goswell mirrors his wordy delivery, and though she can match neither the grace nor the clumsiness of his prose, it’s exciting to finally hear her outside her element. Like everything Kozelek has a hand in, it’ll drive some listeners absolutely nuts. But in one song he does what <i>Minor Victories</i> manages only intermittently: He makes a lasting impression.</p></div>"|21943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21943-minor-victories/|6.0|Evan Rytlewski

Isn’t that how most people choose to remember pop songs anyway? Angel Du$t isn’t the first band to come up with this idea, but whereas most bands of this sort come off like hardcore acts dabbling in pop, <i>Rock the Fuck on Forever </i>is the exact opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hell, this isn’t the first time they tried either, though 2014’s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A.D. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">seems like an obvious dry run in retrospect. At the time, Angel Du$t were a relatively melodic hardcore band, but they didn’t sound ready to embrace it as their definitive aspect. Fortunately, they were emboldened by its positive underground reception. In an interview from last year, the incredibly well-named</span> <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/road-justice-trapped-under-ice-and-angel-dut-frontman-on-life-in-the-van-the-return-of-tui-and-more"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Justice Tripp said</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;""> “I think in 2015, you can do whatever you want and most hardcore kids will at least try it out.” His native Baltimore is having a bit of a moment right due to a couple of hardcore bands that go far outside of the genre’s strictures. In addition to Angel Du$t, <a href=""http://reactrecords.bandcamp.com/album/leave-it-all-behind"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Praise</a> skews emo in a way similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31620-title-fight/"">Title Fight</a>, and the rapidly ascendant <a href=""https://turnstilehc.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Turnstile</a> could pass for an aggro 311 or unwoke Rage Against the Machine at times. Angel Du$t itself contains members of Turnstile and fist-swinging traditionalists <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zau_a8e8mY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trapped Under Ice</a>.</span></p>
<p>Angel Du$t still love themselves some hardcore bluster—“Rectify” sounds awful cheerful about the ass-kicking you've got coming your way, Tripp’s pretty sure everyone’s kinda full of shit (“Somebody Else”) and life is kinda pointless (“Headstone”). It’s kind of a posture, though: Tripp sings with a chest-puffing huff and enunciates so every lyric is completely understandable. It’s musclebound and also lovably cartoonish, like being menaced by Zangief from <i>Street Fighter </i>or something<i>. </i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The power of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rock the Fuck on Forever </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">actually lies in its love songs. The band describes themselves as a cross between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4936-the-lemonheads/"">the Lemonheads</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/275-bad-brains/"">Bad Brains</a>, essentially meaning they play goofy pop songs about how much they like girls and/or how much they wish a girl would like them back at extremely fast tempos. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/841-a-look-into-the-future-of-producer-will-yips-studio-4/"">Will Yip</a>’s production tends to be divisive in punk circles, but there’s no denying his ability to make bands in this realm sound like they could’ve snuck into a 1995 alt-rock station if things broke right; the stuttering vocals from  “Ready 2 Receive U” and “Upside Down” imagine if Cloud Nothings followed their pop-punk muse and worked with Rob Cavallo rather than Steve Albini. In other words, they’re about halfway between </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pinkerton </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Smash</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s Angel Du$t’s best trick, but it’s not their only one—there’s nods at surf-rock (“Bad Thing”), rap-metal non-sequitur (“Toxic Boombox”), and classic hardcore <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM2RY0bZalI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hxc</a> call-and-response (“Hurt You Bad”).

He's made power pop and indie rock, but since going solo in 2010 he's been making his twist on classic country. He might not be tearing up the Stateside country charts, but his new <i>Mosey</i> still makes for a solid entry in the new-school canon of hybrid country. Rather, Romano’s fifth full-length under his own name finds him relying on classic flourishes to build simple songs that look to the great beyond.</p>
<p>For the duration of its dozen songs, <i>Mosey</i> is married to the aesthetics of a forgotten B-movie about the wild West. Romano’s voice sounds weary, the guitars are all a little fried, and mariachi-style brass seals the deal. Psychedelia seeps in, too, for a hazy fever-dream finish. The resulting LP sounds like a dusty, abandoned postcard, a yellowed “wish you were here!” that curls at the corners.</p>
<p>“Valerie Leon” gets the record off to a scorching start, in which Romano races through a near-breathless yarn about a forbidden love that becomes a different sort of disaster—getting what you want doesn’t always yield the best results, it seems. But the bright chorus enlivens the song and makes it sound like a wry joke of sorts. Romano offers an intense triple stack of loneliness toward the middle of the record: “One Hundred Regrets Avenue” sounds hopeless, thanks in part to Romano’s off-kilter piano lines, while “I’m Alone Now” and “Sorrow (For Leonard and William)” trade in melancholy malaise even as they swing and shuffle.</p>
<p><i>Mosey</i> isn’t all gloom, though it boasts plenty of excellent bummer songs. “Toulouse” is a cheeky, slinky number that finds Rachel McAdams adding wobbly hound-dog “woo”s and breathy lines in French, and “Hunger Is a Dream You Die In” is beguiling in its measured patter. There, Romano sounds barely patient as he contemplates growth and solitude: “Somethin’ in you’s not the same, when there’s no one to share your pain.” <i>Mosey</i> speaks to restless, if uncertain, ambition: you know you <i>need</i> to go, but you’re not sure where or how to get there. </p></div>"|21956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21956-mosey/|7.1|Allison Hussey

While embodying Dee Dee, Welchez's cool was effortless, as all cool should be; she could have been born with crimson lipstick and a glossy pair of Ray-Bans sitting perfectly parallel to her incredible black bangs. Now, she has re-reinvented herself as Kristin Kontrol, and her first solo record </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">X-Communicate </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is a total 180 from her work with DDG, eschewing guitar music for the sleekest synthpop imaginable.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Saying that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">X-Communicate</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> only takes its strongest moments from '80s pop would be pigeonholing, but it's undeniable that shades of that decade permeate the record from start to finish. The chorus to “Skin Shed” could almost be a lost Kylie Minogue classic, even down to Welchez's vocal delivery, and the backing harmonies on tracks like “Drive the Night” are straight out of Go-Go's/Bangles/Bananarama territory. If Kristin Kontrol ever does truly hit the mainstream, it could be with “What Is Love,” a song that makes use of the trickiest and most show-stopping of '80s songwriting staples—the power ballad—to tremendous effect. Every single moment is accounted for and brought to completion, from the simple piano melodies of the song's beginning to the stadium-anthem finish.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Luckily, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">X-Communicate</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> avoids superficiality and mimicry by also adding liberal doses of '70s rock and '90s indie and alt-rock, like on “Face 2 Face,” a mid-tempo number that would have easily fit into 120 Minutes rotation circa '96. There are even tinges of contemporary pop where necessary (the saxophones on the impeccable “White Street” could conceivably be described as “Jepsen-esque”). Other than Welchez, there are two notable creative forces behind </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">X-Communicate</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: producers Kurt Feldman (who fronts synth band Ice Choir and used to be a member of both the Depreciation Guild and The Pains of Being Pure at Heart) and Andrew Miller, who was the Dum Dum Girls' final guitarist. The pair's extensive knowledge of pop production is an instrument in itself, and one that, along with Welchez's well-honed songwriting, lifts </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">X-Communicate</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> far beyond mere revivalism.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The album's title track is the culmination of all these elements, a polished four minutes full of bleating keyboards and driving drum machines that conjure a midnight drive through L.A. It does what pop songs do best: Take a moment and blow it up to its largest possible size for all to enjoy. In any genre, it’s a difficult task to make music for an informed audience that is both referential without being derivative, exciting without cloyness. Yes, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">X-Communicate</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> could be a better record: It could reach further beyond the sound that defines it; it could work harder to analyze and skewer some of the tropes that end up supporting it. However, sticking the landing on a musical pivot this total is an impressive feat, and ultimately, the album’s minor shortcomings become admissible next to its higher moments. The clear ambition of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">X-Communicate</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is to leave Welchez’s old persona behind and emerge, fresh and new, as something completely different, and by and large, that objective is achieved.</span></p></div>"|21891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21891-x-communicate/|7.5|Cameron Cook

Every review of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Dream is Over </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is obligated to mention the inspiration behind the album title—after literally shredding his vocal cords, Stefan Babcock was told by a doctor, <a href=""http://diymag.com/2016/03/01/pup-interview-the-dream-is-over-in-the-studio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“the dream is over.”</a> The irony is that Babcock would’ve told you the same thing at any point in the past two years if he never set foot in the office.

<p>Babcock’s homicidal thoughts are countered by panicked, massed vocals that double as restraining orders—“WHY CAN’T WE JUST GET ALONG?” “WHY CAN’T EVERYBODY JUST CHILL?!??” Notice that there’s never any threat to turn the damn van around or just break up. Judging by their insane touring regimen and adrenalized music, this a band that believes it can power through anything by sheer force of will. But even if being in PUP sounds like a living nightmare for Babcock, it’s all he’s got. Gig or no gig, he’s waking up most mornings on the floor with more apologies than dollars in the bank, coming to the same conclusion over and over again: that voice in my head telling me I’m a loser was right all along.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But, as Patrick Stickles once sang, <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikE_-iilnQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that’s OK</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Now that you’ve finally figured me out/I can go home and rest easier now,” Babcock brays on “Doubts,” one of the many songs on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Dream is Over </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">which retells an involuntary romantic/vocational break up. “What am I supposed to do now?” he asks and it’s not a rhetorical question; </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Dream is Over </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is weirdly pragmatic about hitting bottom. It’s heartening to see PUP’s realm become <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1155-modern-baseball-and-how-emo-grew-up/"">more mature, mindful and socially conscious</a>, but being constantly broke, hungover and miserable </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fucking sucks </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and there’s no way around it.  There’s a “don’t fight it, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feel it</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,” philosophy to PUP’s music, validating these emotions with an unapologetically </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">nasty </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">record that lets you work out all of your angst in a safe place.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Babcock yells, “I’ve been blessed with this shit luck,” a sentiment that typically traces back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"">the Replacements</a>, the patron saints of lovable loser punk. But Babcock’s misery has nothing to do with luck and everything to do with decisions (“And I’m sick and tired of blacking out on my carpet/And waking up all on my own/So I brought you home"") and PUP’s music is more based in hyper-aggressive post-hardcore and skate-punk. Babcock’s vocals are clean, yelpy and sing-song melodic, justifying PUP's brief spell on the Warped Tour, but the music takes after the precise assault of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1152-drive-like-jehu/"">Drive Like Jehu</a> in the gymnastic chorus of “Doubts,” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a> at their most manic (“Sleep in the Heat”), and the hectoring bass assaults of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2720-mclusky/"">Mclusky</a> (“Old Wounds”). There’s enough self-deprecation to ensure that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Dream is Over</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> never sounds hateful, but the physical violence of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6UaplvdnWM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Reservoir”</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IM472k0Md8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“If This Tour Doesn’t Kill You, I Will”</a> videos isn’t entirely played for laughs. Someone is going to get hurt here. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s all very effective because the ultimate message is “misery loves company.” Though a far more accomplished and tuneful record than their debut, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Dream Is Over </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feels just as much a preview for PUP’s live show. Whereas most music of this sort never tries to sound like more than a couple guys in a room, PUP’s approach is so over-the-top that it can sound as CGI’d as any chart-pop; you have to see it in person just to find out if they can really pull this off. Can they </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">really </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">nail the heart-stopping segue between “If This Tour Doesn’t Kill You” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17950-pup-dvp/"">“DVP”</a>?  How can anyone play as melodically and as </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fast </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">as they do on “DVP”? On every single chorus, the four members of PUP sound like 4000, is that really how it comes off in a room or is it because they rightfully expect everyone in the crowd to shout along? Frankly, the energy and intensity that’s channeled into the first half of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Dream is Over </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feels utterly impossible, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">especially </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">given the subject matter.</span></p>
<p>But even at 31 minutes, Babcock’s relentless self-loathing can go from intoxicating to simply toxic; it’s fitting that “My Life is Over and I Couldn’t Be Happier” and “Can’t Win” are immediately followed by a song called “Familiar Patterns.” Babcock finally steps out of himself on the closing “Pine Point.” Inspired by the 2011 interactive web documentary<i><a href=""http://pinepoint.nfb.ca/#/pinepoint"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Welcome to Pine Point</a>,</i> Babcock looks back and remembers his brother dying in a drunken car crash, walks around the abandoned Northwest Territories mining town and sees Pine Point as a fate far worse than death or even his current situation (""Imagine if your hometown never changed"" goes the tagline). As a sort of pop-punk Greek chorus, the band repeats “I hope you know what you’re doing” over anxious minor chords, cautionary advice that had about as much impact on them as “the dream is over.” They’ve tried so hard and got so far only to find out in the end, it doesn’t even matter.  So the only thing to do is keep moving—if that tour didn’t kill PUP, nothing will.</p></div>"|21718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21718-the-dream-is-over/|7.8|Ian Cohen

In preparing for the album, the conservatory-educated musician made a habit of frequenting events like François Kevorkian's Sunday-night Deep Space parties at New York's Cielo club, where she would dance, Shazam, and, above all, listen closely to the inner workings of what she heard. (She made these research trips alone, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/line-noise-podcast/line-noise-episode-07-olga-bell-colundi-sequence-and-how-we-got-into-electronic-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she says</a>, in order to avoid the distractions that would have accompanied going with friends.) Back in her studio, she browsed producers' forums to find out which VSTs young EDM producers currently favor—""I wanted to use sounds that I thought of as really commercial and almost kind of gross,"" she says—and she wrote out measure-by-measure transcriptions of vintage songs like Snap!'s classic ""Rhythm Is a Dancer"" and 2 Bad Mice's ""Like It Deep,"" the better to understand their structural underpinnings.</p>
<p>But if this all sounds very academic, the project was motivated by a far simpler impulse: The desire to make joyful, body-moving music. She was especially inspired by the way that different tempos evoke different physical responses, so she began most songs by deciding which tempo matched her mood that day—hence the album's title—and then letting the music come to her as the metronome tick-tocked steadily away. The process yielded an array of rhythms across the spectrum, from woozy trip-hop to peak-time house to 160-BPM footwork.</p>
<p>The results resemble dance music as glimpsed through a funhouse mirror: strangely distorted, sometimes goofy, and deeply pleasing on a simple, almost childlike level. Pitch-shifted voices zoom across the stereo field like unknotted balloons, and bursts of tuned 808 toms and rimshots chatter like wind-up teeth. Common dance music tropes get magnified to exaggerated proportions: Trap finger-snaps echo through hangar-sized reverb in ""ATA,"" and in the giddy ""Randomness,"" trance stabs and synthesizer leads congeal into an ungainly heap, like a Jell-O mold filled with Eurodance. The bridge of ""Power User"" turns hip-hop's call to throw your hands up into a sing-song jump-rope rhyme. Stylistically, the music has little in common with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19166-olga-bell-krai/"">Край</a>; </i>last year's <i>Incitation</i> EP anticipates <i>Tempo</i>'s electronic palette but not its spunky sense of play. But what unites the three records is Bell's evident delight in the plasticity and malleability of sound. She's particularly fond of portamento, the effect that connects a run of notes in a long, sweeping motion, which she applies liberally to synths and voice alike, giving her melodies a springy, elastic sense of movement.</p>
<p>Bell may have trained as a pianist, but she proves to be a formidable singer: expressive, playful, inventive, and acrobatic without being showy. Just listen to the finely calibrated timing and the carefully cracked pitch of the way she sings, ""You sulk, sit alone in a bar / Looking a little like a punchline, buddy"" (from ""Power User,"" which is decidedly <i>not </i>a toast for the douchebags). She can go from operatic finesse to a conspiratorial whisper in a single phrase, and she's never too polished to make time for hiccups, chuckles, and vocal fry. In fact it's often her voice that carries the day: Subtract the synths and beats from the gooey R&amp;B jam ""Zone,"" and the tune would hold up just fine as an a cappella, her multi-tracked harmonies stretched across the frame like a web of chewing gum.</p>
<p>Fortunately, despite <i>Tempo</i>'s unusual backstory, nothing here scans as ironic. And in a few cases, Bell's outsider-looking-in setup has little bearing on the music itself. ""Ritual,"" a full-blooded house anthem featuring the singer Sara Lucas (sounding a lot like Roísín Murphy in late-night-diva mode), wouldn't sound at all out of place on a crowded dancefloor at three in the morning. And the closing song, ""America,"" makes for an uneasy comedown from all the carefree hijinks that have preceded it. Over a minor-key dirge, she gives her adopted homeland a stern talking-to—""Is that what you fear? That you're not forever?""—while tremulous organs and gleaming sawtooths explode like a halftime show. In the song's refrain, she jams an extra pause into the world and accents the final syllable—""Ameri-<i>ca</i>""—to make it suddenly sound foreign and strange. If the message of the song is that we can't dance away the end of empire, there's a subtler truth being made here: that we can wear our otherness like a badge of pride.</p></div>"|21922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21922-tempo/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

You can hear that in his music: the whine of the engine and the wheels against the road; isolated notes bobbing in empty space like taillights streaking through the darkness; the steady pulse reminiscent of the rhythm of fluorescent lights passing overhead, all lines converging dimly on a distant vanishing point.</p>
<p>There were glimmers of it on his debut album, 2011's <i>Super Vato</i>, which spun bare-bones synth and drum tracks into rowdy, psychedelic club cuts that conveyed the manic rush of hallucinating at the wheel. But it really came together on his 2014 mix CD <i>Momento Drive</i>, particularly on a remarkably strange song he created for the mix, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAuqWyW32NQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Windsurf, Sunburn &amp; Dollar,”</a> in which he hollered the titular phrase in a throaty caveman howl—something more like “Windsor, sumble 'n' doar!”—over a beat that sounded like an electric guitar going up in flames, strings popping their coils as the whammy bar turned molten.</p>
<p>The same aesthetic defines <i>Mondo Alterado</i>, a new album of original material that has more in common with that mix CD than it does with his debut album. A DJ who is partial to psychedelic sets of mind-numbing duration—he and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4074-superpitcher/"">Superpitcher</a> played a 25-hour back-to-back set (as Pachanga Boys) in Mexico City a few years ago—Rebolledo has said that he only began producing in order to create the kind of material he was seeking for his sets but couldn't find elsewhere. In that sense, <i>Mondo Alterado </i>is a testament to the clarity of his vision. It unrolls like an impeccably thought-through DJ set, right down to the way tracks flow seamlessly from one to the next, with held notes or drumbeats acting as the glue that holds the pieces together.</p>
<p>Rebolledo's music has always been sparse, but on <i>Mondo Alterado</i>, it's more hypnotically hollowed-out than ever. “Spacer Rainbow Woman” is typical of his approach, as two spindly guitar notes and a gently swaying drumbeat are strung like a rope bridge across the void. A wordless sigh offers a suggestion of melody, and in the song's long plateau—you can't really speak of “peaks” in Rebolledo's work—a rubbery bass arpeggio creates rhythmic and harmonic tension. “Discótico Sinético” and “Discótico Estático” are similar: one-finger synth melodies, distant whoops and howls, lunkheaded rhythms heavy on cowbell and tom. “A Numb Gas to the Future” is even more minimal—a coldwave sketch and seven-minute palate-cleanser, connecting two of the album's highlights, “Fears Come True” and “Pow Pow.” (The latter is especially great, coming closest to the unhinged ecstasy of “Windsurf, Sunburn &amp; Dollar.”)</p>
<p>Nothing happens in a hurry here, and Rebolledo himself pokes fun at his music's humid languor in the title of the album's opening track, “Here Comes the Warrior (Super Short Album Version).” Its swirl of droning synths, tribal drums, and ululations goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour, and begs the question: What on earth must the <i>long </i>version be like? Which brings us to one of <i>Mondo Alterado</i>'s best qualities: its absurdist sense of humor. In “Life Is Strange, Life Is Hard, Life Is Great,” Rebolledo fills in the music's emptiness with a rambling monologue full of platitudes and positive affirmations, sounding like a self-help speaker that the denizens of Black Rock City have mistaken for an actual shaman as he builds to a tongue-in-cheek climax: “Never lose the faith, 'cause life is really great/Dance again/Dance again.”</p>
<p>Despite the lyrics' campy qualities, there's something <i>off </i>about them, something almost sinister, and that disturbing undercurrent carries into “Fears Come Through,” a dead-eyed protestation of unrequited love delivered over canned tambourines and Novocaine-drip synths. With a chorus that goes, “I don't want to be afraid to say I love you,” it's the creepiest anthem you're likely to hear on a dance floor all year.</p>
<p>Throughout this long, sidewinding album, you may  find yourself asking, <i>Is this guy for real</i>?—and that's precisely what makes Rebolledo's whole shtick so compelling. The music is enervating and exhilarating in equal measure, and it sounds unlike almost anything else in techno right now, save for similarly left-field primitivists like Barnt. <i>Mondo Alterado</i> isn't for everyone. But for those who like their techno with a healthy dose of deadpan, Rebolledo's unique strain of gonzo trance is all the fuel they need for a long trip to the far side of nowhere.</p></div>"|21786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21786-mondo-alterado/|7.4|Philip Sherburne

But it has definitely got them beat in sheer volume. The five-part series—which was posted to the UK-based electronic duo’s webstore last week—adds up to more than four hours of music, out-clocking its peers by a significant margin. Taken at once, <i>Elseq 1-5</i> is a mammoth hunk of listening, the IDM equivalent of<i> </i>a Netflix series binge. It is twice the length of Autechre’s last—and previously, lengthiest—album, 2013’s <i>Exai</i>. </p>
<p>Musically, the collection seems to advance the argument for Autechre as a sort of post-human jam band, with members Rob Brown and Sean Booth improvising at length within an opaque world of custom-designed music software. Free from the limitations of a physical format (there is currently no CD or vinyl release planned for <i>Elseq</i>), Autechre are free to sprawl and wander. And wander they do. <i>Elseq</i> <i>1-5</i> are as heady and frustrating as anything the duo have ever released. In some stretches, the music is glacial and serene (“eastre”). In others, the Brown and Booth’s violent squelches suggest machine-on-machine violence in the spirit of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_Research_Laboratories"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Survival Research Laboratories</a> (“c7b2”). Absorbing the whole thing requires a bit of commitment. Or maybe it just takes a giant bag of weed and a lot of free time. Thankfully, <i>Elseq</i> is also available to purchase in installments.</p>
<p>Active since the late ’80s, Autechre’s early full-lengths—<i>Amber</i>, <i>Tri Repetae—</i>could be more clearly understood in the context of dance music, as the duo relied on similar hardware, like drum machines and analog synthesizers. Even still, their output has always embraced and amplified electronic music’s eerie otherness. “We had heard these Latin Rascals edits with these fast bits with drums that sounded weirdly robotic, taking electro into this other zone,” Booth<a href=""https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/autechre-is-still-more-post-human-than-you-are"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> told Thump</a> last fall. “Half of the tracks that we do as Autechre are about recreating the actual sensations I used to get from those things—just getting post-human and next level.” As the years have passed, the duo’s music has become ever more idiosyncratic and abstract. The DNA of techno and electro are in there somewhere, but Booth and Brown have largely abandoned traditional melody and harmony in favor of raw sound design.</p>
<p><i>Elseq 1-5 </i>is not Autechre’s first foray into download-only releases. 2008’s <i>Quarstice</i> was followed by a series of digital EPs that offered expanded and alternate mixes, which were often superior to that album’s edited material. Last year, the duo posted a series of nine recent live recordings of new material for sale online. An important part of Autechre’s identity has been the duo’s willingness to mess with its audience’s perceptions. A track might register as repetitive, yet never actually repeat itself. Another might repeat the same phrase for 20 minutes at a stretch. Other works have been so chaotic that it is nearly impossible to retain them in your memory. </p>
<p>The set’s second installment is the most extreme, with Booth and Brown delving into crunchy, headache-generating digressions in 10-minute chunks that will feel either exhausting or exhilarating. “eastre” kicks off the third grouping with nearly a quarter-hour of droning, unearthly string tones. Not all of it is engaging, but if you ever wondered what it would really mean for Autechre to take an uninhibited plunge into the weirdo void, now you have your answer.</p>
<p><i>Elseq </i>feels like an advancement of the duo’s recent live sets, offering a similar ratio of rhythm to noise and order to chaos, but a richer palette of sounds. There aren’t a lot of melodies to be heard, but there are a number of distinctive tones and tricks—percussive thumps that sound like collapsing cardboard boxes, gritty woofer-busting bass tones. At the start of “pendulu hv moda” a reverb effect seems to move rapidly between wet and dry, spacious and tight, creating the dizzying sensation that space is expanding and contracting in time with the music. The best tracks land perfectly in the DMZ between the mechanical and musical. On “foldfree casual,” shimmering chords at first register as sentimental, but become more repetitive and emotionally vacant as they are pushed into the wings by jittery and alien rhythms.  </p>
<p>As a live act, Autechre is pretty much without parallel. In concert, the duo’s music feels un-gridded and spontaneous in a way that few computer or drum machine-backed performers can manage. In its best stretches, <i>Elseq</i> seems like a document of this aspect of Booth and Brown’s process – the part that’s just two dudes taking pleasure in real-time collaborative music making. Which, in a way, might serve to deflate the futuristic vibe a little. All talk of robots and post-humanity aside, it’s hard to think of anything quite as earthly as a jam session.</p></div>"|21950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21950-elseq-1-5/|7.0|Aaron Leitko

Which, in a way, might serve to deflate the futuristic vibe a little. All talk of robots and post-humanity aside, it’s hard to think of anything quite as earthly as a jam session.</p></div>"|21950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21950-elseq-1-5/|6.8|Aaron Leitko

Nitpicking can come from multiple directions—with one camp deriding a central lack of tension in the telling of an icon’s familiar story, and another wailing over any dramatic liberty taken with the historical record. Director and actor Don Cheadle’s new film about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a> plunges consciously and energetically into this fraught zone, not least because it dares to call itself <i>Miles Ahead</i> (aka the title of one of Davis’ great big band LPs). That titling move amounts to an open invitation to jazz whiners and/or experts everywhere.</p>
<p>As an actor, Cheadle looks and sounds the part. His styling is immaculate, and his voice channels Davis’ famous rasp. But at a level of sound, the two recordings that spring from Cheadle’s project face an even steeper challenge—simply because any re-appropriation of Davis’ music is a more precarious enterprise than acting out the life story. In this light, reporting that the original sounds created for (or inspired by) Cheadle’s film do not immediately register as embarrassments is a form of high praise.</p>
<p>The bulk of this film’s single-disc “original motion picture soundtrack” is built from brief dialogue snippets from the film (which are fine), select Davis cuts presented in full (“So What,” from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12283-kind-of-blue-50th-anniversary-edition/"">Kind of Blue</a></i>, naturally) and a few edits of classic Davis recordings (which should be avoided on general principle). Shaving down clips of Miles is a necessity of cinematic sound-design convention, and isn’t a mark against the film itself. But once you’re listening to a recording, outside the theater, I doubt even the filmmakers behind <i>Miles Ahead </i>would argue that it isn’t more important to seek out a complete, originally issued take. The soundtrack’s most interesting custom songs come toward the end of the album, where the film’s musical supervisor, keyboardist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33664-robert-glasper/"">Robert Glasper</a>, has the chance to offer four original pieces inspired by Davis’ protean example. And he makes each opportunity count.</p>
<p>“Junior’s Jam” has a spare funk indebted to Miles’<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2200-the-complete-jack-johnson-sessions/"">Jack Johnson</a></i> sessions (and fortunately the playing of Glasper, saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33669-marcus-strickland/"">Marcus Strickland</a>, and trumpeter Keyon Harrold doesn’t sound overly imitative). The chill of “Francessence” sounds equally inspired by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2199-the-complete-in-a-silent-way-sessions/""><i>In a Silent Way</i> </a>as well as latter-day film score work by the likes of Terence Blanchard. There’s a group rave-up meant to connote an active club feel (“What’s Wrong With That?”), and it includes some fiery soprano saxophone playing from onetime Davis band member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18931-wayne-shorter/"">Wayne Shorter</a>. And album-closer “Gone 2015” features joyously triumphant rhyming from the too-often overlooked Pharoahe Monch.</p>
<p>Working on the film seems to have given Glasper more ideas than could be included on the original soundtrack. So, with the permission of the Davis estate, he’s also created another full-length release that frequently uses the trumpeter’s recorded legacy as point of departure. More than a “remix” album, <i>Everything’s Beautiful</i> shows off Glasper’s skills with sampling, and his talent for creating original work. The pinnacle of the set comes on “Maiysha (So Long),” when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"">Erykah Badu </a>delivers original lyrics over Glasper’s playing and a sample of a Davis performance found on the album <i>Get Up With It</i>. And the keyboardist’s cover of “Milestones” proves that he doesn’t need access to the trumpeter’s tape-vault in order to create valid interpretations.</p>
<p>Glasper’s supporting cast draws from the range of talents he’s also employed on his reliably enjoyable <i>Black Radio</i> series of jazz-meets-R&amp;B fusion recordings. So in addition to Badu’s star turn, we get Phonte rapping over a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5501-9th-wonder/"">9th Wonder </a>production (during “Violets”), as well as the presence of vocalists like Bilal—whose phrasing and register-leaps animate the strut of “Ghetto Walkin’” (built from a groove Davis cut in 1969). The melisma and occasional grit of Ledisi’s voice drives “I’m Leaving You,” a song which also puts the spotlight on the guitar work of latter-day Davis collaborator John Scofield. </p>
<p>A trio of cuts toward the middle of <i>Everything’s Beautiful</i> suffers from feeling less robustly reimagined than the rest of the set—placing a slight drag on momentum. But there’s an easy fix: To experience the full range of the pianist’s Davis-derived thinking, just add Glasper’s contributions from the <i>Miles Ahead</i> soundtrack to <i>Everything’s Beautiful</i>. By being respectful of the artist’s legacy while also making some smart, contemporary production choices, Glasper’s best work proves an an ideal vehicle for paying tribute to an artist who had a firm feel for tradition, but who never stayed fixed in one place for very long.</p></div>"|21821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21821-everythings-beautiful-miles-ahead-ost/|7.4|Seth Colter Walls

Among the album's many highlights were the songs in which the duo brought in outside voices, such as the glorious Nancy Whang-assisted kiss-off ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15344-classixx-all-youre-waiting-for-ft-nancy-whang/"">All You're Waiting For</a>"" and the pre-sunrise melancholy of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15080-borderline-ft-kisses-jesse-kivel/"">Borderline</a>,” which featured an affecting performance from Kisses vocalist Jesse Kivel. These fleeting glimpses of the pop album Classixx might one day make were tantalized, and on their sophomore effort<i> Faraway Reach</i>, they plant their flag even firmer in straight-ahead pop. </p>
<p> Their songwriting remains a strong point, and Classixx continue to show a knack for choosing kindred-spirit collaborators. This time around, names that would appear in larger fonts on festival posters show up: Michael Angelakos of Passion Pit—whose has worked with dance producers before, appearing on last year's <i>Adventure</i>, the underrated debut from France's Madeon—drops by on “Safe Inside,” and his wide-eyed sincerity neatly aligns with Classixx's buoyant worldview.“I Feel Numb” is full-on disco, featuring a heart-on-his-sleeve vocal from Holy Ghost! frontman Alex Frankel.</p>
<p>“I am the one who makes you feel OK,” Frankel assures a concerned significant other as he warns them that he might be slipping into another depressive spell. It's an example of the world-weariness that suffuses the record—Frankel makes this person feel not good, not great, but just <i>OK</i>. And, as any adult will attest, sometimes OK is good enough. An album that recasts the dancefloor as a space to explore—and, crucially, attempt to combat—the malaise of adulthood, <i>Faraway Reach</i> concerns itself with less-than-glamorous topics ranging from depression (the aforementioned “I Feel Numb”), to mundane and banal activities like fighting with one's partner in line at the grocery store (“In These Fine Times”) and allowing of the pain of the past to inform but not define you (“Just Let Go,” which absorbs the anthemic qualities of big-tent EDM and features How to Dress Well aka Tom Krell in full-on diva mode to great effect).</p>
<p>Classixx redeems the bleakness of these topics with their natural sense of warmth—their music often feels like a familiar hand on your shoulder urging you to keep going. In hindsight, the sun-bleached vibes of <i>Hanging Gardens</i> played a role in the rise of tropical house, and the same laid-back tempos and vague hints of sea breeze  are found on <i>Faraway Reach</i>. But there's an inclusivity to Classixx, a sense of arms-outstretched welcoming that makes it impossible for anyone to turn their nose up at their music.</p>
<p>“I can do whatever I want,” warbles T-Pain on standout “Whatever I Want.” This confidence applies equally to his collaborators—in a nod to Michael David's birthplace of South Africa, Classixx effortlessly bring in Nonku, daughter of famed South African artist Ray Phiri, on “Ndivile.” And the album's wordless moments, of which there are only three, including tranquil opener ""Grecian Summer"" and the title track, demonstrate that Classixx haven't lost the ability to craft propulsive dance grooves, even if they're treated more as scene-setters and transitional tools. At various points, <i>Faraway Reach</i> is: a shrug; a call-to-arms; a balm. At its best, it's all these things at once.</p></div>"|21947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21947-faraway-reach/|7.7|Renato Pagnani

It was good company for him to be in, but even in that eclectic crowd he is an outlier. Whether as the Sun God, I.B.M., IAMTHATIAM, or most often as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33217-hieroglyphic-being/"">Hieroglyphic Being</a>, Moss' abundant discography is filled with so many u-turns that it begins to resemble a Spirograph. For every <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Hieroglyphic-Being-A-Synthetic-Love-Life-Studio-Sessions/release/2019893"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CD-R of synth squalls</a> there is another full of <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Hieroglyphic-Being-Cosmo-Rhythmatic/release/3133950"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">manic drum machine polyrhythms</a>. And then there was <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21130-we-are-not-the-first/"">We Are Not the First</a></i>, last year's meeting with an ensemble of free jazz’s finest, suggesting an imaginary space where the AACM gigged at Ron Hardy's Music Box.</p>
<p>Working with fellow producer Noleian Reusse as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33737-africans-with-mainframes/"">Africans With Mainframes</a>, now Moss swings from Windy City jazz to Chicago acid at its most caustic. While the duo have released a slew of 12”s dating back to 2001, <i>K.M.T.</i> is their first full-length. <i>Kemetic Modulating Textures</i> is eight tracks of Moss and Reusse at their most unrelenting and there’s a coarseness to every texture that at times might make you mistakenly think it was just slapped together. Yet the frequent references to Egyptology (Googling each track title reveals a profound knowledge of prehistoric culture) suggest a greater thought at work, and if you manage to survive the bruising BPMs of the album's first half, it becomes mesmerizing. </p>
<p>Opener “Anachronistic” sets the table for what lies ahead: everything in the red, a snare fill stumbling and slipping across the grid, the 808’s edges increasingly fuzzy with distortion. And then just when it verges on pure noise, that telltale acid squiggle worms through and the snare coheres into a visceral thrill. What might scan as sloppy and unfocused suddenly snaps into sharp relief and it’s effective throughout <i>K.M.T.</i>, album highlight “Negroid Spinx” being a fine example. It too features overdriven snares that concuss to the point of delirium and then at the 3:30 mark, Moss and Reusse drop out the beat and give us a brief respite, a glimpse of an oasis in the midst of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haboob"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">haboob</a>.</p>
<p>On the back half of the album, AWM relent and allow in more space. The epic “Qustal Artifacts” builds carefully, the track forgoing heavy beats for a heady array of arpeggios, the results not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a>, had they been Afrocentric rather than Germanic. “Naqada” and the title track sound like some tribal Folkways field recording rendered on machine rather than anything currently extant in electronic music.</p>
<p> Last year, Moss explained his first encounter with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"">Sun Ra</a>’s music as a shock to the system: “His music wasn’t about making sense: it was just about receiving these transmissions, this knowledge.” It’s a lesson that Moss carries forward with <i>K.M.T.</i>, suggesting that while some of his tracks might scan as scrambled transmissions, continued exposure reveals a profound signal beneath the noise. </p></div>"|21934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21934-kmt/|7.5|Andy Beta

At this point, however, it might not even be accurate to call them emo, so let’s just have it out now: The Hotelier is a great rock band, however you classify them. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is not to say </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Goodness </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">doesn't have its share of histrionics, though to be fair they are more like affirmations. <i></i>The album </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">flirts with transcendentalism, the 19</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">th</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-century philosophical movement favored by Emerson and Thoreau, which recognized the inherent goodness of humanity and the natural world while also placing a high value on fierce individuality. And so <i>Goodness</i> finds itself out in the fields of New England, stripping back to the essentials—trying to love and trust again, and finally moving the fuck on. Anyone who has attempted these things<b> </b>understands that they can rank among the most difficult emotional tasks, depending on how bad other humans have messed you up. <i>Home, Like NoPlace <i>Is </i>There</i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">took often-excruciating stock of that damage:</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> It opened with a suicide, lingered uncomfortably on a funeral scene, and reckoned with the psychological ravages of a lifetime of abuse. At times </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Goodness</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> pushes towards positivity with this same level of intensity</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, but it’s fraught with its own kind of tension: You can really <i>hear</i> the trying.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sometimes it’s grating, how hard </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Goodness </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">tries</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to find the light. The album is broken up with campfire-y interludes of peaceful chants atop acoustic guitar, which were “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sung under a total lunar eclipse in Plymouth, Vermont” according to official credits. We are also treated to a </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">recitation of the lullaby “I See the Moon,” Holden’s spoken-word introduction to the album, and “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a sound collage recorded of morning birds in Charlton, Massachusetts.” </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other times, it’s the trying that draws you in. The percussion is so relentless, the guitars so urgent, the voice so direct, that songs like “Goodness Pt. 2” and “Piano Player” feel like something that could get you out of bed in the morning. For much of the latter, Holden can be heard—in either the foreground or in the background amid utter sonic chaos—screaming what may be the most realistic mantra ever chanted: the word “sustain.” That said, this same sort of trick is not as profound the second time Holden pulls it, spending a fair chunk of “Sun” simply repeating its title. At least that underwhelming passage results in Holden’s most indelible punk vocal on the entire album, and it's a throaty blow that stands in stark contrast to the calmer, Stipe-like tone Holden employs here more than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For as riotous as it can sound, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Goodness </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is remarkably precise</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">in how it plays with dynamics and layers. This manifests in myriad ways: the music cutting out to emphasize Holden’s poetic pleas to feel alive, the disregard for traditional song structures, the way the two guitars have a near-constant interplay that adds dimensions (and hooks), and the slow and tense introduction of more instruments over the course of a song, like on the mortality-obsessed standout “Opening Mail for My Grandmother.”</span></p>

<p><i></i>It's an early peak. Unfortunately, it's also the most potent moment on the entire interminable run of <i>It Happened in Flatbush</i>, the Underachievers' first release since their 2015 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20998-evermore-the-art-of-duality/"">Evermore: the Art of Duality</a></i><i>. </i>Originally turning heads in 2013, the group seemed novel in a post-TDE/A$AP scene: A New York duo who weren't cheesy enough to insist on taking NY hip-hop back to some idealized ‘90s golden age, or desperate enough to hop the coattails of rap's latest trend. Though initially tethered to their vague mystical allusions (calling to mind ‘90s groups like Leaders of the New School) and a heady “conscious” vibe, they quickly settled into a comfortable role that didn't play up their Brainfeeder connections, or lyrically deviate <i>all that </i>differently from A$AP's “party and bullshit” ethos and Pro Era's nostalgia trips.</p>
<p>This continues on <i>It Happened in Flatbush</i>, which is a flat album in every way, no pun intended. None of the beats really knock, instead dutifully bopping along as the two MCs stick to forgettable, uninspired tropes about weed, women, and New York chest-thumping. For all the multi-syllabic bars about how much they're winning, <i>It Happened in Flatbush</i> can be dismissed with one word: <i>joyless</i>. There’s no spirit in any of these songs, just repetitive verses and boasts poorly anchored by weightless, mealy-mouthed hooks. One example is the penultimate track “John Lennon,” which initially matches the intensity offered by opening track “Never Win,” but ends up lumbering along instead of taking off, offering a cumbersome bridge and no thematic resolution. </p>
<p>Intentionally or not, too much of the tape sounds unimaginatively inspired by TDE. Issa Gold frequently lapses to a hard syllable, ratatat flow that's pure <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30134-schoolboy-q/"">Schoolboy Q</a>, while AK's gruff bark brings<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30639-jay-rock/""> Jay Rock</a> to mind, but you wish either could match <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30353-ab-soul/"">Ab-Soul</a>'s pathos. There are nearly no memorable lines (although “I’m like LeBron/I’m like Mussolini, Genghis Khan/a leader of the town” got stuck in my mind for all the wrong reasons) or impressionable beats. Even on “Gangland,” where Issa Gold raps, “I blow weed til I collapse, every night I say I quit/but every morning I relapse,” the line doesn’t land because there’s no emotional context to place it into, no weighty dynamic that redeems all the flat “smokin’ Cali shit” talk with something that grapples with morality a little more meaningfully outside this one passive moment.</p>
<p>Contrast all this with the Technicolor fun of a group like the Bay Area’s Heartbreak Gang, New York's genuinely weird Doppelgangaz, or Tacoma's obscure but rewarding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33064-illfightyou/"">ILLFIGHTYOU</a>, whose debut 2013 mixtape picked up similar buzz. <i>It Happened in Flatbush</i> lacks a compelling reason to listen, especially if their vaguely intriguing mystical conscious brand is what got you into them in the first place. It's a concentrated dose of rappity-rap New York stuff—fine if your patience for it runs high, but if not, likely to make you tune out.</p></div>"|21940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21940-it-happened-in-flatbush/|5.3|Matthew Ramirez

But in a somewhat more liberated world, Omnivore's </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last Word on First Blues </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">box set makes more sense now than any time since the double LP's 1983 release on John Hammond's eponymous indie label. A radical in Ronald Reagan's ‘80s as much in Dwight Eisenhower's ‘50s, Allen Ginsberg's open, gleeful, and articulate queerness bursts through here as clear as ever, a poet dancing with all the legal freedoms earned when a California State Superior Judge declared that Ginsberg's groundbreaking 1956 poem “Howl” was of “redeeming social importance,” and therefore not obscene—freedoms Ginsberg had declared himself to possess long before. While the poet's wobbling voice remains a hard sell in the 21st century (ditto, to some listeners, his sexploits), producer Pat Thomas' loving </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last Word on</span></i> <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First Blues </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">reissue reveals Ginsberg as a missing link in the East Village's musical pathways, a secret alt-folk hero hidden in relatively plain view.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Recorded over three sessions in 1971, 1976, and 1981, the new </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First Blues </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">comes with a third disc of supplementary material, including appearances by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> on bass and jazz hero <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18454-don-cherry/"">Don Cherry </a>on kazoo. It opens with the Dylan-abetted sing-alongs “Going to San Diego” and “Vomit Express,” both sounding as if Ginsberg had visited Big Pink for a session in the Basement. Amid the surreal-hootenanny atmosphere, in which Dylan jams alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a>, Ginsberg's voice finds a comfort zone. But, just as much as Dylan, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First Blues</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> carries forward the sloppy and joyous folk-rock of Ginsberg's East Village neighbors in the Holy Modal Rounders and the over-the-top poetry of his friends in The Fugs, whose co-founder Ed Sanders appears in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last Word </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">session photos from 1971. At the heart of the later recordings, too, is Steven Taylor, Ginsberg's long-term musical partner, who fixes the poet's anarchic spirit and wandering melodic tendencies amid a solid folk-rock sparkle—and who would go on to join the The Fugs when that band reunited in 1984. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Though released as one album, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First Blues </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">also represents three separate slices of Ginsberg's musical career: sex-positive folk romps like “Jimmy Berman (Gay Lib Rag),” word-crammed investigative poetry anthems like “CIA Dope Calypso,” and less classifiable specimens of wise cosmic folk. The lines are blurry, but it is the latter category that is perhaps the most refreshing. Though Ginsberg isn't a singer by most traditional measures, he is a surprising and capable songwriter, finding charming melodies he can only get across in the broadest way, as on “Vomit Express” (from 1971), aided by big gang vocals on the chorus, and the Rounders-like “Old Pond” (from ten years later). </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For all his legendary lack of inhibition, Ginsberg's singing is sometimes a bit (</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ahem</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) stiff, more a crooning poet than a singer-songwriter. The 1976 band is the most supportive, featuring David Mansfield on elegant pedal steel and Arthur Russell on cello, achieving an easy, swaying grace on “Gospel Novel Truths” and a cool existential swing on “Broken Bone Blues.” These songs and others seem primed for covering by a new generation of free weirdos, including the rambunctious “Guru Blues” (“I can't find anyone to fuck me in the ass”), the solemn “Father Death Blues.” It is on the demos disc, too, that the bed bugs and speed freaks of “NY Blues” provide a through-line to the hyper-local topicality of contemporary East Side songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14772-jeffrey-lewis/"">Jeffrey Lewis</a>, fitting in comfortably next to “Scowling Crackhead Ian” and other characters of Lewis' recent </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Manhattan</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perhaps a more natural and capable freak-folker is Ginsberg's hubby, the poet Peter Orlovsky, who punctuates his ode “You Are My Dildo” with a game jug-band falsetto, and (on the bonus disc) delivers his fellatio-lovin’ “Penny's Farm” rewrite “Feeding Them Raspberries To Grow” in a convincingly olde-tyme warble. At their best, the players in the three different session bands featured here make a spot for Ginsberg and his voice to become one with the music, as on the 1976 outtake “Slack Key Guitar,” an anti-colonial nu-exotica lullaby that recalls a more chilled-out Van Dyke Parks.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For its numerous charms, Ginsberg's sexual openness continues to make </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First Blues </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">an eyebrow-raising experience three-and-a-half decades after its recording. Nor is it without its complications. “Everybody's just a little bit homosexual whether they like it or not,” Ginsberg sings on the first line of the provocative and Fug-ly “Everybody Sing,” but “everybody” in the song's cosmology doesn't seem to include females. (Orlovsky is a bit more equal-opportunity.) As in his visionary poetry, all of Allen Ginsberg is on display during the the two-and-a-half hours of recordings, intentional and not, but always (and still) vital. As responsible for pop music's turn to poetry as anyone, Allen Ginsberg had more than a few songs of his own.</span></p></div>"|21933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21933-the-last-word-on-first-blues/|7.9|Jesse Jarnow

Translations for the word range from smart to brave to courageous to talented to witty. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30509-debo-band/"">Debo Band</a>’s saxophonist, leader and ethnomusicologist Danny Mekonnen translates the phrase “</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ere gobez</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">” as a “call of the lionhearted—it's a term used to inspire.” It’s certainly an apt label and message for the Ethiopian 11-piece band’s second album, a record the reaches and then surpasses the heights of their excellent 2012 self-titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16847-debo-band/"">debut</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Because not only do the varying definitions of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">gobez </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fit the range of music on this record, but the music of Debo Band is that of a big, brave roar, song after song. This is a powerful, and, perhaps, inspirational record: it certainly inspires </span>dancing<b>, </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">filling spaces and capturing a dynamic live sensibility.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s no surprise that this is a band that takes up a great deal of room. With so many members, some in Boston, some as far away as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24845-addis-ababa/"">Addis Ababa</a> (violinist Kaethe Hostetter established a String Center in the Ethiopian capital), Debo is true to its name, which means “communal labor.” The community of Debo Band includes a bold, shimmery horn section, complete with sousaphone, but also slick guitar, a tight rhythm section, orchestral strings, an accordion and, on occasion, a masinquo—a one-stringed Ethiopian fiddle. There’s a quaver in lead vocalist Bruck Tesfaye’s voice that is in keeping with Amharic-language singing style, but it is a powerfully pure energy that sits on top of each song, rising  along with all the other instruments.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you know anything about Ethiopian music and musical traditions, it’s most likely that you have a good relationship with the over two-dozen edition strong <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10747-the-very-best-of-ethiopiques-hypnotic-grooves-from-the-legendary-series/"">Éthiopiques</a></i><i> </i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">series, lovingly curated by France’s Francis Falceto. The series focuses on the 1960s and ‘70s, and Debo Band certainly draws from this era, but they also pull from more recent times as well as from funk, rock and pop. Debo’s material is reinterpreted and reconsidered, pushed through a creative process that remains true to source as well as their own specific sound (7 of the 11 tracks on the album draw from previously existing works, which are well cited in the liner notes).  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is an adaptation of Somali Dur-Dur band song “Rafaad iyo Raaxo” (originally performed in the mid-'80s) on “Kehulum Abliche” and Debo Band dips into Okinawa, Japan in “Hiyamikachi Bushi” (a song composed almost 60 years ago). </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ere Gobez</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> provides numerous examples how Debo Band seems to taking part in conversations that are happening in multiple spaces and places at different times. Heck, “Yalanchi” sounds almost like a smooth groove that might, just might, be in good company with some Yacht Rock luminaries.</span></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, it’s valuable to note that the specific rhythms of songs such as “Oromo” and “Ele” draw upon the musical cultures of the Oromo and Gurage<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The infectious spring of these two tracks is undeniable. It’s near impossible not to dance to, even if you aren’t familiar with the exact dance styles necessary, though it’s certainly fun to take a little YouTube trip to find out the level of skill and control involved in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWak8PO3ySU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oromo</a> as well as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g9zrAkOC3o%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gurage</a> dancing. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By doing so, one can understand just how important the big sound and speed of the songs function for dancing. And it’s hard to imagine any of the band members standing still during the recording of this record. Or anyone who will listen to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ere Gobez </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">or see Debo Band live either. Each track seems to bounce around the room, pulling the listener along with it.</span></p></div>"|21949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21949-ere-gobez/|8.1|Erin MacLeod

Hell, even the release strategy of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">EP 4 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is similar to the one used by the stars: the short-lead, quick drop of highly-anticipated material.</span></p>

This likely worked in favor of Wolf Parade, since </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">EP 4 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feels ancillary to their return rather than the focus. This isn’t the sound of Wolf Parade asserting themselves. It’s Wolf Parade reintroducing themselves to <i>each other</i> after Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner built massive catalogs that now makes their original band a supergroup in reverse. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wolf Parade had originally <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/64782-wolf-parade-tease-new-release-listen/"">promised something</a> with a “heavy glam vibe,” </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">suggested Krug was taking the spiritual lead here—in all aspects, vocally, sartorially, lyrically, he’s the theatre kid in Wolf Parade and, moreover, his songs are the ones that work best with crowd participation. Turns out those reference points were simply meant to signify a leaner, more trebly and immediate version of Wolf Parade, scaling back on the thick, proggy arrangements that defined the lesser-loved <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11616-at-mount-zoomer/"">At Mount Zoomer</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14398-expo-86/"">Expo 86</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s much easier for Krug to find his “Wolf Parade mode”: he simply has to be more reined in than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4126-sunset-rubdown/"">Sunset Rubdown</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28467-moonface/"">Moonface</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5021-swan-lake/"">Swan Lake</a>, which means writing songs that are about three minutes instead of six—“Mr. Startup” and “C’est La Vie Way” are satisfying, jittery New Wave that could’ve just as easily been attributed to Boeckner. The streamlined, aerodynamic sound of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">EP 4 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">has much more in common with Boeckner' work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32434-operators/"">Operators</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5280-handsome-furs/"">Handsome Furs</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30530-divine-fits/"">Divine Fits</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Enjoyable as it is, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">EP 4 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">does seem like smart risk management, a test run that confirms that whatever the group comes up with won’t be a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a>-style <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18875-pixies-ep-2/"">disaster</a>.  As such, the rewards are modest: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Floating World”</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">pleasantly hovers, never aspiring to the moon launch of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLGs2H3gDJw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Yulia.”</a> The frenzied midsection of “C’est La Vie Way” recalls “Fancy Claps”, but only briefly before pulling back. The most instantly lovable parts are the “2005!” sonic easter eggs: the second verse of “Mr. Startup” works the hi-hat on the 2 and 4, which defined the sound of mid-2k indie rock almost as much as the word “angular.”</span></span></p>

From the mid/late-‘00s onward, there was a feverish proliferation of digitized vinyl on mp3-sharing blogs, many of which featured music from West Africa. One of those blogs was the popular Comb and Razor, run by Uchenna Ikonne, who’s since become the main man behind a number of Nigeria-focused projects for labels like Soundway, Luaka Bop, and Now-Again. Since the early 2010s, what some have called the “Scramble for African Vinyl” has slowed down a bit, if in part because various collectors have rendered certain vinyl-rich areas comparatively “dry.” So it says something about Now-Again that they took the better part of a decade to properly license, credit, and release what is now <i>Wake Up You!: The Rise and Fall of Nigerian Rock, 1972-1977</i>.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Where other Nigerian vinyl compilations have focused on various permutations of rock, funk, soul, and disco, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wake Up You!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> specifically covers the short-lived but influential period of Nigerian rock in the country’s post-Civil War era (after 1970). On 34 tracks across two volumes and two accompanying books, the compilation documents some of the musical, socioeconomic, and political trends that shaped Nigerian Afrorock. </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The majority of both </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feature music from the height of Nigerian rock in the early ‘70s, before the scene started to decline. The decade saw Nigeria experiencing a petroleum-fueled post-war economic boom, which ushered in a renewed sense of optimism that proved a huge boon to the growth of the country’s music industry. And yet, as the government sought to rebuild the nation, leftover wartime trauma and unresolved tensions got swept under the rug. So it's very possible that the sense of discomfort and melancholy that had never really gotten addressed then ended up bubbling over into rock, particularly in the East, which had borne the brunt of the war as the former secessionist Republic of Biafra. The compilation reflects that reality, featuring mostly Eastern rock bands. </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite regional differences, there was a collective desire, especially among youth, to have some kind of contemporary music they could claim as their own that was “distinctly African."" This was one of the reasons why <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a>’s soul music, with its pro-Black messaging and funky rhythms that meshed well with pre-existing West African musical traditions, had exploded in popularity during the region’s independence era. His influence continued into the next decade and beyond, as evidenced throughout </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wake Up You!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> For instance, on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Hygrades’ 1971 B-side “Keep on Moving"" directly references ""Cold Sweat"" and has the cathartic screams to match.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This desire for a homegrown music was also what helped make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"">Fela</a>’s self-branded Afrobeat so popular, which would soon eclipse Afrorock, even though the two weren’t initially that different. The stylistic similarities between the two are clear in their shared highlife percussion rhythms and off-kilter organ work. This can be heard across </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">—on The Hygrades’ “In the Jungle (Instrumental),” The Funkees’ “Baby I Need You,” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11035-ofo-the-black-company/"">OFO the Black Company</a>’s “Beautiful Daddy,” and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> opener “Never Never Let Me Down” (1973), the little-known Formulars Dance Band deliver a touching number filled with nostalgic doo-wop harmonies and lyrics steeped in heartache: “Just one thing you do not know, girl,” the lead singer croons. “And that is I need you/And one more thing you do not know, girl/And that is I love you.” By contrast, War-Head Constriction’s record ""Graceful Bird"" (1973) ramps up into a heavy metal track with long, snarling guitar solos and piles of distortion. According to Ikonne’s liner notes, War-Head Constriction also often played with a later iteration of the band Waves, whose psychedelic “Wake Up You” (featured on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) b/w “Mother” (on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) is the comp’s namesake. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s closing track, P.R.O.’s 1976 “Tell Me,” in turn references dub by way of delay effects, hinting at the fact that towards the end of the decade, a several schoolboy and college rock bands—including teen sensations Ofege—started shifting their heavy rock sound towards ""dub and militant rockers-style reggae."" But even then, with the exception of Afrobeat and with the advent of disco, the public wanted something smoother and glossier, and Nigerian rock slipped more or less into darkness (related: Funkees’ cover of War’s “Slipping into Darkness” on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In that way, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> comes to a logical close.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Much of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> expresses a desire for freedom and a resistance to the social and political dis-ease of post-war Nigeria. On “Life in Cannan,” Ceejebs lament the state of what could have been their promised land. Over nimble jazz keys and thick bass, lead vocalist Eyo “Crosbee” Hogan gathers his listeners around him, intoning, “Come around, people of this world/let’s get together and pray/Evil things are happening every day/Many rich are getting poor/The poor ones are dying away.” Echoing that sense of despair is The Identicals’ nearly-apocalyptic “Who Made the World,” on which they demand answers to questions they know they’ll never get, howling, “Who made the world? Who made the land? Who made the moon?” Even the love songs here ride on a sort of desperation bordering on futility: on opening number “Come Back,” band leader Theodore Nemy’s voice cracks time and time again as he begs for his “baby” to “come back.” An organ drones beneath him, sympathetic (figuratively and musically) to Nemy’s grievances.</span> </p>

Many brigades of the time used bands to entertain their soldiers, boost morale, and reassure citizens, via music, that all was well. Initially, their patronage was helpful in providing a number of Eastern musicians with a living. But Action 13, like many other bands with brigade numbers affixed to their names, eventually grew frustrated, and many tried to break free to make a name for themselves independent of the military. These outside pressures, as well as labels’ jostling to sign artists with varying degrees of success, often augmented bands’ internal instabilities as well. There was a ton of back-and-forth between bands. For instance, on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, we see Tony Grey, (former?) keyboardist of the Magnificent Zenians (</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) leading his own band, The Black 7; certain members of Afrorock pioneer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11020-joni-haastrup/"">Joni Haastrup</a>’s Monomono appear here backing one Shadow Abraham; juju icon King Sunny Ade makes a surprise appearance producing The Believers’ “Life Will Move.” Trying to make sense of the bands’ relationships to each other, to regional trends, to labels, and to military involvement is like trying to make sense of a messy maze of crossed paths, dead-ends, and false starts.</span></p>

From the mid/late-‘00s onward, there was a feverish proliferation of digitized vinyl on mp3-sharing blogs, many of which featured music from West Africa. One of those blogs was the popular Comb and Razor, run by Uchenna Ikonne, who’s since become the main man behind a number of Nigeria-focused projects for labels like Soundway, Luaka Bop, and Now-Again. Since the early 2010s, what some have called the “Scramble for African Vinyl” has slowed down a bit, if in part because various collectors have rendered certain vinyl-rich areas comparatively “dry.” So it says something about Now-Again that they took the better part of a decade to properly license, credit, and release what is now <i>Wake Up You!: The Rise and Fall of Nigerian Rock, 1972-1977</i>.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Where other Nigerian vinyl compilations have focused on various permutations of rock, funk, soul, and disco, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wake Up You!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> specifically covers the short-lived but influential period of Nigerian rock in the country’s post-Civil War era (after 1970). On 34 tracks across two volumes and two accompanying books, the compilation documents some of the musical, socioeconomic, and political trends that shaped Nigerian Afrorock. </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The majority of both </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feature music from the height of Nigerian rock in the early ‘70s, before the scene started to decline. The decade saw Nigeria experiencing a petroleum-fueled post-war economic boom, which ushered in a renewed sense of optimism that proved a huge boon to the growth of the country’s music industry. And yet, as the government sought to rebuild the nation, leftover wartime trauma and unresolved tensions got swept under the rug. So it's very possible that the sense of discomfort and melancholy that had never really gotten addressed then ended up bubbling over into rock, particularly in the East, which had borne the brunt of the war as the former secessionist Republic of Biafra. The compilation reflects that reality, featuring mostly Eastern rock bands. </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite regional differences, there was a collective desire, especially among youth, to have some kind of contemporary music they could claim as their own that was “distinctly African."" This was one of the reasons why <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a>’s soul music, with its pro-Black messaging and funky rhythms that meshed well with pre-existing West African musical traditions, had exploded in popularity during the region’s independence era. His influence continued into the next decade and beyond, as evidenced throughout </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wake Up You!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> For instance, on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Hygrades’ 1971 B-side “Keep on Moving"" directly references ""Cold Sweat"" and has the cathartic screams to match.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This desire for a homegrown music was also what helped make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"">Fela</a>’s self-branded Afrobeat so popular, which would soon eclipse Afrorock, even though the two weren’t initially that different. The stylistic similarities between the two are clear in their shared highlife percussion rhythms and off-kilter organ work. This can be heard across </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">—on The Hygrades’ “In the Jungle (Instrumental),” The Funkees’ “Baby I Need You,” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11035-ofo-the-black-company/"">OFO the Black Company</a>’s “Beautiful Daddy,” and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> opener “Never Never Let Me Down” (1973), the little-known Formulars Dance Band deliver a touching number filled with nostalgic doo-wop harmonies and lyrics steeped in heartache: “Just one thing you do not know, girl,” the lead singer croons. “And that is I need you/And one more thing you do not know, girl/And that is I love you.” By contrast, War-Head Constriction’s record ""Graceful Bird"" (1973) ramps up into a heavy metal track with long, snarling guitar solos and piles of distortion. According to Ikonne’s liner notes, War-Head Constriction also often played with a later iteration of the band Waves, whose psychedelic “Wake Up You” (featured on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) b/w “Mother” (on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) is the comp’s namesake. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 1</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s closing track, P.R.O.’s 1976 “Tell Me,” in turn references dub by way of delay effects, hinting at the fact that towards the end of the decade, a several schoolboy and college rock bands—including teen sensations Ofege—started shifting their heavy rock sound towards ""dub and militant rockers-style reggae."" But even then, with the exception of Afrobeat and with the advent of disco, the public wanted something smoother and glossier, and Nigerian rock slipped more or less into darkness (related: Funkees’ cover of War’s “Slipping into Darkness” on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vol. 2</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">).</span></p>

In interviews describing their 2014 debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19555-adult-jazz-gist-is/"">Gist Is</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, they name dropped Hermann Hesse, criticized religious institutions, and said that the album tackled everything from morality to empathy and the efficacy of communication itself. NPR even followed suit when reviewing the record, saying it was concerned with “the search for meaning in life.” Two years later they’ve released their sophomore follow-up, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Earrings Off! </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a record that equally embraces the same theory-laden attitude. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Earrings Off! </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is meant to analyze the complexities of gender and the body’s changing place in society. In descriptions of the album, the band has stressed the record’s interest in “the possibility of authenticity” in a society that rewards normative behavior. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s all very interesting to read about what an album is <i>supposed</i> to do, and there is precedent for the political thrust of a piece of music to affect the conversation it’s entering, but these intentions can so often backfire. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21698-the-hope-six-demolition-project/"">The Hope Six Demolition Project </a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">being a case study for this fine line). The</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> cleverness and unique playfulness of Adult Jazz's debut <i>Gist Is</i> helped steer it away from the cliff of self-indulgence and pretension. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Earrings Off! </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">edges</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> much closer to that drop-off than its predecessor, burdened by often-silly lyrics and a sound that is a bit more derivative than their last record would suggest.  </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What still remains uniquely rewarding about Adult Jazz’s music is the construction of their sound. They use a trombone, cello, processed vocals, and a menagerie of sample to tread the line between acidic minimalism and bubbly exuberance in confoundingly expert ways. Of this album’s seven songs, three of them (“(Cry for Time Off,)” “(Cry for Coherence),” and “(Cry for Home)”) are short sonic sketches, serving as the most interesting moments in the otherwise slow pace of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Earrings Off!’s </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">24 minutes. These three songs mostly focus on single sounds—a helium-cracked vocal cry, dissonant string loops, and the bated breath of a brass instrument. These pared-down constructions generate more and more detail on repeated listens. The album’s four other songs attempt to mimic this but come off as overwrought and heavy handed at best. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The difficult six minutes of “Pumped From Above” exploits corrosive horn sounds and maddeningly uneven drumming for all their worth. It could almost sound like a facsimile of a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY7pmwO-1hc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter Brötzman</a> composition, but the arrangement of the chaotic noises can be curiously predictable. The singing is usually so swaddled by the noises that Harry Burgess’ words are obscured, but when you look at what he’s saying on paper it can make the experience even more cringe-inducing. Take this passage: “God cannot be softening/He beats strong with iron wings/Kneeling sporty chest pumping/Before the Alpha-lord.” You can open up any book of poems by Hart Crane or Dylan Thomas and find a similar impenetrability. But these words and images have the feeling of being selected at random; their difficulty doesn't have a sense of clarity or deeper meaning and incomprehensibility isn't the same as seriousness.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> This is a running thread through the album that detracts from where </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Earrings Off!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> improves upon their debut. They’ve learned how to create hooks without sacrificing from their outre sounds. This is best accomplished in the title track (which pleasantly confirms any of the Dirty Projectors comparisons) and “Eggshell.” But even the pleasure of craft can melt away when you figure out amidst the textures these words are ringing out: “And if he's 1940's/He whistles through a meadow.” It makes it impossible for the album to actually engage with the conversation it proposes, and often made me wish I could ignore the words and allow the singing to be another instrument. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Earrings Off! </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is filled with these sorts of growing pains, ones that hopefully point to brighter pastures sometime soon for this promising band.  </span></p></div>"|21936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21936-earrings-off/|6.0|Kevin Lozano

In that crowd, Grande didn't really seem like the bad girl; maybe she knew one she could fix you up with? As she told <i><a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2013/11/ariana-grande-interview-shadow-of-a-doubt-2013-cover-story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Complex</a></i> the year before,“I don’t see myself as sexy and I’m not comfortable being sexy and dressing sexy. I don’t see myself ever becoming a sex symbol.” But she seems to have taken the “Bang Bang” lyric as a mood-board inspiration for her third album <i>Dangerous Woman, </i>which finds the 22-year-old trading in the mini-skirts, go-go boots, and cat ears for a Sasha Fierce-like alter ego. As a result, Grande spends most of <i>Dangerous Woman</i> coyly flirting with desire, “bad decisions,” and independence. “Something about you makes me feel like a dangerous woman,” she sings on the chorus to the slow-burning title track, which is a few qualifications away from actual danger. There's something about the whole album that feels a bit like Sandy in her skintight leather outfit at the end of <i>Grease</i>, only in Ari’s case, it’s a latex bunny mask.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At this point, there’s no question that Grande is a powerhouse vocalist, having earned her comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6580-celine-dion/"">Celine Dion</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10697-mariah-carey/""> Mariah Carey</a>, and Christina Aguilera circa </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Back to Basics. (</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">mong her spot-on impersonations of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7uBph38kXo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">those singers</a>, Grande does an absolutely <i>insane</i> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss9ygQqqL2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aguilera impression</a>, solidifying her spot as the diva’s millennial incarnation.) Grande’s four-octave range, impeccable control, and penchant for belting assures that no matter the lyrics or production, her music will always be strong in that regard. And as in her previous album<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19765-ariana-grande-my-everything/""> <i>My Everything</i></a>, which was chock-full of bangers like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32956-zedd/"">Zedd</a>-produced “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16977-ariana-grande-break-free-ft-zedd/"">Break Free</a>,” the production on her new </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dangerous Woman</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is enormous, full of flirty pop eruptions and slinky dancefloor seductions. ""Into You,"" produced and co-written by Max Martin and Alexander Kronlund, who helped pen some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"">Robyn</a>’s best songs, might be Grande's best single since “Love Me Harder.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So then where does </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dangerous Woman</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> struggle? In a rather forthcoming</span> <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7377472/ariana-grande-billboard-cover-story-dangerous-woman-avoiding-drama-feminism"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Billboard</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Grande described the album as “a 22-year-old girl comes into her own trying to balance growing up, love, and a lot of other bullshit along the way.” However, the listener comes away from </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dangerous Woman</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> feeling like they still don’t know much about the ponytailed lady peeping out from behind the mask. Grande has never touted herself as a</span> <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7377472/ariana-grande-billboard-cover-story-dangerous-woman-avoiding-drama-feminism"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swiftian</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> friend to all fans, but her slight reserve means that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dangerous Woman</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, paradoxically, feels safe, which acts in contradiction to the at least 19 times she sings a variation of “danger” or “dangerous” on the record.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dangerous Woman </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">opens with “Moonlight,” which was originally the title of the record and thusly should perhaps be viewed as a prologue. “Moonlight” offers the album’s closest thing to a ballad, all celestial romance and melismas. But it’s serenity is quickly steamrolled over by “Dangerous Woman,” the real introduction to the record. “Dangerous Woman” is a slinky, empowered, Bond theme of a belter; you can practically picture her sauntering down a grand staircase in a floor-length gown and fur on the way to seduce and destroy a lover. After the quake of “Dangerous Woman,” “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18116-ariana-grande-be-alright/"">Be Alright</a>” and “Into You” are appropriately both cool, snappy little thumpers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the middle of this 15-track record, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dangerous Woman</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s guest features feel underused and lackluster. Nicki Minaj’s verse on “Side to Side” is a far cry from the duo’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20058-the-pinkprint/"">Pinkprint</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> collaboration “Get on Your Knees” which found both women returning to the personalities of “Bang Bang,” Ariana as a doe-eyed vixen, Nicki as the tough-as-nails Queen. That chemistry is absent here and instead Minaj’s bored, reggae-tinged verse compliments neither women. Although Minaj once again relies on the sexual wordplay her last name provides, the verse feels rather PG. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a>’s appearance on “Let Me Love You” was one of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dangerous Woman</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s more surprising features, yet perhaps predictably, Weezy seems sleepy. He manages to throw out the cringe-worthy line “She grinding on this Grande, oh lord,” and not even the obligatory “moolah baby!” saves him from sounding half-hearted. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perhaps the most unsatisfying collaborator is Future. A majority of his contribution is repeating the song’s title, “Everyday,” making him </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dangerous Woman</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s more minimalist version of Big Sean on “Problem.” If Future’s sexual-devotion-filled verse was taken away, it would be immediately obvious that “Everyday” is constructed atop a pile of hot fluff. The only exception to this is Macy Gray’s “Leave Me Lonely,” which sets Gray’s raspy pipes against Grande’s flawless vocals, adding a welcome change of consistency. Smack in the middle of all these features is “Greedy,” a romp that announces that Grande truly shines when she is given center stage.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second half of the record lacks the energy of the first. She continues to sing of growth and maturity from a former self (“I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be but if I can’t be me then fucks the point?”) with the point being that she is now free in thought and action. A</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">s Minaj says on “Side to Side,” “young Ariana run pop.” This is indeed evident on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dangerous Woman</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, even if the results are uneven at times. Grande does not need to force any sort of spirit, she is full of it already. She just needs to find the Dangerous Woman within herself and let her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8eRzOYhLuw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">break free</a>. </span></p></div>"|21892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21892-dangerous-woman/|7.6|Quinn Moreland

So far the documentary hasn’t been made, but the impressions of the trips during the fall and spring of 2014 led to his first album in three years, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Good Luck and Do Your Best.</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Apparently the moment of inspiration and the album’s title came from a chance interaction with a taxi driver who wished them luck, saying those very words as they exited the cab. He wrote the album in Chelmsford, using Laura's photos, their colors and experiences, as catalysts for the album’s 11 tracks.</span></p>
<p> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is decidedly brighter, more low-key, and less dance-oriented than his previous outing <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18121-gold-panda-half-of-where-you-live/"">Half of Where You Live</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead this newest album seems to fit more into the structure and mood of his debut </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14732-lucky-shiner/"">Lucky Shiner</a>. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The same spirit of nostalgia, pleasantly handmade feel (which comes from his expert use of MPCs), and wistful joy pervades </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Good Luck and Do Your Best. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It sounds quite unlike any of the electronic music being made in 2016, and is refreshingly unfashionable in that way.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best tracks capture the short-lived exuberance of the photographer's golden hour. When the sun is on the cusp of setting, if you’re lucky, streetscapes will be awash in an exceedingly warm golden light. It makes whatever you photograph seem more buoyant, colorful, and evanescent. The bright drum-pad meditation of “In My Car” and the understated string arrangements in “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18065-gold-panda-time-eater/"">Time Eater</a>” all speak to this kind of feeling. Gold Panda is at his best making lush and ambulatory compositions, and the relaxed itinerancy of a vacation is most evident in his more minimal sound studies, like “Unthank” and “I Am Real Punk” which rely on just a few elements, like the repetition of plucked strings or a single synth looped. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Those songs in particular reminded me of the producer Suzanne Craft, or the compositions by the Japanese vibraphonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33108-masayoshi-fujita/"">Masayoshi Fujita</a>. They have same ability to create a grand feeling atmosphere out of minimal ingredients. This album only doesn’t work when it gestures towards faster paces. “Song for a Dead Friend” stands out as a one of the album’s true missteps, a seemingly juke-inspired track that twists an ankle and falls flat. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In terms of samples used, the Japanese inspiration seemed to come mostly from the use of string instruments, but otherwise it’s more muted than the story suggests. Two music videos were released in advance of the album (for “Pink &amp; Green” and “Time Eater”) and the videos try to give an idea of what the documentary might have been. In “Pink &amp; Green” in particular we find Gold Panda and Laura in the midst of the vacation. They walk the streets, gaze at the sights, eat at McDonalds. They take the train and laugh at dinner and sing karaoke, as tourists must feel compelled to do in Japan. There’s a kernel in the visual aesthetic and silent narrative that might not mean to point to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lost in Translation</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, but it’s hard to avoid. How can you appreciate a vacation in a foreign place, thoughtfully and gracefully? Missteps seem inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Listening to this album, I wondered if Gold Panda set out to explore some of these thoughts from the pads of an MPC. Does archiving a vacation in sounds or pictures, making art of it, do justice to the essential passing of things? Is nostalgia destructive or generative? At the end of it all, the music escapes the expectations its creators imbue it with. As its title suggests </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Good Luck and Do Your Best is</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> a modest and heartfelt attempt to celebrate a memory and place that you continue to love even at a distance. </span></p></div>"|21874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21874-good-luck-and-do-your-best/|7.4|Kevin Lozano

It doesn’t murmur or churn; it s<i>quawks</i>, sort of, digging into your nerves like a hangnail: “Stop, stop, I confess,” someone reportedly wailed at the work’s premiere. A concertgoer rapped her shoe on the stage at the same performance, like Khrushchev at the 1960 United Nations General Assembly. Reich described the scene years later with evident pleasure as a “riot.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>As a result, it acquired a reputation in Steve Reich’s canon. It is unloved, the black-sheep son that will never reap the adulation of <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i> or <i>Different Trains</i>. But the thing is, Reich <i>designed</i> it for discomfort. The whole piece consists of four Farfisa organs, hardly peaceful instruments, leaning on one long dominant eleventh chord. This chord, the dominant eleventh, is a “home” chord with bits and notes of other places lingering in it. It is inherently uneasy, rooted to the spot with one eye over its shoulder. Even if you’ve never looked at a page of written music in your life, you can just <i>feel </i>the tendons pulling in its harmonic makeup. Listening to this piece in headphones, with multiple Farfisas pulling at this one chord like dogs fighting over a sock, I sometimes had to remind myself to unclench my jaw.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This record, reissued by the San Francisco-based label Superior Viaduct, was originally released in 1970 by Shandar, a small French label that made an outsized impact on American musical modernism: in its decade-long existence, the imprint managed to release works by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/184-albert-ayler/"">Albert Ayler</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5844-lamonte-young/"">La Monte Young</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11694-cecil-taylor/"">Cecil Taylor</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"">Sun Ra</a>, and many others. Like any good champions of the musical avant-garde, they were eventually punished by fate: in 1979, a flood destroyed most of their original vinyl stock, effectively ending the enterprise.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But for a while, places like Shandar were safe harbor for then-misfits like Reich. The two pieces here, <i>Four Organs</i> and <i>Phase Patterns</i>, come from an era of Reich’s work when he was still in an obsessively scientific mode, boring down on a single capital-I Idea to extract from it whatever secrets might be unlocked from it. The idea here was his first big one, and the one that he remains most associated with: If you took two tones, set them apart from each other, and then moved them in and out of frequency incrementally, you could push open a gate of perception. The idea began with tape loops, but Reich soon moved it into live instrumentation, and then pushed its way into larger forces, where that original idea could be heard more as a whisper more than a shriek. Here, it is the work of four monomaniacally focused musicians: The Farfisas are played by Steve Reich and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>, joined by Arthur “Art” Bixler Murphy and Steve Chambers, while Jon Gibson supplies the steady maraca shakes. </div>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>These early works have a fierceness, a pointed urgency to them, the way that early works in new styles tend to: They are not only establishing a new language but also arguing for their very right to exist in the same breath. “Phase Patterns,” the second composition on this recording, has a similar feel: To layman ears, it might sound like the beginning of a long <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14472-ray-manzarek/"">Ray Manzarek</a> organ solo that caught a snag in a tree branch mid-ascent. It also might sound, to digital-age music fans, like an intentionally corrupted recording, something that had been spliced on a laptop. But that’s where the dizzy energy of these recordings come from: Behind these odd, irregular shapes are four musicians counting measures and beats as if their lives depended on it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>All of this makes the piece sound like torture, which of course it is not — it is a sensory challenge, the same way a deep massage can be. When the masseuse leans their elbow into the soft tissue under your shoulder blade, you groan but you don’t yelp; you trust that when they are done you will feel the benefits of the discomfort. So it is with your ears and mind and <i>Four Organs</i>. It is good to have your patience stretched, your senses tugged. Minimalism was often thought of as smooth churn, something to help regulate your breathing and help you zone out. But that’s only one function it serves; it can also tunnel deep into areas of your nervous system that other music doesn’t even think to aim for. </div></div>"|21584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21584-four-organs-phase-patterns/|7.6|Jayson Greene

Nearly of all the classic emo bands either spectacularly implode in their early stages, devolve into sustainable mediocrity or are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7032-fall-out-boy/"">Fall Out Boy</a>. But after launching some of the leading figures of emo’s 4th wave, Topshelf Records has served as a continuing ed lab for elder statesmen: in 2014, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/450-braid/"">Braid</a> sounded as contemporary and vital as ever on their Will Yip-produced <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19502-braid-no-coast/"">No Coast</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and also shed some light on the oft-overlooked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/387-never-will-come-for-us-the-unexpected-return-of-braid-and-the-jazz-june/"">Jazz June</a> when they released </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After the Earthquake </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">months later. With their </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ninth </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">release</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and first in five years, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33703-mock-orange/"">Mock Orange</a> is in the same place <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4468-the-velvet-teen/"">the Velvet Teen</a> were on their 2015 Topshelf comeback <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20761-all-is-illusory/"">All is Illusory</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: previously unclassifiable to their detriment, they’re now given a new, flattering context in which to be understood. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Looking at it now, Mock Orange’s convoluted trajectory could actually serve as the basis for a tragicomic mockumentary of late-'90s emo. Their first two LPs were produced by Mark Trombino and J. Robbins and released on a label that was destroyed by George Lucas in a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Dead-Droid-Records-106964459413045/info?tab=page_info"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">copyright infringement suit</a>. After the turn of the century, they evolved into a kind of floral, orchestrated indie rock that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te4Wof1zGVk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Get Up Kids</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr6UFkUSfxI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Promise Ring</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smMQv_Kxcqs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saves the Day</a> used to effectively end their commercial peaks. 2004’s sync-friendly </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mind is Not Brain </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">somehow found them within reach of MTV2 airplay and major cable shows and fittingly, they toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3643-rogue-wave/"">Rogue Wave</a>, that era’s definitive “shit luck” band. On their next two albums, they dabbled in literate, NPR-indie and more or less went alt-country. And now, here’s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Put the Kid on the Sleepy Horse,</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> which was put in jeopardy after a nearly fatal hard drive failure. Seriously, always back things up, kids.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After all that, it’s natural that Mock Orange would spend </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Put the Kid </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">trying to assess whether the bullshit has been worth it. Single “High Octane Punk Mode” probably would’ve been sarcastic even in their early days, but the lightly chiding tone fits within what is otherwise midtempo, “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The O.C.” </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">indie mode. Ryan Grisham relates how his desire to expand his social circle and listening habits even the slightest bit are still seen as betrayals in his community, reflecting on the blinkered view within hardcore that only becomes apparent once you step outside of it: “the safety pin floats way out, but never really goes away.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No Coast, Put the Kid on the Sleepy Horse </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">finds itself in an existential and geographic liminal space, between adult responsibility and spiritual upkeep, between major media centers. And yet, while Braid felt marooned even in Chicago, Mock Orange is based out of Evansville, Indiana, a corridor between the Midwest and the South—bordering Kentucky, equidistant from Chicago and Tupelo, Mississippi. Twenty years in, they’ve finally reconciled the strident, universal yearning of their earlier, midwestern emo phase with the twang of 2011's </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Disguised as Ghosts. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Surprisingly, they’ve dropped any vague sense of alt-country for straight-up southern boogie: the blown-out riffs on “Window” and “Too Good Your Dreams Don’t Come True” sound like they are one <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11618-dan-auerbach/"">Dan Auberbach</a> cosign away from KROQ airplay.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And yet, while this is undoubtedly the greatest eighth album from any band ever tagged as emo, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Put the Kid on the Sleepy Horse </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">itself lacks the true standout moments that would explain what earned Mock Orange their cult status to begin with. The most intriguing hook occurs on “Nine Times,” where brash slide guitars and shifty rhythms pivot into a stately march on the chorus. Elsewhere the choruses cruise rather than soar, and Grisham’s lyrics cut your skin but never draw blood. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brief insight into scene politics aside, most of his judgment is directed at himself for his artistic intransigence. Of course, there’s a cheat code for dealing with this, which is to write about writer’s block:  “There was a time when all my lines kept pouring out, now they’ve gone missing,” he sings, lamenting the “dead end verses on my back.” After the self-deprecating “Too Good Your Dreams Don’t Come True,” the final song is titled “Tell Us Your Story” and it's final line is “I fear I’ve stayed too long.” But the song itself is the first time  on the album Mock Orange sound </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">triumphant</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, so while that might have been his fear, it was worth the past five years to push through it.</span></p></div>"|21880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21880-put-the-kid-on-the-sleepy-horse/|6.5|Ian Cohen

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And, yet, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is an important record in the arc of David Bowie's career—maybe not on the level of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Rise &amp; Fall of Ziggy Stardust &amp; the Spiders From Mars</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21478-low/"">Low</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, but it isn't a stretch to say that the album is partially responsible for cementing Bowie's stardom. When </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> first appeared in May of 1976, Bowie was four years removed from his </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ziggy Stardust</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-fueled UK breakthrough, but he had only recently cracked the U.S. market, with “Fame” hitting number one in 1975</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. He'd remain in the Billboard Top 10 with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21488-young-americans/"">Young Americans</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/"">Station to Station</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and, this, the compilation that closed the curtain on the first act of his career. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bowie would soon decamp to Berlin to reinvent himself as an electronic art-rocker, but </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> isn't especially interested in his progressive side. Some freakiness lies on its margins—the interstellar folk of “Space Oddity,” the coy sexuality of the non-LP single “John, I'm Only Dancing”—but the anchors here are the heavy rockers: “Ziggy Stardust” and “Suffragette City,” “The Jean Genie,” “Diamond Dogs” and “Rebel Rebel.” Riffs rule all, so loud and hooky they obscure whatever faint hint of camp there may lay underneath Mick Ronson's guitars. Those suggestions of a stranger world—all the allusions to aliens, tramps and zombies—are faint transmissions from the depths of the individual albums, but what's here is Bowie at his simplest. This is quite deliberate. He chose the tracks for </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, bypassing actual British hits while elevating “Ziggy Stardust” and “Suffragette City” into the canon by their mere inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That's because </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> turned into a major hit upon its release. It is one of the handful of David Bowie albums to be certified as Platinum in the U.S.—it earned that distinction in 1981, five years after it went gold upon its initial release—an honor </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hunky Dory</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ziggy Stardust</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Station to Station</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Low</span></i>,<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and “<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21487-heroes/"">Heroes</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">”</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> all missed. Odds are </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> would be the one Bowie album that you'd find in a record collection in the '70s and early '80s, and it was designed to be that way. It was meant to be cool, stylish and accessible—as glamorous as the Tom Kelley portrait on the cover—which means </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> deliberately bypasses stranger elements. Absences are abundant, some of them puzzling from the vantage of 2016. “Starman,” his 1972 breakthrough, is absent, as are “Drive-In Saturday,” “Life On Mars?” and “Sorrow,” all singles that peaked at three on the British charts; the Top 10 “Knock On Wood” from 1974's </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">David Live</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is MIA, too. Nothing from </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pin Ups</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is here, nor is there anything from </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Man Who Sold The World</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, not even the title track which is a modern-day standard thanks to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>'s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">MTV Unplugged In New York</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> rendition in 1994.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yet, as this economical compilation plays, none of these tunes are missed. There's an elegance to the structure of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, with its near chronological sequencing lending the album a narrative: it is the story of Bowie's metamorphosis from a quizzical folkie to a conquering colossus. As </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> progresses, the music expands: the brawny glam turns ornate on the second side and then slides into soul, with the funky rhythms supplying an artful ascendance. “Golden Years” ends the compilation on a note of triumph: it plays as a celebration of the self-reinvention showcased on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p>This moment of triumph didn't last long. He traded celebrity for art in 1977, throwing himself off the populist path <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> carves. But the record itself endured, as records do. Audiences who never found much patience of the cubist synths and uneasy aural pools of the Berlin years would find solace with the songs on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, whether they were heard on this old LP, a new hits collection or, most likely, on the classic rock radio that embraced these songs for the very reason they were included on the comp in the first place: these are the tracks that present Bowie at his hardest and straightest. Collected, they provide a summation of his peak as a rock star and, in some ways, remain an excellent introduction to his work: it doesn't tell you everything you need to know, but it captures Bowie's essence and repackages it as a roaring good time. That's reason enough for </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Changesonebowie</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to be back in circulation. </span></p></div>"|21896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21896-changesonebowie/|8.8|Stephen Thomas Erlewine

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The collaborations between Kingdom and Richard were teased last year in both a Rinse FM mix and at an event called “WAVES: Nexus Re-Morph” for the Pérez Art Museum in Miami. At “WAVES,” Kingdom, Richard, and the visual artist Kyselina™ designed a “non-linear R&amp;B opera” complete with a sixty-minute performance filled with insane visuals, Kingdom’s razor-sharp beats, and Richard’s inimitable voice. The event was supposed to capture “the soul of R&amp;B distorted in space-time, and rendered as a high-tech video vortex.” What we get in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Infrared </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is a concentrated form of that vortex, rendered across 14 engrossing minutes. </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Opening up with the three-minute echo-chamber of a love song, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18218-dawn-richard-honest/"">Honest</a>” lays out the themes of the EP: She “just wants to be honest” about the pain of love, the contradictions of break-ups. Her smoky, dulcet voice is at its most raw when she sings lines like “Loving you is like smoking spliffs/It's a temporary high laced with side effects” or “Hate you unless I touch you..I should light this cess smoke until I choke then.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's all complemented by Kingdom’s most pared-down and cushioned production effort. In </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Infrared </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">he’s reached a new level, dissolving down all the best parts of his tropes (very heavy bass, knife-sharp synths, and echoing percussion) into an ideal backdrop for Richard’s velvet voice. He works low key magic all over “How I Get It” where he plays with expectation and hesitance in spectacularly novel ways. As Richard sings “Bitch I don’t lose,” Kingdom lets loose a gentle waterfall of synth notes, elevating her war cry with victorious energy.  The two move</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> seamlessly from the swagger of “How I Get It” to the plaintive doubt of “Paint it Blue” and “Baptize.” She sung “Baptize,” the album’s closer, during her set at the Pérez last year. In the performance, a kaleidoscopic beam of light shines down on her as she pleads to her lover and the world at large to let her voice cure all it all, “Don't be frightened by the thunder/Let the water wash all over...So please be forgiven then we'll baptize you.” In the 14 minutes of Dawn’s brief blue period, she and Kingdom did what few can do—build a diorama for love’s life cycle, encompassing everything from death defying adoration and righteous anger to, best of all, forgiveness.  </span></p></div>"|21923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21923-infrared/|7.7|Kevin Lozano

The band filled their 2013 breakout album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17953-blowout/"">Blowout</a></i> with sketches of their borough’s streets, subways, skylines, and bodegas, guarding each reference with an insistence that in order to truly appreciate these things you had to have grown up there (as singer Alex Levine sees it, the city’s way of life is under constant threat from outsiders). More tangibly, the group’s members also co-founded two of Brooklyn’s big all-ages venues, Market Hotel and Shea Stadium. That’s the kind of legacy contribution to their music scene than few acts can claim. <br/> <br/> Yet in the scheme of the city as a whole, the So So Glos are just a tiny blip. It’s one thing to nurture a music scene, but when condos and dog bakeries are pricing the people you grew up with out of your neighborhood, there’s not much you can do—one punk band alone can’t turn the tide of gentrification. On the group’s latest album, <i>Kamikaze</i>, they’re feeling the weight of that reality.<br/> <br/> “The new New York that we’re living in now is almost unrecognizable to the gritty grime and crime-ridden streets that we grew up on as kids,” Levine lamented to <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6889389/so-so-glos-kamikaze-dancing-industry-stream-premiere-interview-exclusive"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billboard</a>. “It seems like we’re moving in a direction where the movements and art which sprung out of 1960s through 1990s NYC are being celebrated, but there’s very little respect for the environment that harbored the culture. It’s harder than ever to be a working artist in the city and the disparity between rich and poor is becoming greater and greater. People want to see graffiti in an art gallery but not in the streets; they want to see the CBGB toilet behind glass at the Met, rather than sit on it at an actual dive.”<br/><br/>On <i>Kamikaze</i>, Levine often comes across like <i>The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</i>’s Lillian Kaushtupper, a protector of the neighborhood’s endangered Biggie murals and policer of newcomers who look like potential <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> members. It’s a horrible thing, feeling like a member of a dying breed while you’re still in your 20s, and these songs convey a creeping sense that the band is waging a losing battle—not only against gentrification, but also against technology, the passage of time, and possibly even the shelf life on their own ideals.<br/><br/>Recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3588-rocket-from-the-crypt/"">Rocket From the Crypt</a>’s John Reis and mixed by Saddle Creek mainstay <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27943-mike-mogis/"">Mike Mogis</a>, <i>Kamikaze</i> has a slightly slicker, glammier edge than its predecessors, as well as some unobtrusive strings on a couple of tracks, but the peppy backbeats, gang-shouted choruses, and fist-pumping enthusiasm remain. The tension between the band’s perennially youthful sound and their ever-more-jaded worldview that drives the record. Even when Levine rails against technology on “A.D.D. Life,” the sort of meat-and-potatoes, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15948-the-undertones/"">Undertones</a>-styled anthem that John Peel would have loved, he does so with the keen awareness that he’s far from the first punk singer to touch on this stuff. “I’m a too-much-information-generation cliché,” he sneers. <br/> <br/> That’s not the only time he makes himself a target. A <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"">Titus Andronicus</a>-styled mini-epic set to an elbow-jabbing Op Ivy tempo, “Kings Country II: Ballad of a So So Glo” tells of the downfall of two selfie-snapping, phone-addled narcissists. In a final twist, though, Levine stops admonishing the strawmen he’s created and fesses up to his own hypocrisy. “I’m standing in some parking lot staring into my phone,” he huffs. “I guess I am a lot more like those two than I’d like to admit.” It’s easy to write a song condemning technology; it’s a lot harder to lead by example. <br/> <br/> <i>Kamikaze</i> is filled with moments like these, tiny cracks in the seams of the band’s value system. The album’s title conveys not only a willingness to die for the cause, yet also a sense of predetermined defeat. So is it worth falling on the sword for something that no longer exists? And aren’t some changes for the better? <i>Blowout</i> opened with memories of rooting for the truly terrible New York Mets of Levine’s youth. The team has since rebounded—they’re defending National League champions now—yet to hear Levine tell it, he preferred them as underdogs. “I never cared too much for winning, so kiss my ass goodbye,” Levine sings defiantly on “Going Out Swingin’.” If he’s wrong, so be it. He’s chosen his hill.</p></div>"|21929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21929-kamikaze/|7.0|Evan Rytlewski

<p>That artistic impulse must have felt like an alien transmission for someone like Terry Allen, who was raised in a small Texas town. Like fellow Lubbockians <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15153-buddy-holly/"">Buddy Holly</a> and Waylon Jennings, Allen had to get the hell out to realize his vision, though even when he was at art school in LA, he was haunted by a cast of characters that he soon set to a song cycle and series of lithographs titled <i>Juarez </i>(and subsequently as a screenplay and sculptural and video installation).</p>
<p>Pressed up in minuscule quantities the same year that another Texan, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/"">Willie Nelson</a> recorded his own spare song cycle, <i>Redheaded Stranger</i>, <i>Juarez</i> was an outlier even on the “outlaw country” scene: a hand-darned film noir that alludes to the fall of the Aztec Empire, Jesus, motel sex, and the purgatory that is the Rio Grande border. It's now regarded as a touchstone in alt-country but even still, it has more in common with Cormac McCarthy’s Border Trilogy, Mexican folk art, and Terrence Malick’s <i>Badlands</i> than anything in the country genre. And while <i>Juarez</i> has been reissued a few times over the decades, only with Paradise of Bachelors’ deluxe new reissue are Allen’s peculiar visuals again wedded with the music.</p>
<p>Now Allen is more prominently known as a sculptor, painter, and conceptual artist who has been awarded NEA grants and a Guggenheim Fellowship, to where his songwriting takes a backseat to these other practices. But <i>Juarez </i>retains its kick 40 years on. Centered around Allen’s by-turns barrelhouse and contemplative piano playing and his Texas twang (with glints of mandolin, pedal steel, maracas), Allen tells the story of two couples—one a sailor on shore leave with a Tijuana prostitute, the other a pachuco with his girlfriend—and how their encounter ends in bloodshed.</p>
<p>His way with the ivory and his coyote howl of a voice can best be appreciated on the six-minute “Cortez Sail,” seguing from seemingly unconnected scenes in a manner that approaches fine cinema: a rainy highway out of Los Angeles; the landing of Cortez in Mexico; an APB for an outlaw on the run in Colorado, a gun in his lap. Allen is impressionistic and cinematic in his details, such as the image of lightning that tears clouds and then closes that tear in that same instant.</p>
<p>His sparse yet driving music and the trenchant visual work accompanying are noteworthy elements of Allen’s four decades as an artist, but what stands out in revisiting <i>Juarez</i> now is the stunning poetry of the lines themselves. Allen’s words are a piquant kick throughout: raunchy, pithy, and richly redolent. Of course there are quirky lines like “Today’s rainbow is tomorrow’s tamale” at the end of “Radio…And Real Life” that brings a chuckle every time, as does a fantasy about a tryst in the desert, which includes “anal with whipped cream” as jackalopes look on.</p>
<p>But other lines quiver with a raw vision rarely heard in folk or country. On the rollicking “Border Palace,” Allen yowls how “my skinny body slip[s] like a knife into her perfume,” while the sweet “Honeymoon in Cortez” features the image of the TV’s glow glimpsed between toes. And on “There Oughta Be a Law Against Southern California,” Allen threatens with a real ripsnorter: “I’m gonna turn your asphalt back into brimstone.” Whether it’s the side of a cliff or on those tiny black rocks, Allen and his pencil leave quite the mark.</p></div>"|21914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21914-juarez/|8.0|Andy Beta

<p>None of this, however, made the advent of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20190-shadows-in-the-night/"">Standards Period</a> last year any less of a surprise. Some of the initial shock was the result of the growing stigma around the aging-rocker-does-the-American-songbook format, not the fact that Dylan would offer his own version. As he himself acknowledged in his labyrinthine <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/read-bob-dylans-complete-riveting-musicares-speech-20150209"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Musicares acceptance speech last year</a>, this <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/512-the-american-songbook-vs-the-rock-star-five-crossover-standards-albums-done-right/"">sort of record</a> has become a convention—a <a href=""http://www.today.com/id/9700383/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/rod-stewart-standards-are-pure-gold/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">profitable one</a>. At this point, any new release in this vein scans as something more sordid than a stocking-stuffer: an empty money grab.</p>
<p>Dylan’s particular, oddball point in bringing up the trend was to illustrate the absurd degree to which he was still viewed as a man apart. Why did people pore over <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20190-shadows-in-the-night/"">Shadows in the Night</a></i> any more than Rod Stewart’s latest compilation? “In their reviews no one says anything,” Dylan demurred. “In my reviews, they’ve got to look under every stone and report about it.”</p>
<p>But his point doesn’t quite land. After all, <i>Shadows</i>, and Dylan’s second standards set, <i>Fallen Angels</i>, don’t bear much resemblance to the market standard. The latter’s arrangements recall a time and place that never existed—a mythical dive halfway between a resurrected smoky East Village club and, when drooping pedal steel figures dominate the action, a Texas barroom. When creaky cellos and horn soloists crop up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8564-alice-and-blood-money/"">more muted '00s output</a> comes to mind. But this atmosphere sounds like a byproduct of who could make it to the session, how much rehearsal they had time for between tour dates, what Dylan ate yesterday; it doesn’t come over as carefully cultivated.</p>
<p>Dylan doesn’t put a clear twist on this music; it twists him. Devotees judge performers of early–20th-century standards on their ability to interpret—whether they can shape and communicate a song’s meaning with some degree of musical cleverness. But Dylan simply delivers them. In the process, he tends to draw out the strangeness inherent in the compositions rather than making them sound effusive and natural. On opener “Young at Heart,” the close rhyme schemes and overstuffed lines (“Look at all you’ll derive out of being alive…”) draw attention to themselves. On the ubiquitous “Come Rain or Come Shine,” there’s so much precedent for logical ways to approach this song that one can't help but feel like Dylan is deliberately trying to muck it up. “We’re in or we’re out of the money” is faxed out mechanically, the contrast inherent in the line absent.</p>
<p>The languid pacing—often, as down-tempo you could reasonably take these songs—often improves matters. So while Dylan’s breezy take on Hoagy Carmichael’s greatest triumph “Skylark” is a dead-eyed, aberrant disaster, his pliable, conversational intro to the <i>Casablanca</i>/<i>When Harry Met Sally…</i>-famous “It Had to Be You” feels inviting. But some shifts in pacing work. <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>’s amphetamines are a things of decades past, but perhaps some young engineer handed Dylan his first 5-hour Energy to carry off “That Old Black Magic,"" <i>Angels</i>’ closest thing to a barnburner. Here, words spring off Dylan’s lips, rather than becoming saltwater in his throat; his ever-odder, geographically indeterminate accent stays out of the way. He chuckles a bit on the final triumphant release, as if he’s stunned even himself.</p>
<p>The axioms in the songs on <i>Fallen Angels</i> were written to speak to various familiar moments of the human experience. With Dylan, though, the universal “truth” in these compositions—that word is littered throughout his Musicares tirade—doesn’t reflect easily, or even deliberately uneasily, back on him. In his muse Sinatra’s case, of course, such truth came easy: The singer was at the bar until last call in both the tabloids and on his albums, probably bemoaning Ava Gardner’s latest tryst. But there’s no clear through-line to <i>Fallen Angels</i>’ subject matter, no point of view.</p>
<p>The final product, then, feels adrift: just off the coast of delivering a discrete emotional impact, offering a sporadic, self-reflexive charm for fans who smile at Dylan’s every left turn, whether in spite of themselves or on principle. In other words, it’s a new Dylan album: the product of a life ritual no one can fathom, but which is doubtless way more typical than one might think; perennially modest; worth a faithful fan’s money.</p></div>"|21939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21939-fallen-angels/|6.4|Winston Cook-Wilson

But an irony of the genre—and one that Hendrik Weber, who records as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5293-pantha-du-prince/"">Pantha du Prince</a>, understands deeply—is that, though technical by definition, techno is most satisfying when you can feel the human inside the machine. This is the case with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">The Field</a>’s analog loops and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"">Ricardo Villalobos</a>’ live samples; it’s what makes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/"">Holly Herndon</a>’s cerebral experiments compelling and breathes life into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27655-jon-hopkins/"">Jon Hopkin</a>’s chilliest compositions. Like those artists, the tension between organic and synthetic is at the core of Pantha du Prince’s work, from his minimal techno classics, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diamond Daze</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10273-this-bliss/"">This Bliss</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, to<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13947-black-noise/"">Black Noise</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, which saw Weber celebrating nature through field recordings and a collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"">Panda Bear</a>. You can hear it when Weber abandoned the trappings of the genre to experiment with a three-ton bell carillon, usually found in European cathedral towers, on </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17511-elements-of-light/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Elements of Ligh</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17511-elements-of-light/""><i>t</i></a>, and it’s what makes </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Triad</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Pantha du Prince’s first solo record in six years, his most maximalist and emotional release to date.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since the early '00s, Weber has evolved from monastic bedroom producer to an artist who prefers the company of friends, from Noah Lennox to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30960-pantha-du-prince-the-bell-laboratory/"">The Bell Laboratory</a> to Stephan Abry, with whom he created the duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30468-ursprung/"">Ursprung</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. In many ways, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Triad</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> plays like the sum total of Pantha du Prince’s career thus far, uniting Weber's early minimalism with grandiose instrumentation and collaborative songwriting. Though </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Triad </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is billed as a Pantha du Prince release, Weber has lots of help. Joining him are The Bell Laboratory's Bendik Kjeldsberg and Scott Mou, who performs as Queens. Together, the three musicians (and a handful of guests) act as the titular Triad, melding electronic compositions with all manner of analog synths (Synthi 100, ARP, CS-80), vocals, and live instrumentation. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a result,</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Triad</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sounds more like the work of a full band than one guy with a laptop, and it's better for it. Compositions unfurl slowly, starting as sketches before layers of instrumentation blanket one another in unpredictable ways. Weber makes expert use of the human voice throughout, treating his own and others' as additional sonic bricolage rather than the centerpiece of any given composition. Album opener “The Winter Hymn,” for example, begins with a beat, bells, and chimes, before vocals come to the forefront, thawing the track like morning sun on snow. On “Chasing Vapour Trails,” monotone vocals offer a playful counterpunch to the clamor of bells before the track's bouncy rhythm is joined by ragged guitar squalls for an effect reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/"">Matthew Dear</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Speaking of bells and chimes, few producers have a better grasp of how to use them than Pantha du Prince. Even before his work using the bell carillon, Weber's palette relied heavily on metallic tones and percussive elements. On </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Triad</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, these sounds blend fully into the DNA of the tracks—it's not a gimmick or a distraction, but the heart of the sound. The effect is simultaneously cooling (bells have a way of adding a chill to the production) and wholly organic. There's a tactile resonance to their sound that's inarguably </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">physical</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, even when the sound is brittle or delicate, and when a track really goes for the dance floor (see: “You What? Euphoria!”) it hits all the harder. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Listening to a Pantha du Prince record is also a distinctly visual experience. His tracks have a way of enveloping the listener, invoking images of Arctic taigas, snow-capped mountains, rolling hills. Even Weber's track titles—“Islands in the Sky,” “In an Open Space”—ask to be taken as specifically visual experiences. Song titles even directly recall films: “Lions Love” is named after an Agnès Varda film, while “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18271-pantha-du-prince-frau-im-mond-sterne-laufen/"">Frau im Mond, Sterne laufen</a>” references a Fritz Lang dystopia. It's hard to say whether individual listeners will </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">see </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the same things while listening to these tracks, but there is a distinctly synesthetic element to the music.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> The result is an album that creates its own world, one it feels like you could reach out and brush with your fingers.</span></p></div>"|21926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21926-the-triad/|8.0|Nathan Reese

That's an oversimplification of the pioneering musician and composer's history, but it still says a lot about his unique methods. Throughout his 45-year career, Chatham has translated styles associated with instruments like the flute—classical, formal, studied—into the primal power of rock-based electric guitar. This mix of the high-minded and the lizard-brained holds when Chatham plays other instruments, even when he conducts </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9883-a-crimson-grail-for-400-electric-guitars/"">400 of them</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chatham revisits his formative flute/guitar dichotomy on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pythagorean Dream</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, an album he made by himself—a rarity in his heavily collaborative </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://www.discogs.com/artist/584-Rhys-Chatham"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">discography</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. One side focuses on repetitive, ringing guitar, while the other offers a fluid, morphing flute drone. But the approach for both— devout minimalism seeking transcendence via preset forms—is clearly unified, to the point where the two 19-minute pieces rhyme with each other. Both sides loop and build, mimicking the hypnotic repetitions of nature.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chatham uses tape delay to create overlapping lines, in the tradition of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Terry Riley</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/O07QZwl8uac"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">tape loops</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. This allows Chatham to accompany himself, slowly reflecting sounds back and forth in a hall of sonic mirrors. On side one, he also employs </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pythagorean tuning.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> I’m not technically versed enough to hear what difference that makes (nor are most listeners), but I do know there’s a precision to each note and chord that gives Chatham’s guitar a patient reverence, like we’re witnessing wordless prayer. </span></p>
<p>Side two feels even more intimate. As Chatham’s flute tones progress, they get smaller and closer. At points, it sounds as if they’re being whispered in your ear. Throughout, both pieces tremble with giddy energy, but also exude a calm atmosphere in their chiming overtones. In the end, flute and guitar fully unite: The former folds into the latter in a triumphant refrain that soars so high it sounds light-headed, as if Chatham is dizzied by his own playing.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lightness might be seen as a drawback by some of Chatham’s contemporaries, but it’s always been welcome in his multi-toned music. His sunny, humorous personality shines through in everything he does, whether he’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11263-guitar-trio-is-my-life/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">playing with different musicians every night</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> or simply directing an army of players from behind a conductor’s stand. But there's something more naturally personal about </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pythagorean Dream</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, in the way its multitude of vibrations emanate from Chatham alone. He’s using a language that he created—a language that's not hard for other musicians to learn or interpret, but one that only Chatham speaks fluently.</span></p></div>"|21893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21893-pythagorean-dream/|7.6|Marc Masters

And yet their hard-charging goth-punk anthems channeled disillusionment into a full-contact sport, with vocalist George Mitchell screaming himself hoarse as if leading a team downfield to annihilate an opponent. Now, after tearing up the turf on their debut, the Leeds band spend their second album trying to build mountains. </p>
<p>As its anagrammed title suggests, on <i>Ullages</i>, everything has been rearranged, but nothing has changed. The band’s marauding gusto and shoegaze overdrive has been replaced by patient builds, soft-focus interstitials and a dream-pop shimmer. (It’s an evolution highly reminiscent of another band of Brits who traded in goth gloom for Big Rock ambition—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4990-the-horrors/"">The Horrors</a>.) But despite the dramatic scenery change, Mitchell remains committed to ripping out his heart and giving us a close-up of the bruises. The crystalline sound simply allows for an unobstructed view of his anguish and anxiety.</p>
<p>It also lets Mitchell get as close to embodying <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6163-robert-smith/"">Robert Smith</a> as you possibly can without the jet-black palm-tree hairdo and badly applied lipstick. With the throat-shredding barks of old tempered into a yelp, Mitchell wields more control over his voice. Slow-dissolve anthems like “Euphoria” and “Velvet” feel like the biggest breakthroughs here—their stewing sense of despair doesn’t so much erupt as gradually bubble over, as Mitchell invests their verses with the gravitas of choruses through each increasingly impassioned pass. <i>Ullages</i> also betrays Mitchell’s gift for painting his greyscale world with colorful details and knowing, self-deprecating humor: on the sashaying “Psalms,” an inquiry to a palm reader opens with the comically dreary line, “Is our future grey as the slabs on our drives?” And when he sings, “When all the fruits from all my labor plummets over me” on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen/"">Bunnymen</a>-esque “Lemontrees,” you realize he’s only writing about this tropical citrus source because it yields the heaviest foodstuff to drop on his head.</p>
<p>But with its predecessor’s white-knuckled intensity in much more limited supply here, <i>Ullages</i> can sag under the weight of its misery, and struggle to rise above pure <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a> karaoke. It doesn’t help that mid-tempo churns like the soggy-ember torch song “My Life In Rewind” and the “Fascination Street”-grooved “Skipping” respectively use cassette-replay and broken-record metaphors to comment on the often cruel cycle of life, while coming off like repetitive slogs themselves. And the sense of inertia is compounded by an album-closing pair of ballads—“Aisles” and “White Lie Lullabies”—that follow the same route from quietude to climax, both gradually obliterating Mitchell’s presence in a cathedral-toppling avalanche of noise. Eagulls’ debut made its catharsis feel communal—a shout-along salvo like “Possessed” was effectively a group exorcism performed in a sweaty, overcrowded basement punk dive. <i>Ullages</i> opens up a greater sense of space for Eagulls to soar, but can feel more distant and isolating as a result.</p></div>"|21868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21868-ullages/|6.6|Stuart Berman

Founded in 2000, Dial is primarily a hub for the kind of moody minimal techno and crisp deep house espoused by co-founders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7523-lawrence/"">Lawrence</a>, Carsten Jost, and Turner, along with a roster that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5293-pantha-du-prince/"">Pantha du Prince</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5347-efdemin/"">Efdemin</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10842-roman-flugel/"">Roman Flügel</a>. You'd be hard-pressed to find anything resembling a dance beat in Naujoks' catalog, however. His untitled 2009 debut, recorded on piano, marimba, strings, and flute, betrays the influence of composers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> and Wim Mertens, while his 2012 album <i>True Life / In Flames</i>, for piano and marimba alone and recorded in Hamburg's storied <a href=""https://www.elbphilharmonie.de/en/laeiszhalle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laeiszhalle</a>, comes even closer to modern chamber music, right down to a reworking of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"">John Cage</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxZyxRSjMOI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Experiences No. 2</a>.""</p>
<p>What Naujoks shares with his label mates is a propensity for melancholy—his debut album features an acoustic version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEJpmDUMKco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leave Me Alone</a>,"" retitled as ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwH3VoRYurM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Off the Rose</a>,"" that drives home the impression of Naujoks as a moody romantic with his hands stuffed in a tattered wool coat, staring out at the rainclouds over the harbor—and his third album, <i>Wave</i>, is the most exquisitely melancholy thing he's done yet. It's also the most expertly crafted, demonstrating a significant step up as both a songwriter and an instrumentalist. Shifting and narrowing his focus, this time he concentrates on the electric guitar, which is accompanied on a few tracks by his typically spare, searching piano arrangements. This time, there are no vocals at all—a not unwise move, given that Naujok's slightly quavering voice has never been his strong suit.</p>
<p>He avoids distortion for the most part, save some occasional, subtle overdrive, and though he occasionally multi-tracks his guitar parts, you wouldn't necessarily know it without listening closely. There's little in the way of artifice or obfuscation, just ringing delay and reverb that suggest an expanse as wide as the horizon. This is music that presents itself as the sound of things as they really are: metal strings, ivory keys, tape hiss, tube amps. The occasional squeaking of fingers against guitar strings, or the muted clunk of a piano pedal being lifted and lowered, lends to the music's grounded sense of physicality.</p>
<p>Both rhythmically and tonally, these are fairly simple songs, gently tugged between consonance and dissonance, and lullingly repetitive. The moments that stand out against this placid backdrop are often nothing more than small, brief riffs—a trill that pulls against the root note like white foam peeling off the crest of a wave. Lyrical, meditative, and faintly bittersweet, <i>Wave</i> traffics in affect: It is good music for hiking in the high sierra, for late-night drives through rural Maine, for sunsets on the Pacific, for rainstorms anywhere. Favoring major thirds and fifths and major sevenths, it leaves plenty of open space for the listener to project her own emotions into, and it is never cluttered: In the patient ""Playback Room,"" a sedate call and response between piano and guitar, the guitar is only touched some 20 times in the song's nearly four-minute run.</p>
<p><i>Wave </i>frequently brings to mind the work of Factory Records' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"">Durutti Column</a>. Naujoks' wistful melodies and rounded, jewel-toned chords are often strikingly similar to those of Vini Reilly, that group's mastermind and eventual sole member, and so are his atmospheric choices of guitar tone and effects, like the rippling delay of ""Little Dume"" and the burled flanger of ""96 Frames Per Second."" But that's hardly a drawback. The Durutti Column catalog itself often feels a bit like a set of variations on a single theme; that someone new should pick up the torch is a welcome development. And Naujoks' homage breaks new ground on songs like ""Playback Room"" and the title track, in which ruminative piano and guitar figures are spun into gauzy abstraction. The album's only real limitation is that the majority of its songs are all in the same key; given the uniformity of its palette, the songs begin to blend together by the record's end. But if we consider them as a set of variations themselves, that's hardly a grave flaw. It's not surprising that Naujoks is also a visual artist, because ultimately <i>Wave</i> feels like a one-room exhibition: a small gallery full of line drawings or watercolors all in a given style, matted in white and framed in blond wood—tasteful to a fault but still genuinely, even surprisingly, moving.</p></div>"|21920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21920-wave/|7.5|Philip Sherburne

She seems like a transitional spirit from another era—some dark and medieval place, a real-life <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Melisandre"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melisandre</a> with an angelic tenor. Her music, a regal gothic folk, is equally soothing and haunting, and like singer-songwriters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"">Angel Olsen</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27605-laura-gibson/"">Laura Gibson</a>, Nadler doesn’t need much behind her sonically to make an impact.</p>
<p> In years past, it was simply her and and guitar, singing of loss and regret. She occasionally seemed shy or reserved, but she’s opened up more with each album, and on <i>Strangers</i>, Nadler offers traces of her life—discussing personal friends on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18055-marissa-nadler-janie-in-love/"">Janie in Love</a>” and “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18242-marissa-nadler-katie-i-know/"">Katie I Know</a>,” and, on “All the Colors of the Dark,” walking us through the house of an old flame. “Divers of the Dust,” the album’s panoramic opener, wrestles with heartbreak, yet as always with Nadler, she leaves the words open for broad interpretation: “Lying here, on the rocks, with the cliffs disintegrating/Last I heard, in the end, the waves were scraping city streets.” </p>
<p>Compared with Nadler’s 2014 LP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18941-marissa-nadler-july/"">July</a></i>, <i>Strangers</i> moves away from folk into more accessible terrain. Produced by Randall Dunn, who’s worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5467-the-cave-singers/"">the Cave Singers</a>, these sounds are edgier, supplementing Nadler’s bleak aesthetic with layered strings, percussion and guitar, resulting in a rock-oriented sound that lends itself to a wider group of listeners. Even the more pastoral songs like “Skyscraper,” “Waking,” and “Dissolve,” feel heavier, not as gentle as her previous work. Nadler’s music is an acquired taste, but <i>Strangers</i> is probably her most expansive release to date.</p>
<p>As with any Nadler recording, this isn’t a stark turn from her usual vibe. The strength of this album lies in its subtle shifts, the way it casually unfolds without getting stuck. Dunn produces heavy metal, which fits neatly within Nadler's grey-skies approach; even the acoustic songs have a fierceness to them. She's been isolated on her records before, but here the music feels spacious and robust like the workings of a full ensemble in which ideas are allowed to flow.

But of them all, Richard Ashcroft arguably has the longest climb back up the mountain, even when you take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/65423-listen-to-the-stone-roses-new-song-all-for-one/"">the Roses’ DOA “All for One” single</a> into account—after soaring to the top of the pops in 1997 with the Verve’s platinum-plated opus <i>Urban Hymns</i>, his stock has tumbled down unceremoniously through a series of increasingly soppy solo albums released over the course of the '00s. </p>
<p>Like many rock ‘n’ rollers saddled with wild-child reputations, Ashcroft has been accused of going soft in his middle age. The truth is, Ashcroft was flashing his sensitive side way back when the Verve was doing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAhOmYfHpv8&amp;list=RDdAhOmYfHpv8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pretty acoustic versions of “Make It Till Monday”</a> on the promo circuit for their 1993 debut, <i>A Storm in Heaven</i>. However, his solo work has too often highlighted the big difference tenderness and mush, blowing out the resolution of simplistic songs like someone trying to project an iPhone home movie onto an IMAX screen. </p>
<p>In a way, the appearance of the first Richard Ashcroft album in six years is more unlikely than the Roses’ return after 21. After all, in this current gig economy, it’s expected that our favorite groups will reunite for the plum festival guarantees, no matter how acrimonious the initial split. And, having <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12145-forth/"">already played the Verve comeback card in 2008</a>, followed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPA_%26_The_United_Nations_of_Sound"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an aborted attempt at rebranding</a>, it seemed like <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3582930/Descent-of-Mad-Richard.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mad Richard </a>was content to just carry on as Dad Richard. But if the emergence of <i>These People</i> is something of a surprise, its contents are anything but. (Well, other than the fact it took a preaching populist like Ashcroft this long to title a song “Hold On”). The extended layoff has only further entrenched Richard Ashcroft’s desire to make Richard Ashcroft albums, with all the ostentatious orchestration, resurrection rhetoric, bumper-sticker mantras, clunky metaphors, and cursory electro-dabbling those entail.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the early Verve were essentially the missing link between Spiritualized and Oasis, but with <i>Urban Hymns</i>, they anticipated the post-Britpop soft-rock that Coldplay would use to fill stadiums. And though Ashcroft is <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/28/richard-ashcroft-i-wouldnt-trade-what-coldplay-have-achieved-for-any-of-my-songs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">loathe to own that legacy</a>, he and Chris Martin ultimately share similar goals—namely, to retrofit classic, Glastonbury-sized balladry to contemporary Top 40 standards, and sell it to the masses with life-affirming, one-size-fits all-lyrics. Ashcroft still possesses one of rock’s great voices, his singular balance of grit and gravitas undisturbed by the passage of time. But unlike Martin, there’s an inherent weariness to Ashcroft’s singing that meshes awkwardly with his forays into upbeat dance-pop.</p>
<p>The most thrilling moments in Ashcroft’s discography have come when it sounds like he’s getting lost inside his own music, with the surging sonics and multi-tracked vocals pushing him toward rapture. But here, he’s merely singing about going “Out of My Body” over pro-forma disco-house presets rather than actually doing it. That fish-out-of-water feeling only amplifies his lazier lyrics, whether he’s dropping musty Watergate metaphors on that track, or deploying tired heroine-as-heroin cliches about a woman who goes “straight for my veins” on the arms-aloft anthem “This Is How It Feels.”</p>
<p><i>These People</i> supposedly addresses socio-political hot topics like Syria’s refugee crisis and government surveillance, but those inspirations yield precious little insight—as per his solo m.o., Ashcroft transforms real-life tumult into nondescript, placeholder lyrics. And while “Everybody Needs Somebody to Hurt” and “Hold On” respectively recycle the “life’s a bitch” sentiments of “Bitter Sweet Symphony” atop neon-flickered electro-pop and sunrise-rave sonics, their pat advice (e.g., “So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on/You know there ain’t a lot time, but I know that we can make it!”) doesn’t exactly instill you with the fuck-it-all swagger that prompts one to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lyu1KKwC74"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plow into grannies on your morning stroll</a>.</p>
<p>Ashcroft always fares best when he sounds like he’s addressing another person in an intimate exchange rather than megaphoning the entire human race, and there are moments on <i>These People</i> where he reconnects with the steely-eyed conviction and restlessness that fueled his best songs. His reunion with the Verve’s go-to string arranger Wil Malone pays immediate dividends on “They Don’t Own Me,” which plays like a sequel to “Lucky Man,” albeit with the sense of fire-wielding wonderment replaced by hardened resilience. Even better is the atmospheric, dead-of-night rumination “Picture of You,” which mines a haunted melancholy that Ashcroft hasn’t really tapped since “Sonnet” and “The Drugs Don’t Work,” while “Black Lines” yields his most rousing performance in ages. Sure, it doesn’t tell you anything we haven’t heard before: “It’s real life/Sometimes it gets so hard.” But more than just remind us once again about the inevitability of debt and death, the song’s ascendant, string-swept chorus shows Ashcroft still has the ability to make us momentarily forget about it.</p></div>"|21894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21894-these-people/|5.1|Stuart Berman

We’re told to “Smile, baby!” We’re reprimanded for being crazy if we seem too angry or too excited. We talk about “ugly crying,” as if we must apologize for our grief not being romantic or beautiful enough. If we talk about our frustrations or feelings <i>too</i> much, we’re dismissed as fretful, overemotional, or just plain bitchy. But on her debut LP <i>Beyond the Bloodhounds</i>, Nashville’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33697-adia-victoria/"">Adia Victoria</a> (full name Adia Victoria Paul) makes it pretty immediately clear she doesn't give much of a shit about any of this.</p>
<p>Paul’s music has been described as ""creepy,"" a notion that barely scratches the surface of what she accomplishes. The album is often unsettling, yes, but that feeling is more a byproduct of the feelings Paul explores on her gnarled songs than an end in itself. Even the record’s “prettiest” song, the wavy and fuzzy “Mortimer’s Blues,” revolves around Paul’s inescapable loneliness. She approaches love-song territory with “Horrible Weather,” but there, she sings about finding that person whose dark clouds and troubles match yours. Paul powers her songs with muscular, chugging guitars and plodding percussion. Her riffs crackle, snarl, and sneer with subtle country and blues signifiers, and keys alternately thrum and prick on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18209-adia-victoria-dead-eyes/"">Dead Eyes</a>” and “Howlin’ Shame.”</p>
<p>Paul has a knack for crafting drifting lyrical lines that inch under your skin and stay there. Sometimes, they sneak up on you, as in the spoken section that concludes “Invisible Hands.” The track begins with Paul speculating what her fears look like, but when she arrives at “The choir sings Hallelujah from the ovens,” the song becomes outright chilling. <i>Beyond the Bloodhounds</i> isn’t a blues record per se, but in the grand tradition of the blues, it creates space to look your demons in the eye and acknowledge their foul existence without necessarily doing much about them.</p>
<p>On “Stuck in the South,” Paul reckons with feeling trapped on her home turf. She sings that she’s “dreamin’ of swingin’ from that old palmetto tree,” and notes that her skin color “give ‘em cause to take and take.” She promises to leave, but can’t—she’s stuck. Paul’s ache is familiar for many native Southerners: The political and social dynamics of the South are complex and often ugly, as it’s been forever, but for some reason, you stay. Paul’s recognition of her Southern identity goes beyond cloying “hey y’all” affectations. Instead, she weaves together her disgust, frustration, and uncertainty, building a frank look at how she feels about home. From there, Paul closes the record with “Mexico Blues,” lilting as she sings, “You go your way, and I’ll go mine.” It sounds as though she’s still making up her mind about what her own way is, exactly. But with <i>Beyond the Bloodhounds</i>, she’s made a satisfying plunge into decadent darkness.</p></div>"|21935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21935-beyond-the-bloodhounds/|7.9|Allison Hussey

From the outset of her long career, she has created memorable tunes like “Ida Lupino”—a song that appeared on an early album by her onetime husband Paul Bley (and which also appeared on avant-guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12609-mary-halvorson/"">Mary Halvorson</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21027-meltframe/"">recent set of covers</a>). Though when it comes to her full-album statements, she's more difficult to pin down. Her humor can move between the slapstick and the wry. She may stage a straightforwardly goofy album cover, or else use musical quotations in performance in a manner that feels both knowing and politically sincere—as with her work in the late Charlie Haden’s Liberation Music Orchestra.</p>
<p>That mixture of immediacy and mystery quickly earned Bley a following in the worlds of jazz and new composition, one that has remained ardent over the decades. On 2013’s <i>Trios</i>, Bley took the step of letting in an outside producer—Manfred Eicher, the head of ECM Records (which has distributed Bley’s independent label offerings). That album looked back at some of Bley’s past compositional work with a trio that included her longtime bassist and partner Steve Swallow, as well as saxophonist Andy Sheppard.</p>
<p>The same players and producer come together again for <i>Andando el Tiempo</i>, this time to tackle an all-new program of music by Bley, with most of the set devoted to the three-movement composition that gives the album its title. The pianist’s liner notes tell us that sections of this work each “represent stages of recovery from addiction.” Opening track “Sin Fin” finds Bley’s piano spiraling through abstracted tango riffs, her harmonic interplay with the other instruments occupying a frustrated-sounding middle ground, never sounding either totally ebullient or fully despondent. Keening, sorrowful phrases set the tone for a slower middle section, “Potación de Guaya.” </p>
<p>The third movement launches with a striking bit of contrast: a joyous sweep of the piano’s keys, suggesting a strutting exit from the world of addiction. (Bley writes that this bit represents a return to “a healthy and sustainable life”). But all is not automatically set to rights by virtue of the narrative arc; staggered bits of phrases, repeated with a stubbornness, suggest the effort that goes into Bley’s happy ending. </p>
<p>Not everything on the album is this weighty. When titling “Saints Alive!,” Bley says she was inspired by the “expression used by old ladies sitting on the porch in the cool of the evening when they exchanged especially juicy gossip.” The gently swaying piece doesn’t seem particularly scandalized—instead sounding warmly conversational (especially in the communion between Bley’s chords and Swallow’s tender, high-register bass playing). It seems like a song that might be destined to reach “jazz standard” status, alongside “Ida Lupino,” a few decades down the road. Even when she’s not throttling into avant-garde theatrics (as on her early-career highlight <i>Escalator Over the Hill</i>) or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JADPCcpUbu0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing music</a> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> drummer Nick Mason, the casual strangeness of Bley’s aesthetic has been a constant. At 80 years of age, she remains an individual—and still composes like a born melodist, too. </p></div>"|21721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21721-andando-el-tiempo/|7.8|Seth Colter Walls

But I’ve never heard someone sum it up as succinctly as Will Toledo does: “Last Friday, I took acid and mushrooms/I did not transcend, I felt like a walking piece of shit/in a stupid-looking jacket.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s from an eminently quotable song called “(Joe Gets Kicked Out of School For Using) Drugs With Friends (But Says This Isn't a Problem)” on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32785-car-seat-headrest/"">Car Seat Headrest</a>’s new record, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Teens of Denial</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, wherein Toledo feels both boundless and deeply, deeply lame as he tries to sort out his life and shake off the chemicals. He doesn’t transcend, but he sees Jesus. He coins a perfect phrase for emotionally distraught, image-conscious young hedonists—“teens of style”—and becomes sort of disgusted by them, even though he knows he and them are all one and the same. He says “Mmmhmm” a lot, which is all you can do during a gnarly trip. Built around some delicate chord changes, Toledo’s pensive singing voice, and a backing band that slowly comes in as the trip gets worse, it actually sounds</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">like a guy walking around town while sifting beautiful thoughts from the bad ones—a perfect pairing of form and content.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s the best song about being a confused, chemically dependent 20-something I’ve heard in years. Its appearance on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Teens of Denial</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Toledo’s first properly recorded album of new material for Matador, is the moment you realize he’s running ahead of the pack as an incredibly imaginative, insightful singer-songwriter who’s also capable of crafting a dynamic rock song. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Teens of Denial</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> follows last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21121-teens-of-style/"">Teens of Style</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a collection of re-recorded tracks taken from his prolific Bandcamp output. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Teens of Style </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">presented Toledo as a promising young voice, but maybe <i>anyone</i> would sound promising if given the chance to curate and improve upon their best moments over the last five years. <i>Teens of Style</i> was already great, but </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Teens of Denial </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is such a leap forward that it still manages to surprise.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Recorded in a studio with a real band, it’s a continuation of Toledo's every-Matador-band-in-a-blender sound: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>’s soft-loud dynamics, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided By Voices</a>’ jagged pop iridescence, late-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2655-stephen-malkmus/"">Malkmus</a>’ guitar theatrics, all bundled with emotive, immersive lyrics detailing a frazzled state of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to Andrew Katz’s propulsive drumming, some cleaner production, and Toledo’s increasing ambition, it sounds more expansive—a firm declaration of talent, rather than a tease. He packs more ideas into “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18051-car-seat-headrest-vincent/"">Vincent</a>”'s paranoia, “Unforgiving Girl (She's Not An)”'s romantic euphoria, and the allusive, epic “The Ballad of the Costa Concordia” than some bands put into entire albums. On “Concordia,” an almost 12-minute track about navigating one’s inadequacies after a life of substance abuse that slowly builds to a towering release, Toledo seamlessly drops a whole Dido verse in the middle. It comes out from nowhere, but it works. (An earlier version of the album included an excellent song “Just What I Wanted/Not Just What I Needed,” which daringly interpolated the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/690-the-cars/"">Cars</a>’ “Just What I Needed,” but a copyright snafu led to its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/65444-car-seat-headrest-lps-destroyed-because-ric-ocasek-wouldnt-authorize-a-cars-sample/"">cutting</a>. The revised version, “Not What I Needed,” sounds fine, though the censored mp3s making their way around the internet must be heard.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even with the bigger budget and brighter environs, Toledo's underriding DIY sensibility comes through. You can hear it in the margin-scrawl messiness of his lyrics, which forego neat-and-tidy narratives for  abstractions, like he's snatching flitting images that run through his brain. More important than this deft lyrical touch, though, is his ability to display it within a musically engaging song. Unlike some indie-rock songwriters, Toledo's lyrics don't just sit on the page. The choruses don't arrive at the expected moments or follow traditional shapes, but they hit hard nonetheless: The high harmonies on “Joe Gets Kicked Out” and “Drunk Divers/Killer Whales” are destined for festival singalongs, while “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18175-car-seat-headrest-fill-in-the-blank/"">Fill in the Blank</a>” is a burly, driving rock song that might even drive Car Seat’s sensitive listeners to mosh a little. </span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Teens of Denial</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is guitar-driven music filled with booksmart lyrics concerned largely with depression, which naturally means that Toledo has been championed in some circles as an “indie rock savior,” whatever that means. It comes at the same time as a widespread feeling that the idea of “indie rock” itself on the wane. These arguments are often folded into an increased irritation at what might be called “white male ennui,” the root cause of so much stylishly produced music over the last however many years. But depression is colorblind, and Toledo treats sadness not as a stopping point, but as transformative. (At any rate, he’s also multiracial.) There’s an honest reckoning with what his wallowing has led to, and rapturous exhortation when logic alone cannot solve a problem. “I’ve got a right to be depressed,” he yells on “Fill in the Blank,” moments after calling himself out as a little whiner. It’s an emotional conclusion that comes at the beginning of the album, a neat reminder that even after a moment of clarity, there’s always farther to go. </span></p></div>"|21673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21673-teens-of-denial/|8.5|Jeremy Gordon

For artists on the come up, social media can be a digital journal of embarrassing missteps—think web sleuths unearthing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32825-travi-scott/"">Travis Scott</a>’s disparaging tweets about his label boss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"">T.I.</a>—but in a time where catfishing can get you on a TV show, these mostly make for momentary hiccups, not career destroyers. These are ideal conditions for someone like metal-and-folk enthusiast-turned-singsong-rapper Austin Post, now known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33674-post-malone/"">Post Malone</a>, to flourish. He is a rap charlatan for the digital age, and his debut mixtape<i> August 26th</i> is like falling down an acoustic rap cover k-hole.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's worth a quick glance back at the twisty road that led to Post Malone's career. He found ubiquity on Soundcloud last fall with the novelty single “White Iverson,” an homage to the iconic NBA guard. A year and some change earlier, though, he was Leon Dechino, an over-the-top character with a “Tim &amp; Eric”-style surrealist comedy music video called “</span><a href=""https://vimeo.com/128336376"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why Don’t You Love Me.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">” The song was created with help from his friends at TeamCrafted, a collective of gamers dedicated to playing and making tutorials for the sandbox game Minecraft. (In </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ1c9UegK-k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">one of their videos</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Post seems to denounce the song, saying “That’s it. That’s the one song. I’m done making music.”) Before that, he was playing </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_NS9Vd1sMA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bob Dylan covers</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as Austin Richard. As a teen, he was in a hardcore band, a move spurred on by his love of the game Guitar Hero. It isn’t impossible for him to be all of these things at once—hardcore punk, satirist musician, folk singer, diehard gamer, and flex rapper—but there’s something a little disingenuous about going from prodigal son of </span><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-post-4a79691b"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the Dallas Cowboys corporate infrastructure</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to a cornrow-wearing, grill-bearing poster boy for appropriation. When asked about his place in the rap world in an interview with </span><a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/05/14/everything-you-need-to-know-about-post-malone"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Fader</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, he all but admitted this, saying, “At 40 years old, I'm gonna be a country singer. That's down the line.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even if you were to overlook his questionable origins entirely, it's difficult to excuse his shortcomings as a songwriter. Every song is a rap-cliche house of cards, built on some some basic variation on ""balling"": how he's doing it, who he's doing it like, how you aren't doing it. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On “Monte,” the spiritual sequel to “White Iverson,” named for Indiana Pacers guard Monta Ellis, he gets outrapped by Lil Yachty, of all people. </span> He has no legible personality outside the confines of ""marginally famous person excited to trade fame for sex"": On “Get Wit U,” he raps, “Wanna Fuck? I’m almost famous”; on “Never Understand,” he raps, “Said they see me at the show, they was in the front row/ They wanna fuck, I told them bitches come and jump on my bus.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The moments where Post Malone finds the most success on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">August 26th</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are when he highlights his schizoid background instead of trying to hide it. His cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"">Fleetwood Mac</a>’s “Dreams” takes liberties with the melodies and structure before melting down into a backbone for the haunting thumper “Come Down.” The closer, “Oh God,” sounds like it could soundtrack a modern spaghetti western with chords that crunch under his distorted croons. Additionally, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"">2 Chainz</a>-featuring “Money Made Me Do It” is a nice tribute to slain Atlanta rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32881-bankroll-fresh/"">Bankroll Fresh</a> with floating harmonies that settle just below the surface of steel drum synths. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Malone's redeeming trick is his way with melody, and some of them are enchanting, particularly on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a> duet “Fuck,” which vague alludes to the Chicago singer’s “Fuck U All The Time.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The bulk of the production comes from the Atlanta duo FKi, the team behind songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29984-travis-porter/"">Travis Porter</a>’s “Make It Rain,” Travis Scott’s “Sloppy Toppy,” the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31919-rich-homie-quan/"">Rich Homie Quan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> duet “Get TF Out My Face,” and more recently 2 Chainz’s “Watch Out.” A lot of the beats do fun things with hollowed-out synths and dribbling hi-hat patterns, but there isn’t nearly enough firepower to overcome Post’s verses, which are a series of dead-end signs. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's hard to know what Malone should be doing to strengthen his work; he doesn't really have an identity or a true north in his music, a more interesting direction to point towards. This is ultimately his biggest problem:  Complete reinvention can be a fine and sometimes even necessary thing, but if you’re going to be someone else, at least be creative about it.</span></span></p></div>"|21928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21928-august-26th/|5.2|Sheldon Pearce

The Reagan and Thatcher years famously birthed hardcore as we know it; more recently, George W. Bush’s two terms spurred on a generation of bands that expanded the boundaries of post-hardcore, screamo and grindcore. With right-wing demagoguery making headlines and xenophobia on the rise around the globe, another musical backlash could be just around the corner. That might be the idea behind the reunion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33527-head-wound-city/"">Head Wound City</a>, a supergroup whose lineup includes some of the Bush era's most forward-thinking punk musicians: Jordan Blilie and Cody Votolato of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/396-the-blood-brothers/"">Blood Brothers</a>, Justin Pearson and Gabe Serbian of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2504-the-locust/"">Locust</a> and the<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/""> Yeah Yeah Yeah</a>’s Nick Zinner. Up until now, the band’s only formal output was a 10-minute EP written and recorded in the span of a week in 2005. Following some reunion shows in 2014, Head Wound City have now produced <i>A New Wave of Violence</i>, their fittingly-titled full-length debut.</p>
<p>More so than in the past, Blilie and Votolato seem to take the lead on <i>A New Wave of Violence</i>--these songs all bear a close resemblance to the Blood Brothers’ work circa <i>Burn Piano Island, Burn</i>. Of course, Johnny Whitney’s high-pitched squeal and glam affectations are dearly missed, but many of that band’s other signature elements are here: Blilie's dark humor and throat-shredding screams, the pummeling rhythms, songs that barrel forward with a punishing intensity. Votolato, as always, manages to make an impressive racket, with guitars that alternately crash down in waves of fuzz, roar like a jet engine and buzz like a cloud of hornets.</p>
<p>As with <i>Piano Island</i>, Ross Robinson returns to the boards, lending his skilled hand to the proceedings--few producers can capture the live energy of hardcore bands with the sort of fidelity that Robinson does. The upgrade is immediately apparent; where the <i>Head Wound City EP</i>’s sound was defined by DIY muddiness, <i>A New Wave of Violence</i> brings each element in the mix into sharp focus, even as the overall effect is one of crushing heaviness. These songs are felt as much as they’re heard, with every riff, scream and drum hit practically leaping out of the speakers.</p>
<p>Opener “Old Age Takes Too Long” provides a representative sample: a steady march of floor toms, chugging, palm-muted guitars that give way to thunderous choruses and an almost Misfits-like sing-along refrain of “Whoaaa-ohhhh.” “Born to Burn” and “Palace of Love and Hate” are scorched earth campaigns that sprint through multiple verses and choruses in under two minutes (only three of the ten songs here extend beyond the three-minute mark). Longer tracks like “I Cast a Shadow for You,”“Avalanche in Heaven” and “Love is Best” recall some of the Blood Brothers’ best-loved songs–multi-part miniature epics like “Cecilia and the Silhouette Saloon” and “Camouflage, Camouflage”—but in keeping with Head Wound City’s proclivity for brevity, are much more tightly scripted.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a hardcore record that fires on all cylinders, you won’t be disappointed by <i>A New Wave of Violence</i>: here you’ll find a set of skilled players tearing through 25 minutes of music with relentless energy. That said, the latest incarnation of Head Wound City does feel both more straightforward and less ambitious than nearly all of these musicians’ previous projects. You’ll find few of the Locust’s loopy synth lines or breakneck tempos; Zinner seems content to let his guitar follow rather than lead and in the absence of Whitney, it’s hard not to hear Blilie as vaudevillian straight man in search of a foil. That’s only by way of comparison to the band members’ past work, though and Head Wound City is clearly a vehicle for these guys to let their hair down and play some explosive music free of any expectations. Judged on its own merits, <i>A New Wave of Violence</i> is a fine hardcore record, one that manages to balance chaotic intensity with a workmanlike precision that few punk bands can muster.</p></div>"|21898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21898-a-new-wave-of-violence/|6.9|Mehan Jayasuriya

The comedian has dabbled in music already with his Tim &amp; Eric co-conspirators Eric Wareheim and Davin Wood, but the new <i>In Glendale</i> is only his second under his own name (the other is 2011’s <i>Cainthology: Songs in the Key of Cain</i>, ten songs about former presidential candidate Herman Cain).</p>
<p>The ten-track LP arrives via Rado Records, a new Jagjaguwar imprint from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"">Foxygen</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31422-jonathan-rado/"">Jonathan Rado</a>.<i> In Glendale</i> doesn’t quite have such a concrete unifying concept, but it does focus on “normcore” in all its glory—or, more accurately, its lack thereof. Heidecker declares his love for the suburb over anywhere else in America on the opening title track, and without knowing his résumé, it would be easy to mistake “In Glendale” for a painfully earnest tune written by a dad who still desperately wants to be cool. Late in the record, “I Saw Nicolas Cage” feels like a familiar version of the kind of thrilling celebrity non-encounter that one of your relatives recounts at every family gathering.</p>
<p>“Work From Home,” though, is a magnificent tribute to the days when you’re too sick (let’s be real: hungover) to function at work, so you promise to “work from home,” but you’re equally useless there. <i>In Glendale</i> isn’t a riff on the sort of rock that glorifies the difficult common-man endeavors of the American working class. Rather, it’s about the extremely boring real-life shit that most of us deal with every day—to which Heidecker offers a literal nod with “Cleaning Up The Dog Shit.”</p>
<p>But while all the songs are fun, there’s an occasional dark streak that elicits nervous laughter as much as anything else. Heidecker begins “Ghost in My Bed” with “I put your head in a plastic bag and I buried it under the Hollywood sign,” before detailing the thoughts of a killer who was probably just a regular guy having a good time before the whole murder situation happened. Likewise, “I Dare You To Watch Me Sleep” reads like a creepy letter from a stranger. They’re so at odds with their otherwise unassuming instrumentation, and fit in so neatly among their counterparts, that you can miss them on a casual first pass.</p>
<p>All jokes aside, <i>In Glendale</i> actually <i>is</i> a pretty slick rock record. From any other outfit, it would be a solid effort, with horns and keys providing muscle to every song. Even the piano-led coda of “Ocean’s Too Cold” sounds like it could’ve been lifted from any other polished indie rock record. Heidecker manages to sneak humor into the liner notes, too: every player is noted parenthetically as “other featured artist,” while Heidecker is noted as a “contracted featured artist.” Like the rest of his comedy oeuvre, Heidecker pulls no punches. <i>In Glendale</i> arrives as a fully formed beast, equal parts parody and confession of our universal lameness. Heidecker is definitely laughing at himself and most of us, too—whether you drop your self-importance is up to you.</p></div>"|21875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21875-in-glendale/|6.5|Allison Hussey

Besides broadcasting the news of a massive tailgate onto nationwide cable systems, the station pumped the band’s “comeback” hit “Touch of Grey” a few times an hour. While the 22-year-old sextet was already capable of selling out Giants Stadium, MTV’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VU3kVW30LU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Day of the Dead</a>” report fully transubstantiated the Grateful Dead and the Deadheads from an underground phenomenon into a legitimate part of mainstream American culture, as much an '80s phenomenon as a '60s band. Until Jerry Garcia’s death in 1995, the Grateful Dead would grow more popular each year, the Day of the Dead extending to nearly a decade. The director of the band’s ticket office and others would point to the MTV special as the tipping point towards the gate crashes and mini-riots of the '90s.</p>
<p>It was this popularity, too, that codified the deep uncoolness of the Grateful Dead during the same years, at least among a certain taste-making elite. Being anti-Dead had been part of the uniform for years (see the Teen Idles’ “Deadhead,” from Dischord’s very first 7” in 1980). That attitude, too, went mainstream a decade or so later, via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6161-kurt-cobain/"">Kurt Cobain’</a>s homemade “<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=cobain+%22kill+the+grateful+dead%22&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK9pHfkOTMAhXDDj4KHSGqCfcQ_AUIBygB&amp;biw=1150&amp;bih=805"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill the Grateful Dead</a>” shirt. The Grateful Dead boogied, perhaps occasionally achieved choogle; some of their fans were definitely on serious drugs, egregiously friendly, and stood out in crowds. They were easy picking for punks and the DEA alike.</p>
<p>This year’s <i>Day of the Dead</i> is a new 5xCD , five-and-a-half-hour compilation produced by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">National</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27735-bryce-dessner/"">Bryce</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7136-aaron-dessner/"">Aaron Dessner</a> as a benefit for the Red Hot organization. With a cast of dozens drawn from a cross-section of indie-ish musical worlds, the set, like its MTV predecessor, signals another milestone in the San Francisco band’s profound influence on American music, closing old circles and opening new ones. In the same way that no single Grateful Dead show (or song performance, or even era) could ever be definitive, the 59 tracks of <i>Day of the Dead</i> represent (merely!) a major entry in the ever-deepening catalog of Grateful Dead covers, interpretations, and reinventions. Already containing universes, the Dead’s songbook is what makes the set enjoyable as a whole, transcending the performers and their translations. Perhaps even more than those of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> (no stranger to covering the Dead), the songs of Jerry Garcia and lyricist Robert Hunter welcome musicians of all stripes—loud and quiet, singers and instrumentalists, big-eared non-virtuosos and players alike.</p>
<p>With an artist list that connects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Mumford &amp; Sons</a> (who blanch the Satanic urgency right out of “Friend of the Devil”) to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5003-so-percussion/"">So Percussion</a> (who carry “Terrapin Station (Suite)” to thrilling new realms), the set ranges eclectically in both style and level of inventiveness. Most anyone with any kind of appreciation for the Grateful Dead will find probably at least an hour or three of music to dig and really groove with; Dead freaks might also find a good deal to snicker at.</p>
<p>Where the Dead’s critical revival on the fringes of the early 21st century freak-folk scare hinged on the band’s weirdness (LSD, musique concrète, countercultural activity, untethered improvisation), <i>Day of the Dead</i>’s reclamation feels comparably restrained. Though the contributions nod at various Day-Glo threads, the core of the project is made from the softer colors and textures that have defined indie rock in recent years. At the center is a National-anchored house band that come off as conservative literalists compared to the Dead themselves—pleasant, but not usually taking the music anywhere especially new. Instead, they treat the songs as new standards (which they are), pairing them with vocalists. Just as the Dead’s hardcore '60s experimentation dissolved to messy stadium-sized calypso thunder, <i>Day of the Dead</i> is more dancing bears than skull-and-lightning <i>Steal Your Faces</i>. But fun prevails and sunshine abounds, and the set manages to capture a wide range of available Grateful Deads, channeled via Senegalese jazz groovers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5806-orchestra-baobab/"">Orchestra Baobab</a>, noise sculptor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a>, and many more.</p>
<p>Among the few to really nail the Dead’s communal and conversational bounce, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26519-stephen-malkmus-and-the-jicks/"">Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks</a> take a reassuring and natural turn through a <i>Europe ’72-</i>style “China Cat Sunflower-&gt;I Know You Rider,” Robert Hunter’s Joycean psychedelia finding its perfect match in Malkmus’ quizzical tongue-twisting. Other bands apply their own filters, highlighting bands the Grateful Dead maybe even wished they were. Representing the kinder, gentler side of the nu-Dead revival, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a> cleanses “Here Comes Sunshine” of its hippie jazz pretensions and buffs it into the AM gold the Dead themselves couldn’t quite conjure for 1973’s <i>Wake of the Flood</i>. On the far left of the dial, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"">Oneida</a> drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17456-kid-millions/"">Kid Millions</a> conducts a hyper-condensed realization of “drums/space” that draws a direct line from the Dead’s infamous second-set jam session to present day Brooklyn. Joined by So Percussion for “drums” (who shimmer like Mickey Hart’s most melodic dreams), Oneida tumble episodically from drone to synth swirl to stoned guitar chatter, covering a familiar through-line with an un-Deady focus. It is the centerpiece of one of several <i>Day of the Dead</i> sequences that approximate the Dead’s ever-variable song-suites.</p>
<p>In this way and others, the Dessner brothers find different ways to interpret the Dead, in micro and macro, letting artists stand in for the band’s various sides. During the set’s approximated jam sequences on the second and third discs (<i>Lighting</i> and <i>Sunshine</i>, respectively), the Dead’s weirdness shines through, including a father/son space-dub jam-out by Terry and Gyan Riley on a near total reconstruction of Bob Weir’s “Estimated Prophet” (yes, <i>that</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>). The band’s jam flagship “Dark Star” gets several treatments, including a happening studio improv labeled “Nightfall of Diamonds” and a full pass by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a>, where the Oklahoma psychedelicists translate the song’s theme into a krautrockin’ bassline and build a jam that doesn’t so much go anywhere as build a safe space for Dead freakdom in whatever galaxy the Lips are occupying these days.</p>
<p>More than nearly any other act that might be considered for a massive multi-disc tribute, Grateful Dead songs retain a three-dimensional historical presence. Even the most casual fans know that each Dead tune comes available in a range of versions from a variety of periods in the band’s history, at varying tempos and with different collections of musicians and gear and drug habits. <i>Day of the Dead </i>serves a variety of purposes, and at its best engenders genuinely fresh perspectives combined with excellent performances. Like many a Dead show, it doesn’t always hit the mark, but unexpected magic emerges often enough to make the whole operation worthwhile: over here, a spooked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2057-lee-ranaldo/"">Lee Ranaldo</a>/Lisa Harrigan duet on “Mountains of the Moon”; over there, Bela Fleck’s banjofied “Help on the Way/Slipknot” drawing the connections between Garcia’s mid-’70s prog period and his own banjo roots.</p>
<p>Some of the most exhilarating moments come during songs the Dead themselves didn’t give much attention to, like “Rosemary“—nitrous-washed on 1969’s <i>Aoxomoxoa </i>and barely played live—which finds a freaky-folky new setting with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30440-mina-tindle/"">Mina Tindle</a> (and Friends) uncovering the song as a melodic precursor to Garcia and Hunter’s more accomplished later work. Providing more subtle renovations, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a> (who previously recorded a gorgeous “Brokedown Palace” for a 2004 tour single) rightly earns three slots on the collection. On “If I Had the World to Give,” played by the Dead in 1978 and dropped, he pulls the rare trick of creating a performance perhaps more definitive than the Dead’s own, stripping the song down to only piano and erasing the '78 Dead’s two-drummer pomp. He doesn’t quite manage the same feat on “Rubin and Cherise” (a solo Garcia staple, played a few times by the Dead in 1991), but finds his own Bonnie turn on the song, yo-yoing from Garcia’s preferred melody but standing astride and moving freely inside Robert Hunter’s magic-touched world in a way that many of the other singers here don’t manage.</p>
<p>What is most surprising, maybe, is that—on a tribute to a fundamentally guitar-driven band—the guitar and its inevitable solos are deemphasized. There are guitar <i>moments</i>, of course, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29384-william-tyler/"">William Tyler</a>’s Garcia-gone-countrypolitan curlicues that dot <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30386-hiss-golden-messenger/"">Hiss Golden Messenger</a>’s “Brown Eyed Women” and a hypnotic 10-minute “Wharf Rat” fronted and jammed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>’s Ira Kaplan, though on the latter the guitars themselves are gently blurred into a Nationalist haze. On a live <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> version of “St. Stephen” featuring the Dead’s Bob Weir, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/778-nels-cline/"">Nels Cline</a>’s unceasing lead torrents stand out, perhaps the closest anyone on the collection comes to Jerry Garcia’s own approach. But it is over the past decade and change, as well, that Garcia has become fully accepted into the alternative pantheon, an audible pillar of American guitar alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"">John Fahey</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"">Television</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>, and others, and <i>Day of the Dead </i>is a ripple in an already busy pond. A new all-star set Dead tribute could be assembled every year or two and the range of interpretations might never be exhausted, such as on <i><a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/audio/tracks/listen-to-a-track-from-wfmu-fundraising-album-of-grateful-dead-covers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Songs to Fill the Air</a></i>, an exquisite folk-leaning tribute CD-R issued as part of WFMU's annual fundraising marathon this spring.</p>
<p>In some regards, the only question is how long the current revival can possibly last. With five-and-a-half-hours here that range from art-song rewrites (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33370-anohni/"">Anohni</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30072-ymusic/"">yMusic</a>’s “Black Peter”) to fantasias about what it might’ve sounded like had the Dead said “yes” to Bob Dylan’s request to join them permanently in 1989 (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"">War on Drugs</a>’ “Touch of Grey”), it would seem we may’ve reached peak Dead, if history hadn’t already concluded such a thing to be impossible. But to top it, some of the surviving bandmembers will tour baseball stadiums this summer under the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60922-grateful-dead-members-and-john-mayer-announce-dead-company-tour/"">Dead &amp; Co.</a> logo, minus Phil Lesh and accompanied by John Mayer. While they might not be producing new material (other than a jam or three), Dead &amp; Bro, combined with the Dead’s current fashionability, could likewise constitute something large enough for another generation of musicians to define themselves against—at least until they discover <i>Live/Dead</i> and/or LSD. In the mean time, extending the Deadhead tape trading network of the '80s (where live versions of “Touch of Grey” were a hit a half-decade before Arista Records or MTV got their hands on it), the Dead’s songs will continue to flow by their own folkways.</p></div>"|21771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21771-day-of-the-dead/|8.1|Jesse Jarnow

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The similarities end there: Lee’s never been given nor has he sought out “voice of a generation” plaudits. <i>Skip a Sinking Stone</i> is invariably gentle, speaking for Lee and maybe those around him.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Let’s take the long way home, let’s throw away our phones,” Lee sings moony-eyed during the very literal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18159-mutual-benefit-lost-dreamers/"">“Lost Dreamers,”</a> a song which establishes Mutual Benefit as a natural convergence point between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13771-neil-young-everybody-knows-this-is-nowhere-after-the-gold-rush-harvest/"">Harvest</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and early 2000s freak-folk; this is the prevailing theme of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skip a Sinking Stone’s </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">first half, where touring is just a mind-expanding road trip that happens to be interrupted by occasional load-ins, blog interviews, and stints at the merch table. “And if we get lost in a dream, wasn’t it worth all we’ve seen?,” he asks. It can all seem at odds with reality, but </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skip a Sinking Stone </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is just at odds with the harried, hassled perspective that voluntarily serves as reality for most; Mutual Benefit never tries to force its viewpoint or really much of anything on the listener.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Besides, Lee’s POV is wholly embedded in Mutual Benefit’s music, so if you want to take his sentiments to task for being a little cloying, you might as well criticize the string parts for being too pretty. But even if this is a </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">gorgeous </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">album, fantastically so, that quality is occasionally to its detriment. “I’m so afraid to fall in love again, I know how it ends,” Lee sings on “Skipping Stones,” and that’s about as dark as things can get here. When “City Sirens” alludes to police brutality and Eric Garner’s death, the problem isn’t that the tonal shift is too jarring; it’s that there’s barely any at all. Though heartfelt and honest as everything else, a very specifically rendered line like “killers exposed through broken windows/there’s oaths they swore but what’s it all for?” hits with the same impact as “If there’s one thing I know, it’s that all the good times go, and the hard times too.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Love’s Crushing Diamond,</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9273-mutual-benefit/"">Lee admitted</a> he was wary of attaching any kind of story to his music, let alone his radical politics. And it seems like even stories as commonplace as “the road” and “New York” can moderate the ineffable magic of his previous work. Likewise, the mindset of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skip a Sinking Stone </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is best entered with the intent of total immersion and allotting a similar amount of Mutual Benefit music to more conventional song structures and interludes can feel like a vision quest stopped too frequently for bathroom breaks. But the enduring sadness in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Love’s Crushing Diamond </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">was drawn from Lee witnessing the destructive force of escapism in others. So if the newfound pragmatism and stability of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skip a Sinking Stone </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">seems inevitable for Lee after Mutual Benefit’s success, an inveterate dreamer can’t help but make it sound transitional.</span></p></div>"|21725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21725-skip-a-sinking-stone/|7.0|Ian Cohen

He too is infatuated with VHS culture, infomercial soundtracks, primitive video games, bad TV cop shows and the distorting haze of memory. But while someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"">James Ferraro</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> would deploy samplers, synths, or computers to playfully deconstruct those memories, Torn Hawk’s weapon remains that other '80s artifact: the electric guitar.</p>
<p>Tape-chewed textures and digital glitches initially defined Wyatt’s first few releases, but there’s a remarkable clarity throughout <i>Union and Return</i> that belies the fact that for all the beauty of his fourth album, his inherent weirdness still squirms beneath the surface. “The Romantic” opens with a flutter of bowed cello, woodwinds, and a wordless female voice before Wyatt’s sparkling guitar and stutter-step drums come to the fore. It's anthemic, right down to the fanfare of brass and wordless choir that arises midway through, suggesting that Wyatt has cast off the trappings of his previous albums to embrace a minimal, classical sound palette. Whiffs of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGKfEAPTrVI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meredith Monk</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Stu7h7Qup8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glassworks</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X9axuH2iRo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mark Isham</a> abound. The sound is so clean and meticulous that it’s hard to reconcile with his fuzzier, lo-fi output.</p>
<p>Throughout, Wyatt’s guitar work brings to mind the legendary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5842-manuel-gottsching/"">Manuel Göttsching</a>, whose leads were crystalline and cosmic at once, suggesting New Age and progressive rock without settling into either camp. But the guitar here is a changeling, ringing like a bell and then dovetailing with piano, French horns, or swells of strings. One might think that Torn Hawk has evolved into a new music ensemble, but the melodic turns are so tight and precise that it’s hard to imagine them as the work of humans. Instead, Wyatt's guitar is played against a bevy of virtual instrumentation, multiple synthesizer layers stacked to dizzying heights. The drama of album highlight “With My Back to the Tower” stays just this side of bombast with its stacked brass and voices, while “Feeling is Law” continues that opulence: elegant and light on its feet. But for all of the song's brightness, darker tones seep out at the edges, casting doubt for brief moments before receding again. </p>
<p>It suggests a grandeur that begins to feel a bit like madness, the songs so filled with teeming details and turns that it’s easy to get lost in them. It can bring to mind car chases, the pomp of a <i>Game of Thrones</i> ceremony, and the music of a motivational speaker (something that Torn Hawk toys with in <a href=""https://thump-images.vice.com/images/2016/04/13/torn-hawk-union-and-return-interview-with-my-back-to-the-tower-stream-body-image-1460554992.jpg?resize=1220:*&amp;output-quality=75"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">promo photos</a>). Its clean fastidiousness becomes <i>Union and Return</i>’s weirdest attribute, akin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"">James Ferraro</a>’s sleek pop polymer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15992-james-ferraro-far-side-virtual/"">Far Side Virtual</a>. But while closer “Die Swimming in the Sea Here” retains the sonic attributes of the rest of the album, Wyatt emphasizes the gorgeous melody of the song, so straight and stirring so as to suggest end credits. How long until he moves beyond warping imaginary soundtracks and actually composing them himself?</p></div>"|21912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21912-union-and-return/|7.3|Andy Beta

The UK albums chart is full of iconoclastic British acts—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a> at #1, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5921-skepta/"">Skepta</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33370-anohni/"">Anohni</a>—with very few of them plying their trade on guitar. Even trad-lad bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30622-the-1975/"">the 1975</a>, Catfish and the Bottlemen, and Blossoms have seen the smart money and embraced their boyband potential rather than doggedly committing to life in the indie trenches. Twenty years since Britpop's rot set in, and 10 years on from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys/"">Arctic Monkeys</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/497-whatever-people-say-i-am-thats-what-im-not/"">debut album</a>, the path to indie success is codified, but a source of ever-diminishing returns; there's the sense of a generation with just enough education to perform, but not really to innovate the genre out of irrelevance.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31270-oscar/"">Oscar</a> Scheller's debut album, <i>Cut and Paste</i>, isn't going to do that either, though a decade ago it might have propelled him to the heights of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5645-jack-penate/"">Jack Peñate</a>, another British cheeky chappy with strong pop instincts. The young Londoner makes blown-out indie jams with magnetic melodies and an obvious British lineage: “Sometimes” echoes the melody of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a>'s “Coffee and TV,” and his leaping baritone bears a strong resemblance to both Damon Albarn and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a>. (For the latter, see also, “But then I see your face and I want to die,” from “Fifteen,” which moves at the pace of a carnation's twirl.) He samples, or rather, for budgetary reasons, emulates samples of old school hip-hop and chintzy dub—“Good Things,” laced with his plaintive croon, sounds a lot like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"">Saint Etienne</a>'s cover of “Only Love Can Break Your Heart.” The combination aligns him with a non-British Anglophile: Scheller's romantic, hotch-potch confections recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2590-jens-lekman/"">Jens Lekman</a>'s early records, and share a similarly endearing innocence.</p>
<p>His lyrics are also naïve, but lack Lekman's charm and wit. They're mostly underdeveloped portraits of youthful anxieties: over masculinity (not knowing which football team to support), the passing of time, and whether the promised future will come to pass. “Nothing's as it seems/There's a land where hopes don't meet with dreams,” he croons on the twinkling, dreamy “Gone Forever,” the record's sharpest song. “I feel scared of all the things to come.” As for his own future, Scheller has written for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4842-lily-allen/"">Lily Allen</a> and short-lived <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5030-sugababes/"">Sugababes</a> revival <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31178-mutya-keisha-siobhan/"">MKS</a>. <i>Cut and Paste</i> is hooky and appealing; with a gear change, he could easily move into a realm where people are actually paying attention. For now, he's a very sweet stream in a cultural backwater.</p></div>"|21865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21865-cut-and-paste/|6.5|Laura Snapes

The billboard showed a hellish crack in the ground oozing a toxic green light. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31482-jessy-lanza/"">Jessy Lanza</a> started seeing these advertisements right around the time she moved into her co-producer Jeremy Greenspan’s (of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2229-junior-boys/"">Junior Boys</a>) home to write her sophomore album </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oh No. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">She was also convinced right around the same time, that the air quality in their shared home was poisonous. In order to fight the incoming entropy, she surrounded herself with tropical plants to clean the air, and she completed an album that recycled the bad voodoo into something remarkably generative and self-assured.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> She told the <i>FADER</i> that in general  she’s “always thinking of ways to alleviate waking up every day and feeling a deep sense of dread.” </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oh No</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in its own way is about harnessing anxiety and estrangement—imagining how all of her bundles of pent-up nervous energy could be harnessed into a productive flow. The music here is what happens when you turn that faucet on and let all the power just stream out. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oh No </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">i</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">s a gorgeous and deadly pop music manifesto that proves yet again the sad girls are not vulnerable and silent subjects. Or as Lindsay Zoladz once wrote, music in this mode is not exactly “sadness” but an expression of  a “particular kind of strength—one that allows the contradictions, complexity, and emotional range of a lived experience.” </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the last three years since her debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18472-jessy-lanza-pull-my-hair-back/"">Pull My Hair Back</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, it's obvious by just listening to this album that both her singing and production efforts have matured exponentially. The songs are freewheeling collages of  '90s R&amp;B, Chicago footwork, acid house, disco, and wonky minimalist pop, using simple instrumentation to span multiple moods and BPMs. Meanwhile, Lanza’s singing works overtime, lifting boulders and throwing them across city blocks. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Her lyrics are blunt and straightforward, but her singing allows her to imbue even the most casual and static of statements with a sense of devastating irony. For example in “Going Somewhere” she treats pandering and all its silent erosion with subtle shifts in phrasing, hiccuping in the middle of lines like “Say you love me” and “Baby I just want to impress you"" as if she was almost giggling at the thought. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The exhortations of hurt in Lanza’s songs are not coming from the perspective of someone sulking over their wounds, but a place of triumphant reclamation. The production and her singing on this album reach full symmetry in the album’s centerpiece, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17944-jessy-lanza-it-means-i-love-you/"">It Means I Love You</a>.” It’s a frenetic blend of footwork surrounding a supine ballad of loss. It tastefully samples a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU4Vb_Atp0Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tabla beat</a> from a South African song, and swaddles this percussion in slashing synths. Her voice carries along with the instrumentation in a deathly shadow dance, mimicking its jerky changes in tempo and pitch effortlessly. It all stops just for a moment when she tells the listener, and the beloved, to look into her eyes, because that's when you it means she loves you. In that pocket of seconds, it feels like you’ve been turned into stone. </span></p></div>"|21802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21802-oh-no/|7.9|Kevin Lozano

The group’s oft-discussed past includes violence, jail time, and a mob of hardcore guys wanting to beat up singer/guitarist Domenic Palermo. Before forming Nothing, Palermo spent two years in jail for stabbing someone at a show. (Notably, the group's 2014 debut was titled <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19071-nothing-guilty-of-everything/"">Guilty of Everything</a></i>). Maybe as a result of the incident, he was jumped this past year in Oakland and suffered brain trauma.</p>
<p>Beyond the extracurricular activity, members of Nothing have played in hardcore and punk bands before their current gig—bassist Nick Bassett was in an early incarnation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>, then founded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30251-whirr/"">Whirr</a>. Nothing’s dark, sarcastic online presence (they’ve beefed with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a>, after all), youngish punk fanbase, and current label affiliation are the marks of a more aggressive act. But the music they make is gentle, springtime shoegaze with a '90s alt-pop sensibility. If you weren’t aware of the story around the group, you wouldn’t guess at their gritty past or present.</p>
<p>That is, until you start digging. Life doesn’t amount to much on <i>Tired of Tomorrow</i>; the lyrics are filled with existential fear, boredom, anxiety, decomposition, infection, and disease. Life's seen as a nightmare with humans “made of blood and semen/piss and shit.” Elsewhere, people are empty, “useless,” and “sifting through decay.” On “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18049-nothing-vertigo-flowers/"">Vertigo Flowers</a>,” named for the dizziness Palermo suffered after being jumped, he angelically sings: “Watch out for those/who dare to say/that everything will be okay/Watch out for those/who want to be/anything at all.” As you may have guessed by now, “Everyone Is Happy” is not about being happy. (Weirdly, “Eaten by Worms” kind of is.)</p>
<p>There are some love songs, too, and they don’t end well. On the fuzzed-out, hypnotic “ACD (Abcessive Compulsive Disorder),"" which brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1996-hum/"">Hum</a>, Palermo, in a more romantic mode, sings: “Swallow, corrosive confection/Decay, rotting in your wound/I can, wallow in your filth/I live to” before adding “You know me and you know I am not well…/And I will leave you/With a bad taste in your mouth.” People cry, then glide or get pushed away.</p>
<p>But those are just words, and as Palermo would be the first to tell you, words are useless. The guitars, though, are sumptuous, humming, and pure. “Curse of the Sun” sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> and the<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/""> Smashing Pumpkins</a> collaborating. Nothing recorded <i>Tired</i> with Will Yip (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31620-title-fight/"">Title Fight</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/450-braid/"">Braid</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31541-balance-and-composure/"">Balance and Composure</a>), and he deserves a lot of credit for creating an invitingly deep sound. It’s familiar but new; varied but consistent; full of ambience but sturdy. The guitars are light and pretty but register plenty of muscle. A piano drifts in and away without messing up the flow.</p>
<p>In the gorgeously warped, drifting “Nineteen Ninety Heaven,” Palermo intones, hazily, that “life’s a nightmare.” But while these sounds can often feel like outtakes from<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/""> <i>Siamese Dream</i></a> with a more depressed and inward vocalist, you’d be wrong to take the bait and call the record a<i> </i>""Siamese Nightmare""—as dark as the lyrics are, it's not shocking or scary. It's more of a sweet reminder. In fact, <i>Tired of Tomorrow</i> has been my go-to warm-weather record, a collection that <i>sounds</i> happy, and more importantly comforting, even when you know, as you always did, that there's no point in going on, but that we all do anyhow.</p></div>"|21676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21676-tired-of-tomorrow/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

Think about that little bit of major chord respite offered by the ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1tj2zJ2Wvg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m23s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">when you're high, you never ever wanna come down</a>"" part of ""Welcome to the Jungle"" or the ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-90SPx6Xfwo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h39m40s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I've been to the edge, and there I stood and looked down</a>"" monologue of ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love."" These gentle flashes invite you into dangerous orbits, despite their narrators' warnings, with an illusion of safety that makes you overlook the whole ""and you're gonna diiiiiiie"" part. On <i>Pile</i>, which is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33639-a-giant-dog/"">A Giant Dog</a>'s third official full-length, the Austin band mix moments of sweetness with a whole lot of ""and you're gonna diiiiiiie."" </p>
<p>The first refrain we hear from singers Sabrina Ellis and Andrew Cashen says it all: ""But I love you, honey/Stay away from me/Tenderness is not for me/I could watch you die and not feel a thing."" Every track is a similar mix of certain danger and uncertain asylum. Five of the album's 15 tracks deal explicitly with death, mostly with a nonchalance that has been a hallmark of rock ‘n’ roll since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10410-bo-diddley/"">Bo Diddley</a> bragged that he was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAGoqMZRLB4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=48s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">just 22 and didn’t mind dying</a>. In the catchy chorus of the first single, ""Sex &amp; Drugs,"" Ellis and Cashen sing, ""I’m too old to die young,"" their voices stuck together in honeyed harmony against distorted guitars, a swinging rhythm section, and plinking ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8PiA0FAYBI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=36s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crocodile Rock</a>"" piano boogie. Later in that song, they rattle off a list of the self-imposed harm they have survived, including ""all the people we fucked, and all the hippies who sucked, and all the hearts that we broke, and all the liquor and coke."" </p>
<p>That the songs dwell so much on mortality feels like a way of acknowledging grief rather than ignoring it, even if they're dealing with it in a depraved way, using juvenile humor to process fear. (At one point in ""Too Much Makeup,"" they suggest that you ""get reborn as a tampon when you die."") Many of the songs on <i>Pile</i> might feel more offensive if the hooks weren't so strong, and if Ellis didn't have amazing pipes. But the combination of pretty melodies and the ugliest of realities is what drives <i>Pile</i>: it feels like the playlist for a rock-bottom party, made by people who are in a bad place, taking the opportunity to celebrate it before rising above it. They sing and play with the enthusiasm of a last hurrah. It's a rare cocktail that mixes sloppy punk passion with precision, but A Giant Dog have both working for them.</p>
<p>Mike McCarthy, who has produced albums for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon/"" target=""_blank"">Spoon</a>, in addition to A Giant Dog's less adventurous 2013 LP, <i>Bone</i>, helps make the morbid mood festive, capturing the band's blend of punk rock and glam, and bringing out a performance from the two singers whose energy betrays the jaundiced lyrics. Yes, it's often nasty, but it's also funny. When Ellis sings about a friend who’s an undertaker, who comes home smelling of ""formaldehy-eeee-iiiiide,"" it's clear that she's having fun. Ellis and Cashen also play together in a poppier band called <a href=""http://www.sweetspiritatx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sweet Spirit</a>, which is also true to its name, and not as dangerous or dirty as A Giant Dog. It’s like with A Giant Dog they've found an outlet to unload all of their basest instincts, so Sweet Spirit can stay sweet.</p>
<p>In ""Get With You and Get High,"" the band are joined by fellow Austin musician and unlikely bedfellow <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/472-britt-daniel/"" target=""_blank"">Britt Daniel</a>. Aside from his past collaborations with producer McCarthy, Daniel is also responsible for bringing A Giant Dog to the attention of Merge Records: the label that released much of Spoon’s most celebrated work. His croaky hangover baritone meshes well with Ellis and Cashen, and the track would be A Giant Dog at their most vulnerable, were the desire for personal intimacy not masked by the desire to get wasted. But beneath all of this nihilism is some real skilled songwriting that includes complex rhyme schemes, swaggering rhythms, and stunning harmonies. These qualities are perhaps strongest on <i>Pile</i>'s final track, ""Failing in Love,"" where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"" target=""_blank"">Ramones</a> guitars buzz and lock in with the drum stops and an improbable sax. The words, which seem to detail a divorce, are perhaps the clearest reason for the obsession with death, danger, and keeping affection at bay. ""I've tried and grown tired of failing in love,"" sing Ellis and Cashen, and it’s so simple and honest that you just want to get close to them, despite the band's countless cautions against doing so.</p></div>"|21887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21887-pile/|8.2|Pat Healy

While perusing the throngs of revelers from the safe distance of EDC's sponsored Snapchat feed, I was struck by the gigantic array of DJs spinning to vast seas of people, each act with their own specific, trademark gimmick. Swedish duo Dada Life throw huge inflatable bananas into the crowd. There's an artist named Marshmello who wears a giant white light-up square over his face. It seemed like elaborate costuming and props were almost a prerequisite, and while hordes of teens dance their worries away, watching them made me long for the old-school showmanship of rave and acid house—no less gimmicky, surely, but grittier, more sardonic, weirder. The last time I saw Irish house and techno producer Marcus Lambkin, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6175-shit-robot/"">Shit Robot</a>, perform, he too plugged in a crazy-looking LED helmet when he hit the stage, but it felt like a throwback to house's underground days, and not a ploy for more Instagram likes. He also proceeded to spin his homegrown brand of techno well into the night, striving to create that perfect, lost-in-abandon dancefloor moment—which he achieved, several times.</p>
<p>Shit Robot's third album, <i>What Follows</i>, also tries to recreate that experience, and while it's not always on the mark, it manages to deliver an enjoyable hour-long headtrip.  As on his previous LPs, Shit Robot makes impeccable use of his label mates: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7725-alexis-taylor/"">Alexis Taylor</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29318-nancy-whang-of-lcd-soundsystem/"">Nancy Whang</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31802-museum-of-love/"">Museum of Love</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2244-the-juan-maclean/"">the Juan Maclean</a> all lend their talents, and their camaraderie with Lambkin is evident. On opener “In Love,” Taylor's lilting vocals come in and out of the mix, soaked in piercing 808 synths and stuttering bass sequencers, while Lambkin's production sets the tone for the record: one, big giant swell from start to finish. </p>
<p>The lead single on<i> What Follows</i> is “Lose Control”, cowritten with Nancy Whang and Juan Maclean, where Whang speak-sings a icy directive: “I can't fight this feeling/Lose control.” The song makes good use of Shit Robot's dash of humor, the place where his appreciation of '80s and '90s rave culture comes through the most. It's a theme further explored in “Is There No End,” a rambling five minutes of shuffling techno where a spoken-word vocal describes a man's stream-of-consciousness journey to the club, only to get kicked out at the party's peak. It's like an exact counter to the surly doorman in Kick Like A Mule's 1992 acid house classic “The Bouncer,” but recast as the druggy clubber trying his best to follow the music to its peak. </p>
<p>That peak, the climax forever chased by ravers everywhere, never really comes to fruition on <i>What Follows</i>, with a majority of the album blending into one never-ending rise that doesn't quite launch itself over the edge. It's certainly purposeful, but nonetheless it lacks for something meatier, for the sonic equivalent of a huge green robot face lighting up the sweaty night. With DFA intricately woven into his DNA and a near lifetime of ironclad production skills, Shit Robot will no doubt continue honing his sound, inching ever closer to that perfect, life-changing beat.</p></div>"|21919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21919-what-follows/|6.7|Cameron Cook

He was finally positioning himself as a rapper to be reckoned with from a mainstream podium, but he was also delving deep into Christian ideology, with allusions to Noah's Ark and Lot's wife, with his ""foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That verse rolled out the red carpet for Kanye's long-awaited album, but it doubled as an announcement of Chance's new </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coloring Book </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(then given the working title </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chance 3</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">)</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> which may very well be the most eagerly-anticipated hip-hop project this year that doesn't come attached to an actual record label. West billed his album as ""a gospel album with a whole lot of cursing on it,"" but </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Life of Pablo</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> wasn't that; it was a rap album with some gospel overtures. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coloring Book</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, however, fits the billing, packing in so much gospel verve that it sounds like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-EhvSlHyZg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hezekiah Walker &amp; the Love Fellowship Crusade Choir </a>are going to drop into half the tracks and recite 1 Timothy 4:12 in chorale.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thematically, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coloring Book </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is a far cry from Chance's previous efforts. His debut mixtape, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">10 Day</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> was a small, heavy-lidded odyssey of being suspended from high school ""for chiefin' a hundred blunts;"" his breakthrough, 2013's dilated <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18105-chance-the-rapper-acid-rap/"">Acid Rap</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> contained songs about being a ""Chain Smoker"" and confessions of ""cigarettes on cigarettes/My momma think I stank/I got burn-holes in my hoodies."" But here, on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coloring Book</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Chancelor Bennett observes that ""we don't do the same drugs no more"" over acoustic piano and choristers backing his sentiments. He says</span><a href=""https://twitter.com/chancetherapper/status/731262639888830464"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the song is not about drugs</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, but it still comes off as a sobering admission from a rapper who once dedicated a small travelogue to</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoWL9JkBhKA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">taking acid south of the U.S. border</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Music is all we got,"" Chance professes on ""All We Got,"" the inaugural number featuring the Chicago Children's Choir and West returning the ""Ultralight Beam"" favor—but it's clear from the outset that this is Chance's show. His vocals—elastic and taut, all jerky grace, full of word-sound collages that hearken back to his spoken-word genealogy— are now almost fully dedicated to God and being high on life. ""I get my Word from the sermon/I do not talk to the serpent/That's a holistic discernment,"" he raps before threatening to ""give Satan a swirly."" Although his puerility remains intact, his fervor is amplified as never before.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18249-chance-the-rapper-blessings/"">Blessings</a>,"" poet-activist-singer-songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33738-jamila-woods/"">Jamila Woods</a> comes through with the hook: ""I'm gon' praise Him/Praise Him 'til I'm gone,"" while Chance drops sanctified tweetables: ""I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom/Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom"" and ""Jesus' black life ain't matter/I know, I talk to his daddy."" He also manages to mix in heavenly faith,  the joy of fatherhood, and redemption in a couplet and a half: ""I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions/Like my ex-girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything/I'm at war with my wrongs."" It's a heavy message delivered lightly, with tongue aflame.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coloring Book</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is not all about transcendence, however. Despite asking ""when did you start to forget how to fly?,"" Chance still has his feet firmly planted as one of the biggest independent rappers of the moment. On ""No Problem"" he raps, ""If one more label try to stop me/It's gon' be some dread-head n-ggas in your lobby."" (In a sublime stroke, the song features Lil Wayne, stretching and compacting his flow to approximate Chance's delivery while speaking on his own ongoing contractual issues with Cash Money Records.) ""Mixtape"" features Young Thug and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33587-lil-yachty/"">Lil Yachty</a>—two rappers who have found growing success by upending traditional music industry norms like Chance—to speak on their outsider stances. Thug doesn't get specific enough to make the song as heavy as it might have been, but Yachty's verse is strong (""Time and time again they told me no/They told me I wouldn't go…/Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper/Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater/Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer"") and helps the hook shine through: ""Am I the only one who still cares about mixtapes?"" (It's worth noting that Chance, who has never released a project for sale before, also</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/60521-chance-the-rapper-and-lil-b-release-free-based-freestyles-mixtape/""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">released a real-time mixtape last year with fellow outlier Lil B.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The bars here are so hard that it ain't one gosh-darned part you can't tweet, but the tracks carry their weight like their brother's keeper. ""Summer Friends"" hisses with soft humidity;  ""Juke Jam"" is the soundtrack to a candle-lit bedroom; ""All Night"" moves its feet to Chicago house, courtesy of a roller-rink jam from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31672-kaytranada/"">Kaytranada</a>. But the bulk of this record is handled by musical ensemble the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32988-donnie-trumpet-the-social-experiment/"">Social Experiment</a>. They're Chance's trusted collaborators—together they released last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20664-surf/"">Surf</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, spearheaded by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32978-donnie-trumpet/"">Donnie Trumpet</a></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">—</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and they've been refining a sound of expansive but intimate live jazz-indebted soul for the past few years.

<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coloring Book</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is one of the strongest rap albums released this year, and is destined to be on year-end lists aplenty. It's a more rewarding listen than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>'s recently released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21836-drake-views/"">VIEWS</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">; it's nearly as adventurous as </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Life of Pablo.</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> In execution and focus, it comes as a joyful, praise-dancing rejoinder to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/"">To Pimp a Butterfly</a></i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It feels a bit silly to compare </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coloring Book</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Butterfly</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, but it feels even sillier not to. When music comes like this—personal and panoramic, full of conversations with God, defying hip-hop norms while respecting them, proving that the genre can still dig deeper into its roots—it needs to be contextualized as what it is. This is an ultralight beam; it's a God dream.</span></p>

But on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Full of It</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Summer Cannibals toughen up their assault and hark back to the heavy scene that the Pacific Northwest punks killed off in the late 1980s. Their wailing riff-o-rama, double-tracked guitars, and sharp arpeggios soundtrack Boudreaux's frustrations with a dead-end relationship, wielding (and subverting) machismo rock tropes against a domineering, unavailable guy.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On paper, a lot of Boudreaux's lyrics can seem strangely submissive, pleading for validation and putting her faith in a union that she knows is doomed. “You turn a blind eye to my every appeal,” she sings on “I Wanna Believe.” “You make me feel like nothing matters but I still see your face/It makes me weak.” Her sneering delivery, though, is a self-aware send-up of this piteous-yet-sometimes-inevitable state, and the frustration that can accompany succumbing to such basic romance woes. She puts her anguish into wider context on the lumbering, cathartic closer “Simple Life,” questioning whether it's enough to want a “simple love and a simple home.” It's reminiscent of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30542-white-lung/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">White Lung</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, whose recent fourth album </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21849-paradise/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Paradise</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sounds like a hairier sibling to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Full of It</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and also finds Mish Way reconciling her punk background with her conventional desires.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The 11 songs on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Full of It</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> barely break the three-minute mark, and wed incendiary fretwork to bottom-end that rolls like a boulder down a marble run.

Summer Cannibals balance the abjection of their lyrics by playing like they're auditioning to ride the flame-belching rig in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mad Max: Fury Road</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p>Despite the ambiguity of some of her lyrics, Boudreaux's ire is rarely in dispute across these songs thanks to her bile-drenched delivery, though the moments where she makes it explicit are particularly good. “Talk Over Me” is full of coolly insolent, stinging riffs that accompany Boudreaux telling some paternalistic ass where to get off: “I'm not gonna let you talk over me one more time, and I'm not gonna wait for someone else to say that I'm right.” That self-assurance is why <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Full of It</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> works: Boudreaux can sing from a position of weakness thanks to Summer Cannibals' palpable confidence. On the title track, which kicks back at the music press, she makes perfectly clear that her sense of self doesn't hinge on anyone else's approval: “Tell me my worth, I'll tell you my pitch,” Boudreaux drawls, before scoffing: “Another lie, yeah, another unreachable itch.” </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Full of It</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> may not sound like classic Kill Rock Stars fare, but in these complex negotiations of power—both emotional and musical—they both fit right in and offer a smart update to their history.</span></p></div>"|21700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21700-full-of-it/|7.2|Laura Snapes

Dutch artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33594-jameszoo/"">Jameszoo</a>, aka Mitchel Van Dinther, calls his debut album <i>Fool</i> a collection of “naive, computer jazz,"" but while he may be untrained as a performer of jazz, he’s no <i>naif</i> as an artist, establishing himself clearly in the tradition of creative, mischievous tinkerers who sometimes hide behind the tag of “naive” as a means of avoiding heavier scrutiny.</span></p>

It’s clear from first listen that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fool</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> too is without doubt an “out there” disc, both in the most literal and clichéd ideas of the term. Not only does the record burst at the seams with ideas, but nearly each song does so, with each of the free-flowing tracks careening internally from moments of austere beauty to jazzy breakdowns, to burbling bleeps and blaps and even Pierre Boulez-style musique concrete. It’s a lot of ideas and sounds to cram into a 43 minute record in general, made only a little bit easier to digest by the fact that there are hardly discernible pauses between most of the eleven tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite the clutter, there are a number of moments on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fool</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> where everything clicks, in particular the album’s bookends. Opener “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18103-jameszoo-flake/"">Flake</a>” begins with traditional IDM electronic/synth tones that belie the rest of the record’s feel, before falling away to a startling hybrid of G-Funk and chiptune. The beautiful noise here hearkens back to some of the more effervescent and fun experimental electronic music of the late '90s and early 2000 (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3336-plone/"">Plone</a> and early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2475-jamie-lidell/"">Jamie Lidell</a> in particular come to mind). Closer “Teeth” starts slowly from a lovely interplay of reverbed organ and bass underneath some creaking metal sounds and a soaring violin, before building to a sort of tiny toy orgasm, similar to (but shorter and humbler than) the climax of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>’s “Contact” from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/"">Random Access Memories</a></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">—</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and all in two-and-a-half minutes. It's the most focused track on the record, and perhaps not coincidentally the shortest.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are other great moments on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fool</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as well, though Van Dinther’s haphazard compositional style  means the record seesaws frequently from the sublime to the mundane, and vice versa. “Lose” follows the killer “Flake” intro but loses its momentum with what sounds like a synthetic orchestra tuning up. However after two-and-a-half minutes of dithering, the noise suddenly builds and breaks way to a gorgeous and alluring melody. The synths continue bleating but the melodic underpinnings take what were tedious sounds and turn it all into something worth remembering. Penultimate number “Toots” is structured similarly, with a warm church organ penetrating 3 minutes in, turning unfocused chirps into something powerful and direct.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two other tracks of note on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fool</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> feature noteworthy albeit obscure guests: “The Zoo,” featuring undersung '70s jazzbo Steve Kuhn and “Flu” featuring Brazilian bossa nova player Arthur Verocai. The former is a bit of a </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIibl0rXlJc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take 2 on Kuhn’s original “Pearlie’s Swine”</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> from his 1971 self-titled record, featuring a similar musical approach and with Kuhn repeating some of the spoke-sung lyrics from that song. Despite a nice and very <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a>-esque electric cello intro, “The Zoo” is one of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fool</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s most straight-forward jazz tracks, with some lovely vibraphones and mellifluous bass from Brainfeeder staple artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a>. But for this reason it’s also less experimental, and comes off as a lesser version of the jazz which it apes. And unlike “Zoo,” which channels Kuhn directly, “Flu” seems like another Jameszoo fusion except two brief and pretty 20 second bursts of Verocai’s samba guitar in the middle of the song. But after each of the 20 second parts, the guitar disappears and the fusion returns, making Verocai’s contributions seem to be swallowed up by the earth.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jameszoo's work is strongest when he tones down the overt jazz and instead parses the genre for specific sounds and ideas to embellish his electronic experimentations. It’s easy to imagine how a creative, introspective artist like Van Dinther might be able to harness his ample curiosity and ability in the future, but for now, a lack of focus keeps him grounded. Hopefully next time he gets there.</span></p></div>"|21911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21911-fool/|6.9|Benjamin Scheim

The Russian outfit has been living on borrowed time since 2007, when four lifelong music nerds from Saint Petersburg decided to start a band, knowing full well that they’d have to part ways in a few months’ time to attend university. Determined to defy those temporal restraints, the quartet worked in fits and bursts, using every pocket of free time as a chance to commit their memories to wax. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Somehow, they've found ways to develop as a band even with this scattershot work schedule. Just this February, Pinkshinyultrablast released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21453-grandfeathered/"">Grandfeathered</a></i>, an underrated collection of sophisticated—and thunderous—pop songs. Several months after the band's most intricate release to date, London’s Club AC30 is taking a look back on their hurried early period with a reissue of <i>Happy Songs for Happy Zombies, </i>their debut EP. Frequently pointed to as an underrated gem by the modern shoegaze faithful, the four-track, 15-minute collection provides an enjoyable (if brief) introduction to the band’s rapturous take on rock.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Much like the Astrobrite album that inspired Pinkshinyultrablast's name, <i>Happy Songs for Happy Zombies </i>plays it maximalist. The aptly titled opening salvo “Blaster” spills forth in a rush of massive, fanning guitar riffs, whirring feedback, and bass throb. Guitarist Roman Parinov may not sing lead—that job belongs to frontwoman Lyubov Soloveva—but his screechy axe is the track’s strongest voice, easily engulfing her fragile melodies. Soloveva can’t be contained, however—just as Parinov seems to have her buried on “Blaster” or “Ode to Godzilla,” she phases through him, gently guiding the roar beneath her and preventing the music from dissolving into chaos.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Soloveva, Parinov, and company certainly take cues from amp-stackers like My Bloody Valentine and Swervedriver, but their biggest inspiration on <i>Happy Songs for Happy Zombies </i>arguably isn’t shoegaze, or even musical. In a 2015 interview with <i>Indie is Not A Genre</i>, Soloveva revealed the group’s fascination with the Russian custom of <i>dacha</i>: an annual exodus from city apartment to country cabin for a few months of hard-earned rest and reflection. The burbling “Honeybee,” certainly feels like the type of song inspired by a day of cloud-gazing; it sees Parinov loosening up and letting the notes unspool steadily atop a fluttering backbeat. Between the lurching, grunge-y verses on “Deerland” and “Blaster”’s aforementioned wind-tunnel arrangement, calling <i>Happy Songs for Happy Zombies </i>a relaxed effort is certainly a stretch, but the EP's <i>dacha </i>mentality endures: freedom, playfulness, childlike wonder—and most importantly, an appreciation of those rare moments where you’re not chasing time or fretting over its passage, but enjoying the time you <i>do </i>have with the people who matter. Fifteen minutes is no eternity, after all, but it’s ample time for an enjoyable escape—just like <i>Happy Songs for Happy Zombies</i>.</p></div>"|21869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21869-happy-songs-for-happy-zombies/|6.9|Zoe Camp

<p>Even within those periods there are fascinating mini-chapters, like his work from the early 1950s. Now, on the occasion of what would’ve been Miles Davis’ 90<sup>th</sup> birthday this month, comes <i>The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection</i>, a sometimes-disorienting, ultimately sumptuous set of eleven vinyl records from 1951–54, nine of which feature Miles as the sole leader.</p>
<p>The bulk of Miles Davis’ canonical output is on Columbia Records, which he left in 1986 for Warner Brothers in his final years. His pre-Columbia work from 1951–56 was, for the most part, on Prestige Records, a small, fledgling indie label in Hell’s Kitchen launched by Bob Weinstock in 1949. This set is not a comprehensive examination of his stay at Prestige—that is available on the 8-CD <i>Miles Davis Chronicle: The Complete Prestige Recordings, 1951–1956</i>—nor is there any new material here, but the recordings are in the exact format of their release, the forgotten 10-inch vinyl record, something new at the time that could accommodate more minutes than 78 rpm discs, which were the common format for popular recordings. “I was excited about the freedom this new technology would give me,” Miles wrote in his autobiography. “I had gotten tired of that three-minute lockstep that the 78s had put musicians in.”</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the 10-inch format, you’ll have to stay on your toes, as sides rarely go beyond 12 or 13 minutes (and sometimes run for as little as 8 minutes.) The set is in chronological order, more or less, to show how his work progressed, and features the original cover art, complete with typographical errors. (A 7–by–10 replica of one of Miles Davis’ paintings is also included.)</p>
<p>The music, too, will keep you on your toes, and enthralled. In many ways, this is one of his most rollicking periods. It’s post-Bird, post-birth-of-cool (released by Capitol Records), yet pre-great quintet with John Coltrane, which coalesced at Prestige in 1955 (not included in this set) and progressed into super-stardom at Columbia. Miles is still very much trying to find himself, musically and personally. A few of the musicians he organized for what several years later was called <i>Birth of The Cool</i>—white musicians, it should be said— took it to the West Coast and ran with it. Meanwhile, he was battling heroin addiction. “Heroin,” he wrote in his autobiography, “was my girlfriend.”</p>
<p><i>The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection </i>is a document then of a search, an exhilarating one: a search for self, a search for a sound, a search for an aesthetic, a search for like minds. His various band mates on these dates include: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33650-sonny-rollins/"">Sonny Rollins</a>, Art Blakey, Jackie McLean, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13106-charles-mingus/"">Charles Mingus</a>, John Lewis, Max Roach, Lucky Thompson, Roy Haynes, Horace Silver, Milt Jackson, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2813-thelonious-monk/"">Thelonious Monk</a>, and Zoot Sims, whom, according to Miles’ autobiography, he did heroin with right before they recorded <i>Miles Davis Plays the Compositions of Al Cohn</i> in January 1953, on LP 4. It is—maybe because of the drugs, maybe because it wasn’t Miles’ idea to play Cohn’s music—one of the rare uninspired records here. So is the first, <i>Modern Jazz Trumpets, </i>of which Miles is only one of four leaders, along with Fats Navarro, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1721-dizzy-gillespie/"">Dizzy Gillespie</a>, and the forever under-appreciated Kenny Dorham, highlighted on the cover as “Kinny.” (Remember, typos preserved.)</p>
<p>The rest—before H and after H—is nearly always stirring. Of that first recording, even Miles admitted he wasn’t up to par:<i> </i>“I didn’t play well,” Davis wrote of that January 1951 session, “but I think everyone else played well—especially Sonny [Rollins].” Indeed, Miles and Sonny had something special, and they have three dates together on this set across four of the LPs. As exceptional as some of the talent Miles assembled is, it didn’t always produce memorable partnerships. Charles Mingus, who plays piano on one tune—and he was a good piano player, just listen to <i>Mingus Plays Piano</i>—was never a going to be good fit with Miles. They both had huge personalities. And although he and Thelonious Monk <i>did</i> mesh well together, and played beautifully on four of these LPs, they clashed personally.  </p>
<p>By around 1954, Miles wrote that he’d hoped to form a steady touring band with Rollins, Horace Silver on piano, Kenny Clarke on drums, and Percy Heath on bass. It wasn’t meant to be: Rollins had to deal with his own drug issues; Silver joined Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers; and Clarke went to the Modern Jazz Quartet. That great-quartet-that-never-was did have one session, on the LP <i>Miles Davis with Sonny Rollins</i> from June 29, 1954. The results hover around perfection as they play the Rollins originals “Oleo,” “Airegin,” “Doxy,” and the Gershwin standard “But Not for Me.”</p>
<p>Miles kicked his heroin habit by 1954 and had a great year, all of which is included in this set, and almost all of his sessions were now recorded at Rudy Van Gelder’s across the river in New Jersey (though in his Hackensack living room, before he built his fabled studio in Englewood Cliffs). The following year, he did settle on a band, but with another tenor, John Coltrane, a 20-year-old bassist named Paul Chambers, Red Garland on piano, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. Not so bad. That quintet would go on to have recording dates for Prestige in 1955 and '56, which became the four albums <i>Cookin’</i>, <i>Steamin’</i>, <i>Relaxin’</i>, and <i>Workin’, </i>though now on 12-inch vinyl as the industry transitioned yet again by the mid-'50s.</p>
<p><i>The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection</i> can, however, be a little puzzling. If you have a collection of Miles Davis records and want to know if you already own some of this material, it might not be immediately clear. Many fans might own a previous version of, say, <i>Walkin’,</i> which on the cover says “Miles Davis All Stars.” But here, “Walkin’ ” appears not as an LP but merely as a tune—a phenomenal 13-minute version with the superlative tenorist Lucky Thompson—from the April 29, 1954 LP <i>Miles Davis All Star Sextet</i>. Nor is it spelled out that <i>Walkin’</i> (the 12-inch version, released by Prestige in 1957) is a compilation of two of the 10-inch LPs—<i>Miles Davis Quintet </i>in addition to<i> Miles Davis All Star Sextet</i>—plus one song not on this set. It all gets a little eye-crossing. You can figure most of this out, eventually, flipping back-and-forth from the 12-inch or CD you own (if you do) and the enclosed booklet. It is either maddening or a little fun, depending on your disposition—the fan as archivist. </p>
<p> <i>The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection</i> even rewards when you least expect it, like in 1951’s Lee Konitz Featuring Miles Davis, one of the few times, besides with Bird, where Miles was a sideman. (Cannonball Adderley’s 1958 Blue Note album <i>Somethin’ Else</i> was another, a record so luminous Uniqlo made a T-shirt out of it.) They were colleagues from <i>Birth of the Cool,</i> and Miles liked his playing, even defended him when he was criticized by other black musicians for hiring a white saxophonist. Konitz, the proto avant-gardist who was the first musician to record for Prestige in '49, worked hard—like Miles—to never sound like anyone else, and the two are almost otherworldly here, drifting inquisitively around each other, then as one, as if it were the birth of the free-cool. The daring hints at what would come, for Konitz (still underrated and still playing challenging music at age 88), and for Miles, always prepared to risk, always willing to move beyond his comfort zone. To hear Miles Davis develop—as a person, as a musician, and as a bandleader, in the midst of technological changes—makes this series of recordings on Prestige specialized, yes, but also quite special. </p></div>"|21918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21918-the-complete-prestige-10-inch-lp-collection/|8.4|Michael J.

Their extracurricular candor is a necessary complement to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holy Ghost,</span></i> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">which</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">asks for difficult things out of its audience—space, patience and acceptance. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the past, MoBo’s appeal often lied in how they looked like guys who came to their shows straight from a Drexel lecture hall, singing about things that happened to them just that day. On </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holy Ghost</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Ewald and Lukens admit that even a wholly unpretentious, image-free band like Modern Baseball might have to put on an act sometimes just to make it to the next gig. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The glare from our stupid, spineless words just whining, every fucking day/what do I really want to say?,” Ewald spews on “Note to Self,” one of the many road-weary tracks here. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Throughout </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holy Ghost,</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Lukens and Ewald mostly want to say “I miss you,” “I love you,” or, “I’m sorry.” </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But with their friends, family and Philly often hundreds of miles away, Modern Baseball either internalize or end up directing their anxieties at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There was a point where it was unclear whether Modern Baseball would make it to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holy</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><i> Ghost</i>,</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and the tension is audaciously presented in a <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11796-speakerboxxxthe-love-below/"">Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-style</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">split condensed into less than a half hour. Ewald is given the first six tracks, while the remaining five are Lukens’. Even up to last year’s excellent <a href=""https://modernbaseballpa.bandcamp.com/album/mobo-presents-the-perfect-cast-ep-featuring-modern-baseball"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>MOBO Presents:</i> </a></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://modernbaseballpa.bandcamp.com/album/mobo-presents-the-perfect-cast-ep-featuring-modern-baseball"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Perfect Cast EP featuring Modern Baseball</a>, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">new</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">listeners could be forgiven thinking the band only had one singer. At this point, Ewald and Lukens seem like total inverses of each other.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holy Ghost </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">will inevitably take on a new life as its lyrics become status updates. All the zingers will be Ewald’s, but since his hooks are as densely worded and occasionally unwieldy as his verses, the shoutalongs come from Lukens. Ewald’s side builds towards “Everyday” and “Hiding,” the most compositionally complex and ornately arranged Modern Baseball songs to date. Lukens, meanwhile, claims he wrote all of his lyrics in the last three days of recording. His songs are urgent, frenzied and compact, with titles that read like inside jokes used as placeholders (“Breathing in Stereo,” “Coding These To Lukens,"" “Apple Cider, I Don’t Mind”).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The format serves each writer as an individual. While the shift towards tempered indie rock often robs </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holy Ghost </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">of the instant gratification of early MoBo, there isn’t a single clunker lyric that was wedged in for the sake of cleverness. Taken together, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holy Ghost </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feels inevitably unbalanced. Modern Baseball probably didn’t have much of a choice; shuffled in any way, it just becomes nonsensically disjointed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sequencing makes more sense upon hearing the closing “Just Another Face,” whose chorus alone more than makes up for any denied catharsis. Based on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Perfect Cast</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and their live <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers/"">Killers</a> covers, an album full of this kind of bombastic arena-emo would be certainly welcome. It consolidates every improvement over </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’re Gonna Miss It All</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: Ewald’s compositional ambition and patience, Lukens’ newly theatrical high range and for both, a desire to recognize the bittersweet way in which the relationship between them and their audience has changed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The self-pity of the verses are simply and petulantly worded to recall MoBo’s earlier phase and Lukens’ </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">real <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61296-modern-baseball-escape-high-school-cliches-in-rock-bottom-video/"">rock bottom</a></span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (“I’m a waste of time and space,” “entering a well-known phase, I scream ‘get lost, I hate everything’”). A number of people might be the voice talking to Lukens during the unabashedly uplifting chorus. Perhaps it’s his family, or Cam Boucher, the Sorority Noise frontman Lukens credits with pushing him to seek help.

But Kvelertak also embrace the let-the-good-times-roll side of metal as well. (For the record, the band </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/FkUItKUSlpY?t=1m17s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">describes itself</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> first and foremost as ""rock and roll."") And even though frontman Erlend Hjelvik sings entirely in Norwegian, Kvelertak's third album </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nattesferd</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is so thoroughly crammed with </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fist-pumping</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> hooks it's easy to get the impression that he's singing about </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFCY-241qtc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">heading out to the highway</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> the whole time.

<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nattesferd</span></i> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">actually</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> covers </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a lot </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">more ground than Kvelertak's '80s ancestors did, but elements that might otherwise oppose one another blend into the experience </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">seamlessly</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Kvelertak's </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fellow revivalists (the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1921-hellacopters/"">Hellacopters</a>, Bonded By Blood, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5766-the-sword/"">The Sword</a>, and pretty much any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Sabbath</a>-mimicking fuzz-rock band)</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">can be so adamant about faithful replication that listening to them can feel suffocating</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. By contrast, the overwhelming feeling that comes across with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nattesferd</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is one of freedom to explore. ""Svartmesse,"" for example, begins with a reverbed, single-string </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">choka-choka-choka</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> guitar line that's initially reminiscent of the </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lick It Up</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-era KISS tune ""Exciter"" until the song veers into a quintessential New Wave Of British Heavy Metal-style verse. It's hard to imagine such a move in anyone else's hands not falling into either complete camp or embarrassing over-earnestness. In this case, it's fun without making you laugh at—or even </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">with—</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the band.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The same is true of the production. Both Kvelertak's 2010 self-titled debut and 2013's sophomore album </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17815-kvelertak-meir/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meir</span></i></a> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">benefited from the touch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a> guitarist/producer Kurt Ballou, who, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">no surprise</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, captured the scratchy edges of the band's sound. This time, Kvelertak </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">chose</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to produce themselves along with engineer Nick Terry (The Libertines, Turbonegro, Robyn Hitchcock). </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By contrast, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nattesferd</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> hearkens back to a more vintage rock feel. Still, Terry and the band opt for a crisp, vibrant ambience rather than the boxed-in reverbs that were typical of the early '80s.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> The CD booklet includes lyrics, which of course won't be of much use for non-Norwegian speakers. But the text for each song is preceded by a cryptic thumbnail summary. Listeners shouldn't expect to get a feel for what the songs are actually about with introductions like ""Odin hangs himself from Yggdrasil for nine days so he can uncover the secrets of the world,"" ""A future of despair awaits us. Resistance is futile,"" and ""A traveler ventures into the strange black night with hopes of finding himself a new home."" (The album title means ""night traveler."") Alas, Google Translate won't help you determine that either, but with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nattesferd</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Kvelertak exploit an opportunity to create a sense of mystery. More importantly, they back it up with a group of songs that's virtually filler-free and loses little steam towards the end. Even if Kvelertak didn't mean to re-cast the Norse deity Odin as a Camaro-driving rebel burning rubber down the road, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nattesferd</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> makes it exceedingly easy—and enjoyable—to picture him as one.</span></p></div>"|21818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21818-nattesferd/|8.0|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

The Georgia post-punk band’s debut album, released in 2015 under the name Pinecones, was titled </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sings for You Now</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and it contained numerous lyrical references to the titular act; in essence, the album was an account of the band’s own creation, propelled by muscular hymns and steeped in a mystical if not downright metaphysical aura. If </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sings for You Now</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> was an origin story, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I Hear You</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a mission statement. Following a name change to Arbor Labor Union, the group has refined and expounded upon its throbbing, rootsy drone. They’ve also doubled down on singing about singing—if not always in the most convincing way.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Veterans of various punk and hardcore bands, the guys in Arbor Labor Union drew inspiration from Henry David Thoreau’s transcendentalist philosophy for </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sings for You Now</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and these two areas of inspiration still hold heavy sway over </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I Hear You</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. On the pounding “Radiant Mountain Road,” an uplifting command to “Ascend to the Mount of Joy” is fueled by nervy guitar interplay. Rather than trading or entwining leads, though, guitarists Brain Atoms and Bo Orr speak to each other in blocks of chord and texture. “Belief’d” is just as elemental, a hymn cast in circular, mutant-Southern-rock riffs and bleary distortion; at the same time, there’s an almost pagan spiritualism at play, a call to invest “in the occult whispers of shifting plates” and “the stacking of heads into a faceless totem” before adding—exclamation point theirs—“We believe in those things / Belief!”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If it sounds a bit on-the-nose, that directness is even more blatant on tracks like “Mr. Birdsong,” “Hello Transmission,” and “Volume Peaks.” Here Orr sings of being “fresh and green/And you’d always heard of song/But you would never sing”; of how “In a song I sang to you/That in a song it came to you”; and how “I live in a song/I dance when it’s played.” At points, this recursive amplification of the power of song is dizzying. Other times it comes across as forced, a clever idea filled beyond its capacity, or  a conceptual exercise that flies in the face of the music’s primal howl.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That howl, though, is considerable. Ironically, it’s also restricted mostly to the instruments. Orr’s vocals have developed only slightly since </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sings for You Now</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. His style and subject matter are so similar to that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2559-lungfish/"">Lungfish</a>’s Daniel Higgs, it's impossible not to compare the two—and in that match-up, Orr can’t come close in terms of depth, dimensionality, or sheer force of will. But even disregarding that, Orr’s delivery feels far too sleepy and easygoing when pitted against the enormity of the band, or even his own lyrics; even his occasional yelps of euphoria feel restrained. He’s most compelling on “IHU,” a shimmering, meditative chant that boils over into a call to action: “We trust our leader/We heed his word/We’ve studied joy / And it can be heard.” That joy can’t always be discerned throughout </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I Hear You</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, but Arbor Labor Union have taken a respectable leap toward realizing the throbbing cosmic Americana that clearly rings in their souls.</span></p></div>"|21784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21784-i-hear-you/|6.8|Jason Heller

But in Daniel Lee’s sly, sonorous vocals, you sensed an eccentric streak lurking, and he and bassist April Aliermo weren’t afraid to unleash it through other projects. Outside Hooded Fang, the two have betrayed a fondness for heaving hardcore (as Tonkapuma) and day-glo electro-pop (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30194-phedre/"">Phédre</a>), while Lee has flexed some Krautrockin’ funk in his solo Lee Paradise project. Meanwhile, Hooded Fang shed its keyboardists and brass section, and as its line-up got leaner, its sound has become progressively meaner.</p>
<p> Hooded Fang’s fourth album, <i>Venus on Edge</i>, represents the next step in an evolutionary process. The transformation began in earnest with 2011’s <i>Tosta Mista</i>, which scuffed up the band’s formative indie-pop sensibility with a Modern Lovers scrappiness. That aesthetic was pushed deeper into the red with the grotty garage rock of 2013’s <i>Gravez. </i>But <i>Venus on Edge</i> is even more weird and wired, marking the moment where Hooded Fang’s fantastical name ceases to be an ironic counterpoint to the band’s playful fuzz-pop and becomes a guiding principle.</p>
<p>The new record also turns a page on proto-punk completely in favor of weirder turf: industrialized dissonance, sci-fi surf-punk, and tweaked-out guitar frequencies that ring out like a biohazard lab activating the meltdown siren. Lee’s cool, conversational voice melds into the artfully mutated noise swirling around him, as he breaks down his melodies into staccato communiqués. </p>
<p>But as Hooded Fang’s music has grown wilder, their lyrical focus has become more concrete. <i>Venus on Edge</i> is another springtime release from a Toronto act presenting views from the 6, though, as Hooded Fang would tell you, any view view of that city is inevitably obstructed by <a href=""http://torontolife.com/city/stuck-in-condoland/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">friggin’ condos</a>. Where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> invokes Toronto as a visual and thematic backdrop, Hooded Fang treat the city as a target, a place where gentrification, smartphone dependency, and pandering lifestyle marketing have run amok: “Plastic Love” depicts big-business branding as an exercise in <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>-style mind control, complete with a wonderfully wiggy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"">B-52s</a>-style breakdown; “Glass Shadows” channels the dispiriting feeling of walking among the high-density, high-rise developments that loom ominously over city’s downtown core, with Lee darting around the song’s jabbing riff as if he were trying to avoid <a href=""http://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/07/17/falling_glass_closes_university_ave.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the panes of glass that frequently rain down from Toronto’s shoddily built towers</a>.</p>
<p>And while Toronto’s rich multiculturalism is an oft-advertised point of civic pride, Hooded Fang are nonetheless one of the few mixed-race bands in the city’s indie-rock scene, a circumstance that informs <i>Venus on Edge</i>’s most agitated tracks. Where the frantic “Impressions” spins an alien-visitation yarn to highlight the corrosive effects of xenophobia, the pin-pricked, new-waved rave-up “Shallow” sings of unchecked white privilege as a festering disease: “You’re no iconoclast/Blinded all your life by the paleness of your sight/It’s a sickness/You can’t see what’s going on.” The target of the song is unnamed, but it’s not a stretch to assume it’s directed at the band formerly known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32165-viet-cong/"">Viet Cong</a>, <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/music/article/8203not_yours_to_play_with_why_viet_congs_name_offends-hooded_fangs_april_aliermo_on_community_racism_appropriation_of_neighbours_culture"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">given the instrumental role Aliermo played</a> in mobilizing the protest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1110-why-viet-cong-have-changed-their-name-an-interview-with-frontman-matt-flegel/"">to get them to change their name</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of its 10 tracks, <i>Venus on Edge</i>’s warping effects do start to normalize somewhat, like when you stare into a funhouse mirror for an extended period and your eyes get used to the distended shapes. Even as its songs twist into new shapes, the dynamic between the band’s relentless racket and Lee’s casual tone never wavers, to the point where the transformation of the finale “Venus” from deconstructed blues dirge to high-speed sprint feels less dramatic than intended. But, on an album that’s about keeping your cool in the face of mounting frustration, perhaps that resolute stance is just a defense mechanism. With <i>Venus on Edge</i>, Hooded Fang are the stars of their own horror flick, playing the last surviving rational humans in a city overrun with mind-numbed, inconsiderate, glass-eyed drones. And like all good scary movies, there’s a plot twist: this one’s actually a documentary.</p></div>"|21862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21862-venus-on-edge/|7.3|Stuart Berman

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">More importantly, it’s an argument concerning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a>—not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4803-gram-parsons/"">Gram Parsons</a>, not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>, not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4576-paul-westerberg/"">Paul Westerberg</a>.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After all, a truly inconsolable song couldn’t possibly be given a title like “To Be Young (Is To Be Sad, Is To Be High).” On it, Adams appears more wise and empathetic than young and sad; note that it’s<i> </i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sung </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">in the past tense. Like so much of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heartbreaker, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">its focus isn’t misery, but nostalgia—its inclusion during the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUofjnTj8h8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">opening credits of </a></span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUofjnTj8h8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Old School</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a comedy suffused with longing for a simple forms of self-destructive behavior,</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">made its flexibility all the more apparent.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s a song that Adams plays at nearly every one of his shows, not to commiserate with the crowd, but to celebrate a past time when its linear logic made all the sense in the world. Think of it as Adams’ “Rubber Ring,” an open invitation to fondly remember that time when you relied on a fucked-up guy like him to save your life.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The introduction is an outlier, though—would <i>Heartbreaker</i> be held in the same regard if it was just wistful folk-rock like “My Winding Wheel?” Even though “AMY” outright names the supposed inspiration behind </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heartbreaker </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and is the most striking stylistic divergence from Whiskeytown</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(prior to the experimental </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pneumonia</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">), an album of weeping, floral psychedelia might have been too much, too soon. <a href=""https://twitter.com/theryanadams/status/322578220891402241"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Though Adams claims</a> that the titling of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heartbreaker </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">was a last-second decision made while staring at a <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/Heartbreaker_(single)_Mariah_Carey.png/220px-Heartbreaker_(single)_Mariah_Carey.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mariah Carey poster</a>, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heartbreaker </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is <i>Heartbreaker</i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">for the times it allows the listener sees themselves in its own album cover—prostrate, staring at the ceiling, half-hoping that cigarette drops onto their bed so they can feel something different.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despair alone never accounted for </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heartbreaker’</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">s unusual resonance. It isn’t the most dire or confessional account of bad romance; its language is not the most clever. There are all kinds of odd tangents, character is frequently broken, and it’s probably a few songs longer than it really needs to be. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heartbreaker </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">isn’t a tidy narrative or song cycle about relationships anyways; otherwise, how to explain the inclusion of the barroom brawl “Shakedown on 9th Street” or the Dylan goof “Damn Sam (I Love a Woman That Rains)?” Even “In My Time of Need” isn’t actually about </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ryan Adams’ </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">time of need and certainly inapplicable to a broken relationship between an up-and-coming rock star and a music publicist; it’s pretty much a Whiskeytown-style character study about rural financial distress (“I work these hands to bleed, cause I got mouths to feed/and I got $15 hid above the stove”).</span></p>
<p>No, the power of this album, and the reason it reminds its devotees too much of him, or her, or a past version of themselves, can be found in “Come Pick Me Up.” “Come Pick Me Up” is the that ends most of Adams' concerts these days and probably will for the rest of his career. On a basic level, it could slot alongside petulant, scorned-dude screeds like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVk_e31dnlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Song for the Dumped”</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co0tTeuUVhU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Heartless;”</a> it <i>is </i>about a woman who seemingly fucked him over. But the most important lyric isn’t the one about this is the kind of person who would steal your records and screw your friends without the slightest remorse. It’s “<i>I wish you would”—</i>the point of “Come Pick Me Up” is not to marvel at this person’s monstrosity and project it outwards. It’s to see yourself in Ryan Adams and remember every single time you’ve <i>allowed </i>yourself to get fucked over and even worse, sought it out.</p>
<p>In every repetition of “<i>I wish you would</i>,” Adams underlines not just the appeal of <i>Heartbreaker, </i>but most breakup albums in general. On some level, they make no evolutionary sense: life is hard enough, why would anyone be drawn to music that lets you relive your most miserable moments? Yeah, there’s jokes and asides and times where <i>Heartbreaker </i>rocks, but those defense mechanisms malfunction on “Call Me on Your Way Back Home” when Adams sings, “oh, I just wanna die without you” and it sure as hell sounds like the truth.</p>
<p>Maybe you <i>wanna </i>die. But you didn’t. And that’s OK. Like Morrissey, or really any singer-songwriter worth hearing on the topic, Adams doesn’t see the occasional heartbreak as a terminal fate, but an essential part of the human condition. In closing one of his performances captured on 2015’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20495-live-at-carnegie-hall/"">Live at Carnegie Hall</a></i><i>, </i>Adams yells, ""THAT’S IT! YOU’RE SAD NOW!!! NOW YOU’RE SAD!!! EVERYBODY’S SAD NOW! YEAAAAHHH!!!!""  Everyone gets the joke. “Come Pick Me Up” isn’t miserable; like <i>Heartbreaker, </i>it’s actually enjoyable knowing you can hit bottom for 50 minutes and still appreciate the view.  </p></div>"|21901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21901-heartbreaker-deluxe-reissue/|9.0|Ian Cohen

He was integral in grime’s early hustle during the halcyon pirate radio days, but the music he was making, from 2008-2012 was soulless, kowtowing to a sanitized version of grime that went hand in hand with the slow-burning corporate ransacking of the genre that started with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1096-dizzee-rascal/"">Dizzee Rascal</a>’s breakthrough almost a decade earlier. He recently <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/skepta-dj-semtex"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">compared</a> this dissatisfaction with his role in the mainstream with Britney Spears' infamous shaved head incident. If there is a similar meltdown for Skepta it happened in April of 2012, in a 26-minute video posted to Youtube, titled “</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jOnj9I14hc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">#UnderdogPsychosis no.1</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">” with a caption that read: “Break the cycle.” In a monologue by turns manic, vulnerable, self-aware, and inarticulate, he castigated himself, the system, (in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4873-dj-khaled/"">DJ Khaled</a>’s parlance the pervasive “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/64029-dj-khaled-explains-the-keys-to-success-reveals-who-they-are-on-the-ellen-degeneres-show/"">they</a>”), the industry, reflected on his forgotten and youthful musical past, and celebrated the life of the underdog. He promised to make music that had meaning. The video was later shown at the Tate Modern, a strange high watermark for the grime renaissance he helped ignite. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s been five years since a proper studio album from the 33-year-old Londoner, and after many delays his long-awaited</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Konnichiwa </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">has finally arrived. It is arguably the first appointment listen in a genre that has never been defined by albums, but by singles, loosies, hotly pressed riddims, and pirate radio broadcasts. This partly comes from an album roll out and rebranding that has lasted almost two years. Last April, he organized an impromptu rave in a Shoreditch car park attended by almost a thousand people via an Instagram post. He <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58614-kanye-west-performs-all-day-at-the-brit-awards/"">helped</a> hijack the stage of the Brits with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a> a month before. And even earlier than that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> had cribbed lines from Skepta’s “That’s Not Me” for “Used To” starting a cross-continental musical love affair, leading to Drake <a href=""http://djbooth.net/news/entry/2016-05-09-drake-not-signed-bbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">symbolically</a> signing to Skepta’s BBK label. He’s helped unfurl a ocean-spanning red carpet that’s led to wide ranging institutional support prompted magazine covers</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, documentaries</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and a litany of think pieces asking, yet again, if was America ready for grime. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sudden explosion of cultural cachet seems to have made no dents in his anarchic attitude. <i>Konnichiwa</i> is easily the most blatantly anti-authoritarian statement from rap this year, overflowing with sneering contempt for popular culture’s industry of image, the press, the police, and the government at large.  No matter the respect he’s garnered recently, and the friends he’s gained along the way<i>, Konnichiwa</i> proves that Skepta still bristles at the very idea of institutions. He is still flipping the bird, compelling you to help him burn it all down.  </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“That’s Not Me” was the first song Skepta released off <i>Konnichiwa</i>, and it’s a template for the album's tone: A combination of snarling bravado and earnest self directed criticism—an elegantly brutal volte-face from a previous life. He’s thrown his designer clothes in the garbage, donned his famous black track suit, and disavowed the trappings of the last few years (“I put it all in the bin cause that's not me”). He’s come back out of the thicket of a forced absence, full of self-aggrandizing swagger. (“It's the return of the mack/I'm still alive just like 2Pac”).  A year later, at the height of his return to prominence, the music video for the best song on this album,“Shutdown,” was released. Dressed in all white, in the middle of London’s bloated symbol of divisive gentrification the Barbican Centre, Skepta makes very clear that he fears no one: “Me and my Gs ain't scared of police/We don't listen to no politician/Everybody on the same mission/We don't care about your ‘isms and schisms,"" he rapped, lines that scan as both an indictment and a call-to-arms. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skepta produced eight of the twelve tracks himself, and they have the same roughly hewn power of his</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sVpRAllC4A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> early instrumentals</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, measured but fiery stews of dancehall, jungle, UK funky, and garage. When it works, it's bone-rattling stuff. Elsewhere, it's a mixed bag, sonically and qualitatively: He caricatures Noah “40” Shebib’s </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">rose-quartz </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">soul on “Ladies Hit Squad;” “Crime Riddim,” produced by Blaikie and Skepta’s brother Jason, has the wild flair of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"">Death Grips</a> track; and “Numbers” (featuring and co-produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a>) fails to shoehorn Skepta into Pharrell's bubbly funk universe. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As for his lyrics, there is nothing coded about them, or their meaning: He raps exclusively about distrust and independence. He’s very much aware that London, and the world, will continue to exploit him and erase his individuality. This awareness is why he refuses to appear in pictures with fans or answer press emails in “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18193-skepta-man/"">Man</a>.” It’s why he pulls way back, and samples Wiley’s call for peace in the middle of a battle (“Lyrics for lyrics, calm”) in “Lyrics.” He finds peace, if he finds it at all, in his roots: by  remaining loyal to family and friends, by being appreciative of the past, and by incubating a future for his genre. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Konnichiwa</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is as nakedly vulnerable Skepta has ever been, and it represents a tantalizingly wide-open door for grime. It’ll be our job as listeners to step through and discover what we’ve been missing. </span></p></div>"|21858.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21858-konnichiwa/|7.8|Kevin Lozano

It was a lovely scene, a strong sign of togetherness and femininity, set against a sunlit backdrop. It was the second single of Rae’s 2006 debut album, and one of the first times we saw the singer/guitarist, whose blend of soul music is equally weightless and captivating. Rae quickly became a star; in 2007, she was nominated for three Grammy awards and three Brit awards, and her debut record has sold four million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>Yet in 2008, Rae’s husband, Jason, died after an overdose of alcohol and methadone. It led to a creative hiatus and a moment of intense reflection. “For a huge period, I didn’t want to do anything,” Rae<a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/corinne-bailey-rae-i-didnt-want-to-do-anything-after-my-husband-died-1882248.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> told <i>The Independent</i> in 2010</a>. “It was like a barrenness which I’d never experienced; this sense of time just stretching and stretching and not having anything to put into it all.” As a result, Rae’s follow-up album—<i>The Sea</i>—felt sullen, full of edgy sounds expressing loss and despair. That was six years ago.</p>
<p>Following yet another hiatus from music, Rae is back with a new album and a lush new sound. The vibe is far more colorful than anything she’s done previously, and her collaborators—KING, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33494-esperanza-spalding/"">Esperanza Spalding</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32932-moses-sumney/"">Moses Sumney</a> and others—set a high bar for unique alternative art. <i>The Heart Speaks in Whispers</i> was partially recorded in Los Angeles where, according to<a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7348464/corinne-bailey-rae-the-heart-speaks-in-whispers-new-sound-overcoming-heartbreak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Billboard</a>, Rae fell in love with its black Bohemian alternative scene. “All these musicians know each other and hang out,” she told them. “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a>, J Davey,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/""> Flying Lotus</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32915-kamasi-washington/""> Kamasi Washington</a>—all the people who circle around<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/""> Kendrick Lamar</a>...I felt like I was in heaven.” You hear those influences throughout, especially on songs “Been to the Moon,” “Green Aphrodisiac,” “Horse Print Dress,” and “Taken by Dreams,” gentle pop/R&amp;B hybrids with a California sheen. Aided by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33372-king/"">KING</a> members Paris and Amber Strother, who collaborated on parts of this album, you hear vestiges of their sound on “Tell Me,” a cavernous pop jam worthy of the group’s own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21469-we-are-king/"">stellar LP</a>. Spalding, who also released a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21575-emilys-devolution/"">great record</a> this year, sings background on “Green Aphrodisiac,” and Sumney lends his golden voice to “Caramel.” While this is Rae’s album, <i>Heart</i> feels like a group effort in that regard, like the result of several jam sessions set by the crew’s collective energy.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>The Sea</i>, with its dark themes and heavy rhythms, <i>Heart</i> offers broader emotional range, and Rae seems at peace with her life and newfound direction. The mood feels wide open, centered on spacious grooves, and the lyrics seem lifted from Rae’s diary, a heart-fluttering prose that lands softly on your ear. She sings about dreams, of walking through figurative darkness in search of brighter days. “Hey, I Won’t Break Your Heart,” a meditative ballad near the album’s beginning, speaks of summertime romance and the cautious optimism of a new relationship. <i>Heart</i> represents the best of Rae’s first two albums, connecting the understated charm of her debut with <i>The Sea</i>’s pensive tone. It makes for a fascinating listen, one filled with catharsis and inspiration. Rae doesn’t directly mention her past struggles, but her light permeates this record, leaving a shining example of strength and perseverance.</p></div>"|21900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21900-corinne-bailey-rae-the-heart-speaks-in-whispers/|7.6|Marcus J.

Domestic bliss was a lens twist for Geldof, who until then had been a notorious indie socialite—imagine Paris Hilton rewritten by Diablo Cody. And even more so for Cohen: A year earlier, he had been fronting serious post-punk teens <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29696-scum/"">S.C.U.M.</a>, who were named for Valerie Solanas' manifesto, and cited the likes of avant-garde Japanese band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5660-les-rallizes-denudes/"">Les Rallizes Dénudés</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13692-pharoah-sanders/"">Pharoah Sanders</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a> as influences. They signed to Mute, and were feted by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a>. You can't buy that kind of credibility—or sustain it once you're pictured next to a photo splash of Prince William and Kate Middleton's ""night of glamor and tears.""</p>
<p>This wasn't how things were meant to go. S.C.U.M. split, presumably as a result of Cohen's new celebrity life, and he decided to pursue a solo career, writing about the strangeness of being a young father of two in a British rock dynasty. But the script wrinkled again when Geldof was found dead at 25, the result of a fatal heroin overdose. After a few understandably lost months, Cohen got back to writing, and finished his record, which unfolds in chronological order. All things considered, <i>Bloom Forever</i> (the middle names of their second son, Phaedra) is unexpectedly upbeat: a '70s singer/songwriter record indebted to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7104-elton-john/"">Elton John</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>'s <i>Berlin</i>.</p>
<p>Mostly recorded in Iceland, the arrangements are at once utterly relaxed yet over-the-top. (If you can't temper a story of being widowed at 23 with a little absurdity, when can you?) But like Cardinal's Eric Matthews, Cohen strikes a fine balance between sweet wooziness and cathartic guitar/saxophone/flute soloing. Where <i>Bloom Forever</i> could easily—and justifiably—have been dark and oppressive, instead, it's filled with inviting warmth and light, and sharpened by Cohen's reedy, Byronesque tone.</p>
<p>In contrast to the music's opulent wallowing, Cohen's plainspoken lyrics initially evoke the closed idyll of a new, young family unit. ""As the rivers make their beds, our love will be holding onto each other,"" he vows in opener ""Honeymoon,"" where smoky, drifting guitar and languid sax ride to a storming climax. On the title track, about Phaedra's birth, he evokes their ""lonely weather,"" new parenthood's sweet and tiring fug. ""Let's find a place to hide/One where we'll never sigh,"" he sings, over loose guitar that recalls the relaxed stateliness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17618-push-the-sky-away/"">Push the Sky Away</a></i>. It's a really lovely space to spend time in—so much so that it's hard to begrudge him ""Hazy Shades,"" a sunny and shameless rip-off of America's ""A Horse With No Name"" coupled with the lyrics to Neil Young's ""Love and Only Love.""</p>
<p>Traces of that Americana lilt make it into ""Country Home,"" the one song on <i>Bloom Forever</i> that deals most directly with Geldof's death. Although the lyrics are brutal (""My love had gone, she'd turned so cold/Why weren't her eyes covered and closed?""), it's remarkably measured, cascading on waves of pedal steel and vocal harmonies. Cohen has obviously had to grow up incredibly fast, but even so, the sophistication of the writing, and his resolve within those songs, is pretty extraordinary. His children give him reason to keep going on ""Ain't Gonna Be No Rain,"" and the rollicking sea shanty feel (and flute solo!) of ""New Morning Comes” evokes the ""sun still shining on, even though it's cold.""</p>
<p>""Only Us"" is a cavernous, Pink Floyd-indebted piano lament for the intimacy the couple once shared, but on ""Mother Mary,"" Cohen promises to keep everything he's lost inside of him. ""I will hold onto the part of me that is in love with you,"" he sings softly, as graceful as the silvery strings and gentle piano. Without warning, his voice expands, and the song storms to another never-ending crescendo, buzzing and burning like a rocket burning off layers as it breaches the atmosphere. The blurry quality that characterized the record's first half is gone, the focus sharper; the end of a very strange dream. Cohen will never be able to escape the context surrounding <i>Bloom Forever</i>, but he refuses to let himself be defined by tragedy. His bold, distinctive debut album stands a million miles from the celebrity circus, and will endure far longer than mawkish titillation.</p></div>"|21877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21877-bloom-forever/|7.9|Laura Snapes

Kay, whose real name is Louis Kevin Celestin, moved from Haiti to Canada with his family when he was an infant, and his father retains a strong sense of national pride. When Kaytranada plays his dad a song from his debut album, <i>99.9%, </i>the music sparks a rush of patriotic excitement. “Now I understand that he didn’t forget Haiti!” his father exclaims. “You can feel it!”</p>
<p>It’s possible to guess at the characteristics Kay’s father had in mind. Among Haitian music’s distinct features is an insistent focus on complex rhythms, many of them imported from African music and Dominican merengue, as well as a more general willingness to incorporate various countries’ homegrown styles into a cohesive whole. The genre-defying stew of funk, soul, R&amp;B, and beat and dance music that Kaytranada has cooked up on <i>99.9%</i> nods back at that heritage of percussion-driven synthesis.</p>
<p>Kay first made his name as a Soundcloud standout and dance DJ, but he has the mentality of a musico-archaeologist, digging past yesterday’s obvious pop gems to unearth the overlooked. In its sonic diversity, his album is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>’s crate-digging dynamism, but unlike a lot of instrumental hip-hop (or the house artists he’s sometimes grouped with), Kay’s beats are not at all rigid or predictable. His drums are configured strangely, bending, shifting, doubling back. With those rhythms, and his own custom-made synths, the 23-year-old shows himself to be a strong-willed studio auteur on a mix of instrumental and lyric-based tracks.</p>
<p>Several standout drummers were recruited for the record, including Karriem Riggins and Alexander Sowinski of the Toronto jazz outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32603-badbadnotgood/"">BADBADNOTGOOD</a>, but even the tracks that don’t feature a guest percussionist are studded with polyrhythms. The chillwave synths that kick off the album opener, “Track Uno,” prop up restless rhythms that morph several times throughout the song. They drive it forward into the Riggins feature “Bus Ride,” and the momentum never lets up.</p>
<p>Kay’s inventive percussion keeps the album upbeat, but it’s often a dreamy, mellow listen, perhaps a result of the producer’s effort to broaden perceptions of his capabilities. Many of the featured collaborators, including Phonte, Syd, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33213-andersonpaak/"">Anderson .Paak</a>, are hip-hop adjacent artists who have refused to be constrained by the dogmas of the genre, something that seems to have inspired Kay. Syd and Phonte in particular, have helped to define a contemporary, melodic take on funk, combining soul, R&amp;B, and a dash of electronica. Their features, “One Too Many” and “You’re the One,” on which Kay showcases his love for warmly shimmering synths, are two of the album’s strongest.</p>
<p>Only four of the album’s fifteen tracks do not feature a guest, but even without any company, Kaytranada displays plenty of range. His most impressive solo cut is “Lite Spots,” a rework of the Brazilian singer Gal Costa’s 1973 track, “Pontos De Luz.” Kay takes advantage of the abrupt shifts in tempo in Costa’s original vocal, assembling a circle of handclaps and other percussive quirks to maximize the song’s potential as a house party special.</p>
<p>Even on his collaborations with more traditional hip-hop and R&amp;B artists, Kaytranada rarely reaches for the radio, avoiding formulaic structures. His track with AlunaGeorge, “Together,” is almost all hook, with an energized central verse from the D.C. rapper GoldLink. On the Vic Mensa feature, “Drive Me Crazy,” the outro takes up almost half the track’s running time. It’s long been clear that Kay thinks of vocals as just another musical element, which helps him to make even the most unmemorable guest performances function as dependable instruments. (Also clear: his lack of interest in lyrics, the only generic aspect of <i>99.9%, </i>and the one element that doesn’t bear traces of his close attention.)</p>
<p>There are two other features on <i>99.9%</i> that should not escape mention. Anderson .Paak’s contribution, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18171-kaytranada-glowed-up-ft-anderson-paak/"">Glowed Up</a>,” is a two-part suite that make use of the Oxnard artist’s skills as a rapper and a singer respectively, emphasizing just how much Kay can accomplish with a similarly creative collaborator. The other is extra-musical: The album’s cover, painted by the globetrotting Spanish artist Ricardo Cavolo, is warm, colorful and psychedelic, as perfect a match for the record’s sound as any of its tracks. (Cavolo also contributed animated sketches for each track, which can be found on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kaytranada/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a>.)</p>
<p>Kaytranada picked Cavolo out personally, of course, just one more example of his painstaking focus on nearly every detail. Though his credentials are those of an artist who came of age in a digital era, his album is replete with the qualities that we associate with the analogue. It echoes the warm, melodic funk of golden<i>-</i>era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a> far more closely than, say, the flatscreen sheen of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21836-drake-views/"">VIEWS</a></i>, revealing the increasing uselessness of the word “digital” as a descriptor. There’s certainly nothing programmed about Kaytranada’s approach. His record’s name is meant to suggest a certain sense of incompleteness, but it’s one of the most well-edited, coherent debuts to emerge in recent memory.</p></div>"|21899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21899-999/|8.0|Jonah Bromwich

It was 2009, and the track—six somber minutes of gelatinous, pitch-black drones and a doleful, harpsichord-like synth melody—didn't sound like anything else he had ever done. And that's saying something, because Pritchard has done a lot: Between his time in iconic early-'90s groups like Global Communication, Jedi Knights, and Reload, plus an array of solo aliases including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27389-harmonic-313/"">Harmonic 313</a> and Troubleman, the UK producer made ambient, electro, house, acid, instrumental hip-hop, and broken beat, among other styles and hybrids. Not long after ""?"" appeared as the A-side of a 10"" single (the B-side cut, ""The Hologram,"" sounded more like a lost Mo Wax instrumental from the mid '90s), he embarked upon his career's wildly prolific second act, making dancehall, grime, footwork, trap, ragga-jungle, and throwback rave tunes in the duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29608-africa-hitech/"">Africa Hitech</a> and under his own name. Throughout it all, ""?"" felt like an outlier among outliers; in an oeuvre full of left turns, it was the only one that didn't seemed to have steered him full circle.</p>
<p>Seven years later, that stray puzzle piece falls into place as the opening track on <i>Under the Sun</i>. ""?"" has always had a liminal feel to it—a number of DJs, including the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28105-the-gaslamp-killer/"">Gaslamp Killer</a>, Manuel Tur, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22672-oneman/"">Oneman</a>, have used it to open mixtapes, and a few more have closed out their mixes with it—and here it also plays a scene-setting role, establishing the base notes of one of the most curious and idiosyncratic records in Pritchard's catalog. For the most part devoid of drums, <i>Under the Sun</i> is loosely ambient in feel, but it's a world away from the lushly psychedelic chillout-room tropes of Global Communication. Many of its tracks feel like soundtrack cues, and its blippy analog palette often suggests the influence of Delia Derbyshire and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. There are nods to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>, particularly in the vocoded recitation of colors in ""Hi Red,"" the shortest of a number of sketch-like, interstitial cuts. But the album's most unusual aspect, and its unifying thread, are the thin, quavering synthesizer patches suggestive of flute and clarinet and recorder, which, playing quiet, contrapuntal melodies, imbue the album with an almost medieval air.</p>
<p>Against this atmospheric backdrop, a few key vocal features help give the album its shape and sense of movement. The first, immediately following the ambient intro of ""?,"" is the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"">Bibio</a>-sung ""Give It Your Choir,"" which pairs chiming synth parts with richly colored vocal harmonies that whirl like the beads in a kaleidoscope. For much of the warm, woozy ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18128-mark-pritchard-beautiful-people-ft-thom-yorke/"">Beautiful People</a>,"" Thom Yorke's voice is processed nearly beyond recognition, and even when the effects are stripped away, it sounds like he's singing through clenched teeth, his words reduced to something like pure tone. But the odd phrases that sneak through (""Angels stroke your head,"" ""I can't go back"") reinforce the song's dream-like logic, forever on the verge of pulling into focus. ""The Blinds Cage"" also bobs on the surface of consciousness, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/104-anti-pop-consortium/"">Anti-Pop Consortium</a>'s Beans narrates a stream-of-consciousness report from the border between life and death over a blippy backdrop of electronic abstractions.</p>
<p>In the album's centerpiece, ""You Wash My Soul,"" the folksinger <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3422-linda-perhacs/"">Linda Perhacs</a> is accompanied by delicately plucked acoustic guitar as she sings mournfully of elemental forces and spiritual connections. At once chilly and pastoral, it's evocative of a strain of gothic folk that stretches back through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2168-jarboe/"">Jarboe</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/906-current-93/"">Current 93</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a>; it's the polar opposite of ""Infrared,"" a nervous synth'n'roll number that's reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>. On paper, the two songs might not seem to have much to do with each other, but part of the beauty of the album is how it pulls such contrasting moods together into a coherent whole.</p>
<p>Deeply atmospheric and richly impressionistic, <i>Under the Sun </i>is an easy album to disappear into. Alternating short sketches with long, immersive tracks like the sumptuously droning ""EMS,"" and balancing emotional vocal tracks with more abstracted moodpieces, it never feels scattered; instead, each piece leads into the next, like the segments of a maze. I put it on for an hour-long perambulation through the city and found myself cozily cocooned in its folds. I was surprised, when I finally took my headphones off, to be confronted with the lively din of an outdoor café I had been idly watching for 15 minutes; it felt as though I had been zapped back to the heart of the city, transported from a faraway place that was green and warm and ancient. The only question was how music so simple, and almost naïve, had done such a thorough job of erasing the traces of the modern world around me.</p></div>"|21785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21785-under-the-sun/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

But, given the chance, they’d surely hop the fence. Make all the “Oldchella” cracks you want—there are still a whole lot of young folk who bow before rock ‘n’ roll’s few remaining golden gods, and in three short years, Twin Peaks have proven themselves quick studies in the ways of tradition. In stark defiance of The Who’s “hope I die before I get old” edict, the relaxed, easy-going groove of <i>Down in Heaven</i> suggests this Chicago garage-rock outfit can’t wait to age.</p>
<p>Already, the band seems decades removed from their 2013 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18285-twin-peaks-sunken/"">Sunken</a></i>, recorded when they were still teenagers and sounding very much like it—carefree, cocky, and sloppy. The follow-up, 2014’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19515-twin-peaks-wild-onion/"">Wild Onion</a></i>, tightened up the songcraft, amped up their attack, and spit-shined the production, suggesting aspirations to follow fellow Chi-town miscreants <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30585-the-orwells/"">The Orwells</a> down the path of major-label patronage and late-night talk-show appearances. But with <i>Down in Heaven</i>, Twin Peaks have already initiated the rural retreat that most rock bands take only after succumbing to excess, holing themselves up in a friend’s northern Massachusetts studio-house and turning it into a veritable retirement home for early twenty-somethings. The result is a casual, charmingly low-key set of kitchen-table blues, slow-dance serenades, and unplugged power pop. Here, Twin Peaks aren’t so interested in being the life of party as documenting what happens outside of it: the awkward first kisses, the difficult break-up conversations, the sad walks home alone.</p>
<p>It’s a really good look for them. By toning down their sound, Twin Peaks are better able to amplify the sweet/sour tension between honey-voiced vocalists Cadien Lake James and Jack Dolan, and their more acid-tongued compatriot, Clay Frankel. But even as down ‘n’ out diatribes like “Cold Lips” wallow in cruel sentiment (to wit: “you ought to get yourself a shiny gold medal for being the coldest bitch I know”), <i>Down in Heaven</i> exudes a welcoming, wood-panelled warmth. But Twin Peaks take certain liberties with the past, weaving alternate histories into a sound that’s familiar yet peculiar. Their version of the Stones folds the raw blues of <i>Beggars Banquet</i> into the smooth, falsettoed soul of “Beast of Burden”; their definition of cool is equal parts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a> and Tom Petty. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And with the recruitment of keyboardist, Colin Croom, Twin Peaks acquire their own Benmont Tench, swaddling beautifully bruised ballads like “Holding Roses” in soothing Hammond tones or guiding the bouncing-ball rhythm of Dolan’s delightful “Getting Better” with playful piano rolls. </span></p>
<p>Twin Peaks still flash some swagger between their more sensitive moments, though in these cases, it’s harder to parse their personality from their source material: “Keep It Together” is essentially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>’s “Mod Lang” dipped in extra<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/""> T. Rex </a>glitter, while “Butterfly” loads up on <i>Loaded</i>, copping everything from Lou Reed’s streetwise sneer on “Head Held High” to the “ba ba bas” from “Who Loves the Sun” for good measure. While these songs reinforce a definition of garage-rock steeped in impetuous, middle-fingered attitude, <i>Down in Heaven</i>’s more revelatory slow songs remind us that the genre has always been an outlet for misfit romantics to express feelings they’d be too shy and embarrassed to say in person. In other words, it’s a music for neglected nice guys as much as boisterous bad boys. With <i>Down in Heaven</i>, Twin Peaks come off like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"">Black Lips</a> that would rather drink apple juice instead of <a href=""http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2007/09/14/lips-try-to-pee-in-their-mouths-fail/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their own piss</a>, and seem evermore willing to embrace the idea that they’re actually better at kiss-off ballads than kicked-out jams.</p></div>"|21724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21724-down-in-heaven/|7.2|Stuart Berman

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Steelpan drums are traditionally hammered out of 55-gallon oil barrels and inextricably linked to Trinidad, where they were invented in the 1930s, borne into the island’s calypso and soca music traditions, and have since been co-opted around the world. The metallic ping a pan makes is entirely unique for an acoustic instrument. With a series of soft strikes, players can conjure a swelling, fluttering effect; with stronger contact a pan rattles. More generally, the sustained notes obscure the player’s attack, as if the sound floated into earshot from a faraway place instead of bursting from an acute mallet strike. Conversely, it’s almost impossible to achieve the sharp briefness of a staccato. It’s a deceptively sensitive piece of metal that is easy to make loud but finicky to get right. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wagner spent time learning the instrument and commissioning a handmade pan for himself while in Trinidad and Tobago, and Bacao released its first two songs—a pair of Meters covers—in 2007. By the following year, the group had grown more playful with its covers, releasing a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjLRsHs2ABU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stunning instrumental take</a> on<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/""> 50 Cent</a>’s “P.I.M.P.” that sounds unmistakably like the steelpan riff at the heart of the rapper's original, now with the added appeal of a Caribbean groove and the kind of swampy horn solo expected of a Latin jazz burner. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">About half the songs on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">55 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">are covers, all of which are immediately endearing. Since its invention and because of its timbral distinction, the steelpan has long been an instrument used for unexpected covers of popular songs. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">55,</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">which places previous singles alongside new tracks,</span></span> <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sidesteps pure novelty factor in that the band is an impeccably tight funk outfit to begin with, and the pan is folded in as seasoning. Given that Wagner and his bandmates are recent converts, none of the pan playing on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">55</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is flashily virtuosic, but they’re deft and restrained use of the instrument—in this case both a single tenor steelpan as well as the lower registered double second pan—is nonetheless the album’s obvious calling card.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Dog Was a Doughnut,” a delightful rework of Cat Steven’s shifty electronic original, is one of the album’s most sparsely arranged, the pan walking in awkward step with the rest of the percussion instead of standing out front. Bacao is prone to crisp mid-song breaks that frequently center percussive elements like a cowbell as much as a drum kit, but the group has the impressive coordination to move as one as well. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The guitar is sometimes tucked into the groove as a jangling or ticking rhythmic element, but on tracks like “Queen of Cheeba,” a constant guitar riff becomes the woozy centerpiece of a psychedelic-tinged Latin jam. Originally a 1980s political anthem from John Holt about marijuana in Jamaica, “Police in Helicopter"" digs into heavy psychedelic reggae territory instead. “Scorpio,” an oft-sampled legendary breakbeat track from Dennis Coffey, gets a true-to-form but sped-up rendition here that trades the famously overdubbed guitar motif for the sound of the featured instrument. As a groove-forward band, Bacao are shape-shifters in the best sense. </span></p>
<p>As the “P.I.M.P.” rendition suggests, Bacao are also molded by hip-hop. On “Round &amp; Round,” they flip the smoothness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4971-hi-tek/"">Hi-Tek</a>’s wondrous original beat into a lazy shuffle, the pan clunkily plucking out the catchy refrain while the guitar creeps alongside. It’s “Love Like This,” a slinky cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10693-faith-evans/"">Faith Evans</a>’ Grammy-nominated Bad Boy-era R&amp;B hit, that takes the cake, accomplishing the rare intersection of unexpected and obvious. Like much of the album, “Love Like This,” which carries a cleaner bassline than the sampled original, is built by the heavy lifting of the traditional rhythm core; the pan then drives it home. The album’s original compositions are mostly impressive themselves: “Bacao Suave” is a horn-heavy, Latin-tinged jam, while “Port of Spain Hustle” offers up the slick-moving rhythm guitar and stabbing horn runs of a disco classic.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even though the songs themselves are short, at 16 tracks, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">55 </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">runs a </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">touch too long, and some of the band’s early standout singles are sorely missing. Still, steelpan homages this delightfully listenable and yet devoid of schtick deserve credit. Bacao is a fantastic funk band first and foremost—the pan just adds some well-earned panache.</span></p></div>"|21908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21908-55/|7.4|Jay Balfour

By defining the phrase, Negativland and their peers legitimized it as a tool to deface and expose the dark side of capitalism, inviting artists to punch back through graffiti, guerrilla radio, fliers, and other media. With the advent of Internet and social media, culture jamming’s grown more ubiquitous than ever. (As a matter of fact, the word “meme” also refers to the imagery that jammers disseminate en masse.) Just like graffiti, <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1012106-ironic-memes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dat Boi</a>, <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/boaty-mcboatface-parliament-lessons/482046/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boaty McBoatface</a>, and <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/make-america-great-again"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Make America Great Again hats</a> disrupt our global communication systems and incite reactions ranging from befuddled amusement to anger, fear, and dejection.</p>
<p>Zach Hill, Andy Morin, and Stefan Burnett (otherwise known as MC Ride) are easily the most talented, impactful culture jammers of the streaming age: a distinction primarily owed to just how seriously the California trio take those ideas. Never mind the Trojan Horse they pulled on Epic, the deep web album leaks, the no-shows—the real subversion’s in Death Grips' music, which continues to draw huge audiences (see: the massive crowd who filled the Gobi tent for their headlining Coachella set) and unsurprisingly, co-signs from fellow pranksters like Tyler, the Creator and Eric André. It’s no surprise that the loudest contingency of their fanbase resides on an infamous image-board; Death Grips speak directly to the dark worldview that accompanies years wasted lurking online, getting high off digital schadenfreude. (Been there.)</p>
<p> On their new album <i>Bottomless Pit</i>, they stitch together one of their most cohesive grotesques ever, renewing their focus on songcraft, rather than chicanery. It's sure to elicit a sigh of relief among fans who’ve grown jaded with the band’s work. Opening track “Giving Bad People Good Ideas"" opens on a feint—an eerie, descending vocal from Cherry Glazerr vocalist Clementine Creevy, the feminine foil to macho, malicious Burnett. The lilting intro gives way to a black-metal sprint, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31132-tera-melos/"" target=""_blank"">Tera Melos</a>’ Nick Reinhart churning out jagged tremolo riffs. The follow-up blow carries that momentum further: “Hot Head” starts off inside a cartoon <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtwFIjifGgo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fight cloud</a> spinning off towards oblivion, a blur of percussive jabs, whooshing machines, and screamed gibberish. From there, the song takes an equally disorienting nose-dive into a slack, spacious verse. </p>
<p>Death Grips draw heavily on abrasive styles, but the group are arguably at their most lethal when they're hijacking popular tastes, as they did on 2012’s<i> The Money Store, </i>and as they do here. With their stacked guitar riffs, dissonant samples, and glitchy percussion, “Spikes” and “Three Bedrooms In A Good Neighborhood” invoke an alternate history where hip-hop and metal fusion didn't dead-end into visions of Fred Durst’s punchable mug. The EBM-flavored “80808” supercharges a house-y backbeat with additional crackles and pops; the choruses expand that texture, dialing up the voltage until the synths alight in an arc flash. The most straightforward of these standouts is “Eh,” a rap song anchored in glimmering, burbling synths that dart in and out of the bass drums’ margins. Unmoved by the giddy surroundings, Burnett deadpans his morbid imagery with unusual calm, as if a tranquilizer dart struck him mid-verse: “Catch me hanging from my noose like ehhhh,” he yawns, stretching out the final syllable like putty.</p>
<p>MC Ride has long been regarded as Death Grips’ anchor, both onstage and off: a privilege largely owed to a pair of vocal cords which never seem to tire, even as the man screams himself sick. On <i>Bottomless Pit</i> he offers his most athletic performance to date, double-dutching over fallen power on “80808,” bobbing and weaving over Krautrock shards on “Ring A Bell,” and howling out in agony as the machines draw and quarter him on “Warping.” It’s not all gloom-and-doom, however; “Bubbles Buried in this Jungle” and “Trash"" showcase a seething monotone delivery that taps into the absurd, comedic undertones buried in this madcap project. It's certainly difficult not to crack a smile on ""Houdini,"" wherein he roasts hipsters (“Fuck is that, a hairstyle?/This asshole be at pussy church, first”) and instructs us,“Don’t stop that okey doke stroke.”</p>
<p>For all its chaos and fury, <i>Bottomless Pit</i> is Death Grips' most accessible record since<i> The Money Store.</i> It has a distractingly uneven mix, seesawing from grit to gloss and back again, and some of the sparser moments, like mid-album would-be barnburner ""Houdini,"" are trying, but overall it is a resounding success. It might not win them new fans, but ""new fans"" have never been an integral part of the Death Grips experience: You're either in or you're out.  If you're in, you will probably grin wider than you have through any Death Grips album in years.</p></div>"|21879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21879-bottomless-pit/|8.1|Zoe Camp

Unlike his mentor <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Schaeffer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pierre Schaeffer</a> and his peers in the avant-garde and academic communities, Jarre married sweet, hummable melodies and traditional European harmonies to star-gazing soundscapes, making electronics seem safe and inviting to the masses. To some, this was tantamount to treason; one of <a href=""http://www.artype.de/Sammlung/pdf/russolo_noise.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">electronic music's first manifestos</a>, written by Luigi Russolo in 1913, demanded composers “break at all costs from this restrictive circle of pure sounds and conquer the infinite variety of noise-sounds.” For those not interested in modernist treatises and radical new forms, however, Jarre was the sound of the future.</p>
<p>Without doubt, Jarre was on the right side of history. In addition to album sales well into the millions, in 1979 he broke the world's record for concert attendance, bringing 1,000,000 people to Paris' Place de la Concorde (he went on to break that record <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_concerts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">three more times</a>). Yet in many ways his influence pales in comparison to his sales; his sheen is futuristic but his music looks fondly to the past. Though titled <i>Electronica 2: The Heart of Noise</i>, Jarre's latest album is anything but an exploration of the genre's roots in the radical manipulations of raw sound and analogue circuitry. Rather, it's an overstuffed, overlong string of collaborations that smothers Jarre's nimble melodicism under heaving EDM production and spooks his guests into cliches of themselves, or worse.</p>
<p>And what a series of guests. The Pet Shop Boys, Yello, and Gary Numan are all here, as well as Cyndi Lauper, ambient pioneers the Orb and pop shapeshifters Primal Scream. In their heyday, each of these artists had an unmistakable sound signature (except perhaps Primal Scream, who made a career out of reinvention), yet on<i> Electronica 2 </i>they are bulldozed by Jarre's production. There are flashes of recognition, such as the gospel choir on Primal Scream collab “As One,” an obvious nod to “Come Together.” More often though, Jarre appears resolutely in the driver's seat. For the previous installation<i>, Electronica 1:The Time Machine</i>, he said he tailored each song as a demo with the specific collaborator in mind, to be fleshed out or rewritten together in the studio later. If that's true here, it's hard to tell. </p>
<div>
<p>Jarre's decades on stadium stages may have something to do with the broader-than-broad strokes employed throughout the album. His preference is for slow, bombastic tempos and questing, classically-leaning chord progressions, and he runs this formula into the ground. The arrangements, heavily layered and sound-designed, telegraph an up-to-the-minute sheen yet lack a timeless quality. Sadly the effect carries over to the singers' performances; Lauper attempts an Ellie Goulding impression on “Swipe to the Right.” Numan, once both campy and sleek, is a bogged-down wannabe pop messiah on “Here for You.” The Pet Shop Boys fare a little better on “Brick England”—they simply sound like a boring version of themselves. Yello are meanwhile unrecognizable on the aptly titled existential dirge “Why This, Why That and Why.”</p>
<p>Other collaborations promise to push Jarre a bit out of his comfort zone, yet you feel him fussing. The presence of Jeff Mills suggests that Jarre might be game for a descent into a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WESBdvsWM0k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">techno wormhole</a>. Though “The Architect” eventually speeds up to a danceable clip and features traces of the claustrophobic minimalism that Mills perfected in his younger years, it also foregrounds string flourishes worthy of a James Bond opening sequence. The structure, too, is a mess, scrolling through breakdowns, sequences and buildups that have little relation to each other. </p>
<p>Intriguingly, the brief presence of NSA whistleblower and non-musician Edward Snowden on “Exit” yields the liveliest results. Jarre <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/15/jean-michel-jarre-records-with-edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">described the track</a> as “trying to illustrate the idea of this crazy quest for big data on one side and the manhunt for this one young guy by the CIA, NSA and FBI on the other,” and “Exit” could certainly soundtrack a frenetic chase scene. Mid-song, the music slows to a halt and Snowden gets on the mic: “Technology can actually increase privacy... Saying that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say... And if you don't stand up for it, then who will?” Jarre grabs that last phrase and loops it as he builds to a rushing climax. It's grandiose, cheesy and sounds like any generic rave scene in a movie, but coming halfway through <i>Electronica 2</i>'s slog, it's a high point.</p>
</div>
<p>Closing with a pair of solo expeditions, one strangely credited “with JMJ himself,” the lasting impression isn't of a journey to the heart of noise, but rather of a blustery loneliness. Jarre recorded his breakthrough 1976 album <i>Oxygene</i> in his kitchen on a rudimentary setup; now he's has assembled a collection of his ""<a href=""https://jmjarrefan.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/electronic-beats-interview-fall-2015/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heroes</a>"" and been given access to the finest studios in the world and yet repeatedly fails to engage the imagination. One senses a massively missed opportunity, a chance for exploration blown by Jarre's insatiable need to make everything bigger, more impressive. Perhaps Yello caught a glimpse of this while working on their lyrics: “trying to dig out the man that I could be, and I was shouting loud to find there's little me. ”    </p></div>"|21876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21876-electronica-2-the-heart-of-noise/|4.9|Daniel Martin-McCormick

It’s not too hard to understand why. A pioneer of laptop-based music that was at turns abrasive and sublime, the Austrian producer’s early records could be a bit intimidating, even alongside the work of experimental-minded peers like Jim O’Rourke, Fennesz, and Kevin Drumm. And it also doesn’t help that the last album released under his most prolific alias, Pita, came out more than a decade ago. Yet, it’s hard to think of anybody whose work—both as an artist and a label owner—has remained more deeply embedded in the DNA of contemporary electronic and out-there music. </p>
<p>Founded in the mid-'90s, Rehberg’s label, Mego, released computer music that defied classification, existing outside of terms like “dance” or “ambient.” The label’s most enduring releases – Fennesz’s <i>Endless Summer</i>, O’Rourke’s <i>I’m Happy and I’m Singing</i>, Drumm’s <i>Sheer Hellish Miasma</i> – made digitally mulched sounds register as dense and organic. That label’s Rehberg-run successor, Editions Mego, has proven equally influential, releasing records that helped establish American Kosmiche nobility like Emeralds, Oneohtrix Point Never, and Keith Fullerton Whitman. And that’s not even counting Editions Mego’s multitude of artist-curated sub-labels, which include Spectrum Spools (Emeralds’ John Elliott), Recollection GRM (curated by François Bonnet and Daniel Teruggi), Ideologic Organ (Stephen O'Malley), and Old News (Jim O’Rourke). You can also hear traces of Rehberg’s gritty sound design in releases on edgier contemporary dance labels like Trilogy Tapes and PAN. He even beat Matmos to the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9OjIaR1o5E&amp;list=PL4PVIjcpRKJ4ABMAkLDimzl7BAZljef5d"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">household appliance thing </a>by two decades.</p>
<p><i>Get In </i>is Rehberg’s first release as Pita since 2004’s <i>Get Off</i> and it picks up more or less where its predecessor left off. The sound design is cleaner and richer in detail, but the same rules apply. It is a record defined by not-so-subtle shifts in volume and intensity. Serene drones give way to rubbery atonal squelch. Familiar tones are dissected and decimated. On “S200729” the burble of a TB-303 bassline – the defining sound of acid house – is digitally deconstructed from a warm analog burble into the kind of sound that could bust up asphalt.</p>
<p>Attitude was a key to Pita’s first records: They were loud and rude. The music might lull you into a false sense of security only to turn around and fry your eardrums. However, <i>Get In </i>is more gripping in its meditative moments. On “Line Angel” glimmering keyboard tones are periodically interrupted and skewed out of tune, dive-bombing from soothing to seasick. “Mfbk” is more earnest, ascending in volume to reveal generative melodies and cello-like tones that evoke Brian Eno’s <i>Discreet Music. </i>If you’re a long-time Pita listener, you might keep the volume low, just in case a shocking blast of fuzz is imminent. The punishment never comes, though. </p>
<p>The tools that are used in its creation define so much about electronic music – it’s utility, it’s time and place. Rehberg’s process has always been a bit mysterious, though. It’s the product of a set of programs, rather than a table full of boxes and knobs. In concert, the back of a laptop screen obscures his moves, and it’s harder to date his records as a result. <i>Get In </i>was recorded last year, but it sounds like it could have been made at any time over the intervening decade. There are no melodic clichés to give it away and no organized rhythms. The sounds are proto-human, primeval and timeless.</p></div>"|21820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21820-get-in/|7.2|Aaron Leitko

Their first LP, <i>Get Gone, </i>brandishes<i> </i>playful guitar hooks that swing in at just the right moments, but Haynes is the band’s best asset, lighting these otherwise-conventional songs on fire. </p>
<p>In their mix of soulful grease and punky grit, Seratones feel like a natural, rollicking complement to The Alabama Shakes, but it’s not quite fair to call them a ripoff. Where the Shakes go for the groovy soul of Muscle Shoals, Seratones instead veer toward swinging Southern garage rock. <i>Get Gone’s </i>guitars crackle with the heat of the band’s native Louisiana. In his earliest days as a Squirrel Nut Zipper, <i>Get Gone</i> producer Jimbo Mathus specialized in fast-and-loose tunes that sounded like they might fly apart at any moment, an energy the Seratones often capture well (though some extra occasional grit wouldn’t hurt, either).</p>
<p>Haynes attributes her vocal prowess to learning to sing in a church choir from a young age, and she shows off her quivering high notes right away on opener “Choking On Your Spit,” balancing it neatly with a sneer at the song's recipient. When she belts that she’s seen the light “Don’t Need It,” you <i>believe</i> it. She slinks a little lower on the more blues-inclined title track before cutting in with sharp, cathartic “Ooh-ooh!”s for the song’s chorus.</p>
<p>The band is at is best when it’s playing fast and tight, as with the bright, soaring “Sun.” They lose momentum on the drifting “Tide” early in the record before picking up with the punchier “Chandelier,” and closing track “Keep Me” is pretty, but it feels like a sleepy, anticlimactic close to a record that otherwise vibrates with energy. “Kingdom Come” begins with an impatient patter before dipping into chugging guitar riffs, combining for a track that oozes anticipation.</p>
<p>Haynes' charisma is palpable through almost every song—even the giggles that bubble up on “Kingdom Come” inject the record with a genuine joy. She ends that song with the line, “I’ll be your best, believe me,” delivering the last two words like a slow punch to the gut. She does so much work on <i>Get Gone</i> that you wind up hoping she follows through on her promise. </p></div>"|21859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21859-get-gone/|6.8|Allison Hussey

Their music is obsessed with the point where great truths harden into platitudes, where pure signal meets wretched noise. In the past, Thom Yorke has sharply peppered his lyrics with everyday cliches to suggest a mind consumed by meaningless data, but on the new album, he largely moves beyond cynicism. He is now considering simpler truths in a heretofore-unexplored register: wonder and amazement. “This goes beyond me, beyond you,” he sings on “Daydreaming.” “We are just happy to serve you.” There is no concealed razor under Yorke’s tongue as he offers this thought, or in the pearly music that surrounds him. It sounds for all the world like the most cloistered and isolated soul in modern rock music opening up and admitting a helplessness far more personal than he’s ever dared. Yorke has flirted with surrender before, and on <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i>, that submission feels nearly complete.</p>
<p>The album is framed by two older pieces of music that act as gateways to the darker, unfamiliar waters within. Opener “Burn the Witch” has been floating around, in some form or another, since <i>Kid A</i>. “This is a low-flying panic attack,” Yorke announces, explicitly linking to the bad old days of air crashes, iron lungs, and wolves at doors. (In fact, several of the song’s lyrics—“avoid all eye contact,” “cheer at the gallows”—first <a href=""http://citizeninsane.eu/burnthewitch.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">appeared</a> in the album art to 2003’s anti-Bush polemic <i>Hail to the Thief</i>.) Meanwhile, Jonny Greenwood’s brittle modernist string arrangement reinforces the angst, turning the orchestra into a giant pair of gnashing teeth. It’s a vintage splash of Radiohead stomach acid, a cloud of gnats unleashed in your cranial nerves.</p>
<p>It also feels like an exorcism for what follows: a plunge into something scarier than the military industrial complex, or the insidious nature of propaganda, or human nature’s disturbing tendency towards unquestioning obedience. Yorke separated from his partner of 23 years and the mother to his two children last August, and on “Identikit,” he sings “Broken hearts make it rain” and “When I see you messin’ me around, I don’t want to know.”</p>
<p>That isn’t to say that this is necessarily a “break-up album.” Separations (particularly those involving children) take place in the harsh light of day, with lawyers’ appointments and checklists and logistical arrangements. Radiohead albums are the stuff of dreams and nightmares, and the band retains a healthy resistance to clarity; their music is a maze of signs you can peer into any way you like. Even so, the impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open in the way you can only be after a tragedy. “There’s a spacecraft blocking out the sky,” Yorke observes on “Decks Dark,” as choral voices pass overhead. The scene is straight from 1997’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1tQFX_9ct0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Subterranean Homesick Alien</a>,” but here Yorke doesn’t sound “uptight.” He sounds utterly drained, as if impending invasion doesn’t concern him at all.</p>
<p>A song title like “Glass Eyes” hints at many of the band’s longstanding morbid preoccupations—the semblance of humanity in something cold and dead, or the violation of the biological body by foreign objects—but the song is a bloodflow of strings straight into the heart. “Hey it’s me, I just got off the train,” Yorke sings, and it’s a strikingly ordinary image: the Paranoid Android himself, picking up the phone and calling someone to tell them he’s just arrived. “I feel this love turn cold,” he confesses as the ballad draws to a close, the phrasing an echo, subconscious or not, of his<i> Kid A</i> sign-off “I’ll see you in the next life.” A throbbing cello appears like a lump in the throat; the song fades away.</p>
<p>Throughout the album, Yorke’s everyday enlightenment is backed by music of expanse and abandon. The guitars sound like pianos, the pianos sound like guitars, and the mixes breathe with pastoral calm. “The Numbers,” a song about the impending apocalypse brought on by climate change, meanders along, its groove as wide as an ocean. Even the malevolent synth wave that passes through “Ful Stop” sounds like a visitor, a momentary darkness rather than a caged spirit. As the song builds, the band works up a coursing groove that will feel familiar to longtime fans, with its interlocking guitars and an arterial bustle of rhythms serving to launch Yorke’s wordless moan. It’s a sound that Radiohead has spent the last decade honing, but the payoff here is deeper and more gratifying than it has been in a while.</p>
<p>The added dimension comes from Yorke, who pumps fresh oxygen into these songs, many of which have existed in sketch-like forms for years. On the lonely folk hymn “Desert Island Disk,” he sings of an epiphanic experience: “The wind rushing ‘round my open heart/An open ravine/In my spirit white.” As a vision of transformation, it feels like the inverse to <i>Amnesiac’</i>s “Pyramid Song,” where his only companions were the dead; here, he is “totally alive.”</p>
<p>And then there’s “True Love Waits.” It’s an old song, one that has been around in various forms for over <a href=""http://citizeninsane.eu/truelovewaits.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two decades</a>, but unlike “Burn the Witch” or the other teased sketches and scraps that Radiohead diehards pick apart on forums, it’s long been a part of their canon. It appeared on the 2001 live album <i>I Might Be Wrong</i> and, dragged into 2016, feels like a relic from a different geological era. “I’ll drown my beliefs,” Yorke sings, “just don’t leave.” It is the message they leave us with, this very open-hearted song that has always felt like an open wound in their discography, a geyser of feeling erupting out of scorched earth. Its very inclusion is a striking moment of transparency.</p>
<p>The version here is just Yorke and a piano, so reverberant and echo-drenched that it feels like we’ve stuck our heads inside it. Yorke croons tenderly, never opening up into his chest voice. It’s sung to one person this time, not crowds. In its mundane visions of “lollipops and crisps,” the lyrics purposefully skirt doggerel, an acknowledgment that cliches can be, in fact, where all the action is. “I’m not living/I’m just killing time,” the 47-year-old admits. You can write a line like that and set it to music; you can perform it for years in front of adoring millions; you can carry the idea around in your heart and mind. But it might take a lifetime for it to strike, as it does here, with a newfound power. The truth, as always, lies in plain sight, right there in the kicking and the squealing, the panic and the vomit. Some truths just take longer to see than others.</p></div>"|21907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21907-a-moon-shaped-pool/|9.1|Jayson Greene

Frontman Ellery Roberts, then 21, was the architect of their spectacular demise: ""WU LYF is dead to me,"" he declared in an open letter to his bandmates, complaining that their acclaimed debut, a kind of protest album for the disenchanted, had got his revolutionary energy all messed up. ""The sincerity of ‘Go tell fire’ was lost in the bull shit of maintaining face in the world we live,"" he wrote. Roberts’ return a year later, a solo <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDv4Ukyjbic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for ""Kerou’s Lament,"" which depicted a little girl drenching herself in gasoline and threatening to self-immolate, felt like a reprimand to anyone still unconvinced of Roberts’ grandiose sincerity. He doubled down last November, publishing a 1000-word manifesto for LUH (Lost Under Heaven)—his new project with the visual artist Ebony Hoorn—which seemed to rally for the downfall of western capitalism.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Unsurprisingly, LUH’s debut album, <i>Spiritual Songs for Lovers to Sing</i>, is not an exercise in subtlety. Roberts’ embattled rasp still dominates, thrashing about like a blindfolded gargoyle. His lyrics, a fervid blend of self-seriousness and paranoia, pursue doomed dreams in the face of unnamed oppressors. For Roberts, music is a furnace in which to hurl the caution and humility he believes restrain us in everyday life. The result is a revelatory experience that requires no legible revelations: vocals of ecstatic defiance matched to music seemingly composed of pure magnitude; melancholic synths, sparse guitars, and bombastic strings and drums. The overall feeling is of an all-hands, against-the-odds triumph against staggering forces. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Roberts' ambition is vague enough to be limitless, and while reliably earnest, he’s uninterested in anyone’s approval. That mix could herald disaster, but Roberts, more restrained as a songwriter than singer, is smart with his flair. Produced by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-haxan-cloak/"">Haxan Cloak</a>, <i>Spiritual Songs for Lovers to Sing</i> is a vast, swaggering colossus, imbued with waves of reverb and gothic flourishes that meet its frontman’s astronomical intensity. ""Lost Under Heaven,"" a magnificent shoegaze thrash, climaxes with a euphoric call-to-arms—""And we all know that it’s bullshit/They say it’s just life, and we live it""—whose crude, cheap-seats sloganeering has no right to feel so poignant.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That being said, chasing crescendos is an exhausting hobby, and the hourlong LP is hard work. It’s unclear whether LUH see <i>Spiritual Songs for Lovers to Sing</i> as playful melodrama or realism in a doomed world; either way, they came equipped for an epic task. The record’s crux is the ravey ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18245-luh-oro/"">$ORO</a>,"" in which Roberts gives voice to an unrepentant one-percenter: ""Once I lived a life like you/Jealous of the ease of a privileged few/But I earned a life like this ... It is something that you’ll never understand/We are born free to exploit this land."" The ensuing drop, a punishing gabber beat reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a>’s ""Black Lake,"" turns the record on its head, clearing the slate for a reflective, romantic closing suite. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The inspiration for that turnaround is Ebony Hoorn, who apparently restored Roberts’ dwindling faith in the human race the moment they met, in 2012, at his squat in Manchester. Her spotlight moment is ""Future Blues,"" a gorgeous ballad of languid guitars, digitized chatter, and slow, sunrise synths: ""I’m so bored of this reality/Of fearful men trying to limit me,"" she sings, poised between despondence and third-act redemption. On ""Lament,"" the update of ""Kerou’s Lament,"" Hoorn concedes, ""There’s still a part of me that wants your love inside of me.""  Her soothing tones are a balm to listeners alongside Roberts’ arid growl, even as her presence lifts him into fits of rapturous defiance: ""To the powers of hope/To the powers that be/You’ve fucked up this world but you won’t fuck with me!""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Roberts’ chronic nihilism, in WU LYF and since, often seems rooted in the ennui of aggressive individualism, where the only thing left to save is oneself (and even that’s barely worth it). ""Lament"" offers up a reprieve, as Roberts clasps onto love like a cliff ledge and clambers right back up, thankful for the air in his lungs. At the end of its video, the band’s initials are sentimentally repurposed: ""Love Unites Humanity."" From a man given to grand anti-capitalist screeds, it’s a disarmingly sweet touch.</span></p></div>"|21888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21888-spiritual-songs-for-lovers-to-sing/|7.8|Jazz Monroe

The collaboration likely wasn’t a big deal for Disclosure fans: The group works with big name R&amp;B singers quite often; compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"">Sam Smith</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a>, Porter is certainly under the radar. For Porter, though, the feature was somewhat surprising given his career path. He’s a jazz artist, the guy in the big hat who used to play football. But ""Holding On"" was a big success despite his low profile, in large part because of Porter's presence. He’s got that <i>voice</i>, so booming and majestic that it cuts through any instrumental, no matter how pronounced or easygoing. On his 2011 single “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmDcWr1yqCc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1960 What?</a>,” for instance, Porter is especially demonstrative, tweaking his strong baritone to lament social injustice. Conversely, on the next year's “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HvpIgHBSdo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Be Good (Lion’s Song)</a>,” the vocalist took his time, carefully peeling off each word through a sweet, conversational cadence. With these songs and others, Porter thrives using a unique style, an ever-changing vocal magnitude you simply have to hear to appreciate. He sings with conviction, calmly drawing you in, like having a long chat with an old friend.</p>
<p>Despite two successful albums, 2011’s <i>Water</i> and 2012’s <i>Be Good</i>, Porter hit a high mark on 2013’s <i>Liquid Spirit</i>, which won the Grammy a year later for Best Jazz Vocal Album. Powered by songs “No Love Dying” and “Hey Laura,” Porter brought true pathos to sentimental tales. While <i>Liquid Spirit</i> was decidedly nostalgic, rooted in traditional jazz and soul, for his new album, <i>Take Me to the Alley</i>, Porter reconnects with long-time collaborator Kamau Kenyatta to create something more serene. With its scant, acoustic backdrop, the mood is overtly relaxed and the pace is low to mid-tempo, making for a record best suited for late night consumption.</p>
<p>Compared with <i>Liquid Spirit</i>, <i>Alley</i> feels more reflective, if not lovelorn. “Don’t Lose Your Steam” and “Day Dream” are coming-of-age tales meant for Porter’s three-year-old son, Demyan. The album’s middle songs—namely “Consequence of Love” and “Don’t Be a Fool”—seem preoccupied with regret, as though the singer wants to atone for mistakes he’s made along the way. “Insanity” speaks to the raw passion lovers sometimes feel for one another. It finds Porter in limbo, that point where the relationship is over but neither person wants to give up. “Sometimes a lover can be angry till the end,” he sings earnestly.</p>
<p>On “More Than a Woman,” Porter sings about his late mother who, while dying from breast cancer, encouraged him to pursue a full-time singing career: “She brought love to my life, gave love light … simple words, I love you, she made true.” Porter is a formidable songwriter with poetic flair, but <i>Alley</i> puts more focus on what he’s saying than the music itself, which lessens the album’s immediate satisfaction. Porter sounds best when his music has greater variation. His narrative stands up here, but without a broader spectrum of sounds, <i>Alley</i> feels a little flat. It’s more of a slow burn and a slight step backward from <i>Liquid Spirit</i>’s dynamic nature. The results are nice, but with too few standouts, <i>Alley</i> breezes by.</p></div>"|21678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21678-take-me-to-the-alley/|6.7|Marcus J. Moore

With its sparse, second-person narrative and hushed fingerpicking, it plays something like a passage from Joan Didion’s <i>The Year of Magical Thinking </i>put to music. Heard in the context of Carpenter’s remarkable recent work, this song is perhaps her defining track: a propulsive series of quiet thoughts expressed with a novelistic eye for detail in her immaculate, articulate whisper. But it also feels like a mission statement.</p>
<p>Just like the narrator of “What to Keep and What to Throw Away,” Carpenter followed <i>Ashes and Roses </i>by taking stock of her own career, reimagining some of her finest compositions backed by a symphony orchestra. <i>Songs from the Movie</i> from 2014 was a pleasant enough album but, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"">Joni Mitchell</a>’s similarly-minded <i>Travelogue</i>, it couldn’t help but feel like an epilogue: the kind of statement an artist makes once she’s said everything she set out to say. That album’s sense of finality may be partly why the arrival of <i>The Things That We Are Made Of</i>—Carpenter’s 14th album and her first produced by David Cobb (Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton)—feels like such a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Cobb’s sparse, raw production is a welcome change of pace for Carpenter, an artist whose lush, country-leaning work has often slipped comfortably into adult contemporary radio, belying her characteristically complex songwriting. On <i>Things</i>, Cobb knows exactly how to complement Carpenter’s work to make her music sound as urgent and intimate as her lyrics. The minimal electric guitars that linger in the background of “The Middle Ages” are sparse and haunting, while “What Does It Mean to Travel” floats with a spacey <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9958-ghosts-of-the-great-highway/"">Ghosts of the Great Highway</a></i><i> </i>weariness. Single and centerpiece “Map of My Heart,” meanwhile, is the jauntiest song Carpenter has put her name to since the ’90s and serves as a reminder of just how influential her particular intonations have been for today’s crop of country-pop crossovers.</p>
<p>It is in this song that Carpenter summarizes the theme of the album in two crucial lines: “I learned how to travel/Just what I can carry.” From the literal journey at the heart of “Livingston” to the more symbolic one in “Deep Deep Down Heart,” nearly every song on <i>Things </i>is tied to the road, giving the album the feel of a long, lonely late night drive. Like many long drives, however, this one gets a little dreary near the end: “Note on a Windshield” tries and fails to transcend the banality of its central metaphor, while the closing title track aims for hymnal and lands closer to lullaby.</p>
<p>The album does itself no favors by stacking all of its most exciting moments at the beginning, and crowding the five-minute ballads together at the end. Still, these are small concerns for a record whose very presence feels like a refreshing return to action. With 11 songs in just under one hour, <i>Things </i>is Carpenter’s briefest collection of new material in over a decade and serves as a fine entry point for newcomers. It is not her most revelatory work, but it is a strong, concise statement from an artist moving more swiftly and confidently than ever—carrying only what is absolutely necessary, and leaving the rest behind.</p></div>"|21878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21878-the-things-that-we-are-made-of/|6.8|Sam Sodomsky

Maybe the team plotting the surprise release of this album was watching storm fronts, waiting for ideal new-James-Blake-album conditions. On first impressions alone, they succeeded wildly: When bed sheets are in disarray, when grey light seeps into wet windows, and the sky is an interminable reminder that there is always a chance of showers, his particular brand of impressionistic melancholy is hard to resist. Stay in bed or descend out into the streets, it doesn't matter, his music finds a way to summon personal rain clouds that follow you wherever you go. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In keeping with his last two albums, <i>The Colour in Anything</i> is a hard, frank, and unsparing listen. But if you listen closer, you will notice some tonal shifts in the fog. For one, Blake shed the monomania of his past work, allowing other voices and sounds to creep in. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He’s noted in interviews that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Colour in Anything </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is meant to</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> represent a sea-change, personally, musically, and geographically. The disposition of this record is suppose to reflect its milieus: Southern California, friendship, and new love. Seven of its 17 tracks were co-produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6945-rick-rubin/"">Rick Rubin</a>. Much of the album was also mixed and mastered at Rubin’s Shangri-La studios in Malibu. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5976-justin-vernon/"">Justin Vernon</a> appear throughout, lending writing and production help. There’s also <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29861-connan-mockasin/"">Connan Mockasin</a>, who appears, bass in hand, for a song. James has stepped out of his London bedroom and invited collaboration at an unprecedented level. Clocking in at 76 minutes, <i>The Colour in Anything</i> is Blake’s wonderfully messy dive into maximalism.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All that said, in the best way possible, in no way shape or form is </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Colour in Anything </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a rapid departure or reversal of what Blake does well. He still paints in deep blues and greys. His production is still unparalleled, spacious, and impossibly textured. His voice is still chilly and metallic, but maintains all its choir boy charm. His music is still towering and menacingly sad. He sings almost exclusively about lost love (“While you were away, I started loving you”), miscommunication (“I’m sorry I don’t know how you feel”), miasma (“I hope my life is no sign of the times”), and defeat (“I want it to be over”). It can be brutal to hear the microscopic variations of themes hammered over and over again, making the album’s pace something between apocalyptic and glacial. Each listen is draining in its way, and when it's over it feels like decades have passed. It can be so self-indulgent and extravagantly sad that it comes close to ruin porn. But it’s worth it. And there are positive messages to eke out of the experience, vitally important ones; that it's all right to be hurt, or alone, that heartbreak helps fuel the flow of life. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As contemporary electronic music moves towards more caustic, crunchy, and self-referential tropes, Blake's music is almost resolutely old fashioned. It deploys auto-tune, expressive (bordering on Platonic) percussion, minimalist pianos, and throwback sub-bass warble and womps. He distills his influences of R&amp;B, gospel, and the wide patina of British dance music in such strange and ineffable concoctions that it makes it difficult to not rewind certain chunks of drum breakdowns and airy synths continually. The melancholic funk of “I Hope My Life (1-800 Mix)” or the dive bomb synth swoops of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18248-james-blake-radio-silence/"">Radio Silence</a>” show Blake’s ability to orchestrate moments that mimic the stark romantic bombast of a Caspar David Friedrich painting.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yet ironically Blake’s own grasp of lyric writing is still immature. He is never clever, catchy, or subtle. If anything he can even be comically melodramatic (“Where is my beautiful life?”) or annoyingly whiny (“I can’t believe that you don’t want to see me”). It makes it so that you wish he would just hum and slur his words into indistinct hunks of emotion. There are also several missteps in how his voice is treated throughout the record. A high pitched vocal processing in “My Willing Heart” is nearly unlistenable. Guest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>'s “hooooo” at the start of “I Need a Forest Fire” is laughable in its wimpy approximation of bravado. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But these flubs are all forgivable. For the most part his singing can be vertiginous, isolating, and induce rapture when stretched into vast choruses. And when he’s alone at the piano, turning off the electronics, Blake approaches the sublime. He may never be able to reproduce the discomfiting beauty of his cover of “A Case of You” but he can still yoke tears from dry eyes in vulnerable songs like “F.O.R.E.V.E.R.” or the album’s title track. In closer ""Meet You in the Maze,"" arguably the album's best song, he abandons instruments all together and sings in a multitudinous acapella that washes away the harrowing experience of the last hour in a rush of catharsis. It’s the closest the album comes to an anthem, and it’s heartwarmingly about self-care, discovery, and acceptance. After the probing self-consciousness that preceded it, these five minutes of fragility feel healing. “It's me who makes the peace in me...Music can't be everything,"" he sings, a moment of pained honesty showing that amidst the grand big-budget drapery of this album, its goals are actually quite modest. At the end of the day Blake just wants to prioritize happiness and self-knowledge above all else. It’s a thoroughly unhip statement that makes you believe smiling, even if it hurts, is the coolest possible thing in the world you can do. </span></p></div>"|21906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21906-the-colour-in-anything/|8.2|Kevin Lozano

The Iowa-born, Montreal-dwelling artist sings in a high, breathy register about fooled hearts and the gift of dance, the flirtatious atmosphere stoked by cheeky guitar and a synth that stutters and slides like a broken zipper. Her 2011 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15338-the-golden-record/"">The Golden Record</a></i>, featured a fair range of guitar-oriented styles—choral post-punk, desert ballads, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7277-horses-30th-anniversary-legacy-edition/"">Horses</a></i>-indebted spirituals—but nothing as pure pop as this.</p>
<p>Rather than a reinvention, though, “Love As a Weapon” is another string to Sprengelmeyer’s considerable bow, and on <i>Cult Following</i>, the wealth of styles—tarnished guitar, midnight-hued synths, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>-indebted balladry—are all pointed in the same direction. To make clear that the record is offering up an alternate reality, the opening interlude is called “Welcome to the Brain,” a spooky riff on the drone of an ensemble tuning up. One song flows into the next, and there are three more interludes across the album’s dozen tracks. Sprengelmeyer brings a similar sense of destination to her individual songs, which rarely end where they started.</p>
<p>On <i>The Golden Record</i>, she tilted towards great booming crescendos. Here, she makes agile and surprising shifts between joy, chaos, and vulnerability in the space of a single track. The centerpiece is “Evan,” a song bookended with its own interludes—an ebullient introduction and a haunted outro—which in turn encompasses all her strengths. It starts out as a gentle lullaby, her voice shoring up the melody until it accrues enough chutzpah to turn into a kind of gospel country song. Then thunder strikes, piercing strings swirl, and her vocal refrain takes on a frenzied intensity. Better still is its dark aftermath, “The Kissing,” where Sprengelmeyer’s soft guitar finds its stakes in clangs of staticky fury, a yowling, borderline-prog solo, followed by a choir’s medicated coos, which linger like fallout.</p>
<p><i>Cult Following</i> is beautifully orchestrated, and one of the rare records where the lavish arrangements feel fully in service of the songs, rather than like stage decoration. (You could sell the record on its guests—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>’s Dessner brothers, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a>’s Kyp Malone, cult Canadian singer Mary Margaret O’Hara—except you can hardly pick them out; they lend their skills rather than personalities.) Sprengelmeyer co-produced with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a>’s Richard Reed Parry, and they make subtle use of panning and scale to swirl the listener right into the world they’ve created, which hits hard without sacrificing on elegance.</p>
<p>In one of the record’s most moving moments, Sprengelmeyer adopts a girlish, scared voice to countenance the possibility of redemption, and of reconciling hurt: “If there are memories I wanna burn/What happens to the ones that I like to keep?” she sings, evoking Bat for Lashes at her most forlorn. “What if my best memories are dreams? Do I get to keep these? Please?” She ends the charade on “Silent Moon,” an eerie, tremulous lament, like Morricone or Angelo Badalamenti arranging for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5009-karen-dalton/"">Karen Dalton</a>: “What I loved in you was just projection/A kind rendering of imperfection,” Sprengelmeyer admits, sadly. “Once I saw what was true/There was not much left of you/I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>The record is fluid, but front-loaded. After “The Kissing,” an eerie, dreamy mood sets in, and the intensity wavers. But while Sprengelmeyer sacrifices the impact of her second record by stacking uncompromising pop songs at the front and dreamier musings towards the back, her story is tantalizingly non-linear and elliptical. <i>Cult Following</i> is a captivating enquiry into the unrelatability of desire, but the conclusiveness of the hurt it can wreak. When it hits, there’s nothing like it.</p></div>"|21861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21861-cult-following/|7.5|Laura Snapes

Sandman has always tackled real issues, but it’s usually been in spurts, packed within unique flows often praised by rap purists. In an era of glossy pop hybrids, the Queens MC is technically precise, a throwback to shell-top Adidas and truck gold chains. “My shit is ever-present,” Sand</span><a href=""http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2014/06/13/homeboy-sandman-will-never-be-on-the-radio-and-hes-fine-with-that/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> once told me</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. “In hip-hop, it’s like it's mandatory to have a specific style.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Midway through his new album, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kindness for Weakness</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the 35-year-old rapper swerves again, opting for spoken-word on “Talking (Bleep),” a squawking funk-jazz hybrid that recalls Miles Davis’ </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10901-the-complete-on-the-corner-sessions/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the Corner</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. With humor and candor, he critiques delusional fans, rude strangers, and even The Huffington Post on the flat-out rant. Historically, Sand’s albums have had some sort of antagonist—</span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/stonesthrow/homeboy-sandman-cops-get-scared"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">cops</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the term “</span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/stonesthrow/homeboy-sandman-musician"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">rapper</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,”</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1lsX4-DL2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> unhealthy foods</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">—but “Talking (Bleep)” is actually a rare vitriolic moment on a record full of soul-searching reflection.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kindness </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">finds the lyricist at peace with himself and his surroundings. He isn’t so combative here; instead, he’s happy with what he has and doesn’t sound so irritated by things he can’t control. “God got reasons for shit that’s gut-wrenching,” he muses on “God.” “I don’t have enemies, God don’t have henchmen.” Sand still captivates lyrically, but on songs like “Heart Sings,” “Eyes,” and “Seam by Seam,” he trades frenetic rhyme patterns for introspective narratives. There’s a creative freedom to this album that comes from years of setbacks and hard work, when you’ve finally found a lane and are content in it. Sidestepping urgent themes, “Earth, Wind, Fire, Water” and “Speak Truth” are simple posse cuts on which rappers </span><a href=""https://yuthe78ermusic.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">yU</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29-aesop-rock/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aesop Rock</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and Shad trade quick bars about nothing in particular. Transitional songs like “Sly Fox” and “Nonbelievers” are breezy and playful, putting Sand’s rhythmic dexterity on full display.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The album feels resolute, though it occasionally suffers from brief lapses that derail the proceedings. “It’s Cold” starts as a gritty ode to New York City nights, but guest vocalist Steve Arrington sounds especially grating. Instrumentals “Gumshoe” and “Funhouse”—produced by </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3581-rjd2/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">RJD2</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ericlaumusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eric Lau</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, respectively—seem random and don’t fit within the LP’s scope. To that end, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kindness</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> feels like a nice collection of songs without a clear direction and it doesn’t have the immediate rewind factor of previous efforts </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16271-homeboy-sandman-subject-matter/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Subject: Matter</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> or </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17074-first-of-a-dying-breed/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First of a Living Breed</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. At this stage of his career, with little left to prove, Sand is making comfortable music that aligns with his place in indie rap. All topics are on the table and clever lyrics are guaranteed. Just don’t box him in.  </span></p></div>"|21863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21863-kindness-for-weakness/|6.7|Marcus J. Moore

More recently, he’s been working as a handyman and commercial painter in his native Minneapolis. Following the release of 2007’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10948-ditherer/"">Ditherer</a></i>, Broder stepped away from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1528-fog/"">Fog</a> moniker for nearly a decade, though he continued to dabble in various side-projects and solo endeavors. With the benefit of distance, Broder is now looking back at his itinerant career, drawing inspiration from his own work and as ever, pushing forward into new terrain. <i>For Good</i> isn’t just a new Fog record—it’s an album where Broder finds his way back to the project’s off-kilter core.</p>
<p>Still, a lot has changed since 2007, not the least of which is Broder himself. On <i>For Good</i>, his vocals are more confident, his darkly impressionistic lyrics sharper, his piano playing playing delicate yet assured. Stepping back from the full-band arrangements of <i>Ditherer</i>, Broder returns to the lone tinkerer ethos that underpinned his early work but with all of his new tricks in tow. <i>For Good</i> essentially feels like the summation of Broder’s wide-ranging career: the loose rhythms of <i>Ditherer</i>, the pop sensibility of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3132-10th-avenue-freakout/"">10th Avenue Freakout</a></i>, the wispy avant-turntablism of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3130-ether-teeth/"">Ether Teeth</a></i>.</p>
<p>In some ways, this is also Broder’s most approachable record yet. Title track ""For Good"" masquerades as a '70s British rock ballad until wobbly percussion and mechanical wheezing subsume the mix completely. ""Kid Kuma"" could easily pass for a <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13384-hail-to-the-thief-special-collectors-edition/"">Hail to the Thief</a></i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a> B-side, with its clattering percussion, rubber-band bassline and a chorus set airborne by Broder's falsetto.</p>
<p>On other songs, though, Broder is as uncompromising as he’s ever been. The record’s midsection is both bleak and sonically confrontational—here Broder lets his experimental side run wild within the constraints of a pop song. ""Cory"" is a claustrophobic nightmare: all oppressive low-end, machine-gun drums and submerged, chopped-up vocals as percussion. ""Crime was always there for you/Crime was always there for me,"" Broder sings during one of the song’s few bright spots. ""Jim"" is driven by a breakbeat that whirrs to life like some terrifying machine: it sounds like the sort of thing Amon Tobin and Scott Walker might cook up together in an abandoned factory full of old industrial equipment. ""Trying"" is a sample-based hip-hop instrumental trapped under a heavy cloak of foreboding, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> if he had co-produced a track for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"">Thom Yorke</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9183-the-eraser/"">The Eraser</a></i>.</p>
<p>Some of the most stunning songs here bridge the gap between Broder’s past and present. Take the penultimate track, ""Made to Follow,"" a gorgeous little hymn that’s punctuated by errant samples of dialog that Broder scratches in and out of the frame. The end result feels like a crisper, higher-fidelity version of Fog circa <i>Ether Teeth</i>, minus the ramshackle scrappiness. Scratching also features prominently on songs like ""Trying"" and ""Sisters Still,"" reminding us of Broder’s turntablist bona-fides while blurring the line between DJ and songwriter.</p>
<p>Most of <i>For Good</i> is already fairly minimal, but album closer ""Father Popcorn"" strips away nearly all ornamentation to zero in on the very essence of Broder’s craft. Like many of these songs, it traces a wandering narrative, nodding toward our new gilded age in its opening (""On a rickshaw ride/racing to the rich part of London at night""), sketching out a scene of Lynchian Americana in its midsection (""Diner counter/Piece of peach pie/Cup of coffee/Wet my fingers"") and settles on a tender vignette of fatherhood, closing with the lines ""Father popcorn/Father popcorn/Make the popcorn."" Musically, it’s one of the most skeletal songs of Broder’s career, consisting of little more than a repeating piano figure, hushed vocals and swells of strings that flutter, hummingbird-like, around the final notes of each bar. Despite its nearly seven minute runtime, the song is consistently engaging throughout, proving how far Broder has come as a songwriter and vocalist.</p>
<p>If there’s a surprise to be found on <i>For Good</i>, its that Broder finally sounds comfortable with his own vision; in his time away from the project, it seems that he was able to reconcile all of the different sounds that Fog has attempted over the years. Despite how sonically adventurous some of these songs are, there’s something almost serene about <i>For Good</i>, especially when considered next to the anxious energy of previous Fog albums. That said, unlike a truly original record like <i>Ether Teeth</i>, <i>For Good</i> is hardly groundbreaking: it’s an album of warped, melancholic indie-pop that slots in nicely next to acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3902-sparklehorse/"">Sparklehorse</a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1300-eels/"">Eels</a>, and Radiohead. That’s hardly a bad thing, even if Fog’s current incarnation is a far cry from its more experimental beginnings. After all, the point of an experiment is to arrive at an answer. Andrew Broder seems to have finally found some.</p></div>"|21852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21852-for-good/|7.0|Mehan Jayasuriya

Layering and looping her often-wordless singing into hypnotic and otherworldly configurations, she enters her songs as though slipping into a stream. The music, she seems to say, precedes us, and it will outlast us; we don't so much carry songs as allow ourselves to be carried along <i>by</i> them, swept up in their current for a little while.</p>
<p>From the beginning, the Louisiana-raised, Brooklyn-based singer has used her voice as a means of stressing a sense of union with forces greater than oneself. It's something she learned growing up singing in church, but also singing alone, ""so lost in it that I would cry,"" as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9182-julianna-barwick/"">she told Pitchfork</a>. Her music joins the massing voices of the congregation with the wordless reverie of aloneness, and that union of togetherness and solitude is a big part of the unique emotional register she achieves. Collapsing oppositions like interior and exterior, self and other, her songs convey the sublimity of being immersed in an unfathomable vastness, of being part of an indivisible whole. Her music is deeply, powerfully emotive, but it doesn't so much express emotions as conjure them; it feels not so much like soaring through clouds as being made one with them.</p>
<p>Her last album, 2013's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18408-julianna-barwick-nepenthe/"">Nepenthe</a></i>, marked a shift from working largely in solitude to collaborating with others: She traveled to Iceland and recorded with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a> producer Alex Somers, along with members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2865-mum/"">Múm</a> and the string quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/253-amiina/"">Amiina</a>. But <i>Will </i>moves in the opposite direction. Recorded in a variety of different places—upstate New York, North Carolina, Lisbon—it highlights Barwick's own voice in simpler configurations. It is a looser, less polished album than <i>Nepenthe</i>, and that rough-around-the-edges intimacy turns out to be a great part of its charm.</p>
<p>If her last album was a journey to the furthest edges of alien realms of sound, the opening song on the new album, ""St. Apolonia,"" grounds us firmly in the here and now, with the distant hum of traffic wreathing her quavering vocal loops. The sumptuous reverb, a regular feature of her work, comes in this instance from architecture, rather than any trick of circuitry or silicon. <i>That's no effects pedal, </i>our ears tell us;<i> that's an overpass</i>. Where once she sang in the hollow of a tree trunk (the magic place referenced on 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15147-the-magic-place/"">The Magic Place</a></i>), here she's wringing music from the hollows of the city, and throughout the album, the reverb around her voice suggests physical space rather than infinity; it's just one of the ways that <i>Will </i>scans as humble and homespun in comparison to <i>Nepenthe</i>'s effortless opulence.</p>
<p>Beyond voice and natural reverb, the most frequently used instruments are reedy, inexpensive-sounding synthesizers and watery piano, the kind you might encounter at a distant relative's beach house—its strings gone faintly out of tune over the long, boarded-up winter. Melodies often feel like they're folding back in upon themselves: Her piano playing ruminates on repeated sequences, lingering on the same few notes and small, simple chords. On ""Wist,"" heavy reverb pulls at her descending lines, blurring her words and tugging them back into the folds of the earth. You can tell that there are words in many of these songs, but the difficulty of teasing out their contours reinforces the impression that this is private music. She doesn't entirely turn her back on those grand, windswept vistas: ""Same,"" with its wailing vocal harmonies and vibrating strings, has a real arms-thrown-wide-open, standing-before-the-void quality to it that contrasts nicely with the muted vibe of the rest of the album. And the closing ""See, Know"" is built around a delightfully incongruous synth lead, easily the most hi-def sound ever to grace one of Barwick's recordings.</p>
<p>Between the piano and the omnipresent hush, the record that <i>Will </i>most resembles is probably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19820-grouper-ruins/"">Ruins</a></i><i> </i>(which, coincidentally, was also recorded in Portugal; the effects of <i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">saudade</a></i> upon visiting musicians are apparently very real). But where Grouper's album was isolationist to the extreme, Barwick's never stops letting in the wider world. The swirling synthesizer loop of ""Nebula,"" almost indistinguishable from a humming voice, recalls the gracefully spinning arpeggios of Meredith Monk's <i><a href=""https://youtu.be/uGKfEAPTrVI?t=1m34s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Book of Days</a></i>; the simplicity of ""Big Hollow"" suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a> at their most demure; the weightless ecstasy of ""Same"" fires up the same pain-and-pleasure centers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4217-this-mortal-coil/"">This Mortal Coil</a>'s version of ""Song to the Siren."" And something about the melody and atmosphere of ""Wist"" even brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>' ethereal ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/90Yfmwwm7oU?t=41m25s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blackmail</a>,"" as though heard resonating through a cistern. It's not that Barwick is imitating these songs, but it's impossible to shake the sense that she is picking up on fragments of a greater melody, a harmonic continuum, a song that belongs to all of us. <i>Will </i>may at first seem small, private, and modestly appointed—just a room with a piano, a synthesizer, and a looping pedal—but once you settle in, it feels as vast as the universe in there.</p></div>"|21782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21782-will/|8.2|Philip Sherburne

He's an engaging singer and performer, but aside from the occasional knob tweak, his backing tracks stream from his laptop and assorted electronic gizmos with little intervention. Where another electronic musician might overcompensate with garish videos, Lange has come up with a curious, low-key solution that is a perfect fit for his curious, low-key music: He's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjwDl1kovAE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">flanked onstage</a> by three figures who don't do much more than sway back and forth, ever so gently, dressed head to toe in tinsel. When your eye wanders from Lange's person, they're there to catch your gaze, reflecting the light like disco balls run through a shredder.</p>
<p>Those mute, cryptic figures make an appearance on <i>Island Universe Story</i><i>: Selected Works</i>: Bits of their tinsel are mixed right into the clear vinyl on which the records are pressed. I like to think of the sparkly strands a little like religious relics, imbued with the aura of each show and each wearer. The unusual presentation suits the album, a condensed edition of Helado Negro's three-volume <i>Island Universe Story </i>cassette series, released between 2012 and 2014. The series is itself unusual. Lange has described its songs, which encompass a variety of experiments and one-off techniques, as a kind of shadow narrative within his catalog—not ""outtakes or afterthoughts or byproducts or B-sides,"" but something ""like the dark side of the moon: always present but… just out of sight.""</p>
<p>Invisibility has always been of special interest to Lange, who was born in Florida to Ecuadorian immigrants and often sings, in Spanish and English, of slipping between worlds. His 2013 album was titled <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17690-helado-negro-invisible-life/"">Invisible Life</a></i>, and there's a song called ""Invisible Heartbeat"" on 2014's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19703-helado-negro-double-youth/"">Double Youth</a></i><i>. </i>On ""We Will You,"" the first song on the new collection, he sings, ""There's a future that doesn't see me."" It's an immediate highlight of the record, with a deep-diving vocoder melody that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/"">Basic Channel</a>'s underwater dub. ""Enfocando"" (""Focusing""), which follows, is another standout, with an odd collection of sounds—harpsichord-like synth melody, reggae-inspired guitar backbeat, jaunty whistling—that he rolls around like a palmful of jewel-toned baubles. ""Enfocando,"" he sings, over and over, in his throaty almost-whisper, allowing each contrapuntal strand to zoom briefly into focus.</p>
<p>One of the stumbling blocks on Helado Negro's last two albums has been their relatively uniform palettes, so it's gratifying to hear him trying out so many different sounds and styles and moods here. Richmond, Virginia's Trey Pollard, a collaborator of Matthew E. White and Natalie Prass, lends watery pedal steel to ""Mitad de Tu Mundo,"" a sort of ambient dub lullaby. ""Stop Living Dead,"" which features Pollard's arrangements for string octet, has something of the dissonant, plastic feel of Arca's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21231-arca-mutant/"">Mutant</a></i>, as the acoustic source material is stretched into strange, synthetic shapes. ""Enters,"" the album's most atypical cut, pairs major-key vocoder with 160-BPM electro rhythms, like a fuzzy Drexciyan daydream. And while most of the album is dominated by Lange's cool voice, which lingers over koan-like statements in a drowsy sing-song cadence, one of the album's most affecting tracks, ""Detroit,"" is a slow-motion electro-funk instrumental where Lange's vocals are limited to background breaths and coos.</p>
<p>Yet <i>Island Universe Story</i> also coheres surprisingly well, given its scattered provenance. As a front to back listen, it may be more satisfying than any of his ""real"" albums. In a text accompanying the first cassette, Lange <a href=""https://heladonegro.bandcamp.com/album/island-universe-story-one"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> of using the tapes to explore ""subconscious whisperings, [a] deep labyrinth of dot-connecting""—a prescient approach, given the way that playlists, in the streaming era, have supposedly supplanted albums as the primary mode of long form listening. In putting together this <i>Island Universe Story</i> collection, Lange has made his own playlist of his subconscious whisperings, and it's the tinsel that serves as the connective tissue between them all.</p></div>"|21783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21783-island-universe-story-selected-works/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

Operating in an outline sketched out by Martin Scorsese and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reasonable Doubt</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the Queens heavyweight pitches himself as a veteran crime boss too deep in the game to change his ways, too flush from the life to take a step back.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sticking to this trusted methodology, Lauren has struggled to separate himself from the pack. The wheezy-voiced rapper often deploys a steady-paced flow that rumbles into view like a packed SUV, his style landing somewhere between NYC legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"">Raekwon</a> and Big Pun, without the former’s eye for detail or latter’s technical complexity. When Meyhem overexerts himself, he sounds like the air can’t back into his lungs fast enough; in his best moments, his gruff vocals hit hard and effectively. He’ll rap blood-soaked confessions with the eerie calm of a guy who isn’t kidding, and his sex stories are cooed like he’s still dragging on that first post-coital cigarette.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">His latest offering </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Piatto D’oro</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is derivative as hell, but it’s still fun to throw on. The sturdy, familiar beats and the no-nonsense hooks—like on the sidewalk-smashing ""Deep Cover"" homage ""Badmon Ting"" and shimmering street anthem ""Elevation""—mostly stick. It’s old school gangster rap appropriation for those who can’t get enough of the familiar stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Money in My Pocket"" lays out Meyhem’s manifesto: ""Lunch at Don Pepe’s, life in rap essays/Top grain leather, we tryna enjoy decades."" Like his frequent collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"">Action Bronson</a>, Meyhem raps about food a whole lot, bragging about eating crab meat ""right out the shell"" on the soul sample-swaddled ""Garlic and Oil"" and his 4am steam fish take-out runs on the tough drums of ""Vintage."" In Mey’s world, the quality on your cuisine is the ultimate status barometer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Though there’s surface-level value to the set, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Piatto D’oro </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">too often wilts under close inspection. Meyhem might take us on a slow drive around his neighborhood, but we never get close enough to the drama. The violent imagery and drug-dealing narratives lack rich specifics, a moralistic center or any sense of a beating heart behind the poker-faced protagonist’s bluster. It’s a widescreen crime flick with a seven-page script.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take the Large Professor-produced ""Not Guilty."" The minimalist beat leaves plenty of space, and would have been a good opportunity for Lauren to delve into his outlaw origin story. Instead, we get more stock similes: ""Breitling on my wrist since I’m 21/Became a man, bought a watch and a gun,"" he spits, passing up chances to dig any deeper. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Bonus Round"" keeps the retro charm ringing, but with a Sega Genesis-jacked sound. Roc Marciano, Action Bronson and Big Body Bes guest as the lean 16-bit pyrotechnics swarm around the squad’s voices. Here, Bronson does with a bar than most rappers need whole verses to lay out: ""Daddy didn’t believe I was an earner/‘Till I showed up in the Lamb with the safari window,"" he raps, connecting the past with the present, and family with his hoodlum life, in just a couple of lines. It’s a reminder that most of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Piatto D’oro</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is all gusto with little underneath. </span></p></div>"|21855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21855-piatto-doro/|6.6|Dean Van Nguyen

His sensibility is </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">theatrical</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in a generous, arresting way, as though his primary prerogative is to clear room on his futon for listeners to safely explore a broad spectrum of common emotions. </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This ethos finds its fullest expression in Cohen’s solo albums. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17165-overgrown-path/"">Overgrown Path</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, his warm, homespun 2012 debut, was a welcoming way to lose track of 33 minutes, a worthy descendent of introspective 1970s singer-songwriter LPs. Four years later, Cohen sounds lost in a different sort of wilderness; </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As If Apart </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">trades the optimism, existential wonder, and woozy jangle of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Overgrown Path </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">for in for heartbreak. The disorienting sting of absence informs lyrics and vocals, while </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Apart </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is pointedly off in a musical sense: every hook shivering near the precipice of melody. Given Cohen’s CV, it can’t be a complete coincidence that this particular vision of splitsville often sounds a lot like an early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"">Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti</a> cassette.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A psychedelic carousel of slow-motion bad cheer, opener ""Torrey Pine"" sets the tone. Fanciful guitar chords circle and dog-pile one another, their colors fading out, every verse seeming to dead-end in the same two words: ""without you."" ""In a Fable"" glances back wistfully at the last days of an acquaintance, while the stark, minimalist ""Sun Has Gone Away"" confronts absence with doubled vocals and echoing pianos. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Single ""Drink from a Silver Cup"" appears to be </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As If Apart</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> at its most engaging until you’ve really </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">heard </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">it.

He can invest light-touch cymbal playing with the feel of pulsing funk. His freer patterns of blast can sound like some of the most refined avant-percussion you've ever heard. Though while DeJohnette is obviously an original, he's not bent on tearing down all the boundaries between jazz sub-genres. His engagement with various aspects of blues and swing flows from an evident reverence for each specific style. Even when pushing his own creative language to new places, DeJohnette manages to keep the inherited forms in view. </p>
<p>His half-century discography suggests how invaluable (and how rare) that philosophy of performance has been. DeJohnette played on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14623-bitches-brew-legacy-edition/"">Bitches Brew</a></i>, was part of an acoustic trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21799-some-other-time-the-lost-session-from-the-black-forest/"">led by pianist Bill Evans</a>, and also collaborated with experimental visionaries from the Chicago scene, many of whom were active in the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (or AACM). In decades since, he's worked with Keith Jarrett and Pat Metheny, while recording frequently as a leader for the ECM label.</p>
<p>DeJohnette's 2015 release on the imprint, <i>Made in Chicago</i>, referenced his deep relationships with various AACM musicians while staying mostly focused on recent compositions from that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/698-the-aacm-collective-turns-50-with-its-radical-creativity-intact/"">all-star group of players</a>. The drummer's latest album follows a broadly similar path, by affording DeJohnette a chance to create some new pieces alongside two scions of jazz: the saxophonist Ravi Coltrane and the bassist (and electronics whiz) Matthew Garrison. The aura of history is inescapable on a project that includes them both, given that their fathers were members of the “classic” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"">John Coltrane</a> Quartet. And DeJohnette's new trio plunges right into the deepest of jazz-legacy waters by tackling one of the classic Coltrane quartet's most iconic tunes, at the very beginning of <i>In Movement</i>.  </p>
<p>“Alabama” was the elder Coltrane's response to the 1963 white-supremacist terror bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church. The studio take is a piece that can stand with any work of tragic poetry, from any artistic discipline. When the climactic tenor line breaks through, there is an emotional transition—from a state of mourning to one of wrenching, cathartic protest. (Spike Lee used this portion of the song to shattering effect during <i>4 Little Girls</i>, his documentary on the murders.) It's one of the great compositions and performances of music history. As a consequence, it's a risky thing for anyone else to touch.</p>
<p>Here, after a few seconds of cymbal work from DeJohnette, the trio's performance begins in earnest when Ravi Coltrane plays a closing portion of the song's main theme. This needle-drop, <i>in media res</i> choice conjures up the haunting suggestion of “Alabama” playing on an everlasting loop, as a mandated accompaniment for each and every occurrence of racially motivated violence. This sense of disquiet is also promoted by Garrison's electric bass playing. His clouds of fuzz-tone thicken noticeably when Coltrane moves up to the famous high-register cry. The purgatorial (or else eternally damned) quality of this “Alabama” feels even even grimmer than the original. There's no swinging, breakdown section (as in the originally issued album version). And even DeJohnette's rollicking percussive moments have a pensive air. Still, the liberties taken here feel well thought-out, while also keeping the performance from seeming backward looking. </p>
<p>The mood brightens considerably during the pair of lengthy (and jointly composed) original tunes that follow “Alabama.” “Two Jimmys” is a joint tribute to Garrison's father as well as Jimi Hendrix, and it has a variable-but-intense groove pitched somewhere between <i>Sun Ship</i> and <i>Band of Gypsys</i>. But the real stomper on <i>In Movement</i> is the trio's Earth, Wind and Fire cover, “Serpentine Fire,” which this trio stretches with abandon. Similarly refashioned is “Blue in Green” from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12283-kind-of-blue-50th-anniversary-edition/"">Kind of Blue</a></i><i>,</i> which finds DeJohnette moving from behind his kit to offer some rich support on piano. Along with two lyrical ballads by DeJohnette, this cover also offers a respite after some of the album's noisier material.</p>
<p>The only cut on the 50-minute set that feels a little too beholden to the past is “Rashied,” a tribute to Coltrane's hookup with drummer Rashied Ali on the duo set <i>Insterstellar Space</i>. It's certainly an energetic performance—and both DeJohnette and Coltrane avoid sounding like they're directly copying the players this piece sets out to honor. But the duo-setup that animates this performance doesn't feel as freshly conceived as the trio's performance of “Alabama” does.</p>
<p> That may sound like a high critical bar, but it's one this group sets for itself. Despite the grand shadows cast by their forbears, <i>In Movement</i> shows how both Ravi and Matthew have emerged as distinct instrumentalists on the contemporary jazz scene. And they have skills that match up with DeJohnette's own. No one in this group has to run from history, or overly fetishize it, in order to sound like an individual—a shared skill that makes <i>In Movement</i> a frequently spellbinding experience.</p></div>"|21817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21817-in-movement/|8.3|Seth Colter Walls

But as listeners dug and listened deeper, the charms of the duo of Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius began to gain their own cult following. Now,  their discography is rightfully regarded as one of the era’s finest. Exploratory yet grounded, futuristic yet melodic, alien and charming, the eight studio albums they recorded from 1971-1981 are now compiled in a handy if no-frills box set. With it, Cluster’s heavenly horizon-to-horizon arc—which spans from the dawn of electronic experimentation to the rise of new age and synthesized pop music—can finally be fully gleaned.</p>
<p>As Asmus Tietchens’s liner notes put it, the group arose from a heady blend of post-war artistic intent: Fluxus, Viennese Actionism, the Frankfurt School, as well as the rise of '60s hippie counter-culture. The group began as Kluster, a three-piece featuring Roedelius, Moebius and fellow synth pioneer Conrad Schnitzler. Seeking to breach boundaries, this incarnation utilized the electronic components of academic composition in ways that moved from high art to all-night happenings. And while Schnitzler exited the group the same year, their 1971 self-titled debut (titled here<b> </b><i>Cluster 71</i>) carries forth that rebellious spirit. Across three long untitled tracks, the unfettered live-wire sound of their early experiments continued on in the studio. While Kraftwerk’s (now-disowned) debut album dates from the year before, it placed electronics alongside organ, flute, drums and violin; <i>Cluster </i><i>71</i> is the buzzing, churning, crackling sound of electricity itself, made audible in all its untamed glory. Its closest peer would be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11847-electronic-meditationalpha-centauri/"">Electronic Meditation</a></i>, but even that album feels more restrained in comparison.</p>
<p>The next year, <i>Cluster</i> <i>II</i> would venture even further into the lightning field. Some numbers, like “Für die Katz',” have a slow cycling guitar line, but circuits spark and simmer on all sides around it, rising and falling like a cardiograph. One of the box set’s meager bonuses is a live concert from this same year. It’s slightly longer here, a shame since these early Cluster shows were usually all-night affairs that rippled and surged for six hours or more, soundtracking chemically altered altered mental flights much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>’s concerts would.</p>
<p>The first two albums fleshed out their obtuse experimental side, and by 1972 the duo moved out of Berlin. They relocated to the rural village of Forst on the river Weser and set up shop in a massive manor that might be regarded as the group's unofficial third member. Bucolic climes altered Cluster's music as much as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, producer Conny Plank or Michael Rother would in the ensuing years. But don't think Forst just inspired mellow idylls; when they released 1974’s <i>Zuckerzeit</i>, it was one of the most audacious about-faces any band had attempted. Rather than the unhurried, unstructured, beatless freeform explorations, <i>Zuckerzeit</i> (which I’ve seen translated as both “Sugar Time” and “Sugar Era”) was electronic pop at its most protean and still acts like a sugar overload: giddy, infectious, manic and a little queasy. The ten tracks belie the fact that the album is two solo halves welded into a whole, each person contributing five tracks and each mapping their musical personas. Utilizing an early analog drum machine, Roedelius's ""Hollywood"" is epic, its shuffling, chugging beat paired with sweeping synths that strafe across the song like eagles, each successive synth layer pushing towards a heart-stirring new summit. Whereas early Cluster albums might have taken an entire side to reach such a climax, now they moved to dizzying heights and back down in a pop song's runtime, anywhere from two to six minutes. Moebius' ""Caramel"" is equally infectious, his lines not as dramatic as his partner's but more kinetic, wiggling in and around the pistoning programmed beat. While Kraftwerk no doubt set the electronic paradigm for the decades to come across numerous genres, the dynamic established between Roedelius and Moebius was also influential. Theirs showed what a sound world two individuals could manifest—expansive yet efficient at once—and it's a dynamic that's powered most electronic music groups ever since, from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">Chemical Brothers</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3170-orbital/"">Orbital</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk </a>and any B2B DJ set. </p>
<p>By the time 1976's <i>Sowiesoso</i> appeared, the effects of rural living were audible on tape. While there's a stiff, rigorous Teutonic aspect to many of krautrock's biggest artists, there's a pliancy and playfulness to Moebius and Roedelius in contrast to the other sounds of the era. Kraftwerk was more formal, Can was more kinetic, Faust more Dadaist, Neu! more manic, leaving Cluster as the most Romantic, and no where does that shine through than on their latter albums, beginning here. Melody, ambience, wistfulness and gentleness underpin songs like "" Zum Wohl"" and the title track. But that doesn't keep weird quirks from arising, like the little drum circle that emerges around the campfire-warm ""Umleitung"" or the drunken lilt of closer “In Ewigkeit.”</p>
<p>Around this time, charmed by both Cluster's output and that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8797-harmonia/"">Harmonia</a> (their trio with Neu!'s Rother), Brian Eno trekked to Forst for two collaborative albums, which no doubt solidified an aesthetic begun with <i>Another Green World</i> that would soon carry over to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>'s Berlin trilogy and Eno's ambient series. And while oblique strategies informed Eno's work during this time, there's a casual tone to <i>Cluster &amp; Eno</i> and <i>After the Heat</i> that suggests neither strategy nor willful obliqueness were needed in the forest. The cover of the former hints at the sounds within, a microphone craning towards the evening sky as if to record drifting clouds. And while one might be inclined to chalk these albums as the work of a trio, producer Conny Plank’s fingerprints are all over these albums, suggesting a quartet at work. The ten tracks are as formless and minutely shifting as that photo suggests, lovely and intangible daydreams.</p>
<p>Elegant piano and twanging guitar entwine on “Ho Renomo” and then drift apart, while pensive piano chords slide across synth flares on ""Wehrmut."" The ambience suggests peacefulness, but there’s always something a little unsettling in these pieces. “Die Bunge” sounds like frog and bird calls from an alien bog, a concept that Eno would revisit for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/""><i>Ambient 4 (</i><i>On Land)</i></a> a few years on. Recorded a few months on, <i>After the Heat</i> kept the open experimentation of the previous encounter intact while edging closer to Eno's sense of song craft. Songs like “Broken Head” and “The Belldog” could have landed on <i>Before and After Science</i>, the lone instances of vocals intruding upon Cluster's otherwise wordless music. There’s more of a pulse to the album, from the brass burbles of “Oil” to Holgar Czukay’s wobbling bass on “Tzima N’Arki,” and fans of Eno’s mid-70s highs will find yet another green world to be had here. </p>
<p>As the decade drew to an end, the synthesizers and drum machines that had once defined the avant garde had increasingly become part of pop music’s fabric. After years of working with Plank, for <i>Großes Wasser</i>, Cluster recorded with Tangerine Dream’s Peter Baumann, finding a sound both darker (“Avanti”), sweeter (the charming etude of “Manchmal”) and funkier (the too-short space-disco of “Prothese”). After years spent exploring shorter times, the title track comprises the entire second side, an epic that touches on Cluster’s tropes from the decade prior: sustained piano chords, strange synth trickles, eerie drones and skeletal drums. By the time of 1981’s <i>Curiosum</i>, British new wavers, new-agers, synth-poppers and industrial miscreants alike had fully embraced Cluster’s examples within their own music, so much so that the miniatures of their last full-length album that decade sound more like Cluster emulating these newer artists (be they OMD, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31808-cabaret-voltaire/"">Cabaret Voltaire</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a>) than the other way around. It still speaks for Cluster’s prescience, to render the mechanistic noise of early electronic devices and warm them up in such a manner so as to reveal that no matter the new technology, such components are ultimately human after all.</p></div>"|21701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21701-cluster-1971-1981/|8.5|Andy Beta

While Kraftwerk’s (now-disowned) debut album dates from the year before, it placed electronics alongside organ, flute, drums and violin; <i>Cluster </i><i>71</i> is the buzzing, churning, crackling sound of electricity itself, made audible in all its untamed glory. Its closest peer would be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11847-electronic-meditationalpha-centauri/"">Electronic Meditation</a></i>, but even that album feels more restrained in comparison.</p>
<p>The next year, <i>Cluster</i> <i>II</i> would venture even further into the lightning field. Some numbers, like “Für die Katz',” have a slow cycling guitar line, but circuits spark and simmer on all sides around it, rising and falling like a cardiograph. One of the box set’s meager bonuses is a live concert from this same year. It’s slightly longer here, a shame since these early Cluster shows were usually all-night affairs that rippled and surged for six hours or more, soundtracking chemically altered altered mental flights much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>’s concerts would.</p>
<p>The first two albums fleshed out their obtuse experimental side, and by 1972 the duo moved out of Berlin. They relocated to the rural village of Forst on the river Weser and set up shop in a massive manor that might be regarded as the group's unofficial third member. Bucolic climes altered Cluster's music as much as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, producer Conny Plank or Michael Rother would in the ensuing years. But don't think Forst just inspired mellow idylls; when they released 1974’s <i>Zuckerzeit</i>, it was one of the most audacious about-faces any band had attempted. Rather than the unhurried, unstructured, beatless freeform explorations, <i>Zuckerzeit</i> (which I’ve seen translated as both “Sugar Time” and “Sugar Era”) was electronic pop at its most protean and still acts like a sugar overload: giddy, infectious, manic and a little queasy. The ten tracks belie the fact that the album is two solo halves welded into a whole, each person contributing five tracks and each mapping their musical personas. Utilizing an early analog drum machine, Roedelius's ""Hollywood"" is epic, its shuffling, chugging beat paired with sweeping synths that strafe across the song like eagles, each successive synth layer pushing towards a heart-stirring new summit. Whereas early Cluster albums might have taken an entire side to reach such a climax, now they moved to dizzying heights and back down in a pop song's runtime, anywhere from two to six minutes. Moebius' ""Caramel"" is equally infectious, his lines not as dramatic as his partner's but more kinetic, wiggling in and around the pistoning programmed beat. While Kraftwerk no doubt set the electronic paradigm for the decades to come across numerous genres, the dynamic established between Roedelius and Moebius was also influential. Theirs showed what a sound world two individuals could manifest—expansive yet efficient at once—and it's a dynamic that's powered most electronic music groups ever since, from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">Chemical Brothers</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3170-orbital/"">Orbital</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk </a>and any B2B DJ set. </p>
<p>By the time 1976's <i>Sowiesoso</i> appeared, the effects of rural living were audible on tape. While there's a stiff, rigorous Teutonic aspect to many of krautrock's biggest artists, there's a pliancy and playfulness to Moebius and Roedelius in contrast to the other sounds of the era. Kraftwerk was more formal, Can was more kinetic, Faust more Dadaist, Neu! more manic, leaving Cluster as the most Romantic, and no where does that shine through than on their latter albums, beginning here. Melody, ambience, wistfulness and gentleness underpin songs like "" Zum Wohl"" and the title track. But that doesn't keep weird quirks from arising, like the little drum circle that emerges around the campfire-warm ""Umleitung"" or the drunken lilt of closer “In Ewigkeit.”</p>
<p>Around this time, charmed by both Cluster's output and that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8797-harmonia/"">Harmonia</a> (their trio with Neu!'s Rother), Brian Eno trekked to Forst for two collaborative albums, which no doubt solidified an aesthetic begun with <i>Another Green World</i> that would soon carry over to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>'s Berlin trilogy and Eno's ambient series. And while oblique strategies informed Eno's work during this time, there's a casual tone to <i>Cluster &amp; Eno</i> and <i>After the Heat</i> that suggests neither strategy nor willful obliqueness were needed in the forest. The cover of the former hints at the sounds within, a microphone craning towards the evening sky as if to record drifting clouds. And while one might be inclined to chalk these albums as the work of a trio, producer Conny Plank’s fingerprints are all over these albums, suggesting a quartet at work. The ten tracks are as formless and minutely shifting as that photo suggests, lovely and intangible daydreams.</p>
<p>Elegant piano and twanging guitar entwine on “Ho Renomo” and then drift apart, while pensive piano chords slide across synth flares on ""Wehrmut."" The ambience suggests peacefulness, but there’s always something a little unsettling in these pieces. “Die Bunge” sounds like frog and bird calls from an alien bog, a concept that Eno would revisit for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/""><i>Ambient 4 (</i><i>On Land)</i></a> a few years on. Recorded a few months on, <i>After the Heat</i> kept the open experimentation of the previous encounter intact while edging closer to Eno's sense of song craft. Songs like “Broken Head” and “The Belldog” could have landed on <i>Before and After Science</i>, the lone instances of vocals intruding upon Cluster's otherwise wordless music. There’s more of a pulse to the album, from the brass burbles of “Oil” to Holgar Czukay’s wobbling bass on “Tzima N’Arki,” and fans of Eno’s mid-70s highs will find yet another green world to be had here. </p>
<p>As the decade drew to an end, the synthesizers and drum machines that had once defined the avant garde had increasingly become part of pop music’s fabric.

But as listeners dug and listened deeper, the charms of the duo of Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius began to gain their own cult following. Now,  their discography is rightfully regarded as one of the era’s finest. Exploratory yet grounded, futuristic yet melodic, alien and charming, the eight studio albums they recorded from 1971-1981 are now compiled in a handy if no-frills box set. With it, Cluster’s heavenly horizon-to-horizon arc—which spans from the dawn of electronic experimentation to the rise of new age and synthesized pop music—can finally be fully gleaned.</p>
<p>As Asmus Tietchens’s liner notes put it, the group arose from a heady blend of post-war artistic intent: Fluxus, Viennese Actionism, the Frankfurt School, as well as the rise of '60s hippie counter-culture. The group began as Kluster, a three-piece featuring Roedelius, Moebius and fellow synth pioneer Conrad Schnitzler. Seeking to breach boundaries, this incarnation utilized the electronic components of academic composition in ways that moved from high art to all-night happenings. And while Schnitzler exited the group the same year, their 1971 self-titled debut (titled here<b> </b><i>Cluster 71</i>) carries forth that rebellious spirit.

But as listeners dug and listened deeper, the charms of the duo of Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius began to gain their own cult following. Now,  their discography is rightfully regarded as one of the era’s finest. Exploratory yet grounded, futuristic yet melodic, alien and charming, the eight studio albums they recorded from 1971-1981 are now compiled in a handy if no-frills box set. With it, Cluster’s heavenly horizon-to-horizon arc—which spans from the dawn of electronic experimentation to the rise of new age and synthesized pop music—can finally be fully gleaned.</p>
<p>As Asmus Tietchens’s liner notes put it, the group arose from a heady blend of post-war artistic intent: Fluxus, Viennese Actionism, the Frankfurt School, as well as the rise of '60s hippie counter-culture. The group began as Kluster, a three-piece featuring Roedelius, Moebius and fellow synth pioneer Conrad Schnitzler. Seeking to breach boundaries, this incarnation utilized the electronic components of academic composition in ways that moved from high art to all-night happenings. And while Schnitzler exited the group the same year, their 1971 self-titled debut (titled here<b> </b><i>Cluster 71</i>) carries forth that rebellious spirit. Across three long untitled tracks, the unfettered live-wire sound of their early experiments continued on in the studio. While Kraftwerk’s (now-disowned) debut album dates from the year before, it placed electronics alongside organ, flute, drums and violin; <i>Cluster </i><i>71</i> is the buzzing, churning, crackling sound of electricity itself, made audible in all its untamed glory. Its closest peer would be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11847-electronic-meditationalpha-centauri/"">Electronic Meditation</a></i>, but even that album feels more restrained in comparison.</p>
<p>The next year, <i>Cluster</i> <i>II</i> would venture even further into the lightning field. Some numbers, like “Für die Katz',” have a slow cycling guitar line, but circuits spark and simmer on all sides around it, rising and falling like a cardiograph. One of the box set’s meager bonuses is a live concert from this same year. It’s slightly longer here, a shame since these early Cluster shows were usually all-night affairs that rippled and surged for six hours or more, soundtracking chemically altered altered mental flights much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>’s concerts would.</p>
<p>The first two albums fleshed out their obtuse experimental side, and by 1972 the duo moved out of Berlin. They relocated to the rural village of Forst on the river Weser and set up shop in a massive manor that might be regarded as the group's unofficial third member. Bucolic climes altered Cluster's music as much as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, producer Conny Plank or Michael Rother would in the ensuing years. But don't think Forst just inspired mellow idylls; when they released 1974’s <i>Zuckerzeit</i>, it was one of the most audacious about-faces any band had attempted. Rather than the unhurried, unstructured, beatless freeform explorations, <i>Zuckerzeit</i> (which I’ve seen translated as both “Sugar Time” and “Sugar Era”) was electronic pop at its most protean and still acts like a sugar overload: giddy, infectious, manic and a little queasy. The ten tracks belie the fact that the album is two solo halves welded into a whole, each person contributing five tracks and each mapping their musical personas. Utilizing an early analog drum machine, Roedelius's ""Hollywood"" is epic, its shuffling, chugging beat paired with sweeping synths that strafe across the song like eagles, each successive synth layer pushing towards a heart-stirring new summit. Whereas early Cluster albums might have taken an entire side to reach such a climax, now they moved to dizzying heights and back down in a pop song's runtime, anywhere from two to six minutes. Moebius' ""Caramel"" is equally infectious, his lines not as dramatic as his partner's but more kinetic, wiggling in and around the pistoning programmed beat. While Kraftwerk no doubt set the electronic paradigm for the decades to come across numerous genres, the dynamic established between Roedelius and Moebius was also influential. Theirs showed what a sound world two individuals could manifest—expansive yet efficient at once—and it's a dynamic that's powered most electronic music groups ever since, from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">Chemical Brothers</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3170-orbital/"">Orbital</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk </a>and any B2B DJ set. </p>
<p>By the time 1976's <i>Sowiesoso</i> appeared, the effects of rural living were audible on tape. While there's a stiff, rigorous Teutonic aspect to many of krautrock's biggest artists, there's a pliancy and playfulness to Moebius and Roedelius in contrast to the other sounds of the era. Kraftwerk was more formal, Can was more kinetic, Faust more Dadaist, Neu! more manic, leaving Cluster as the most Romantic, and no where does that shine through than on their latter albums, beginning here. Melody, ambience, wistfulness and gentleness underpin songs like "" Zum Wohl"" and the title track. But that doesn't keep weird quirks from arising, like the little drum circle that emerges around the campfire-warm ""Umleitung"" or the drunken lilt of closer “In Ewigkeit.”</p>
<p>Around this time, charmed by both Cluster's output and that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8797-harmonia/"">Harmonia</a> (their trio with Neu!'s Rother), Brian Eno trekked to Forst for two collaborative albums, which no doubt solidified an aesthetic begun with <i>Another Green World</i> that would soon carry over to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>'s Berlin trilogy and Eno's ambient series. And while oblique strategies informed Eno's work during this time, there's a casual tone to <i>Cluster &amp; Eno</i> and <i>After the Heat</i> that suggests neither strategy nor willful obliqueness were needed in the forest. The cover of the former hints at the sounds within, a microphone craning towards the evening sky as if to record drifting clouds. And while one might be inclined to chalk these albums as the work of a trio, producer Conny Plank’s fingerprints are all over these albums, suggesting a quartet at work. The ten tracks are as formless and minutely shifting as that photo suggests, lovely and intangible daydreams.</p>
<p>Elegant piano and twanging guitar entwine on “Ho Renomo” and then drift apart, while pensive piano chords slide across synth flares on ""Wehrmut."" The ambience suggests peacefulness, but there’s always something a little unsettling in these pieces. “Die Bunge” sounds like frog and bird calls from an alien bog, a concept that Eno would revisit for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/""><i>Ambient 4 (</i><i>On Land)</i></a> a few years on. Recorded a few months on, <i>After the Heat</i> kept the open experimentation of the previous encounter intact while edging closer to Eno's sense of song craft. Songs like “Broken Head” and “The Belldog” could have landed on <i>Before and After Science</i>, the lone instances of vocals intruding upon Cluster's otherwise wordless music. There’s more of a pulse to the album, from the brass burbles of “Oil” to Holgar Czukay’s wobbling bass on “Tzima N’Arki,” and fans of Eno’s mid-70s highs will find yet another green world to be had here. </p>
<p>As the decade drew to an end, the synthesizers and drum machines that had once defined the avant garde had increasingly become part of pop music’s fabric. After years of working with Plank, for <i>Großes Wasser</i>, Cluster recorded with Tangerine Dream’s Peter Baumann, finding a sound both darker (“Avanti”), sweeter (the charming etude of “Manchmal”) and funkier (the too-short space-disco of “Prothese”). After years spent exploring shorter times, the title track comprises the entire second side, an epic that touches on Cluster’s tropes from the decade prior: sustained piano chords, strange synth trickles, eerie drones and skeletal drums. By the time of 1981’s <i>Curiosum</i>, British new wavers, new-agers, synth-poppers and industrial miscreants alike had fully embraced Cluster’s examples within their own music, so much so that the miniatures of their last full-length album that decade sound more like Cluster emulating these newer artists (be they OMD, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31808-cabaret-voltaire/"">Cabaret Voltaire</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a>) than the other way around.

For the most part, the revival foregrounded the era’s headiest rock bands and no doubt appealed to classic rock fans looking for new thrills: Can, Neu!, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/198-amon-duul/"">Amon Düül I</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/82-amon-duul-ii/"">II</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1467-faust/"">Faust</a> and the like. And while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> already enjoyed success in the worlds of early hip-hop, electro and industrial circles at this time, a purely electronic act like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> went unnoticed for the most part. But as listeners dug and listened deeper, the charms of the duo of Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius began to gain their own cult following. Now,  their discography is rightfully regarded as one of the era’s finest. Exploratory yet grounded, futuristic yet melodic, alien and charming, the eight studio albums they recorded from 1971-1981 are now compiled in a handy if no-frills box set. With it, Cluster’s heavenly horizon-to-horizon arc—which spans from the dawn of electronic experimentation to the rise of new age and synthesized pop music—can finally be fully gleaned.</p>
<p>As Asmus Tietchens’s liner notes put it, the group arose from a heady blend of post-war artistic intent: Fluxus, Viennese Actionism, the Frankfurt School, as well as the rise of '60s hippie counter-culture. The group began as Kluster, a three-piece featuring Roedelius, Moebius and fellow synth pioneer Conrad Schnitzler. Seeking to breach boundaries, this incarnation utilized the electronic components of academic composition in ways that moved from high art to all-night happenings. And while Schnitzler exited the group the same year, their 1971 self-titled debut (titled here<b> </b><i>Cluster 71</i>) carries forth that rebellious spirit. Across three long untitled tracks, the unfettered live-wire sound of their early experiments continued on in the studio. While Kraftwerk’s (now-disowned) debut album dates from the year before, it placed electronics alongside organ, flute, drums and violin; <i>Cluster </i><i>71</i> is the buzzing, churning, crackling sound of electricity itself, made audible in all its untamed glory. Its closest peer would be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11847-electronic-meditationalpha-centauri/"">Electronic Meditation</a></i>, but even that album feels more restrained in comparison.</p>
<p>The next year, <i>Cluster</i> <i>II</i> would venture even further into the lightning field. Some numbers, like “Für die Katz',” have a slow cycling guitar line, but circuits spark and simmer on all sides around it, rising and falling like a cardiograph. One of the box set’s meager bonuses is a live concert from this same year. It’s slightly longer here, a shame since these early Cluster shows were usually all-night affairs that rippled and surged for six hours or more, soundtracking chemically altered altered mental flights much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>’s concerts would.</p>
<p>The first two albums fleshed out their obtuse experimental side, and by 1972 the duo moved out of Berlin. They relocated to the rural village of Forst on the river Weser and set up shop in a massive manor that might be regarded as the group's unofficial third member. Bucolic climes altered Cluster's music as much as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, producer Conny Plank or Michael Rother would in the ensuing years. But don't think Forst just inspired mellow idylls; when they released 1974’s <i>Zuckerzeit</i>, it was one of the most audacious about-faces any band had attempted. Rather than the unhurried, unstructured, beatless freeform explorations, <i>Zuckerzeit</i> (which I’ve seen translated as both “Sugar Time” and “Sugar Era”) was electronic pop at its most protean and still acts like a sugar overload: giddy, infectious, manic and a little queasy. The ten tracks belie the fact that the album is two solo halves welded into a whole, each person contributing five tracks and each mapping their musical personas. Utilizing an early analog drum machine, Roedelius's ""Hollywood"" is epic, its shuffling, chugging beat paired with sweeping synths that strafe across the song like eagles, each successive synth layer pushing towards a heart-stirring new summit. Whereas early Cluster albums might have taken an entire side to reach such a climax, now they moved to dizzying heights and back down in a pop song's runtime, anywhere from two to six minutes. Moebius' ""Caramel"" is equally infectious, his lines not as dramatic as his partner's but more kinetic, wiggling in and around the pistoning programmed beat. While Kraftwerk no doubt set the electronic paradigm for the decades to come across numerous genres, the dynamic established between Roedelius and Moebius was also influential. Theirs showed what a sound world two individuals could manifest—expansive yet efficient at once—and it's a dynamic that's powered most electronic music groups ever since, from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">Chemical Brothers</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3170-orbital/"">Orbital</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk </a>and any B2B DJ set. </p>

While there's a stiff, rigorous Teutonic aspect to many of krautrock's biggest artists, there's a pliancy and playfulness to Moebius and Roedelius in contrast to the other sounds of the era.

Like most teens, protagonist Aly has a heart that’s outgrown her sense of identity. <i>Really </i>like most teens, she spends all her time online – specifically, on the titular online MMORPG, which doesn’t have all that many discernible MMORPG elements but is at least populated by the usual wacky sorts, only a few of which are obviously inspired by Tim Burton’s versions of themselves in 2010. In the role of Boomer sneering at millennials and their screens we have Aly’s technophobic Miss Hannigan of a headmaster, though she’s not exasperated enough that she can’t steal Aly’s avatar and turn herself into the Red Queen, the resident wonder.land shitposter.</p>
<p>There are, right from the outset, a number of ways this could go wrong. There is no genre or medium in existence in which a version, straight or tweaked, of <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>is not clichéd. (Last down the rabbit hole in the theater world was <i>Jekyll and Hyde </i>director Frank Wildhorn, whose 2011 <i>Alice </i>adaptation flopped mightily.) And a lightly tweaked musical take on fairy tales in general is a Broadway standby—see Sondheim’s <i>Into the Woods</i>, whose high-profile film adaptation would bring it first to mind even if its Broadway revival and canonical status didn’t. Making one’s fairytale world a MMORPG was dated somewhere around the heyday of Second Life, if not the Ultima Online or BBS eras; equating that digital world with Wonderland was dated when <i>The Matrix </i>did it; and titles like “wonder.land” became <i>hilariously </i>dated somewhere around 2000, the year of “<a href=""http://www.nevergetoveryou"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nevergetoveryou</a>.” And Albarn, though not new to theater scores—2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16585-damon-albarn-dr-dee/"">Dr. Dee</a> </i>is pleasantly complex and holds up remarkably well as a standalone work – is a curious choice for this one, being neither a fan of modern musicals (which “<a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-33343078"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lack identity musically</a>”) nor, perhaps digital culture (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19280-damon-albarn-everyday-robots/"">Everyday Robots</a></i> in particular betrays some Luddite tendencies). Could the man whose last solo single lamented the rise of “everyday robots on [their] phones” really bring this digital wonderland to life?</p>
<p>As it turns out Albarn’s <i>wonder.land </i>score is perfectly fine, which is the entire problem. Buffini described her vision for the score as a blend of electronic music and music hall, but the electronic elements are minimal (this is no PC Music, nor even Owl City) and the vaudeville elements are unsurprising; a better description might be “a middling Amanda Palmer side project.” The score dutifully shuffles from pop ballads to vaguely creepy variety show numbers without much consistency or identity musically. The individual songs aren’t even consistent about how good they are. “Me” would be a perfectly serviceable loopy-soprano character piece with a few just-off-enough lyrics (“like a toenail all ingrown”) were it not backed by the sort of breezy ukulele soft-rock that’s the bane of anyone's existence who has watched a commercial in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>“I’m Right” is supposed to be the kind of villainous patter song that, with the right performer, steals shows, but both arrangement and lyric are clunky and over-practiced; it’s as if the headmaster who performs it rapped her cane to silence the cast every time she suspected things might be getting fun. (The character songs are particularly weak, which for a work like <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>is death; Tweedledee, Tweedledum, the Dormouse, and the Mock Turtle are shuffled through in one not-particularly-memorable song, which may be intended as a quick-cut take on the megapopulation of online spaces but comes off more as songwriting-by-checklist.) There <i>is</i> fun in the title track, a bit of female-fronted power-pop that’s among the more failure-proof styles out there – that is, unless it loses all its energy from stage to recording and, more damningly, punctuates every other riff with the worst-aging part of the book, namely: DOUBLE-YOU-DOUBLE-YOU-DOUBLE-YOU-DOT-WONDER-DOT-LAND! This is supposed to get silly with repetition. It just maybe wasn’t supposed to sound so silly from go.</p>
<p>The biggest downfall of <i>wonder.land</i>, ultimately, isn’t anything in particular it does, but everything it doesn’t. An early draft of the musical was set in North Korea, which is a horrible idea, but at least an <i>interesting </i>horrible idea. Very little in <i>wonder.land </i>is interesting, and what is comes mostly from the book and the concept. (The theatrical production’s gotten middling reviews, but unlike, say, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21122-hamilton-original-broadway-cast-recording/"">Hamilton</a></i>, even the positive reviews rarely praise the score.) Perhaps they wrung some originality out of the material after all; <i>Alice </i>has been done for children, for teens, for adults, squeaky-clean to drugged-out, lighthearted to dark and darker and darkest, but seldom has it been done so bland.</p></div>"|21854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21854-songs-from-wonderland/|5.0|Katherine St. Asaph

Unfortunately, she couldn't shake the couple's penchant for covers. <i>Luck or Magic</i> totals 10 tracks and half are Phillips' interpretations of other people's work. This move winds up feeling like album filler, despite the offbeat quirkiness of her picks. (A cover of Agnetha Fältskog's ""Wrap Your Arms Around Me"" is a highlight. When's the last time you listened to that song and remembered how great it is?) Ultimately, the covers feel more like a security blanket than a homage, as if Phillips couldn't quite trust her own work to make the cut.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Truly, it's her sweet voice that suffers the consequences. She has a honeyed touch that can be as soothing as it is airy and bright, even when the songs are tinged with tragedy—think ""The Sun Is Still Sunny."" Now, her vocals have been run through the same flat, echo effect that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a> seems to live inside. Nowhere is this comparison more apparent than on the album's opener ""Daydream."" It becomes quite easy to swap out Phillips for Del Rey in your mind, minus Del Rey's pouty affect. Similar vocal effects are applied to the cover of ""Fallin' In Love,"" written by Dennis Wilson and originally titled ""Lady."" Phillips plays it safe and willfully changes the song's subject by replacing ""lady"" with ""baby,"" which comes off as cutesy and trite, negating her ability to take a deep dive into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">Beach Boys</a>' catalog and make an offbeat selection. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sadly, that's not the album's worst transgression when it comes to tapering with originals. She opens her cover of ""Landslide"" with a cheerful, bubbly synth line, dubs in a child's voice right before the line ""Can the child in my heart rise above?,"" and adds electric guitar solos so out of place they're just downright bizarre. If you're going to tackle Stevie Nicks, it's best not to rob her work of its emotional power by pummeling the song with unnecessary flourishes. Not to mention, the world needs another ""Landslide"" cover like it needs another version of Cohen's ""Hallelujah.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">It's not as if the album is devoid of its bright spots. ""Do It Last"" is pleasant enough to listen to. ""Million Dollar Doll"" is catchy. The cover of ""One Fine Summer Morning"" is perfectly lovely because Phillips sticks close to the original, which is a relief. The slowed-down version of ""Drive"" is also well-suited to the tone of her voice and worth a listen. But all in all, the sparks are overshadowed by poor choices and general lack of direction. Phillips recently told <i><a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/04/25/listen-to-britta-phillipss-debut-solo-album-luck-or-magic-exclusive/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">The Wall Street Journal</span></a></i> that producer Erik Broucek kept the album from ""sound[ing] like a random playlist,"" when in fact that's exactly how it ends up sounding.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It would be nice to see her trust herself more and cut down on the plethora of embellishments. Phillips can stand on her own, her talent will support her. (She was <a href=""https://youtu.be/b6NBQeGQWXk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">Jem</span></a> for God's sake!) But the ability to make decent music doesn't need to rely on a rabbit's foot, or a stroke of good fortune, or mimicry. It does, however, tend to require a belief in oneself. A continued search for <i>Luck or Magic</i> probably isn't going to be very fruitful when what you really need is confidence. </span></p></div>"|21856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21856-luck-or-magic/|5.0|Lindsay Hood

So many have aimed for simple and landed on trite; aimed for timeless and landed on toothless; aimed for sweet and landed on creepy. This is precisely why most power-pop albums are not necessarily graded for breaking new ground, but rather, for how competently they fit within the genre’s pre-established formula. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beloved</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the debut album from Portland, OR songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33716-mo-troper/"">Mo Troper</a>, indeed recalls some important figures from the past. Over the course of its thirteen tracks, you will find the blushing-schoolboy narratives from the first two <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a> records, the denim-clad rock bravado of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4181-teenage-fanclub/"">Teenage Fanclub</a>, and the lo-fi spontaneity of '90s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3353-robert-pollard/"">Robert Pollard</a>. And while these reference points might account for some of the album’s initial thrill, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beloved </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">seeks to do more than just impress you with its immaculate Works Cited page.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In fact, it’s almost impressive how much Troper is able to wring not only out of his genre’s limitations but also his stunted lyrical inspiration. Nearly all his songs are planted firmly within either accusatory pop-punk juvenilia (“You’re just another human being/But you’re the only one who’s cool enough to be a casualty/Of everything”) or starry-eyed high school fantasy (“Do you want to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">kiss</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> me?/Do you ever say my name out loud?”). The latter lyric—from “After the Movies,” the album’s obvious highpoint—is a lot more successful territory for Troper, whose voice is significantly more attractive beneath that song’s cozy distortion than amid the awkward open-mic dryness of “Somebody Special.” On an album that, at its best, sounds like an unearthed live bootleg from an obscure Titan Records band, moments like these can’t help but feel like the local openers coming back to play one more song: you can practically hear the audience hightailing it to the bathroom within the first fifteen seconds. Same goes for eight-minute slow burner “The Biggest” and its acoustic coda, “Teeth,” both of which seem to exist solely for the purpose of pushing the album’s runtime past the thirty-minute mark.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As spotty as the album is, Troper’s gifts are undeniable. “Judy Garland” employs a lyrical conceit not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>’s “Buddy Holly” before breaking into a similarly infectious “Ooh ooh ooh” refrain, ensuring the song takes a permanent place in your head. On “Star Wars,” Troper plays up his loner persona (“All my friends want to get drunk again/I just want to stay home and stare at my phone”) before admitting squarely, “All my friends are total fucking </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">bros</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.” It’s one of the album’s funnier moments, not to mention one that plants his material firmly in the present, as opposed to the unremembered golden age his melodies and production occasionally recall. Plus, it’s nice for once to hear him slightly implicate himself in his trademark, snot-nosed pwnage.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s hard to say just how long Troper’s keen melodic sensibility can counterbalance his lyrics’ occasionally mean-spirited adolescent tone; it will be interesting to see whether or not he will be able to pass the ultimate test for power-pop artists—the dreaded sophomore album. Still, in a genre often criticized for its timidity, Troper gets points for confidence. Not to mention, it’s easy to ignore what he’s actually saying in songs like “After the Movies” and “Paint,” in which nearly every couplet feels effortlessly like a hook. While Troper is not the first person to do what he’s doing, he is the first in a long time who can convince you—for the length of a few perfect moments—that no one’s ever done it better. If he’s half as interested in taking advice as he is in giving it, he’s well on his way to earning the authority that these songs seem obsessed with obtaining.</span></p></div>"|21905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21905-beloved/|6.0|Sam Sodomsky

""We'll celebrate breaking even after every single [self-booked] tour,"" frontwoman Mish Barber-Way <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/billy-corgan-and-mainstream-rebellion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> prior to the release of their second album, 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16897-sorry/"">Sorry</a></i>. ""And that's totally okay with me."" With <i>Paradise</i>, their fourth, they've talked about exploring a new pop sensibility, <a href=""http://whitelung.ca/bio/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">versus</a> ""this really stupid attitude that only punks have where it's somehow uncool to become a better songwriter."" Barber-Way took singing lessons; they embraced ""accessible."" None of which, thankfully, has pared down Kenneth William's tar-spitting guitars, Anne-Marie Vassiliou's breakneck drumming, or their powerslide dynamic.</p>
<p>If anything, there's more of a spotlight on those things now. Over time, the Canadian thrashers have increasingly allowed space to let the pop potential of their songs shine through. After the sparking Catherine wheel sound of their last album, 2014's excellent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19460-white-lung-deep-fantasy/"">Deep Fantasy</a></i>, and its predecessors, the production on <i>Paradise </i>is roomy by comparison; convincingly stadium-sized, and billowing with dry ice, a touch indebted to pop's cavernous post-<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Lillywhite"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Lillywhite</a> moment. Having ruined her voice on the <i>Deep Fantasy</i> tour, Barber-Way now sings at a gothy remove rather than a throat-mangling shred. ""Narcoleptic"" chimes with dark, glassy synth-like guitars, and in ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18015-white-lung-hungry/"">Hungry</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18219-white-lung-below/"">Below</a>,"" they've written two genuinely affecting power ballads that don't scrimp on attack or scream-'til-it-hurts hooks.</p>
<p>On <i>Deep Fantasy</i>, Barber-Way tackled body dysmorphia and addiction, and wrote bracing indictments of rape culture and the violent and insidious ways it affects society, from outright assault (""I Believe You"") to the ongoing fear of getting your drink spiked in a club (""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16963-white-lung-down-it-goes/"">Down It Goes</a>""). Unsurprisingly, it was often labeled a ""feminist punk record."" Which it was—and an important one, too—but however many years on we are from feminism's big mainstream moment, the term has become a suffocating expectation of art made by women: that <i>honoring the sisterhood</i> must surely be their only intention, that their politics <i>are</i> their identity, rather than the other way around, and should they make any move deemed <i>un-</i>feminist, they better line up at the nearest Twitter stake post-haste. White Lung are never a band to follow expectations, and Barber-Way has always expressed disdain for the concept of a singular feminism. As if to celebrate that, on <i>Paradise</i>, she follows the lead of an artist who initially confounded her own ideas of female power and agency.</p>
<p>In 2014, Barber-Way <a href=""thetalkhouse.com/mish-way-white-lung-talks-lana-del-reys-ultraviolence/"">grappled with her appreciation</a> of Lana Del Rey's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19449-lana-del-rey-ultraviolence/"">Ultraviolence</a></i> in a review for the Talkhouse. At first, she wrote, she had to separate the ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12276-video-games/"">Video Games</a>"" singer from her art because she found her ""annoying."" But over repeated listens, Barber-Way arrived at a revelation: ""LDR is always searching for herself through someone else and sometimes she hits the mark and embodies the character perfectly."" On <i>Paradise </i>(coincidentally or not<i>,</i> also <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_(Lana_Del_Rey_EP)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the name of an EP</a> by LDR), Barber-Way, who is now based in Los Angeles, shifts between her own perspective and various other female points of view, all of which offer provocative challenges to the idea of what it means to be a Good Feminist.</p>
<p>In one sense, it's a writing exercise: As a journalist in her own right, she's often written about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/9399-white-lung/"">marrying</a> a ""motorcycle-riding, Southern-born hick from Arkansas,"" and that she'd like little more than to abandon her career and escape to the country with him. It's a prospect she says is considered ""grossly basic"" in her punk peer group—and a happy one that ""doesn't make for the best songwriting."" But the one spot on <i>Paradise</i> where she tries it explicitly is awesome: It's the subject of the title track, a ride-or-die pounder with a killer chorus where she yearns for her husband to ""ride south with me now."" She sneers, ""I'm all about you/You're all about me too,"" before asking anyone who cares to challenge her dream, ""Oh, is that oppressive? No."" A couple of songs seem to deal with getting over the addictions that she's mentioned in the past; what is <i>Paradise</i> if not exerting control over a totally personal environment?</p>
<p>Among Barber-Way's characters are two real-life serial killers. On ""Sister,"" she sings as Karla Homolka, the wife of Paul Bernardo, who at the end of the 1980s became known as the ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bernardo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ken and Barbie killers</a>"" thanks to a spree of murders in Scarborough, Canada—including Homolka's sister, Tammy. ""You'll burn a bit/My little sister,"" Barber-Way sings, over intricate, trebly guitar. On ""Demented"" Barber-Way imagines a fight between British serial killers <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_West"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rosemary and Fred West</a> over their mutually assured destruction, echoed by what sounds like a wall of death race around the tip of a volcano. These songs are schlocky, but they serve as part of a deeper inquiry into how we perceive and attribute female desire and agency—female serial killers get shorter sentences than their male equivalents, because it's harder for anyone to believe they'd do it.</p>
<p>Barber-Way has called the sharp-edged ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18147-white-lung-kiss-me-when-i-bleed/"">Kiss Me When I Bleed</a>,"" whose chorus feels like mudsliding through a ring of fire, her riches-to-rags white-trash fairytale. ""I will give birth in a trailer,"" she whines with stubborn pride, singing as a girl caught up with what her family think is the wrong kinda guy. This isn't about bullshit ""choice feminism"" or ""empowerment,"" but offers a demanding characterization of the battles Barber-Way waged with herself over her own decisions, and one that asks that we examine our own responses: Do we sneer? Why?</p>
<p>Barber-Way wastes no time dismantling the traditional yardsticks of female worth, the rigged games of beauty (""Below"") and fame (""Hungry""), and the Republican-endorsed concept of female bodies as pliant reproductive vessels. ""Spare your good seed,"" she laments in a layered, robotic yowl on the hyper-speed ""Dead Weight,"" ""I'm getting bored and old."" <i>Deep Fantasy</i> screamed itself black and blue fighting back against a culture of oppression. On <i>Paradise</i>, Barber-Way steps outside of her own body and the assaults it sustains, and creates a searing portrait of what it can look like to love without fear, even when that love doesn't resemble the fantasy we've been sold.</p></div>"|21849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21849-paradise/|8.4|Laura Snapes

Here you can be what you want to be. We’re carrying on where the '60s left off. We put jelly on the floor and ask people to eat it. The fact that they do shows that there is still hope for the world."" These are the words of the Doctor, a glammed-up, pylon-haired oddball, speaking to the UK’s <i>Observer</i> magazine in 1981. The Doctor’s heady proclamations, made in the wake of punk and postpunk and at the dawn of Thatcherism, were typical of an idealistic new movement rooted in the mod revival. It antagonized both dreary realists, who were unforgivably bland, and the reigning New Romantics, whose pop-futurist stylings were considered elitist and played-out, stuck in front of the bedroom mirror. New Psychedelia, fomented<b><i> </i></b>in early-80s England, peered instead into the kaleidoscope of psych-rock—13th Floor Elevators, Traffic, the <i>Nuggets</i> compilations—and saw something momentarily more appealing.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>A Splash of Colour</i>, originally released as a 13-track LP in '81, documented the scattershot fruits of that vision, just as it began to spread beyond clubs and second-hand clothes stores in London’s Soho and Kensington. Reissued as <i>Another Splash of Colour</i>, the set has now expanded to three discs, comprising 64 songs recorded between '80 and '85. Ancestors of glammy Britpop, nerdy twee pop, playful college rock, and prime-era Creation Records rub shoulders, jostling for attention as each song pulls the rug from under the last.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">What connects the groups is their investment in a collective, '60s-themed imaginarium, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1956-robyn-hitchcock/"">Robyn Hitchcock</a>’s inspired nonsense (""It’s a Mystic Trip"") to the straight-faced period pieces of groups like Pink Umbrellas (""Raspberry Rainbow""). Though genre revivalism was hardly novel, New Psychedelia—which, besides this compilation, left few footprints in the British underground—was the first scene since punk to observe the widespread rejection of '60s Britrock, and to reject that rejection<i>. </i>Thanks in part to the ""second Cold War,"" as well as the severity of Margaret Thatcher’s conservative politics, many would-be dissidents had drifted into a state of woozy social escapism<i>.</i> That musical response, writes one-time <i>NME</i> scribe Neil Taylor in <i>Another Splash of Colour</i>’s liner notes, ""made a curious contrast, as the inimitable Dan Treacy was to later point out on 'She Was Only a Grocer’s Daughter': 'Relax your mind and float downstream/Pretend it’s all a very bad dream.'""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For New Psychedelia’s frontmen (and it’s curious to note that no group represented here had a frontwoman), those bad dreams were a creative goldmine. The compilation’s second track, ""Just Like a Dream"" by the High Tide, is a grim fantasy of nuclear apocalypse. It’s joined by escapist head-ventures from the Marble Staircase (""Still Dreaming""), Treacy’s TV Personalities (""The Dream Inspires""), and Naz Nomad &amp; the Nightmares, who cover the Electric Prunes’ ""I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)."" Rather than dream up a new world, the artists were scavenging and inhabiting the recent past—in this case the late '60s, already established as the unimpeachable golden age—because they considered their copious imagination an end in itself, rather than a weapon. Like their siblings in twee pop, the scene’s aggrieved youngsters saw no contradiction in protesting neoliberalist austerity by reviving the '60s idealism that failed to prevent it.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There’s much to enjoy in the free-spirited music that impulse wrought, even if it proved a bit of a dead-end. ""Just 'cos the blank generation blew it/Don’t mean we have to,"" is a typically feisty missive from Miles Over Matter, whose kaleidoscopic ""Something’s Happening Here"" is the record’s closest thing to a manifesto. The Barracudas, who applied their psych fripperies and lyrical polemic more sparingly, contribute a neat, jangly anthem called ""Watching the World Go By,"" which rallies disenchanted dreamers who believe ""The world is just too crazy"" and who ""prefer being left behind."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30013-cleaners-from-venus/"">Cleaners From Venus</a>, led by the great Martin Newell, offer ""Wivenhoe Bells II,"" a more pastoral and poetic social commentary that could slide onto <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4685-xtc/"">XTC</a>’s <i>Skylarking</i>, with a reverb-heavy, alienated vocal that clambers over tumbling arrangements, like a child across beach rocks.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While wimpy eccentrics characterized the scene, the highlights here are diffuse. The militant urgency of Blue Orchids’ ""Work,"" a hit on John Peel’s radio show, isn’t far off that of the group’s transatlantic contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2906-mission-of-burma/"">Mission of Burma</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4610-wipers/"">the Wipers</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16147-the-soft-boys/"">The Soft Boys</a>' ""Only the Stones Remain"" and Julian Cope’s brilliantly haughty ""Sunspots"" are neo-psych heavyweights that have swaggered through the decades, while Glasgow band the Chicanes, on ""Further Thoughts,"" identify and triangulate the best bits of all of it, corralling dingy postpunk, breezy Postcard pop, psych mystique, and post-hardcore dissonance into something surprisingly forward-facing.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In fact, listening through the comp, there’s a sense New Psychedelia’s weak link was maybe the psychedelia: When <i>Another Splash of Colour</i> drags, it’s thanks to emboldened hammer-ons, zealous chorus pedals, or stray jam passages—many of the fineries that another psych descendant, the shoegaze scene, ditched a few years later. Still, the cluttered, trove-like format suits the record. As is customary for sprawling retrospectives, listeners enter an unspoken pact in which they’ll persevere with, say, Firmament &amp; the Elements’ ""The Festival of Frothy Muggament"" (sample lyric: ""We played and they paid/And was it good?/Mmm, yay, verily, it was good"") because forays into absurd theatricality are part and parcel of any scene sustained by LSD-fuelled boat parties and a fondness for shirts with Edwardian frills. Not only does the record’s scrappy, lived-in ambiance reflect the DIY necessities of that scene—it creates an intimate, densely packed time-capsule, in which strange aromas have mingled until even the minor curios are a source of wonder.</span></p></div>"|21860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21860-another-splash-of-colour-new-psychedelia-in-britain-1980-1985/|7.2|Jazz Monroe

The Philadelphia four-piece has, since its inception, been compared endlessly to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23607-voivod/"">Voivod</a> (thanks in no small part to their nearly identical logo, made even more conspicuous <a href=""http://i2.wp.com/www.toiletovhell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1933926_10153276941171821_9160421945952492914_n.png?resize=960%2C355"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">when placed side-by-side on a tour poster</a>), but there’s always been more to their music than pure '80s revivalism. Of course, there’s plenty of that – particularly on their crushing debut <i>Black Future</i>. But, on their 2011 follow-up <i>Outer Isolation</i>, Vektor garnished their speedy, pummeling metal with proggier flirtations: lengthy, knotty compositions about space and alternate universes. <i>Terminal Redux</i>, their third and finest album, takes the band’s cerebral tendencies to the next level: over the course of the album’s ten songs, vocalist and guitarist David DiSanto tells the fairly elaborate story of a military general astronaut who rises to political power among the intergalactic Cygnus regime after finding an interstellar mineral that just might be the key to immortality. Even if you choose to ignore a few minor plot points, <i>Terminal Redux</i> stands as one of the most thrilling, forward-thinking metal albums of the year: one that should finally shed any remaining detractors who find the band’s music to be at all derivative.</p>
<p> In the first track alone, Vektor manages to invoke something like an entire discography's worth of ideas. Ranging from black metal riffage to harmonic chanting to an anthemic closing guitar solo straight out of Rush’s <i>Hemispheres</i>, ""Charging the Void"" showcases a revitalized band bursting with energy and creativity. ""A sky that once brought hope and light,"" sings DiSanto, ""now brings me desolation,"" as his screech reaches throat-shredding levels to convey his desperation. As the song progresses, the band is intent on matching the intensity of the lyrics: setting the stage for what’s to come like an overture before an opera. While the following tracks are not all quite as virtuosic and dazzling as that opener, there are hardly any dull moments.  </p>
<p>With its seventy-plus minute runtime, <i>Terminal Redux </i>occasionally threatens to become Vektor’s <i>Tales from Topographic Oceans</i> – a moment where their pretensions reach a head and alienate all but the already initiated. Their intensity, however, makes even the headier moments feel like breakthroughs. Tracks like ""Ultimate Artificer"" and ""LCD (Liquid Crystal Disease)"" should appease fans of the band’s more straightforward thrash material, while much of the album’s second half seems aimed at breaking the band to a larger, non-metal audience. Indeed, with this release marking the band’s upgrade to Earache Records, there are a few moments that hint at modern rock radio and festival audiences, calling to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"">Baroness</a>’ similarly expansive <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16771-yellow-green/"">Yellow &amp; Green</a></i>. In the album’s most divisive moments, DiSanto sings in a surprisingly pretty, shoegaze whisper. The crawling intro to ""Collapse,"" for example, would not sound out of place on either of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"">Red House Painter</a>’s self-titled albums (that is, of course, until it launches into its galloping, duel-guitar-soaked second half).</p>
<p>And then there’s ""Recharging the Void,"" a song that mimics the album opener both in title and ambition. In thirteen-and-a-half minutes, it is burdened with the task of closing the album and tying the loose ends of the story (incidentally, it also seems to be where 75% of the narrative takes place). In an almost ambient middle section, DiSanto sings as melodically and sweetly as he can, while psychedelic falsetto vocals swiped from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5191-pentangle/"">Pentangle</a> record float in the background like bits of meteoric dust hurtling through the cosmos. ""All we ask is our story to be told,"" DiSanto sings, ""To young, beckoning, yearning worlds."" You can practically see the intergalactic cast of characters returning to the stage, swaying back and forth in solidarity.</p>
<p>Like most prog albums – and, hell, a good deal of metal – it’s a lot to handle all at once, and maybe a bit silly, but Vektor plays it with the straight-faced intensity of a big-budget sci-fi movie. In that sense, the album calls to mind a few wider-scope metal breakthroughs from the genre’s golden era – the raising-the-stakes intensity of Death’s <i>Human </i>or the laser-beam focus of Kreator’s <i>Pleasure to Kill</i>. In fact, if there’s anything Vektor has prominently coopted from '80s metal, it’s that specific fearlessness: a devotion to their craft and an insistence on evolving clearly from album to album. <i>Terminal Redux </i>presents their most fully-formed evolution yet and offers more proof that they are beholden to no one’s artistic path but their own. In fact, more bands should be following their lead.</p></div>"|21645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21645-vektor-terminal-redux/|8.2|Sam Sodomsky

Still, if you attempted to take stock of <i>everything</i> that could be fairly placed under that tent, you might start with experimental music, move through dance music’s various permutations and end up at the sort of post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"">Postal Service</a> pop you’d expect to hear in a car commercial. <i>Trágame Tierra</i>, the latest full-length from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2987-mellowdrone/"">Mellowdrone</a> frontman and touring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a> member Jonathan Bates, feels like just such a survey of all things ""electronic."" This is a record that pivots from industrial noise to radio-friendly pop on a dime, which counts Debbie Gibson among its guests yet closes with 10 minutes of synth drone. To call <i>Trágame Tierra</i> ambitious would be an understatement.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Bates’ adventurousness and disregard for genre lines results in some novel combinations. ""Well My Heart"" layers a folk-country vocal over racing synth arpeggios and an '80s pop rhythm. ""Overlord"" starts out as a pounding house number yet lands somewhere closer to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">Knife</a>’s deviant Scandinavian electro-pop. ""Kid Icarus"" is powered by an appropriately chiptune-like beat but counts a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Brian Wilson</a> falsetto among its vocal quirks. And the aforementioned Gibson feature carries ""RCVR"" to a place where The Cars, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5612-vangelis/"">Vangelis</a> meet.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, Bates’ stock in trade here is middle-of-the-road electronic-pop, the sort of music you might find yourself fidgeting to while standing in line at the pharmacy. There’s an arena-sized ambition in these songs—widescreen production, huge choruses, layer after layer of instrumentation and vocals—but Bates’ ability as a songwriter to deliver on that intent is limited. As eager to please as these songs are, none of them can really be called catchy or memorable; big hooks abound but none of them stick.</p>
<p>Lyrically too, <i>Trágame Tierra</i> offers far too little to hold on to. On nearly every song, it feels like Bates is aiming for maximum reliability but often ends up with phrasings that feel wholly generic: ""Gonna grow old in California,"" ""You can bring me up/Just to bring me down,"" ""Well my heart, she is a-melting."" One song finds Bates reassuring the listener by repeating the phrase, ""It’s OK"" ad nauseam. These sorts of lyrics only reinforce the feeling that many of these tracks are more jingle than song.</p>
<p>To be certain, Bates does have plenty of potential as a musician. For evidence of this, just look to some of the minor details tucked away in these songs: the wobbly, mournful synths that open up ""I See Fit,"" the delicate, chiming melodies of ""H.A."" and ""Strange Cakes,"" the joyously bent notes that scurry through ""RCVR""’s coda. However, there are just too many ideas crammed into these songs and far too few that connect. On <i>Trágame Tierra</i>, Bates is both audacious and original, two qualities that are hard to fault. But in the absence of focus, listening to <i>Trágame Tierra</i> can feel like looking for dinner in a candy store: there's a lot of brightly-colored packaging to take in but not much you can really sink your teeth into.</p></div>"|21857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21857-tragame-tierra/|4.7|Mehan Jayasuriya

This spring at New York's Whitney Museum, the artist <a href=""http://www.praxisfilms.org/about/laura-poitras"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laura Poitras</a>—best known for her 2014 film about the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, <i><a href=""https://citizenfourfilm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Citizenfour</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">—offered a harrowing answer. Within her multimedia exhibition </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Astro Noise</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> was a piece called </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bed Down Location</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. It invited viewers to lay on a platform in the dark, assuming what in yoga is referred to as ""corpse pose."" The installation</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> lulled you with doomy static and dispassionate male voices. The night skies of Somalia, Pakistan, and Yemen were projected at the ceiling like a planetarium. The idea was to stare at them—the celestial expanses of countries in which the U.S. has launched drone warfare—and think. To imagine human lives reduced to coordinates on a grid, as if flesh and blood were part of an exercise in a math textbook. To imagine balls of fire falling onto us. To imagine death. A New Yorker might be struck by just how many stars those skies contained. Struck by how they look like sheets of glitter. By the beauty of an ornamented mustard-yellow building under our big Moon. By how nature could look like an oil painting. By how you want to be there. The emotion of Poitras' work did not just show the cost of our sense of protection—irrevocably, the cost was felt.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I thought of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33370-anohni/"">Anohni</a>'s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">there. Both Anohni and Poitras have constructed monumental works this year dealing in the atrocity of post-9/11 America—drone warfare, mass surveillance, violent masculinity. These are the depths into which </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> demands that you swim or drown. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a record where the American dream is a hallucination, where Big Brother lustfully becomes ""daddy/ohhh,"" where we are all called out. It is the sonic equivalent of a burning </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shepard Fairey painting</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and all its embers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As leader of the chamber pop ensemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"">Antony and the Johnsons</a> for two decades, the musician formerly known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty/"">Antony Hegarty</a> has always been in dialogue with the present.  But now, with co-producers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, there are many more layers of rigor to that conversation. Anohni has undergone a musical metamorphosis, crafting another outlet for her vision: the electronic dance anthem as visceral protest song. So much has unfolded in the six years since Anohni's last studio album with the Johnsons—Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, the trial of Chelsea Manning, the Black Lives Matter movement. Anohni—ecofeminist soul warrior, dramatist, a person who Lou Reed called an ""angel""—it would be hard to find a more capable figure to lead us into a </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">woke pop polemic.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poignant political realities have always grounded Anohni's work, but now they are at the forefront, articulated with an incisiveness that stares you in the eye. You have never heard words like ""chemotherapy,"" ""child molesters,"" and ""mass graves"" crooned so gorgeously. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> places Anohni alongside radical pop provocateurs like M.I.A., artists who propose difficult questions that mainstream America does not want to ask because it<b> </b>would not know what to do with the answers. But Anohni insists that we raise our stakes. ""A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,"" <a href=""thequietus.com/articles/09478-antony-hegarty-meltdown-interview"">she said</a> in 2012. ""It's just so fucking boring and not useful. It's such a waste of our time... another reflection of how astray we are as a civilization.""</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">disrupts that. Anohni, HudMo, and OPN meet on an astral plane and construct a sleek salon there, where we can reflect on the current moment and perhaps be spurred to action. The elegant bombast of these tracks propels the issues forward with a clarity that is exacting and exhilarating. Anohni has worked with both of these electro sophisticates before (in June of 2011 OPN <a href=""https://twitter.com/0PN/status/85845444000886784"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>: ""antony doesn't use the internet anymore"") but </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> represents a new level of collaboration. The subject matter is daunting, but this is some of the most accessible and pristinely infectious music that any of these people have made. With that, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> simultaneously broadens Anohni's appeal and brings that appeal into focus.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Drone Bomb Me"" is sung from the perspective of a seven-year-old girl whose family falls victim to a targeted killing. ""Blow my head off/Explode my crystal guts,"" Anohni sings, describing toxic reality with a honeyed cadence, and as this body-music gets under your skin, its subject—which in life is too often abstracted—makes an appeal to the heart. In her singing I am reminded of what we mean by ""soul"" music: empathy, pain, sincerity, dignity, the truth of life. I am also reminded that Anohni <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/36223-watch-antony-and-the-johnsons-crazy-in-love-video/"">covered Beyoncé</a> years ago, that her voice crushes you like Adele's. This isn't the first time Anohni has overlapped with dance music—she <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47419-watch-antony-hegarty-perform-blind-with-hercules-and-love-affair-for-the-first-time/"">collaborated with Hercules and Love Affair</a>, and in 2013, the DJ Avicii included an electro house remix of ""Hope There's Someone"" on his album </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">True</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. (Perhaps Anohni heard its hyper-masculine drops and thought: </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ummmm…</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">..)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Production-wise, the </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> team did not take the obvious route, which would have been doomy post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a> metal scraps from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"">Yeezus</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">' industrial wasteland. If </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> recalls any Arca song, it's the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19836-arca-xen/"">xen</a> philosophy of 2014's unsettlingly beatific ""Sisters."" (That Mohawke, a producer on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yeezus</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21542-the-life-of-pablo/"">Pablo</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17354-kanye-west-all-day-ft-allan-kingdom-theophilus-london-and-paul-mccartney/"">""All Day,""</a> should serve as a connective between Anohni and Kanye—who've both worked to infiltrate and subvert—makes a lot of sense.) The sinister rumble of ""Violent Men"" and the ominous ""Obama"" monologue makes them outliers here, texturing </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> with darker, episodic pieces. The maximalist slam-dunk beats of HudMo's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"">TNGHT</a> project are absent, but the burnt-rubber bounce that opens ""Obama"" hints at it. There's an impulse to place ""Obama"" in the tradition of scathing presidential take-downs—like Stevie Wonder's ""You Haven't Done Nothin'"" or Neil Young's ""Let's Impeach the President""—but the way Anohni turns liberal subterfuge into a literal hex feels more complicated. ""Obama"" recounts how the world cried for joy when the President was elected and how furiously disappointing recent years have been, ""all the hope drained from your face."" These are menacing lyrics you would still more readily expect to be railed by a contemporary punk band like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32890-downtown-boys/"">Downtown Boys</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31119-priests/"">Priests</a> (""Barack Obama killed something in me,"" Katie Greer </span><a href=""https://priests.bandcamp.com/track/and-breeding"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">succinctly put it in 2014</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, ""And I'm gonna get him for it!"") than any pop star.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Violent Men""—an ambient, pitch-shifted meditation on the need to ""never again give birth to violent men""—underscores the essential theme of these songs, which is the violence of patriarchy as the core of all oppression. And this leads to another tenet of <i>HOPELESSNESS</i>: ecofeminism. On the 2012 Johnsons live album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16902-cut-the-world/"">Cut the World</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> there was a poetic speech called ""Future Feminism,"" which situated Anohni unmistakably into this context—the basic idea that feminism must extend its liberationist ethos from gender, race, class, and physical abilities into nature. Ecofeminism defines the stunning ""4 Degrees,"" alluding to the impending global temperature-increase that will factually topple our ecosystem. ""I want to see this world/I want to see it boil,"" Anohni sings, belting out a striking catalog of the dogs, lemurs, rhinos, and other creatures who are going to perish because of our selfishness and greed. The mood is heavy, urgent, dire—a fully-issued wake-up call bearing reportorial weight, an ultralight beam parting a cloud. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Anohni's vast environmental songs are like modern rewrites of Kate Bush's ""The Big Sky,"" where the once-innocent vaults of heaven are more foreboding, sites of hidden remote-control murder, invisible all-watching eyes, gas emissions. And yet underlying these songs is a plea for a kind of love that implicates all life. As Anohni sings of our current apocalypse, her voice and these beats have some semblance of utopia in them. It is music about death and destruction that sounds deep-down infatuated by the forces that keep us alive.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The bracing ""Why Did You Separate Me From the Earth?"" is another ecofeminist epic, the no-future punk tradition born anew: ""I don't want your future/I'll never return/I'll be born into the past."" </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> makes the lethal clashes of capitalism and nature, of the industrial and the organic, impossible to ignore. Crucially, ecofeminism posits that a masculine sense-of-self considers itself separate of the world, whereas a feminine sense-of-self sees itself as fundamentally interconnected, with responsibilities. All violence and ecological crises, then, come from failing to make connections. Anohni poses a most pressing question of late-capitalism: ""Why did you separate me from the Earth?""</span></p>
<p>""Watch Me,"" meanwhile, is <b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">possibly the most sensual piece of musical <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_art"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">surveillance art</a> ever</span></b>. Crisp, cavernous beats boom over ambient noise, and our nightmarish culture of intercepted metadata floats into eerie seduction—there's a degree of absurdity to that, befitting the absurdity of our world. In ""Watch Me"" Anohni is being spied on in her hotel room: ""Watch me watching pornography/Watch me talking to my friends and my family,"" she sings, gliding gracefully, ""I know you love me/‘Cause you're always watching me/Protecting me from evil/Protecting me from terrorism/Protecting me from child molesters."" With bone-chilling intimacy, Anohni reveals so much about how surveillance culture cuts out the potential of choice. ""Watch Me"" is the <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> song that is most likely to lodge itself into your skull with its euphoric melody, but plot-twist: you can't </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">really</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sing it in public. Astonishingly, then, ""Watch Me"" is song about surveillance that might make you surveil yourself—an act of sousveillance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One is reminded of Anohni's connection to former Johnsons member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"">William Basinski</a>. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> should fall alongside his ambient classic <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17064-the-disintegration-loops/"">The Disintegration Loops</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in the canon of music that responds to post-9/11 America. The songs constantly underscore Anohni's complicity—from a pained utterance that ""I'm partly to blame"" to how she cries through the ecstatic apology of ""Crisis""—but </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> also comes with an embodied promise of change. The message is encoded into every note: If Anohni's music can manifest into something new, then perhaps we can. There is risk involved with moving from a timeless sound towards one that attempts to capture a moment, but without risk art is worthless. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Earlier this year, news broke that Anohni would not appear at the Oscars. She was the first transgender performer to ever be nominated—on the successes of a song she wrote about ecocide for a movie literally called </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Racing Extinction</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">—but the honor was diminished when she was not invited to perform at the ceremony. In response, Anohni <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63773-anohni-why-i-am-not-attending-the-academy-awards/"">wrote an essay</a> about the decision that is itself a remarkable document. ""They are going to try to convince us that they have our best interests at heart by waving flags for identity politics and fake moral issues,"" she wrote. ""But don't forget that many of these celebrities are the trophies of billionaire corporations whose only intention is to manipulate you into giving them your consent and the last of your money. They have been paid to do a little tap dance to occupy you while Rome burns.""</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is not afraid to sway within the flames, to draw you towards the heat. The fact is that Anohni's dramas cannot exist in a world of Hollywood endings. They are too real for a silver lining. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> communicates the horror of seeing that in so many ways we have been profoundly fooled by the fantasy of the American experiment. By how the stars are not just stars. By how they contain lies. By how the truest protagonist of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HOPELESSNESS</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is us.</span></p></div>"|21819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21819-hopelessness/|9.0|Jenn Pelly

While the movement’s largely male figureheads were more than happy to detail the emotional harm they suffered in relationships—usually at the hands of women—their avoidance of the topic of sex was near puritanical. Arriving nearly twenty years after the fact, Ann Arbor’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31637-pity-sex/"">Pity Sex</a> felt like something of a corrective. Despite their typical beginnings—hardcore scene vets start melodic project—Pity Sex were very much unlike their peers, a co-ed emo act willing to venture beyond the bedroom door. What’s more, their first-person vignettes turned emo’s central trope on its head, telling stories of doomed romances from the perspective of the unfeeling aggressor, rather than the wounded victim. “There’s nothing to talk about,” one such protagonist admits on 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18502-pity-sex-feast-of-love/"">Feast of Love</a></i>, “When we talk about love.""</p>
<p>Pity Sex don’t sound all that emo these days; since their noisy, shambolic beginnings on 2012’s <i>Dark World</i>, they’ve expanded their sonic palette, borrowing guitar tones from alternative rock’s '90s heyday and brisk, hooky songwriting from that same era's pop-punk. Their latest, <i>White Hot Moon</i>, doesn’t stray far from this path, though it does find the band further cleaning up their sound, with the assistance of producer Will Yip. There’s a satisfying crispness to be found on <i>White Hot Moon</i>, from the crunch of its power chords to the bright pop of each snare hit. Like many of Yip’s projects, <i>White Hot Moon</i> recalls a time when even scruffy bands like Jawbreaker had access to the sort of studio equipment a major label budget affords.</p>
<p>Still, if you’ve been following Pity Sex, most of <i>White Hot Moon</i>’s dynamics will feel familiar: quiet verses, loud choruses, fuzzed-out guitars set atop driving percussion. The beating heart of most Pity Sex songs lies in the interplay between Brennan Greaves' stoic tone and Britty Drake’s earnest delivery, and lead single “Burden You” leverages this formula to great effect. Here, Greaves takes on some of the messier lines (""Follow me home between my sheets and mend the burden in me”) with a cool detachment, while Drake alternates between singing “I wanna burden you” and “I wanna burn in you,” channeling the dark intimacy of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18517-nirvana-in-utero-20th-anniversary-edition/"">In Utero</a></i>-era Kurt Cobain. That’s not all they’re borrowing from the monsters of alt-rock: the song closes with a squall of feedback that creeps up steadily through the final verses. Even so, the kicker—Drake’s gutting admission, “I’ll always think of your lips/When I’m moving mine against his”—feels like a signature Pity Sex move, an emotional time-bomb delivered as a casual aside.</p>
<p>Most of <i>White Hot Moon</i> plays out similarly, from the punky sprint of “Orange and Red” to the squealing string bends and knuckle-dragging minor chords of “White Hot Moon.” For evidence of the band venturing outside of their comfort zone, look to the handful of ballads, which extend their range with mixed results. “Dandelion” gets by on prettiness, hiding its payload inside of the kind of bodily metaphors (""Let roots run through me like veins, ventricles, and arteries”) that rank among emo’s most beloved clichés. “September” goes further yet—here, the band attempts to pass as a clean-cut, Midwestern emo act. Its sappiness is maybe a bit too on the nose: after all, the refrain of “You are the earth beneath my feet” is just a few words away from being a Bette Midler lyric.</p>
<p>The album’s most striking number, “Plum,” manages to put that same earnestness to better use, with Drake detailing the loss of a parent with an artful yet unflinching candor. Her sadness here is deeply felt but never morose, while the band provides just enough muscle to propel the narrative forward. Pity Sex’s primary asset is their willingness to approach emotionally difficult topics head-on, and “Plum” is perhaps the most wrenching demonstration of this skill yet.</p>
<p>Overall, <i>White Hot Moon</i> is likely to please existing fans of Pity Sex—its 12 tracks largely find the band continuing to leverage what worked on <i>Feast of Love</i>. That said, <i>White Hot Moon</i> isn’t quite as catchy as that record—its hooks feel a bit dilute next to an earworm like “Drown Me Out.” The band's relative lack of growth here is also disappointing. Certainly, their central conceit—using the tools of angsty, suburban teens to get at some very adult themes—continues to be compelling. But with an emo revival in full swing, they’re hardly alone in this endeavor. Just look to bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31608-the-world-is-a-beautiful-place-i-am-no-longer-afra/"">The World is a Beautiful Place...</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31939-the-hotelier/"">The Hotelier</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31567-touche-amore/"">Touché Amoré</a>, all of whom have found emo to be a more than capable vehicle for mature songwriting. Emo is growing up, but is Pity Sex?</p></div>"|21794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21794-white-hot-moon/|6.5|Mehan Jayasuriya

This edition of the 1982 <i>….Wins the World Cup</i> tells an interesting story and exemplifies a particular moment in Jamaican music history—all the while providing a bit of an object lesson in dub reggae. </p>
<p>The cheekily titled album’s release coincided with the 1982 FIFA World Cup—complete with Tony McDermott’s tell-tale album art depicting a reggae-fied team beating England 6-to-1. Originally titled <i>Scientist Wins the World Cup</i>, the record features the legendary Roots Radics and the studio stylings of Overton H. ""Scientist"" Brown, with producer Henry ""Junjo"" Lawes acting as ""referee."" The tracks are labelled ""Dangerous Match,"" numbers 1–10, followed by five separate tracks entitled ""Extra Time"" and the final track aptly named ""Golden Goal."" Initially reissued in 2002, the new version seriously ups the ante by providing the whole World Cup-winning game, and then the original versions of the songs. There are also some extra counteraction deejay tunes—vocal versions that provide an alternative perspective. This move places the emphasis on Junjo—and the title therefore shifts to <i>Junjo Presents: Wins the World Cup</i>. Doesn’t have the ring of the original, but it points to the role played by the producer in advance of the dub treatment.</p>
<p>Dub reggae is its own particular thing. A bass-driven, heavy version of reggae, dub breaks down songs into component parts and then sticks them all back together after playing around with all the pieces. Scientist was one of the masters of the form. Born in 1960, he was a teenager as reggae edged into the era of extreme studio experimentation, exemplified by the creative genius of producers such as Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and Osbourne ""King Tubby"" Ruddock. It was Tubby who apparently dubbed him ""Scientist"" after hearing the young Brown talking about his ideas for adjusting and altering studio technology (http://www.niceup.com/interviews/scientist). In the case of <i>…Wins the World Cup</i>, Junjo produced and arranged a series of songs with the Roots Radics and a range of vocalists. These recordings were taken from Channel One on Maxfield Avenue to King Tubby’s Waterhouse Studio in another part of town to be experimented with by Scientist.  </p>
<p>The record demonstrates that the general sense some folks have about a shift between the roots- and-culture focus of the 1970s and the degenerative digital dancehall 1980s isn’t really the case. The production prowess of Junjo paired with Scientist’s touch created classic late-70s reggae songs like ""Collie Weed"" by Barrington Levy and Sugar Minnott’s ""Oh Mr D.C."", but also slack dancehall king Yellowman’s tunes in the early 80s. <i>…Wins the World Cup</i> is the sweet spot right in the middle.</p>
<p>As for the tunes, this collection provides an insight into the dub process by allowing easy side-by-side comparison between vocal originals and dub versions. Listening to Johnny Osbourne’s well-known ""Ice Cream Love"" followed by ""Extra Time One"" draws attention to Scientist’s dropping of the vocal after the first line, echoing in the distance until it is but a trace in the background, just audible under the bass and the added wobble on the guitar. At moments, even the bass drops out, leaving the spare, metallic rhythm, and the reverberation of the drum and that bit of tinny melody. It’s much easier to hear how this provides a near opposite to the ""warmer than chocolate fudge"" original when you can switch back and forth. Little sounds stick out—it’s difficult to not play the game of what’s missing and what’s been added.</p>
<p>The wobbly bits on ""Dangerous Match Three"" the dub version of Hugh Mandell’s ""Jacqueline"" sound like they might be the reason for dubstep being called dubstep. The echo of the drums rings out each measure, being pushed along by the bass, accompanied by the clear jangle of guitar and sparkle of horns. Wayne Jarrett’s vocal on ""Ranny and Lou,"" a song about two of Jamaica’s most well-loved performers, is virtually eliminated in ""Dangerous Match Ten,"" drawing attention to piano and organ. The dub treatment tends to play with listener focus, pulling attention from one instrument to the next, seemingly adding extra creaks and beeps just to confound the listener. Regardless, the weight and depth of these tunes lend them to being played loud and for a long time.</p></div>"|21810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21810-junjo-presents-wins-the-world-cup/|7.7|Erin MacLeod

One: a solid Philadelphia band making fuzzy, mid-fi indie rock. The other was as an offshoot of <a href=""http://everyoneeverywheremusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Everyone Everywhere</a>, who <a href=""http://everyoneeverywhere.bandcamp.com/album/everyone-everywhere"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">released</a> <a href=""http://everyoneeverywhere.bandcamp.com/album/everyone-everywhere-2012"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two</a> of the first truly outstanding albums from emo's fourth wave, albeit ones that predated 2013’s mini-explosion of ""revival"" trendwatching by at least a year. Taken in combination, those two views could work against Scottoline: there are damn near hundreds of solid bands in Philadelphia making fuzzy, mid-fi indie rock and only one Everyone Everywhere, whose near total inactivity since <i></i>2012 feels like more of a semi-permanent hiatus than a result of their methodical work ethic. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hurry's third LP <i>Guided Meditation </i>sounds like a credibility bid for Scottoline's fledgling new band. The cover might be <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCkmIwRrc0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Brian Eno homage</a>, but there is no magical <a href=""http://www.clashmusic.com/news/coldplay-confirm-new-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Enoxification</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""http://www.clashmusic.com/news/coldplay-confirm-new-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""</a> happening here. Their success is in their ability to be serious about frivolity, which could be an oblique strategy all its own. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The difference is entirely present within a rerecorded version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17288-hurry-shake-it-off/"">“Shake It Off,""</a> which appeared on a stacked 2015 <a href=""https://lame-orecords.bandcamp.com/album/strength-in-weakness"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">six-way charity split</a> that damn nears as a mini-</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Singles </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">soundtrack for Philadelphia. Perhaps they figured since it would be associated with Taylor Swift anyways,</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Shake It Off"" removes anything that made the original sound bashful—the unnecessary feedback is sheared, the performance is significantly tightened, Scottoline’s vocals aren’t subject to the same fuzz as the guitars. And there you go: Hurry decided they’re really a power-pop band at heart, not indie rock.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regardless of how much Scottoline’s beloved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided By Voices</a> influenced the writing of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Guided Meditation, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">this is more in the lineage of the Posies and Matthew Sweet, acts who would’ve been considered pure </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">pop </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">had they existed in a different decade or just simply sold more records. And like them, Scottoline writes from a position of weakness, of being </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/hurryband/status/718106612918001664"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“dumb and in love""</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and not always both at the same time: he’s incapable of handling life due to the prospect of a new crush on “Fascination"" (“overthink and overplan imagining you hold my hand""), uses relationships as a shield from life’s responsibilities (“Under Her Thumb""), retreats the moment those responsibilities start piling up (“Nothing to Say"") and ends </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Guided Meditation</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> wishing for a kind of zen existence that requires nothing out of him (“I Wanna Be You"").</span></p>
<p>They’re adolescent feelings that don’t really ever go away and Scottoline honors them by letting them speak for themselves. Likewise, Hurry doesn’t overcomplicate things musically—they abide by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a> Method that states all vocal melodies should sound good as guitar leads and that instant gratification can be replicable gratification. Hurry are capable of expanse and modest grandeur, though like Everyone Everywhere, they find a kind of psychedelia in everyday fatigue—“Love is Elusive"" cruises through six-and-a-half minutes of flanger clouds towards a sunburst of layered harmonies and “Nothing to Say"" feels like companion piece to Everyone Everywhere’s definitive <a href=""http://everyoneeverywhere.bandcamp.com/track/i-feel-exhausted"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I Feel Exhausted""</a> if cubicle-bound anxiety was traded for a three-beer daze at happy hour.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But music this reliant on simple pleasures is also inherently risky. If the melodies don’t connect, there isn’t much to fall back on and occasionally </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Guided Meditation </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">harkens back to Hurry’s less distinct previous work. Still, the lack of punk or emo or played-out '90s touchstones (i.e., <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a>) in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Guided Meditation</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> makes it at least something close to novel in 2016. Fittingly, the most easygoing and instantly ingratiating song here (""When I'm With You"") shares <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN1XzxOQWrA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a title</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"">Best Coast</a>. As with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14472-crazy-for-you/"">Crazy for You</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Guided Meditation </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">can be accused of being too simplistic, too sweet and unengaged with the present. But, really: isn't being dumb and in love the most uncomplicated state of being?  So when Scottoline sings, “I don’t even have to try when I’m with you/All the stupid things I say, you know they’re true,"" it damn sure sounds like the truth.</span></p></div>"|21815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21815-guided-meditation/|7.1|Ian Cohen

If this is true, then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29-aesop-rock/"">Aesop Rock</a>’s grid must look like the cascading sea of glyphs from </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The</span></i> <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matrix. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He has a wickedly extensive vocabulary, once deemed by a <a href=""http://poly-graph.co/vocabulary.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">study</a> to be the largest in rap, and he uses it to warp time and disrupt balance with phonetic pairings that sprout out unpredictably, an idea best articulated on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/512-busdriver/"">Busdriver</a> collaboration ""Ego Death"": ""I am ivy up the goddamn lattice/March to the math rock."" </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On ""Rings,"" the single from his latest album </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Impossible Kid </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">his second on indie rap mainstay Rhymesayers Entertainment, he eulogizes the visual art career he abandoned. ""I left some years, a deer in the light/I left some will to spirit away/I let my fears materialize/I let my skills deteriorate,"" he raps, splitting all of the syllables on the back end.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> But he still is a visual artist in his way, coiling carefully articulated sentences into diagrams, each syllable a pixel in the frame of an image. He sketches in vibrant detail on<i> Impossible Kid, </i>balancing heavy verbiage with sharp clarity.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> This is what it sounds like when rap’s greatest wordsmith only uses the ones that count.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's also the most specific Aesop Rock has ever been about what he’s thinking or feeling, and it borders at times on confessional. ""Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage/Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?/I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain/I’m trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste,"" he asks on ""Dorks."" That doesn’t mean he’s making it easy; his yarns are still sometimes purposefully written like a puzzle with half the pieces missing. But the album </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">loosely outlines the series of events and strained relationships that led him to abandon San Francisco for the seclusion of a cabin in the woods.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""Get Out of the Car"" is a poignant reflection on loss and grief that points to the death of close friend and rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10349-camu-tao/"">Camu Tao</a> as the starting point for much of his anguish. ""Ah watch the impossible kid, everything that he touch turns promptly to shit/If I zoom on out I can finally admit, it’s all been a blur since ‘Mu got sick,"" he raps before diving down a rabbit hole of depression, explaining his withdrawal in expertly articulated tidbits and snapshots (""Into the woods go his alien tongue/It was that or a textbook faking of funk, and I can’t""). Then there’s ""Blood Sandwich,"" which casts his brothers in starring roles in two memorable vignettes: In the first, his younger brother plays in a Little League game interrupted by a wayward gopher, a rodent that suffers a bloody end at the hands of the enraged coach. The second is a remembrance of his older brother's teen angst at being denied the opportunity to go to a Ministry show, resulting in a suicide threat. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Later on, he studies the actions of his cat on ""Kirby"" before psychoanalyzing their relationship and society’s larger relationship with the felines as a whole, which have been everything from gods to memes. Each one of these songs constructs little worlds out of simple ideas using dexterous lyricism.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Impossible Kid</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is measured by more than its virtuosity. The soundbeds of dizzying synth abstractions, ominous piano crawls, and slow-strutting garage rock samples, all provided by Aesop Rock himself, are monuments to his growing skills as a producer. He is as detail-oriented with his beats as he is with his raps, providing the right mood at every occasion. Some of them are busy and swarming, while others are pleasantly simple, like ""Lotta Years,"" giving Aesop the room to set up dialogue. Then there are beats that are simply hard-hitting, like ""Rabies"" and ""Water Tower,"" with slapping drums that seem traditional until they stagger. These all supplement his writing, which is as crisp and as fluid as it has ever been, bending breakbeats to the whims of his strung-out cadences. Aesop Rock has yet to run out of words. After nearly 20-years in the rap game, he is still finding new means of self-expression.</span></p></div>"|21687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21687-the-impossible-kid/|8.2|Sheldon Pearce

His handle is egyptianlover661, where 661 is a reference to DMSR-661, the catalog number for the first record a young Greg Broussard ever put out on his own Egyptian Empire label back in 1984. ""DMSR"" was a reference to his idol <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21842-1999/"">1999</a></i> ""D.M.S.R."" (Dance Music Sex Romance). The record was called ""Egypt, Egypt,"" and it became a hit and a West Coast hip hop/electro staple. In making it, Egyptian Lover drew on both Prince (May He Rest in Peace and Reign in Purple) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>. He combined the melody from Kraftwerk's ""Trans Europe Express"" that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/581-afrika-bambaataa/"">Afrika Bambaataa</a> had sampled on ""Planet Rock,"" flipping it and inserting it into his own electrofunk framework, with the addition of some heavy breathing à la The Purple One.</p>
<p>""Egypt, Egypt"" along with 21 other tracks have now been compiled, smartly sequenced, and packaged into <i>1983-1988</i>, a 4-LP Stones Throw anthology that charts the Lover’s reign over West Coast hip hop during that same time. The anthology itself contains the majority of Egyptian Lover’s <i>On the Nile</i> album (including ""Egypt, Egypt"") with a couple of fresh re-edits from Stones Throw’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6136-peanut-butter-wolf/"">Peanut Butter Wolf </a>(""Yes, Yes, Yes"" and ""My Beat Goes Boom""), 12"" singles, never-released material, and others—all taken from the original master tapes. The anthology is mostly chronological, and the accompanying booklet contains a track-by-track breakdown as recounted by the Lover himself. (Full disclosure: Pitchfork contributor Jeff Weiss wrote the liner notes.) There aren’t any big sonic shifts or tracks that speak to particular ""phases"" the Egyptian Lover went through, mainly because for the years between '83-'88 and for the entire 30 years he’s been in the game, he’s primarily only had one phase and overarching sound: old-school electrofunk—that '80s 808-driven, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3256-parliament/"">Parliament</a>- and Kraftwerk-inspired, breakbeats-referencing, futuristic-yet-analog pastiche that laid the foundation for everything from g-funk to techno to Miami bass that followed.</p>
<p>Egyptian Lover has remained similarly faithful over the years to his persona as a freak-a-holic pharaoh blasted forth from that bend in the space-time continuum known as his mind. His origin myth begins in high school, by which time he was already making and selling his own pause-button mixtapes to other students under his Egyptian Lover moniker. Broussard says he got his name in part from Rudolph Valentino, the famous white actor who played an ""Arab sheik"" in <i>The Sheik,</i> during that vibrant era of racist 1920s black and white films. The young Greg Broussard was drawn to Valentino’s <i>savoir faire</i>. Additionally, growing up in South Central Los Angeles in the '70s and '80s, he was drawn to King Tut, who represented to him a kind of mystique, power, and escape. Hence ""Egyptian Lover"" was born. </p>
<p>Not long after graduating high school, the young Lover was invited to join the ranks of Uncle Jamm’s Army, the top LA dance party crew at the time. KDAY Radio bumped them constantly, and at their peak, they filled up 10,000-capacity sports arenas. The Egyptian Lover became Uncle Jamm’s star DJ, spinning, scratching, and wreaking freaky havoc on dancefloors across LA, alongside Unknown DJ, Cli-N-Tel, Chris ""The Glove"" Taylor, and Ice-T, among others. The latter two, along with Egyptian Lover, can be seen working their magic at the infamous Radio Club (later Radiotron) in the landmark West Coast hip hop documentary <i>Breakin’ N’ Enterin’</i>. Not accidentally, Lover had also been hired to score the film, and two of those tracks are featured on the anthology: ""Egyptian Lover Theme"" and ""Spray It Super AJ.""</p>
<p>These LA mobile dance party crews, including World Class Wreckin’ Cru and LA Dream Team, were where a number of prominent West Coast DJs, producers, and MCs got their start. World Class Wreckin’ Cru, which included a young Dr. Dre, along with fellow future NWA member Yella, followed swiftly in Uncle Jamm’s steps in producing electro hits like ""Surgery"" and ""Juice""—but only after Uncle Jamm’s had already changed the game a year earlier by being the first LA crew to press to vinyl, producing hits like ""Dial-A-Freak"" and ""Yes, Yes, Yes,"" which now find their place on <i>1983-1988</i>. </p>
<p>Since then, Egyptian Lover’s sound hasn’t changed a whole lot, but in the 30-some years he’s been in the game, he’s been able to manipulate a lot of different sounds out of the machines he uses. Often, this has meant his beloved 808 in various combinations with turntables, a mic, vocoder, and SH-101 bass synth (among <a href=""http://www.thafoundation.com/egypt.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">others</a>). Clocking in at just under 2 minutes, ""What is a DJ if He Can’t Scratch"" is a quick flex on all the DJs who can’t scratch, MCs who can’t rap, and beats made without live claps. A more minimalistic and rhythm-focused cut from his debut album <i>On the Nile</i>, the track shows off EL’s scratching techniques, including his ability to play a record backwards entirely on-beat. By contrast, ""I Cry (Night After Night)"" from the same album, is the most melodic and Prince-ly pop song of the lot and even incorporates electric guitar. Egyptian Lover whimpers, recounting his nightly walks staring up at the stars, looking himself in the mirror, and bemoaning an unrequited love interest. Over '80s drum smacks, he programs high, breathy, Prince-inspired call-and-response vocals and twinkly bells that ornament his raps, which are equal parts horny and humorous.</p>
<p>Lover also wasn’t afraid to stretch hip-hop into more experimental territory. The track ""Electric Encounter,"" which was never actually completed until the making of this anthology, is basically a conceptual electronic number set to a hard funk beat. ""Gears (gears), belts (belts),"" recites a chipmunk voice, running through a long list of ""computer"" parts. ""Plugs (plugs), switches (switches), nuts (nuts), and bolts (and bolts)."" Over the course of the song, this computer’s desire for an electric encounter burns through its inner circuitry, and a heavily distorted hardware meltdown ensues, resulting in a gloopy puddle of busted wires and melted transistors.</p>
<p>This tendency to blur the lines between human and machine, reality and fantasy, and present and future is a hallmark of Egyptian Lover’s particular imagination—as well as of electro more broadly. ""Kinky Nation,"" originally released on <i>One Track Mind</i> (1986), lays out Lover’s vision of his kingdom come. It’s a sexual paradise guarded by a robot with a talk box for a voice, who greets visitors at the gates with a mechanized, ""Wel-come-to-the-kin-ky-na-tion."" Like many of Broussard’s songs, ""Kinky Nation"" also leans on old popular cultural depictions of Ancient Egypt–which have often relied on exotification, or even cartoonification, and which even today affect popular (mis)understandings of modern Egypt and Egyptians. On ""My House (On the Nile),"" as on ""Kinky Nation,"" EL describes his sex pad on the Nile, complete with camels out back and Egyptian women for whom ""there’s no substitute."" To be sure, Egyptian Lover injects a lot of humor into his music, but sometimes, as in the box set’s recent <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFnQ3LHG3VA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infomercial</a> or in his songs about bellydancers, the way the exoticism plays out can feel questionable or off-color.</p>
<p>That said, Egyptian Lover’s imagination is still colorful in other ways. On that same ""My House (On the Nile)"" record, he talks about getting freaky on his 50-foot waterbed flanked by solid gold speakers, from which blast the very song he’s singing. ""Dial-A-Freak,"" an early track from his Uncle Jamm’s days, is all about phone sex, an exercise in pornographic imagination if there ever was one. And on <i>1983-1988</i>’s final track, ""I Need A Freak,"" a remake of (unfortunately named) electro group Sexual Harassment’s single of the same name that Egyptian Lover then put on his 1994 <i>Back From The Tomb</i> album, and which now features additional synth work by Dam Funk, he raps, ""In these times of hate and pain, we need a remedy to take us from the rain…I need a freak!"" In the liner notes, Egyptian Lover mentions that when he first heard the song back in the day, he thought it sounded like Prince. So it seems only right that this is the note this anthology should end on.</p></div>"|21804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21804-egyptian-lover-1983-1988/|8.0|Minna Zhou

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Over the course of eight wildly divergent albums, the Melbourne psych-rock septet have fed the past 50 years of rock history through a paper shredder and seamlessly taped the strands back together in intriguing new patterns, even leaving in the parts (bluesy harmonica slobber, flute solos, jazz odysseys) that more cool-conscious retro-rock revivalists would excise. And through experimenting with myriad sounds, they’ve also started experimenting with album formats. Last year’s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Quarters!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> presented four prog-pop suites each clocking at exactly 10 minutes and 10 seconds. But </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nonagon Infinity</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ups the high-concept ante to absurd extremes. While pieced together from discretely recorded, separately titled songs, the record is mixed to feel like a continuous 41-minute live performance, complete with recurring musical and lyrical passages. And it’s the first album in history to give you a legitimate, practical reason to hit that Repeat button—</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nonagon Infinity </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is constructed as an infinite loop, meaning its final notes connect perfectly with the album’s opening.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But independent of that gambit, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nonagon Infinity </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is the Gizzard’s most ballistic, berserker album to date, a merciless, atomic-bomb erasure of the pastoral terrain traversed by its flower-powered predecessor, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Paper Mâché Dream Balloon</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. In their most hot-wired moments (see 2014’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20019-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-im-in-your-mind-fuzz/"">I’m in Your Mind Fuzz</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">), King Gizzard have earned copious comparisons to their former label patrons <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, and here frontman Stu Mackenzie punctuates almost every chord change with an echo-drenched, John Dwyer-esque “wooo” like a dancehall selector pushing the air-horn button. But on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nonagon Infinity,</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> they assume a more mechanistic precision and sinister, metallic force—all the better to reinforce the lyrics’ '70s sci-fi cartoon-show universe of robots, monsters, and hidden dimensions. Ironically, for an album that functions as a shrine to record-collector rock, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nonagon Infinity </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">operates on the same principles as a club DJ set, weaving in and out of different melodic motifs while remaining locked (for the most part) into a propulsive, breakneck rhythm that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"">Devo</a> riffing on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5395-hawkwind/"">Hawkwind</a>’s “Motorhead.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it’s running at peak velocity—which is like, 90 per cent of the time—</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nonagon Infinity </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">yields some of the most outrageous, exhilarating rock ‘n’ roll in recent memory, on par with modern psych-punk touchstones like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"">Comets on Fire</a>’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1563-blue-cathedral/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blue Cathedral</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Thee Oh Sees’ </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16013-carrion-crawlerthe-dream/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Carrion Crawler/The Dream</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/"">Slaughterhouse</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. It’s a preview of what our not-too-distant future of</span><a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/08/elon-musk-hyperloop-project-is-getting-kinda-serious/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">hyperloop travel</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> will feel like—this is a record that requires protective seat belts, induces G-force ripples in your cheeks and drives fingernails into armrest upholstery. But the band’s gonzo attack never overpowers Mackenzie’s psych-pop accessibility, as he spits out a stream of fragmented hooks like a combusting jukebox of British Invasion singles going on the fritz. If anything, his melodic change-ups provide crucial orientation markers on this endless Autobahn of a record. </span>The band also possess an innate sense of knowing just the right moment to switch things up, like with the loose Krautrock boogie that introduces “Mr. Beat,"" or the twinned Allman Brothers leads dropped into the “TV Eye”-style surge of ""Evil Death Roll,"" or the Yes-worthy contoro-riffs that overtake “Invisible Face”. (That said, the incense-scented Santana jam that breaks out partway through the latter piece constitutes the record’s only forced detour.)</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ultimately, the question of how the band will reconcile the chugging, roadhouse-razing closer “Road Train” with the album’s motorik opening proves moot—in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nonagon Infinity</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s final minute, the Gizzard effectively bring the former to a dead stop and then just quickly work themselves back up into the album’s familiar high-octane groove. At first, it feels like a bit of a cheat—a switcheroo the band could’ve conceivably dropped at any point in this piece, rather than a natural climax they’re working toward. But the instant </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nonagon Infinity</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> resets back to its blitzkrieged beginning, the gimmick’s greater purpose is revealed: this is the first album whose intro actually doubles as its crescendo. And </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nonagon Infinity </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is overstuffed with so many stomach-tossing thrills that you’ll actually be jonesing to ride the roller-coaster all over again. </span></p></div>"|21853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21853-nonagon-infinity/|8.0|Stuart Berman

While <i>Blue Wave </i>showcases enough synth-centric production to meet all of the requirements to recreate a genre once widely referred to as dream pop, the songs on this album<i> </i>teem with such agitation that it could be the photo negative of that style: nightmare pop.</p>
<p>Operators is the latest act from a man who has played vital roles in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5280-handsome-furs/"" target=""_blank"">Handsome Furs</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30530-divine-fits/"" target=""_blank"">Divine Fits</a>. With this project, Boeckner—along with bandmates Sam Brown and Devojka—has discovered the secret ingredient missing from so much of the music meant to reawaken the new wave sound of the 1980s: paranoia, at a peppy tempo. Between fear of Orwellian prophesies coming true in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52wis_sLT1I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1984</a> and the Cold <a href=""https://youtu.be/bEyKe8bRdWk?t=1m16s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">War machine springing to life</a>, there was plenty to be paranoid about in the 1980s, and the current political climate demands that more music be spiked with anxiety.</p>
<p>There's plenty of that to spare with <i>Blue Wave. </i>Throughout the album, Big Brother is watching as a pervasive ""they"": ""They come to correct you"" in ""Control""; ""They wanna see you moving underground"" in ""Cold Light""; and ""While we were sleeping, dreaming in our beds they moved the Earth"" in ""Evil.""  And like the best alarmist music of the Reagan era, this is all delivered with super danceable beats and synth sounds so fat and fizzy that they feel like the original analog instruments, rather than imitations by computer plug-ins. Boeckner's melodies are precise and the choruses show moments of bright clarity cutting through the foggy verses: not unlike fleeing a bleak reality to find asylum in a dream. He hasn't sounded this committed and angry since leading Atlas Strategic a decade and a half ago.</p>
<p>Boeckner captures a mood well, and his approach to the past is one of aggressive repurposing. Operators do à la carte shopping for 1983 tones and lyrical inspiration, boldly loading up at the buffet to get their money's worth. What could be a more fitting tribute to a decade of such excess? The <a href=""https://youtu.be/_u9GLyaWgXg?t=2m2s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> borrows the flangey echo guitar of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIpfWORQWhU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Ran</a>,"" the chugging rhythm of ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/Jt-R5hj_lWM?t=16s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Major Tom (Coming Home)</a>"" and the ba-dada ba-dada sax punches of ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/1hDbpF4Mvkw?t=1m6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Modern Love</a>,"" a song from which Boeckner generously paraphrased lyrically on the single ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/TM5MotkKwS0?t=59s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ecstasy at My House</a>"" last year. Boeckner has a history of brazenly overindulging on influences: with Handsome Furs' ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11117-all-we-want-baby-is-everything/"" target=""_blank"">All We Want, Baby, Is Everything</a>,"" he borrowed so heavily that the need to legally clear a song with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a> <a href=""http://wolfparade.nonstuff.com/2008/12/31/news-news-news-5/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reportedly delayed the Furs' second album</a>. Speaking of New Order, <a href=""https://youtu.be/yOsL16fcBXs?t=49s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter Hook's bass sound</a> is all over <i>Blue Wave </i>too.</p>
<p>There are times when Boeckner's phrasing feels so stylized that it borders on unnatural: nobody really says ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/jINMbWeXhp4?t=26s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gown</a>"" in a way that rhymes with ""phone."" But this is what dedication sounds like. Towards the end of the album, Boeckner delivers a telling line in the song, ""Nobody,"" when he sings, ""I rip my life up and tear it apart/Before I start."" This is his thing, violent reinvention, and he'll likely do it again with the upcoming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63994-wolf-parade-announce-apologies-to-the-queen-mary-deluxe-reissue-expand-tour/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade reunion</a>. Here's hoping that he comes back to Operators, though if the last line of the album is any indication, it won't be for a while. ""Wake up with me,"" he sings. And like that, the dream is over.</p></div>"|21851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21851-blue-wave/|7.5|Pat Healy

""Let history repeat / in parallel lines,"" she sang on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18907-katy-b-little-red/"">Little Red</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s ""5 AM,"" describing not only the small infinities implied by dance music but the recursive structure of desire itself.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On her new album, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Honey</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Katy B seems to want to sublimate herself even further into the texture of her music, as if to emphasize the distinct rooms she finds herself in; each of the producers and singers she works with on the album receives equal credit with her, and most of them are located deep with the roster of Rinse FM, the radio station/label that’s released each of her records. She isn’t lost so easily. The album’s centerpiece is a collaboration with jackin’ house producer Chris Lorenzo called ""I Wanna Be,"" the instrumental of the which has been floating around the internet since 2014. Katy B gives the diffuse beat gravity and narrative drama; it ceases to be a tightly-cropped brightness and unfolds and shimmers into a complete emotional landscape. ""I wanna tell you / but anxiety’s a bitch babe,"" she sings, unlocking inner melodies and tensions from otherwise iridescent, smooth house.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Where </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Little Red</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> saw Katy throwing herself into the occasional ballad, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Honey</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is reduced to a pure set of dance music; within these aesthetic limits, though, it may be her most varied record stylistically. On ""So Far Away,"" produced by Wilkinson, drum and bass production gathers and collides together, and Katy weaves through it in deliberate swerves. ""Calm Down,"" written with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28145-floating-points/"">Floating Points</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>, features strings that saw crisply through the track and then rematerialize in ribbony masses. Only on ""Lose Your Head,"" with grime MCs J Hus and D Double E, does Katy B feel like a hook singer on her own song, which causes it feels drawn from an entirely different order of work. Because of the wide range of producers, the songs on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Honey</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can feel unrelated to each other, and often settle together indifferently.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oddly enough </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Honey</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> starts to snap into focus on a track originally released last year as a single by KDA, ""Turn the Music Louder (Rumble),"" itself a vocal rework of an earlier instrumental; on the album version, Tinie Tempeh is subtracted from the song, and Katy B draws the verses and chorus of the song into a subterranean gravity.  Songs like these show Katy B at her best, caught up in the flow of something so overwhelming she can’t see the beginning or the end of it, time expanding and collapsing with her in its center.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Little Red</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the ideal way of hearing </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Honey</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is in its continuous mix, but where </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Little Red</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s arranged all of its album and bonus tracks into a kind of diagram of a long, frustrating night out, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Honey</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s continuous mix merely places opaque tempo shifts between each song. Regardless, the album feels more connected and coherent when experienced in this way, when the listener is allowed to enter a portal before the next distinct context asserts itself, and where Katy herself feels like she’s stretching seamlessly from one dimension into another.</span></p></div>"|21848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21848-honey/|7.0|Brad Nelson

With a few exceptions, the guitar started out as a crude generator of exciting noise and dance energy—a fundamentally teenage sound. Then it gradually became an ever more subtle expressive implement, with a huge textural range. Synths, in contrast, started out prog: they cost a fortune and were challenging to operate, and this made them the preserve of established performers generally of virtuosic and artistically ambitious bent. Either that, or synthesizers belonged to institutions like universities and were accessible only to composers with equally lofty purposes in mind.</p>
<p>The primitivist phase of the synthesizer came <i>after</i> the sophisticated start. In the late 1970s, cheaper machines like the Wasp became available; they were also compact, portable, and relatively user-friendly compared with their bulky predecessors. This democratization of electronics happened to coincide with rock’s own self-conscious return to juvenile basics in the form of punk. All of a sudden, the synth was competing with the guitar to be the true instrument of do-it-yourself. For many, the synth won that contest handily—you didn’t even need to learn two chords, you could riff out abstract blurts of nasty noise or play one-finger melodies. Furthermore, synths and the rudimentary drum machines that were also newly available encouraged a “non-musical” (at least in rock terms) approach. Rather than jam your way to a song through the intuitive logic of groove and feel, tracks could be built up through addition and subtraction, using a hypnotic but uninflected machine-beat as a grid for the assembly process.</p>
<p><i>Close To the Noise Floor</i> is a 4xCD survey of the excitingly messy birth of British electronica during the late '70s and early '80s. One of the maps for the set compiler Richard Anderson used is “Wild Planet,” a celebrated three-part feature written by Dave Henderson for the music weekly <i>Sounds</i>. The 1983 article spawned a regular <i>Sounds </i>column dedicated to the cassette underground of tiny labels like Flowmotion and Third Mind. Henderson contributes a short but vivid memoir-style introduction to this box set and also features in his musical guise as a member of Worldbackwards, a group whose ambition was to sound like “Throbbing Gristle on Tamla Motown.”</p>
<p>“Minimal synth” works as a shorthand tag for <i>Close To the Noise Floor</i>’s remit, although the scope of the trawl is actually wider and more disparate than what that term tends to signify, taking in electro-punk, industrial, synthpop, dark ambient, and more. Rather than use generic focus as an organizing principle, the anthology achieves coherence through sticking with a single country—Britain—when it could have easily have swept across the equally active European scene or harvested the scattered but significant American exponents like John Bender and Nervous Gender.</p>
<p>The national focus makes sense historically, in so far as the UK scene was catalyzed by half-a-dozen native outfits who released debut singles within a few months of each other in mid-1978: the Normal, Human League, Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, Thomas Leer, and Robert Rental. The combined impact of these singles—respectively “T.V.O.D.,” “Being Boiled,” “United,” the <i>Extended Play</i> EP, “Private Plane,” and “Paralysis”—was as galvanizing as Buzzcocks’s “Spiral Scratch” had been for scrappy DIY guitar-groups a year earlier.</p>
<p><i>Noise Floor</i>’s first disc concentrates on the children of Throbbing Gristle and “Warm Leatherette” (the more influential B-side to The Normal’s “T.V.O.D.”). No spacey ripples or groovy Moogy sensuality here: the synth is used aggressively and obnoxiously. One gem in this vein is Storm Bugs’ “Little Bob Minor,"" with its ear-itching drones whose texture resembles a comb-and-paper kazoo. Vocals, when they appear, are usually screams or creepy spoken-word soundbites, as with the cut-up voices from a radio interview with prostitutes that appear on We Be Echo’s “Sexuality.”</p>
<p>The stand-out track on the first disc, though, is a bit of an anomaly: Thomas Leer’s “Tight As a Drum,” from his fabulous EP <i>4 Movements</i>. By 1981, Leer had left behind the gratingly foreboding ambiences of <i>The Bridge</i>, his collaborative album with Robert Rental, and absorbed the mutant disco influence of New York’s ZE label. <i>4 Movements</i> also sounds like he’s letting back in some of the banished musicality of pre-punk rock, figures like Island Records folk-blues minstrel John Martyn. “Tight As a Drum” swings because although the percussion is electronic, Leer played it by hand on pads; the intricate weave of synth-melodies over the top sounds vaguely Middle Eastern in its ornamented filigree. The song seems to reach your ears through the heat-haze coming off a sun-baked road. A snapshot of a moment of tension so exquisitely taut it’s a kind of ecstasy, “Tight As a Drum” features the briefest of spoken-not-sung lyrics: a depiction of a young man stretching himself, silhouetted against the morning light streaming through a window.</p>
<p>Embracing mainstream ideas of melody and musicality doesn’t work so well on the second disc, which mostly features groups who reach towards pop but don’t get even as close as the Human League did on “Being Boiled” (included here). Performance art duo SchleImer K’s “Broken Vein” suggests Soft Cell sans the soaring voice and heart-swelling tunes; Native Europe’s “The Distance from Köln” is a lo-fi cousin to Berlin’s '80s radio staple “The Metro”; lyrically if not so much sonically, Cultural Amnesia’s 1981 anti-Thatcherism ditty “Materialistic Man” comes over like a dry run for Depeche Mode’s “Everything Counts."" The better tunes come from those who actually managed to make it as pop stars. “A New Kind of Man,” an unreleased solo single by ex-Ultravox singer John Foxx, features a vocal that—typical for the emerging synthpop genre—sounds glacial and torrid at the same time, plus lyrics like scraps from an abandoned and torn-up screenplay: “An underwater kind of silence/Humming of electric pylons/Don’t forget me/Fits of static/Another scene began.” Heard in its superior 1980 album version rather than original incarnation, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark’s “Almost” sounds like a spindly North-of-England Kraftwerk—graph-paper rhythm, sobbing synth.</p>
<p>Livening up the second disc—otherwise a bit of slog—are specimens from the post-punk mini-genre of parody. The late '70s erupted with cover versions that swapped reverent reinterpretation for willfully goofy travesty—think Flying Lizards’ deadpan take on “Money,“ or the Dickies’s punked-up “Nights in White Satin.” The idea, I think, was to show just how much distance there was now between Old Wave and New Wave—or, if the cover was of a contemporary hit, how far from chart-pop convention you could push the song.</p>
<p>That’s the nature of the game with British Standard Unit’s deconstructive molesting of Rod Stewart’s “D’Ya Think I’m Sexy,” which became a John Peel radio show fave in 1979 with its grotesquely sped-up voices and anti-disco jerkiness. B.S.U. was just one of numerous guises worn by ex-Mott the Hoople keyboard player Morgan Fisher for a covers album project called <i>Hybrid Kids - A Collection of Classic Mutants</i>. “Gerry and the Holograms,” by the group of the same name, isn’t a cover but a lampoon of the emergent synthpop genre itself, wrought by two members of the cult band Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias (whose output consisted almost entirely of parodies such as their punk-mocking <i>Snuff Rock</i> EP). “Gerry and the Holograms” has been identified as the melodic source for New Order’s “Blue Monday,” but to these ears sounds more like The Stooges’s “I Wanna Be Your Dog” covered by BBC Radiophonic Workshop. In a word, awesome.</p>
<p>That pair of whimsies could equally have been squeezed onto the last disc of <i>Close To the Noise Floor</i>, which corrals an array of unclassifiable oddities. Although electronic in feel, more often than not the sounds here are achieved via conventional instruments subjected to heavy treatments. Here the forebears, if any exist, are the Residents and Cabaret Voltaire (who in their early days used effects-processed flute and guitar more than synths). Renaldo and the Loaf’s “Dying Inside” sounds ripe for sampling by Kanye West on <i>Pablo II</i>. Unable to afford synths, the duo used effects pedals to render their instruments and voices as inorganic and alien-sounding as possible. Alien Brains’ “Menial Disorders” has a great backstory (the project started in the physics lab at the group’s high school and mainly deployed a “Loopotron,” a self-cobbled tape-echo machine that used the erase head to alter the sound) which is matched by the sound itself : a cloud of mechanical gnats circling around your head, fizzing zig-zags of hi-hat, corrugated crumples of texture, rhythm like bed springs pinging inside a giant reverberant cistern.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Noise Floor</i>’s contents are shaped by twin prohibitions. First and foremost, the goal was to sound as un-rock’n’roll and un-American as possible (which is why the vocals, when they appear, are usually absurdly English—stiff-backed, groomed-sounding, somehow short-haired). But there was a secondary impulse at work too: to break with the conventions of synth-based music established in the first half of the ’70s by groups like Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze, who favored long-form compositions (often taking up an entire album side) and an atmosphere of celestial serenity.</p>
<p>Now you might have noticed that I jumped right past this box’s third disc. That’s because in some ways it’s the most intriguing of the four, precisely because it’s full of post-punk DIY that still took its bearings from the pre-punk electronic cosmonauts. Maximal Synth, you could call this stuff: operators like Sea of Wires, MFH, and Mark Shreeve, who, rather than ape “Warm Leatherette” or Cabaret Voltaire’s “Silent Command,"" parallel the billowing pulse-scapes being made at that same time by Manuel Gottsching on albums like 1978’s <i>Blackouts</i>. This sound—late period <i>kosmische</i> drifting towards New Age or proto-techno—has in recent years enjoyed a measure of renewed currency thanks to Emeralds and their ilk, but generally it’s been written right out of history.</p>
<p>One of the groups included on Disc 3 are actually a totally pre-punk proposition. Zorch took their battery of EMS Synthi As and light show to free festivals all across England, including the very first Stonehenge Festival in 1974. Hearing their “Adrenalin (Return of the Elohim Pt. 1)” made me wish for a time machine so I could experience its spaceship-landing whooshes panning around the megalithic columns and frazzling the minds of the gathered long-hairs. In a similar amorphous vein, Ron Berry’s “Sea of Tranquility” is an elegiac homage to the Moon Landing. But “Triptych” by EG Oblique Graph (Bryn Jones, later better known as Muslimgauze) is less beatific, recalling the sensory-deprivation aesthetic of Conrad Schnitzler: insidiously hissing percussion and color-leached tones, like a wintry after-dark walk through a Berlin pedestrian underpass.</p>
<p>Despite the omission of obvious classics like “Warm Leatherette” or Fad Gadget’s “Ricky’s Hand” (presumably because the Mute label archive was off-limits to the compiler) <i>Close To the Noise Floor</i> provides a fascinating overview of the formative years of British home-studio electronica: groups who were precursors in spirit, if not direct lineage, to the techno and IDM artists of the ’90s. Still, with the cult for “minimal wave” now a decade old, it almost feels like another task has become urgent: the rediscovery of the groups that did the groundwork for the outfits on Disc 3 of <i>Noise Floor</i>. Time, perhaps, for a box set that does justice to major label synth-rock of the ’70s: figures like Tomita, pre-<i>Chariots of Fire</i> Vangelis, Michael Hoenig, Ralph Lundsten, even Jean Michel-Jarre. Rather than the underground, which enjoys a healthy complement of dedicated curators and salvage operators, it’s the mainstream of that era that is truly lost, that in a strange way seems even more exotic and remote in time.</p></div>"|21653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21653-close-to-the-noise-floor-formative-uk-electronica-1975-1984/|8.1|Simon Reynolds

Up until now, Holy Ghost!'s arguable greatest achievement was their debut single, ""Hold On,"" a track brilliant enough to carry the band from its release in 2007 to their debut album four years later. The four sprawling, joyous dance tracks on <i>Crime Cutz</i> finally follow up ""Hold On"" with something equally substantial. It's a bright, tight, tense mini-epic, solidifying the band as one of the pillars of the mid-'00s disco resurgence.</p>
<p>The EP's titular opener begins with a drudged-out minute of spacey synths before bursting into full-fledged disco: arpeggiated synthesizers, falsettos, super-dry guitar riffs, an angelic choir of diva vocals, and a hands-to-the-heavens chorus of ""You lift me up and up! Up and off the floor!"" Many of these elements could be regarded as pure retro revivalism, but Holy Ghost!'s touch is light enough to make the song transcend its obvious crib notes. </p>
<p><i>Crime Cutz </i>doesn't draw only from disco, however. There's a distinct '80s-pop aura permeating the record, courtesy of over-the-top pop arrangements and frontman Alex Frankel's earnest blue-eyed R&amp;B<i> </i>vocal style. ""Stereotype"" recalls old-school dancefloor staples from the likes of Colonel Abrams, Rockwell, and even Jermaine Stewart, gems from the post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11163-thriller-25th-anniversary-edition/"">Thriller</a> R&amp;B boom that produced countless hits. Frankel sings with the uninhibited glee of someone karaoke-ing ""P.Y.T."" at a high school house party circa 1984. ""I know I'm a stereotype,"" he croons, ""don't be so critical […] Let go."" You'd expect nothing but seriousness from a band that is this on top of their history, but they understand that half of what makes this type of music fun is its abandon.</p>
<p>Another highlight, ""Compass Point,"" adds another instrumental layer with a welcome and  unexpected surge of horns near the end. If anything, <i>Crime Cutz</i>'s weakness lies in its lack of diversity—you spend a lot of the record hoping for something to take them even further over the edge, but they continue to pull back until the very end. ""Footsteps,"" the record's closer, is the only track that slightly misses the mark, leaning a little too heavily on all the touchstones mentioned above. It barely touches the overall effect of <i>Crime Cutz</i>, though, and if this EP is indeed a precursor to a new full length,we have reason to be excited. </p></div>"|21813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21813-crime-cutz/|7.0|Cameron Cook

But the Windy City rapper born David Cohn is best known as someone else entirely—Kenny Dennis, the aging rapper he dreamed up, the one who hates Shaq but loves the '85 Chicago Bears, his wife Jueles, O’Douls, brats, beers, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqrtoFWglMY&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLNrNSYbYRUtgByv1OGk2uUja5SgzvK-M5"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the actor Brian Dennehy</a>. </p>
<p>Kenny isn’t a joke, and he isn’t a one-off; he’s been animated on a handful of full-length records and a masterful EP, and even the fictitious rap group Kenny was supposed to be a member of  during the early '90s got its own, very real album. Kenny has hopes, fears, insecurities, blind spots. In short, Cohn knows how to build worlds. </p>
<p><i>Testarossa, </i>the second-full length collaboration between Cohn and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4593-why/"">WHY?</a>’s Yoni Wolf, credits the rapper as Serengeti. While swapping one stage name for another is not necessarily truth-telling, it’s implied that when compared to Kenny Dennis, Serengeti more closely approximates the feelings and experiences of David Cohn. But when Geti lets you into his own psyche, it’s through fractured narratives and half-truths, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjVpxbfuEoA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ill-advised blogging ventures</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rIWwfZFI0k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">apocryphal trips to the hardware store</a>. The last Geti/Yoni LP, 2011’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15639-family-and-friends/""> <i>Family &amp; Friends</i></a>, was intermittently brilliant, but also unremittingly dark. (The standout song from that record, ""The Whip,"" is a portrait of a retired UFC fighter trying desperately to get back in the octagon.) The sequel has fewer songs that are obvious conceptual departures, but finds Geti just as slippery, just as evasive.</p>
<p>The album follows a narrative of sorts, purportedly based on a script that Geti and Yoni co-wrote about a fledgling musician who leaves his wife and young children at home to head out on tour, only to watch his family dissolve from afar. As always, Cohn finds the emotional weight of the story in the crevices: in the weight he gained one winter with his wife, in the rental cars he uses to assume new identities in new towns. On ""I, Testarossa,"" his character wrings his hands over the length of his daughter’s bangs and shoves bills into a jukebox to make strangers dance. </p>
<p>The production and Wolf’s vocals are lush and subdued to where the story feels like one long dream sequence. Its best moments come when Geti yanks you violently into a scene, like he does during a conversation with a girl outside a venue on ""Down"": ""I’m waiting for Yoni outside in a coat/ Smelling like coke, sipping on a smoke/ Talking to a young girl, trying to steal hope/ Leaning in like the pope/ ‘Yo, let’s get down.’"" There’s that economy of language, that willingness to sneak vials into the Vatican that make him one of rap’s sharpest writers. Unfortunately, moments like that are too infrequent on the album’s spare front half. But in the suite that ends <i>Testarossa</i>, Geti waxes romantic about homework folders and Google Plus in a way that feels more intimate than any revelations about his childhood could hope to be.</p></div>"|21903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21903-testarossa/|7.2|Paul A.

The same goes if you're arriving at this set straight from the brand new EP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21791-blind-spot-ep/"">Blind Spot</a></i>, Lush's first recorded output after a 20-year absence. Conversely, back in 1989-90, when Lush's debut EP <i>Scar</i> first made a splash, it was tempting to dismiss the English quartet's music as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a> knockoff—but only if you focused on skin-deep similarities rather than the character underneath the sound.</p>
<p>The first record in this set is <i>Gala</i>, a re-packaging of <i>Scar</i> and two other EPs released together in 1990 to function as the band's introduction to new audiences. Sequenced in backwards chronological order, <i>Gala</i> allowed the uninitiated to stumble onto the demo-like crudeness of <i>Scar</i> after being won-over by the radiant shimmer of songs like ""Sweetness and Light"" and ""De-Luxe."" Those songs came across as something of a revelation if you were unfamiliar with Lush's influences and were listening through the lens of alternative rock's transition to a hard-driving, heavy guitar-based format. With six songs produced by Cocteau Twins co-founder Robin Guthrie, <i>Gala</i> still has the naive air of a band fumbling for its voice in the shadow of its heroes. Nevertheless, on the first seven songs, the band throws down the gauntlet and asserts all of the traits that have established its sound as timeless.</p>
<p>The second record of the set is Lush's first proper full-length, 1992's <i>Spooky</i>. Here, it becomes quite clear that this band possessed the substance to match its style. As part of the wave of British acts that were first slapped with the shoegaze tag—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3574-ride/"">Ride</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a>, and Pale Saints among them—Lush's music was naturally defined by its seemingly endless ripples of delay, reverb, flange, and chorus. But the almost-supernatural power of frontwoman/guitarist Miki Berenyi and lead guitarist/vocalist Emma Anderson's vocal harmonies and intertwining guitar work set Lush apart from the shoegaze pack on a number of levels.</p>
<p>After a brief intro, <i>Spooky</i> launches straight into the stratosphere with ""Nothing Natural,"" a pinnacle moment not only for Lush but for shoegaze/alternative across the board. Although Guthrie brings his soft-focus production once again, no amount of sonic soft-pedaling can contain the band's assuredness as it aspires to—and mostly reaches—a beauty so sublime that it pumps you up as much as it takes your breath away. Sure, Lush made melancholy, ethereal music, but such was the band's range during this period that none of the songs on <i>Spooky</i> conform strictly to one mood.</p>
<p>By turns dour, impatient, hopeful, and resigned, the album never runs out of shades. Uptempo numbers like ""Laura"" and ""Superblast!"" counterbalance the more reflective moments, which hit hardest on album closer ""Monochrome,"" a song with a swaying underwater groove. In the chorus, Berenyi sings, ""And sometimes I think if I stand by the phone it may ring/ And sometimes I worry and fear what tomorrow may bring,"" her voice drenched in reverb so she sounds less like a human than an apparition. It is one of several moments on <i>Spooky</i> where Lush's music verges on mind-altering.</p>
<p>As the band's sole songwriters, Anderson and Berenyi each took unorthodox approaches to melody, chord structure, pacing, lyrics, and even guitar strumming. With Lush, they wove their idiosyncrasies together into a sound whose rough edge belies its delicate outer lacing. The pair was especially fond of inserting odd notes into chords that draped even their most delicate songs in a haze of dissonance. And if you refer to bootleg recordings from the band's heyday, it's evident that Lush packed a punch in concert that none of these records quite capture. Most unfortunately, you can listen to this whole reissue set and never get a sense of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIalXc0RDF0&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">assertive</a>, even <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBfiYCyPSFM&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">forceful</a> playing of late drummer Chris Acland, whose suicide in October of '96 stopped Lush's career in its tracks just as Anderson was contemplating quitting and collective morale had begun wane.</p>
<p>Had Acland not ended his own life, it seems like an implosion was imminent anyway—which is strange considering that Lush's third and final full-length, 1996's <i>Lovelife</i>, triggered a spike in commercial success in the UK. By <i>Lovelife</i>, however, Berenyi and Anderson had abandoned what originally made their music appealing in favor of a more streamlined sound <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpsdhC0r914&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m8s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hewing towards</a> Britpop. While a tune like Anderson's ""500 (Shake Baby Shake)"" distills the familiar harmonies into a tight, sugary-sweet package, which only makes the song's underlying sarcasm and faux-vapidity all the more biting, a multi-faceted muse like Anderson's wasn't best served by going down the same path as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3414-pulp/"">Pulp</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a>. Frankly, she and Berenyi were more capable than that.</p>
<p>At a crucial midpoint between the beginning and the end, 1994's <i>Split</i> documents the band reaching beyond the shoegaze mold but not yet pandering to pop appeal. By all accounts a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/03/lush-reunited-we-were-seen-as-a-band-whod-turn-up-to-the-opening-of-a-packet-of-crisps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">difficult process</a> that involved repeated attempts at a final mix, <i>Split</i> benefits from the turmoil. By that point, Anderson and Berenyi's romantic outlooks had darkened considerably, and at times—the languid, seven-and-a-half minute ""Desire Lines,"" a plea to a person who needs help on ""Undertow""—Split simulates the sensation of being emotionally lost, adrift on a sea of uncertainty and woe. On those songs, the pair's guitars are like waves lapping against the side of a boat going nowhere.</p>
<p>The final disc, a collection of <i>Lovelife</i>-era B-sides originally released (in two versions) in Canada and Japan as <i>Topolino</i>, largely follows in the direction of <i>Lovelife</i> and then veers off course with delightfully varied results. It's a breath of fresh air, for example, when Lush delve into their signature guitar glitter on ""I Have the Moon."" Meanwhile, on ""Plums and Oranges"" (one of a slew of digital bonus tracks, all of which also appear on the recent 5-cd box set <i>Chorus</i>), the band seamlessly transplants its classic sound onto an electronic framework—a tantalizing hint of what might have been had Lush had more time to experiment. Likewise, ""Matador"" and ""I'd Like to Walk Around in Your Mind"" see the band venturing into a pastoral English folk arena one wishes Berenyi and Anderson would have explored more.</p>
<p>It's frustrating, because the stripped-down simplicity of ""Carmen""—a chipper rock ditty that sounds like it was rescued by the spirit of Juliana Hatfield on its way to becoming a Britpop single—proves that Lush could have sailed right past the trends of the day. In truth, <i>Topolino</i> serves as a postscript, rather than the meat, of a remarkable career, but its charming odds and ends reveal myriad new angles on the band. Even the instrumental cocktail jazz of ""Cul De Sac"" stumbles its way into grace somehow, and the album's haphazard running order caps the listening experience off on a surprisingly carefree note.</p>
<p>Of course, <i>Origami</i> establishes Lush's place in the lineage of guitar rock well before you get to the <i>Topolino</i> record. Anchored by Anderson and Berenyi's songwriting acumen, Lush's music didn't lunge at the jugular quite like the work of more audacious sonic innovators like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"">Jesus and Mary Chain</a>. But, in a strange way, time has proven to be on Lush's side. Two-plus decades later, bands have gotten rather adept at reproducing the sound and attitude that this box documents so vividly. Nevertheless, Lush's body of work reminds us that all the guitar pedals in the world amount to little more than window dressing if you don't have the heart and soul to harness them. With <i>Origami</i>, it's perhaps more clear than ever that Lush possessed both in spades.</p>

The same goes if you're arriving at this set straight from the brand new EP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21791-blind-spot-ep/"">Blind Spot</a></i>, Lush's first recorded output after a 20-year absence. Conversely, back in 1989-90, when Lush's debut EP <i>Scar</i> first made a splash, it was tempting to dismiss the English quartet's music as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a> knockoff—but only if you focused on skin-deep similarities rather than the character underneath the sound.</p>
<p>The first record in this set is <i>Gala</i>, a re-packaging of <i>Scar</i> and two other EPs released together in 1990 to function as the band's introduction to new audiences. Sequenced in backwards chronological order, <i>Gala</i> allowed the uninitiated to stumble onto the demo-like crudeness of <i>Scar</i> after being won-over by the radiant shimmer of songs like ""Sweetness and Light"" and ""De-Luxe."" Those songs came across as something of a revelation if you were unfamiliar with Lush's influences and were listening through the lens of alternative rock's transition to a hard-driving, heavy guitar-based format. With six songs produced by Cocteau Twins co-founder Robin Guthrie, <i>Gala</i> still has the naive air of a band fumbling for its voice in the shadow of its heroes. Nevertheless, on the first seven songs, the band throws down the gauntlet and asserts all of the traits that have established its sound as timeless.</p>
<p>The second record of the set is Lush's first proper full-length, 1992's <i>Spooky</i>. Here, it becomes quite clear that this band possessed the substance to match its style. As part of the wave of British acts that were first slapped with the shoegaze tag—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3574-ride/"">Ride</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a>, and Pale Saints among them—Lush's music was naturally defined by its seemingly endless ripples of delay, reverb, flange, and chorus. But the almost-supernatural power of frontwoman/guitarist Miki Berenyi and lead guitarist/vocalist Emma Anderson's vocal harmonies and intertwining guitar work set Lush apart from the shoegaze pack on a number of levels.</p>
<p>After a brief intro, <i>Spooky</i> launches straight into the stratosphere with ""Nothing Natural,"" a pinnacle moment not only for Lush but for shoegaze/alternative across the board. Although Guthrie brings his soft-focus production once again, no amount of sonic soft-pedaling can contain the band's assuredness as it aspires to—and mostly reaches—a beauty so sublime that it pumps you up as much as it takes your breath away. Sure, Lush made melancholy, ethereal music, but such was the band's range during this period that none of the songs on <i>Spooky</i> conform strictly to one mood.</p>
<p>By turns dour, impatient, hopeful, and resigned, the album never runs out of shades. Uptempo numbers like ""Laura"" and ""Superblast!"" counterbalance the more reflective moments, which hit hardest on album closer ""Monochrome,"" a song with a swaying underwater groove. In the chorus, Berenyi sings, ""And sometimes I think if I stand by the phone it may ring/ And sometimes I worry and fear what tomorrow may bring,"" her voice drenched in reverb so she sounds less like a human than an apparition. It is one of several moments on <i>Spooky</i> where Lush's music verges on mind-altering.</p>
<p>As the band's sole songwriters, Anderson and Berenyi each took unorthodox approaches to melody, chord structure, pacing, lyrics, and even guitar strumming. With Lush, they wove their idiosyncrasies together into a sound whose rough edge belies its delicate outer lacing. The pair was especially fond of inserting odd notes into chords that draped even their most delicate songs in a haze of dissonance. And if you refer to bootleg recordings from the band's heyday, it's evident that Lush packed a punch in concert that none of these records quite capture. Most unfortunately, you can listen to this whole reissue set and never get a sense of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIalXc0RDF0&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">assertive</a>, even <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBfiYCyPSFM&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">forceful</a> playing of late drummer Chris Acland, whose suicide in October of '96 stopped Lush's career in its tracks just as Anderson was contemplating quitting and collective morale had begun wane.</p>
<p>Had Acland not ended his own life, it seems like an implosion was imminent anyway—which is strange considering that Lush's third and final full-length, 1996's <i>Lovelife</i>, triggered a spike in commercial success in the UK. By <i>Lovelife</i>, however, Berenyi and Anderson had abandoned what originally made their music appealing in favor of a more streamlined sound <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpsdhC0r914&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m8s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hewing towards</a> Britpop. While a tune like Anderson's ""500 (Shake Baby Shake)"" distills the familiar harmonies into a tight, sugary-sweet package, which only makes the song's underlying sarcasm and faux-vapidity all the more biting, a multi-faceted muse like Anderson's wasn't best served by going down the same path as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3414-pulp/"">Pulp</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a>. Frankly, she and Berenyi were more capable than that.</p>
<p>At a crucial midpoint between the beginning and the end, 1994's <i>Split</i> documents the band reaching beyond the shoegaze mold but not yet pandering to pop appeal. By all accounts a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/03/lush-reunited-we-were-seen-as-a-band-whod-turn-up-to-the-opening-of-a-packet-of-crisps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">difficult process</a> that involved repeated attempts at a final mix, <i>Split</i> benefits from the turmoil. By that point, Anderson and Berenyi's romantic outlooks had darkened considerably, and at times—the languid, seven-and-a-half minute ""Desire Lines,"" a plea to a person who needs help on ""Undertow""—Split simulates the sensation of being emotionally lost, adrift on a sea of uncertainty and woe. On those songs, the pair's guitars are like waves lapping against the side of a boat going nowhere.</p>
<p>The final disc, a collection of <i>Lovelife</i>-era B-sides originally released (in two versions) in Canada and Japan as <i>Topolino</i>, largely follows in the direction of <i>Lovelife</i> and then veers off course with delightfully varied results. It's a breath of fresh air, for example, when Lush delve into their signature guitar glitter on ""I Have the Moon."" Meanwhile, on ""Plums and Oranges"" (one of a slew of digital bonus tracks, all of which also appear on the recent 5-cd box set <i>Chorus</i>), the band seamlessly transplants its classic sound onto an electronic framework—a tantalizing hint of what might have been had Lush had more time to experiment. Likewise, ""Matador"" and ""I'd Like to Walk Around in Your Mind"" see the band venturing into a pastoral English folk arena one wishes Berenyi and Anderson would have explored more.</p>
<p>It's frustrating, because the stripped-down simplicity of ""Carmen""—a chipper rock ditty that sounds like it was rescued by the spirit of Juliana Hatfield on its way to becoming a Britpop single—proves that Lush could have sailed right past the trends of the day. In truth, <i>Topolino</i> serves as a postscript, rather than the meat, of a remarkable career, but its charming odds and ends reveal myriad new angles on the band. Even the instrumental cocktail jazz of ""Cul De Sac"" stumbles its way into grace somehow, and the album's haphazard running order caps the listening experience off on a surprisingly carefree note.</p>
<p>Of course, <i>Origami</i> establishes Lush's place in the lineage of guitar rock well before you get to the <i>Topolino</i> record. Anchored by Anderson and Berenyi's songwriting acumen, Lush's music didn't lunge at the jugular quite like the work of more audacious sonic innovators like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"">Jesus and Mary Chain</a>. But, in a strange way, time has proven to be on Lush's side. Two-plus decades later, bands have gotten rather adept at reproducing the sound and attitude that this box documents so vividly. Nevertheless, Lush's body of work reminds us that all the guitar pedals in the world amount to little more than window dressing if you don't have the heart and soul to harness them. With <i>Origami</i>, it's perhaps more clear than ever that Lush possessed both in spades.</p>

With <i>Origami</i>, it's perhaps more clear than ever that Lush possessed both in spades.</p>

<p><i>“There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one’s self.” — Benjamin Franklin</i></p>
<p><i>“I’ve always been me, I guess I know myself.” — Drake</i></p>
<p>Know yourself, the theory goes, and you will know all. The world will open up to you. Existence will be made plain. You will be one with the matrix. Yadda yadda yadda. From arenas to memes, Drake has always had a skill for turning his innermost thoughts, feelings, and anxieties into breakthrough group therapy sessions—he articulates what we know to be true and then lets us rap or sing those truths en masse, exalting in common bonds that are as vulnerable as they are revealing. When he confides his fears, we become a little more fearless. When he turns his woes into anthems, we all get lifted. But there is a razor-sharp line between self-awareness and self-absorption: Whereas self-awareness can expand wisdom by reflecting it outward, self-absorption often festers, drawing things in only to let them rot. For the past seven years, Drake has expertly glided along that line. But on his fourth proper album, he edges closer than ever to a mirrored abyss, a suffocating echo chamber of self.</p>
<p>The record is called <i>VIEWS</i> but its perspective is decidedly singular. “This album, I’m very proud to say, is just—I feel like I told everybody how <i>I’m</i> actually feeling,” Drake told Zane Lowe in a toothless recent interview, differentiating <i>VIEWS</i> from his previous work. This might seem like a ridiculous distinction—there’s never any question that Drake is the star of his own show—but it’s apt, and it hints at why this album feels like more of a claustrophobic mindfuck than a collective catharsis. <i>VIEWS</i> is what happens when venting turns into whining. Spanning an obnoxious 82 minutes, the record goes through several musical and thematic phases, but the overall atmosphere is bitter, petty, worn-down. It confuses loyalty and stagnation, wallowing in a sound that is starting to show its limits.</p>
<p>Until the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/65134-drakes-new-album-is-now-titled-just-views/"">last minute</a>, the album was to be called <i>Views from the 6</i>, and it still serves as an ode to Drake’s hometown of Toronto. After having other producers handle the lion’s share of beats on his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21102-what-a-time-to-be-alive/"">last</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21102-what-a-time-to-be-alive/"">two</a> mixtapes, Drake's longtime musical consigliere, Noah “40” Shebib, returns to the head of the table here, with production credits on 12 of the album’s 20 tracks. The atmosphere 40 creates with his music is now synonymous with Drake’s Toronto; the harsh chill of winter is brought forth via cold snares and ice-cube synths, with the summer’s relief often rendered through sped-up ‘90s R&amp;B samples that quietly churn in the background. It’s essentially a screwed-down take on Kanye West’s chipmunk soul, and it has provided a perfect backdrop for Drake’s poignant introspection while ushering in an entire stage of hip-hop’s evolution.</p>
<p>But on <i>VIEWS</i>, the style is simply getting tired, its wintry mood now actively blocking any springtime salvation. It’s also bringing out some of Drake’s most self-loathing tendencies, playing into his groaning paranoia on tracks like “9,” where he laments, “Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it/Doesn’t matter where I go, I can never get away from it.” Songs like these play out like dour self-fulfilling prophecies, puffed-up bad attitudes drunk on their own misery. They also expose the downside of a “no new friends” mindset and how a bunker mentality can snub out curiosity. Marked by frigidness and a furrowed brow, much of <i>VIEWS</i> may be true to Toronto’s darker months, but it also makes the city sound like a pretty inhospitable place.</p>
<p>Fact is, the 6 is one of the most multicultural places on Earth, a sprawling metropolis in which more than 140 different languages and dialects are spoken. And it’s when <i>VIEWS</i> embraces this more inviting and open-minded side of Toronto that it points to a better way forward. Drake’s fascination with the city’s Caribbean enclaves take root in the effervescent rhythms of songs like “With You,” “One Dance,” and “Too Good”—all of them featuring welcomed guest vocals that break up the monotony and also allow Drake to get out of his own brain for a second.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a> co-stars on “Too Good,” finally offering a counterpoint to Drake’s constant disappointment with the opposite sex; when she sings “You take my love for granted, I just don’t understand it,” she’s giving voice to all of the women Drake has spurned on record over the years. (Perhaps tellingly, she only gets to sing the line alongside her duet partner.) Because while Drake’s relationship dissections were once questioning and openly hurt, they too have hardened—at this point, it’s getting impossible to believe he’s not the one to blame for so many squandered attempts at love.</p>
<p>Even slight tweaks to Drake’s usual sound pay dividends here. “Childs Play” finds 40 putting his spin on New Orleans bounce, bringing out Drake’s more playful side as he raps about a lady friend who gets in a fight with him at The Cheesecake Factory and takes his <a href=""http://www.bugatti.com/home/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bugatti</a> for a spin to pick up some tampons. The song’s angst plays out more like a jokey spat than another existential treatise on the hopelessness of searching for the girl of his dreams. “Feel No Ways” is another sad story, but its beat—which zips up Malcolm McClaren’s 1983 hip-hop experiment “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq_dDiLZl38"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World’s Famous</a>”—harkens back to Drake’s masterpiece, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16039-take-care/"">Take Care</a></i>, adding levity and the sense that these feelings, like all feelings, will not be so heavy in time. “Weston Road Flows” is another throwback, with Drake reminiscing about his salad days over a gorgeous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7717-mary-j-blige/"">Mary J. Blige</a> sample, another instance of a woman’s voice helping to add humanity to the rapper’s toughened exterior. The song finds Drake looking back on his come-up with fondness and, naturally, some melancholy. But when he lets out a little cackle at the end of the track, it’s not out of spite. He sounds like he’s genuinely enjoying himself on the song. It’s nice to hear.</p>
<p>If last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20271-if-youre-reading-this-its-too-late/"">If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late</a></i> had Drake doing his best all-guns-blazing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2wD5TaMf2k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tony Montana</a>, shedding his softness for an untouchable-don pose, <i>VIEWS</i> has him on his Tony Soprano, trying to reach deep into his own psyche for revelations but often just falling back on a sour version of what got him this far. Perhaps its shortcomings are in part due to a cloistered view of what being candid really means. “I’m an honest person, I can’t write fiction,” Drake said last week. “It all directly has to do with me or else I can’t make the music.” While artistic honesty is certainly something to aspire to, it doesn’t have to equate with blinding selfishness or even concrete reality. Drake’s most apparent current rap peers, Kanye and Kendrick Lamar, have both let their minds wander to surreal places in order to add depth and intrigue to their own music, and nobody would accuse them of dishonesty. Such inventiveness is required for the type of longevity Drake seems to crave. Because knowing thyself is a quest. It never ends.</p></div>"|21836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21836-drake-views/|6.8|Ryan Dombal

The techno and house artists featured by the German label, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"">DJ Koze </a>himself to the underground king <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2142-isolee/"">Isolée</a>, from the madcap experimentalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10842-roman-flugel/"">Roman Flügel</a> to the fan-favorite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1121-dntel/"">Dntel</a>, shun conventional genre wisdom and of-the-moment sounds, instead favoring an approach wrapped in humor, warmth, and the pleasure of small surprises. “All the best things happen from mistakes,” Koze <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/9138-dj-koze/"">told Pitchfork</a> three years ago, in a statement representative of the spontaneity that he’s embraced in heading up the imprint.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the tasting menu represented by the new label compilation <i>Pampa Vol. 1 </i>is incoherent, even with the unexpected appearances of big-name guest stars including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-xx/"">Jamie xx</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"">Matthew Herbert</a>. The 19 tracks that make up this confectioner's array sit in neatly ordered rows, most of them sweet, light, and pleasant, with novel ingredients often cropping in the middle or even near the end of tracks. With a running time of nearly two hours, the compilation shouldn’t be ingested in one go—doing so might bring on the overstuffed achiness of gobbling down a box of chocolates. The offerings on hand here are meant to be picked out at random and savored; <i>Pampa Vol. 1 </i>is the album as discovery machine, rather than completist’s task. It’s as good an album as any to justify the existence of the shuffle setting.</p>
<p>Starting at the beginning may run counter to the record’s freewheeling design, but Matthew Herbert’s remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33079-lianne-la-havas/"">Lianne La Havas</a>’ “Lost and Found” is irresistible as an album opener. In Herbert’s hands, the pain and beauty of the London singer’s 2012 ballad are transmuted, as staircases of bass elevate the track’s more hopeful qualities. If you feel like taking a side entrance, another possible point of immersion is the Swedish house producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31750-axel-boman/"">Axel Boman</a>’s offering, “In the Dust of This Planet.” Boman’s 2010 EP <i>Holy Love</i> was one of Pampa’s first big releases, and the new track is characteristic of the exploratory push that Pampa’s artists receive from the label. Its winding back half, considered by Boman to be its proper ending, interrupts what had been a climactic crescendo. That shift changes the song's entire direction, allowing it to evoke a sense of regret, an actualization of the wish to go back in time and start again.</p>
<p>Newcomers to Pampa may skip right to the Jamie xx offering, “Come We Go,” and thankfully, it’s as good a portal as any into the label’s core values. At first, the track seems as if it’s following the path of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20458-in-colour/"">In Colour</a>’s dance floor fetish. Then, suddenly, the walls close in and the bass becomes claustrophobic. It’s a left turn typical of DJ Koze’s sense of play, and although it’s not entirely clear, he appears to be Jamie’s collaborator on the track, working under the pseudonym Kosi Kos.</p>
<p>Other standouts include the cotton candy world built by the Swiss house veteran Michel Cleis on his contribution, “Un Prince,” <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24450-acid-pauli/"">Acid Pauli</a>’s fractured beauty “Nana,” which dices its sampled melody into thousands of tiny pieces, and Die Vögel’s bizarrely lovely pastoral, ”Everything,” which features the American singer Sophia Kennedy, another track to which Koze contributed something essential (in this case, advising that the beat be pulled out altogether.)</p>
<p>Some tracks don’t make as much sense within the mix, including “I Does It,” a serviceable slab of funk-infused hip-hop from the electronic duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1589-funkstorung/"">Funkstörung</a> that’s aggressive and low-slung in a way that feels out of sync with its airy companions. The crooning that provides the centerpiece of Josef’s “I Wonder,” is so shrill that it makes the track hard to stomach; it seems like a joke that was pushed a bit too far.</p>
<p>The record is bookended by two versions of Roman Flügel’s “9 Years,” the original and Koze’s club remix, which fans may recognize from Flügel’s Essential Mix. Koze’s version is no mere ego trip; if anything he does more justice to the tracks core attributes—its pensiveness, its beauty—than the original. It’s the most obvious example of Koze’s influence on his collaborators, but in the statements included with the press copy of <i>Pampa Vol. 1</i>, several of the artists mention how a suggestion he made helped them finish their tracks. Koze has <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2013/03/27/im-turned-on-by-melancholy-pampa-maverick-dj-koze-talks-amygdala-jennifer-lawrence-and-the-virtues-of-goats/2/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">described the label</a> as a<b> “</b>small family,” a “gang which makes you feel that you’re not alone.” If that’s the case, the new record suggests that he’s operating as the ideal paterfamilias, daring the artists he works with to go beyond their boundaries, to try something unfamiliar, to surprise themselves, and in doing so, to give listeners a taste of something new.</p></div>"|21835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21835-dj-koze-presents-pampa-vol-1/|7.4|Jonah Bromwich

However, her celebrity kicked up a notch once she became Kendrick Lamar's go-to vocalist, lending her ethereal vibes to his projects <i>Good Kid, m.A.A.d. City, To Pimp a Butterfly, </i>and <i>untitled unmastered</i>. If Anna Wise had any perfect moment to step forward to her podium, then that time is certainly now. </p>
<p>She arrives armed with a message that many if not most have trouble effectively communicating. In 2014 a video circulated of a woman walking the streets of New York City amidst a diverse array of male cat calls. The video introduced a dichotomy that manifested itself in every Facebook comment section. Half of the viewers were offended (though many women were also unsurprised) and the other half rolled their eyes. The mixed reaction to that very video is exactly what Wise is speaking to on her EP. The project opens with a snippet of a dissertation on <i>the feminine</i>, and its need to be understood clearly. It pours into the delicate ""Precious Possession,"" which at first listen channels all the romantic vibes of early Erykah Badu, but placed within the context of the project could arguably be completely sardonic. ""I wanna be your princess,"" Wise gently coos. ""Will you call me your girlfriend?"" That's not to say women should exist as stoic figures shrugging at the sight of flowers; she's simply displaying the layers of the feminine psyche, which at times can be self-minimizing in the presence of love.</p>
<p>An interlude ""How Would You Call a Dog?"" reflects on the dual catcalling of both types of ""bitches,"" as Wise snatches the derogations for ""BitchSlut,"" a laundry list of absurd ways women are called both terms. It's empowering, but this topic has been talked into mastication. Still, when Wise cites reasons for being a ""bitchslut,"" including ""Cause your hair's long/ Cause you shaved it off,"" there's a tongue-in-cheek air of brilliance. ""Decrease My Waist, Increase My Wage"" is laid out similarly to a song by a group like the Coup, where the important lyrics are woven so tightly into a basic-sounding song that the stop-and-listen effect solicits an inevitable ""Oh shit.""</p>
<p>Any reference to women on anything is oftentimes an abrasive subject to broach, especially at a time when many are just learning to embrace the word ""feminist."" What Anna Wise attempts with <i>The Feminine: Act I</i> is to serve this realness with a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. While it's still a jagged little pill to swallow—and the proof is in the EP's parts that traipse into cornier territory—Wise does present a degree of transparency that many attempt but wind up losing half their audience in the process. This isn't simply a project to make women nod and smirk; it's a work to hand over to men who assume every aspect of a woman's life is a gift with no curses.</p></div>"|21850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21850-the-feminine-act-i/|6.9|Kathy Iandoli

While museums do brisk business with retrospectives of experimental visual artists—and as hardcore cinephiles flock to see Jean-Luc Godard’s exploration of 3D—you can still find attendees of classical gigs storming out of venues when the music of the mid-20th century is presented. The consistency of this response to the new and recent creates some self-inflicted wounds. Among other problems, the modernist-classical freeze out makes cultural absorption of <i>today’s</i> compositions all the more difficult. (It’s hard to process blazingly new music if you’re still covering your ears in response to Arnold Schoenberg.)</p>
<p>The bleeding-edge virtuosos in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/244-alarm-will-sound/"">Alarm Will Sound</a> have a bit of fun with this state of play on the cover for their latest album, <i>Modernism</i>, with an illustration styled in the manner of a poster for a midcentury sci-fi flick. In addition to pointing out that the history of “modernism” is now long enough to feel every bit as vintage as your favorite piece of B-movie ephemera, the comic portrait of screaming human faces also poses a rhetorical question: <i>Do we honestly still need to act scared by this stuff</i>? Over the course of their 40-minute set, the Alarm Will Sound players and conductor Alan Pierson respond to this prompt by delivering pure modern-classical fun. The six pieces they’ve chosen speak different structural languages, though each one shares a desire to bring across a sense of wildness that is exuberant at heart.</p>
<p>The first composition on the bill is a classical transcription of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>’ “Revolution 9”—the legit <i>musique concrete</i> song on the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13432-the-beatles/"">White Album</a></i> that was famously built from loops and samples of prerecorded sound (including some classical pieces). In interviews, both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">John Lennon</a> were eager to talk up their interest in studio assemblages by European composers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>. And Lennon’s partnership with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"">Yoko Ono</a> was also an influence (given her pathbreaking, early '60s association with experimental composers like <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/09/26/yokokimthurston_and_john_cage_shock_yoko_ono_has_been_making_interesting_music_for_50_years_.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a> and <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/peel-peek-touch-rub-reading-yoko-onos-grapefruit"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Monte Young</a>).</p>
<p>The arrangement on <i>Modernists</i> was devised by the composer and Alarm member Matt Marks, and it’s clear he’s fully sorted out all the sonic layers of the piece. Using nothing but acoustic instruments, the arranger has notated an impressive range of gestures present on the original. And the group’s performance here is stunning—particularly when Alarm’s woodwind and string sections play a few opening licks in a way that successfully calls to mind some of the backward-masking effects of Lennon’s tape loops. Overall, the performance makes a persuasive argument on behalf of “Revolution 9” as a modernist composition, full stop.</p>
<p>From there, <i>Alarm Will Sound</i> present works dedicated to them by a cross-section of contemporary classical heavy hitters. Charles Wuorinen has a fearsome reputation as one of America’s craggiest atonalists, but his “Big Spinoff” has a riff-fueled energy that’s easy to love. Wolfgang Rihm’s “Will Sound” is designed as a test of the group’s collective nimbleness: the length of the phrases for various players seems to be continually expanding and contracting, with each part needing to click into the overall performance just right. (Naturally, the group never sounds tentative when playing this madly morphing music.) <a href=""http://www.augustareadthomas.com/composition/soliloquy.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Augusta Read Thomas</a>’ “Final Soliloquy of the Internal Paramour” superimposes two texts by Wallace Stevens over some active, songful writing for the ensemble. Group pianist John Orfe’s original work “Journeyman” has some rollicking elements that fit in with the overall program, but it’s not quite on the same level as the other recent pieces.</p>
<p>The final composition on the album is another transcription—this time of a piece that’s easier to categorize as belonging to the modernist classical idiom. Yet taking on Edgard Varèse’s “Poème Électronique” is perhaps an even tougher assignment than transcribing “Revolution 9.” The original is plenty musical, but also frequently delicate. On this recording, when Varese’s opening music is assigned to “traditional” instrumentation, there’s a harmonic richness at play that feels at odds with the composer’s more tinny-sounding design. (As the album’s liner notes accurately tell us, Varèse hoped this piece would reach the audience “unadulterated by ‘interpretation.’”) </p>
<p>Though even a performance like this one has its uses—since a question-raising take can help us define exactly how much contingency and revisionism we’re willing to accept from any re-staging of past experimental glories. As with most modern art museum shows, you can quibble with individual curatorial choices. But overall, <i>Modernists</i> makes for a strong show, mounted on behalf of a wing of classical music that isn’t always represented at your local chamber music hall.</p></div>"|21801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21801-modernists/|7.6|Seth Colter Walls

He’d disbanded the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33691-the-revolution/"">Revolution</a>, the band that had backed him since<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21841-purple-rain/"">Purple Rain</a></i>. He’d toyed with doing a collaborative album with Revolution members Wendy &amp; Lisa, but also abandoned that. He’d put a lot of time into crafting a record around an alter ego called Camille, whose tracks were recorded with his voice pitched to sound even more womanly than his trademark falsetto. But that too had stalled.</p>
<p>The album he released on March 31, 1987 was a Prince solo record that, like his 1980 artistic breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21866-dirty-mind/""><i>Dirty Mind</i> </a>and his two earlier albums, was essentially a one-man-band recording which relied heavily on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinnDrum"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LinnDrum</a>, various samplers, and his remarkable aptitude on every instrument under the sun. Of the 16 songs on <i>Sign ""O"" the Times</i>, only three have co-writers, and save for one track (“It’s Going to Be a Beautiful Night”), outside musical accompaniment is slight. In a sense, Prince’s major musical collaborator at this point was his engineer Susan Rogers, who recorded him at different studios in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and even Paris.</p>
<p>But unlike his earlier solo efforts, <i>Sign ""O"" the Times</i> wasn’t a record by an ambitious kid trying to make impression. At 28, Prince had already made himself into a pop superstar  (and movie star too), and he easily sold out arenas. In one sense, he had nothing to prove. Yet <i>Sign ""O"" the Times</i> is the most varied, accomplished record of his prime 1980s period, a testament to the range of his gifts and the bold artistic ambition that gave his music shape.</p>
<p>Part of Prince’s drive was that he was keenly aware that hip-hop was rising up and shifting the sound of music. Rap was entering its “golden age,” and its mix of gritty storytelling and dope beats had to be reckoned with. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a> would release <i>Bad</i>, his own answer to hip-hop, six months later.) So the title cut, with Prince’s commentary on the issues of the day (“a big disease with a little name,” mentions of crack and gang violence) and minimalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3617-run-dmc/"">Run-DMC</a>-styled production, made clear that Prince had his ear to the street. The song functions as Prince’s version of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4o8TeqKhgY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Message</a>,” and, as crazy as that sounds, it works.</p>
<p>Prince wasn’t just wrestling with fresh energy from the streets on <i>Sign ""O"" the Times</i>, but with the twin pillars of carnality and spirituality that had defined his career and that of black popular music for decades. For this Minneapolis native, it wasn’t so much a battle between sin and salvation, as it was how the warring desires could become one, synthesized through innovative arrangements, seductive yet fraught lyrics, and that remarkable voice.</p>
<p>“Forever in My Life,” for example, has the sincere melody of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5239-sly-and-the-family-stone/"">Sly and the Family Stone</a>. It sounds ready made for optimistic sing-a-longs. At first, you think it’s a simple love song, but there’s a devotional quality (“You are my savior/You are my life”) that makes it a chant of piety. At the same time, songs like “Hot Thing” and “It” are aggressively sexual, but in the context of the electronic, oddly-pitched sounds around the words, they seem more like the search for human connection and transcendence rather than a roll in the hay.</p>
<p>The album’s two ballads, “Slow Love” (co-written by singer-songwriter Carol Davis) and “Adore,” are both showcases for Prince’s vocal prowess. The man was an encyclopedia of vocal styles, able to croon like a 1950s pop star on the nostalgic “Slow Love” and do '60s soul style on “Adore.” Though equally adept at showy vocal riffs and screaming in tune, Prince’s lower, cooler register seems to express his truest self.</p>
<p>Prince’s ability to move between genres made him a unique musical chameleon with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"">Paul McCartney</a> his only peers at the highest levels of pop. While he was often compared to Wonder, especially early in his career, it’s the ex-Beatle who seemed to have the most enduring influence. McCartney’s story-song sketches on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13432-the-beatles/"">The White Album</a> helped define his career. For Prince, they were just one of many tools. His whimsical profiles of an odd elementary school classmate (“Starfish &amp; Coffee”) and a quirky lover with the name of a celebrated <i>New Yorker</i> writer (“The Ballad of Dorothy Parker”) are lovely stories supported by surreal sounds and beats, suggesting you are on psychedelic journey through Prince’s memories.</p>
<p><i>Sign ""O"" the Times </i>is difficult to grapple with because there’s so much going on in each track. The up-tempo “Play in the Sunshine” drops in jazz fusion riffs and choral voices just when you think its winding down. “The Cross"" starts as a mournful song of devotion to Christ with acoustic guitar and sitar before exploding into a huge rock anthem with military drums and fuzz guitar. “Play in the Sunshine” opens with the sound of kids at play, becomes a rockabilly song, transitions midway into a guitar showcase, and then, with a marimba, a different drum pattern, and cleverly arranged backing voices, it ends a musical world away from where it began.</p>
<p>“Housequake” is, perhaps, the most obvious songs on the album, a funk jam that would have been a hit single if he’d allowed it to be released as such. But the care of the track’s construction belies any shallow analysis. It starts with a cartoony voice (maybe a Camille reference), a synthesized drum heavy with echo, then adds bass, keyboard stabs, and rhythm guitar. The synth drum and snare drum merge while there’s a double-beat on the kick. Live horns come it and the bass line moves as there’s both a synth bass keyboard and a live bass doing playing different lines. Various backing vocals float in and out with Prince doing his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a> impersonation as singer/MC. Compared to the simple loops of your average club banger, “Housequake” is a symphony of syncopation. The beat moves even as it grooves.</p>
<p>Because Prince played and recorded the album using now-vintage late '80s technology there are moments when certain sounds, particularly the drums, are clearly of their era. But these sonic distractions don’t last as the scope of the songs, the musicianship, and overall arrangements are just too glorious to nitpick. <i>Sign ""O"" the Times</i> is a double album made with a restlessness that never allows it to settle into complacency or formula. It’s a soundtrack to a highly charged and specific period, for both Prince and his listeners. I remember partying to “Housequake” in the summer of '87, laughing along with “Starfish &amp; Coffee,” and playing “Adore” for my girlfriend when it was time to get busy. All these years later, it’s still a vibrant thing, the product of a great artist at the height of his powers.</p></div>"|21845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21845-sign-o-the-times/|10.0|Nelson George

Prince realizes the power of saying “Fuck it, let’s party” in the face of near-assured annihilation, a gesture that foments an effervescent, uncontrollable glee. (Which, here, is depicted by mashed-on keyboards and a joyously wailed policy of ejecting anyone who might be in a less-than-celebratory mood.)</p>
<p>But we all die eventually, right? That’s the attitude that runs through much of <i>1999</i>, which powers itself with machines like the Oberheim OB-SX and the Linn LM–1 while taking a slightly more sober view of the pleasures that dominated so much of Prince’s earlier work. Dangers—the bomb, “brand new laws,” sneering critics—get their airing, and time might be running out (Party over, oops!). Best, then, to get in all the good stuff while one still can, whether those feelings come from extended make-out sessions in the back of a slick car (the simmering “Little Red Corvette,” which emerges from a plume of smoke to become one of Prince’s most potent fusions of funk’s swing and rock’s swagger), late-night secrets about love and lust told among icy synthscapes (the stretched-out seduction “Automatic”), or Prince’s Holy Quadrality of Dance, Music, Sex, and Romance (the jittery “D.M.S.R.”).</p>
<p><i>1999</i> is a sprawling double album (“D.M.S.R.” was cut from initial CD pressings to make it fit on a single disc) on which Prince indulged his curiosity in new technology, but what’s remarkable about it is how tightly-wound it feels, even on the more far-flung jams. “Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)” is claustrophobic and tense, Prince’s pleas to a lover who’s left him behind made even more frantic by the cacophony of digital sounds ricocheting around the mix. (It’s the song that probably brings Prince’s admitted influence of <i>Blade Runner </i>to mind the most.) “Lady Cab Driver” unfolds like a movie playing on fast-forward in Prince’s dirty mind, with a request for a “ride” turning into a bit of slap-and-tickle play before fading back to reality—as evidenced by scritching guitars and the reprise of the song’s feather-light hook.</p>
<p>Then there’s “Delirious,” one of Prince’s most unbridled offerings, its wheezing keyboards sounding like a mind left alone to whirl, propelled by a dizzyingly upbeat drum track and Prince’s half-sneeze vocals. The one-two punch of that track and the Erotic City staycation “Let’s Pretend We’re Married” is enough to drive even the most buttoned-up listener to their own personal brink—one that arrives even before Prince murmurs, “I’m not sayin’ this just 2 be nasty/I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth/Can U relate?” Well. When U put it like that…</p>
<p>It’s not all fun and sex games, of course; even though “1999” makes the idea of impending apocalypse alluring, the planet still goes kablooey when all is said and done. The piano ballad “Free” presents Prince in tender mode, smearing the personal and political together as he sings “Be glad that u r free/Free 2 change your mind.” The music grows increasingly stirring, with militaristic drums and fiercely slapped bass fighting for supremacy as Prince sings of creeping clamp-downs. And “All the Critics Love U in New York” takes the self-regard exhibited by the city and its more pretentious inhabitants and mashes it into a ball. But those forays into the wider world only give the more pleasure-minded tracks on <i>1999 </i>more urgency and lightness.</p>
<p>Prince played with different toys on <i>1999</i>—new synths, new sexual frontiers, new paranoias. He bent them to his will, though, and this 11-song opus was the result. Balancing synth-funk explorations that would reverberate through radio playlists’ ensuing years, taut pop construction, genre-bending, and the proto-nuclear fallout of lust, <i>1999</i> still sounds like a landmark release in 2016; Prince’s singular vision and willingness to indulge his curiosities just enough created an apocalypse-anticipating album that, perhaps paradoxically, was built to last for decades and even centuries to come.</p></div>"|21842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21842-1999/|10.0|Maura Johnston

That seems like the practice of a genius auteur who knows <i>exactly</i> what he wants, which Prince of course was—except for the times when he was a genius auteur who kept changing his mind.</p>
<p>After <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21841-purple-rain/"">Purple Rain</a></i>, Prince spent the rest of the decade trying to repeat its success in theaters (he came closest with <i>Batman</i>, in which he doesn't even appear). <i>Under the Cherry Moon</i>, his second film, is an indulgent stinkeroo: a black-and-white tragicomedy that's not quite a musical. Its soundtrack album, <i>Parade</i>, on the other hand, is breathtaking. Raw, spare, and unflaggingly eccentric, it sounds radically unlike <i>Purple Rain</i>, <i>Around the World</i> and everything else released in 1986, but it's baited with that year's most brilliant #1 single, ""Kiss""—a song that taught its listeners how to hear the rest of the album.</p>
<p>""Kiss"" is a slash in the air surrounded by negative space. Whenever the song is played, it seems to open up a vacuum around it. It's almost unfathomably funky, but it keeps going silent, and its silence yanks the groove forward. Prince famously gave the song to protege group Mazarati as a demo, then snatched it back once he heard the remarkable arrangement that producer David Z had come up with (most of Prince's version is actually Mazarati's recording, including their ""aah-AAA-aah"" backing vocals). Still, it would never have occurred to anyone else to make the recording's groove deeper and the performance more thrilling by mixing out the bass altogether and singing it in a delicate falsetto. (That's why he was Prince and we aren't.) </p>
<p>The rest of <i>Parade</i> makes similarly ingenious use of the zero mark on the mixing desk's faders. Prince asked jazz arranger Clare Fischer to score and record orchestrations for every song on the album except ""Kiss,"" then (mostly) peeled them right back off. Even so, the orchestra is fully present and flickering between dissonance and consonance for the opening track, ""Christopher Tracy's Parade""—although they've still got Prince's mammoth, processed drum sound keeping them in shadow.</p>
<p>Christopher Tracy had been Prince's character in the movie; ""Christopher"" was also the pseudonym he chose to be credit by as writer for the Bangles' ""Manic Monday,"" released a couple of months earlier. But ""Christopher Tracy's Parade"" had formerly been about an actual member of Prince's band: he'd initially recorded it as ""Wendy's Parade,"" a title that survives via a shoutout in the middle of ""Kiss."" It echoes the form and subject of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>' ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,"" but as soon as its horns and flutes fade (and that gigantic beat pauses for a breath, then continues as before), Prince shakes off the psychedelic dreamcoat of <i>Around the World in a Day. </i>When he grabs the mic again and lets loose a whoop and a groan, we're in an even starker groove than ""Kiss"": the brief, insistent ""New Position,"" which is mostly about sex and also kind of about the realignment Prince was demanding of his listeners. There's nothing behind him but the bass-and-drum groove, some steel percussion, and eventually the voices of his invaluable bandmates Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman. (He sings ""I can make u happy"", and they harmonize back at him: ""H.A.P.P.Y.!"" Then he rhymes it with ""I won't be your pappy"", to which they chirp ""P.U.S.S.Y.!"")</p>
<p><i>Parade</i> was a Top Five album. Given how fresh it still sounds, you might imagine that it would have inspired other artists to try what Prince called his ""new funk,"" but you'd be wrong. The direction R&amp;B took in the wake of <i>Parade</i> had a lot more to do with Prince's former associates Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, whose production work for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10541-janet-jackson/"">Janet Jackson</a>, the Human League and Force M.D.'s was pointing toward New Jack Swing. What <i>did</i> endure beyond <i>Parade</i> was Prince's new habit of perpetually tinkering with his albums after they seemed to be finished. The album as initially sequenced would have been very different and significantly less fun: all four songs that were released as singles were added later on. As it is, there are still a few throwaways on it, like the formless instrumental ""Venus De Milo"" and the interstitial doodle ""I Wonder U,"" as well as incongruous if charming moments like ""Do U Lie?,"" a ridiculous stroll through bistro jazz that lets Prince try on a few silly accents for flirtation's sake.</p>
<p>Still, the slow, elegiac ""Sometimes It Snows in April"" stayed in Prince's live repertoire right up to his final show. And the core of the album is its dance tracks, bracingly crisp and airy, with those offhanded register-vaulting vocals and that peculiar rhythmic lurch no other artist could duplicate. With ""Kiss"" as its key and signpost, <i>Parade</i> makes the case that the secret engine of Prince's funk was what it left out.</p></div>"|21844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21844-parade/|9.1|Douglas Wolk

It would’ve made Oscar Wilde stammer, and Humphrey Bogart re-consider his right to have a name that starts with “Hump.”</p>
<p>If you’ve never seen the seven-minutes of Marquis de Sade-soul that comprises Prince’s “Gett Off” performance, <a href=""http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/princes-1991-mtv-video-awards-performance-is-the-maybe-1772314076"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">watch it right now</a>. I’ll still be here when if you return. It’s the lead single from his 13th studio album, <i>Diamonds and Pearls</i>, and the only proper context for Prince’s state of grind.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the conversation between Prince and the awards show producers?</p>
<p><i>“Okay, I’m going a need a flaming stage that looks like the ruin of an ancient Roman brothel exclusively occupied by senators and their horses. 30 erotic back-up dancers in thongs, sheer negligees, and leotards, and no, I can’t share with C&amp;C Music Factory. </i></p>
<p><i>Think the Minneapolis sound meets New Jack Swing meets a Caligulan orgy. I’ll be wearing a ventilated yellow jumpsuit with a plunging neckline and matching guitar. My collar will be silk. My pants will be assless. Tell Amy Grant to leave the room when I come on.”</i></p>
<p>A quarter-century later, it’s still unbelievable that it happened on cable television in a country with George H.W. Bush as President. These are the things you can’t explain, but can only witness. For every Prince performance, there’s someone who will claim that it was his best, but I’m reasonably certain that the '91 VMAs are superior to all—even that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFXZNt4oLkE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coachella performance</a> that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a> look like poseurs. There’s a brief moment of human fallibility as he takes the stage, a split-second fumble of the microphone, then he offers communion via mass orgasm.</p>
<p>Time and place shade the perspective. This wasn’t the first time I ever encountered that Purple: there was the “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRP7rwvy6k4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Batdance</a>” video, where he dressed in full Joker regalia, turned the <i>Batman </i>theme into acid-faced funk, and rivaled Ray Parker Jr. for best song ever written for an '80s film. But Ray Parker Jr. never seduced Vicki Vale, nor recorded them fucking in the studio for a song called “Scandalous Sex Suite.”</p>
<p>The '91 VMAs was the first time I witnessed the real Prince, the original Mr. Steal Your Girl, the one who wrote his first song at age 7 and called it “Funk Machine.” For a 9-year old, it was baffling and awesome—like walking into the second act of a movie, frantically trying to piece together a plot line, but developmentally unprepared to do so. Who was this man? How could he do the splits so easily? How did his vocals effortlessly levitate from sordid lothario to brilliant eunuch? What did 23 positions in a one-night stand mean? (I’m willing to give Prince full credit as a sexual wunderkind, but let’s be real: some of those positions had to be minor variations. Sort of like how he claimed to play 27 instruments but included nine types of keyboards and organs—yet somehow no “woodwinds.”)</p>
<p>Prince’s eccentric genius ensured that he’d never fit into a particular genre or corner of pop music. But it seemed particularly incongruous in September 1991, a world where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a> and MC Hammer presented the VMA Viewer’s Choice Award to Queensryche. Less than one week later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> released “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” triggering grunge and teaching a generation how to seem affected and disaffected at the same time. Two weeks later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6195-a-tribe-called-quest/"">A Tribe Called Quest</a> dropped<i> Low End Theory</i>.  The VMAs heralded the last dry heave of the '80s, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2120-chris-isaak/"">Chris Isaak</a> triumphed over Jon Bon Jovi, George Michael, and Gerardo for “Best Male Video.”</p>
<p><i>Diamonds and Pearls</i> came on the satin heels of a three-year run where critics gleefully scrawled Prince’s eulogy. A bad ecstasy trip allegedly led him to shelve <i>The Black Album</i> in favor of the uneven <i>Lovesexy</i>. The <i>Batman </i>soundtrack reached No. 1, but felt campy and far removed from his late-’80s apex<i>, Sign “O” the Times</i>. While the sequel to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21841-purple-rain/"">Purple Rain</a>,</i> 1990’s <i>Graffiti Bridge </i>completely bombed, receiving five Golden Raspberry Nominations and yielding a soundtrack that failed to go platinum.</p>
<p>The solution was assless pants and obscene funk. The latter arrived via the New Power Generation, the first band Prince used since dissolving the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33691-the-revolution/"">Revolution</a> a half-decade earlier. Until <i>Diamonds and Pearls</i>, Paisley Park’s director had a notoriously contentious relationship with hip-hop. He welcomed sampling but scorned “tone deaf” rappers who talked “silly shit.” Big Daddy Kane contributed a “Batdance” remix, but it never saw official release. Not even Prince could ignore that rap had dethroned R&amp;B and funk as the most vital urban sound.</p>
<p>In response, Prince converted a former backup dancer named Anthony Mosley into the lead rapper of the New Power Generation. That’s Tony M on “Gett Off,” wearing the rattail and purple racing jacket, doing his best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7233-chuck-d/"">Chuck D</a> boom but bringing noise more like the guy who rapped on Snap!’s “The Power.”</p>
<p>Prince famously called Tony M. “the wittiest pen the Twin Cities had ever seen,” but there are currently fourth-string rappers on the Rhymesayers bench with more bars. His “Jughead” attempted to start a new dance craze, but includes the dated slang you’d expect from a Christopher Guest parody biopic of Father MC: (“Get stupid,” “Mack Daddy in the House,” ""turn the mutha out,” “clocking a freak in a low pro.”)</p>
<p>As for Tony, he admitted in a 1991 <i>Details </i>profile that the people back in North Minneapolis no longer liked Prince because they saw him as a pop thing. But he quickly added, “They didn’t like Van Gogh, did they?” Then again, Prince didn’t need to cut off an ear and give it to Apollonia. His popular decline mirrored the natural gravity of the music business. Until Prince, almost no solo artist had spent a decade at the top of the charts.</p>
<p>It’s not quite accurate to call <i>Diamonds and Pearls</i> a comeback. If anything, it inaugurated the brief New Power Generation phase of his career, the last in which he was a commercial force. For the first time, Prince found himself chasing trends rather than setting them. On “Daddy Pop,” he urges people to stop “living in the past” when they should be “living the new,” over Teddy Riley drums and wheeling sacral organs.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of old-world spirituals and contemporary bounce might as well have doubled as a mission statement. Prince reveled in contradiction: demonizing illegal downloading and YouTube while simultaneously being one of the first to leverage the internet to sell directly to fans. He chastised rappers who didn’t say anything, but partially ceded the spotlight to a man who attempted to turn an <i>Archie</i> character into a dance craze. <i>Diamonds and Pearls</i> reflects the minor crises of a man in his early 30s, too agile to be outmoded, but no longer able to depend on the effortless violations of youth. He could still do the splits, but he wasn’t sure for how much longer.</p>
<p>“Thunder” stitches evangelic lyrics to sub-continental sitars, slashing guitars, and chord progressions that Max Martin has swiped for the last two decades. It’s basically a proto-Backstreet Boys anthem for born-agains. There are the classic Prince deep cuts usually only cited by the apostles (“Willing and Able”) and sunny day guitar benedictions to individualism (“Walk Don’t Walk”). “Strollin” pairs George Benson jazz guitars to New Edition adolescent pop, and a story about two teens roller skating, eating ice cream, and buying porn. It’s weird. It’s Prince.</p>
<p>If you’ve heard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"">OutKast</a>’s “2 Dope Boyz (In a Cadillac),” you’ll recognize the extraterrestrial intro of “Live 4 Love (Last Words From the Cockpit”—an anti-gang space-rap exploration about what happened after he got kicked out of his house at 17. Even the afterthoughts betray a brilliant guitar riff, organ lick, or drum coda.</p>
<p>But it’s pointless to pretend that we remember this album for much more than its four Top 40 hits. “Gett Off” led to more unplanned pregnancies than anything Prince had recorded since “Kiss.” His final #1 hit, “Cream” triangulated<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/""> T. Rex</a> and Robert Palmer into something that rivals only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"">Wu-Tang</a> for the greatest song named after a dairy product. The late night neon jazz grooves of “Money Don’t Matter 2 Night” remind me of Steely Dan if they played it straight. It’s an indictment of greed, self-destruction, and the war machine—ending with the stark image of a child shrouded in a cloud of poison gas.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the title song—the twinkling locket-pop ballad that both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/"">Cam’ron</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a> eventually rapped over. One of those songs they’ll play at weddings until we stop using diamond engagement rings and the ocean runs out of pearls. It’s Prince at his best, blending dizzying romance with an undercurrent of danger. He opens up: “This will be the day/That you will hear me say/That I will never run away.” It’s a utopian promise he knows he can’t keep, an incantation he hopes will become true if he utters it out loud. “Love must be the master plan,” he says, echoing a clichéd sentiment that so many before him have uttered. But Prince had the gift of making you believe whatever he said.</p>
<p>As with all the greatest pop stars, Prince was a master at simplifying life’s most complicated emotions into catchphrases. He encompassed lust, jealousy, fear, spirituality, avarice, the impulse to run away, and the need to strip everything to its core—sometimes literally, sometimes figuratively.  The man who believed in everlasting love died alone and childless, adored by almost the entire world. A song like “Diamonds and Pearls” illustrates why. For all the flamboyance and idiosyncrasy, Prince just wanted the same things as everyone else.</p></div>"|21846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21846-diamonds-and-pearls/|8.3|Jeff Weiss

You were to believe that he was as mysterious as god, something conjured, perhaps from your fantasies, a magical apparition descending from funk heaven, arriving on a cloud of purple smoke and adorned in little more than a guitar, a falsetto made of glitter, and a deeply intractable groove.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But as the wildly creative are wont to do, by 1983 Prince was looking to switch that whole thing up. Despite his acute talent, he was still viewed by the industry at large as little more than an extra-funky urban novelty act, someone in league with the likes of </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTZwhO-ggcw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rick James</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AckzNG01Zkw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lipps Inc</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. His most successful song to date, “Little Red Corvette,” had peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, which simply was not good enough for the man who once described the musical training he received at the hands of his father as “almost like the Army.”  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In 1982, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Bruce Springsteen</a> was devastating the country with the spare and stark depictions of a bankrupt American Dream on his darkened opus <i>Nebraska</i>. Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet band were doubling down on white-man soul with the basic but wildly popular “Old Time Rock &amp; Roll,” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a> was re-wiring the industry with an album composed almost entirely of number 1 pop hits that spent 37 weeks lording over the Billboard charts. Prince’s keyboardist, Dr. Fink, </span><a href=""http://www.spin.com/2016/04/prince-the-oral-history-of-purple-rain-brian-raftery/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">recalls</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that during the </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1999</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> tour, his band leader asked him what makes Seger’s music so popular. “Well, he's playing mainstream pop-rock,” Fink told him. “If you were to write something along these lines, it would cross things over for you even further."" Prince had already been carrying a purple notebook with him on the tour bus in which he had been scribbling the ideas, notes and images that would become his next movement. (Prince didn’t make albums, he made environments) and he was looking for something new. </span></p>
<p>That “something new” was <i>Purple Rain</i>, a sonic and visual experience that cracks open the shell of his reclusive sex alien persona to tell something of an origin story, one slightly more than loosely based on Prince’s real life. The film, directed by an unknown, produced by first timers and starring a bunch of people who had never acted in a movie before, has become an astronomical and enduring success against overwhelming odds. But it does so because it’s a film about America, about revolution and youth and anger and fucking. About not being like your dad. That is to say, it’s about rock'n'roll. It’s the tale of a kid from an abusive home in a cold, working-class city who has a shitload of talent and a dream. And he has to figure out, through tortuous trial and error, exactly what he needs to destroy in order to achieve it. <i>Purple Rain</i> is rough and vulnerable, common and funny, and at times even cute. It is the exact opposite of everything Prince had been before it.  But let’s not kid ourselves. The movie is merely decently shot, competently directed, and not even passably acted. The real reason it works is because of the itinerant magnetism of its lead and of the music he can make.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Prince’s sixth studio offering, 1984's <i>Music From The Motion Picture Purple Rain</i>, is Springsteen’s <i>Nebraska</i> laced with the violence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a>’s deepest grooves and liberally dusted with white dove feathers, dried rose petals, and scented candle wax. The album manages to deftly thread the needle between a dazzling array of genres: disaffected synth pop, tongue-wagging hair metal, dark R&amp;B, and pleading soul. The result is something that isn’t a successful combination of genres as much as an effortless, almost incidental transcendence of the very idea of genre itself. It doesn’t matter what it’s called. It doesn’t matter what you like. You like this. It is wrong to say that <i>Purple Rain</i> blazes a new trail. Rather it beams a blinding light signal from a part of the forest that no one will be able to ever find again. You cannot make another album like it. The only way to get to where <i>Purple Rain</i> takes you is to play <i>Purple Rain</i>.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Given that the album is somewhat of an early-career look back for Prince, it gives us new access into his musical and cultural background. His hometown of Minneapolis boasted a black population of 4.3% in the 1970 census and, other than the low range KMOJ, didn’t have an urban formatted station until 2000. If you grew up listening to the radio in the Minneapolis of Prince’s youth, then you grew up listening to rock. Thusly the album’s opening salvo, ""</span>Let’s Go Crazy<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,"" thematically picks up where the titular track from <i>1999</i> leaves off, namely: “We’re all going to die one way or another, so let’s rock while we’re here,” but musically is a dramatic departure from the slick, smokey grooves of its predecessor. It is set against a hyperactive American backbeat reminiscent of latter-day rockabilly, and features Prince ripping out the kind of ostentatiously speedy Van Halen-esque guitar work that would become the audio version of the generation’s early MTV aesthetic. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From there, the album drops into the closest thing it has to a dud in the Apollonia duet ""</span>Take Me With U.""<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> But like another genius pop composer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, (to whom Prince is not compared nearly enough), his work brims with so many compelling musical ideas that they can be found hidden in even the weakest of tracks. “Take Me With U” is distinguished by a stellar intro and bridge played only on tom-tom and strings. On ""The Beautiful Ones,"" </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Prince the serpentine is at his most coiled, his falsetto vocals syrupy and tightly wound until they explode into a wounded animal scream. “</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do you want him/Or do you want me/Cuz I want you!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">” he howls, bursting out of the song all together. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the movie’s plot, this is about a love triangle, but it feels more like Prince is at the throat of his listeners. “Do you want that bullshit on the radio? Or do you want this brilliance? Make up your goddamn mind!”</span></p>
<p>""Computer Blue"" <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">begins with a cryptic spoken exchange between guitarist Wendy Melvoin and Keyboardist Lisa Coleman that may either be about an impending sex act or an impending cup of tea, (vaguely pornographic ambiguity is an aesthetic calling card of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33691-the-revolution/"">The Revolution</a>, Prince’s adroit, androgynous, and multi-racial backing band). The ensuing song is a club jam about the common '80s theme of existential technological alienation. It flows smoothly into a melodic instrumental, the unlisted ""</span>Father's Song"" <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">that showcases Prince’s talent for crafting a surprisingly emotional narrative out of a chord progression and a guitar solo (foreshadowing, perhaps?) before devolving into feedback, wordless screaming, and the intro to the crowning achievement of the first half. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That achievement is ""</span>Darling Nikki<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,"" a track that is both thick and skimpy, dark and taut: a thumping, loping, grinding fuck song about getting dirty with and getting played by the timeless femme fatale. The denouement, a quivering undulating coda, impossibly finds the musical link between burlesque backing bands and thrash metal double bass pedal rumbles, and is topped off by a terse and violent guitar solo. The whole song seems to operate at three different tempos simultaneously, leaving no part of your body or spirit quite able to escape its savage grasp. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second half of the album begins with the confessional ""</span>When Doves Cry,"" <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the album’s first single (and Prince’s first ever Billboard #1) wherein he delivers his most pointedly personal lyrics yet, “</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Maybe I’m just like my father/Too bold/Maybe you're just like my mother/She’s never satisfied.</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">” In the hands of a lesser talent this could come off as maudlin public journal reading, but fortunately for all of us, “When Doves Cry” is one of Prince’s most affecting compositions to date, launching with a bristling guitar burst before dropping into a karst</span><a href=""https://youtu.be/xF3aR_dcy0M?t=73"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">LM-1</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> drum pattern featuring the signature knocks he used to great effect on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1999</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> . The ensuing groove provides a solid bed for a bouquet of rococo keyboard arpeggios and steadily unfolding melodic progressions that expertly capture the helpless confessional pleading of a man trying to figure out who he is and why it hurts so damn much. It is the the mid-show stopper, Prince as Rimbaud in pressed petals and lace, carefully gluing together a ransom note from a prison of his own beauty and emotion.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having covered the tough stuff, we are free to party, and ""</span>I Would Die 4 U"" <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is a celebratory, if lyrically morose, jam distinguished by a vast swaths of new wave synth, deep bounce and an insistent high hat. Following that is the impish and yet entirely earnest ""</span>Baby I’m A Star."" <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is not Prince the character saying it, it is Prince the 26 year old serving notice that he’s greater than we could have ever imagined (turned out he was right) and that we need either get on board or get left. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Which brings us to the album’s title track, the epic and uncharacteristic arena jam “</span>Purple Rain.<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">” Prince here is part preacher, part guitar god. So deeply embedded in arena rock is this song that Prince </span><a href=""http://ultimateclassicrock.com/prince-purple-rain-journey-faithfully/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">reportedly</span></a> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">called Jonathan Cain and Neal Schon of Journey to ask their blessing (and to ensure they wouldn’t sue over the song’s proximity to “</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMD8hBsA-RI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Faithfully</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">”). ""Purple Rain"" is a baptism, a washing clean of sins and a chance at redemption, even if the words don’t make any sense, (and to most people they don’t) the vastness of the arrangement, the grandiosity of the soloing, the pleading of the vocals reaches you, makes you cry, makes you feel free. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With <i>Purple Rain</i>, Prince bursts forth from the ghetto created by mainstream radio and launches himself directly onto the Mt. Rushmore of American music. He plays rock better than rock musicians, composes better than jazz guys, and performs better than everyone, all without ever abandoning his roots as a funk man, a party leader, a true MC.  The album and film brought him a fame greater and more frightening than even he imagined and he would eventually retreat into the reclusive and obtuse inscrutability for which he ultimately became known. But for the 24 weeks <i>Purple Rain</i> spent atop the charts in 1984, the black kid from the midwest had managed to become the most accurate expression we had of young America’s overabundance of angst, love, horniness, recklessness, idealism, and hope. For those 24 weeks at least, Prince was one of us.</span></p></div>"|21841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21841-purple-rain/|10.0|Carvell Wallace

After disco brought forth the most racially integrated moment popular music had seen since Kennedy was shot, the ensuing backlash was fierce, and radio finally got fed up with the club scene telling it what to play. So once the airwaves declared dance music dead at the very tail end of the ’70s, African-American stars who didn’t have hits that predated disco—which was just about all of them, besides <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33195-diana-ross/"">Diana Ross</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2323-kool-the-gang/"">Kool &amp; the Gang</a>—had to either drastically change their game, face instant obsolesce, or only play to black audiences.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> wasn’t about to take option two or three. When he signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 , he told A&amp;R head Lenny Waronker: “Don’t make me black.” Then the multi-instrumentalist proved his hard rock bona-fides on the guitar-shredding “I’m Yours,” from his 1978 debut <i>For You</i>, and “Bambi,” from 1979’s <i>Prince</i>,<i> </i>just as surely as he served notice of his disco cred with that self-titled album’s “I Wanna Be Your Lover,” a major pop and chart-topping R&amp;B hit. But still, his vibe on those early wailing solos wasn’t any hipper than that of any other geek who spent his lonely teen years mastering byzantine jazz-fusion wankery.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Prince’s <i>Dirty Mind</i>, his first fully actualized album, changed all that in 1980—though it isn’t the thorough break from his brief past that it’s generally made out to be. It starts with the most blatant disco throb in his entire discography on the title cut, and his second-heaviest thump pounds through “Uptown,” which opens Side B. At 30 ultra-tight minutes, a length that allowed for more walloping vinyl, Prince’s sole slow-jam-deficient album is pretty much an unrelenting dance party that pointedly invited New Wavers to boogie down alongside funk bunnies and dancefloor fashionistas. It’s one of the key records that truly initiated the ’80s.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s all there in what’s not. Whereas Prince’s ’70s albums proclaimed his virtuosity, here he achieves much more by confining himself to the simplest, boldest strokes. Like Krautrock’s motorik beat, Prince’s opening “Dirty Mind” rhythms are just about as close a human can get to a metronome; no tom-tom fills, no accents on the high-hat, just an occasional syncopation on cheaply recorded cymbals that suggest a drum machine’s hiss. Like Chic or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/690-the-cars/"">the Cars</a>, Prince makes the album’s inaugural guitar so staccato it’s nearly a percussion instrument, and much of the arrangement’s tension and release is located in just how much he lets its nearly solitary chord ring out. Halfway through, “Dirty Mind” breaks down in quintessential disco fashion, but right after it builds back up, four descending key changes are offset by ascending, churchy organ: a particularly Prince-like juxtaposition that offers a peek-a-boo glimpse into the convolutions—sexual and otherwise—of his psyche. The composition denies consummation in favor of suspended anticipation.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Because so much of <i>Dirty Mind</i>’s instrumentation is expressed in prickly masculine terms, Prince’s vocals feel that much more free and startlingly girly. His generation grew up with falsetto soul men—Motown’s Smokey Robinson and Eddie Kendricks in the ’60s, Philly’s Stylistics and other harmony acts of the ’70s—and it can be argued that they scored with white audiences because their higher, more ecstatically female frequencies made their race and sexuality less threatening. But it can’t be underestimated how much Prince quite threateningly set off gaydar—particularly with this positively giddy album. Later on, he’d become a superstar singing in his regular range on most hits from <i>1999</i> and <i>Purple Rain</i>, but here he establishes his confrontational persona by ramping up the sighs and squeals. Although Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman—</span><span class=""s2"">LGBT members of Prince’s peak-era band the Revolution—</span><span class=""s1"">pretty much nailed it when they deemed Prince a “fancy lesbian,” folks of every persuasion still argue about his sexual identity to this day. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That ambiguity is played to the hilt on the track that cemented Prince’s New Wave connection, “When You Were Mine.” The music evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"">Elvis Costello</a>’s bitter rigidity, but the lyric wanders way beyond that songwriter’s cuckold comfort zone: There’s the sharing of the clothes and the voyeuristic, nearly-bi way his post-breakup attention shifts from the gender-indeterminate object of his affection to his ex <i>and</i> her/his current steady guy. And, of course, the zinger: “I never was the kind to make a fuss/When he was there, sleeping in-between the two of us.” Whether it was sung by Prince or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6272-cyndi-lauper/"">Cyndi Lauper</a>, who <a href=""https://youtu.be/Q53oZpyxZ-8?list=PLVwgmSHNOMAyN3FRMWKPgAH_ptZui5SqQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">memorably covered</a> the song without changing its nouns on 1983’s <i>She’s So Unusual</i>, that line caught everyone’s attention. Only a new kind of person could do it justice.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Dirty Mind</i>’s second side is unquestionably Prince’s most propulsive suite. It begins with “Uptown,” which ranks alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33526-vanity/"">Vanity</a> 6’s Prince-penned-and-produced “Nasty Girl” among the most daring R&amp;B radio hits of the ’80s. But its topic is even more singular—how homophobia constricts even heterosexuals. The song celebrates a boho utopia where fag-bashing, racism, misogyny, and all other trifling shit doesn’t exist: While minding his own business, a passing hottie asks him point blank, “Are you gay?” But instead of blowing his cool, Prince reasons, “She’s just a victim of society and all its games.” To school the dame, he takes her to Uptown, a real-life Minneapolis counterculture haven back in 1980 that’s subsequently been gentrified. There, she loses her uptight ways as the track’s grinding disco-funk gains momentum; the overwhelming freedom acts as an aphrodisiac, and the once-scorned weirdo gets “the best night I ever had.” Everybody’s happy.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The tempo downshifts slightly but significantly on “Head,” one of the earliest fully realized manifestations of Prince’s quintessential style. The song features another scenario perfectly archetypal of The Purple One: He meets a virgin (played with drawling deadpan glee by Coleman) on the way to her wedding, and she gives him what the song celebrates.  This results in a Bill Clinton maneuver on her gown, so she dumps her plans and marries him instead. As suggested by his thorniest, most authoritative early groove, this isn’t necessarily a wise choice; Prince vows, with not a small amount of matrimonial menace, to “love you till you’re dead.”</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Right before the onslaught of AIDS, “Head” was mighty strong stuff, but even it couldn’t compare to the next track: a 93-second punkabilly ditty that abruptly cuts off right as its bridge peaks, as if caught <i>in flagrante</i>. “Sister” celebrates incest like the rest of the record toys with sexual identity; it’s blatantly performative, yet Prince invests so much into it that it’s impossible to definitively conclude whether he fucked his sister or is merely fucking with <i>us</i>. The music matches this instability; his trebly guitar chords may be fast and furious like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">Ramones</a>, but the time signature keeps flipping to trip up ears and feet.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The final kiss-off, “Partyup,” denounces President Carter’s 1980 reinstatement of draft registration. Prince’s fury is both straightforward (“How you gonna make me kill somebody I don’t even know?)” and efficiently metaphorical (“Because of their half-baked mistakes/We get ice cream, no cake”). Meanwhile, the track—in-the-pocket on the bottom but liberatingly loose on top—finds the pleasure in getting thoroughly pissed off, especially during its ’60s-worthy closing chant: “You’re gonna hafta fight your own damn war/ ’Cause we don’t wanna fight no more.”</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">“Partyup” earns its “revolutionary rock‘n’roll” self-proclamation even though it, like most everything else on the album, is pretty much uncut funk with louder guitars and tunes so catchy you can’t deny the pop. Yet the attitude on this homemade landmark album, which was originally intended as a demo, couldn’t be purer punk: <i>Dirty Mind</i> rejects labels, restrictions, and authority. That’s why, despite its many colors, the music comes across so gloriously black; why Prince’s aura is so righteously flaming; why the singing wraps its pervy purple raincoat around what’s feminine. Prince was the kind of guy who couldn’t be boxed in by anything, so <i>Dirty Mind</i> has him rebelling against even his relatively ordinary and modest early success.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That may have lost him a few fans. The album never went platinum in the U.S. like its predecessor or 11 of the albums that followed, and even “Uptown” narrowly missed the Hot 100. But his willful aberrance also earned him a new kind of audience, one that would also support <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"">the Clash</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2207-grace-jones/"">Grace Jones</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19924-culture-club/"">Culture Club</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33181-rick-james/"">Rick James</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24089-frankie-knuckles/"">Frankie Knuckles</a>, and all the other super freaks of ’80s rock, soul, pop, and dance music. Disco’s so-called death resurrected and radicalized Prince’s already restless definition of self. Here, he becomes everything.</span></p></div>"|21866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21866-dirty-mind/|10.0|Barry Walters

<p>Invited by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">Rolling Stones</a> to open for them on their <i>Tattoo You</i> American tour, Prince and his band came face-to-face with the kind of hate that he would dedicate his entire career to thoroughly and soundly vanquishing. “We went on when the sun was still up, I think we hit the stage around six or seven at night,” recalled bandmate Matt Fink in Touré’s book <i>I Will Die 4 U</i>. “We get on stage and within two minutes of the first song the audience, which was a hardcore hippie crowd, they took one look at Prince and went what the heck is this? And they started booing, flipping us the bird. […] And they’re throwing whatever they could get their hands on…a crumpled up Coca-Cola can. I saw a fifth of Jack Daniels whiz by Prince’s face….”</p>
<p>The scene brought back chilling memories of another turbulent, racially-charged moment in pop music culture from just two years before, when Chicago shock-jock Steve Dahl corralled tens of thousands of his listeners to pack Comiskey Park and channel their anti-queer, anti-people of color, anti-woman rage into Disco Demolition night during a White Sox evening doubleheader. The L.A. Coliseum crowd wasn’t having it and neither was Prince, who famously stormed off the stage and hopped a jet back to Minnesota, leaving his band to finish “Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad” without him. Although Mick Jagger would coax him to return two days later, the ensuing shows were more of the same, and Prince and band dropped off of the tour before his new album hit stores.</p>
<p>Back in those days, he knew what he was up against. Prince knew that the sound and look of what he’d been crafting in the club scene back in Minnesota and further on record across three increasingly daring albums that fused slinky R&amp;B with greasy funk rhythms, glam guitar, Afro new-wave synth, post-punk energy, and thrillingly androgynous vocals were reasons to sound the alarm that another kind of Sly riot was goin’ on. “I’m sure wearing underwear and a trench coat didn’t help matters…” he mused to Robert Hilburn in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, “but if you throw trash at anybody, it’s because you weren’t trained right at home.”</p>
<p>Released on October 14, 1981, <i>Controversy</i> became a conveniently radical rejoinder to that incident, one of the most famous moments in early Prince history. If the L.A. Coliseum crowd’s violent repulsion of him brought to the surface the racism, sexism (because, don’t forget, longtime keyboardist Lisa Coleman was touring with him at that point, too), and homophobia coursing through rock culture, <i>Controversy</i> was another one of Prince’s defiant declarations that his revolution was not deterred, that it was still fully under way and on its way in spite of racist rock culture’s resistance to it.</p>
<p><i>Controversy</i> is often thought of as the bridge between Prince’s pathbreaking <i>Dirty Mind</i> and the epic, new-world-making <i>1999</i>. But it was released during one of the most consequential social, political, and cultural years of the U.S. 1980s for people living in the margins of America—people of color, women, queer folk, poor folk. And the fact that Prince, louder than most all of his peers, was continuing to call, on this record, for collective social and cultural revolt through and by way of his music makes it one of the most important album releases of 1981.</p>
<p>No one was combining the carnal with collective social resistance and political critique as overtly and as imaginatively and along the axes of race, gender, and sexuality as Prince all throughout his three-decade plus career, and especially on this record. As he had on his previous releases, he assumed the role of the pan-musician on <i>Controversy</i>, having a hand on nearly every instrument but also calling on Coleman for backing vocals (on the album’s title track, and “Ronnie, Talk to Russia” and “Jack U Off”). Fellow future members of his band the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33691-the-revolution/"">Revolution</a>, Dr. Fink and Bobby Z. would supply keyboards (as did Coleman) and drums, respectively on the closing track, “Jack U Off.”</p>
<p>A seven-minute dance epic unto itself, “Controversy” is comprised of many moving parts: oft-cited anti-confessional lyrics (“Am I black or white/ Am I straight or gay…”), vocals that swing between the spoken and the sung, an oscillation between concern for the “I,” the “you,” and the “we,” the Princely melding of the high spiritual (including a recitation of The Lord’s Prayer) and the suggestion of the profane (“I wish we all were nude…”), the dream of no boundaries (“I wish there were no black and white/ I wish there were no rules…”). It’s a song about a longing to be emancipated from our most wretched and oppressive inhibitions and biases, and as Prince climbs a register and takes us to the gripping bridge (“Some people want to die/ So they can be free”), we hear the suggestion of other places where we might go with him.</p>
<p>“Sexuality” represents the Utopia Prince has always pursued, a place that was for him often one and the same with heaven. “Let your body be free,” he implores on this throbbing manifesto, willing his listeners towards the queer future elsewhere. Prince makes liberal use of that signature vocal squeal—filthier and more sexually intimate than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a>’s scream, filled with lust, mischief, orgasmic delight, gasps and exhalations. It is the sound of revelry in the body that gives way to a call to “stand up everybody” while he talks of “revolution” and a “new age revelation” that we “don’t need no race.” All we need is each other on the dancefloor and in the act of profoundly erotic coupling.</p>
<p>On the surface, Prince’s insistence on sexuality as the key to liberation seems about a decade late: post-free-love era, after the official timelines for the feminist and LGBT revolutions and the golden years of funk and disco. As much as critics were swooning over the fearless edge and hybrid genre and gender-bending he’d exhibited with abandon on <i>Dirty Mind</i>, most people considered the content of Prince’s message out of time and place, the cries of an oddball brother from the cold Midwest. But the intensity and urgency of this music put it in the here-and-now. Protest songs had gone out of fashion in the early '80s. In the moment right before the era of Band Aid, Amnesty International, and U.S.A. for Africa, pop protest was largely absent from the airwaves, and even if it had been in fashion, no one other than Prince would have been yoking together lyrics about the body with calls to have children avoid television ""until they know how to read"" (rather than just how to “cuss, fight and breed”).</p>
<p>What did it mean for Prince to seemingly be yelling into the wilderness about getting in formation? Who, in God’s name, was Prince addressing earlier that year when, during his <a href=""http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/prince-party-up/3023831"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Saturday Night Live"" debut</a>, he closed out “Partyup” with that song’s blazing refrain, “You’re gonna have to fight your own damn war/ ‘cause we don’t want to fight no more!” before angrily leaping off the stage, storming into the audience and out of camera range? </p>
<p>Particularly in hindsight, there was much worth fighting against in 1981, especially if you were an African-American avant-garde, countercultural pop musician. It was the year Ronald Reagan took office, thus igniting a new repressive regime of economic, social, and cultural policies that would further oppress poor and working class communities and communities of color. It was the year of what was, at the time, thought to be the earliest reported cases of the AIDS virus. It was the year that African American loner Wayne Williams was brought into custody as a suspect in the Atlanta child murder cases, and it was the year of what is sometimes referred to as the last recorded lynching of an African-American by members of the KKK.</p>
<p><i>Controversy</i>’s two opening tracks open fighting and dancing, demanding that we dance ourselves out of clothes, out of our constrictions as a way to fight the corrosive powers that be. It is the sound of a battle under way, and the doe-eyed beauty on its cover, the one in the diamond-studded purple jacket with white shirt and bolero tie, the one with the “Rude Boy” button that signaled his solidarity with black diasporic ska and punk insurgencies, the one  with his back against a wall strewn with Prince daily news headlines, is here on this record ready to play “Dr. Everything Will Be Alright” as well as apocalyptic prophet. The former persona rules over Side One, where we find him fighting the tyranny of alienation (life looked at “through a pocket camera,” as he sees it on track two) with the joy of copulation on the fight-the-power-through-funking track “Sexuality.”</p>
<p>Having remade the universe in his own image, the first side closes in the bedroom with one of Prince’s great sex ballads (of which there are dozens). On “Do Me, Baby,” Prince transitions genres yet again, moving into full soul falsetto to stage a scene of carnal supplication, a slow jam dripping with angst and wanting and sensual desperation. It’s a come-on song that’s all about the desire to be taken, a love song delivered by an impish sprite of a man who’s prone to wearing bikini briefs and constantly on the make. “Do Me, Baby” ends not with two-person consummation but with a staged scenario (characteristic of long form R&amp;B and funk narratives) in which our hero takes matters into his own hands to reach ecstasy while his lover sits and watches. “I’m not gonna stop,” he declares, “until the war is over.”</p>
<p>The second half of <i>Controversy</i> is less cohesive as a narrative about sexual insurgency as protest and social reform, but it nonetheless repeatedly returns to these themes across four tracks that swing between hope and despair, the ecstatic and the horrific, the traumatic and the bawdy. If, on the first side, Prince asks us (almost incredulously), “Don’t you wanna play?,” on Side Two, he pushes the art of sexual play to Holy Revival heights on “Private Joy,” a song that marries soul-meets-rockabilly vocals with a Sunday morning, get happy, arrangement that spins us into the center of the church sanctuary and right out the door into the pagan after-hours club.</p>
<p>Still full of the surprises and still unsatisfied living in one sonic register, the Prince on “Private Joy” moves into a disco bassline breakdown towards the end of the track where that other well known voice—as in the lowdown, get-underneath-your-clothes-and-talk-dirty-to-you commanding Prince voice—emerges to announce that he’s defeated all competing suitors for your love: “Strangled Valentino/Been mine ever since/If anybody asks you/you belong to Prince…” A spiraling guitar solo closes “Private Joy” and burns with annihilating fire into the most pointedly political track on the album, “Ronnie Talk to Russia.”</p>
<p>Hell hath no fury like Prince delivering a no nukes message, even if this track’s literal bluntness lacks the lyrical poetry of <i>Controversy’s</i> sonic inventiveness. A hail of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1923-jimi-hendrix/"">Hendrix</a> “Machine Gun” guitar feedback and drum fills open the track and carry out the frenzy of Prince’s appeal for global diplomacy as a solution to the threat of mass catastrophe. It’s the shortest track on the album, more like a concise, high-voltage nightmare interlude where he chooses not to linger. Just as quickly as it’s started, the track is done, blown to bits and leaving Prince to get back to the hard labor of deep, gritty, gratifying movement on “Let’s Work,” an exquisite, mid-tempo dance track with a sinuously insistent bass line that fuels the electric slide togetherness of the party.</p>
<p>What often catches people off guard about <i>Controversy</i> is its dramatic mood swings, particularly in the final few songs of the record. From the celebratory heat of “Let’s Work,” the record careens towards the dark techno-goth-rock nadir on “Annie Christian,” a parable in which Prince, with overdubs, recites (rather than sings) the dizzying tragedy and persistent anxieties that come with fame in the age of early ‘80s celebrity assassination and assassination attempts. “Annie Christian/Annie Christ,” the obsessive fan figure circa 1980/1981, prowls the streets in the wake of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">John Lennon</a>’s murder and the Jodie Foster-inspired shooting of Reagan (“She tried to kill Reagan/ Everybody say gun control…”). As the speaker resolves to “live” his “life in taxicabs” until this femme fatale is “crucified,” one hears the kind of haunting paranoia (laced with just a mild bit of sexist mythology) that surfaces several decades later on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>’s albums during those moments when he does battle with “Lucy” (Lucifer) for his soul.</p>
<p>Prince, to the very end, though, is at heart an optimist and an artist who chooses to fight the demons of the world with his superhero virtuosity as a musician, as a man of deep (and sometimes shifting) faith, and as a champion of and protector of black culture as the bedrock of modern sound and salvation. He was also a humorist, a prankster, and a trickster, itself a supremely African-American expressive tradition used as a means to survival. And so <i>Controversy</i>, a dead serious album, ends with the sounds of high levity and inanity on “Jack U Off,” a bald-faced, high-tempo braggadocio track all awash in synths. To close this album, his highness turns to pornographic farce, fun and games in a song that at once invokes early rock’n’roll guitar and '80s pop. He gives us a blue Little Richard ditty for the Reagan era but minus the family-friendly innuendo and assures us that we’ll find pleasure together in these uncertain times.</p></div>"|21843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21843-controversy/|9.0|Daphne A.

He had spent a full year fine-tuning his sound, his band, his look, and his story for <i>Purple Rain</i>, with the explicit goal of conquering the world. And it had worked perfectly—repositioning himself as a badass guitar hero and fronting a band which included multiple genders and races had opened up new audiences for him, and made him the biggest rock star in the universe.</p>
<p>But as soon as he reached that peak, that rarefied altitude so few artists get to see, Prince realized what being a superstar required. He knew that to meet the demand for his music, to feed the beast of the celebrity he had attained, he would be expected to keep pushing <i>Purple Rain</i> for all it was worth—to tour the U.S., then go to Europe, maybe to Australia, then back for a bigger U.S. victory lap. But Prince was too restless for that. And so he did the only thing he always knew how to do: He made more music, which sounded different from anything he had done or anything his new fans might have expected.</p>
<p><i>Around the World in a Day</i> was completed on Christmas Eve of 1984 and released in April 1985, just two weeks after the final date on the <i>Purple Rain</i> tour—which Prince cut short abruptly, after just six months. His breakthrough album was still riding high on the charts.</p>
<p>He had quietly been working on the new album in scattered sessions that had actually started prior to <i>Purple Rain</i>’s release, without the knowledge of his label, Warner Bros.; even members of his band, the Revolution, didn’t know that a new project was underway, much less completed. “I wasn’t totally aware that he had been tracking that album,” said keyboardist Matt Fink. “I was not involved in it…I was okay with it, but at the same time, you always want to be in there if you can.”</p>
<p>The most noticeable thing about <i>Around the World in a Day</i> was what it wasn’t: It wasn’t remotely a sequel to <i>Purple Rain</i>. On first listen, it was instantly clear that the album was a dramatic left-turn, with none of the flashy guitar and few of the pop hooks. The sound was bright and sweet, as opposed to low-end raunch. If Prince had streamlined and rocked up his approach for global domination, now he was creating something more intimate, cerebral, and challenging.</p>
<p>Though <i>Around the World</i> was released with no radio single or advance promotion—“This has got to be the easiest album I’ve ever worked on,” Warner Bros. creative marketing chief Jeff Ayeroff said—the first taste for most listeners wasn’t too shocking. The irresistibly playful “Raspberry Beret” was in fact the most pure pop Prince had ever delivered. (I clearly remember hearing him play the song alone at the piano during the <i>Purple Rain</i> show I attended that spring, and the crowd went nuts, singing along by the second chorus.)</p>
<p>But “Raspberry Beret” was actually a song he had written a few years earlier, and was a bit of an outlier on the album. The real linchpin for the project was a demo that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33691-the-revolution/"">Revolution</a> members Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman brought him, a track that had been recorded by their respective brothers, David Coleman and Jonathan Melvoin. It was a shimmery, winding instrumental with flutes and strings reminiscent of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> circa <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13436-magical-mystery-tour/"">Magical Mystery Tour</a></i>. Prince loved its sound and feel, and he began to build the album around the psychedelic sensibility of this song, which would ultimately give the album its title.</p>
<p>The album cover—a painting depicting the Revolution in a trippy, candy-colored landscape—clearly evoked <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13435-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band/"">Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></i>. The first sounds you heard backed up this reference; the record kicked off with a keening Middle Eastern flute, and Prince’s first line is “Open your heart, open your mind.” This vision of a mystical journey for which “laughter is all you pay” was followed by “Paisley Park,” a depiction of Prince’s dream world (and, for those paying attention, the name of his new label imprint, for which <i>Around the World</i> was the first release) where “admission is easy/ Just say U believe,” and whose inhabitants feel only “profound inner peace.”</p>
<p>At the time, this utopian hippie bliss was the most obvious element of <i>Around the World in a Day</i>. “Prince goes psychedelic” was the common hot take, with all of the naïve optimism that implied. Several of the songs opened with fairy-tale introductions—“Once upon a time in the land of Sinaplenty” or “There was a girl in Paris.” Over time, though, what emerged was a much darker undertone running through the album. Even “Paisley Park” included a betrayed wife whose husband died “without knowing forgiveness” and a man crying as his house is condemned.</p>
<p>Over a loosely thudding drum sound, “Pop Life” (the album’s other Top 10 hit) was a skeptical meditation on the trappings of success, the lure of drugs and anti-intellectualism. “Everybody can’t be on top,” Prince sang with a hint of a sneer, “But life it ain’t real funky, unless it’s got that pop.” It was the moment that first articulated the creative tension that would play out over the rest of his career; was Prince more naturally a stadium-filling superstar or was he really the world’s biggest cult artist, with a dedicated following ready to follow him down which musical path he chose?</p>
<p>The album’s most conventional-sounding rock song was in some ways the oddest of all—was “America” a patriotic anthem without irony, an anti-communist manifesto written at the height of Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America,” or a savage attack on that mentality? Prince sang about a girl “making minimum wage/ Living in a one-room jungle monkey cage…she may not be in the black/ But she’s happy she ain’t in the red.” Tougher to interpret than “Born in the USA,” the song also allowed Prince to indulge his fantasies of nuclear apocalypse that went back to “1999” and “Ronnie, Talk to Russia.”</p>
<p>Some of the most striking moments on <i>Around the World</i> were the most compositionally experimental. The jittery, sexually-charged funk of “Tamborine” never fully coheres into a complete song, stretching the tension almost unbearably thin. “Condition of the Heart,” its jazz chords unfolding over an impossibly slow tempo as Prince maintains an inhuman falsetto, is as delicate as a spider’s web, threatening to fall apart at any moment.</p>
<p>As the album nears its conclusion, things get genuinely mystifying, and we get the clearest sense of the issues Prince was grappling with in the aftermath of <i>Purple Rain</i>. “The Ladder” is a bewildering parable of a king “who didn’t deserve 2 B,” and who embarks on a spiritual quest. The reward he (and we all) receive for “looking for the ladder,” Prince sings, building up his testifying vocal screams over slow-swinging, traditional gospel chords, is that “a feeling of self-worth will caress U/ The size of the whole wide world will decrease.”</p>
<p>There’s a remarkable co-writing credit on this curious epic, as well as on the title cut—John L. Nelson, Prince’s father, whose conflict with his son was spun into the fictional emotional center of the <i>Purple Rain</i> movie. A jazz pianist, Nelson even attended Prince’s initial presentation of the album at the Warner Bros. offices, clad in a caftan. What could it possibly mean that this father-son reconciliation and collaboration resulted in such dense, almost coded lyrics, with such a desperate yearning for salvation?</p>
<p>The final track on <i>Around the World</i> took things even farther. At some of the <i>Purple Rain</i> shows, Prince stopped the music to engage in actual on-stage conversations with God. Unlike his R&amp;B sex symbol predecessors like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, Prince had never seemed tortured by the relationship between sex and faith; rather than defining physical love as sin, he had embraced sex as an earthly manifestation of the divine spirit. But clearly there was some new guilt pulling at him, some reaction to his success or his lifestyle, and it is documented on the eight-minute-plus “Temptation.”</p>
<p>Reeling off spiky, fuzzed-out guitar licks, Prince practically drools his expressions of desire; “Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust,” he squeals, shrieks, leers. Eddie M.’s saxophone gives the song an almost comic burlesque strut as Prince works himself into a sexual frenzy. Until another voice comes down from the heavens: “Oh, silly man, that’s not how it works/ You have 2 want her 4 the right reasons/""I do!""/ U don’t, now die!”</p>
<p>Prince ends the album having learned his lesson—that “love is more important than sex”—and by saying goodbye to his audience. “I have 2 go now,” he whispers, “I don’t know when I’ll return.” And indeed, just a few weeks before the release of <i>Around the World in a Day</i>, Prince announced his “retirement” from live performance; it may have been sincere at the time, but it was barely a year later when he was back on tour, this time for the <i>Parade</i> album.</p>
<p>With the momentum of <i>Purple Rain</i> behind it—or, more precisely, with the momentum still going full tilt—<i>Around the World</i> sold over two million copies; no Prince record would ever be as commercially successful in his lifetime. But the album didn’t capture the public imagination to anywhere near the degree that <i>Purple Rain</i> had. If anything, its lilting textures and cryptic lyrics served to confuse a large portion of the fans attracted by the girls-and-guitars spirit of the motorcycle riding, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1923-jimi-hendrix/"">Jimi Hendrix</a>-meets-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a> image the movie had cultivated. Which, of course, seemed to be his intention, his only possible way out of competing with a world-changing, life-changing phenomenon.</p>
<p>But it’s unfair to only consider the album as a defensive maneuver or a strategy to keep his future options open. It was also a brave and deeply personal project, exploring sounds and ideas that were almost shocking coming from a pop icon at his peak. “I sorta had an f-you attitude,” Prince told legendary Detroit DJ the Electrifying Mojo about his mood while recording <i>Around the World in a Day</i>, “meaning that I was making something for myself and my fans. And the people who supported me through the years—I wanted to give them something, and it was like my mental letter. And those people are the ones who wrote me back, telling me that they felt what I was feeling.”</p></div>"|21847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21847-around-the-world-in-a-day/|8.8|Alan Light

The post-punk pioneers’ discography is one of abrupt but clean breaks, with prolonged periods of inactivity that neatly group their records into distinct phases—which the band and fans cheekily refer to as Marks, like upgraded models of the same sports car. It’s almost as if they’ve always approached their work as discrete discs in a career-retrospective box set, with each era defined by a specific aesthetic approach or change in personnel.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Not surprisingly, for a band so self-aware of their legacy, Wire have been very selective about what songs make it onto their official albums. At the same time, they’re not ones to let leftovers go to waste—they’re committed to giving aborted material its proper due and consideration, no matter if it takes several years to work it into proper shape. Their 2013 release, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17720-wire-change-becomes-us/"">Change Become Us</a></i>, comprised updated versions of songs written in 1980 but only captured on a crude live recording from the era. The new <i>Nocturnal Koreans</i> likewise salvages scrapped material, though its shelf life can be measured in months rather than decades—the mini-LP features eight songs that were recorded alongside the 11 featured on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20472-wire/""><span class=""s2"">Wire’s 2015 self-titled effort</span></a>, but didn’t make it onto the album.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">According to the band, the songs featured on <i>Wire</i> lent themselves to more of a live approach, whereas the tracks compiled on and reworked for <i>Nocturnal Koreans</i> encouraged a greater degree of studio manipulation. But the two releases still sound like byproducts of the same moment—<i>Wire</i> was hardly lacking for textural trickery, while <i>Nocturnal Koreans </i>accommodates a couple of rockers. Furthermore, the atypical tools employed here (trumpet, lap-steel guitar) are treated less as feature attractions than soluble materials to be mutated and absorbed into the band’s soundstream. Whereas <i>Wire</i> effectively found this perennially re-inventive band settling into a comfort zone of sorts, forging the melodic middle ground between post-punk whirr and Krautrock swirl, <i>Nocturnal Koreans</i> uses that album’s brisk, motorik pop as its jumping-off point. Chronicling an experience with mid-tour insomnia, the opening title track masterfully mediates between inner-city tension and dream-world reverie, with frontman Colin Newman’s bleary-eyed mental haze (“I dressed in my shower before I awoke”) rendered through an encroaching, droning buzz that gradually blurs the edges of the song’s incessant backbeat.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">True to that nighttime scene-setter, <i>Nocturnal Koreans</i> ranks among Wire’s most musically relaxed releases, with Newman mostly singing in calm, sometimes hushed tones. But it’s only relaxed in the sense that a sleepless night in your bedroom is relaxed—the pillows and sheets feel familiar, but your thoughts are riddled with anxieties over the unknown. While the droll, dry “Internal Exile” may deliver its critique of cutthroat capitalism with a smirk (“Hearts of gold/ No pot to piss in/ Join the queue of future has-beens”), its tense acoustic stalk and prodding chorus apply palpable pressure. The more wiry—and typically Wire-y— “Numbered” packs in a cheeky callback to one of the band’s signature songs (“You think I’m a number/ Still willing to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QykauA8p14"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">rhumba</span></a>”), yet that knowing nod only reinforces the new track’s doomsday messaging. Those apocalyptic intimations are rendered all the more starkly through the dead-of-night stillness of “Forward Motion,” whose eerie, frosty ambience swells into a mushroom cloud of lingering cold-war paranoia.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s easy to see how something like “Forward Position” was deemed too much of an aesthetic outlier to fit in with the <i>Wire</i> tracklist. But there are also a handful of tracks here (“Dead Weight,” “Still,” “Pilgrim Trade”) that seem like mere victims of attrition—functional, pro-forma songs that try to boost their mid-tempo pulse by piling on synth and noise textures. So when bassist Graham Lewis steps up to take his lone, lead vocal on the closing “Fishes Bones,” it’s a welcome jolt, his leering lyrics (“The back door’s open, are you needing a boost?/ Inside is where my chicken roost”) providing an absurdist counterpoint to Newman’s more contemplative observations. As per Wire’s 21st century M.O., it’s a song that obliquely references the band’s prior work—in this case, the strobe-lit, lockstep assault of late-’80s standards like “(A Berlin) Drill.” But it uses nostalgia like a slingshot, pulling back to the past as a means to shoot forth into the future.</span></p></div>"|21715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21715-nocturnal-koreans/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Of course, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7234-krs-one/"">KRS-One</a> gave audiences a new vocabulary for questioning the power structure, which the majority of hip-hop acts rail against in some form or another anyway. Today, we can point to several contemporary acts—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/840-the-coup/"">The Coup</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2127-immortal-technique/"">Immortal Technique</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"">Killer Mike</a>, etc.—whose rhetoric follows the same path, but none can claim to be as musically subversive as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27689-dalek/"">Dälek</a>, an outfit that almost two decades ago fulfilled hip-hop's potential to exist in an alt/underground/experimental universe while staying true to its roots.</p>
<p>Dälek (a play on the word ""dialect"") parlayed atypical hip-hop inspirations—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">The Velvet Underground</a>, etc.—into sumptuous billows of noise. Groundbreaking albums like 2002's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2148-from-filthy-tongue-of-gods-and-griots/"">From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots</a></i>, 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2149-absence/"">Absence</a></i>, 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9968-abandoned-language/"">Abandoned Language</a></i>, and 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12595-gutter-tactics/"">Gutter Tactics</a></i> combined the brutalistic drive of industrial music, the density and grain of heavy guitar music, the painterly textures of ambient music, and the thumping backbeat groove of classic hip-hop. And while it makes sense that the band landed on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5804-mike-patton/"">Mike Patton</a>'s Ipecac label and on stages with the likes of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"">Melvins</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4262-tool/"">Tool</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"">Godflesh</a>, it bears repeating what an ongoing accomplishment it has been for Dälek to break down barriers while keeping both feet planted firmly in hip-hop.</p>
<p>On <i>Asphalt for Eden</i>, Dälek returns with a revamped lineup after going on hiatus in 2010 upon the departure of co-founding producer Oktopus (Alap Momin). That the new incarnation—frontman/bandleader MC Dälek (Will Brooks), longtime Dälek guitarist-turned-producer Mike Manteca, and DJ rEk (Rudy Chicata), the group's original DJ back in '95-'96—manages to craft yet another hybrid of hip-hop with outside elements isn't especially surprising. It isn't even necessarily all that surprising that Dälek 2.0 goes a long way towards reinventing its sound while still retaining its essence. But no matter how used to this group's agility we've become, it doesn't make the step forward it takes on this new material any less impressive.</p>
<p>Not unlike <i>Gutter Tactics</i>, the backbeat on <i>Asphalt for Eden</i> is far less monolithic and bass-heavy, often sounding like a beat filtered through a haze of static, hip-hop as a remnant of a civilization long expired several light years away. This time, though, Manteca and Brooks (who also produces) dial back the blast-furnace intensity of that familiar Dälek wall of sound and opt instead for more delicate layers that verge on minimalist ambient electronica. But make no mistake: nothing is actually <i>missing</i> here. In fact, the stripped-down composition of the music arguably gives it more power than Dälek's previous work. Manteca and Brooks weave together layers of sounds that they atomize into overlapping clouds of fine mist. And because they leave so much space in their arrangements, the new material reveals Dälek's ear for harmony in ways we might have felt but hadn't necessarily heard before, because the older albums packed such a strong punch in the gut.</p>
<p>As usual, Brooks addresses the encroaching forces of human control—big business, globalization, totalitarianism, post-colonial American hegemony, war, etc. This time, though, rather than make didactic statements, he focuses on the internal angst of the individual coming to terms with and trying to navigate an increasingly dehumanizing landscape. And in another fresh twist on previous work, the sounds on <i>Asphalt for Eden</i> have an almost playful tone that dithers between ominous and optimistic. An Aldous Huxley spoken-word sample over a spectral ambient throb on ""Masked Laughter (Nothing's Left),"" for example, recalls Orbital's plea to collective human awakening on their 2012 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16458-wonky/"">Wonky</a></i>.</p>
<p>Filled as it is with so many gorgeous colors,<i> Asphalt for Eden</i> could have underscored actor Rutger Hauer's iconic ""Tears in rain"" monologue at the end of <i>Blade Runner</i>. In fact, the music becomes all the more moving when it directly contrasts Brooks' chilling shards of imagery. The dulcet electronic ripples of ""Masked Laughter,"" for example, conclude with a repeating loop of the word ""terrorism."" If there were a manga based on dystopian sweatshop-induced urban poverty and that, in turn, were turned into an anime film, you couldn't do better than <i>Asphalt for Eden</i> for a soundtrack.</p>
<p>Brooks spent five years away from Dälek fronting the comparatively traditional rap group iconAclass (and doing remixes for the likes of Black Heart Procession, Zombi, Palms, Broken Flowers, etc) but he takes a huge leap on his return to Dälek, which sounds not only revived here but permanently altered not unlike a friend who comes home after years abroad—or even from a traumatic experience like, say, prison. In other words, the profundity here comes across in the most restrained gestures.</p>
<p> Though Brooks opts for a more oblique lyrical approach on these new songs, the modern horrors that populate Dälek's previous albums are never too far off, and the foreboding sense of the world going to hell in a handbasket hovers over your shoulder the entire time. The song ""Guaranteed Struggle,"" for example, contains a sample of Brooks delivering a disconnected verse fragment about ""fuck[ing] around and watch[ing] the whole world crumblin'""<i>—</i>basically, the story of our lives for anyone who can afford to spend leisure time on music or entertainment in 2016. But the more ambiguous emotional notes in the album's sonic makeup at times parallel the more subtle blossoming of consciousness also unfolding on the world stage. Dälek took hip-hop into new stylistic realms before. This time, although Brooks and company may not have specifically intended as much, on <i>Asphalt for Eden</i>, hip hop ascends into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">noosphere</a>. </p></div>"|21637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21637-asphalt-for-eden/|7.8|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

Rock is just a small piece of the greater amalgamation—a simple-yet-complex affair that welds repetitive riffing in strange time signatures to microtonal harmonies that glint like flecks of mica. It might be tempting to call it math rock, but these aren't problems to be solved—they're patterns that unfold as if of their own accord. Maybe ""biology rock"" would be more apt. It's fluid, not angular, and instead of architecture, branches and rivers and spiraling sunflower heads feel like its analogues in the physical world.</p>
<p>The Baltimore band has released two albums up to this point, both of which alternate switchbacking studies in rhythm and drone with noisy, knotty studio experiments. They've also released three freeform ""mixtapes"" containing sidelong collages of full-throttle rave-ups, modular synth sketches, and live recordings whose audio fidelity suggests that they may have been recorded to a Dictaphone at the bottom of someone's gym bag.</p>
<p><i>Interventions</i> marks a major step forward in every way: The jams are both more focused and more hypnotic, while the quality of the recordings has a newfound clarity and fullness that does wonders for the music. Guitarist Owen Gardner and bassist Max Eilbacher play instruments re-fretted according to the principles of just intonation, and their curious tuning—intermingled with saxophonist Andrew Bernstein's complementary bleat—yields an unusual and visceral sound. It's subtle, but you can feel it vibrating in the air all around you.</p>
<p>""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18091-horse-lords-truthers/"">Truthers</a>,"" which opens the album, plunges you straight into the band's muscular minimalism. Drummer Sam Haberman doles out a lurching rhythm in 6/8 time while guitar, bass, and saxophone pile up in teetering heaps. Their scales have an odd, in-between quality, neither major nor minor, that makes me think of Sahara Desert blues crossed with the smoldering skronk of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">Stooges</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11842-the-stooges-fun-house/"">Fun House</a></i>. Throughout the album, they'll return again and again to the same essential themes, and the fact that ""Toward the Omega Point,"" ""Time Slip,"" and ""Bending to the Lash"" sound like they are in the same key as ""Truthers"" lends to <i>Interventions</i>' deep sense of structural integrity. But they never stop pushing forward: The unhinged ""Toward the Omega Point,"" in which Bernstein sets aside his saxophone in order to lay down complex polyrhythms on percussion, veers into an unexpected country blues before pivoting back into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/454-glenn-branca/"">Glenn Branca</a> territory, while the brooding ""Time Slip"" overdubs guitars and sax in creamy waves over a toe-scuffing groove in five. </p>
<p>Much like their mixtapes, the excellently sequenced album is broken up by shorter, sketch-like pieces. ""Encounter I / Transfinite Flow"" braids taut guitar plucks and staccato sax blasts around one another like the strands of a double helix; ""Intervention I"" is a chiming modular synth miniature that feels like standing in the lobby of a Reno casino; and ""Encounter II / Intervention II,"" the album's still center, is a mournful saxophone solo, suffused in reverb, that sounds like it was recorded in a dank underground chamber.</p>
<p>Following the punishing onslaught of ""Bending to the Lash,"" the album closes with ""Never Ended,"" a disorienting swirl of chants and street noise recorded at the Baltimore protests following the death of Freddie Gray. You wouldn't necessarily recognize the source material, but knowing its provenance helps explain some of the album's urgency. This is a band that believes that experimental music has the potential to be more than merely aesthetic, and every one of their choices—like taking apart their instruments and rebuilding them according to an alternate musical logic—speaks to a desire to upend the status quo. Sometimes difficult and always thrilling, <i>Interventions </i>asks listeners to meet it halfway—and rewards them copiously when they do.</p></div>"|21781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21781-interventions/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

For Brian Eno, however, this kind of challenge is core to his identity as a musician. <i>The Ship</i>, Eno’s newest release and his sixth on Warp, somehow manages to feel distinct from all the work he’s done. He describes this divergence as a desire “to make a record of songs that didn’t rely on the normal underpinnings of rhythmic structure and chord progressions but which allowed voices to exist in their own space and time, like events in a landscape.” <i>The Ship</i> is broken into four tracks that more or less flow into one fluid 48-minute suite of music.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.brian-eno.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On his website Eno describes</a> his inspiration for <i>The Ship</i> as coming from, among other things, a fascination with the sinking of the Titanic and humankind’s balance “between hubris and paranoia.” That Eno should go here now is an interesting way of coming around full circle, because four decades ago he kicked off his non-pop career by issuing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oVMRADOq5s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Sinking of the Titanic</i></a> by his friend and peer Gavin Bryars. That release, which featured not only Bryars but also Michael Nyman and Derek Bailey, was <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Gavin-Bryars-The-Sinking-Of-The-Titanic/release/5955236"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the very first on Eno’s then-new Obscure label in 1975</a>, and served as one more footnote in the annals of Eno’s history in serving as a nexus for the “scenius.” (a term he coined to describe his belief that “it’s not individuals who create things, it’s scenes.”) The Bryars opus is also a double-edged sword as reference points go, because it has claimed ownership on Titanic-related musical storytelling, and it’s also incredibly good.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the comparisons end there. While Bryars’s piece, with its beautiful, looping melody and gentle, nagging insistence, conjures a feeling of an auspicious capital-M Moment whirlpooling slowly downward, Eno’s opening track “The Ship” tells a story not of submerging into sea but of floating listlessly across windless water and forever fog, waves nibbling at the bow and starboard. With a minimalist structure and languid pace, this is not music meant to be experienced or appreciated by those in a hurry, or to be played in the background; it demands your attention in a way that quiet music often doesn’t.</p>
<p>For those willing to stick it out for 21 minutes, “The Ship” unfolds with a kind of majesty that can make one feel like they’re getting their body re-calibrated. Slowly shifting synths establish both gait and mood, before eventually giving way to poem-like vocals by Eno, intoned in a sort of Gregorian chant that only serves to strengthen the feeling that you are being induced into a meditative state. They continue for several minutes before subsiding and the track’s gentle voyage continues, with pitch-shifted voice returning with the refrain “Wave, after wave, after wave.” While not ambient music, the sounds at times resemble moments from Eno’s past, including especially the burbling sounds around 5:50 that recall his work with Bowie on <i>Heroes</i>’ ""Neuköln.""</p>
<p>From here, <i>The Ship</i> gives way to the album’s second longest composition, “Fickle Sun (i),” clocking in at 18 minutes. Though the pace is a similar speed to “The Ship,” the feel is quite different, with a bass somewhere between “bounce” and “plod” and trebly, rising synths that give the track a menacing oomph. A later section seems to call upon the ’00s work of Fennesz, David Sylvian, and Scott Walker, which are good reference points for this record in general. While “The Ship” is remarkable for sustaining a specific tone for 21 minutes, all the while telling a clear story, “Fickle Sun (i)” is just as impressive, going in more directions musically and challenging the listener’s sense of understanding.</p>
<p>After these two behemoths conclude, the storm clears and we are left with two brief cuts that function more as appendices, both of which are technically parts of “(ii)” and “(iii)” of “Fickle Sun” and each of which present issues for different reasons. “(ii)”, subtitled “The Hour Is Thin,” carries the same emotional tone, but stripped down only to plaintively struck piano notes and with a spoken-word piece by Peter Serafinowicz. While the music itself fits very well here, it would have been preferable to hear Eno’s honeyed baritone instead of Serafinowicz's clinical recitation. And “Fickle Sun (iii)” is a luxurious, jaw-dropping cover of the Velvet Underground’s “I’m Set Free” emerging unexpectedly from the last twinkled notes of “The Hour is Thin.” It’s incongruous to the rest of the record, but is so painfully perfect it can make you nearly let go of everything you’ve just heard to imagine, for a second, that Eno hadn’t stopped making pop music all those years ago.</p>
<p><i>The Ship</i> is a great, unexpected record. The title track and “Fickle Sun (i)” on their own and as a connected piece of music are marvelous accomplishments, distinctive in Eno’s catalog. And “I’m Set Free” immediately ranks among the most perfect-sounding pop songs Eno has ever had a hand in making. It is a little tough to process the disparity between the minimalist front and the melodic <a href=""http://dvdsgl.co/2008/open-voting-systems/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hanging chad</a> of “I’m Set Free” at the end—and the latter is just so damned good that Eno’s pop fans may weep over being denied a full record’s worth of it. But in the end it’s easy to feel grateful that it all exists, and enthusiastic that Eno is an artist who still sees new techniques to learn and new landscapes to paint.</p></div>"|21743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21743-the-ship/|8.0|Benjamin Scheim

By now, most <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a> fans know that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1819-jonny-greenwood/"">Jonny Greenwood</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19141-jonny-greenwood-bryce-dessner-st-carolyn-by-the-sea-suite-from-there-will-be-blood/"">writes orchestra works</a>. Fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">Annie Clark</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a> may have seen those singers’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16066-ymusic-beautiful-mechanical/"">chamber-music pieces</a> show up on albums by groups such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30072-ymusic/"">yMusic</a>. One thing that has remained rare, though, is the indie-meets-classical “merged ensemble.” While someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27735-bryce-dessner/"">Bryce Dessner</a> may play guitar in a classical group, we haven’t seen him include his bandmates from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a> in any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18702-bryce-dessner-aheym-by-kronos-quartet/"">original items</a> written for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6375-kronos-quartet/"">Kronos Quartet</a>.</p>
<p>So it is genuinely notable to find the members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/"">Deerhoof</a> hanging with an elite contemporary classical group like Ensemble Dal Niente. Even more impressive is the fact that the Deerhoof players aren’t here to perform arrangements of their own music. Instead, this collaborative album opens with Dal Niente and Deerhoof tearing through a seven-movement suite by Brazilian-American composer Marcos Balter, titled ""meltDown Upshot."" This 23-minute opus takes full advantage of this mega-ensemble’s chamber chops and rock edge—just like you’d hope—but it doesn’t stop there. When he’s not indulging in minimalist-inspired patterns or proggy progressions, Balter also includes some gestures that sound copped from the world of avant-jazz.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of textures for any one composer to handle well. Though Balter pulls it off. His writing engages with the diverse talents of this group without ever feeling choppy. The contemplative first movement, “Credo,” places the delicate (but confident) vocals of Deerhoof’s Satomi Matsuzaki over writing for strings and piano that often glides over the minor second interval—a doleful semitone hop that receives tender-lullaby handling, here. The second movement introduces Greg Saunier’s drums and Ed Rodriguez’s electric guitar arpeggios, and it has a lightly propulsive feel. </p>
<p>A hint of manic writing announces the third movement, “Ready,” which is packed full of short, exciting riffs for the full ensemble, as well as saxophone squall and fast-moving vocal figures. Plucked strings, piano and Saunier’s drums animate the memorable “True/False.” Later on, “Cherubim” builds on the indie-power first introduced during “Ready.” This time, the drums and guitars hit harder—yet they don’t obscure the contributions of the Dal Niente players, either. And while this passage represents the height of freneticism during ""meltDown Upshot,"" the climax of the piece is delivered by the more optimistic-sounding harmonies of “Rapture,” the closing movement. Overall, this feels like a major composition from Balter. And it’s also a triumph for the musicians of Dal Niente and Deerhoof. The performance comes from a group that sounds <i>like a group</i>, rather than two bands taking a flier on a cross-genre experiment.</p>
<p>On the record's other long track, Dal Niente play the music of Deerhoof, as newly arranged by Saunier himself. Though, in keeping with the band’s own fragmented aesthetic, these aren’t straight-up transcriptions. The stomping chords from the beginning of “Rainbow Silhouette of the Milky Rain” (originally heard on the album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2253-milk-man/"">Milk Man</a></i>) have been pulled apart a bit in the version that appears almost four minutes into ""Deerhoof Chamber Variations."" Now the barnstorming line sounds more akin to the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/217-john-adams/"">John Adams</a>, circa that composer’s madcap <i>Chamber Symphony</i>. </p>
<p>Touches like these keep Saunier’s recasting of various Deerhoof themes from seeming under-thought. But even when the music is smart and attractive, the roving unpredictability of the band’s own performances is not always captured by these arrangements. Nor does the overall shape of this 20-minute work have the same force as Balter’s major piece. Still, Dal Niente’s playing is always vibrant, and it’s interesting to hear Saunier stretching in this way. Deerhoof and Dal Niente are both plenty busy with their more typical efforts, but their joint-venture debut sounds far too good to be a one-off.</p></div>"|21806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21806-balter-saunier/|7.6|Seth Colter Walls

These days, one’s as likely to know her for her collaborations with Scandinavian artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31232-jenny-hval/"">Jenny Hval</a>; like many in her circles, Susanna is an accomplished curator of talent, and her first self-produced album, <i>Triangle</i>, features a murderer’s row of jazz and experimental musicians, including Helge Sten of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31Yvg8Wa00"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deathprod</a> and Anja Lauvdal of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu0k-bTzAyQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skadedyr</a>.</p>
<p>With so many influences to synthesize for a first solo production, it makes sense that Susanna would go big: 22 songs, reprises and interludes and variations on themes, generally on religion and mortality. She’s described <i>Triangle </i>as “<a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2016/01/28/susanna-new-album-triangle-burning-sea/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soul music for lost souls</a>,” and the first few seconds neatly sum up her idea of this: “Nothing is holy, nothing is sacred,” she intones over a synth pitched like a chant section. <i>Triangle</i> is the sort of fully-realized work that can only come from an artist lost in her highest, headiest intellectual space. It’s also near-monastically austere, nearly 70 minutes long, and a commitment, at best, to take in as an album; in even a mildly uncharitable mood, the unending sparseness will be wearying.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, <i>Triangle </i>is best experienced in short, repeated bursts of close listening. “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17970-susanna-burning-sea/"">Burning Sea</a>” conjures waves of feedback that evoke its title, if perhaps too obviously. “We Don’t Belong” is an almost religious meditation on impermanence, Ecclesiastes arranged for solo voice and drone; when the piano comes in, it’s like anxious palpitations, scrabbling back and clinging to earth. “Born Again,” another religion-adjacent track, comes off like a deconstructed gospel song, the piano and brass collapsing where elsewhere they might exult, and Susanna’s words a subtly yet fundamentally tweaked credo: “born again, and again, and again.”</p>
<p>“Death Hanging,” in its original form, was a trio recording <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15522-susanna-death-hanging-ft-siri-nilsen-and-susanne-sundfr/"">with Susanne Sundfør and Siri Nilsen</a> in the vein of Harris/Parton/Ronstadt or Case/Lang/Veirs—folk that floats above and haunts its listener. The <i>Triangle </i>recording is a more traditional duet with Dutch mezzo <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceMRXVcsROI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Sligter</a>; from her first note, her more harrowing voice amid <i>Triangle</i>’s spare arrangements and soprano lines is instantly arresting. The arrangement, a maelstrom of cello and low strings, works much the same. Death sounds more imminent here. A little more editing and pacing might have made the whole album like this, but given enough time, <i>Triangle </i>has moments of clarity to be found.</p></div>"|21834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21834-triangle/|6.4|Katherine St. Asaph

Teenagers at the time, the two kids from Southern California’s Inland Empire region were swept up in a major label feeding frenzy and signed to Interscope in 2009. Articles popped up describing jerkin’—a descendant of clowning and krumping before it—as a “<a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/06/jerky-boys-and-girls.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">movement</a>” and Audio Push (then known as “The P.U.S.H.”) also became reluctant representatives of the SoCal’s dance scene.</p>
<p>Dancing was a part of their lifestyle but not central to it. Like many other kids from their neighborhood, they jerked but they also skated and gangbanged and prayed and—most importantly—rapped. This multi-faceted, seemingly contradictory existence is the crux of their content. In the years since their debut single they’ve been dropped and re-signed (via Hit-Boy’s HS87 imprint), and released 11 free mixtapes and EPs that have showcased their versatility. They’ve shown they can do everything from <a href=""http://www.vevo.com/watch/audio-push/Up-N-Down/USUV71001649"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">romantic rap</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwjVHzBvurU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">grimy boom bap</a> to <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/audiopush/space-jam-ft-lil-wayne-prod-by"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">turn-up anthems</a> and have collaborated with a who’s-who of artists including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32825-travi-scott/"">Travis Scott</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"">Wale</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"">Joey Bada$$</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32339-g-eazy/"">G-Eazy</a>. What they’ve yet to do, however, is have breakout success. The <i>Stone Junction</i> EP, their very first for-sale project, is a declaration of their intention to change that without compromising their positive “good vibe” message.</p>
<p>Realizing that versatility can be a liability—especially in an industry that prefers its musicians to have easily identifiable sounds—Audio Push has enlisted some of Atlanta’s premier producers to complement their distinctively Californian approach to rhyming. The beats are high energy, juxtaposing the duo’s lyricism with 808s and synths. “They wanna put me in a box/ The industry, the enemies and the cops,” raps Price on the Slade Da Monsta-produced, “BBQ Spot.” The formula works throughout the EP—the music lending intensity and urgency to their assertions of MC supremacy and descriptions of the everyday struggle.</p>
<p>Beyond beats, they get assists from ATL on the mic too: Kap G joins in for some trap-inflected wordplay on the one the album’s standouts, “Vámonos,” and Two-9’s Jace helps to slam the door shut at the end of the seven-song EP on “Same.” Still in the midst of adrenaline-pumping songs like these it’s that second half of “Hard” that teases Audio Push’s potential to make even greater, emotive music. At the 2:34 mark, the ominous, unmistakably ATL thump of producer Ducko McFli’s beat gives way to glistening piano chords and swirling strings and things get emotional. What was an aggressive backdrop for bravado becomes a vulnerable, heartfelt verse from Price: “It’s hard to see you not be yourself/ It’s hard to see you with someone else/ Hard to know your heart was broken/ And you find it hard to grow/ Wth me, and it’s hard to cope,” he confesses to some unnamed ex-lover. A brief glimpse of what’s in store, tucked away in a brief project. A moment that shows just how tough being tender can be. </p></div>"|21825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21825-the-stone-junction/|7.1|Timmhotep Aku

The surrounding context is familiar to anyone who follows popular culture. Beyoncé and Jay Z are the most famous musical couple on the planet, and Beyoncé in particular is in a great place. With 2013’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/""> <i>Beyoncé</i></a>, MJ-level talent met pop-perfectionism in a moment that defined album-cycle disruption; moreover, it was a victory lap Bey took as pop feminism's reigning goddess. Jay Z, on the other hand, is a rapper who used to rap brilliantly and sometimes still sounds good when he really tries, but his music has become secondary. Over the course of their eight-year marriage and long courtship before that, Jay Z and Beyoncé’s private relationship seemed to play out in song, in concert, and of course, in the tabloids. But Beyoncé’s “smile pretty and<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/fashion/beyonce-is-seen-but-not-heard.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> give no interviews</a>” approach to public relations over the last couple of years, combined with<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55221-beyonce-jay-z-solange-issue-statement-regarding-elevator-fight/""> “the elevator incident”</a> and subsequent speculation about the state of their marriage, and followed by their public makeup (see:<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56453-watch-beyonce-nicki-minaj-charli-xcx-ariana-grande-and-others-perform-at-the-vmas/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""> VMAs 2014</a>, On the Run Tour), has suggested that <i>something</i> has changed, but that Beyoncé would prefer we not know the specifics.</p>
<p><i>Lemonade</i> shatters this theory. If the album is to be considered a document of some kind of truth, emotional or otherwise, then it seems Beyoncé was saving the juicy details for her own story. Because nothing she does is an accident, let’s assume she understands that any song she puts her name on will be perceived as being about her own very public relationship. So what we <i>think</i> we know about her marriage after listening is the result of Beyoncé wanting us to think that. With its slate of accompanying videos, <i>Lemonade</i> is billed as Beyonce’s second ""visual album."" But here that voyeuristic feeling manifests while listening rather than viewing, given the high visibility of Bey and Jay. The songwriting is littered with scenes that seem positively cinematic, so it helps that you can imagine these characters living them: Beyoncé smelling another woman’s scent on Jay Z, her pacing their penthouse in the middle of the night before leaving a note and disappearing with Blue. <i>Lemonade</i> is a film as well, yet the album <i>itself</i> feels like a movie.</p>
<p>It’s not until the record's second half that you realize <i>Lemonade</i> has a happy ending. At first you might think that Bey is using the album to announce her divorce from Jay’s cheating ass. Because she doesn’t scold, “Don’t you ever do that to me again”—she drags her very famous, seemingly powerful husband publicly, in the process giving the world a modern-day<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FOUqQt3Kg0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> “Respect”</a> in “Don’t Hurt Yourself.” On the “7/11”-style banger “Sorry,” she turns his side-chicks into memes, which will inevitably become “better call Becky with the good hair” sweatshirts that Beyoncé can sell for $60 a pop. Best revenge is your paper.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been cheated on by someone who thought you’d be too stupid or naive to notice, you will find the first half of <i>Lemonade</i> incredibly satisfying. If you have ears and love brilliant production and hooks that stick, you'll likely arrive at the same conclusion. The run from “Hold Up” to “6 Inch” contains some of Beyoncé’s strongest work—ever, period—and a bit of that has to do with her clap-back prowess. The increasingly signature cadence, patois, and all-around attitude on <i>Lemonade</i> speaks to her status as the hip-hop pop star—but this being Bey, she doesn’t stop there. Via the album’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1116-breaking-down-beyonces-lemonade-samples/""> highly specific samples</a> and features by artists like Jack White and James Blake, <i>Lemonade</i> proves Beyoncé to also be a new kind of post-genre pop star. (Let us remember a time, not very long ago, when Bey and Jay attending a Grizzly Bear show with Solange <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/36372-jay-z-reps-for-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">made headlines</a>.)</p>
<p>Both of these attributes—a methodical rapper’s flow, an open-eared listener’s frame of reference—meet on the slowed-down stunner “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18207-beyonce-hold-up/"">Hold Up</a>,” where Beyoncé borrows an iconic Karen O turn of phrase<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/65049-vampire-weekends-ezra-koenig-explains-how-his-tweet-about-the-yeah-yeah-yeahs-became-a-beyonce-song/""> via Ezra Koenig</a>, a touch of Jamaican flavor via Diplo (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBmMU_iwe6U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">again</a>), and a plucky Andy Williams sample to fight for her man while chiding him for doing this to her (!), of all people. From there, Bey’s just like, “fuck it—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXdIK1xgfFk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">big mistake, <i>huge</i></a>” and gets (Tidal co-owner) Jack White to join her in dueting over a psychedelic soul jam and a Zeppelin sample as she scowls, “Watch my fat ass twist, boy, as I bounce to the next dick, boy.” As she accuses her husband of not being man enough to handle all of her multitudes, fury frays her voice. Even on an album stacked with some of Beyoncé’s best recorded vocal performances to date, “Don’t Hurt Yourself” has her belting to a whole other dimension—specifically, that of Janis Joplin and late-‘60s Tina Turner. This won’t be the last time Bey dips into the classic vinyl on <i>Lemonade</i>, either: see “Freedom,” which manages to both: a) speak poignantly to Civil Rights as much as personal plight, b) sound like an Adidas commercial; this means it’s the logical choice for next single, assuming Beyoncé is still releasing those.</p>
<p>Bey’s genre-hopping doesn’t always sound quite as transcendent as “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” however. Though certainly memorable (not least because it finds her name-checking the Second Amendment), “Daddy Lessons”—where a country guitar-line meets New Orleans brass in service of her Southern roots—is the least interesting chapter sonically, though the parallels it draws between Jay Z and Beyoncé’s own cheating father still make it crucial in the context of <i>Lemonade</i>’s narrative. It’s hard to see how Beyoncé could have done without any of these scenes to tell the story (not even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17969-beyonce-formation/"" target=""_blank"">“Formation”</a> in the end-credits), and though the specific sounds may not be as forward-thinking as those of her 2013 self-titled, there are clear reasons for every musical treatment she has made here. <i>Lemonade</i> is a stunning album, one that sees her exploring sounds she never has before. It also voices a rarely seen concept, that of the album-length ode to infidelity. Even stranger, it <i>doesn’t</i> double as an album-length ode to breaking up.</p>
<p>Yes, after Beyoncé makes nearly half an album’s worth of glorious rage songs directed at an unfaithful partner, she gives it a little time and remembers that she was raised to value hard work and spirituality. And so, she can’t give up on her marriage, the same one she spent her last two albums (mostly) celebrating. Beyoncé even kind of sells it, surmising with a tear-inducing sincerity on relaxed-fit soul jam “All Night” that “nothing real can be threatened.” It’s an easy platitude to make, but it’s also an extremely Beyoncé way of looking at things. For a perfectionist who controls her image meticulously, Beyoncé is obsessed with the notion of realness. That’s the biggest selling point of an album like <i>Lemonade</i>, but there’s a quality to it that also invites skepticism: That desire to basically art-direct your own sobbing self-portrait to make sure your mascara smears in the most perfectly disheveled way. But who cares what's ""real"" when the music delivers a truth you can use. </p></div>"|21867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21867-lemonade/|8.5|Jillian Mapes

In Rocky’s case, he brought a strong sense of fashion, with musical branches extending to Houston and Atlanta. Ferg stayed with the conventions of trap music, though his cadence and lyricism diverted from the genre’s formulaic sound. And just like that, the<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17921-aap-ferg-trap-lord/""> <i>Trap Lord</i> </a>was born. His debut was aptly titled, full of chest-beating cuts that suggested Ferg was artsier than Rocky and slightly more overbearing—the Kanye to his Jay. But what happens when you’ve run out of superlatives for yourself and self-reflection kicks in? Well, you work in reverse, which is exactly where Ferg resides on his follow-up project <i>Always Strive and Prosper</i>. If Ferg secured a strong group of followers off <i>Trap Lord</i>, then his new album will surely lock them down as a cult.</p>
<p>An argument could be made that <i>ASAP</i> is the prequel to <i>Trap Lord</i>, where we’re finally understanding the Bruce Wayne before the Batman. But the underlying self-awareness suggests that Ferg has tasted fame and rejected the poisonous parts. The opener “Rebirth” makes that declaration in no uncertain terms. Over a joint production effort of DJ Khalil and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a>, a chopped-and-screwed Ferg talks to himself: “Now that you’re no longer a lord that’s trapped/ You have graduated to the Hood Pope/ You have made it to represent your people/ Show them another way/ Be the voice of the people who couldn’t make it out the hood.”</p>
<p>This is no longer about A$AP Ferg, but Darold Ferguson, Jr. (Ferg’s given name), who came back home after being out in the world to report on what he’s seen. Production-value is high, with Ferg enlisting top-tier beatmakers like the aforementioned DJ Khalil but also No I.D., <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>. But the beats take a backseat to the lyrics. The overall sound remains intact, but he’s even more invested in what he’s saying. </p>
<p>The track “Strive” brings a deep house vibe—compliments of Mustard and Stelios Phili—as Ferg shares the cautionary tale of sitting at a basic job with bigger dreams but refusing to trap like the rest of them. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"">Missy Elliott</a> is the icing on the cake, bringing an evenly ambitious verse, turning what could have been a simple dance track into something so much more. Missy isn’t the only notable collaborator on the project. <i>ASAP</i> boasts an all-star lineup ranging from Chris Brown and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> on the breezy “I Love You” to Rick Ross on the violently spacey “Swipe Life” and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7233-chuck-d/"">Chuck D</a> on “Beautiful People,” also featuring his Mama Ferg. The family theme runs throughout <i>Always Strive and Prosper</i>. The idea of affording luxuries for his mother remains at the forefront (buying his mama a house on “Swipe Life”), but so does his family in general. His Uncle “Psycho” gets his own song, as does his “Grandma,” and there’s a strong desire on Ferg’s part to be a family man. </p>
<p>Stargate makes a smart appearance, producing “Let You Go,” which has the capacity to own the summer on beat alone, as does “Let It Bang” with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30134-schoolboy-q/"">ScHoolboy Q</a>, only in an entirely different part of town. The deluxe version caps off <i>Always Strive and Prosper</i> with one vital cut—the quintessential New York joint “Don’t Mine” with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"">French Montana</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7480-fabolous/"">Fabolous</a>—and one recklessly unnecessary one, the aggressively average “Back Hurt” with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>. While Ferg is aware of his new station in music, there a few slip-ups where he falls back on style over substance. But not nearly enough to disqualify his epiphany.</p>
<p>There’s an important allegory woven through the fabric of A$AP Ferg’s <i>Always Strive and Prosper</i>: A$AP Ferg likes his fame, but doesn’t need it. He’s making this transition from Trap Lord to Hood Pope, attempting to address his congregation of all the perils that come with celebrity. It’s a vulnerable position in which to be in, following a self-proclaimed <i>lord</i> status. But strip away the features, strip the beats, strip the quirky nicknames, and you’re left with Darold’s wise words, coming through loud and clear.</p></div>"|21826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21826-always-strive-and-prosper/|7.3|Kathy Iandoli

The ensuing rivalry, whether spoken or unspoken, typically pits the eccentric against the centrist—see Mars Volta vs. Sparta, Lennon vs. McCartney, Wilco vs. Son Volt, or Andre 3000 vs. Big Boi. For those who <i>must</i> choose sides in following the dissolution of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28000-the-smith-westerns/"">Smith Westerns</a>, which saw former guitarist Max Kakacek breaking off from the band to form <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33506-whitney/"">Whitney</a>, an immediate tonal difference can be identified: Whitney plays breezy AM radio-indie; Lead singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33302-cullen-omori/"">Cullen Omori</a> made a solo record and called it <i>New Misery</i>.</p>
<p>So it’s up to Omori to further the emotional trajectory the Smith Westerns established over their three LPs. While they grew from reckless, glam-punk wunderkinds to the verge of maturity, the best Smith Westerns songs (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12032-the-smith-westerns-weekend/"">“Weekend,""</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12076-the-smith-westerns-all-die-young/"">“All Die Young”</a>) were the sound of young men seeing their golden days dissolving in front of their eyes in real time. Their success was enviable by just about any standard, but now that the smoke has cleared, Omori is now saddled with the expected problems of someone who skipped college to be in a modestly popular rock band: <a href=""http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/cullen-omori-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">financial instability and a lack of marketable skills</a>.</p>
<p>There are points here where Omori directly invokes his previous band’s rep as <a href=""http://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/smith-westerns-dye-it-blonde-album-review"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hedonist brats</a> amongst the genteel indie rock acts that defined the early part of the decade, but his malaise is typically drawn broadly enough to not offend the specifics of any quarter-life crisis. “Wrote a letter to my former self/ Saying ‘thanks for knowing when to give up’,” he smirks on “No Big Deal,” speaking to the regrets and fear recognizable to anyone who invested their formative years in something that left them unprepared to face the future. Sure, an early highlight of <i>New Misery </i>is a sleepwalk of drowsy harmonies and slide guitar reminiscent of <i>All Things Must Pass</i>. But its sentiment is a far more cynical rendering of the same idea: “And Yet the World Still Turns.”</p>
<p>Omori has never been the most personal songwriter, so the context of <i>New Misery </i>gives an easy entry and a new way to experience a style that has remained mostly intact since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18110-the-smith-westerns-soft-will/"">Soft Will</a></i>. Very little of it can be described as “rock,” none of it as “punk,” the result of Omori trying to emulate the top 40 music he’d hear in hospitals while working with a medical supply company. <i>New Misery </i> provides sturdy melodies throughout; as with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"">Tame Impala</a>’s Kevin Parker, Omori’s voice ensures that he’ll always approach pop sounding like a classic rock throwback, though he doesn’t have the same taste for adventure or sonic precision.</p>
<p><i>New Misery’s </i>filler doesn’t lie in the songs themselves, but rather <i>within </i>them, the predictable indulgences of both solo albums and transitions from guitar to synthesizers. The instrumental sections that of “And Yet the World Still Turns” and “Lom” meander rather than mesmerize, overdubs add distance rather than depth, Shane Stonebeck’s production slathers reverb on every instrument, turning even the coke-sniffing <i>Drive</i>-pop of “Cinnamon” into aural taffy.</p>
<p>The razored leads of Kakacek were often the thing that could draw boundaries on Smith Westerns songs as they became increasingly reliant on reverb and Chris Coady’s humidified production. Omori hasn’t quite figured out how to replace them; “Poison Dart” and “Sour Silk” would be gorgeous Smith Western ballads without the time-stamped, sci-fi synths that feel like placeholders. He certainly doesn’t need any implication that Kakacek and Julien Ehrlich’s absence are palpable and sorely missed here; after all, the reception of Whitney’s <i>Light Upon the Lake </i>singles has them well-positioned to play afternoon festival slots for at least the next two years. But that’s where the non-musical context of <i>New Misery </i>comes into play—it’s a transitional album in all senses, more intent on Omori getting lost inside himself before he tries to move forward.</p></div>"|21838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21838-new-misery/|6.2|Ian Cohen

For every vulnerable song there's another that feels insufferably ironic, and all of the above are unwaveringly libidinous, some more mature than others. Returning now with the five-song, 16-minute <i>Double Ecstasy</i> EP, Antwon has refined his vision as well as his aesthetic choices, but the overall message remains consistent. He's still a conflicted hedonist, adept at both indulgence and self-loathing.</p>
<p><i>Double Ecstasy</i> makes more sense sonically than Antwon's previous work. The diffuse cloud rap of 2014's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19262-antwon-heavy-hearted-in-doldrums/"">Heavy Hearted in Doldrums</a></i>, which made any genuine confessions feel like jokes, has been replaced with pounding club-ready songs. On ""Luv,"" Antwon openly raps about visiting the strip club to make himself feel happy like his friends (who consume drugs, in their own right, to ease life's pain), but at the most audible on the hook, he wouldn't dare say he's going to ""the booty club"" to ""fall in love.""</p>
<p>""Luv"" is an important step forward for Antwon, as it's one of the rare times he sounds at home over an instrumental that's as powerful as his natural vocal delivery. On ""Girl, Flex,"" however, Antwon falls right back into his musical and behavioral traps, rapping bland and juvenile lines like ""I'm chillin' with my lil bitch at the mall."" Unlike ""Luv,"" there's no self examination, and he doesn't make sex sound particularly fun.</p>
<p>When artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> rap about excess, they're so beyond the pale or dejected that trauma is clear. But Antwon never manages that level of complexity. Still, the songs on <i>Double Ecstasy</i> are enjoyable and, at times, captivating. They're uptempo and Antwon's voice is inviting, his delivery incredibly consistent. But the EP also leaves the rapper at a crossroads. He could continue to make solid tracks that occasionally pop when all the circumstances align, or he could further explore his more confessional side, but at this point, it would make sense for him to commit one way or another.</p></div>"|21837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21837-double-ecstasy-ep/|6.9|Matthew Strauss

A previous full-length and more than a dozen singles were rendered obsolete; this rang out as Stott's ""true"" sound and self. The bruising and bleak dirges were diametrically opposed to the dub techno of his earlier work, its depth of bass aligned more with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"">Demdike Stare</a>. Through albums like<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/"">Luxury Problems</a></i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20021-andy-stott-faith-in-strangers/"">Faith in Strangers</a>, the silty sound palette evoked dour industrial spaces even as Stott let in more and more light, primarily by folding in the voice of his onetime piano teacher Alison Skidmore. Much like one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"">David Lynch</a>'s blondes, she was the one beacon of light in human darkness.</p>
<p>For most of <i>Too Many Voices</i>, it sounds like the end of that cycle, suggesting that the grimy sonic template that defined Stott and earned him fans in noise and experimental circles the past five years ultimately might just be a phase itself rather than a final iteration. If anything, Stott sounds like <i>Blue Velvet</i>’s Jeffrey Beaumont, pulled between those two worlds, still dabbling in dark, abrasive textures while also moving towards something airier. ""Butterflies"" best exemplifies that split. On the hand it keeps the sluggish rhythm that underpinned his previous tracks. But rather than sounding weighted by granite it feels untethered, the beat landing like ping pong balls instead of boulders. A melody shrieks through, but the mood is no longer foreboding and the effect more enervating than haunting. And where Skidmore’s vocals once gave tracks such as this a thrilling contrast, against these thinner backdrops, now they are turned into mere wisps.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the tracks feel unfinished, such as ""Selfish,"" wherein Stott takes a preset that sounds like a monkey wrench on cheap plastic. It’s the album’s trickiest beat, bringing to mind early dancehall, early '00s grime and even a bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>’s ""Idioteque,"" but Stott does very little with the beat or with Skidmore's voice, just speeding up and slowing down both elements. "" The distorted beat of ""On My Mind"" and gaseous synths might be the start of something, but Stott seems reluctant to add layers in-between. The inverse applies to the title track, with Skidmore’s voice existing in multiples but with little around them. There’s plenty of low and high end, but none of the gray in-between. It makes for an album that sounds more like backing tracks missing the singer and the song to complete them. If anything, <i>Too Many Voices</i> sounds like it has too few.</p>

This past Record Store Day, Portland's Jackpot Records reissued James's masterwork, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Last!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, on limited edition vinyl, including the four bonus tracks which first appeared on a CD reissue in 1999. More than a half-century after its release, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Last!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> remains one of the greatest records about loneliness ever made: a languid, jazz-inflected paean to (reluctantly) working it out on your own. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">James was born in 1938, in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, as Jamesetta Hawkins. She never knew her father, and her mother was only fourteen when she gave birth. James was raised by a series of foster parents, and came of age singing in the Echoes of Eden choir at St. Paul's Baptist church. Stories of her childhood— including the ones she recounts herself in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rage to Survive</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, her tellingly titled autobiography—are grisly. One of her foster parents, a loutish man called Sarge, used to drag her from bed in the middle of the night and force her, via brutal and humiliating beatings, to sing for a cabal of his drunk poker cronies. In the early 1950s, she joined a girl group (the Creolettes; later the Peaches) and met the R&amp;B producer Johnny Otis, who suggested she re-name herself–transmuting ""Jamesetta"" into ""Etta James""–and eventually helped the Peaches book a spot opening for Little Richard on a national tour. James left the group to sign with Chess Records, and began collaborating with Harvey Fuqua, then of the Moonglows and later a crucial, visionary producer for Motown. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Last!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, her debut album, was released by Argo, Chess's jazz imprint, in the fall of 1961. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If there's anything anachronistic about </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Last!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, it's how plainly vulnerable James sounds while performing these songs. Insomuch as it's possible to distill any one theme from the last couple decades of pop music, it's the presentation of—and insistence upon—self-empowerment as an infallible path toward joy. Those sorts of affirmations can induce a wild ecstasy in the moment—I AM THE BEST! NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME! SUCK A DICK, JERKS!—but eventually, one has to worry about whether those same notions are not, in fact, a deeply odious and toxic force in the world. It can't be </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">great</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> for whole generations to come of age hollering self-aggrandizing anthems that never quite acknowledge the most gratifying and dangerous thing a human being can actually do: courageously make room for another person in her heart.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So when James loses her man, and sings a verse like this one, from ""Stormy Weather""—""Life is bare, gloom and mis'ry everywhere / Stormy weather, stormy weather / And I just can't get my poor self together / I'm weary all of the time, the time / So weary all of the time""—it sounds fearless. Most of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Last!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> concerns itself with unmitigated heartache. James isn't the sort of singer capable of or interested in couching true anguish in anything prettier or more reassuring, and there is a glorious synchronicity between the frankness of her vocal and the heaviness of the lyrics. James was a professional, and a true expert—her control is astounding; she bites off each note like she's taking a chunk out of an apple—but there's no moment on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Last!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that feels explicitly or distractingly performative. There's something almost punctured in her breath, like a person who has been struck in the chest, effectively felled by pain. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">James opines, repeatedly and without guile, her inability to find and keep the right person for her to love. There are moments where she thinks that she had it, maybe, for a minute (like on ""Anything to Say You're Mine,"" in which she waits for a letter from her lover, hoping their correspondence might finally reveal his devotion to her), and then moments in which she is convinced she has already lost, and will continue losing – that the ecstatic, unspooling, true, true love she watches other people share and celebrate will elude her forever. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The latter idea reaches a kind of brutal apotheosis on ""Sunday Kind of Love,"" in which James sings, over a spare, barely-tinkling piano melody (interrupted, on occasion, by rising swells of strings), about what she wants but can't ever seem to get: an earnest communion that lasts long past Saturday night, ""for all my life to have and to hold."" James isn't necessarily having a tough time attracting men to her bedroom, but she can't seem to land a caring or truly unafraid partner. Periodically, James lets out a little ""Uh!"" between lines of the verse. Those little vocal punctuations are commonplace now, but when James looses one, even the quickest, most under-thought ""Uh!"" communicates tremendous certainty. She knows what she wants, even (especially) as it remains just out of her reach.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What's maybe most satisfying about </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Last!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is the record's title track, arguably the single greatest unburdening ever laid to tape. It plays like a person stumbling into a hotel room and simultaneously dropping all of her bags on the floor. In an album of lost and mangled love songs, in which relief and fulfillment begin to seem truly impossible (""I can't love nobody unless I'm loving you,"" James announces in the bonus track ""If I Can't Have You,"" a duet she co-wrote with Fuqua), here is a moment of extraordinary deliverance. Finally, James finds her man: a person who doesn't get spooked, doesn't waver, doesn't leave her crumpled somewhere, alone and pining. ""My lonely days are over, and life is like a song,"" she sings, her voice buoyant. The irony – that her own songs, in fact, express considerable pain – is deep and heavy.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a> famously performed ""At Last"" at Barack Obama's first inaugural ball, while he and Michelle shared their first dance. The performance was poignant for obvious reasons—there was, at last, a black president in the White House—but James quickly called bullshit on it (""She ain't mine… I can't stand Beyoncé,"" is how James expressed her annoyance during a Seattle concert, shortly after the ball aired on television). There is a sense, among singers of a certain era—who came of age as performers in a pre-Civil Rights America—of ferociously protecting what they have made or claimed as their own, usually against staggering odds (Aretha Franklin still insists on being paid up-front and in cash, and keeps her purse firmly wedged under her arm as she strolls onstage). </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">James didn't write ""At Last""; it was written in 1941 by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren, for a musical film called </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Orchestra Wives—</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">but she animated it, made it feel real. And there isn't a single moment on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Last!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that doesn't feel unmistakably her own, and forever. </span></p></div>"|21797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21797-at-last/|9.0|Amanda Petrusich

In the early '90s, this untranslatable fury fueled the country's burgeoning black metal scene: a radical, violent offshoot of the misanthropic havoc wreaked abroad by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22972-bathory/"">Bathory</a> and Venom. Trolsk imbued Per Yngve Ohlin, Euronymous and Varg Vikernes with the fierce energy they needed to achieve worldwide acclaim—and notoriety—with their respective bands, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10031-mayhem/"">Mayhem</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11987-burzum/"">Burzum</a>. In time, the same forces would lead to their downfall—and inspire musicians and fans to stab men and set churches ablaze.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In Oslo 1993, away from the spotlight, 17-year-old Kristoffer Rygg (known to most by his nickname, Garm) quietly formed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4414-ulver/"">Ulver</a> with his friends: Sigmund Andreas ""Grellmund"" Løkken (who died the same year), Robin Malmberg, Hävard Jørgensen, Carl-Michael Eide, and Ali Reza. A lifelong disciple of black metal, Garm was as enamored with the necrocosms as anyone else, with some exceptions: while his peers were indulging LaVeyan power-trips, the teenager espoused rebellious romanticism, recasting black metal as a dissonant, gloomy cousin of Norwegian folk music, rather than a form love-letter to Baphomet. They crystallized this vision on their first three albums, which are also their loudest:'<i>95'</i>s <i>Bergtatt – Et Eeventyr I 5 Capitier</i>, '96's <i>Kveldssanger</i>, and '97's <i>Nattens Madrigal-Aatte Hymne Til Ulven I Manden. </i>A trifold rebuttal to black metal formalism, the records presaged the disintegration of heavy music's stylistic boundaries, laying the groundwork for everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31193-windhand/"">Windhand</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30180-horseback/"">Horseback</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30254-drudkh/"">Drudkh</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ulver's debut album <i>Bergtatt – Et Eeventyr I 5 Capitier </i>(typically shortened to <i>Bargtatt</i>) derives both its title and inspiration from a Norwegian folk tale centered around the aforementioned <i>trolsk. </i>Lost in the wilderness and enticed by the mythical creatures lurking in the twilight, the album's female protagonist clambers into the mountains, never to return. Accordingly, <i>Bergtatt's </i>five chapters see Ulver dragging Norwegian folk into the black-metal void. The nearly seven-minute “Capitel II: Soelen gaaer bag Aase need” opens with a graceful flute solo that flits about, only to get snapped up by the blast-beats after the first minute. Garm’s phantom croon drifts in to fill the vacant space, guiding the melody through the web of misery. Just when it seems like a truce has been reached and all's at ease, the frontman flips back to black-metal mode, unleashing more punishing death growls. Ulver are a crafty bunch, but they’re not afraid to flex their muscles once in a while.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Bergtatt</i>'s massive arrangements are majestic on their own, but the album's esteemed reputation is owed to stylistic diversity, rather than pure aggression. Ulver were among the first to integrate folk into the genre's thorny framework, illuminating the pitch-black racket with haunting, clean melodies and acoustic arpeggios. The razed thicket gave outside listeners an access point into a sound that had catered to diehards, breaking open black metal's hostile niche. Simultaneously, the stylistic juggling paved the way for future crossovers by proving that metal bands could expand their stylistic palette without compromising on their abrasive integrity.</p>
<p class=""p3"">A little over a year after <i>Bergtatt </i>made Ulver heroes in their scene, the band torched their laurels on the follow-up <i>Kveldssanger </i>(""Twilight Songs."") The 14-track album does away with the debut's black metal trappings entirely. In other words, it's an entire album of ""Capitel IV""s. Garm's icy tenor has been largely replaced by somber, choral vocals, frequently presented a cappella as if they're sourced from some sacrilegious church service. Unless you're a sucker for medieval chants or Norwegian folkways, you'd be wise to skip over tracks like ""Ord,"" ""A Capella (Sielens Sang),"" and ""Kledt I Nattens Farger"" and stick to the instrumental requiems, which reprise Ulver's mournful, multi-faceted approach to melody. Flutes feature prominently on the hypnotic ""Naturmystikk,"" twirling atop the spindly chords like landing snowflakes; they deepen this wintry mood on ""Hiertets Vee,"" situating the woodwinds within a howling blizzard. Devoid of the guitars' molten heft and the drums' thunderous pulse, <i>Kveldssanger</i> can't capture the heft of the previous album; It's an enjoyable folk record, but ultimately underwhelming. </p>
<p class=""p3"">The band completed their <i>Trilogie </i>in 1997 with <i>Nattens Madrigal-Aate Hymne Tip Ulven I Manden </i>(""Madrigal of the Night – Eight Hymns to the Wolf in Man."") The eight-part record reprises the same hyper-focused approach as its predecessor, but its palette's the polar opposite: a riotous return to black metal, stripped clean of all traces of Ulver's folk favoritism. Once again, the group found their muse in the <i>trolsk</i>: more specifically, its animal emissary, the wolf. ""It [the wolf] indisputably holds a strong position as the Devil's herald in Norwegian myths and conceptions,"" the band revealed in an interview with <i>Slayer</i>. ""[<i>Nattens Madrigal</i>]  glorifies this fiery crossroads and describes both the pain and pleasure by giving in to and recognizing the beast within.""</p>
<p class=""p3"">True to their muse, Ulver frame <i>Nattens Madrigal </i>as a show of musical lycanthropy: not just with regards to its animalistic themes and fanged arrangements, but also its ramshackled, lo-fi production. Fans have come up with some crazy origin stories to explain the record's divergence the from the first two albums' sterling presentation. According to one popular (and sadly, debunked) legend, Ulver recorded the epic in a Norwegian forest on an 8-track recorder after blowing their entire recording budget on drugs, cars and Armani suits. In actuality, the cramped sonics have nothing to due with logistics; rather, the album's compressed presentation is an extension of its return to nature, far from the comforts of a cushy studio.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Inhospitable as their presentation may be, <i>Nattens Madrigal</i>'s eight hymns unfold with the same grace as the first two records, provided that you're willing to dig through the din to uncover that wild beauty. Within the monstrous core of ""Hymne V,"" for example, Jørgensen and Pedersen's guitars weave together subtle harmonies that lend the song's mammoth arrangement some much-needed breathing room. ""Hymne I"" and ""Hymne VII"" are unexpectedly nuanced as well. Even as Garm growls his throat to shreds, barreling down his devolutionary path in time with the blast beats, his bandmates resist the temptation to transgress. Instead, the guitarists' pointed, victorious solos muzzle the feral roar, ensuring that the tug-of-war between man and beast never gets too one-sided. </p>
<p class=""p3"">Ulver left the woods for good following <i>Nattens Madrigal</i>, but their fascination with the arcane has yet to fade in the 19 years since the <i>Trilogie</i>. From industrial reinterpretations of William Blake to sludgy takes on Greek mythology, they've peered into the darkness through every imaginable prism. Listening to January's sophisticated kraut-rock offensive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21456-atgclvlsscap/"">ATGCLVLSSCAP</a>, it's hard to believe that these three albums came from the same band. Certainly Ulver will go down in history for crafting two of black metal's greatest achievements—but it's that unparalleled polymorphism that marvels so many years later. </p></div>"|21762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21762-bergtattkveldssangernattens-madrigal/|8.7|Zoe Camp

The eight-part record reprises the same hyper-focused approach as its predecessor, but its palette's the polar opposite: a riotous return to black metal, stripped clean of all traces of Ulver's folk favoritism. Once again, the group found their muse in the <i>trolsk</i>: more specifically, its animal emissary, the wolf. ""It [the wolf] indisputably holds a strong position as the Devil's herald in Norwegian myths and conceptions,"" the band revealed in an interview with <i>Slayer</i>.

<p class=""p3"">True to their muse, Ulver frame <i>Nattens Madrigal </i>as a show of musical lycanthropy: not just with regards to its animalistic themes and fanged arrangements, but also its ramshackled, lo-fi production.

""Hymne I"" and ""Hymne VII"" are unexpectedly nuanced as well. Even as Garm growls his throat to shreds, barreling down his devolutionary path in time with the blast beats, his bandmates resist the temptation to transgress.

In the early '90s, this untranslatable fury fueled the country's burgeoning black metal scene: a radical, violent offshoot of the misanthropic havoc wreaked abroad by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22972-bathory/"">Bathory</a> and Venom. Trolsk imbued Per Yngve Ohlin, Euronymous and Varg Vikernes with the fierce energy they needed to achieve worldwide acclaim—and notoriety—with their respective bands, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10031-mayhem/"">Mayhem</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11987-burzum/"">Burzum</a>. In time, the same forces would lead to their downfall—and inspire musicians and fans to stab men and set churches ablaze.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In Oslo 1993, away from the spotlight, 17-year-old Kristoffer Rygg (known to most by his nickname, Garm) quietly formed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4414-ulver/"">Ulver</a> with his friends: Sigmund Andreas ""Grellmund"" Løkken (who died the same year), Robin Malmberg, Hävard Jørgensen, Carl-Michael Eide, and Ali Reza. A lifelong disciple of black metal, Garm was as enamored with the necrocosms as anyone else, with some exceptions: while his peers were indulging LaVeyan power-trips, the teenager espoused rebellious romanticism, recasting black metal as a dissonant, gloomy cousin of Norwegian folk music, rather than a form love-letter to Baphomet. They crystallized this vision on their first three albums, which are also their loudest:'<i>95'</i>s <i>Bergtatt – Et Eeventyr I 5 Capitier</i>, '96's <i>Kveldssanger</i>, and '97's <i>Nattens Madrigal-Aatte Hymne Til Ulven I Manden. </i>A trifold rebuttal to black metal formalism, the records presaged the disintegration of heavy music's stylistic boundaries, laying the groundwork for everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31193-windhand/"">Windhand</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30180-horseback/"">Horseback</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30254-drudkh/"">Drudkh</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ulver's debut album <i>Bergtatt – Et Eeventyr I 5 Capitier </i>(typically shortened to <i>Bargtatt</i>) derives both its title and inspiration from a Norwegian folk tale centered around the aforementioned <i>trolsk. </i>Lost in the wilderness and enticed by the mythical creatures lurking in the twilight, the album's female protagonist clambers into the mountains, never to return. Accordingly, <i>Bergtatt's </i>five chapters see Ulver dragging Norwegian folk into the black-metal void. The nearly seven-minute “Capitel II: Soelen gaaer bag Aase need” opens with a graceful flute solo that flits about, only to get snapped up by the blast-beats after the first minute. Garm’s phantom croon drifts in to fill the vacant space, guiding the melody through the web of misery. Just when it seems like a truce has been reached and all's at ease, the frontman flips back to black-metal mode, unleashing more punishing death growls. Ulver are a crafty bunch, but they’re not afraid to flex their muscles once in a while.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Bergtatt</i>'s massive arrangements are majestic on their own, but the album's esteemed reputation is owed to stylistic diversity, rather than pure aggression. Ulver were among the first to integrate folk into the genre's thorny framework, illuminating the pitch-black racket with haunting, clean melodies and acoustic arpeggios. The razed thicket gave outside listeners an access point into a sound that had catered to diehards, breaking open black metal's hostile niche. Simultaneously, the stylistic juggling paved the way for future crossovers by proving that metal bands could expand their stylistic palette without compromising on their abrasive integrity.</p>
<p class=""p3"">A little over a year after <i>Bergtatt </i>made Ulver heroes in their scene, the band torched their laurels on the follow-up <i>Kveldssanger </i>(""Twilight Songs."") The 14-track album does away with the debut's black metal trappings entirely. In other words, it's an entire album of ""Capitel IV""s. Garm's icy tenor has been largely replaced by somber, choral vocals, frequently presented a cappella as if they're sourced from some sacrilegious church service. Unless you're a sucker for medieval chants or Norwegian folkways, you'd be wise to skip over tracks like ""Ord,"" ""A Capella (Sielens Sang),"" and ""Kledt I Nattens Farger"" and stick to the instrumental requiems, which reprise Ulver's mournful, multi-faceted approach to melody. Flutes feature prominently on the hypnotic ""Naturmystikk,"" twirling atop the spindly chords like landing snowflakes; they deepen this wintry mood on ""Hiertets Vee,"" situating the woodwinds within a howling blizzard. Devoid of the guitars' molten heft and the drums' thunderous pulse, <i>Kveldssanger</i> can't capture the heft of the previous album; It's an enjoyable folk record, but ultimately underwhelming. </p>

But this looseness has its limits—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7104-elton-john/"">Elton John</a>’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honky_Ch%C3%A2teau"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Honky Château</i></a> residency notwithstanding, the world is still waiting for its first true glitter-speckled, roots-rock renegade. And though Portland (via Shreveport, Louisiana) maverick <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33578-kyle-craft/"">Kyle Craft</a> doesn’t really tart himself up beyond the occasional silver-hair dye job, his frisky, fantastical debut album, <i>Dolls of Highland</i>, proves the gig is his for the taking. </p>
<p><i>Dolls of Highland</i> is reportedly a break-up album, cobbled from the ashes of a flamed-out eight-year relationship and recorded in a makeshift home studio set up in a friend’s laundry room. But you’d never know about that heart-rending inspiration from the stage-crashing gusto on display here. If <i>Dolls of Highland</i> has a basis in autobiography—the title references the Shreveport neighborhood where it was made—Craft spends the album imagining himself as Ziggy Sawdust, a flamboyant fop working the barrelhouse piano in the front room of the seediest bayou bordello. His songs illustrate how the intense religiosity and voodoo-infused mythology of the South make it fertile turf for the sort of colorful characterization and freak-scenery on which glam rock was founded. This is an album populated by burlesque dancers, bloodsuckers, lonely nightclub singers, goth girls, one-night stands, suicide victims, and otherwise innocent folk going crazy from the heat. Craft summons you into their world like a carnival barker wooing unsuspecting customers into a funhouse attraction.</p>
<p>Like all good Southern boys, Craft grew up in the church before discovering the devil’s music, and he’s prone to casting his songs’ female protagonists as temptresses who can corrupt the most pious of choir boys. There’s the undead damsel of “Eye of a Hurricane” who lures oblivious paramours to their demise with a “kiss down in the catacombs,” and the pole-dancing star of “Berlin” (the stripper’s stage name, not the German city) who renders her most loyal customer a blubbering, blue-balled mess hiding in a rear corner booth. But Craft transcends witchy-woman cliches through both self-deprecating humor and surprisingly sympathetic portrayals—like the vampiric hero of “Jane Beat the Reaper” who wears “medallions on a string, she said they warded off the boredom/ Of life alone and the constant sting of what she was before them.” The further you venture into <i>Dolls of Highland</i>, the more its laundry-room recording locale makes sense: This is an album where dirty souls can go to be cleansed. </p>
<p>Craft is one of those singers who is always <i>on</i>, with a moonstruck howl of a voice that seizes you by the lapels. Its audacity is only amplified by the relatively rustic environs: the beautiful barstool serenade “Balmorhea” could pass for a <i>Bat Out of Hell</i> ballad if Meat Loaf was backed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"">The Band</a>, while the vivacious countrified romp “Future Midcity Massacre” sounds like a Styx from the sticks. His performances are extravagant, but never excessive, using a folk singer’s sepia-toned palette—acoustic guitars, piano, harmonica—to make radiant, rambunctious rock ‘n’ roll, while subtly bending time and space with electrified guitar slides that hearken back to the heartland psychedelia of early-'90s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a>. </p>
<p>But Craft’s outsized personality is matched by less flashy, more fundamental skills: vivid, immersive storytelling and sharply focused, fat-free songs that have the lived-in feel of 40-year-old FM-radio favorites. And he can dial down the irreverence and deliver the drama on more sobering turns like “Trinidad Beach (Before I Ride)” (where Craft forges a spiritual kinship with another southern Anglophilic misfit, the late Chris Bell of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>), and the astounding “Lady of the Ark,” a strummed-out song for a silenced siren that’s launched heavenward atop Spectorized drum crashes and sleigh-bell rattles. “Swing low, sweet heathen/ Swing for the wretch and the rock ‘n’ roll kid,” Craft belts out in the song’s dying moments. “Roam this earth, repeat it/ All this sin until this wicked world makes sense.” Kyle Craft may no longer go to church, but he nonetheless commands a congregation, united in ostracization and a fundamental belief in blasphemy.</p></div>"|21717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21717-dolls-of-highland/|8.1|Stuart Berman

Like his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"">Shins</a>-era peers, Schwartz, who goes by Zach Rogue, was a sensitive songwriter who politely aired grievances with wayward friends, reckless parents, and departed partners in a way that shone a warm light on his personal losses. It was the redemptive aspect that attracted TV music scouts, and the scouts who helped break the band. But after syncs in shows like ""The O.C.,"" the label Sub Pop, who had signed the group after Rogue’s lo-fi solo debut, mysteriously dropped them. A decade later, following increasingly crisp and radio-ready LPs, sixth album <i>Delusions of Grand Fur</i> finds the California band at a crossroads from which every path looks like a cul-de-sac.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rogue, a self-effacing character, would be the first to concede his modest prospects. He’s recently <a href=""http://www.northerntransmissions.com/news/interview-rogue-wave/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">professed</span></a> his newfound obsession with hip-hop and electronic music, lamenting that breakout stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a> are rare beacons at a time when ""[so] many artists rising to the top are garbage."" Where 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13887-permalight/"">Permalight</a> felt like a rudimentary synthpop dalliance, <i>Delusions of Grand Fur</i> is a chance for Rogue Wave to bust open the indie-pop model, inspect the components, and rebuild from scratch. That chance goes untaken and, seemingly, unobserved. The record is chronically mild—it neither pulls off nor attempts songwriting acrobatics. </span><span class=""s1"">Highlights like ""Endless Supply"" and ""Take It Slow"" are pastoral and pretty, vast yet cosy, with a vague sense of battles won. But for all the formula tweaks and threads of political intent—""In the vast expanse of governments/ I think you’re gonna burn,"" Rogue sings, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"">Leonard Cohen</a>-like, on ""Look at Me""—Rogue and Pat Spurgeon have redrafted their gentle-and-epic songwriting orthodoxy, when what it needed was a revolution.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A sign of the record’s impasse is its cover, a defaced, hollow-eyed image by the artist Matthew Craven of Confederate general P. G. T. Beauregard. That a decorated racist seemed fitting art for an otherwise harmless pop record feels instructive: Rogue has thoughtful intentions—his reading concerns white America’s blindness to its past, particularly given the present GOP agenda—but overlooks the possibility that album sleeves simply aren’t the best place to put Confederate generals in 2016. Like the album’s lyrics, it presents a potent idea in a manner just broad and ambiguous enough to ring hollow.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s a shame, because Rogue has a gift for making art of his uncertainties. On 2003’s ""Postage Stamp World,"" he sang, ""You can all get in line/ And lick my behind""—a comically sheepish threat that felt somehow revealing. Now, apprehensive of both world-weariness and quixotic optimism, his songwriting is compromised precisely by its faith in compromise. ""Hey, in the morning/ Can’t get you off my mind,"" goes a typically airy lyric from ""In the Morning,"" a nicely crafted anthem about the trials of marriage. But never does the music submit to raw emotion, relay the breathless rush of dreams chased or the complexities that, in a grim political climate, make retreating into the love of one’s family such a terrifying, guilty temptation. As much as the record flirts with reinvention—personal, political, musical—its modest ambition sounds exactly like complacency.</span></p></div>"|21814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21814-delusions-of-grand-fur/|5.7|Jazz Monroe

In 1996 for </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the New York Times </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stephen Holden wrote that the movie barely kept afloat amidst its conceit of ""hopelessly choppy adventure spoof."" In his over forty-year film career Carpenter has cultivated a reputation that rests on a take-it-or-leave-it attitude to camp glory. Either it touches your or it doesn't. The oodles of corn syrup blood, saccharine thrills, and canned dialogue to some is secretly self aware and to others confoundingly corny. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">His career as a musician is about as long as his film career, having scored almost all of his movies on his own with an admirably spare set up of minimal synths, and he's been widely praised for the sound design of his films. One could make an argument that his ability to foreground scenes with haunting sonics saved otherwise-faltering cinematics. He used repetitive synth notes as dramatic puppet strings, yoking reactions and scary moments for all their worth. He hasn't produced a score that has lived up to this billing since his early- and mid-career work in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Halloween</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Assault on Precinct 13, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">or </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Thing </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(when he went toe-to-toe with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Ennio Morricone</a>, no less)</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lest we forget, he <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTPaAIgwdZc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">split music duties for one of his last scores with Anthrax.</a> But that doesn't discount the fact that film scoring is irrevocably different because of what Carpenter did, and if anything his easily imitable minimalist style is in vogue again.

And outside of film, you can hear the whispers of Carpenter in the work of an artist like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Emerging from the renewed interest, he's begun a late-career revival as a solo musician, and last year released his debut studio album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20091-john-carpenter-lost-themes/"">Lost Themes</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. It was the first time Carpenter made music not directly tied to any visual accompaniment. He said that the process was freeing, and the album was quite good, extracting the best sides of his scores over the years. All that being said, Carpenter is not a man known for his sequels. And his follow up to</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Lost Themes, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the aptly named, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lost Themes </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><i>II</i>, goes to show that some ideas, some sounds, and some themes have legible and reasonable expiration dates. </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Listening to the opening minutes of the album's introduction ""Distant Dream"" you miss the quieter and more restrained aspects of his music making. Brow-beating synth walls and a breathy chorus open the song at backbreaking pace, and then right in the middle you're treated with a drum solo so bombastic that it sounds copy-and-pasted from a Neil Peart practice sessions. And the album never slows down from this opening salvo. The second track ""White Pulse"" starts on a lighter note, and features a chord progressions that would have sounded fantastic in any of Carpenter's films, but quickly descends into a confusing midsong tempo change, filled with fat drum beats, belching pulses, and more choruses. Tracks like ""Dark Blues"" feature frolicking hair metal-style guitar solos. And others like ""Angel's Asylum"" or ""Hofner Dawn"" made me think of light shows at a local planetarium. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Songs in the album's back half, especially the penultimate track ""Utopian Facade"" make the experience worth it. Listening to it, even on a long, mundane bus ride, can make you feel the hero of your own movie. It's the perfect closing credits for the journey of a normal day.

When you learn a bit more about <i>Kind of Blue</i>, you learn that Davis actually envisioned the record with Evans in mind. And though for years Davis was listed as the album's sole composer, Evans wrote ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoPL7BExSQU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blue in Green</a>"" (he eventually received credit.)</p>
<p>Another <i>Kind of Blue</i> piece, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3W_alUuFkA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flamenco Sketches</a>,"" was partly based on Evans' arrangement of ""Some Other Time,"" the Leonard Bernstein standard. (Evans had earlier used the slow opening vamp as a building block to his breathtaking solo piano composition ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv2GgV34qIg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peace Piece</a>""). So though he may not be an especially famous jazz musician, Bill Evans played an integral role in shaping the most famous jazz recording of all time, and the arc of his discography is a rewarding one for those branching off from classic Miles. ""Some Other Time"" continued to be a touchstone piece for Evans for the rest of his life, appearing regularly on his albums (notably on his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBrOkNg2iNI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">duet record with Tony Bennett</a>). And now it's become the title track to a newly unearthed studio album, one recorded in 1968 in Germany but not released until this month.</p>
<p>Jazz in general overflows with archival material. It's a live medium, and recordings of shows have been common since the early part of the last century. Studio LPs could typically be cut in a couple of days, which generally meant a wealth of unused songs and outtakes. But it's somewhat rare to have a true unreleased album—a collection of songs recorded together at a session with the thought of a specific release that never saw the light of day.</p>
<p><i>Some Other Time: The Lost Session From the Black Forest</i> is one of these. It was recorded when Evans was on tour in Europe with a trio that included Eddie Gomez on bass and, on drums, a young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12519-jack-dejohnette/"">Jack DeJohnette</a>, who would go on to much greater fame with Miles Davis, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15745-keith-jarrett/"">Keith Jarrett</a>, and as a leader himself. It was cut between stops on a European tour by German producer Joachim-Ernst Berendt, with the idea that the rights and a release plan would be figured out later. This particular group had only been documented on record just once, on <i>At the Montreux Jazz Festival</i>, recorded five days prior to this date. So the existence of an unheard studio album by the trio is a significant addition to the Evans story.</p>
<p>The piano/bass/drums trio setting is where Evans did his most important and lasting work. He thrived on both the limitations and the possibilities of the set-up, and returned to it constantly over the course of his quarter-century recording career. He generally favored truly collaborative improvising in the setup; the bassist in his trio was expected to contribute melodically and harmonically, in addition to rhythmically, and he could often be heard soloing alongside the pianist. Eddie Gomez, heard on this album, was a steady partner of Evans' for a decade, and the level of empathy between the two players is something to behold. On ""What Kind of Fool Am I?,"" Gomez's dancing lines darts between Evans' bass notes, almost serving as a third hand on the piano. On the immortal title track, Gomez seems like half a conversation, accenting and commenting on Evans' melodic flourishes. For his part, DeJohnette offers tasteful and low-key accompaniment, heavy on the brushwork and soft textures on cymbals—he was more of a role-player at this point in his career. But the three together feel like a true unit.</p>
<p>The tracklist on <i>Some Other Time</i> is heavy on standards, with a few Evans original sprinkled in. To love the American songbook is to be in love with harmony, and Evans never stopped discovering new possibilities in old and frequently played songs. He had a way of phrasing chord progressions for maximum impact, and he used space as virtually another instrument. Evans recorded ""My Funny Valentine"" many times in a number of different arrangements, often uptempo, but here he drags it out into an achingly poignant ballad that picks up speed as it goes. In his autobiography, Miles Davis famously described Evans' tone as sounding like ""like crystal notes or sparkling water cascading down from some clear waterfall,"" and the tumble of notes on the faster sections of ""My Funny Valentine"" evince that crystalline loveliness. In addition to the material planned for the original LP, there's a second LP of outtakes and alternate versions that feels very much on par with the first disc.</p>
<p>Evans' art has endured in part because he has a brilliant combination of formal sophistication and accessibility; critics and his fellow musicians heard the genius in his approach to chords, his lightness of touch, and his open-eared support of others in his band, while listeners could put on his records and simply bask in their beauty, how Evans' continual foregrounding of emotion made the sad songs extra wrenching and the happy ones extra buoyant. He was sometimes criticized for an approach that could sound like ""cocktail piano,"" meaning that it wasn't terribly heavy on dynamics and tended to be lower key and generally pretty, but this turned out to be another strength. If you wanted jazz in the background while engaging in another activity, Evans was your man, and if you wanted to listen closely and hear a standard like ""Some Other Time"" pushed to the limits of expression by his ear for space, he was there for that too.</p>
<p>Evans was one of those jazz artists who changed relatively little over the course of their career. His style developed and his sound had subtle shifts in emphasis over time, but his general approach to music was remarkably consistent, and he remained apart from most of the fashionable trends that wound through the jazz of his era. His first studio date as a leader, in 1956, was just a year after Charlie Parker's death, with bebop very much still au courant; his last, in 1979, the year before his death, was the year Chuck Mangione was nominated for a Grammy for the discofied light jazz funk of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwkwjOd7MCU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feels So Good</a>."" In both of those years, Evans recorded small-group acoustic jazz albums featuring his standard trio, playing a mix of standards and a few originals. About midway between those two bookends came this set, recorded in a small studio in Germany and left on the shelf, and it still sounds fresh and alive almost 50 years later. </p></div>"|21799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21799-some-other-time-the-lost-session-from-the-black-forest/|8.4|Mark Richardson

Quik, the '90s G-funk legend who continues making some of the best music of his career well into his 40s, has been quiet since his last album, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19930-dj-quik-the-midnight-life/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Midnight Life</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, was released in 2014. Over the same time period Problem, a generation younger than Quik but from the same city, has released a handful of mixtapes pining after the commercial peak he reached in 2013 with a single called ""Like Whaaat."" At six songs, the duo's</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> breezes by as a loosely fitting tribute to a shared hometown.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ""Y’all know what Rosecrans is, it’s a long ass avenue that go from the beach to the streets,"" DJ Quik says coolly on the first song, describing the famous Compton throughway that the EP could soundtrack a drive down on a lazy day. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rosecrans </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">was co-produced by Quik and Problem together but it’s the veteran’s genius that shines through in the music. For decades Quik has injected an anything-can-be-funky sensibility into his catalog and into hip-hop more generally, but his legend rests also on an understated musicality that he provides himself and enlists in session instrumentalists. He makes smart music that’s easy to listen to, both clinical and warm at once. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Problem is a practiced and stylish-enough rapper, and he’s noticeably channelled better in short verses here than you’d find on an aimlessly sprawling mixtape. He also seems to have corralled many of the EP’s seven guests. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a> drops in as a mostly forgettable cameo on ""This Is Your Moment,"" which trades the EP’s frequent live bass for a bottom end programmed for the club, alongside a young and far happier-to-be-here Compton rapper named Buddy. The first verse on the album belongs to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"">Game</a>, who has made a career of reminding listeners he’s from Compton and that he knows a bunch of rappers. He does both here with a word-cloud-like verse that checks off self-implicating references to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dre</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>, Bompton, and Chuck Taylor’s. Bad Lucc sneaks in on ""Take It Off One Time,"" a skippable track that sounds like a contemporary-R&amp;B grab Problem brought to the table and Quik tweaked to his liking.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rosecrans</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> features a pair of instrumentalists that also appeared on Quik’s last album and are billed here alongside the man himself as a trio called SuperDave. (They’re all named David.) David Forman’s bass is both fat and nimble on the shimmering opening title track, while David ""Preach"" Balfour finesses his keys into a twinkle on top. David Blake is the obvious coordinator, and he talks his shit instead of rapping it here—not that there’s that much difference—introducing himself as ""the abominable DJ Quik."" Quik has always considered himself a producer first, but as a rapper he’s one of hip-hop’s great acquired tastes, and carries the ability to revolt and charm in a single conversational bar.</span></p>
<p>The EP’s crown jewel comes early with ""A New Nite / Rosecrans Grove,"" which seems to function as a sort of nostalgic retread on one of Quik’s earliest hits, 1991’s ""Tonite."" Vocalist Shy Carter does a bit of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10608-nate-dogg/"">Nate Dogg</a> impression on the hook, but the beauty is in the laid back and eventually rearranged groove. ""Now this the kinda beat that I might need Dre on,"" Quik raps truthfully before promising, ""I’mma stay on."" It’s the blippy, chiptune synth that rises above the fray and catches the ear though. The seemingly out-of-place sound—""Is that my fucking pager going off?"" Problem wonders during the intro—becomes the meandering centerpiece of the track, oscillating from choppily plucked out funk to the sounds you might expect from a prancing Mario as he pockets strings of coins in a hidden level. Later, after more dissection and a vocoder has set the mood, the synth somehow shifts into a wailing police siren with a European accent. The groove never breaks, but the synth throws things off-kilter. It’s another Quik trademark: an unexpected sound twisted to surprisingly versatile depths, the same magic he’s been using to steer his still-winding career.</p></div>"|21840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21840-rosecrans/|6.8|Jay Balfour

This cannot be overstated. Each instrument on <i>Waltzed in from the Rumbling</i> is so exactly in tune and at the optimum volume and placement in the speakers that it feels like each note is tangible. From the chop of the stereo-panned acoustic guitars to the gentle golf claps on last month's single, ""No Worries Gonna Find Us,"" to the train-brakes flute on ""So Many Nights,"" to the string and horn arrangements that bring so much texture to this album, everything is in its right place. If that sounds like I'm referencing a different band, this is because Plants and Animals <i>sound</i> like a different band, namely a combination of turn-of-the-century <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a> and turn-of-the-century <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank"">Flaming Lips</a>.</p>
<p>It's another detour in a career made of them. Over the years, Plants and Animals' disinclination to stick with a signature sound has pretty much become their signature. Their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11201-parc-avenue/"" target=""_blank"">first album</a> favored folk rock arrangements and invited comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/590-blitzen-trapper/"">Blitzen Trapper</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>. Their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14123-la-la-land/"" target=""_blank"">second</a> offered pared-down rock that ignored the precedent set by their debut. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16309-the-end-of-that/"" target=""_blank"">third album</a> was the proverbial “mature” outing. So now, after a four-year absence, Plants and Animals have made a collection of songs that <i>sound</i> gorgeous and will pop up on your Radiohead Pandora station, even though they likely wouldn't even pop up on your Plants and Animals Pandora station.</p>
<p>If the music falls between a soundtrack to dystopia and a technicolor symphony, Spicer's words also fall somewhere between Thom Yorke's sneering cynicism and Wayne Coyne's wide-eyed wonder. Both lyrical ends of the <i><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20010303103405/www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/r/radiohead/ok-computer.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OK</a></i><i> <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070711185350/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/17748-the-soft-bulletin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bulletin</a></i> spectrum—""love is the place that you're drawn to"" on one end and ""when I am king, you will be first against the wall"" on the other—are highly effective, but the area Spicer chooses to inhabit is often a no man's land.  The first words he sings on the album are ""all my time, my friend, I'll spend with you,"" which doesn't sound nearly epic enough for the music he's created with guitarist/bassist Nicolas Basque and drummer Woody Matthew Woodley.</p>
<p>The most rewarding surprises of the album occur when the influences aren't as apparent. The trio brought many guests into Montreal's Mixart Studios for the recording sessions, most notably vocalists Adéle Trottier-Rivard and Katie Moore, who add winning romanticism to the mix. They trade call-and-response vocals on lead single ""Stay"" and sing with Spicer on ""Off the Water"" that they won't always have the chance to ""move with you like water when we dance."" Although all of this is expertly orchestrated, it retains a loose feel, one brimming with the excitement of friends getting back together to collaborate on music again. In doing so, Plants and Animals have created something beautiful, even if it's not wholly original.</p></div>"|21744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21744-plants-and-animals-waltzed-in-from-the-rumbling/|6.8|Pat Healy

As wild and ridiculous as he was, he took his music seriously. He moved away from home when he was 16 and dropped out of high school, meaning most of his considerable free time was spent writing and recording music. He always had several bands going at once; he figured that if he played with each of his bands at least once a month, he’d make enough to get by. He was an excellent guitarist who got really good at recording; his collective discography was massive. It was his living, so the endless touring, huge pile of records, and even the provocations and live show destruction could be seen as business savvy. He played fast, he played loud, and in the early days of YouTube, his every move was documented. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By the time he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/article/7916-jay-reatard-in-memoriam/"">died</a> in early 2010, Jay Reatard had long usurped the Oblivians’ throne and ruled as the undisputed kingpin of Memphis garage rock. (He knew it, too—he quipped that getting thrown out of Gonerfest was like “kicking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1923-jimi-hendrix/"">Jimi Hendrix</a> out of Woodstock.”) He wasn’t just some local figurehead, either—he was the standard bearer for an entire genre. Obviously there were prolific punks before him, but Jay standardized the practice of putting out tons of music under several names in the internet age. He never seemed to oversaturate the market, either, since his audience kept coming back for more. That torch is carried today by guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31942-sick-thoughts/"">Sick Thoughts</a>’ Drew Owen. When Jay’s profile raised after he signed with Matador, he pulled artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28696-hunx-and-his-punx/"">Hunx and His Punx</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28732-nobunny/"">Nobunny</a> into the spotlight with him by bringing them on tour. His absence is jarring, but his influence—both sonically and structurally—is still palpable in garage punk circles. That’s partially due to his work in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29598-the-reatards/"">Reatards</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29732-lost-sounds/"">Lost Sounds</a>, but his best and most powerful full-length work—and the record that made him a standalone rock star—was his first solo album.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blood Visions </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">came together in the aftermath of the Lost Sounds’ dissolution. After Jay broke up with bandmate Alicja Trout, the band fell apart in short order. Their final tour in 2005 ended badly—there was a physical altercation between Jay and Alicja. He was in a ""</span><a href=""https://www.xlr8r.com/features/2008/09/jay-reatard-no-guts-no-glory/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">really, really bad place</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">"" when he temporarily decamped to Atlanta later that year. While staying in an apartment with Alix Brown and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"">Black Lips</a>’ Jared Swilley, he channeled everything into a murderous revenge album. (When </span><a href=""http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/interview/jay-reatard.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">asked</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> if the record was about a particular girl, he revealed, “Yeah, a couple.”) He borrowed Carbonas’ practice space and knocked out most of the songs in one or two takes. Ten years later, the result is still a revelation.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The album is a portrait of a moony-eyed murderer. As a boy, he starts attacking his own family. When he falls in love, he lurks in the shadows and watches her from afar. ""I won't stop until you're dead,/ because of voices in my head,"" he sings on ""Fading All Away."" This is the stuff of horror movies—love that leads to obsession, graduates to stalking, and culminates in murder. It's a narrative framed perfectly by his performance. In ""Death Is Forming,"" as he attempts to veer away from dark thoughts, the words ""death is forming"" rush in at an anxious rapid-fire. With some simple studio work, Jay makes himself the narrator and all the voices in the narrator's head—the tortured and the torturer. He also offsets some of the stalking menace with power-pop riffs and tambourines, which puts ""Nightmares"" in the same tradition as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">Ramones</a>' Nazi love song ""Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World."" Both songs explore the cross-section of good and evil—of love and hate. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To call </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blood Visions</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> a classic isn't just to praise its fucked-up storytelling—it's to celebrate an album stuffed with amazing hooks. The palm-muted chug of ""My Shadow,"" the breakneck backbone of the 56-second highlight ""Greed, Money, Useless Children,"" the loud-to-quiet blues rock stomp of ""Turning Blue""—the album pivots between several rock'n'roll comfort food modes across its 29 minutes. These hooks are punchy and extremely well done—the sort of stuff that sounded incredible when he'd play them live at practically double the recording's speed. And while of course he was an amazing guitarist, his drumming is also essential here. When the instantly recognizable clacking introduction of the title track plays, it's worth noting that Jay was playing that part cold. Drumming is where he'd start—he'd do the percussion in one take and build out the song from there.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aside from some blood-red vinyl, the album's 10th anniversary Record Store Day reissue came with a 7"" featuring four demos: the title track, ""Turning Blue,"" ""It's So Easy,"" and ""Oh, It's Such a Shame."" The bonus record is far from essential, but it's an interesting glimpse into Jay's process. The percussion is thinner, the tempo slower; the main guitar hook is performed on a keyboard, and the words ""blood vision"" are delivered in a demonic bark. Now that he's gone, the urge to collect every single recording he ever made is strong. In this case, the extras feel definitively </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">extra</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: you buy </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blood Visions</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to listen to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blood Visions</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, not the preliminary sketches.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it came time to turn in </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blood Visions</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Jay considered going back to his old routine—forming a new band and releasing those songs under that band’s name. The label convinced him that it should be a solo album. ""This was the first record I made as an adult, when I didn't have to answer to another collaborative member of the band, so it was supposed to be like I was a big fat baby,"" he </span><a href=""http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/interview/jay-reatard.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">said</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of his appearance on the cover. ""Now I finally get to start my life at 24."" It's the perfect illustration to accompany the violent, unsettling birth of a rock'n'roll icon. Even though the guy had already amassed an impressive and sizable discography of wide-eyed rippers, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blood Visions</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> stands as the ideal introduction to Jay Reatard the songwriter, studio perfectionist, character, and (reluctant) star. </span></p></div>"|21714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21714-blood-visions/|9.1|Evan Minsker

Sure, they deployed traditional instrumentation, but their likembés were amplified via car batteries as well as percussion hammered out on scrap metal. The scrappiness and noisiness seemed to situate them along a punk and industrial axis rather than a world music one: Konono No. 1 got compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"">Einstürzende Neubauten</a>, toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1378-the-ex/"">The Ex</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> and recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>. And that was before they found themselves mashed with the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/356-andrew-bird/"">Andrew Bird</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4779-glenn-kotche/"">Glenn Kotche</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27685-micachu/"">Micachu &amp; the Shapes</a> on a peculiar remix <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Various-Tradi-Mods-Vs-Rockers-Alternative-Takes-On-Congotronics/release/2637780"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">set</a>.</p>
<p>So while <i>Konono N°1 Meets Batida</i> might scan as yet another cultural exchange, Konono has actually moved closer to the sound of their home country now. Batida, the alias of Pedro Coquenão, is Angolan-born and Lisbon-based and most sympathetic to the ensemble’s sound, since he does similar work, but updates Angolan music with software rather than metal. In addition to the group, Batida also recruited guitarist Papa Juju, vocalist Selma Uamusse and MC AF Diaphra, though the passing of founder Mingiedi Mawangu no doubt hangs over the group. It's an impressive influx of new talent, but you would be hard-pressed to hear it for most of the album.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Batida’s beats give ""Nlele Kalusimbiko"" a firm foundation, and Diaphra’s verses give the number a velvety growl, before the likembés flare to the fore for the last half of the song. A pitter patter of drum machine opens ""Kuna America,"" which seems rather thin at first. But when the distorted melody buzzes to life nearly two minutes in, the polyrhythms and whistles give the track the feel of a moveable Carnival. The new members tuck into Konono’s sound well enough, but don’t do much to differentiate it from albums past. One might not be able to suss out the collaborative part of the album, mistaking it instead for initiates into the ensemble finding their way. Some of the songs do little more than tread water until the likembés lurch into earshot.</span></p>
<p>For all of the music that the Congolese group has released in the past decade, songs were never really Konono’s forte, so much as building up a headful of steam and letting things careen and rumble as they might. Their finest moments remind me of a ferris wheel gone off its moorings, the likembés making a metallic churning that cycles in ever widening patterns; it's an astonishing sound that both mesmerizes and rolls over everything in its path. So the most effective track here is the eleven minutes of ""Nzonzing Família,"" where it sounds like Batida stands to the side, deftly fills in some of the spaces with small sounds and just allows the group churn towards the horizon. Perhaps that’s Konono’s fate, to always be taking their collaborators for a ride but never getting taken to some new destination.</p></div>"|21696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21696-konono-n1-meets-batida/|6.8|Andy Beta

This is not entirely surprising given that the Brooklyn quartet's members spent their formative years—as both listeners and musicians—knocking around a New York/New Jersey/Long Island scene that ran the gamut from melodic hardcore like Quicksand, Glassjaw, and Vision of Disorder on one end and heavy-as-shit extremity like Human Remains and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1080-the-dillinger-escape-plan/""> The Dillinger Escape Plan</a> on the other. The band's collective resume, in fact, includes not one but two Quicksand spinoff acts (World's Fastest Car and Instruction) as well as groups like Mind Over Matter, Gay for Johnny Depp, and a slew of others. Today, all four members have <a href=""https://youtu.be/7cVN14avUdY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ownership stakes in Brooklyn bars and restaurants</a>, most notably the renowned metal venue Saint Vitus, a hot destination for touring acts.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's this ear to both the local and global pulse that gives<i> The Future of Death</i> a fluidity that's bound to speak to disparate breeds of fans. Dean Baltulonis' recording doesn't hurt either. Where producer Alex Newport emphasized Primitive Weapons' raw brutality on their self-titled EP, Baltulonis (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3780-sick-of-it-all/"">Sick of It All</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"">The Hold Steady</a>) follows guitarist Arty Shepherd's lead in carving out more space for atmosphere and dynamics after the departure of second guitarist Justin Scurti. Together, Shepherd, bassist Eric Odness and drummer Chris Enriquez alternate between doomish menace (the descending, cobra-like riff that drives album opener ""Ashes or Paradise""), straight-ahead pummeling (""Night Eyes""), pressure-cooked brooding (""Whistle Past the Graveyard""), and herky-jerky odd-metered grooves (the verses of ""Old Miami,"" where it feels like the ground is shifting under your feet and you can't quite locate the downbeat to steady your footing).</p>
<p>On ""Panopticon Blues,"" a critique on the loss of privacy in the digital age and perhaps the album's most varied tune, a hi hat/rolling tom tom pattern veers towards a hulking strain of new wave or even disco. About a third of the way through, however, the song launches into a standard mosh breakdown only to then, in another twist, vaporize, leaving room for Shepherd's repeating chant of ""We're watched / We're trapped / We're never alone"" as his spooky background vocals haunt the empty shell that's left of the song by its conclusion. Vocalist David Castillo favors a more traditional death metal bark in the other band he fronts, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33318-white-widows-pact/"">White Widows Pact</a>. But in Primitive Weapons, he channels his lyrical focus into a broader human scope and, as a result, comes across as less irate, a person who prefers to express what bothers him in the form of abstract poetry. ""What I'm asking for is so much more / than another pound of flesh for a song,""<i> </i>Castillo sings on ""Whistle Past the Graveyard."" <i>The Future of Death</i>'s balance between brain, brawn, and heart is so perfectly calibrated that the audience gets more than the usual pound of flesh as well.</p>

On ""Using,"" songwriter Cameron Boucher saves the album’s biggest, grungiest riff for an explosive declaration: ""I stopped wishing I was dead!"" The sentiment is played mostly for celebration, and Boucher shouts it with palpable joy. But it’s also a correction, an indictment of emo’s long history of glorifying depressive thinking, and an implied apology for his complicity in that. In interviews, Boucher explained ""Using"" was the first song he’d ever written with a positive takeaway. Despite his struggles with mental illness, he'd decided to make the best of things. ""I started loving again,"" he sang.  <br/> <br/> How cruel it is, then, that just as Boucher was learning to appreciate his own life, so many of the people close to him were giving up on theirs. Since recording <i>Joy, Departed</i>, Boucher lost some friends to suicide—""a lot of friends,"" he told <a href=""http://americansongwriter.com/2016/04/cameron-boucher-of-sorority-noise/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>American Songwriter</i></a>. Loss on that scale would upend anybody, but it’s especially derailing for an artist who’s had reason to fear he could meet the same fate. In all likelihood he’ll be working through his grief for albums to come, and that long process begins on the home-recorded <i>It Kindly Stopped For Me </i>EP, a four-song cycle narrated from the perspectives of both the departed and those left behind.<br/> <br/> Boucher doesn’t just sound bereaved; he sounds downright shell-shocked. Singing like all the color has been drained from his face, he recites most of the EP in a sickly, half-inaudible mumble. If there are listeners who haven’t checked in on Sorority Noise since their debut LP <i>Forgettable</i>, released only two years ago, they won’t even recognize the band. Boucher’s purged every trace of pop-punk whimsy from his songs, trading crunchy riffs and shout-along tantrums for hushed pianos and closed-mic'ed drums tapped so lightly it’s as if they’re being gently blown on.<br/> <br/> <i>It Kindly Stopped</i> is as intensely somber as its subject matter demands—maybe even more so, if that’s possible—and Boucher often seems to be processing these tragedies in real time. He captured the EP’s most disquieting track, the spoken-word interlude ""Fource,"" while he was literally wandering through the wilderness. ""I think it might be okay, I’ll be okay,"" Boucher mutters unconvincingly into his recorder while trying to catch his breath. ""Today was an off day; I’ve had a few."" If he wasn’t actually drunk when he recorded it, he’s a mighty convincing actor. And while the rest of the EP is more deliberate than that field recording, it’s nearly as lonesome. <br/> <br/> Sonics aside, what truly distinguishes this recent iteration of Sorority Noise is Boucher's newfound sense of responsibility. In concert, he prefaces ""Using"" with a heartfelt introduction about mental illness and the value of life. He includes a similar plea in <i>It Kindly Stopped For Me</i>’s liner notes. ""If you do have the opportunity to listen to this record please know that suicide is not the answer,"" he writes. ""Please know how important you are and how much your life matters to your family, friends, and most importantly yourself."" Yet despite his convictions, he never admonishes the dead in these songs. He sympathizes with them too much for that. On ""Either Way,"" he casts life as a coin toss, drawing a parallel between a friend who saw ""a chance to leave a life you couldn’t lead"" and his own chance ""to rid myself of my toxic ways,"" a chance he could have just as easily missed. That’s the lone consolation on an otherwise disheartening EP, and it’s not an insignificant one: Many of his friends are gone, but Boucher is still here and he's still thankful for that.</p></div>"|21827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21827-it-kindly-stopped-for-me/|6.6|Evan Rytlewski

Between 2010 and 2014, the band’s beloved ""classic"" lineup from the early '90s—the guys responsible for GBV’s best records (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3600-bee-thousand-the-directors-cut/"">Bee Thousand</a></i></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alien Lanes</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, etc.)—returned to release six records, including three in 2012 alone, and play for thousands of enthralled faithful. The albums were only intermittently successful, but it was still a thrill to see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3353-robert-pollard/"">Robert Pollard</a>—the band’s ageless, indefatigable leader, its one constant across decades of lineup changes—scissor-kick his way across the country, a bottle of Jose Cuervo tucked under his arm, while his old buddies wailed away behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now Guided by Voices are back again—or at least the name is. You see, for </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Please Be Honest</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (GBV’s 23rd LP), Bob Pollard wrote every track and played every instrument himself. There is no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3920-tobin-sprout/"">Tobin Sprout</a>, Pollard’s songwriting partner from the classic lineup; no Doug Gillard, Pollard’s guitar-shredding sidekick from the</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">TVT and Matador years; not even Todd Tobias, Pollard’s near constant companion on his endless side projects and solo records. This time the Fading Captain rides alone.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And the results are a decidedly mixed bag. With its slapdash, lo-fi production and jarring transitions from ballad to rocker to quirky one-off, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Please Be Honest </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is a close sonic relative of GBV’s post-2010 discography, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16131-lets-go-eat-the-factory/"">Let’s Go Eat the Factory</a></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">in particular. But this new Pollard-only GBV has less of the easygoing melodicism and sense of goofy fun that kept those records fresh, even at their most awkward moments.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of course, this being Guided by Voices, there are still gems to be found. The stately opener ""My Zodiac Companion"" features one of the more anthemic Pollard choruses in recent memory. The breezy drum-machine jangle of ""Kid on a Ladder"" could fit on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alien Lanes, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">nestled somewhere between ""Game of Pricks"" and ""My Valuable Hunting Knife."" </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The title track serves up the record’s finest melody, sung in Pollard’s bittersweet higher register over nerve-damaged electric guitar. Refreshingly, the song touches on a real-world subject (Pollard’s attempt to get someone to level with him) rather than the usual carnival of GBV absurdities—the ""cucumber guns,"" ""shriveled artichokes,"" and ""glittering parliaments""—that populate the rest of the album.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite its myriad eccentricities, aural and otherwise, GBV is at its core a power-pop band. But great hooks are frustratingly scarce on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Please Be Honest</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, particularly on grinding, midtempo dirges like ""The Grasshopper Eaters,"" ""The Quickers Arrive,"" and ""Nightmare Jamboree."" One really misses Sprout’s songwriting—his emotional candor and vivid harmonies would have helped to brighten what is often a dark, brittle record. And while musicianship is never the point with GBV, many of these tunes, like the lurching, proggy ""Hotel X (Big Soap),"" would have benefited from a bit more finesse. Too many of the drum and guitar tracks sound like they’re being played with a hammer.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ultimately, however, the biggest problem with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Please Be Honest </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is existential: The fact that it’s a Guided by Voices record at all seems entirely arbitrary. It could just as easily have been a Pollard solo album or a new record from Teenage Guitar (Bob’s other solo project) or the debut album from some other dreamed-up band (like, say, Kitchen Winners, Jet Logic, or the Easy Cyclists). Pollard seems simply to have finished a new batch of songs and decided they sounded like a Guided by Voices record—a strikingly anti-climatic backstory for the return of such a legendary act. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Without a solid band identity and the sense of mission it provides, this new GBV comes off like little more than a side project, like just another star in the greater constellation of Bob (and not even the brightest one, considering the quality of Pollard’s recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32728-ricked-wicky/"">Ricked Wicky</a> records with guitarist Nick Mitchell). <i>Please Be Honest</i> certainly has its charms. But for the first time in Pollard’s career, Guided by Voices isn’t the main event—which, for the band’s legions of fans, is surely a loss.</span></p></div>"|21808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21808-please-be-honest/|5.9|John S.W.

Our understanding of the singer, cellist, producer, and composer's artistic identity, then, continues to evolve, as lost or cobbled-together releases trickle out via the Russell archival label Audika Records. Among the different versions of Russell, the eccentric disco obsessive and the confessional singer/songwriter remain his most familiar modes. The aspiring avant-garde classical music composer is less known, with the least recorded music to show for himself.</p>
<p>Yet Russell spent years of his life absorbed in this scene. During his composition studies at the Manhattan School of Music and Dartmouth University, he found inspiration in the work of the previous generation of downtown New York avant-garde composers—studying the early minimalist music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"">La Monte Young</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>, and the spare, pacifying orchestral works of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1473-morton-feldman/"">Morton Feldman</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"">John Cage</a>, and one of his teachers, Christian Wolff. In works like his 48-hour-long experiment <i>Instrumentals</i>, he blended rock'n'roll influences with modern classical methodology. But the newly rereleased <i>Tower of Meaning</i> recordings capture a set of incidental theater music that bears an even clearer mark of those influences. Eschewing the pulsating, pop-influenced underpinnings of almost all of his other work, <i>Tower of Meaning</i> is the greatest outlier in his Russell's recorded catalogue: the most uncharacteristic one-off project in a career that is full of them.</p>
<p>And like many of Russell's creative ventures, there were other famous figures tangentially involved with this project. The pieces included on <i>Tower of Meaning</i> were written for a production of Euripides' <i>Medea</i> by legendary opera and theater director Robert Wilson in the early '80s. The collaboration was facilitated by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>, who worked with Wilson on seminal avant-music-theater work <i>Einstein on the Beach</i> in 1976. A fight between Wilson and Russell resulted in the music being axed from the program, and it went unheard until Glass released the tapes on his own Chatham Square label—in a run of 320—some years later. Ironically, outside of his landmark cello-and-vocal release, 1986's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6909-world-of-echo/"" target=""_blank"">World of Echo</a><i>, </i><i>Tower of Meaning</i> was the only finished and properly pressed ""Arthur Russell"" album during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Devoid of its dramatic context, and peppered with abrupt track ends that suggest lost tape reels, this music feels more in-process than many of Russell's ""unfinished"" music does—a skeleton to be filled in. Each of the seven tracks consist mostly of long, repeating strings of block chords, voiced by mixed string, wind, and brass ensembles. In later movements, a harp and hand drum, respectively, provide decoration in between the chords, perhaps suggesting the court music of the play's time period. Some of the harmonies have a brittle, dissonant quality; others feel open and cavernous; a few feel a couple of ticks away from pop music. The three types are mixed up thoroughly in these pieces, and it takes a while to become acclimated to this fidgety vocabulary.</p>
<p>But the most notable and challenging thing about the pieces on <i>Tower of Meaning</i> is their lack of arc or climax. Russell's misty but urgent song accompaniments have a similarly static quality, accumulating mass gradually and never drastically. But <i>Tower of Meaning</i> takes a very different approach to achieving a similar effect. The chords move in no consistent meter; there is almost no variation of dynamic across the album, and the chamber orchestra is stark and untreated with effects. Over time—consistent with most of Russell's work—this begins to create a pleasant, soothing effect, despite the sometimes-jarring nature of the harmony.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the approach finds overlap with that of ambient music. A few years prior to writing the <i>Medea</i> score, while at the Manhattan School, Russell told a skeptical composition teacher that he liked writing pieces that the listener could ""plug out [from] and then plug back in[to] again without losing anything essential."" On <i>Tower of Meaning</i>, it's easiest to do this during the culminating piece of the album, ""Fragments From Tower of Meaning,"" which assembles chordal ideas from earlier tracks into a cyclical chamber orchestra piece, punctuated by a Pavlovian chime, which becomes more warm and enveloping across its 21-minute duration.</p>
<p>It would be tough to claim that <i>Tower of Meaning</i> is one of Russell's greatest efforts. Then again, it was not designed to be: It sounds very much like it was written as a functional component of Wilson's larger picture, not to be disseminated separately. Also, it has more of a clear grounding in a pre-existing musical lineage than anything else that Russell ever released. Yet <i>Tower of Meaning</i> works well within its own self-imposed boundaries. It has definite jolts of Russell's playful, try-anything-once mentality. Like most of his best music, it manages to position itself just slightly outside of convention, at a jaunty angle.</p></div>"|21807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21807-tower-of-meaning/|7.0|Winston Cook-Wilson

You feel the overload in the album’s selection of palatial synths, bubbling percussion, sugary bass lines. And the threat of melt is in Norton’s voice and drawn out intonation, which hangs like a diffuse cloud of dry ice around the soupy mixture of sounds. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This effect is best achieved in songs like ""Real Good Day"" and the album’s centerpiece, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18119-cellars-still-in-love/"">Still in Love</a>."" In ""Real Good Day"" twinkling arpeggios and a cooing chorus carry Norton’s voice down the PCH<b> </b>like a convertible driving towards the sunset.  </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even if never stated explicitly, the album as a whole is rather optimistic. It comes from what is at times a goofy erotic sheen, indebted to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a> or YMO.  </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Phases </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">might be the only the album this year to capture camp in all its classic glory: Even the missed beats have a kernel of fun and whimsy, like a teen movie montage. The sounds they have made and the emotions they've referenced here are always in the back of your mind, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">on the tip of your tongue, never new or old, just pure plastic.</span></p></div>"|21792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21792-phases/|7.0|Kevin Lozano

The German electronic musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7523-lawrence/"">Lawrence</a>, aka Peter Kersten, makes house music that's as much about getting lost in one's head as being enfolded by the crowd. And while Kersten rarely strays too far from dancefloor-oriented forms, his work has spent the past several years getting steadily dreamier.</p>
<p>Kersten is a key figure in German house and techno, having co-founded Hamburg's Dial label in 2000 and then, in 2006, the deeper-diving <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/925-10-crucial-tracks-from-smallville-germanys-coolest-little-label/"">Smallville</a>. Early Dial pursued a streamlined take on house music that, combined with the whittled-down sounds of early-'00s digital production, led to its characterization, not always accurately, as a minimalist enterprise. But the label never relinquished its fondness for the skippy rhythms and soulful undercurrent of Chicago house, and it went in hard for a strain of windswept romanticism that was easily apparent in both the label's sleeves and its titles. (From Lawrence's own catalog, just consider bittersweet songs like ""Happy Sometimes,"" ""The Night Will Last Forever,"" and the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuWZEhbe8x8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smiths-referencing</a> ""Fifteen Minutes With You."") Smallville, meanwhile, has represented a distillation of those tendencies, resulting in a hyper-classicist style of house, heavy on all the analog signatures of pioneers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13181-larry-heard/"">Larry Heard</a>, that's also wistfully misty-eyed. Throughout, Lawrence's recordings—including his albums for Japan's Mule Musiq label, of which <i>Yoyogi Park </i>is the third—have served as a kind of ur-text for the Smallville aesthetic.</p>
<p>His ambient inclinations peaked with 2014's <i>A Day in the Life</i>, a collection of songs that took all his typical hallmarks—the shimmer, the swirl, the open-ended tones—and muted all the drums. The result, delicate and ephemeral, was something like the logical conclusion of his most sensitive tendencies: music for Sunday-morning snuggling, walks in the garden, and gentle comedowns, with the merest memory of the dancefloor traced in the shadow of a pulse. <i>Yoyogi Park </i>starts where <i>A Day in the Life </i>left off. It's suffused in hazy synthesizers, sparkling arpeggios, and melodic lines that twist like green tendrils. But in places <i>Yoyogi Park</i> also marks Lawrence's wholehearted return to the dancefloor. Nowhere is that more apparent than on the three songs that have been reprised—upcycled, really—from the previous album, doubled in length and given a whole new rhythmic underpinning. Where the original version of ""Nowhere Is a Place"" drifted like a kelp forest, the new one leaps purposefully into motion, driven by tightly wound hi-hats and a walking bassline that's unusually fleet of foot. Flickering chords lend additional color and movement, and the result sounds a little like an updated version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"">Ricardo Villalobos</a>' great ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7moGwGdfdE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">808 the Bassqueen</a>,"" but even <i>more </i>full-bodied, if you can believe it. This is not an album for sitting still: ""Marble Star"" fleshes out its ultra-low lows and ultra-dreamy highs with rugged, rolling breakbeats, and ""Blue Mountain"" rides white-capped waves of synths and drums that bob like flotsam borne aloft on the tide.</p>
<p>One of Kersten's favorite tricks is to juggle soft and hard textures until you're not sure which is which. ""Tensui"" starts off with knife-edged hi-hats and tough wooden thumps, but it's soon suffused in drowsy pads and bucolic flutes. It would be easy to imagine the same elements remade for <i>A Day in the Life</i>'s beatless reveries; the fact that he manages to marry such diffuse sounds to a rhythm track so overwhelmingly physical—this isn't bass you simply feel; you savor it, with your whole body—only makes the track more remarkable. Nothing on <i>Yoyogi Park</i> is original, exactly; Lawrence has been making music like this for most of his career, and his peers on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14861-glass-eights/"">Dial</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21493-a-minor-thought/"">Smallville</a> have spun the same material in similar ways. Still, no one else is making this music quite so well. And as far as Lawrence's catalog goes, this is his fullest realization yet of interior and exterior—of thought and movement, of daydream and dance. The line separating Saturday night and Sunday morning is no thicker than a second hand; <i>Yoyogi Park</i> invites you to clear out a space inside that sliver of time, and to luxuriate in it.</p></div>"|21695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21695-yoyogi-park/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

His legacy means many different things to hip-hop fans; he brought <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10146-the-pharcyde/"">Pharcyde</a> (and much of hip-hop) into adulthood on Pharcyde's 1995 album </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">LabCabinCalifornia, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">placing warm and sunny beats under the L.A. quartet's disillusioned musings on identity, purpose, and struggles against commerce. He supported <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1028-de-la-soul/"">De La Soul</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as they directly campaigned against rap's material excess on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stakes Is High</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. He collaborated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"">Q-Tip </a>on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6195-a-tribe-called-quest/"">A Tribe Called Quest</a>'s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beats, Rhymes &amp; Life</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> at the exact moment that the group's personal expansion and internal tension began to forecast their end. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These are the formative years, a pivotal part of  the origin story that places him in the pantheon. But the tale behind</span></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Diary</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> twists the narrative. It goes back to at least 2002, years after Dilla had contributed to the then-flowering neo-soul movement by bringing a softened low end and melodic, hazy middles to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"">Erykah Badu</a>'s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mama's Gun</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"">D'Angelo</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/"">Voodoo</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Along with his continued work with Tribe, his efforts on Q-Tip's Amplified</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as well <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"">Common</a>'s <i>Like Water for Chocolate</i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and <i>Electric Circus</i></span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dilla provided a safe space for forward thinking hip-hop and smart R&amp;B to meet on their own terms and grow beyond the sum of their parts.  At a time when hip-hop and and R&amp;B pairings were still being done as mash-ups that simply dropped a dollop of peanut butter into a chocolate cup, Dilla was experimenting with new flavors and cutting-edge swirls of tastes. It was all prescient and revolutionary and it's exactly why MCA, his then-record label shelved his solo debut </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pay Jay</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the album that has been dusted off and presented to us almost a decade and a half later as </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Diary</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dilla's most noted collaborators had been progressive, socially conscious writers who waxed about the big ideas about their immediate society in grand terms. But precious little of that sentiment was to be found in his own raps. As a producer, he was thoughtful and intimate; as a rapper he was brash, confrontational, and unrepentantly materialistic and misogynist. Nary a song on this project goes by without either a mention of wealth, an intimation of violence, or a dismissal of women. And sometimes he manages all three with neck-breaking economy. ""The Shining, Pt. 2 (Ice)"" is barely over one minute long but still manages to house uncomfortable lyrics like, ""Jay been nice with his since Dre said he was a n-gga for life/ And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks—that's what I'm thinking when I'm dickin' your wife/ Yup/ Big truck jewels in the truck with tools/ You don't want to pop shit tonight."" On ""The Creep (The O)"" Dilla paints himself as a serial womanizer and incorrigible cuckolder. ""You could stay out with Craig and them,"" he raps to the listener, personified as a man whose woman he's cheating with. ""Mo' time for me to bang out/ Shit, I love when you hang out/ It's nothing else to do but send her home to you/ I'm through, 'til the next time we screw."" The latter couplets are repurposed from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">Notorious B.I.G.</a>, but the sentiment is all Dilla. As far as hip-hop trespasses go, it's quotidian by early-'00s standards, and tame by current ones. But it's obviously not what label execs expected or wanted from the guy who produced songs like Common's ""Between Me, You &amp; Liberation"" and Erykah's ""Kiss Me on My Neck (Hesi).""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite being intended as Dilla's first true solo album, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Diary </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is not what people who are seeking an entry point should gravitate to. For that, listeners are better directed towards the upcoming collection, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Fantastic Box: A Jay Dee Production </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">in order to get a concise overview of his themes and sounds; or directly to his magnum opus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4365-donuts/"">Donuts</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the last album released in his lifetime, which shows him at the height of his production mastery. In many senses, it's hard to understand who this record is directed towards. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Diary</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> was released in conjunction with Record Store Day, an obvious move at collectors and archivists. But a quarter of these songs have already been released in some form; and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pay Jay</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> has already</span><a href=""https://www.discogs.com/J-Dilla-Pay-Jay/release/1611394"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">widely circulated in bootleg form</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. <i>The Diary</i> comes off as a play for completists that was prefaced with</span><a href=""https://www.acehotel.com/calendar/london/j-dilla-the-diary"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> a listening party at a trendy hotel</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and</span><a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/i-ate-14-course-meal-inspired-j-dillas-long-lost-album-diary-447957"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a gastronomic orgy in New York</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">—events for the committed and connected, not the everyman. It’s an over-reaching approach that attempts to make a blockbuster out of what should be an arthouse film.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The bookends of the album—the cinematic intro, the proclamations, the heavy-handed ad-libs on the closing track—are conceits that try hard to position <i>The Diary</i> as an </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">important</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> record, but they're unnecessary. The tracks—namely Supa Dave West's ""So Far,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4971-hi-tek/"">Hi-Tek</a>'s ""The Creep (The O),"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30846-karriem-riggins/"">Karriem Riggins</a>' ""Drive Me Wild""—are playfully bouncy enough to get  heads bopping, shoulders bouncing, and hips grooving while still smart enough to be cerebrally rewarding to beat nerds. They're all incredibly short, as well. Like most numbers here, they clock in at under three minutes, all but begging for expanded editions masterminded by Dilla collaborators and devotees like, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>, and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/""> Flying Lotus</a>. (Seriously and please.)  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are still moments, like the touchingly personal title track, where we are reminded Dilla was a beast of an MC when he wanted to be. On ""The Shining, Pt. 1 (Diamonds),"" Dilla lights up like a late-90's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay Z</a>. An obvious take on Jay's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6NEgBNhFh4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Girl's Best Friend</a>,"" it's a song-long metaphor as love song to bling and plays like Dilla's radio concession. But Dilla may as well have been prophesying his legacy:  ""You so special, you multifaceted/ You can cut glass with it/ It's so brilliant /Go spend a little dough, look like you sold millions/ Plus you everlastin'/ And drastically important when sportin' your ghetto fashion."" That was Dilla—multifaceted and brilliant—and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Diary</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is notable for presenting an official release to his intended debut. And, just like any diamond unearthed after many years, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Diary</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is flawed, but still precious. </span></p></div>"|21709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21709-the-diary/|6.9|kris ex

The things that make it seem superficial also make it seem happy and industrious, a place where people are always freewheeling from one rad thing to the next. Los Angeles challenges you to take it seriously and wonders—in wounded earnestness—why you can't. It is one of the least believable places I've ever been and a place I consequently never want to leave. </p>
<p><i>Flutes, Echoes, It's All Happening!, </i>by Carlos Niño &amp; Friends, is a very Los Angeles album. Niño is a hub of the city's musical subculture, one of those people whose primary contribution seems to be his ability to connect other people. Over the past 20 years, he has hosted three radio shows and worked on over 50 albums, charting an invisible continent where hippy jazz meets new age music and underground hip-hop meets airy, Laurel Canyon-style folk. (Lately his shows have been focused on the perennially great Dublab.) Along with the vocalist Dwight Trible, he leads a big band called Build an Ark, whose loose, ever-shifting roster of players—inspired by groups like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32455-sun-ra-and-his-arkestra/"">Sun Ra Arkestra</a>—turns the model of the 1930s jazz orchestra into a metaphor for equality and collectivity. He has helped arrange the music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a> for chamber orchestra and participated in an album-length tribute to tea. Though many of the projects he's worked on credit him as an artist, I'm still not sure what he plays. At the time of writing, he is 39.</p>
<p><i>Flutes</i> is the fourth of Niño's ""and friends"" series. Pieced together using fragments and sketches Niño had worked on over the past few years, it's a loose, comfortable and often deliberately comforting experience, the kind of music that makes room for the listener rather than reaching out to be heard. As with Niño's other archive-related releases, the range is wide but the journey is easy. “Metamaravilla,"" with its bird sounds and untamed cascades of violin, follows a line from the impressionism of Debussy and Ravel through to the postwar exotica of Les Baxter, music designed to transform familiar rooms into wilds of which the listener had only dreamed. ""Alice's Chord"" is presumably a reference to the pianist, harpist and composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5881-alice-coltrane/"">Alice Coltrane</a>, whose loose rhapsodies turned jazz into a metaphor for inner space. (Her husband, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"">John</a>, hovers over the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32915-kamasi-washington/"">Kamasi Washington</a>–featuring “Joyous Gratitude,"" as does his collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13692-pharoah-sanders/"">Pharoah Sanders</a>). You can see why guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> belong here, and where Niño's interest in hip-hop stems from in general: Not as a party-ready extension of funk and disco, but as music that uses groove and repetition as a way to leverage meditative states. </p>
<p>Like any good curator, Niño is proposing an alternative history, one where the sound of a style isn't as important as the spirit behind it, where black and white have more in common than they might otherwise realize, where you can hear the new-age pioneer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31452-iasos/"">Iasos</a> digress about the benefits of hanging out near waterfalls alongside a little free jazz. (Negative ions. It's negative ions.) In that sense, the diversity of <i>Flutes </i>often ends up being more interesting than the material itself. I like it best when I listen to it less as music than as a blueprint to how music might be made, a map of Niño's place in the universe. “I don't feel like I'm a citizen of the United States,"" he told the <i>L.A. Weekly</i> in 2009. “But I do relate to California."" California seems to relate back.</p></div>"|21778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21778-flutes-echoes-its-all-happening/|6.8|Mike Powell

In his introduction to the liner notes for this 4-disc box, former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2057-lee-ranaldo/"">Lee Ranaldo</a> references a widely circulated group photo of Bowles along with William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and others taken on the patio of the Villa Muniria hotel in Tangier. Of course, the North African desert would become almost synonymous with Bowles' storied career. But for him, Morocco was also the place he would call home for the rest of his life. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Long considered a 20th-century literary giant, Bowles actually pursued a career in composition prior to (and even after) the success of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Sheltering Sky, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">which was h</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is first novel. Bowles, in fact, visited Morocco for the first time in 1931 on a trip with Aaron Copland, under whom he was studying composition at the time. And though he changed lanes professionally, Bowles continued to nurture a profound interest in music, which is made abundantly clear by this set. Of course, the author occupies a central role here, having recorded all four discs himself over a six-month period in 1959 during which he criss-crossed Morocco, but thankfully he keeps his focus trained strictly on the music and the cultural currents from which it emerged. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""For years, I composed music,"" Bowles can be heard saying at the beginning of the 1993 documentary</span><i><a href=""https://youtu.be/2_SDL9Mf4Ks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Un Américain à Tanger</span></a></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. ""Then, suddenly, I decided to write books instead... There’s nothing to say about either the music or the books. I hate talking about myself. I’ve got nothing to say."" In another documentary, 1998’s </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let It Come Down: The Life of Paul Bowles</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the author</span><a href=""https://youtu.be/5N1uC62NEJg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">says</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, ""There was no violence in my life ever—maybe that’s why I gave up writing music.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Maybe so, but on </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Music of Morocco</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> he has plenty to say. True to his word, though, he says almost nothing about himself</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Though his voluminous notes, reprinted here from his own journal, do at times provide first-person accounts of his travels, they do so only to serve a better understanding of what you’re hearing. In fact, ""understanding"" might be an understatement. The thoroughness of Bowles’ ethnomusicological narration (not to mention the way project producer Philip D. Schuyler organizes and adds to that narration) more or less gives listeners a crash course in the social, historical, and musical basis for four-and-a-half-hours’ worth of music. </span></p>

Bowles separated the music into two major categories: the music of North Africa’s Berber people on one LP and Arab- and Sub-Saharan-influenced music on another. Schuyler, an ethnomusicologist on faculty at the University of Washington, explains that Bowles regarded Berber music and culture as reflective of the ""real"" Morocco </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">thought of the Arabic influence as an invasive ""contagion.""   </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Schuyler’s new track sequence remains faithful to Bowles’ delineation between those two musical strains, but he does point out that the Arab influence had been steeping in Morocco for a thousand years by the time Bowles arrived. (Schuyler got to consult with Bowles on the project before the author’s death in 1999.) And while it’s certainly not necessary to approach the liner notes as a textbook in order to enjoy the music, the uninitiated will undoubtedly have trouble distinguishing between sounds that Bowles had learned to tell apart. On the other hand, the running order at first comes across as disparate and somewhat disconnected—as if playback had been a secondary consideration.   </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But the </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">musical </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">variety proves to be an asset in the long run. You may not initially be able place the various rhythmic and harmonic modes that bob and weave in </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">what at first seems like one </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">giant pool of music. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">B</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ut the more you listen, the more </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">you can discern how the various motifs</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> inter-relate and complement one another. After a while, as you get acclimated and your hearing comes into better focus, the entire 4xCD swath starts to play less like a </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">haphazard </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">gumbo of sounds and more like a series of carefully laid-out fabrics.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regardless, it requires zero background info to be struck right away by three key aspects: repetition, cadence, and the fluidity of North African melodic scales. Bowles and Schuyler expound at great length on all the above, but suffice it to say that much of this music induces a powerful hypnotic effect. In the 1970 documentary </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Paul Bowles in Morocco</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the author</span><a href=""https://youtu.be/6UQa1K0lwys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">recalls</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> how he once saw a man walk into a Moroccan café where a group of musicians were playing. As the man grew more entranced by the music, he started to slash his own arms and legs with a knife—in rhythm as the musicians kept playing. While that’s certainly on the extreme end, it’s a good illustration of how transportive this music can be—not unlike the way American gospel or Haitian ceremonial music can move people into altered states.   </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of course, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Music of Morocco</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> offers a deeply satisfying experience even if you don’t get that carried away. For some perspective: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1923-jimi-hendrix/"">Jimi Hendrix</a> significantly enriched their work when they trained their sights on North Africa, but their exposure was limited. When Bowles</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> put his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12816-alan-lomax/"">Alan Lomax</a> hat on and made these tapes, he had lived in the country for well over a decade. Unfamiliar listeners will no doubt find the flow of this music alien, its meter unfolding in seemingly lopsided patterns the way </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">separate sets of </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">wooden chimes clatter randomly as the wind strikes them. But the form in that clatter becomes evident </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">over time</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Moreover, Bowles’ attention to detail shows that he didn’t just regard this stuff as brightly-colored wallpaper or background scenery, but as the living, breathing pulse of </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the place he chose to call </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">home.  When approaching this box, it pays to ditch your notions of how glamorous it was for emotionally desiccated, self-destructive figures like </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">William </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Burroughs and </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">Rolling Stones</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> guitarist Brian Jones to feed their habits in an ""exotic"" locale, the allure of the North African desert a mere backdrop in the arc of their crash-and-burn stories. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unlike his peers, Paul </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bowles </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">wasn’t content to just </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">disappear into a cloud of hash smoke</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And so it makes sense that </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Music of Morocco</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is such an eye-opening, immersive document, the kind we’d expect from someone who’s spent time in a country getting to know its way of life but who could still make </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">observations (or simply observe)</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as a guest. And if you’re a fan of Bowles’ novels, don’t expect the indulgent prose that’s all too typical of writers who can’t help but phrase everything as if they were reading aloud in front of an audience. Thankfully, as Schuyler explains, Bowles—a college dropout—didn’t identify as an academic, so he doesn’t come off as pedantic either. (One of the CD sleeves describes his writing as ""spare, precise, and carefully assembled."") Because he didn’t lay it on thick in his journal, and because Schuyler refrains from fawning, the faux-leather, 120-page book that comes with this box actually works as standalone reading material that you</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">'d</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> want to keep at your bedside table or pack in your travel bag.</span></p>
<p>For a record label that’s built its reputation in large part on top-notch presentation standards, Dust-To-Digital, along with Rounder Records’ Bill Nowlin, have outdone themselves this time with a breathtaking package and sleek art direction courtesy of Barbara Bersche. If either you’ve lost sight of or continue to lament the disappearance of the physical object in recorded music, you couldn’t dream of a better reminder than this set. Words just don’t do justice to how it feels holding <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Music of Morocco</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in your hands, or to its stately elegance sitting on your shelf. And if you’re looking for an entry point into the soul of a people via its music, you simply can’t do better than </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Music of Morocco</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.

This is one of the reasons <a href=""http://www.beatsinspace.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beats in Space</a>'s Tim Sweeney is a comforting presence: In addition to being one of New York's best DJs and longest-tenured tastemakers, he comes off on his weekly WNYU radio show—broadcast every Tuesday night at 10:30pm since he walked in as a student in 1999, and <a href=""http://www.beatsinspace.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">meticulously archived</a> on his website—like, well, a bit of a dork. His casual demeanor and idiosyncratic interview style, in addition to his musical curiosity, lends his show an irrepressible friendliness that is unusual in dance music culture.</p>
<p>It's a vibe that has carried over to his record label of the same name, under which he's released 20 records—mostly 12""s but also a couple of albums—since 2011. Sweeney's tastes run wide and deep, and he's been in on the ground floor of every important trend in underground dance music during the last 15 years (he notably interned for DFA and has regularly DJ'ed with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5462-james-murphy/"">James Murphy</a>). He's kept his label stylistically diverse but with a few common threads: groovy, lightly psychedelic tracks that might sound best at a deck party, or the beach. Balearic would be a good catchall, though Sweeney's choices represent a very New York iteration—basically disco and its stepchildren—that includes various shades of electro, italo, house, and punky funk.</p>
<p><i>BIS: 001 - 020</i> collects a track from each of the label's releases offering an easy, if slightly daunting (there's nearly 150 minutes of music here) overview of the label. The collection doesn't offer any household names; certainly given his connections and status Sweeney could've recruited higher profile producers. What's on offer here is really Sweeney's vision, the humid urban tropics his selections conjure.</p>
<p>In practice this is everything from the bratty guitar stomp of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32092-hidden-fees/"">Hidden Fees</a>' ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16648-hidden-fees-so-what/"">So What</a>""—as fine a replica of mid-2000s DFA clamor on offer in 2016—to the sprawling acid bass of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28805-secret-circuit/"">Secret Circuit</a>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14852-secret-circuit-afterlife/"">Afterlife</a>."" <i>BIS: 001 - 020</i> doesn't offer a discernible flow or progression; it's a great record to jump in and out of, or to set to random and cook dinner to. Many of the tracks contain the kind of charming off-key vocals that helped differentiate, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13361-ze-30-ze-records-story-1979-2009/"">Ze Records</a> disco tracks from gaudier major label productions. The compilation's more traditional dance tracks—Matt Karmil's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>-ish ""So You Say"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31671-crystal-s-koshi/"">Crystal &amp; S. Koshi</a>'s roiling ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15980-crystal-s-koshi-break-the-dawn/"">Break the Dawn</a>""—offer chopped vocals, never straying far from an easy tunefulness.</p>
<p><i>BIS: 001 - 020</i> is never less than good, but it also falls somewhat short of essential. Labels like International Feel and Permanent Vacation have offered similar thrills for years. It's possible to parse out the peculiarities of Sweeney's taste but there's a certain irony in appreciating Sweeney on a granular level. What has made his radio show so special is that there is no one easy summation of it; its value increases as you return week after week (or archived stream after archived stream), listening to an ever widening variety of DJs and styles. Beats in Space the radio show remains an essential resource for fans of dance music; Beats in Space the label is a fun, friendly capsule of Sweeney's favored style.</p></div>"|21809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21809-bis-001-020/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

Its perspective was so refreshing that other like-minded albums came to be: Chris Stapleton enlisted <i>Metamodern</i> producer Dave Cobb to craft his own revivalist release <i>Traveller</i>, which won the 2016 Grammy for Best Country Album. While <i>Metamodern Sounds of Country Musi</i>c is certainly a record that invited imitation, it's darker and deeper than Stapleton's award winner or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5343-jason-isbell/"">Jason Isbell</a>'s most lauded recent solo albums (also produced by Cobb), a sometimes-nihilistic opus that proclaims things like “Ain't no point of getting out of bed if you ain't livin' the dream"" and declares hallucinogens like DMT as lenses with which to see the truths of existence. The combination of the vintage music and the album's contemporary subject matter made for one of the most memorable releases of the last five years.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While Simpson could have easily milked a few records out of that glum sound and guaranteed industry adulations for decades, <i>A Sailor's Guide to Earth</i> represents a startling change in tone and presents a wealth of rewards for every creative risk. Instead of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWx6csgGkg4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">counting turtles</a> and finding a voice in classic country—Simpson himself smirks at the notion that he is a modern Waylon Jennings, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/arts/music/sturgill-simpson-a-genuine-alternative-to-alt-country.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">because he doesn't listen to Waylon Jennings' music</a>, though the connection is by no means inaccurate—Simpson is doing something far more difficult. Embarking on song cycle that draw upon sounds and songwriting styles that aren't found on his first two records at all, Simpson draws from his time in the Navy, where he was stationed in Japan, and the record is framed as a sailor's letter home to his wife and newborn son. (It's loosely based on a letter his grandfather wrote his grandmother).  It's a deeply personal album that, while establishing Simpson as the defining songwriter of his class, displays an artistic growth that defies any sort of easy label.</p>
<p>The premise—a concept album addressed to his own son and wife—might sound corny, but the result is a beautiful and earnest record that flips the defeatist subtext of <i>Metamodern</i> on its head. The moods on <i>A Sailor's Guide to Earth</i> are brighter than on <i>Metamodern</i>, and the instrumentation on songs like “Keep It Between the Lines""—much of it provided by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2240-sharon-jones-and-the-dap-kings/"">Sharon Jones' backing band, the Dap-Kings</a>—is denser, bolder, and more rhythmic than anything Simpson has steered previously. (Simpson produced the record himself, deciding to spend his Atlantic Records budget chasing his instincts to their logical extreme). At the climax of side A, Simpson tosses in a countrypolitan <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/64361-sturgill-simpson-covers-nirvanas-in-bloom/"">cover</a>; one of the LP's more jarring moments occurs when Simpson sings “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbgKEjNBHqM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sell the kids for food</a>"" on an album addressed to his son. To watch Simpson stretch (and succeed) is thrilling.</p>
<p>The back half of the album is less audacious, making room for more contemplative moments like the tender ballad ""Oh Sarah."" Simpson holds onto the sneaky cleverness that distinguished <i><i>Metamodern—</i></i>""Get high, play a little GoldenEye/ That old 64!"" Simpson shouts on ""Sea Stories,"" like he's fondly remembering an old Cadillac—while taking a completely different journey.  If <i>Metamodern</i> was Waylon Jennings eating tabs of acid on a Tennessee back porch, <i>A Sailor’s Guide</i> is something like the musical combination of <i>Moby Dick</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22874-elvis-presley/"">Elvis</a>.</p>
<p><i>A Sailor's Guide to Earth</i> plants Simpson at the forefront of <a href=""http://www.gq.com/story/meet-the-country-badasses-from-nashville"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the current crop of artists living beneath the always-contentious ""alt-country""  banner</a>. But what's most striking is how it completely redefines Simpson's own career, and sets him on his own unique path.<span id=""docs-internal-guid-ddae093c-f41c-6a09-e72b-2899d331133e""> <i>Metamodern</i> became the subject of<a href=""http://www.gq.com/story/meet-the-country-badasses-from-nashville"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> trendpieces</a>, where critics and fans alike willingly read into the drugs-and-darkness subtext that Simpson has himself been reluctant to endorse. But <i>A Sailor's Guide to Earth </i>is such a rearrangement of Simpson's sonic universe that any previous categorization now seems out of date. His earlier records communicate a weariness, dedicated to the journey to whatever's at the end of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgArKYUYP0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that long white line</a>, even if it's sorrow. <i>A Sailor's Guide to Earth </i>takes a trip somewhere entirely different and life-affirming.</span></p></div>"|21758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21758-a-sailors-guide-to-earth/|8.0|Corban Goble

Though they were often unfairly regarded as sonic lightweights in regards to their peers—perhaps due to their airy vocal harmonies—Lush were always a formidable live act, capable of delivering sweetness and noise in equal measure. And while so many of their shoegazing brethren wrote lyrics that were as amorphous as their guitar effects (and then buried them deep in the mix), Lush traded in emotional intelligence, crafting songs that were as lyrically sharp as they were sonically adventurous.</p>
<p>Given the recent spate of shoegaze-era reunions—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3574-ride/"">Ride</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a>—it’s something of a no-brainer that Lush would finally be making a comeback. Rather than simply embark on a cash-grabbing nostalgia tour, the band recorded <i>Blind Spot</i>—a sparkling 4-song EP that marks their first new output in two decades. Hewing closely to the ephemeral vibe of 1990’s <i>Gala</i> and the more plaintive tracks sprinkled across 1994’s <i>Split</i>, these new Lush songs are instantly unmistakable—the pairing of co-frontwomen Miki Berenyi and Emma Anderson’s voices and chiming guitar tones sounding every bit as diaphanous as they did over 20 years ago.</p>
<p>“<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62752-lush-announce-blind-spot-ep-share-out-of-control-video/"">Out of Control</a>”—the EP’s first single—offers the kind of romantic yearning that made old songs like “Last Night” and “Desire Lines” such compelling listens. “I can’t understand why you won’t take my hand,” sings Berenyi throughout the track, “Out of control but I love you so much.” Elsewhere, “Burnham Beeches” bubbles with the same kind of lovelorn effervescence of <i>Spooky</i>’s “Untogether” (“I’m so shy, I never speak a word till we’re on our own,” admits Berenyi. “That’s just fine, as long as everybody leaves us alone.”) Closing track “Rosebud” is an oddly beguiling take on a Grimm ""Sleeping Beauty"" narrative in which the threat of eternal slumber is both ominous and strangely tantalizing: “Goodnight my baby girl and dream of Paradise/ My thorns will cradle you with love.” It would sound more sinister if the song itself wasn’t so lovely—all gently strummed rhythm guitar, gently shaken tambourine, and quietly employed strings.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while many of the Lush’s dreampoppy peers and 4AD labelmates either dramatically crashed and burned or simply fizzled into obscurity, Lush ended their first career run on a tragically bittersweet note. The band’s last full-length, 1996’s <i>Lovelife, </i>was a commercial and critical high—a razor sharp feminist kiss off and hook-filled antidote to the laddish mentality of late '90s Britpop. At a moment when they might have parlayed the success of songs like “Single Girl” and “Ladykillers” into even bigger mainstream success, drummer and founding member Chris Acland took his own life. It proved to be a loss so profound that it appeared as though it would essentially silence the band forever. It’s hard not to think of Acland when listening to “Lost Boy,” the EP’s simplest and most haunting track. “I should have never let you out of my sight,” sings Berenyi. “Desperate to be beside you, I didn’t know I’d never see you again.” Whether or not the song is an oblique reference to Acland’s passing, it hints at the kind of abject heartbreak that is often impossible to overcome, making the band’s poised return all the more remarkable. </p>
<p>If there’s a weakness with <i>Blind Spot</i> it might simply be its brevity, or perhaps the marked absence of the kind of swaggering sonic guitar bombast the band unleashed in old songs like “Sweetness and Light” or “Superblast!.” Regardless, <i>Blind Spot</i> feels like an assured—albeit somewhat tentative—way for the band to dip their toes back in the water. It would be great if  the EP served as something more than just a primer for the band’s forthcoming reunion tour. Hopefully it will provide the kind of emotional throat-clearing they need in order to set about recording another full-length record. Clearly, they still have plenty to say. </p></div>"|21791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21791-blind-spot-ep/|7.6|T. Cole Rachel

The New York improv scene was at the time especially vital, but like any other young, hungry player, Harrington began to dabble outside of jazz so as to have enough working gigs, doing time in metal, synth-pop, and indie bands. With Darkside now on indefinite hiatus and Harrington’s profile significantly raised, it makes sense that he would form his own band and circle back to his improvised music roots.</p>
<p>Following the downtempo <i>Before This There Was One Heart But a Thousand Thoughts</i> EP is <i>Become Alive</i>, Harrington’s debut album as a leader, which features instrumental configurations ranging from duos to 11-piece ensembles. Opener “White Heat” is made by a five-piece, and finds Harrington’s group creating a dark, foreboding mood, as he coaxes flares of feedback that suggest a fire at the horizon. But even as it builds across its seven minutes, there’s little actual movement. Volumes swell and recede, cymbals sizzle and settle back in, but rather than resolving tension, “Heat” just dissipates.</p>
<p>That dynamic holds true the rest of <i>Become Alive</i>, which accentuates texture and mood over structure and melody to a fault. The unsettling atmosphere draws you in, but there’s a sameness to the eight tracks that makes distinguishing individual parts difficult, in part because every instrument finds itself in the service of ambience rather than melody or meter. “Slides,” arranged for Harrington and John Stanesco’s bass clarinet, suggests disused industrial space, the electronics churning far in the background like discarded machinery. Its function is mainly interstitial, leading into “The Prophet,” wherein the drums and percussion clatter in an increasing pace without ever settling on an actual rhythm.</p>
<p>The highlight is the title track, a nearly 10-minute epic that features 11 players and some new timbres: vibes, flute and soprano sax. The group works right up to a boil, the woodwinds swerving around the other instruments. Harrington’s guitar has plenty to engage with here, be it the high register of the saxophone or the rumbling percussion, suggesting Santana at his earliest and most incandescent. The piece continues to build and build, reaching a massive, full-blown climax that justifies its lengthy runtime.</p>
<p>The album ends on a stronger note. “Spectrum” mixes vibraphone, theremin, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16952-fender-rhodes/"">Fender Rhodes</a> and Harrington’s pedal steel, a curious array of instruments that come together to suggest a weightless, sparkling space that slides ever so slowly towards dissonance. The new age ambience of “All I Can Do” leads into <i>Become Alive</i>’s most driving and most lyrical number. Harrington’s solo shows that while he’s adept at embracing bleak, desolate atmospheres with his fretwork, he’s just as capable of moving towards the lighter side. If the first half of the album has a lethargic sense that record never quite shakes, the last two tracks suggest there may be more for the group to explore in the future.</p></div>"|21699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21699-become-alive/|6.7|Andy Beta

For years now, sheriffs at Apple Music and Tidal have struggled to convince customers in the Americas, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere to pay for their damn music<b> </b>already. And yet, across the sea in Japan, folks continue to play by the rules—and what’s more, they’re on track to surpass the United States as the world’s most lucrative music market. Unlike most of the world, Japan didn’t experience the Napster revolution; in fact, the supposedly obsolete CD continues to account for about 85 percent of sales. Moreover, the major streaming services (and their exclusive releases) have yet to become available in the country. In other words, while we’ve been blasting three different incarnations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>’s latest album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21542-the-life-of-pablo/"">The Life of Pablo</a></i><i> </i>for two months, over 127 million people have been sitting in the dark; until the album’s broader global re-release earlier this month, 2016’s most-hyped album was little more than a Dark Tidal Fantasy. What was a Kanye stan to do? </p>
<p class=""p1"">The solution couldn’t be more obvious for <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/toyomu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toyomu</a>, a Kyoto-based producer and ’Ye diehard: if he couldn’t listen to <i>The Life of Pablo</i>, he’d have to make his own version. ""I thought it might be a good idea to make the whole album without listening to it,"" he told <i>Pigeons and Planes. </i>Ironically, the same digital forces that kept him from hearing the album proved key to his reinterpretation. Thanks to WhoSampled and Genius, the producer was able to assemble a complete listing of every last obscure sample and punchline featured on the record, providing Toyomu with the material for his own ""<a href=""https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/692083418083921921"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Album of the Life</a>:"" <i>印象III : なんとなく、パブロ</i>, or<i> (Imagining ""The Life of Pablo"")</i>. The project isn’t so much a recreation as it is an uncanny, absurd outlier among the scores of fanservice-y ’Ye mash-ups populating the internet.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Life of Pablo</i>—and obviously, Toyomu’s project<i>—</i>wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the internet. West has vowed never to release the project across physical formats, instead relying on streaming to drive its success. (The record recently became the first to top the Billboard charts primarily from streaming.) This has created headaches and opportunities alike: Liberated from the finality of a CD pressing, the album—like its creator, and the internet at large—remains in perpetual flux, its trappings mutable. As Toyomu put it in a <i></i>Genius interview, it's ""an eternity of creativity."" Accordingly, the record feels more like a snapshot than like a tacit statement. </p>
<p class=""p1"">If you thought <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"">Yeezus</a><i> </i>was esoteric, just try to make it through<i>印象III : なんとなく、パブロ—</i>It makes West’s opus sound like a <i>Rockabye Baby! </i>installment, primarily because it sounds so inhuman. All of the lyrics are fed through Apple's text-to-voice function, giving us a record performed entirely by Microsoft Sam (known to most listeners as the stiff-sounding android that ""sings"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>’s ""Fitter, Happier."") Obviously, the robot sucks at rapping, stripping the songs all nuance in syllable stress and meter, particularly on the standout cuts. Lead single ""<a href=""https://toyomu.bandcamp.com/track/--14"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">有名税</span></a>"" (""Famous)] collapses under the weight of all its lyrical moving parts, transmitting the braggadocio into paranoid-sounding pep talk. ""I made that bitch famous/God damn/I made that bitch famous/Talk that talk, man"" deadpans simultaneous MC/hypeman Sam, unable to distinguish between West’s rhymes and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5427-swizz-beatz/"">Swizz Beat</a>’s ab libs. (A similar phenomenon lends hilarity to ""ゆらゆらボックス 0"" (""Waves""), with Chris Brown’s smooth tenor taking the form of a high-pitched, drunken warble.) Even ""Low Lights,""—a song centered around Sandy Rivera's passionate inspirational speech—feels mechanical, her every syllable stuck to a hollow, randomly-pitched keyboard plunk in a manner that channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4641-wesley-willis/"">Wesley Willis</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The technology detracts from the latent menace in West’s raps as well, even as the established samples on ""Freestyle 4"" and ""FML"" drive the darkness home. In Toyomu’s world, the agitated, carnal queries on the former track (""What if we fucked right now?/What if we fucked right in the middle of the goddamn dinner table?"") may very well have come from a curious eight-year-old. The chuckle-inducing moments are frequent (not to mention steadily grating), but there’s ample darkness lurking in the margins: On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17906-kanye-west-real-friends/"">Real Friends</a>"" and ""Highlights,"" Toyomu digs up the angst buried within West's gospel-infused opus. Meanwhile, ""I Love Kanye"" is entirely devoid of its a cappella cheer, replaced by a nightmarish duet delivered atop mournful keyboards: following an eerie, monotone Japanese recitation of the track's lyrics, a choir of English-speaking androids come in to proclaim their love for West. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In terms of creepiness, however, nothing compares to ""nikeezy,"" Toyomu’s take on ""FACTS."" The less-than-two-minute track transports me back to a traumatizing video from my high school physics class that simulated death by black hole. In this case, it’s Kanye who’s being sucked up by the end of it all, his repeated chants of ""Yeezy, yeezy, yeezy"" stretching and spinning as the rapper floats along the event horizon. The syllables collide with increasing force and velocity, until the song's ""Street Fighter"" sample resets the sickening cycle with a Sonic Boom. It’s impossible to listen to the track without cracking up, and yet it haunts me more than any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"">Prurient</a> song—not just because it’s terrifying, but because it illustrates the artist's absurdity more than any interview or album ever could. Kanye’s hubris drives our obsession with his art and persona—as well as his own destruction. The celebrity, the memes, the outbursts, the KTT stans—they’re all window dressing to distract from the void that threatens to consume him, and us.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>印象III : なんとなく、パブロ </i>may sound like a bit like an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> album at moments, but it’s unlikely to break out of the fan-content niche any soon. Microsoft Sam’s goofy rhymes get old quick, the half-baked, discombobulated arrangements lack the nuance to compel repeat listens, and save for awesome, video-game influenced reworkings of ""Fade"" and ""Siiiiiiiiilver Surffffeeeeer Intermission"" (the latter incorporates music from the notorious, well-soundtracked ""Silver Surfer"" NES gam<i>e</i>), most won’t be reaching for Toyomu’s takes over West’s. That said, such surface-level aesthetic arguments distract from the album’s sterling achievements. This strange little record has certainly refigured how we view streaming’s ubiquity in the today's industry—not to mention how we perceive the ""global album""—but it’s also opened the doors for transcending such barriers through creative drive and compositional savvy. If we can’t have #Tidalforall, at least we can take the power into our own hands.</p></div>"|21831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21831-iii-imagining-the-life-of-pablo/|6.0|Zoe Camp

Though in Dibb’s case, that’s mostly a function of spotty attendance. He’s the only Animal Collective member still taking advantage of the group’s formative open-door policy, having appeared on just five of their 10 official albums, and his perceived expendability is further underscored by the fact the band’s most successful record to date—2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/"">Merriweather Post Pavilion</a>—was recorded without him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his status as Animal Collective’s resident black sheep was further entrenched by the well-intentioned but ill-conceived <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legupmgmt/deacon-animal-collective-at-the-festival-in-the"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kickstater campaign</a> he used to announce this debut solo album way back in 2009. After crowd-sourcing over $25,000 to fund a festival trip-cum-recording mission to Mali—with promises of an accompanying picture-book to complement the resultant album—Dibb provided scant updates about the project’s status for the better part of seven years, <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legupmgmt/deacon-animal-collective-at-the-festival-in-the/comments"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">causing many donating AnCo fans to lose their chill</a>. But this would-be scandal failed to address a more prosaic problem: as Dibb <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1091-why-animal-collectives-deakin-took-7-years-to-make-his-kickstarter-funded-album/"">recently relayed to Pitchfork</a>, the extended delay was mostly the product of chronic, near-paralyzing self-doubt about the quality of his material and vocal performances.</p>
<p>Now, having long ago donated the majority of the Kickstarter proceeds to a Malian NGO, Dibb has finally emerged with a mostly self-financed, small-scale album that was quietly released this month in a special cassette/book edition for donors (and on <a href=""https://deakinjams.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> for everyone else). But despite all the Kickstarter confusion and communication breakdowns, none of Dibb’s out-of-pocket supporters should feel short-changed. Because whatever anxiety Dibb felt about not following through on his Kickstarter campaign has been channeled into a wonderful little album about overcoming the anxiety of not following through on your Kickstarter campaign. Okay, so <i>Sleep Cycle</i> doesn’t include any lyrics that specifically reference inflated funding targets and comment-section outrage, but this exercise in self-help psychedelia provides a poignant portrait of an artist regaining their confidence one song at a time. It’s a short album—six songs, 33 minutes—but a substantial one, a deeply personal work that takes us inside the mind of Animal Collective’s most mysterious member, while restoring some of the patience and mystique that’s been sucked out of that band’s recent, more spasmodic work.  </p>
<p>To date, Deakin's biggest solo vocal was on the swirling <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16980-centipede-hz/"">Centipede Hz</a> </i>centerpiece “Wide Eyed.” But even if <i>Sleep Cycle</i>’s opener, “Golden Chords,” finds him crooning in a heretofore-unheard higher register, it’s instantly identifiable as an Animal Collective product, its field-recording ambience and hypnotic acoustic oscillations conjuring allusions to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs/"">Sung Tongs</a></i> (ironically, another AC album that Dibb sat out). But Dibb’s lyrics are far more lucid and plaintive than anything <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4174-avey-tare/"">Avey Tare</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"">Panda Bear</a> were attempting back in 2004: “Stop believing your being’s been shattered and distorted/ because, brother, you’re so full of love,” he sings atop a beautifully aching melody, and though the lyrics are delivered in second person, you get the strong sense Dibb is singing them into a mirror.</p>
<p>As a vocalist, Dibb is positioned about halfway between Panda and Avey—not gifted with the natural angelic grace of the former, yet more plainspoken and less prone to hysterics than the latter. But he knows how to get the most out of it, immersing his voice in his aqueous mixes without obscuring its emotional intent. Amid the phantasmagoric dub-pop of “Just Am,” he sings, “I’ve lost my voice, I need direction,” so he relies on the song’s repeated juju guitar lick, steam-piped beat and drifting piano chords to show him the way. And if unadorned opening verse of “Footy” initially puts some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2659-jeff-mangum/"">Jeff Mangum</a>-like strain on his cords, they prove resilient enough to withstand the incoming onslaught of percussive shocks. True to its title, “Footy” essentially sounds like Dibb kicking a drum set down a never-ending flight of collapsing stairs, pausing at each wobbly landing before working up the strength for another punt. But just as the song seems like it’s going to completely combust, an encroaching tsunami of analog synths washes the destruction away, representing the victory of inner peace over external pressure. </p>
<p><i>Sleep Cycle</i>’s weightier tracks are threaded together through brief interstitials featuring street recordings of Malians that Dibb encountered on his African excursion, but they’re more than mere vacation souvenirs—on “Shadow Mine,” he mutters his own affirming words overtop a Malian chant, and the effect is like eavesdropping on the private prayer of someone working up the courage to face the outside world. “Seed Song”, meanwhile, answers the cacophonous chaos of the aforementioned “Footy” with a rippling, pulse-regulating soundscape that provides another vivid reminder of Animal Collective’s mid-2000s masterworks. But the closing, stargazing ballad “Good House” is less about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/"">Feels</a> than the #feels. Atop a churchly, Spiritualized-style sway, Dibb dispenses reassuring mantras (“Breathe in without/ Breathe out you’re alright/ Breathe in with all/ Spit out all that rage/ You’re safe now/ Don’t fight”) much as he did back on “Golden Chords.” But here it sounds less like a personal therapeutic exercise than the sage advice of someone who’s survived a crisis of confidence and is now trying to help you cope with your own. And surely, that’s a reward more valuable than anything promised on his Kickstarter page.</p></div>"|21822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21822-sleep-cycle/|7.6|Stuart Berman

For Johnny Cash, it burned, burned, burned in an unholy ring. You might expect, then, that a record titled <i>Love Letter for Fire</i> would pay direct homage to the power of those crackling flames.  But instead, Sam Beam and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10471-jesca-hoop/"">Jesca Hoop</a> deliver a gently rolling record that recalls healing summer storms more than destructive blazes.</p>
<p>You'll know Sam Beam as the bearded fellow behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26448-iron-wine/"">Iron &amp; Wine</a>, while Hoop is an American singer-songwriter who now calls Manchester, England home. The two co-wrote the thirteen duets that comprise the record, and they're all seamless amalgamations of each writer's poetic songwriting style.</p>
<p>Some of these tunes are a little dark at times, like the lonely and hopeful ""Soft Place to Land,” but these songs never feel beholden to any particular sadness—or for that matter, joy. Even with its moment-to-moment ups and downs, the album keeps an even keel that refrains from ebullient delight or languishing sorrow. It's a surprisingly fertile middle ground that's only effective thanks to the pair's beguiling lyrics.</p>
<p><i>Love Letter for Fire</i> sounds lush and gorgeous from its outset, with arrangements that do the songs justice without being overwrought. They're rich and earthy, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4779-glenn-kotche/"">Glenn Kotche</a>'s gentle percussion grounding airy string parts. Beam's voice sounds far more at home among low-end strings and piano than it did on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17875-iron-wine-ghost-on-ghost/"">Ghost On Ghost</a></i>, his jazz-inclined Iron &amp; Wine LP from 2013. And though the instrumentation is more or less the same across the record, subtle shifts in tempo keep it from becoming a gray lump of indistinguishable, uninteresting songs. ""One Way to Pray” sways like an old porch swing, while ""Bright Lights and Goodbyes” steps lightly as it ambles along.</p>
<p>The duo's exquisite vocal harmonies are the crown jewel of <i>Love Letter for Fire</i>, with the centerpiece and single ""Every Songbird Says” maximizing each singer's strengths. Her voice is high and taut against his lower, billowing warmth. They circle each other from line to line and soar upward together gracefully on the song's high notes. The tune is a patient ode to a partner, finding satisfaction in the small stuff: ""We know when it's enough to be walking with you,” they sing. Their voices fit together so uncannily that it's like each was made to sing with the other.</p>
<p>Only one of <i>Love Letter for Fire's</i> songs stumbles: the plunking, pointed ""Chalk It Up to Chi.” Compared to the elegance of its counterparts, ""Chalk It Up to Chi” feels clunky and cartoonish, especially with Hoop's exaggerated English affectation. The rest of the record is so pretty that it teeters on the edge of precious, but fortunately, this is the only one of thirteen tracks that falls over the edge. Instead of a love letter to consuming blazes, Hoop's and Beam's collection appeals to our individual internal pilot lights: those softly smoldering flames that illuminate moments of beauty in ourselves, in each other, and beyond.</p></div>"|21800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21800-love-letter-for-fire/|7.5|Allison Hussey

L.A.-based quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29757-bleached/"">Bleached</a> have always been able to cruise in this lane fairly easily–their scrappy and infectious breakout single “Think of You” was exactly the type of ear worm that works best lazily blasted out of a drop top while riding down a palm-lined avenue. But even in the summer of 2011, there was an ever-so-slight whiff of “too little, too late” in the air surrounding the band, especially since singer/guitarist Jennifer Clavin and her sister, guitarist/bassist Jessica, were both members of cult art-punk band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8093-mika-miko/"">Mika Miko</a>, one of those locally-beloved outfits who burned out way before they reached their full potential. It's always hard to not judge a new band by the successes of their past incarnations, and by the time Bleached released their flawed-but-solid 2013 debut album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17826-bleached-ride-your-heart/"">Ride Your Heart</a></i>, they had fit themselves in snugly with the multitudes of other <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6809-the-shangri-las/"">Shangri-Las</a> idolaters from their home state, but hadn't seemed to carve out a true identity for themselves, which was a shame.</p>
<p>Luckily, with <i>Welcome the Worms</i>, that identity has begun to take form, and surprisingly, it's not rooted in '60s revivalism at all, but fast-forwards a decade into the future with a precisely jagged '70s rock edge. What's immediately striking about the album is its simplicity—its melodies are stark, clean, and in direct contrast to the lo-fi, purposefully muddled sound that has defined Bleached and bands like them up until this point. Instead of scratchy and whimsical, Jennifer's voice comes through sultry and clear. The overall feel evokes Suzi Quatro or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6249-joan-jett/"">Joan Jett</a>—women who slashed their way through a traditionally male genre using sexism's own weapons against it. On “Trying To Lose Myself Again,” in which Jennifer asserts “I know what I want/ And I know what I like/ Keep on feeling good/ Just like I always should,” you can practically feel the dirty heat rising from the Sunset Strip pavement.</p>
<p>There's an anecdote in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27645-the-runaways/"">Runaways</a> documentary <i>Edgeplay</i> where the band's bassist, Jackie Fox, describes finishing a night by vomiting banana daiquiris onto a telephone in a hotel room, only to be awakened hours later by Lita Ford trying to strangle her with the phone's cord. That's basically what “Keep on Keepin' on,” sounds like: a thundering, sudden, rude awakening that swiftly establishes <i>Welcome the Worms</i> as new territory for Bleached. It calls on rock showboating just a hair, even using a clever fake-out ending three-quarters of the way through, but doesn't come off as tongue-in-cheek in the slightest. You could easily classify this record next to the likes of say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3681-sahara-hotnights/"">Sahara Hotnights</a> or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1129-the-donnas/"">Donnas</a> (a compliment or a curse, depending on how old you were in 1999), with the exception that it deftly avoids gimmickry where more purely rockist acts may bask in it.</p>
<p>However, simplicity is a fickle beast, and one that's difficult to maintain. Although <i>Welcome the Worms </i>starts off with a bang, it gradually loses that momentum as it goes on—and at only ten short tracks, it's a problem it never has time to overcome. “Chemical Air” makes perfect use of Bleached's airtight three-part harmonies, but by the time to get to tracks like “Desolate Town” and the downtempo “I'm All Over the Place (Mystic Mama),” that electricity has all but dissipated. While not a record of cast-iron slam dunks, <i>Welcome the Worms</i> possesses enough raw power to cast Bleached in a completely different light, and one that is considerably more sustainable than their debut.</p></div>"|21733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21733-welcome-the-worms/|6.9|Cameron Cook

His debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5474-i-phantom/"">I Phantom</a>, remains one of Def Jux’s seminal achievements and it is still his best work to date, a concept album on how black people are disenfranchised by the American system. He has always been equal parts revolutionary and educator, finding his way through carefully-articulated syllabic mazes in search of hard truths. He doubled-down on this in his last two albums, the surging class evaluation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9121-mo-mega/"">Mo’ Mega</a> and its heavy-handed followup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12930-i-heard-it-today/"">I Heard It Today</a><i>.</i> After a seven-year absence from rap, he has returned with <i>Don’t Look Down</i>, his first album on Mello Music Group, a sharp technical marvel and a meditation on all that’s brought him here. This is a record of the weary lecturer, one who has long been fighting the good fight with little to show for it. But Mr. Lif doesn’t ever wonder if it was all really worth it; he merely acknowledges the cost.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Unlike past sanctimonious lyrical displays, which read like condensed civics seminars, these raps are riddled with mentions of missed opportunities and internal self-doubt, and they’re delivered with a dryness that only enhances the candor. The what-ifs  here are personal, not historical or conspiratorial. “Well I’m sitting at my table now, hands crossed, blast off/ Thinking ‘bout some opportunities that I had passed on/ Hindsight is 20/20, thinking isn’t helping any/ Drinking will just serve to end me/ Progress, am I making any?” he raps on “Everyday We Pray.” It's a peek into the exhaustion of the lifelong renegade: When your life’s work is beating your head against the walls of the political establishment, it’s natural to wonder if it has actually done any good.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lif has sought to use his career to explain complex ideas to strangers, yet he’s spent just as much time making basic ideas complicated. “The goal is to search deeper and go smarter and think harder,” he raps on “Let Go,” but overthinking has always been one of his weaknesses. <i>Don’t Look Down</i> keeps things relatively simple, opting for narratives and wordplay that are far more approachable. What ties the whole experience together is his cautious optimism, along with his still-firm belief that struggle builds character. <i>Don’t Look Down</i> openly acknowledges doubt but never succumbs to it, instead using it as a balance for self-righteousness. There aren’t any regrets, only lessons learned. The emotional (and literal) centerpiece for the album is “A Better Day,” which opens with a snippet of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s speech “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop.” In it, Mr. Lif  uses the full arsenal—his lyrical dexterity, his reflexive flow, and his observant eye—to paint a vibrant picture in broad strokes.</p>
<p>And yet the best moments on the album are the free-wheelers, records that aren’t anchored by any weighty concepts, allowing him to just be the proficient rapper that he is. On “World Renowned,” the fun-loving energy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29549-del-the-funky-homosapien/"">Del the Funky Homosapien</a> rubs off, and over a skipping loop it sounds like both tag-team partners are having a good time. Lif snuggles into the undulating wave on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1297-edan/"">Edan</a>-produced “Whizdom,” which billows around him. The best of these is “Mission Accomplished,” which reunites the Perceptionists and finds the two emcees finishing each other’s syllabic yarns in call-and-response. It’s in the moments when he isn’t tethered to any belief system that Mr. Lif sounds most liberated.</p>

""Sometimes I’m like… Oh my god, this sounds too much like [Kid] Cudi,"" the then-sophomore in college jokingly worried in an interview with <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/30/tunji-ige"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fader</a> around the time he released his first project in 2014. A couple years later, on Ige’s new EP, <i>Missed Calls</i>, the comparison holds, and he more obviously channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> throughout, trying on their flows and crafting quiet homages out of beats. On one song he brags: ""This is post-backpack, post-swag rap, the end of trap, and it’s not wack."" It’s kind of a corny line, and Ige is actually at his best melding these hip-hop sub-movements he’s hoping to push past, but it’s also an emotionally honest survey of the land for an in-between generation.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Missed Calls</i> is the product of a collaboration between Ige, a 20-year-old Philadelphian son of Nigerian parents, and Noah Breakfast, an increasingly important behind-the-scenes force in the same city. Breakfast previously made up the production half of the college hip-hop duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29839-chiddy-bang/"">Chiddy Bang</a> under the name Xaphoon Jones and has more recently clocked work for acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31525-rome-fortune/"">Rome Fortune</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30453-baauer/"">Baauer</a>. Ige is an inventive, minimalist producer on his own, and Breakfast’s touch articulates his ideas, sculpting rough drafts into finely-tuned productions. The result is a noticeably well-mixed record, and while Ige has an undeniable imitative propensity, <i>Missed Calls</i> also sounds contained and consistent, like it belongs entirely to him alone.</p>
<p> Generally, the EP leans warmly electronic with sounds that swell instead of crackle. Album opener ""Change That"" splays ambient synths on top of snappy drums while Ige waxes about his come-up. Ige isn’t a flashy lyricist and some of his raps are overly predictable, but his restraint and smart approach to song structure are his best skills, assets that make him more valuable as a hopeful hitmaker than as a cypher cameo. More importantly, he’s got an ear for catchiness and is a capable enough singer to carry his own hooks.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On ""War,"" the only song produced solely by Breakfast, Ige delivers a mumbling and monotonous sing-song, but it works for the sparse, subdued vibe. On ""22,"" a dramatic, self-serious reflection on being an ascendant 20 year-old rapper, Ige is at his most intimate, but remains a vague and low-stakes writer. ""The only road I see is by your side / And know I really could be that guy,"" he sings affectionately. The song sandwiches a 32-bar verse between strategic bridges and a chanting hook. Like the rest of <i>Missed Calls,</i> you might not double back on a single verse or particular turn of phrase, but Ige’s talent is in pushing a song forward and fleshing it out completely.</p>
<p>The best songs on the album are in the middle and in succession. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17838-tunji-ige-on-my-grind/"">On My Grind</a>,"" the EP’s spacey trap lead single, is rightfully Ige’s biggest hit to date and packages his most accomplished burst of rapping into a pair of verses, the first of which bundles a succession of oddball but obvious similes (""She Bollywood dance like Punjabi / Slum Dog nigga eating Mahi,"" he raps). The minimalist production interlocks entirely, leaving no open space until a breaking point liberates the hook. ""Bring Yo Friends"" is an earworm with a simple, bassy foundation and ad-libs—a persistent ""Yeah!"" tacked onto the end of each line—that nod affectionately to Juvenile’s late-’90s bounce smash ""Back That Azz Up."" ""You should bring your friends yeah, bring your friends yeah!"" Ige chants. It’s carefree and simple, inspirational and party-worthy. There’s no narrative ambitions to bog things down, it’s just an obvious hit about having fun. It’s Ige at his best, accomplishing a lot with a little.</p></div>"|21824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21824-missed-calls/|6.8|Jay Balfour

His spare acoustic sound pulls from the late ’60s and early ’70s, particularly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW1jliOJ1dA&amp;nohtml5=False"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">baroque country mode</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLsoQU_rlso&amp;list=PLwjD81rPeQqUrSM7v1WrV6euQ0PsBz_xb&amp;nohtml5=False"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Songs of Leonard Cohen</i></a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEV5KSBl7rs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lee Hazlewood</a>. But where the well-read novelist Cohen was comparing mythologies and Hazelwood held forth like a wizened industry cynic, Morby’s earlier work refracted meaning through the lens of his record collection. His debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18796-kevin-morby-harlem-river/"">Harlem River</a>, featured one song about a slow train, another about walking on the wild side, and a third with a line about going down to the station with a ticket in your hand, as if were still possible to buy paper tickets ahead of time. But connecting directly to the real world isn’t exactly Morby’s point. His music comes from another place, one where you try and piece together meaning by tapping into a kind of collective unconscious, using whatever tools you have at your disposal. And his references add up to something more than their parts and when paired with his unerring feel for arrangement and style.</p>
<p>Morby’s own albums keep getting better, and some of this we can chalk up to experience. Though he’s not yet 30, he’s been involved with a lot of records—two in his band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28076-the-babies/"">the Babies</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29202-cassie-ramone/"">Cassie Ramone</a> from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"">Vivian Girls</a>, four as a bass player in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"">Woods</a> (Morby is to Woods what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a> is to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"">War on Drugs</a>: a kindred spirit musically whose quirky vision needed more room than a band could provide), and now three as a solo artist. <i>Singing Saw</i> is his strongest album because it shows a process of refinement, and because Morby’s songwriting has become less referential and more grounded. The basic ingredients haven’t changed, but Morby is figuring out how to retain and amplify his strongest points—his weary and wise voice, his understanding of how the musical pieces fit together—and leave everything else behind.</p>
<p>On his debut, Morby’s voice cracked in places, suggesting effort that transcended ability, but <i>Singing Saw</i> finds him cool and controlled at every turn, fully aware of his limitations but confident in what he can accomplish within them. His singing is simultaneously intimate and distant, part conversation and part stylized monologue. He’s got a nasally diction with a tendency to stretch vowels that didn’t exist in the world until Dylan first gazed at the Nashville skyline and a fondness for short, direct statements that could have been written a century ago. The most contemporary piece of technology mentioned on the album is a Ferris wheel; the songs feature gardens and earth and shadows and fire and tears whose prevailing downward trajectory, yes, brings to mind rain. Single lines don’t really stand out, but Morby’s commitment to such elemental concerns has a cumulative effect, and the album’s lack of specificity becomes a strength.</p>
<p>That confidence extends to musical choices, including Morby’s tendency to let the small details of the sound do the work—he would never play five notes if four could get the meaning across. And while the core elements of his aesthetic—his deep voice with just the right halo of reverb, gently plucked acoustic guitar— are a constant, subtle instrumental variety abounds, which Morby sometimes takes great joy in pointing out. On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18135-kevin-morby-dorothy/"">Dorothy</a>,"" he sings ""I could hear that piano play, it'd go like…"" and the buzzing uptempo arrangement falls away leaving a beautiful tumble of keyboard notes, and he follows it a bar later with a paean to a trumpet player that a horn player answers. ""Singing Saw"" seems to say something about how a single tool can be used either creatively or destructively, and features the titular instrument prominently (and very beautifully).</p>
<p>For Morby, any day-to-day situation or mundane observation could spark something for his next album, and sometimes being that tuned-in can be a curse. ""Got a song book in my head,"" he sings on the album’s title track, and he climbs a hill past the houses to find somewhere quiet where he can leave them behind. He claims in press notes that he wrote the song about his neighborhood in Los Angeles, and his first album, <i>Harlem River,</i> was in part about his stint living in New York. But while many people in L.A. notice the traffic and the food and the sunlight and the celebrity culture, Morby hears the coyotes and sees the moon.</p></div>"|21681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21681-singing-saw/|8.3|Mark Richardson

Why did a 1992 recording of a work written 16 years earlier by a previously unknown Polish composer suddenly sell a million copies? Other modern Polish composers’ works weren’t exactly leaping off shelves. No one knew why, but critics, who by and large weren’t fans, offered theories; the piece was the lucky beneficiary of the early compact-disc boom, for instance. It was bathetic music, pandering to the worst and easiest film-score ideas that the general populace had about orchestral music. It sounded good at dinner parties. It was, in other words, a fluke, a misfire in the central nervous system of the collective unconscious.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As the years have accumulated, and the piece has maintained its grip on the public imagination, generating tributes and new recordings and finding use in multiple films, a simpler explanation gently suggests itself: this piece pierced something in us, gave us something we decided we needed badly. The timing of it will always be mysterious, but the basic fact seems plain: Music listeners have decided we need Gorecki’s piece, and we have made a permanent place for it in our lives. It has also, famously, saved some lives—in an NPR interview from 1995, Gorecki read aloud a letter from a 14-year-old girl, a burn victim, who told Gorecki that the music was the only thing keeping her alive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s a simple piece, at least in a harmonic sense. Works in this vein, in which songful lines move slowly against each other (Barber's Adagio for Strings comes to mind), tend to require a brisk interpretive hand—all the pathos the music needs is in the notes, and to wring any extra juice from them is to watch the whole thing curdle. What is most surprising about avant-garde saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"">Colin Stetson</a>’s <i>Sorrow - A Reimagining of Gorecki's 3rd Symphony</i> is how fully it embraces the music’s inherent sweep. Stetson’s often known for bracing music, and his fans might have expected him to cut this big souffle with quinine. But from the first movement’s opening canon, with Stetson blowing long, low notes mimicking the orchestra’s double basses, it’s pretty obvious: Whatever this piece has meant to decades of listeners, it has meant something similar to Stetson. He clearly loves it, and his recreation is nothing it not a personal act of love.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He’s assembled a small force of about twelve musicians here, including violinist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31334-sarah-neufeld/"">Sarah Neufeld</a>, with whom he recorded last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20289-colin-stetson-sarah-neufeld-never-were-the-way-she-was/""><i>Never Were the Way She Was</i></a>. Stetson arranged and produced the recording himself, playing multiple instruments, and the soprano lament is sung by his sister, Megan. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32001-greg-fox/"">Greg Fox</a>, the virtuoso drummer behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"">Liturgy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30534-guardian-alien/"">Guardian Alien</a>, fills the background with splashes of cymbal color and produces a steady thrum of double kicks. Two guitarists play high, insistent tremolos, and as the first movement reaches its peak, I was startled to realize how similar this version sounded to something by a post-rock band like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a>.</p>
<p>Gorecki’s symphony, with its deliberately simple and clear framework and soaring themes, has a lot of the same emotional appeal as those bands. But Stetson’s arrangements give that correlation a meaningful nudge, and suddenly Gorecki’s work feel less like a distant cousin to post-rock and more like a direct blueprint. This is instrumental music that embraces its undying capacity for uplift, that shakes off distinctions between bathos and pathos, between mawkish and grave, as it blasts upward. The best moments in Godspeed and Explosions songs go for the emotional jugular without caring if you squawk in protest, and so it is with Gorecki's Third Symphony.</p>
<p>Gorecki was no sentimentalist by nature. His earlier works were mostly in the serial and twelve tone-based tradition, and they haven't exactly been embraced by a fanatical general populace. But in the folk-song laments that inspired his Third Symphony, he found something that touched his heart, and he trusted it. In his work, Stetson and his collaborators have found something similar, and they trust him, too. </p></div>"|21680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21680-sorrow-a-reimagining-of-goreckis-3rd-symphony/|7.8|Jayson Greene

His first appearance for many was on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>’s <i>The Slim Shady LP</i> as one half of Bad Meets Evil on a song of the same name. He caught his second wind years later as one of the senior members of the major label castoff Voltron that is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28215-slaughterhouse/"">Slaughterhouse</a> (with Joe Budden, Crooked I, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30702-joell-ortiz/"">Joell Ortiz</a>). Most recently, he’s functioned as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"">DJ Premier</a>’s rapping partner in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32586-prhyme/"">PRhyme</a>. Royce is an excellent supporting character, but things never came together for any of his solo records, which tend to drag.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His sixth studio album, <i>Layers</i>, isn’t much different, albeit not for lack of trying. Royce checks all the boxes on paper here, fully loading it with big-time producers, skits, and tons of careful introspection, the typical keys to a success for any traditionalist rap album. But this lyrical marathon falls short by any conceivable benchmark, unable to really get going or sustain momentum until the very end. There’s also plenty of rapping about how good at rapping he is, which is almost always boring.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The main difference between <i>Layers</i> and past Royce records is supposed to be the newfound commitment to full-fledged storytelling, and it’s easy to hear those gears turning on songs like ""Startercoat"" and ""Misses."" On the former, he defends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"">2Pac</a>'s place in history, in response to the omission on Billboard's Greatest Rappers of All-Time list from last year (“If Pac ain’t on your list then you ain’t fucking logical”), using a UNLV Starter jacket as a symbol for the influence Pac had on him. On ""Misses,"" he writes about his relationship with his wife, implying it’s difficult being a married rapper. While these are functional stories with interesting plot points, they also prove he has a knack for overthinking (and oversharing), which torpedoes some of the strongest technical rapping on <i>Layers</i>. On “Tabernacle,” he tells the heartbreaking story of losing his grandmother and meeting his newborn son within hours at the same hospital. But he is incapable of building suspense or changing his tone, and what should be an epic tale is reduced to the songwriting equivalent of turn-by-turn navigation—taking readable steps toward a predetermined destination. He’s prone to rapping in bulk, and thus wants to narrate every detail of a story in a linear timetable, telegraphing outcomes; sometimes it’s like a nonfiction book on tape.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When he isn’t attempting to retell his story in extreme detail, <i>Layers</i> is still packed wall-to-wall with Royce's filler-filled rap style, relying heavily on knotty, tightly-packed cadences. This can be dazzling, like on “Off” (“Look in the sky there's a fly sorcerer/ Eyeballing me from a flying saucer/ And my mind is like a full clip/ And my competitions' magazines are running low like the Source and Vibe offices”), and it can also be cringe-worthy, like on “Wait” (“My son got on them 350 boosts Kanye West is dressed in Bape/ Askin' me questions 'bout gettin' to second base/ Wifey textin' SMH”). Then there are outliers like ""Shine,"" where he takes a swing at singsong raps and misses, and ""Hard,"" a song that doesn't even know what story it's trying to tell.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That doesn’t mean that <i>Layers</i> is a complete misfire, though, or that Royce doesn’t have outings where he rattles off some truly impressive performances. The verses on “Gottaknow” are clinical. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"">Pusha T</a>-featuring “Layers” and the somber “America” are clear standouts. The album ends strong, from ""America"" to closer ""Off,"" but much like most of Royce’s solo catalog, there aren't many songs on <i>Layers</i> that really reward replaying or close listening.</p></div>"|21829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21829-layers/|6.4|Sheldon Pearce

Instead, she declared, she would be celebrating Crab Day, and inaugurated an annual tradition of drawing crustaceans. And why the heck not? The budding surrealist realized early on that nonsense is often the best response to nonsense, that the constructs we use to prop up our lives are often totally arbitrary.</p>
<p>Named for her niece's flash of genius, Le Bon's fourth album features a song where the Welsh songwriter adopts an eerie falsetto and sings that she was born on the wrong day. A few years ago, her mum unearthed her birth certificate, and admitted to her daughter that they'd had her birthday a day off for nearly three decades. That sense of misaligned reality is the guiding force on <i>Crab Day</i>, where Le Bon establishes a strange, almost Dadaist lyrical scheme to make sense—or make more nonsense—of some unnamed life rupture that's left her grasping. Her perception is muddled, but in her solemn voice, everything appears clear: ""I'm gonna cry in your mouth,"" she sings, like that's a perfectly sensible thing to do.</p>
<p>Last year, Le Bon released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20759-hermits-on-holiday/""><i>Hermits on Holiday</i></a>, a collaborative album with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"">White Fence</a>'s Tim Presley under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32976-drinks/"">Drinks</a>. It pushed her usual pastoral post-punk into hairy, deep-fried territory; the only rule of its creation was that there were no rules. Le Bon has said that it revived her creativity going into <i>Crab Day</i>, which she recorded with her regular Welsh comrades Huw Evans (aka H. Hawkline) and Stephen Black (Sweet Baboo), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28034-warpaint/"">Warpaint</a> drummer Stella Mozgawa. Things aren't as freeform here, but in the absence of her lovely, weathered old melodies, nothing feels quite as it should be; the sound is as precisely off-kilter as touch-typing while gazing out of the window, then looking at the screen to find you've been one key to the left all along. From neatly squawking guitar, curiously skittish marimba, and wry saxophone parps, LeBon forges a chaotic cubist cabaret.</p>
<p>It's unsettling, but Le Bon's sensitivity to shifts in tone and pace, and the strange interplay between her players, make <i>Crab Day </i>feel welcoming, like an old house whose creepy anachronisms become a strange comfort. A good half of its songs wed burbling guitar parts to stark, straight-shooting rhythms, and verses landslide into choruses where her vocals cascade like sycamore leaves, but they establish and normalize Le Bon's uncanny universe, and aren't without their individual touches: the feral cat guitar mewl of ""What's Not Mine;"" what could be a maniac bashing on a metal trap door in the midst of ""I Was Born on the Wrong Day.""</p>
<p><i>Crab Day</i>'s primitivism hasn't totally sacrificed her lovely, lilting melodies, which are filled with remorse on ""Love is Not Love,"" and sad acceptance on ""What's Not Mine."" And she's transmuted the overly literal aggression of ""Wild,"" from 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18716-cate-le-bon-mug-museum/""><i>Mug Museum</i></a>, into songs that pulse with weird rushes of adrenaline. With its racing verses and ambient chorus, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18060-cate-le-bon-wonderful/"">Wonderful</a>"" perfectly captures both the mania and distraction of being thrown for a loop, and ""We Might Revolve"" makes a horror film out of needling marimba and Le Bon's observation that ""all the towns are miniature,"" which she delivers with the stern paranoia of a stoner certain they've seen something sinister in their domestic surroundings.</p>
<p>As much as Le Bon's expression on <i>Crab Day</i> feels abstract and alienating, it also speaks to a deep intimacy—perhaps one that's been lost and provoked all this discombobulation in the first place. <i>Mug Museum</i> made an emotional archive out of the dirty cups she collected in her room. Here, she ascribes impenetrable significance to inanimate objects—she feels like geometry, a dirty attic, and a humid satellite in the face of a lover—but struggles to rationalize the basics of human connection: She and the subject of her address routinely look through each other, the effect like a love story pieced together through split screen. ""How would I know you really swim in me?"" she asks on ""How Do You Know?"" ""How would I know to stay?""</p>
<p><i>Crab Day</i> is a voyage into doubt led by a queasy compass, and a ringleader who's prepared to stake out uncertain territory. Le Bon always keeps you guessing, making the old traditions of guitar-oriented rock feel arbitrary, too. Her nervy assessments of the world are filled with equal parts suspense and heart, and beautifully zany riffs, where the feeling of being frayed by uncertainty comes together into a strangely comforting patchwork.</p></div>"|21636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21636-crab-day/|8.1|Laura Snapes

It super-imposes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33532-tyler-friedmann/"">Tyler Friedman</a>'s minimalist-techno framework over the organic, improvisation-heavy approach of Swiss-born jazz drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33533-samuel-rohrer/"">Samuel Rohrer</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23400-skuli-sverisson/"">Skúli Sverrisson</a>, Charles Gayle) and then flips the script somewhat when you flip the record. But, though both pieces are titled ""YYY,"" the two different versions— the ""Original Mix"" and ""Drum &amp; Vocal Dub""—they don't draw from any of the same source material and aren't the same besides a shared core basis in overlapping rhythms.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Rohrer doesn't even appear on the original version of the piece, but the sensitivity to timbre that he shows on the alternate version undoubtedly influenced Friedman's structure and choice of sounds, most notably a synthesized percussion pattern that by the pair's own description resembles a digitized cross between a vibraphone and a kalimba. Friedman created all the sounds on the original ""YYY"" using a modular synth setup, and the kalimba-vibes hybrid tone is also drenched in pitch modulation so that the various hits sound like different-sized drops of water dunking into reverberant pools. When Rohrer does enter the picture on side 2, he supplies a vaguely tribal meshwork of hand- and stick-tapped beats, one of which gives the impression of a drum head whose tension is always changing so that the pitch bends up and down in a circular pattern.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On hearing them together, it's easy to see how the second version started out as a remix/re-imagining of Friedman's original but then evolved into its own separate piece. Both versions start out as a set of skeletal components and then swell as more and more layers of sound stream into the stereo field until, at their peak, each piece becomes quite busy. Both also make optimal use of the stereo field. But for all the thought that went into the juxtapositions here—synthetic vs. organic, improvised vs. composed—Friedman arguably covers more ground and creates a more fertile set of contrasts on his own. Rohrer would likely have matched him had he added his own, third version consisting entirely of acoustic-based sounds, or had he been left to his own devices on side 2.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On side 1, it's easy to get lost in the endless shifting between the kalimba-like pattern and the steady-hissing techno beat. On much of side 2, however, the robotic and human sounds cause more friction as they collide. Perhaps this was intentional, but since side 1 derives much of its energy from Friedman's interpretation of Rohrer's style, the drum-vocal dub leaves the listener wondering what could have happened had Rohrer returned the favor in isolation. The duo shares a rehearsal space, so the temptation to team up makes sense. And to mimic the effect of haunting sine-wave swells on the original mix, Friedman and Rohrer brought in Norwegian singer Tora Augestad, whose voice they manipulate at times so that it sounds like, say, a screeching saxophone reed or a swarm-like cloud of distortion.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Clearly, Rohrer and Friedman have been mindful of ambience and space in their separate careers up to this point—Friedman with his installations and works for film, and Rohrer doing the rounds in a number groups in the experimental jazz and ECM records orbits. Interestingly, they've chosen to give <i>YYY</i> a flat, almost space-less quality—the musical equivalent of a green screen. That decision serves as one of this EPs defining characteristics, but if there's one knock on this music, it's that it's quite literally out of place without a spacial, visual, or extra-musical dimension to go with it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In spite of its steady pulse and proximity to dance music, <i>YYY</i> is ultimately coming from a ponderous rather than sweaty place. While there are spots, particularly on side 2, that speak to something innate in the hips that wants to move, it's hard to see this music ever making an appearance in a club. On the other hand, Friedman and Rohrer favor a kind repetition that's ultimately too active to encourage trance-like zoning out. Dance fans might find it too stiff and jazz fans might find it too electronic. But alienating genre loyalists is usually a good sign that an artist is onto something. Let's hope that he and Friedman expand on this initial dalliance and come up with more.</p></div>"|21703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21703-yyy-ep/|6.0|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

""I feel uncomfortable with myself at the moment because I feel I’m neglecting that side,"" she replied. ""I’m not concerned enough about things."" She worried that the critical attention she had received for her debut album, that year’s <i>Dry</i>, was making her introspective. ""It could get really dangerous if I don’t do something about it soon,"" she said. ""I could develop a huge ego or something."" Instead, Harvey, then 22, suffered a breakdown, the result of moving to London from rural Dorset, her first big breakup, and the pressure of being the scrutinized center of a rapidly popular band (as the PJ Harvey Trio were then). From then on, her interviews became opaque. She refused to explain her lyrics or discuss much of her personal life. It frustrated journalists, but her records spoke for themselves, centering sexual and biblical apocalypse in the body of a middle-class white woman with a filthy sense of humor and a preternatural gift for the blues. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But 14 months ago, Harvey pulled off an unprecedented reveal for the making of her ninth album. She and her band recorded behind one-way glass in the basement of London’s Somerset House, as paying spectators looked on. Last October, she <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58571-pj-harvey-debuts-new-songs-and-poems-in-london/"">showcased</a> the finished songs live, along with poems (available as a book, <i>The Hollow of the Hand</i>), and Seamus Murphy’s photographs from their research trips to Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Washington D.C., which formed the record. Her creative process has never been more transparent, yet somehow, her intentions remain totally inscrutable—she’s given zero interviews since announcing the project, and considering the noncommittal dispatches she offers from these places, it's hard to know what point she's trying to make. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On 2011’s groundbreaking<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15120-let-england-shake/""><i> Let England Shake</i></a>, all roads led back to England and its role in various 20th century international conflicts. If there’s a unifying thread between the desolate global vignettes of <i>The Hope Six Demolition Project,</i> it’s that Washington has a tendency to leave its business unfinished. The U.S. wades into communities at home and abroad in the name of improving conditions, whether through toppling dictators or tearing down unsafe housing projects, but ultimately disenfranchises them, amputating the infected limb and driving off with the crutches. This is her <i>Let America Shake</i>, if you will. </p>
<p>However, she can be strangely thoughtless here, in ways that aren't easy to parse. She’s already run into trouble for the album’s opening track, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/64229-pj-harvey-shares-the-community-of-hope-video/"">The Community of Hope</a>,"" which offered a dispiriting portrait of the D.C. neighborhood Anacostia. Local activists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/64167-pj-harvey-criticized-by-dc-politicians-over-the-community-of-hope/"">denounced</a> her characterizations of the local school as ""a shithole,"" and the addicted, homeless populace as ""zombies."" ""Or at least, that’s what I’m told,"" she sings, making clear that those were her tour guide’s words. Perhaps she’s pointing out the subjectivity of perception, but there’s a frustrating reluctance on her part to assign any value or judgment to the things she sees, other than a few trite comparisons between haves and have-nots—not least a terrible faux-deep portrait of a homeless, disabled indigenous woman drinking in a Redskins cap.</p>
<p>Whatever her geopolitical intentions,<i> The Hope Six Demolition Project</i> is her most exhilarating rock album in years, yoking the siren-like catchiness of her last great America-influenced album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3756-stories-from-the-city-stories-from-the-sea/""><i>Stories From the City…</i></a> to the swamp-tarnished filth of her classic first three records, <i>Dry</i>,<i> Rid of Me</i>, and <i>To Bring You My Love</i>. It’s leering, brash, and dissonant, but also not without its warmth: Despite the bleakness of the guided car tour in ""The Community of Hope,"" there’s a driving optimism to its droning guitar and steady drums.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At <i>Hope Six</i>’s most thrilling points, Harvey delves back into the influence of her parents’ record collection to channel the swagger of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain Beefheart</a>, John Lee Hooker, and Howlin’ Wolf. The use of this carnal, hurting tradition feels both apt and transgressive as a basis from which to examine human desertion. ""The Ministry of Social Affairs"" is hooked around the refrain from Jerry McCain’s ""That’s What They Want,"" in which the blues singer oozes, ""Oh yeah, money, honey""—likely a warning against tax collectors or gold-diggers, but also an eroticization of need. The guitar from his song evokes the soupy traffic that Harvey sees around her as she witnesses beggars taking shelter against the wall of the welfare building, but then the song’s unsteady foundations slip into a hellish, squalling cabaret, and Harvey and her band turn McCain’s line into a demonic chorus line. ""Medicinals"" is more defined, her saxophone ascending through a neat scale, but she licks the end of each line of lyrics with an acidic flourish, like a whip from her old feather boa.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After the eerie high registers of <i>Let England Shake</i> and 2007’s haunted <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10697-white-chalk/"">White Chalk</a>,</i> it’s bracing to hear Harvey <i>almost</i> back to using her voice to its fullest range. You get the sense that she’s never going to unleash ze monsta again, but she switches between full-blooded confrontation, evil cunning, haunted falsetto, and forlorn laments, bringing great zeal to her often affectless choice of language. She’s often backed up by her all-male band, who lend depth and community to a record with a very isolated perspective. They add particular soul to ""River Anacostia,"" humming its deep, smouldering melody, before chanting it at the end: ""Wait in the water/ God’s gonna trouble the water."" It’s one of the album’s more inventive phrasings—many of these songs started life as poems, and they haven’t all translated well to song. On ""The Ministry of Defence,"" the stilted verses are interspersed with thunderous, industrial clangs to fantastic effect. But elsewhere, there’s a sense of square pegs being jammed into round holes: the band’s cry of, ""Oh, near the memorials to Vietnam and Lincoln,"" isn’t going to trouble a festival crowd near you any time soon.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And <i>Hope Six</i> definitely suffers from ideas being transferred between mediums without being refashioned to fit. Along with the poetry book, photographs, and album, there’s still a feature-length documentary to come. It’s hard to think of a project that fundamentally says so little being stretched across so many outlets. It buzzes with life and thought, but it feels as if Harvey is still working out what she’s seen; or, for some reason, that she’s sublimated her gift as a lyricist. Only a few songs here feel fully written, with the requisite lens twist or intimacy to elevate them beyond attempts to translate Seamus Murphy’s photographs into words. ""Near the Memorials to Vietnam and Lincoln"" is one of them, and one of the album’s few violence-free images: A young boy pretends to throw seeds so that the birds will scatter, evoking the more literal portrayals of salvation denied elsewhere on the record. On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17936-pj-harvey-the-wheel/"">The Wheel</a>,"" as a swing chair ride turns and its child passengers flash in and out of view, Harvey is reminded of the children who died in the Kosovo War: ""Now you see them, now you don’t,"" she declares in a chilling, strident tone, over more tarnished saxophone.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But these moments of clarity are matched by an equal number of perplexing, muddled ones. For good or ill, it's impossible to know where Harvey's narrator stands in these vignettes. Occasionally we teeter on the brink of her worldview, but she always pulls away: ""A restlessness took hold my brain/ And questions I could not hold back,"" she sings on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/64660-pj-harvey-shares-new-song-the-orange-monkey-listen/"">The Orange Monkey</a>,"" but hold back she does. On ""A Line in the Sand,"" she states, ""What I’ve seen—yes, it’s changed how I see humankind,"" a promise of insight that dissolves in her mealy-mouthed assessment of international involvement in Kosovo: ""I make no excuse—we got things wrong, but I believe we also did some good."" Is she even singing as herself?</p>
<p>Harking back to <i>Let England Shake</i>, maybe her dispassionate storytelling is making a point about how we easily condemn past atrocities while failing to recognize history repeating itself before us. Questions of perspective, and how we bear witness, feel central to <i>The Hope Six Demolition Project</i>. We were voyeurs, watching her make a record about being a voyeur. Is it a deconstruction of the protest record? By pointing out the problems in these three communities, but proposing no solutions, is she just as responsible for their desertion as the global powers that came before her? You sense that the record is part of an ongoing inquiry, not a destination. Fortunately, the music often feels like salvation itself.</p></div>"|21698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21698-the-hope-six-demolition-project/|7.6|Laura Snapes

Hard to measure and, at times, hard to digest, they are experimental in the most literal meaning—not musicians exploring ""experimental genres"" of music, but ones who actually experiment, leading to music whose ideas travel the map so broadly as to be deemed unclassifiable when put together. This approach has led the band to develop passionate followers but also put themselves in a position where these constant new approaches not only alienate the mainstream but past fans as well.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given this perspective, the band’s latest release, <i>Plays the Music of Twin Peaks,</i> makes a lot of sense. It’s easy to see parallels between Xiu Xiu and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"">David Lynch</a>—both are challenging, uncompromising artists unafraid of real experimentation or the uneven results that come from it. Though the passing of time (and specifically the post-<i>Mulholland Drive</i> afterglow) has seen public view of the man’s work elevated to near-canonical status, for much of his career Lynch was seen less as a genius and more as a fascinating but flawed artist obsessed with the '50s and the death of the American Dream.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps nowhere is this mix of ""Wow!"" and ""Ungh :-/"" on display more in Lynch’s work than in 1990’s groundbreaking show ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/518-the-musical-legacy-of-twin-peaks/"">Twin Peaks</a>."" ""Twin Peaks"" was a watershed moment—the first time anyone had attempted to port sinister art-house cinema vision to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_television_networks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Three television</a>, that mainest of mainstreams—but despite What It Did and What It Meant, ""Twin Peaks"" was still a messy failure that devolved into a soap opera slop—<a href=""http://ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?boardid=40&amp;threadid=91356"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James’s search for meaning</a>, Dick Tremayne, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnT9uhdzWbU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BILLY ZANE!!!</a>—difficult for even diehard fans to stick by. But if you ""got it"" anyway, it just didn’t matter. You just put on headphones, kept watching and felt ok knowing it made you feel ok.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One of the reasons why Lynch’s work always hit hard was his way with music and sound, particularly his partnership with Angelo Badalamenti. The score to ""Twin Peaks"" is arguably Badalamenti's crown jewel, and Xiu Xiu do it justice. Their success here is twofold: Not only do they capture the haunted spirit of the show, they also provide Xiu Xiu fans with one of their strongest releases in awhile.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The simple, live-in-the-studio recorded feel helps keep the band grounded and the sound uniform, giving it the sense of a live performance. They skip the obvious choice of ""Falling"" as opener--the vocal version of the famous theme, the first music you hear on the show and ""Twin Peaks""’s most recognizable number--and opts for the instrumental ""Laura Palmer’s Theme,"" which begins not with the famous <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxIxmMcAFLQ&amp;nohtml5=False"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moby-sampled synth</a> but instead a very portentous tom drum thud followed by sustain-pedaled piano notes.  The choice here indicates upfront that they intend to evoke something deeper and more resonant than simple nostalgia.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Laura Palmer’s Theme"" is followed by ""Into the Night,"" the album’s best track, and one of three with vocals. The original, featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29150-julee-cruise/"">Julee Cruise</a>, is hard to top, but this version is bold and ominous, propulsive and mysterious. In a way, Stewart's manic delivery suits this material better than it sometimes does on his own. On the last vocal number, ""Sycamore Tree,"" they take a tune originally sung by jazz legend Little Jimmy Scott and bring it closer to ""a Xiu Xiu song"" (if such a thing exists, I guess), than anything else on <i>Plays</i>. Stewart channels the dead Scott with a caricatured capital-P Performance  that succeeds without feeling fake or contrived. O<span>n “Falling,” Stewart relies on the soaring, heart-tweaking power of the song without overselling it. </span>While Stewart’s singing in Xiu Xiu often feels like it's been appended on top of or along side of the music it accompanies, on these three it feels threaded into its fabric. I even found myself yearning for a Xiu Xiu version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV2jilTeuhM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Just You</a>,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV2jilTeuhM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""</a> the corny and inexplicable '50s ballad sung by Laura Palmer’s boyfriend James.</p>
<p>The instrumentals are nearly as strong, including ""Packard’s Vibration,"" which begins as a vibraphone-led jazz number before the distorted guitar and shimmering synths help it achieve lift-off. The only real misstep is the closer, ""Josie’s Past,"" which adds spoken word readings of entries from ""Laura Palmer’s Diary"" by band member Angela Seo.  The vocals, spoken in stilted, accented English, only call attention to the terrible cheesiness of the writing—and, god, at nearly eight minutes, it nearly dares you to stop listening before the end. Stewart gives a perfectly ridiculous thirty second reading of the '40s song ""Mairzy Doats"" (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B62P6Gm9jpE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sung by Laura’s dad Leland Palmer on the show</a>) five minutes in and the whole track would have worked better as a 60 second bit with just that.</p>
<p><span>These are minor gripes, though. Appreciators of the uncanny, the beautiful, the upsetting, the uncomfortable–all groups that contain hardcore Lynch and Xiu Xiu fans—will find something here. In evoking Lynch and Badalamenti, Xiu Xiu have made one of their most beautiful and listenable albums, one that highlights everything the band does well while shaving down the rough edges that often turn away foes and friends alike.</span></p></div>"|21749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21749-plays-the-music-of-twin-peaks/|7.7|Benjamin Scheim

It trails on the heels of 2015’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20434-ok/""><i>O.K.</i></a>, and the declarative agency found on that album has been swapped for a heavy barrage of indecision. The title track drills a series of repeat phrases into your head; ""Are you mad?"" and, ""Are you home?"", and ""I don’t know"" layering over one another, replacing the absolute knockout precision of lines like, ""And everything I said, spewed like sparklers from my mouth/ they looked pretty as they flew, but now they’re useless and burnt out,"" from <i>O.K.</i>’s ""I Admit I’m Scared."" On ""WTF,"" Smith continues to ask, ""What the fuck is a kiss anyway?/ What the fuck is this feeling?"" which are the type of unanswerable questions that – if you choose to dwell on them long enough – could cause your sense of humanity to unravel. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""> She’s always been one to thread anxiety through her work, but her keen ability to size up the situation, quickly and decisively, kept the songs razor-sharp. <i>Year of the Rabbit</i> is lacking in determination, and its hesitancy– all fuzzy around the edges – eventually becomes draining. With<span> a running time of just over 15 minutes, it</span><span>’</span><span>s a sweet little gem of an EP, but pop a valium if you play it several times in a row.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>However, there</span><span>’</span><span>s still a great deal of merit buried amongst </span><i>Year of the Rabbit</i><span>’</span><span>s</span><span> insecurities. Smith</span><span>’</span><span>s voice returns to the hushed intimacy of her earliest recordings. Even if she</span><span>’</span><span>s too timid to raise it and ask the questions, the overall sound is lush and warm and soothing. She</span><span>’</span><span>s cut back on the synths in favor of a rawer feeling of intimacy. You</span><span>’</span><span>re not listening to a studio recording, you</span><span>’</span><span>re locked in her bedroom, watching her pen the tracks.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Overall, the EP is strewn with enough tiny, beautiful moments to satisfy. By far, the sweetest and most relatable recollection occurs right at the end of </span><span>""</span><span>Drunk</span><span>"" </span><span>as the music cuts out and Smith</span><span>’</span><span>s voice dangles on the track with a lone bass note before gearing up again. </span><span>""</span><span>See you at Myrtle Broadway/ I</span><span>’</span><span>m shy and keep walking/ Your eyes as sad as tree stumps/ A nose just like a ski jump/ I don</span><span>’</span><span>t just wanna fuck/ I wanna show you love,</span><span>"" </span><span>she sings. It</span><span>’</span><span>s a powerful snapshot of desire and lust, a reminder that in order to stay with any one person for an extended period of time, you need to rediscover things about them you thought you already knew.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s important to note that the title is a reference to 2011, the last <i>Year of the Rabbit</i> and the year Smith and her friends formed the <a href=""http://theepochisnow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Epoch</a> collective—the Brooklyn-based community of artists which includes artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33431-florist/"">Florist</a>, <a href=""https://toldslant.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Told Slant</a>, and <a href=""https://bellows.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bellows</a> .(The EP was recorded with fellow Epoch collective members Emily Sprague of Florist and returning drummer Felix Walworth—who also plays in Florist and is the frontperson for Told Slant.) Smith’s descriptions of long-distance relationships and lengthy separations, of shaky stops and starts, of ""trying to be open to whatever,"" mark that year as an intense period of personal growth. Taking the time frame into consideration, <i>Year of the Rabbit</i> can be viewed as a retrospective, an artist piecing together bits of her past to gain further clarity and insight into whatever comes next.</p></div>"|21697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21697-year-of-the-rabbit/|6.8|Lindsay Hood

They were not merely embellishment of production, but rather an anchor to the style that gave credence to both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5173-tracey-thorn/"">Tracey Thorn</a> and her husband <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33590-ben-watt/"">Ben Watt</a> at the start of their respective careers. While she got her start in such post-punk outfits as Stern Bops and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24178-marine-girls/"">Marine Girls</a>, it was her hushed 1982 solo debut, <i>A Distant Shore</i>, that helped the NME set recognize Thorn. Watt’s trajectory, meanwhile, saw him being taken under the wings of such prominent English rock icons as Kevin Coyne, who produced his first single ""Cant"" upon signing to Cherry Red in 1981, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/"">Robert Wyatt</a>, prominently featured on his 1982 debut EP <i>Summer Into Winter,</i> before forging his own unique fusion of British folk and bossa nova on 1983’s <i>North Marine Drive</i>.</p>
<p>It was once thought that a full-on return to those organic roots was a bridge too far for Watt, who continued to travel further and further into London’s deep house and techno culture as the curator of both the influential late '90s/early '00s Sunday club Lazy Dog and the independent record label Buzzin’ Fly, which he launched in 2003 and ran until 2013. However, the Marylebone native<b> </b>surprised both fans and critics alike in 2014 with <i>Hendra</i>, a leftfield return to the intimate songcraft he explored on <i>North Marine Drive</i> 31 years prior as if the whole time burning up dancefloors in Miami, Berlin and Ibiza was all just something of a fever dream.<br/> <br/> And so goes the name of his third proper solo full-length, an album that continues to find Watt moving his DJ rig further into the storage unit of his creative mind in order to continue to explore his reignited love for live instrumentation. He recorded at the renowned RAK Studios in London, with the intention of melding the fineness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5191-pentangle/"">Pentangle</a> to the fury of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31601-crazy-horse/"">Crazy Horse</a>. And in its way, <i>Fever Dream</i> picks up where <i>Hendra</i> left off, as songs like ""Women’s Company"" and ""Never Goes Away"" retain the delicacy of its predecessor's finest moments. But the cranked-amp grit of the record's more combustible cuts, like ""Winter's Eve"" and ""Bricks and Wood,"" sets the scene. </p>
<p>This is the very first time we are really hearing Ben Watt in full guitar rock mode. You can certainly hear the influence of solo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12366-david-gilmour/"">David Gilmour</a>, whose appearance on ""The Levels"" was one of the highlights of <i>Hendra</i>. Yet by largely keeping the electric currents of <i>Fever Dream</i> so well mannered, however, songs like ""Gradually"" and ""Between Two Fires"" fail to muster up much excitement. The strongest material, in fact, constitutes some of Ben Watt's finest work in years. The closest he does come to integrating his Buzzin' Fly past happens on ""Running With the Front Runners"", when that whistling Moog you might have heard on some of your favorite Everything But the Girl tunes turns up. Elsewhere, an appearance by MC Taylor of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30386-hiss-golden-messenger/"">Hiss Golden Messenger</a> shines on the title cut. By the closing number, the pastoral ""New Year of Grace"", Watt lets his British folk roots show, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a> playing Jacqui McShee to his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4970-bert-jansch/"">Bert Jansch</a>. <br/> <br/>From his four decades in music to his valiant coping with the rare inflammatory disease Churg-Strauss Syndrome (chronicled in his excellent 1996 book <i>Patient</i>), Watt's career is a quietly inspiring survival story. At one point, it didn't look like Watt was going to live to see 50, considering that his illness has the potential to attack both the heart and lungs, let alone continue to release solo albums. So in that regard, <i>Fever Dream</i> is an absolute triumph. It would have been a lot more of an interesting listen, however, had he decided to really get his hands dirty in feedback and digital fuzz.</p></div>"|21742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21742-fever-dream/|6.8|Ron Hart

He and his frequent collaborator Henrik von Sivers co-produced much of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27589-fever-ray/"">Fever Ray</a>'s debut album; they also produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/395-blonde-redhead/"">Blonde Redhead</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14609-penny-sparkle/""><i>Penny Sparkle</i></a> and some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27809-glasser/"">Glasser</a>'s debut. Mannerfelt used to make stark, charcoal-dusted techno as the Subliminal Kid, and with another Swedish producer, Malcolm Pardon, he peddles burbling cosmic synth jams in the duo Roll the Dice. But the key to understanding his work under his own name lies in ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu5kGuNkkm4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Evening Redness in the West</a>,"" a strange and harrowing song from his 2014 debut album that borrows its title from Cormac McCarthy's <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Meridian-Evening-Redness-West/dp/0679728759/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460305148&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=blood+meridian"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blood Meridian</a></i>. Over flickering drones, a computerized voice intones a succession of disconnected words that might be ripped straight from McCarthy's pages: ""barren,"" ""horizon,"" ""filth,"" ""Bowie knife,"" ""blood."" It sounds a little bit like HAL, the on-board computer from <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, having a fatal meltdown in the dry Texas chaparral—an unlikely juxtaposition that goes to the heart of Mannerfelt's vivid, unconventional approach. He's no goth, exactly, but his work is deeply informed by gothic literary tropes, and in his hands, electronic music's habitual futurism looks a lot more like horror.</p>
<p>Mannerfelt's last album, 2015's <i>The Swedish Congo Record</i>, used coldwave and techno as a roundabout way of examining African percussion and European colonialism. Although the themes underlying his new record, <i>Controlling</i> Body,<i> </i>are less explicit, we can get a sense for what's on his mind from titles like ""Abysmal,"" ""The Confidence of Ignorance,"" and ""Limits to Growth."" This is chilly, forbidding stuff, setting disassembled techno rhythms against a backdrop of queasy synths and industrial clang. The ambiguity of the album title bleeds into a series of questions. What constitutes a body, for instance? What do our bodies control, and what forces control us? Is it possible that the computers are really in charge?</p>
<p><i>Controlling Body</i> opens with ""Building of the Mountain,"" in which Glasser's Cameron Mesirow, whose voice is threaded throughout the album—sometimes speaking, sometimes singing, and often just providing throaty color—sings long, clear tones that quiver against filament-bright sine waves. There's no rhythm to speak of, just a gloomy ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8VY5dxq5CU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mentasm</a>"" stab that comes hurtling across the stereo field at regular intervals. The overall impression is of Joan La Barbara leading a funeral march across the outskirts of a Belgian rave, and that bleak tone persists across the rest of the album. A few tracks are ominously atmospheric: ""Coast to Coast"" suggests sighing train whistles, and ""Abysmal,"" an ambient acid sketch, enlists a chorus of the damned to drive its apocalyptic point home. Those quieter cuts help cushion full-bore tracks like ""Limits to Growth"" and ""Perspectives,"" in which the word ""subject"" stutters and loops over punishing, shuddering rhythms. It's as through the Singularity had finally arrived, but due to insufficient bandwidth, all those uploading souls were left endlessly buffering, stuck in a kind of data purgatory.</p>
<p>Given linguistic cues like these, it's not hard to find all manner of possible interpretations for the ideas that give <i>Controlling Body </i>its substance; it's about as literary as instrumental electronic music gets. But Mannerfelt also keeps things wonderfully open-ended: The patient, glassy pings of ""The Confidence of Ignorance"" climax in a slow, rhythmic fusillade of gunshots and distant shouts, and if the source is what I think it is, that almost certainly makes this the finest album this year that samples skeet shooting. And on the closing ""I Love You,"" Glasser sings a scratchy ballad that's as foreboding as it is tender. Her presence—hushed, vulnerable, but also defiant and at times intimidating—helps emphasize the imposing scale of Mannerfelt's sweeping electronic architectures. Both breathy and carnal, she is the ghost in the machine and the body in the cloud, a specter haunting a dystopian landscape of electrical hum and binary code, the human point of reference that brings his gothic panorama thrillingly to life. </p></div>"|21780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21780-controlling-body/|8.1|Philip Sherburne

You can split hairs about the key role played by fellow ground-floor pioneers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"">Slayer</a> and Exodus, and point out that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/256-anthrax/"">Anthrax</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23607-voivod/"">Voivod</a> had also already formed by the time <i>Kill 'Em All</i> was released. You could even argue that other bands were bound to reach the same threshold of tempo and attack because the early-'80s metal underground was collectively headed in the same direction anyway—i.e: getting faster and heavier and building on the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7759-motorhead/"">Motörhead</a>, Venom, Mercyful Fate, and others.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the fact is, several key participants in thrash metal's first wave freely admit that <i>Kill 'Em All</i> gave them a framework for the sound they had all been searching for. In other words, once Metallica stepped up the pace, everyone else followed suit. Listening back through modern ears, it's almost like revisiting those first three <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">Ramones</a> records—you know this music shaped the world you live in, but since so many artists have added extra levels of intensity since then, there's no way to re-create the sensation of how revolutionary the music was during its time. Today, the sequencing sounds a little more abrupt, and a surprising share of the riffs fall closer to traditional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden/"">Maiden</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9720-judas-priest/"">Priest</a>-level heavy than outright thrash. But of course, there are moments—the crunching chugga-chugga riffs that propel songs like ""Whiplash,"" ""Metal Militia,"" for instance—where Metallica's sense of purpose crystallized, and it's easy to see why the band became known as such a genre-defining force right out of the gate.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That said, the question here is whether there's any justification for re-releasing a title that, for metalheads, is as much a ""required listening"" staple as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Led Zeppelin</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19418-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zeppelin-iii/"">first album</a> is for fans of classic rock. It's not like the original pressing of <i>Kill 'Em All</i> suffered from a muddy mix or anything—<i>dated</i>, maybe, but not anything that could be significantly improved upon via remastering. So if you already own this music, don't expect an improvement in sound quality. And if you don't own it, you may be asking yourself: do I need to pay top dollar to get the album plus several hours' worth of previously unreleased extras? For neophytes and—unfortunately, even for dedicated fans—the answer is: probably not. At first, all the extras look tempting—several complete live shows, demos and rough mixes, the ""Jump in the Fire"" and ""Whiplash"" singles (both of which come with the same two live b-sides, which was unnecessary), and an hour-plus long interview with drummer and lead mouthpiece Lars Ulrich. If the infamous band biopic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/711-music-on-film-metallica-some-kind-of-monster/""><i>Some Kind of Monster</i></a> makes you cringe at the thought of spending upwards of an hour with Ulrich talking in your ear, his Q&amp;A actually sheds a good deal of light on the early days of the band.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And, though the rough mixes vary in quality, the more fully-developed songs provide a startling new perspective on the material. Classics like ""Motorbreath"" and ""Hit the Lights"" actually sound fuller, meatier, and more vital. In this more organic form, the music breathes more. Apparently, the conventional wisdom of the time dictated that this sound was too crude for public consumption. But today, bands put a lot of effort into getting this kind of loose, raw sound on purpose. Now, we finally get to see that perhaps the final<i> Kill 'Em All</i> mix that the public got was too constricted, which makes sense given this music demanded a new approach to production values that hadn't been invented yet. But the new mastering job doesn't serve the main mix especially well. If anything, it only exposes the clenched and unnatural quality of the reverb that's applied to pretty much every instrument. Any time a vocal or snare hit rings out (like when frontman James Hetfield screams ""PESTILENCE"" on ""The Four Horsemen""), the echo tail abruptly closes shut. If you were used to listening to this album on a shitty cassette or in a car or a noisy work environment, you probably never noticed. Here, the clunky gated reverb becomes the music's most noticeable feature.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As for the live material, it would be charitable to call it ""bootleg quality."" Not to mention that multiple rounds of pretty much the same songs get old pretty quick. The one thing that fans might hone in on is the historical value of early performances of material from the band's next album, 1984's <i>Ride the Lightning</i>. A January '84 performance of ""Fight Fire with Fire"" even includes a few bars of the song's delicate, classical guitar/Randy Rhoads-influenced intro played for real. (Later live shows featured the de-rigueur prerecorded version.) It must've been exciting to be in the room—as the band played on gear loaned by Anthrax after a Boston robbery, Hetfield explains with good humor to the crowd—but listening back is more an act of archaeology than enjoyment. Sure, it's funny and you can practically picture the acne when Hetfield shouts ""Come on, I want you to scream louder than the fuckin' PA!"" to the crowd. But unfortunately, it's difficult to discern the rhythm-guitar interplay between Hetfield and lead guitarist Kirk Hammett. For a more useful document of the band's original two-guitar dynamic, you're better off going to the seminal demo <i>No Life 'Til Leather</i>, which features fellow thrash architect/future <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9199-megadeth/"">Megadeth</a> leader Dave Mustaine. (Hammett only played leads on Metallica's first five albums.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The thuggish lyrics on<i> Kill 'Em All</i> updated Motörhead's roaming-pirate vibe for a younger generation of brash American kids, as reflected in lines like ""The show is through, the metal's gone / It's time to hit the road / Another town, another gig / Again we will explode"" from the headbanging anthem ""Whiplash."" Fueled by hatred for L.A. hair metal and a pop mainstream that the band never could have dreamed would embrace it eight years later, <i>Kill 'Em </i><i>All </i>raised a middle finger in the air while sounding a trumpet of unity for metalheads everywhere with its us-against-the-world mentality. Now, of course, its youthful persecution complex seems silly and sophomoric.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But in fact, that attitude seemed silly even by 1984, when Metallica released <i>Ride the Lightning</i> and pretty much left its youthful naivete behind for good. Yes, Hammett and late bassist Cliff Burton's fascination with comic books and Dungeons and Dragons-style fantasy rears its head on ""The Call of Ktulu,"" but on <i>Ride the Lightning</i> the band no longer comes across like a street gang but like a group of frightened young men using their hellacious sound as a shield against life's unsettling realities. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Ride the Lightning</i> addresses capital punishment, death, suicide, and nuclear annihilation—basically, the array of concerns that would become metal's standard lexicon. Musically, the album represents the moment where thrash intersected with prog, thus raising the bar on technicality, structure, chops, and ambition. Its combination of broadened perspective and elevated musicianship arguably mark it as the point where metal as a whole graduated from goofy adolescent expression to an artform that could speak to thinking adults and nourish listeners long after they grew out of its primary demographic age group. In short, <i>Ride the Lightning</i> is the moment where metal developed a worldview. After <i>Ride the Lightning,</i> thrash turned into an arms race of ever-increasing technical proficiency.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Again, though, did an album of such iconic stature that has gone multiplatinum even warrant a deluxe repackaging? This new expanded edition out-does the <i>Kill 'Em All</i> reissue with more live shows (including a 1985 Castle Donington appearance), the whole album's worth of demos and rough mixes and even more audio interviews, this time featuring Burton and Hammett. Again, though, the quality of the live recordings is spotty at best. The band trainwrecks right from note one, for example, on a March '85 rendition of ""Fight Fire with Fire."" There's a fine line between warts-and-all charm and embarrassing fiasco that should stay in the vault, and this collection all too often leans more toward the latter. Even in cases where Metallica's formidable live chops come across, the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. You have to think that if better-quality recordings existed from this time period, the band would have gotten its hands on them and released those instead.</p>
<p>There's no denying the incalculable impact of either of these albums, and it certainly doesn't hurt to have an excuse to pull them off the shelf again. And sure, obsessive completist/collector types will find a lot to sink their teeth into here. But for pretty much anyone else, other than the demos and rough mixes, these sets offer quantity over quality. Not to mention that it's irritating and confusing to navigate the <a href=""http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/metallica-unboxing-of-deluxe-edition-of-kill-em-all-reissue-video/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">difference in content between the vinyl, cd, and ultra-deluxe sets</a>. Even the fairly dedicated fans who'd enjoy tracing Metallica's development as a live act during these two key stages will likely be disappointed here and are advised to steer clear and try YouTube instead.</p></div>"|21755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21755-kill-em-allride-the-lightning/|8.6|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

The Gothenburg native has that slightly wry, raspy delivery that distinguishes all the best Scandi singers, as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23583-stevie-nicks/"">Stevie Nicks</a>' pout, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>'s faith, and a way of selling her lyrics as if she's working through her dramas in real time. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a> recognized these qualities when he <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwsXo6fsmso"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sampled</a> her vocals from Niki's debut single ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnexkG4RrtA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DJ, Ease My Mind</a>"" on his 2014 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19139-skrillex-recess/""><i>Recess</i></a>, which could have primed the Swedish duo (completed by Gustaf Karlöf) for a move into the EDM big leagues. Their 2012 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16758-instinct/""><i>Instinct</i></a> was halfway there already, as massive as the mountains Dahlström sang about. But on the long-awaited follow-up, they've gone in the opposite direction, filing down the piercing sharp edges of their debut in favor of luscious synths, aqueous funk basslines, and gated drums.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's a painfully familiar pop trope in 2016, but Niki and the Dove aren't shooting for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"">muted cool</a> or ’<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/"">80s sparkle</a>—instead, they have a consummate, melancholic soulful touch, reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33163-patrice-rushen/"">Patrice Rushen</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33191-evelyn-champagne-king/"">Evelyn ""Champagne"" King</a>, and a superb way with melody. Dahlström's lyrics are also full of sumptuous details that make their songs feel like living things rather than period pieces—the guy with a soul like a Wolf-Rayet star, the ""sea fire"" of the city, ""African violet and neon blue"" skies, and in the gorgeous dancehall lilt of ""Coconut Kiss,"" a tropical hideaway so vivid you can practically feel the sea breeze wafting your pineapple-print kaftan. (It's important to note that she's not just the singer, but writes and produces with Karlöf, too.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Everybody's Heart Is Broken Now</i> is essentially a record about heartbreak, but in-keeping with the vast scope of Niki's debut, they're thinking on a global scale. As Dahlström told <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/2861629/niki-the-dove-everybodys-heart-is-broken-now/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MTV News</a>, ""We wanted to write about this greater sense of … a loss of caring. You know, it's pretty tough times in the world right now."" They've previously mentioned the rise of racism in Sweden as an influence on the record, but thankfully, they tackle these issues in spirit rather than manifestos.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Play It on My Radio"" is the only vague acknowledgement of that societal shift, where Dahlström yearns for a song that you never hear anymore: ""People looked so different then/ Because they were smiling,"" she sings tenderly over drowsy Balearic synths and a light flickering beat. Across the record, she recognizes how cruelty can fill the void made by sadness or fear—she's ""an empty shell,"" fighting the ""poison that sucks the root,"" and the sorrow that's found a home inside her. ""I'm not the same/ Can I change it back again?"" she asks on the very Stevie-circa-</span><i>Tusk</i><span> ""Lost UB.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The solution, natch, is dancing on her own, whirling herself into a frenzy to nip malignant growths like heartache and hate in the bud. ""Strangers, move away/ I'm a volcano and I'm about to blow you away,"" she commands on the strutting ""You Stole My Heart Away."" As on </span><i>Instinct</i><span>, her conviction that redemption can be found in the depth of the night is unyielding, and totally convincing. The songs themselves fill space with the same zeal</span>—every song is flooded with pearly, dazzling synths. There are a few straight-up bangers, like ""So Much It Hurts,"" or the enjoyably silly ""Shark City (Tropico X),"" with its cartoony <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9486-tom-tom-club/"">Tom Tom Club</a> vibe, and the euphoric, hopeful ""Pretty Babies."" But often, Niki favor the slow build, where a flash of emotion in Dahlström's voice prompts the song to ascend somewhere else entirely, like the massive gospel chorus that emerges from ""Scar for Love,"" or ""Everybody Wants to Be You,"" which starts off quiet before striding through three massive crescendos and screaming key changes. When so much ’80s-indebted pop slurps the silliness out of the era, their occasional embrace of excess is a tonic (even if the record runs a bit long as a whole). They always sound nostalgic, but the immediacy of Dahlström's vocals yanks all the warm, communal feelings associated with that sound into a present where they're in short supply.</p></div>"|21688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21688-everybodys-heart-is-broken-now/|7.8|Laura Snapes

His perspective wobbles hazily between navel-gazing and philosophical musings, in a way that can only be conveyed by a late '90s-born suburban kid living just outside one of the most violent inner cities in the US. His output has been all bedroom music (literally: he produced, recorded and mixed everything himself; in his Evanston, Il bedroom) and he seems willing to save the world, but only if he can get past his own self-doubt and willing alienation. ""My momma told me I am a king/ And I believe her/ Why I used to think that I wasn't shit"" he sang on ""Kings"" from last year's rewarding <i>Say It Here, While It's Safe</i> EP. On the song he also said ""R.I.P [to] my demons"" and confessed that ""today we feel like Kings/ I ain't never been this happy."" </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But euphoria is not Collins' constant companion; melancholy and second-guessing introspection are. And on his new LP, <i>Nat Love</i>—the name references the former slave, cowboy, Black folk hero, and author also known as Deadwood Dick—his tendency to turn inward and re-emerge with poetic reveries are strengths that serve him well. Thematically, Collins is more about observations than declarations, inquiry over polemic. As a former slam poet, he tends to write in circles of wordplay or elongated strands of thought that seek meaning through journal-like streams of discovery. On ""Nat's Intro"" he confesses that, ""Well, I listen to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a> and lay up/ Playin' like I am a student / I know no future is proven/ But I know some people that prove it,"" before repeatedly asking, both confident and unsure: ""Is this what you wanted?"" (His answer: ""There is no answer/ “Til you answer."")</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">None of the music sounds as dreary or as downtrodden as the lyrics would suggest: the tracks are light and bouncy, even when they're somber. There's a celestial and cosmic grace to ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18142-kweku-collins-ego-killed-romance-ft-jamila-woods/"">Ego Killed Romance</a>,"" a charming playground swing to ""Vanilla Skies,"" and a sublime flip of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"">D'Angelo</a>'s ""One Mo' Gin"" on ""Stupid Roses."" On ""Death a Salesman""—the lone track on the project which Collins didn't have a hand in producing; instead passing off duties to his Closed Sessions labelmate oddCouple—there's an inspired and melodic take on the sentiments expressed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a>'s ""I Wanna Kill Sam"": ""See, I have this Uncle Sam/ And I hate his ass so much/With a finger in my face/ As if I should give a fuck/ He said he'll give me a gun/ And he think I should shoot for him/I say, 'Sam, I think you right'/ Then I turned the gun on him,"" he raps with a chuckle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is the kind of music that's made by someone who was a toddler when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/"">André 3000</a> explored a love below and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2374-k-os/"">k-os</a> dropped his first LP. There are hints of trap, folk, and neo-soul coming together to form a new micro-genre of hip-hop that's part part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a>, part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4630-wyclef-jean/"">Wyclef</a>, part Future, part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a>. The sounds here are immersed in the dance of lingua franca and colloquialisms and tastes and cultures defined by a generation raised on playlists and the ability to stream the history of music on their phones for less than the price of a single CD. When Collins sings, he's not singing by R&amp;B yardsticks; when he raps, his vocals sound like rambling rocks in a river of thoughts, more indebted to spoken word than rap, but still more rap than spoken word.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""If I'm a rapper then she's a bad bitch,"" says Collins on ""Stupid Roses,"" a song about marijuana that doubles as a meditation on a love half-remembered but still felt. It's not the full-on ode that D'Angelo's ""Brown Sugar"" was—Collins seems conflicted about his ""love for cannabis""—and the double narrative and sense of self-hate and addiction feel like they're talking about his  greater conflicts with love and self-acceptance. On ""The Outsider"" he posits that ""love is a battlefield/ Pat Benatar shit"" and declares ""I'ma be a legend/ I'ma be a Johnny to your Dolly."" Those aren't the kind of references typical to a hip-hop song; they're the observations of an insider walking the line between finding and defining himself.</p></div>"|21812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21812-nat-love/|8.0|kris ex

Last October, noise-punk quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32208-greys/"">Greys</a> performed as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"">Smashing Pumpkins</a>, a ruse that required not just an aesthetic suspension of belief (no dollar-store blond wig can make hulking bassist Colin Gillespie look like D'Arcy) but an ideological one as well. Essentially, the Pumpkins are Greys' polar opposites. Where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/952-billy-corgan/"">Billy Corgan</a> channels themes of alienation into unabashedly earnest, immaculately rendered grunge-prog, Greys power through theirs with bull-in-a-china-shop recklessness and snarky humor. And the messianic cult of personality and gothic flamboyance that Corgan so eagerly cultivates is antithetical to Greys' everyman, stage-leveling ethos. After all, Greys are the sort of band that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNYs80Y48kQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">write songs in honour of Fugazi's Guy Picciotto</a>, while cheekily acknowledging that idolizing an anti-rock star like Picciotto is idolatry nonetheless (""You do what you do/ I do it, too!"").</p>
<p>But listen to Greys' second full-length, <i>Outer Heaven</i>, and that Pumpkins gambit seems less like a one-off goof than a practice drill for the new album's fearless embrace of both art-rock experimentalism and pop accessibility. When they first emerged in 2011, Greys came off like a less brawny, more bratty complement to fellow Toronto-scene stalwarts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30564-metz/"">Metz</a>. Singer-guitarist Shehzaad Jiwani didn't necessarily shy away from melodic choruses and introspective lyricism, but he had to blow out his vocal cords to be heard amid the band's Jehu-schooled, post-hardcore pummel. And the feelings of inadequacy he was trying to express were filtered through cheeky song titles (see: ""Use Your Delusion"") and tongue-in-cheek complaints (""Wish I was born in New York, wish I was born in L.A., wish I was born in the royal family""). But with the tranquil, starlit jangle of the opening ""Cruelty,"" <i>Outer Heaven</i> marks a clean, abrupt break from that past—not just by opening up greater spatial possibilities in the band's sound world, but by foregrounding a nakedly emotional tenor that permeates even the more typically ferocious tracks that follow. </p>
<p>Like many ’90s kids, Greys got swept up in the alt-rock revolution, before burrowing deeper underground to discover the self-sustaining network of bands and labels that laid the groundwork for it. (That evolution can be traced from the fact the aforementioned song about Picciotto swipes its opening line from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"">Foo Fighters</a>: ""There goes my hero!/ He lives right down the street!"") Now that ""indie"" has become a satellite-radio format for well-heeled commuters, it's hard to remember a time when such a discovery could be so empowering that it could alter the course of one's life. But guitar-driven indie rock's deliberately modest scale and often introverted, sometimes ironic sensibility can make it ill-equipped to address the more complex socio-political conversations that dominate our thoughts today; at a time when the top pop stars of our age are tackling big issues head on, the insular nature of indie rock can seem antiquated at best and tone-deaf at worst. For those raised to believe in indie-rock's insurrectionary spirit, it's easy to feel like you were sold a false bill of goods—a music that once seemed absolutely revolutionary now reeks of complacency and privilege.</p>
<p>Jiwani is a unique position to reconcile this divide. He's of South Asian descent, which makes him a minority amid a scene that's predominantly white even in a city as famously multicultural as Toronto. So you could say his relationship with indie rock is complicated, and that tension comes to a head on <i>Outer Heave</i>n's delirious mid-album highlight, ""Complaint Rock."" Jiwani gamely assumes the role of a slack motherfucker (""gimme gimme my gold star/ for not trying so hard""), before summing up his chosen vocation with a two-faced cry of ""I hate it!/ I want it!/ I need it! /I love it!"" That conflict is as much musical as lyrical: partway through, the song's glass-smashing abandon gives way to a gentle waves of rippling, psychedelic guitars—as if Jiwani suddenly slipped into a spa isolation-tank treatment mid-song—before it's violently thrust back into attack mode for a final blitz. And that push-pull structure presents a perfect microcosm of Greys' larger mission—as easy as it is to complain about the state of indie rock and check out of the conversation, they feel compelled to stay in the game to get the job done right.</p>
<p>On <i>Outer Heaven</i>, that means redirecting indie rock's capacity for introspection and turning its gaze outward. In the past, Jiwani has expressed feelings of otherness in more generally misanthropic terms (""wish I could be somebody else and just go,"" he declared back on ""Use Your Delusion""), but <i>Outer Heaven</i>'s searing, slow-boiling salvo ""No Star"" sees him tackling matters of race in more explicit terms: ""Don't shoot/ I'm not the enemy,"" he sings, giving voice to anxieties in the wake of last fall's Paris attacks and the subsequent bloodlusty calls for swift vengeance. And when you consider that he routinely gets <a href=""https://twitter.com/greysband/status/714076157843386368?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the third-degree treatment from airport security</a>, the harsh opening line of the industrialized stomper ""Sorcerer""—""My body makes me sick/ I'm trapped inside my skin""—assumes an even more brutal resonance. But the songs here also touch on more universal, but often documented, situations: ""Blown Out"" chronicles the effects of depression on a romantic relationship, the song's thundering thrust and surging choruses mirroring the inner turmoil of someone who's ""having a hard time when everything's fine.""</p>
<p><i>Outer Heaven</i>'s heightened ambitions are best measured in terms of density rather than sprawl: the most bracing songs here pack in more radiant guitar textures, a greater lyrical depth, and sharper hooks without sacrificing Greys' innate moshability and punk-schooled economy. Ironically, the more self-consciously outré material feels staid by comparison: the sudden grindcore shocks of ""Strange World"" can't quite force the song to shake off its dirgey gait, and though the drum machine-ticked ""My Life As a Cloud"" taps into the spectral beauty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14681-halcyon-digest/""><i>Halcyon Digest</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"">Deerhunter</a>, its trickling guitar outro closes this highly charged album on an oddly resigned note. But even if Greys are still learning how to stretch out with purpose, <i>Outer Heaven</i> serves as a most welcome reminder of indie rock's iconoclastic potential, from a band committed to the belief that it could be your life. </p></div>"|21716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21716-outer-heaven/|7.8|Stuart Berman

Their demo oozed with punk rawness, and while they sharpened their industrial instincts on their self-titled album, its production was a bit of a <i>...And Justice For All</i> situation where the fidelity didn't quite sync up with its death-dance electronics and hardcore spirit. Here, they've amassed all their best qualities on one record, and explore more connections between the two worlds they come from. </p>
<p>The four originals on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19826-youth-code-a-place-to-stand-ep/""><i>A Place To Stand</i></a> suggested a meaner, more confident Youth Code, with more intense percussion and George ceding his vocal duties and letting Taylor, who always had a more dominating presence, take over and give the duo consistency and fury. “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18067-youth-code-transitions/"">Transitions</a>” and <i>Commitment</i>'s title track stand up to “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17031-youth-code-consuming-guilt/"">Consuming Guilt</a>” and “To Burn Your World” as some of the most furious songs the band has made. Both, especially the title track, mechanize d-beat drumming, merging a natural feel with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"">Godflesh</a>-like coldness. There's swing, but it's much too fast to dance to, and staying idle isn't an option. It'd be hypnotic if it weren't for Taylor getting in your face.</p>
<p>With Rhys Fulber's production and guiding hand, <i>Commitment</i> strikes the ideal balance between the visceral nature of their demo and the polish in their work since then. He's the perfect partner for them—he is best known for his time in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25056-front-line-assembly/"">Front Line Assembly</a>, a key influence on Youth Code, and with his production work with Fear Factory, he's well versed in finding the common space between industrial and guitar-based heavy music. They sound both more familiar to industrial audiences here and more like themselves. George and Taylor don't make a lot of alterations to their core sound, but Fulber allows the drum programming to strike harder and the electronics to creep longer, to feel more fulfilled even when Taylor is screaming about vulnerability and loss. They're hungrier than ever, and even with Fulber's assistance and a coveted co-sign from tourmates Skinny Puppy, <i>Commitment</i> is as much about “don't fuck with us” as it is “we've made it.”</p>
<p>Where <i>Commitment</i> really sets itself apart is that George and Taylor have embraced the moodier side of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_body_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EBM</a>, including quite a few tracks where they're not at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6795-negative-approach/"">Negative Approach</a> speed constantly. This direction was hinted at with “For I Am Cursed” from <i>Stand</i> and “Distorted Views” from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18592-youth-code-youth-code/"">self-titled</a>, and with Fulber's touch, the band embraces a melodic sense that was deep within them, but buried before in minimalism. It's a needed counterpart from the abundant intensity, and even so, Taylor rarely lets up. “The Dust of Fallen Rome” is one of the album's best tracks, chiefly for Taylor's performance, where she reaches beyond her hardcore scream and plumps new emotional depths. She sounds like she's both reaching for utopia and trying not to drown in hardcore purgatory. She reaches similar heights with “Doghead,” which has a groovier tempo—its fanciness makes for quite the contrast with Taylor ripping her soul apart. <i>Commitment</i> makes huge strides in its production, but it's Taylor who really pushes it ahead of their past works.</p>
<p>Metal and hardcore have been more spiritual influences on them than sonic. With “Shift of Dismay,” featuring guitar from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nails</a>' Todd Jones, the two sides meet at their most base level. When Taylor yells “Let the car crash” at those moments when Jones peaks, it's hard not to think of the cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2780-ministry/"">Ministry's</a> 1990 live record <a href=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51I8qGNCsoL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up</i></a>. Will <i>Commitment</i> cross over to metalheads and hardcore kids who may normally be averse to electronics? It should.</p></div>"|21732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21732-commitment-to-complications/|7.5|Andy O'Connor

<p>More justifiable causes for concern were Moreno’s claims that Deftones were making studio-intensive <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deftones-prep-heady-outside-the-box-new-album-20150310"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“heady, outside the box”</a> music, worrisome terms that could describe the various, underwhelming material he released with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11889-palms/"">Palms</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29851-artist/""><span>†</span><span>†</span><span>†</span></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4379-team-sleep/"">Team Sleep</a> since 2012's <i>Koi No Yokan</i>. It’s somewhat surprising that Deftones would want to dig their heels in after being in a groove: <i>Diamond Eyes</i> and <i>Koi No Yokan</i> are strong records, but a lot of the praise felt fueled by relief. <span>The band had proved capable of functioning after a devastating accident left founding bassist Chi Cheng in a coma until his death in 2013</span>, reemerging from their post-<i>White Pony</i> wilderness period with the ability to write hooks again, and their longevity had vindicated their relative critical acclaim and commercial failures compared to the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2327-korn/"">Korn</a> and Limp Bizkit. But their “return to form” felt a bit too literal, and for all of their attempts to distance themselves from nu-metal’s He-Mook posturing, <i>Koi No Yokan</i>’s “Tempest” still did a very convincing job of soundtracking an auto-erotic Vin Diesel montage in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or2ViI6iCoM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Furious 7</i></a>.</p>
<p>Moreno perhaps sensed they’d exhausted their decades-tested “five guys in a room” format and Deftones entered the studio with no written material and no real timetable. Rather than sapping them of their immediacy or energy, the protracted, Pro Tools-y composition of <i>Gore</i> ensured they didn't have to rely on old patterns or just <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/deftones-interview-with-chino-moreno-we-re-expanding-our-sound-were-not-making-adrenaline-or-white-a6974046.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">finish the damn record already</a>. Sound manipulator Frank Delgado reasserts himself on the most texturally luscious Deftones record yet, layering shakers, backmasking effects and dessicated vocal filters onto the shapeshifting bad trip “Acid Hologram”; while Jerry Cantrell dishes <i>Dirt</i> on the bluesy first half of “Phantom Bride”, Delgado pulls the coda down a black hole of grinding ambience. And while the maddening, math-rock rhythms of “Geometric Headdress” and “(L)MIRL” will push drummer Abe Cunningham to his physical limits in a live setting, the arrangements themselves clearly feel like the result of man-machine interplay.</p>
<p><span>There’s still plenty of the palpable tension between Moreno and Carpenter that drives Deftones records and sometimes derails them. But where previous records tended to isolate their conflicting desires i</span>nto separate songs or allot them to standard verse/chorus dynamics, both Moreno and Carpenter achieve a compelling standoff throughout <i>Gore</i>. “Hearts/Wires” was the song that prompted Carpenter’s red-flag-raising remarks, and it <i>does</i> recall a more shapely take on Moreno’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"">Isis</a>-featuring Palms project. Carpenter takes out his frustration on the rest of <i>Gore</i>, as the riffs on “Doomed User” and the title track hit with astonishing, almost atonal brute force. His work on <i>Gore</i> is equally reverent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2745-meshuggah/"">Meshuggah</a> and the ’80s iterations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden/"">Maiden</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"">Metallica</a>, a layering of black-, leather- and denim-metal similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21022-new-bermuda/""><i>New Bermuda</i>.</a> It's a flattering comparison that still manages to demonstrate Deftones' unique presence: they do this in the context of songs that could conceivably be played on rock radio.</p>
<p>Emphasis on<i> conceivably</i>, though<span>—</span><i>Gore</i> lacks a crossover shot as transcendent as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvknOXGPzCQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9COTgWZ9f44"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Change (In the House of Flies)""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmW_xuO24bI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Minerva""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tmPBuSpmfA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Digital Bath""</a>, but there’s a satsifying, nasty, seething edge to “Prayers/Triangles” and “Doomed User” that their post-Chi singles lacked. Still, <i>Gore</i> is easily Deftones’ most engaging record since <i>White Pony</i>, filled with carefully crafted hooks disguised as bridges and transitions; even the requisite, rangier late-album cuts aren’t subject to the drifting coo that Moreno relied on to fill out verses before the inevitable piledriving chorus.</p>
<p>If <i>Diamond Eyes</i> and <i>Koi No Yokan</i> were a vindication of Deftones’ formula, <i>Gore</i> captures the inimitable essence of the band: the thing that makes people reference them when discussing Deafheaven, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Ros</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18191-sigur-ros-kveikur/""><i>Kveikur</i></a> or basically any heavy rock album that strives to be prettier than its peers or vice versa, a truly new metal that’s sensual without resorting to shoegaze tropes, aggressive and unconventionally freaky in a way that never suggests predation or regressive machismo. Synaesthetically speaking, it’s a smear of pink, purple and black, a kiss that bites down on your lip to draw blood. By no means did Deftones invent the idea of combining brutality and beauty in metal, although they were definitely at least a decade ahead of the curve on covering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuNZGijfaZA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a>. Nothing short of a name change will likely convince skeptics at this point, but <i>Gore</i> proves that Deftones can remain vital as they are relevant, if they don’t kill each other first.</p></div>"|21547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21547-gore/|7.8|Ian Cohen

The record’s title gives away its m.o.; they were trying to imagine a music that was native to a place that didn’t exist. Hassell had a background in jazz, Indian music, and classical minimalism; Eno had a background in art rock and ambient music and using the recording studio as instrument. On <i>Fourth World</i> they took their interests in texture and unusual structures and created music that was hard to pigeonhole. You could draw lines from certain genres to individual elements, but the sound of the whole and the way it all came together felt unique to this project. <i>EARS</i>, the rich and rewarding new album from composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32669-kaitlyn-aurelia-smith/"">Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith</a>, owes some of its sound and more of its spirit to <i>Fourth World</i>: this is hard-to-pin-down music for the spaces in between.</p>
<p>Many of the warm, bubbling textures on <i>EARS</i> can be traced to Smith’s obsession with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9834-kaitlyn-aurelia-smiths-existential-synthesizer-music/"">a rare analog synthesizer by Buchla</a>, but the real secret of the album’s aesthetic owes more to the fact that it’s hard to make out the sources. In her hands, acoustic instruments sound like electronic ones, synthetic sounds reference nature, and human voices sound like the creation of machines. The defining characteristics of each instrument—in addition to analog synths, the album features woodwinds and flute from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31611-bitchin-bajas/"">Bitchin Bajas</a> member Rob Frye along with Smith’s singing—are turned inside out and re-defined, giving the record a pleasingly alien mood that also feels oddly familiar.</p>
<p>Smith is prolific and her Bandcamp has <a href=""https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nine releases</a>, many of which are quite good. But many of her earlier records are ""experimental"" in the most literal sense, where she gives herself certain limitations and parameters and sees what she can create within those strictures. <i>EARS</i> has more to offer as an album-length experience. And while this sort of ambient music is often associated with lengthy side-long compositions, Smith’s pieces are relative miniatures, mostly of pop-song length.</p>
<p>Each track it filled competing approaches that clash in delicate ways. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17951-kaitlyn-aurelia-smith-arthropoda/"">Arthropoda</a>"" is like a new age rainforest recording made on a distant planet, with buzzing insects and liquid gurgles, but it also sounds human, as Smith’s layered voice repeats an unidentifiable phrase with a deadpan insistence that brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a>. ""Wetlands"" finds Smith taking voice processing even further, as syllables blur into unearthly whooshes of noise that seems to be moving through a medium thicker than water. Tracks like ""First Flight"" have a more conventional spacey drift and these bring to mind the earlier synth music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, but Smith’s work never feels particularly referential. Even though many parts of this record sound like they could have been made in the ’70s or ’80s, you never get the sense that the technology is the point.</p>
<p>Though tracks are easy to distinguish by shifts in melody, they all work together as a sort of suite, and <i>EARS</i> almost feels like a concept album. For a technically sophisticated record that doesn’t have a great deal of dynamic range, <i>EARS</i> has a surprisingly strong emotional tug. Smith focuses on a narrow band of feeling—wonder, curiosity, disorientation, bliss—and constructs a gleaming sonic world to house them, a place where the lines between thoughts and feelings and styles are porous.</p></div>"|21562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21562-ears/|8.0|Mark Richardson

Over It.</a> album since he turned 30, the kind of milestone that throws some songwriters into crisis. It seems like it would be an especially hard transition for a guy whose very band name telegraphs his obsession with ephemerality, but to judge by these songs he’s doing fine, more or less. It’s everybody else around him that isn’t doing so well. For instance, ""Open Casket,"" a eulogy to youth, begins the record with a visit to some of Weiss’s old hometown friends and finds them much worse for the wear. ""They wake up still uninspired with no regrets,"" Weiss sings, ""Hung over and divorced/ They torch their twenties like it’s kerosene.""</p>
<p>Weiss has long been the spokesman for the emo revival, usually the most eloquent guy quoted in the ""Emo’s Back"" trend pieces that circulated a couple years ago. But now that the emo revival is looking less like a niche scene and more like the shape of alternative to come, Weiss is settling into a new role as the scene’s elder statesmen. He’s mellowed with age, and compared to the form-defying bands that have emerged since he first made his mark with the song-a-week project <i>52 Weeks</i> in the late ’00s, he sounds downright classicist. Weiss can’t match the genre-dwarfing ambition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31608-the-world-is-a-beautiful-place-i-am-no-longer-afra/"">The World is a Beautiful Place...</a>, the hyperventilating intensity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31939-the-hotelier/"">the Hotelier</a>, or the youthful insouciance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31933-modern-baseball/"">Modern Baseball</a>, and so he doesn’t try. Instead on <i>Standards</i> he banks on subtlety—which, really, is as good a way as any to distinguish yourself in a scene defined by overstatement.</p>
<p>As usual, Weiss doesn’t disguise his influences. The album’s pattering tones and corked time signatures reaffirm that this is someone who’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31778-theirtheyrethere/"">been in a band with Mike Kinsella</a> and could probably identify most of Polyvinyl’s classic releases by catalogue number. The influence that looms largest this time, however, is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"">Death Cab For Cutie</a>, and not just because Weiss leans more than ever on Ben Gibbard’s tender vocal affectations. As the band’s tightest, most approachable album, <i>Standards</i> feels like Into It. Over It.’s answer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18656-death-cab-for-cutie-transatlanticism/""><i>Transatlanticism</i></a>, a record that, while not quite a commercial crossover, feels like a trial run for one. <i>Standards</i> even has a mid-album slow-burner unabashedly modeled after <i>Transatlanticism</i>’s title track: ""Your Lasting Image,"" the achiest of Weiss's many ruminations about growing apart from the people he loved. When Weiss reaches the song’s climactic refrain ""I have the faintest recollection of us"" in concert you can almost imagine fans reflexively mouthing along ""I need you so much closer now"" by mistake.</p>
<p>After penning these songs in a cabin in Vermont, the previously Pro Tools-minded Weiss recorded <i>Standards</i> at analogue-enthusiast <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4452-john-vanderslice/"">John Vanderslice</a>’s Tiny Telephone Studio in San Francisco. Vanderslice’s production doesn’t have the crunch of some more modern-rock-leaning emo records, but it does have a richness and warmth that flatters Weiss’s songs. The fuzzed-out, curdled synths that send off ""Who You Are Does ≠ Where You Are"" deliver the record’s biggest sonic thrill, while the humming string accompaniments on ""Anesthetic"" make it prettiest song the band has ever recorded. Also flattering these songs: drummer Josh Sparks, a new addition to the band who already feels irreplaceable. His frolicsome drum work ties together the slow tracks together and lights up the fast ones. On the ripping ""Adult Contempt"" he’s essentially the lead instrument.</p>
<p>Sparks’ drumming is the showiest element on an album that’s mostly disinterested in showboating. What’ll be most surprising about <i>Standards </i>to anybody still weary of the emo tag is how tasteful it all sounds. In his many interviews on the subject, Weiss has sought not only to reclaim the term emo but also to normalize it, arguing in effect that it’s as just as respectable and ordinary as any other genre, and that for all its youthful appeal it’s the kind of music that you can grow old with, too. On <i>Standards</i>, a thoughtful album about bracing for the future while grieving the past, he’s leading by example.</p></div>"|21811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21811-standards/|7.0|Evan Rytlewski

After high school, Gallant moved from Columbia, Md., a sprawling suburb of Washington, D.C., to New York City to study music and launch his career. But Gallant’s music didn't pan out there for whatever reason, so he eventually moved to Los Angeles after he graduated, where his aerial-view R&amp;B had greater chances to be heard. Gallant soon caught the attention of Jake Udell, a business manager who helped catapult EDM artists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33227-zhu/"">ZHU</a> and Krewella to prominence.</p>
<p>In 2014, Gallant released an EP called <i>Zebra</i>, a moody affair on which the singer delved into his own anxieties and partially addressed his time in New York. The results were haunting, and you could feel the pressure Gallant was under to make a way on his own. New York’s pace is incredibly fast; Gallant’s music is made for wide-open spaces, to enter the room and spread out comfortably. There was undeniable talent on <i>Zebra</i>, but the singer’s vocals were somewhat recessive, his piercing falsetto hidden behind dense electronic layers.</p>
<p>Gallant’s voice is more pronounced on <i>Ology</i>, a sign that the singer is becoming more confident in his art and the personal stories he shares. His pain is still prevalent, his torment a strong inspirational source that remains for the album’s duration. There’s a sense of isolation in these songs, as if Gallant recorded them alone in the dark, with only his introspection pushing him toward something brighter. Gallant mines that despair for self-therapy; his cathartic wails echo through the stillness, arriving in sharp bursts. On ""Talking to Myself,"" for example, Gallant unveils hurt in the smoothest way possible, masking it behind a sultry R&amp;B groove. ""I’ve been whispering to ghosts lately,"" he sings over a stuttering melody. ""I’m begging for more time, before I’m buried deeper in the trenches of insanity.""  <span>Gallant’s lyrics are vast and ambiguous, taking tonal cues from </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a><span> while coming to grips with his own struggles. Gallant’s words read like diary entries on paper and sound mysterious on the album, unveiling pieces of his life without giving too much away. Gallant is a self-proclaimed introvert, so as a result, it's hard to get a sense of just who he’s supposed to be. His lyrics seem weightless, wafting throughout <i>Ology</i> without landing anywhere.</span></p>
<p>Gallant’s voice and the delicate way he contorts it, emulating ’80s and ’90s R&amp;B without taking too much from those eras, is easily his best attribute.  <i>Ology</i> recalls the great feelings of those genres, with subtle tinges of hip-hop and soul, leaving a nostalgic imprint. On ""Miyazaki,"" over a beat seemingly flown in from the early 2000s Soulquarians/Touch of Jazz period, Gallant reinterprets a line from Groove Theory's classic ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THtqUDitQ4I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tell Me</a>,"" his version giving off the same sweet vibe as the original.  On assertive ballads like ""Weight in Gold"" or ""Bone + Tissue,"" Gallant’s inflection is the clear focal point. On those tracks and others, Gallant's delivery takes precedence over what he's saying. His words come off poetically, and in its totality, <i>Ology</i> is a slow burn that grows more infectious as it plays. Gallant pivots adeptly between old and contemporary styles, landing on something all his own.</p></div>"|21770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21770-ology/|7.5|Marcus J. Moore

From 2012 to 2014, Rhedin released a handful of cassette- and vinyl-only EPs under the Dinner moniker, leading the generally fantastic indie-rock label Captured Tracks to sign him in 2014 and issue a compilation, <i>Three EPs: 2012-2014</i>. A tour with labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"">Mac DeMarco</a> followed.</p>
<p>It's less clear from this debut outing if Dinner has the tracks to match Rhedin's impressive trajectory.<i> Three EPs</i> was a relatively varied outing, as suits its cobbled-together origins, but it introduced Rhedin's darkly deadpan take on ’80s synth-pop like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4072-simple-minds/"">Simple Minds</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19331-psychedelic-furs/"">Psychedelic Furs</a>, complete with an alternate-universe novelty hit: the queasily catchy ""Going Out,"" which sneaks a tale of a druggy night on the town into what could be mistaken for an awkward invitation to go on a date (""Do you feel like going out tonight?""). <i>Three EP</i>s also presented Rhedin's unique vocal style, primarily a goofy baritone that must be how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2742-stephin-merritt/"">Stephin Merritt</a> sounds to people who don't like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2643-the-magnetic-fields/"">Magnetic Fields</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>Psychic Lovers</i>, Rhedin still sings like a failed Muppet auditioner, and layers more studio gloss on the new-wave noir template of ""Going Out,"" but without any song as modestly pleasant. Rhedin has billed the album as ""like sexual Christian rock ... but without all the Christianity,"" and, frankly, being asked to go out with him worked better when it wasn't really a come-on. Here, he's a ""normal guy"" longing for something to ""Turn Me On."" He wants ""What You Got."" He'd love to spend one night with you, because ""in your smile's a nuclear bomb,"" and you, person whose hips have ""oscillations"" as you walk down the street, own ""The World"" (""Every world belongs to you,"" to be more precise). The neon-glowing production is all just so, but the enjoyment we're supposed to get out of this lyrical mix of the portentous and the trite, and that gawky vocal delivery, in a world where <i>The Breakfast Club</i> and <i>Pretty in Pink</i> soundtracks have already existed for decades, with proper singing and catchy hooks and everything, isn't clear.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Psychic Lovers</i> does try out a few different hues within its fairly limited palette, but they mainly just add to the confusion. Sentimental slow-dance candidate ""Kali, Take Me Home"" showcases a children's choir and has a title that evokes the powerful Hindu goddess of creation and destruction. ""A.F.Y."" explores dubwise vocal effects and clanging distortion. ""Holy Fuck!"" languidly addresses not the sex, but the ""sexless fighting spells,"" imploring, ""Leave behind the lies."" Closer to the ’60s art-pop mode that occasionally surfaced on <i>Three EPs</i> is ""Lie,"" with its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>-like guitar strums and orchestral touches; there's a choral backing vocal here, too. ""Wake Up"" has a tropical-house flavor and describes, guess what, waking up in various locales ""with you.""</p>
<p>Rhedin's approach here theoretically could work. As the Nico comparison suggests, unconventional voices can turn out to be the most enduring, and even within the niche that critic Liz Colville once <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10384-lets-drag-our-feet/"">described on Pitchfork</a> as ""boys with perpetual colds who can kinda-sorta sing"" you can find overlooked nuggets from bands like Seattle's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11446-lately/"">BOAT</a> or Sweden's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9988-labrador-100-a-complete-history-of-popular-music/"">Suburban Kids With Biblical Names</a>.

Surely this shift explains something about the new M83 album, the fascinating and somewhat flummoxing <i>Junk</i>.</p>
<p>Based on <i>Junk</i>’s downright goofy first single, “Do It Try It,” there was some indication that Gonzalez might be pulling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/"">the classic move</a> in which a musician takes a hard left in reacting against the thing that made them famous. Since <i>Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming</i> was essentially the widescreen distillation of Gonzalez’s '80s neon dreams, it would make sense if a defiant about-face toward all things synthed and saxophoned might be in store. But <i>Junk</i> is not that. Instead, it’s as if Gonzalez is doggedly determined to mine those same nostalgic influences all over again, just in much more arcane ways. As a result, <i>Junk</i> is arguably the weirdest record he’s ever made, but it’s far from the best.</p>
<p>Those familiar with M83’s back catalog will hear familiar touchstones on <i>Junk</i>—lush synthscapes, collaged narratives, insouciantly spoken French—but anyone looking for another <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5cgzcjqOtE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Kim and Jessie”</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZnJciiFIYI&amp;nohtml5=False"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Teen Angst”</a> will be at a loss. The big pop moments here are centered around massive synth lines that could have been lifted off a Pointer Sisters record (“Laser Gun,” “Road Blaster”), or in the case of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18165-m83-go-ft-mai-lan-and-steve-vai/"">Go!</a>,” a gloriously wanky guitar solo courtesy of '80s axe god Steve Vai. Drafting Vai for a song that sounds like a tribute to songs that Vai <i>actually</i> played on gives the record a meta quality not unlike when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"">Lady Gaga</a> enlisted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29734-clarence-clemons/"">Clarence Clemons</a> for a sax solo on her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Springsteen</a>-worshipping “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeWBS0JBNzQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Edge of Glory</a>.” So although it’s an undeniable fist-pump of an anthem in a similar lane as “Midnight City,” “Go!” treads so close to total irony that it becomes difficult to swallow, in the process revealing one of <i>Junk</i>’s most consistent flaws. </p>
<p>This kind of pure homage to slick '70s and'’80s FM ephemera is so exacting in places, it almost makes you wonder: <i>What is the point of remaking this into something new? </i>That small voice grows louder when you hear the album’s instrumental tracks (“Moon Crystal,” “Tension,” “The Wizard”), where Gonzalez proves he can perfectly replicate the kind of incidental muzak that played in JCPenney dressing rooms circa 1983, or as the opening score of a “Too Close For Comfort” episode.</p>
<p>That is not to say that <i>Junk </i>is without its charms. “Road Blaster” is a pristine '80s mega-single that never was—a slick hybrid of synthesized horns and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29394-chic/"" target=""_blank"">Chic</a> guitars that sounds as if it were made specifically to soundtrack a late-night joy ride around Hollywood in an old sports car. “For The Kids” is a saxophone-soaked ballad featuring Norwegian singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30750-susanne-sundfr/"">Susanne Sundfør</a>, and it’s thoroughly gorgeous—until a voice-over from what sounds to be a ghost-child kicks in. </p>
<p>Gonzalez largely farms out vocal duties on <i>Junk</i>—like to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a> on “Time Wind,” a gently funky highlight from an imagined movie soundtrack—but the album’s best tracks feature his own voice. “Atlantique Sud” is a duet with Mai Lan Chapiron in which she and Gonzalez purr at each other in French, while “Solitude” features Gonzalez singing against a backdrop of strings that swell dramatically before eventually overpowering the song completely. The album closes with “Sunday Night 1987”—a song that serves as a tribute to the late Julia Brightly, a sound engineer with whom M83 had a long and devoted working relationship. Building on a somber piano melody reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8602-harold-budd/"">Harold Budd</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twin</a>’s <i>The Moon and the Melodies</i>, “Sunday Night 1987” is <i>Junk</i>’s most stunning song, and the one that most resembles early M83 albums. It’s also the only track on <i>Junk </i>that doesn’t sound like a showy exercise in a defunct style, though ending with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>-esque harmonica solo would come close if it didn’t provide an appropriately mournful final note.</p>
<p>It seems impossible that, seven albums in, Gonzalez doesn’t appreciate the possibly divisive nature of this album. You don’t call a record <i>Junk</i> and grace its cover with a couple of googly-eyed 21st-century <a href=""http://mcdonalds.wikia.com/wiki/Fry_Kids"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fry Kids</a> without having some inkling that you are taking the piss. In the album’s press materials, Gonzalez is quoted as saying, “I wanted to make what I call an ‘organized mess’—a collection of songs that aren’t made to live with each other, yet somehow work together.” It’s a commendable idea and one that <i>almost</i> works—collecting these various bits of cultural detritus and refashioning them into something that is at once compelling and potentially disposable. In the end, though, it’s that feeling of disposability that makes the album’s title resonate more pointedly in the wrong way.</p>

At its worst it feels like a tabloid-style ransacking of an archive. At its best it's a thoughtful and prodding collecting of memories—the ultimate memorial to a life in art. Most of the time it falls somewhere in the middle. We turn to the rough drafts of greats because they might offer hints of the magnum opus always on the horizon. And without the presence and guiding hand of the art’s creator, quality rests solely in the skill of curation and editing.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The 26th of this month will mark the two-year anniversary of Rashad Harden’s (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a>) passing, and in the 730 days since, the pulse of his legacy remains strong. Fifteen of Rashad’s previously unreleased collaborations have been compiled as <i>Afterlife</i>. The editors of the collection intelligently admit a fallibility in the face of the materials, and even offer a tantalizing hint of things still lurking in the vault, saying ""it would be impossible to present a definitive collection of DJ Rashad's music"" and that ""many many classics will remain unreleased for ever."" And like all posthumous art, <i>Afterlife</i> raises a very hard question: Does the trove of tracks significantly affect the ways we evaluate and interpret Rashad’s legacy? </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In short, the answer is no, and the fifteen songs in <i>Afterlife</i> all feel incomplete in some way or another. They match the mood and fervor you want from a Rashad track quite often, but it is hard to ignore their skeletal and fragmentary nature. Many of the songs feel like sonic bridges between tracks in a DJ set; they can ferry one moment to the next, but seem to lack the legs to stand on their own. And as befits an album cobbled together from unfinished stuff, you can see the stitching exposed. It doesn't have the same complete narrative push of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18627-dj-rashad-double-cup/""><i>Double Cup</i></a>, the concision of the<i> Rollin’ </i>EP. In composition it is closer to Rashad’s<i> Just a Taste, Vol. One</i>, a survey of work rather than an album perhaps.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Not to say that there aren’t highlights throughout. The opener, ""Roll Up that Loud"" is classic Rashad, ebullient from start to finish. It has the inimitable quality of a Rube Goldberg machine, with all the moving parts of the track whizzing back and forth. It's hard to know where artistic intentions and listener interpretations begin with posthumous work, but large chunks of this project reflect a surprising melancholy. This same feeling in Rashad’s work was most present in the<i> Rollin’ </i>EP, where high-speed funkiness was blended with a languorous mood. ""Oh God,"" one of the most simple songs here, is composed of a lone synth arpeggio and gentle drum patterning, and its tone is as plaintive as 160 BPM music can get. Rashad’s collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33245-dj-paypal/"">DJ Paypal</a>, ""Do U Wanna B Mine,"" meanwhile, counts as one of the odder songs Rashad had worked on. The melding of their two musical personalities leads into something that surprisingly sounds like earnest chiptune.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What <i>Afterlife</i> succeeds in above all is capturing the spirit of familial connection and experimentation integral to the Teklife crew. Teklife has always been a family affair. Not a single release from the collective has existed without collaboration. What made them so vital on stage and across blistering tracks was the ethic of teamwork. In all the times I’ve seen Rashad and the extended Teklife crew, I was witness to the exuberance of familial genius. The mixer was their hearth and they all took turns stoking the fire, whispering into each other’s ears, grinning because they all knew what five minutes into the future looked like: a mass of writhing bodies losing their shit in the face of something nearly ineffable. It was something I endlessly appreciated as a seventeen-year-old who had never even heard the whisper of a synth or the bump of a drum machine. To discover Teklife and Rashad then felt like walking across a mile of hot coals—throttled by the sheer force of realization at the other end.</p></div>"|21690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21690-afterlife/|7.2|Kevin Lozano

By 2010, success and expanding ambition started to strain against their underdog appeal. That tension was projected onto the anxious, thickly overdubbed <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13983-the-winter-of-mixed-drinks/"">The Winter of Mixed Drinks</a></i>. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17574-pedestrian-verse/"">Pedestrian Verse</a></i> arrived three years later, an album that isn’t widely considered their best, but it's definitive in its own way. It's the one that said “this is who we are going forward”: a major-label band that plays 2000-3000 cap rooms. Shortly thereafter, Hutchison moved to Los Angeles with his girlfriend. Sub in <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14203-high-violet/"">High Violet</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18030-the-national-trouble-will-find-me/"">Trouble Will Find Me</a></i> for their respective years, and this is basically the same exact career trajectory as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>, so it’s only natural that the two bands go from sharing tour bills and a producer (Peter Katis) to sharing a studio<span>—</span>and so with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7136-aaron-dessner/"">Aaron Dessner</a> behind the boards, <i>Painting of a Panic Attack </i>is more a sensible repositioning than a reinvention.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63289-frightened-rabbit-announce-new-album-painting-of-a-panic-attack-share-death-dream-plot-tour/"">“Death Dream”</a> immediately extinguishes any hope that Frightened Rabbit might return to the scrappy charms of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9715-sing-the-greys/"">Sing the Greys</a></i> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11351-midnight-organ-fight/"">The Midnight Organ Fight</a></i>. He often plays the religious skeptic in his lyrics, but Hutchison sure thinks piano sounds heavenly in a church; it’s hard not to think of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KehwyWmXr3U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Fake Empire”</a> just from the mere tone of the reverberant chord that opens “Death Dream.” By the time the progression begins to settle, it’s pretty much <i>impossible</i> to not hum “stay out...super late…tonight,” as the “Fake Empire” melody fits almost exactly. While it boasts Hutchison’s most vivid and morbid poetry yet, “Death Dreams” doesn’t lift off, floating more towards the rafters like a errant balloon. So it makes for a curious opener, though it’s an accurate preview of yet another instance where Dessner’s charges end up sounding like his main band.</p>
<p>This can work for a newer act that’s trying to hit a similar emotional tenor to the National. On their respective sophomore LPs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17537-hummingbird/"">Local Natives</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16233-tramp/"">Sharon Van Etten</a> followed raw debuts by contrasting Dessner’s sumptuous, solemn orchestration with simmering angst, the sound of people trying their best not to crack up in public. A band less willing to exert their own personality ends up with something like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20421-wilder-mind/"">Wilder Mind</a></i>. <i>Painting</i> is somewhere in between; Dessner helps add a silvery stylization to Frightened Rabbit’s jittery indie-folk on “Break,” while late-album ballads “400 Bones” and “Die Like a Rich Boy” cover Hutchison’s barstool laments with <a href=""https://www.rag-bone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rag &amp; Bone</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6p_qe45miY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sympathy</a>. The choral burst of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63907-frightened-rabbit-share-get-out-video/"">“Get Out”</a> is jarring in a strictly musical sense, more so if you once viewed Frightened Rabbit as an <i>alternative</i> to post-Britpop <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0666031/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patsavas-core</a> like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3853-snow-patrol/"">Snow Patrol</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4281-travis/"">Travis</a>. But ""Grey’s Anatomy"" is still chugging along and thus will need stadium-ready surges from a bearded man with a burly voice expressing an all-purpose longing about a flawed girl that won’t get out of his heart.  </p>
<p>They’re both effective, as formula should be, reliant on devices that become cliches only within their established parameters. After <i>The Midnight Organ Fight</i>, Hutchison joked that he couldn’t make another break-up record because he hadn’t had one that year. But it seems like he’s recognized that fans rely on Frightened Rabbit for a specific kind of Scottish miserablism, which <i>Painting of a Panic Attack</i> delivers with consistency if not conviction. They don’t strike me as cynical, so I’d hate to use the word “pandering” for the way <i>uber</i>-Frightened Rabbit laments “Blood Under the Bridge,” “An Otherwise Disappointing Life,” and “Woke Up Hurting” play towards expectations. But it’s really difficult to do otherwise after Hutchison’s expected recriminations of god, booze, and breakups tell you nothing the titles didn’t already, and the heavy-handed rhyming of “I Wish I Was Sober” only enhances the suspicion that it’s concept-driven exercise rather than an expression of actual emotion.</p>
<p>Yet, the best Frightened Rabbit songs aren’t entirely defined by their despondance or desperation. What’s missing from <i>Panic</i> is some kind of levity or the cutting humor that once personalized Hutchison’s self-loathing. It’s admittedly impossible to gauge the legitimacy of Hutchison’s emotions; like the National, maybe Frightened Rabbit have just gotten <i>too</i> good at their formula for it to not seem self-aware. And too often, the title of <i>Painting of a Panic Attack</i> serves as an unintentional reminder of the way Hutchison comes across: like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCEr4XbyLR8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a television version of a person with a broken heart.</a></p></div>"|21679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21679-painting-of-a-panic-attack/|6.0|Ian Cohen

Michelle</a> always entertains through the surprising experimentations in her music, promising something else is up her sleeve. On <i>More Issues Than Vogue</i>, Michelle's third album, the performer and musician delivers her most affecting, skillful, and innovative record yet. Diving deep into the best elements of traditional R&amp;B, sing-song pop, rap, and further out sounds, Michelle makes the best argument for herself as artist, and she succeeds. <span>The first few moments of standout track “If It Ain’t Love,” are, interestingly, K. Michelle’s attempt at country. This wouldn’t be her first turn in the genre. Originally hailing from Memphis, she has performed covers of country hits like Carrie Underwood’s “I Know You Won’t.” In early March, Michelle told <i>Essence</i> she’s currently pursuing her own country EP.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">“My ultimate goal is to be completely free and have freedom, which I think I’ve achieved,” she explained. “I’ve thought about ‘Oh, this will be my last album,’ but I really want to do the country EP.” Listeners also heard glimmers of this on 2014’s instantly memorable “God I Get It,” from <i>Anybody Wanna Buy a Heart?</i> and this trend continues on her latest.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">On “If It Ain’t Love,” she gives listeners a classic, addictive throwback love song filled with that country twang (in both the guitar and in Michelle’s peculiar intonation) that sounds immediately familiar upon the first listen. “It’s crazy, amazing, we fucked it up/ If it ain’t love, I don’t know what is,” she sings in the chorus. Laced with her signature fire, it is a moment that begs to be sung at the top of one’s lungs. Songs like “If It Ain’t Love,” effectively serve as a litmus test. Fueled with a beautiful melody, cinematic strings and chewable, universal lyrics, the track should (and hopefully) does translate to audiences who might not have heard of K. Michelle outside of ""Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta"" and<i> </i>""Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York,"" or even at all. It is that good.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Like on “If It Ain’t it Love,” Michelle surprises again on “Mindful.” Featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7337-t-pain/"">T-Pain</a>, the track is a too-short and perfect groove (it clocks in under two minutes) featuring the vocalist flexing her rap skills. “Who the fuck told y’all hoes to open up … I’m coming straight from the gut,” she spits, and that same rapid fire confidence pierces the track.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's a definitive statement both for the song and for Michelle as a performer. That ""freedom"" she spoke about earlier this year is here and real. Unafraid to push herself beyond the limitations and expectations of her as a creative, Michelle shines. She no longer asks that you take her seriously. Instead she demands it and rightfully so. It's now a matter as to whether or not audiences will come onboard. Hopefully they will. </p></div>"|21803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21803-more-issues-than-vogue/|7.9|Britt Julious

In the last six years, the Tuareg artist has continued to make inroads in the West, touring and recording Stateside, and his 2013 album <i>Nomad</i> found him in the studio with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"">Black Keys</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11618-dan-auerbach/"">Dan Auerbach</a>. And now, Longstreth’s early admiration has come full circle, as he was tapped to record Bombino’s latest, <i>Azel</i>, in upstate New York. The resulting record presents the guitarist in a lucid, unadorned light.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There’s no need to add too much to Bombino’s desert blues—his unassuming and astonishing playing speaks volumes on its own. Seeing him live, his left hand is deceptively fast, flicking off the strings and lighting upon extra notes that other players can’t quite hit. Much like fellow Tichumaren players <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5199-tinariwen/"">Tinariwen</a>, Bombino’s acumen blends techniques derived from ngoni (a traditional lute), the imzad (a one-stringed bow instrument), and the amplified guitar of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1923-jimi-hendrix/"">Hendrix</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24913-carlos-santana/"">Santana</a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Azel</i> isn’t so different from his unofficial first album for Sublime Frequencies, 2009’s <i>Guitars From Agadez Vol. 2</i>, which was recorded in his home country of Niger and intimate enough to capture the sounds of camels on one side and ragged stomping on the other. His gentleness comes through on “Igmayagh Dum (My Lover),” built from handclaps, thumped guitar body, and a nimble melody, with Bombino’s lines of love—sung in Tamasheq—delivered in a gentle purr. Meanwhile, his electric guitar prickles and the drums careen on “Timidiwa (Friendship).” There is one new wrinkle, though: a kind of fusion with reggae. That might sound corny on paper, but Bombino and his group keep it all low-key, and the sounds soon assimilate. Album centerpiece “Iyat Ninhay / Jaguar (A Great Desert I Saw)” is driven by a lilting bassline that leads into an incandescent solo from Bombino as trilling zaghrouta voices punctuate the ecstasy of the moment.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">But for all the guitar pyrotechnics, Western production, and reggae infusions, <i>Azel</i> never sounds like anything other than a sublime iteration of desert blues. Bombino has not pivoted towards Western music, as he still sings about the issues of his homeland in his native tongue. Hushed closer “Naqqim Dagh Timshar (We Are Left in This Abandoned Place)” tells of the plight of his people with a lines that translate to: “We sit in an abandoned place/ Everyone has left us/ The world has evolved/ And we’ve been abandoned.” Even with Bombino increasingly gaining exposure in America, lyrics like those remind us that his music continually speaks for those that would otherwise be unheard back home.</span></p></div>"|21693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21693-azel/|7.8|Andy Beta

""Facebook pages/ Boring boring!/ Rock'n'roll has got me snoring,"" he gasped over a skeleton of atonal guitar-noise, ultimately landing upon the most sacred of conclusions: ""Music! Matters! More than ever! Free your brain and conform never!"" Lucky for us, Parquet Courts have spent the past five years heeding their own call.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With <i>Human Performance</i>, their third proper album and first for London's legendary <a href=""http://www.roughtraderecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rough Trade Records</a>, Parquet Courts offer a fine testament to rock's continued power and relevance. They might mine the past for feedback and eccentricities, but their astute lyrics tackle the present head-on—co-songwriters Savage and Austin Brown write as if their songs might have real-world consequences. Parquet Courts emerged at a good time, when we yearn for something slightly more intellectual and aware and less about vibe—a longing that has spread into all areas of music culture. While not explicitly political, Parquet Courts are definitely a thinking band, and a critical one, which is equally important when the world is falling apart. Perhaps some of this sharpness comes from their roots in the DIY punk and hardcore underground with their previous bands, including <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsXtYDFfdrg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wiccans</a> and the criminally overlooked <a href=""https://teenagecoolkids.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Teenage Cool Kids</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At its best, <i>Human Performance</i> is Parquet Courts in a mellower, heart-stopping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20015-the-velvet-underground-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank""><i>Velvet Underground</i></a> mode, but it is also at turns upbeat and funny, sensitive and odd. Compositionally, these are the most dynamic Parquet Courts songs yet. You could no longer brush these guys off as mere <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5449-the-modern-lovers/"" target=""_blank"">Modern Lovers</a> rip-offs, as you might have around 2012's clangoring, whip-smart <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17405-light-up-gold/""><i>Light Up Gold</i></a>. <i>Human Performance </i>presents a more earnest, emotional side of the band. The record's bare, stunning closer ""It's Gonna Happen,"" penned by bassist Sean Yeaton and sung by Savage, recalls the heart-wrenching minimalism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>'s starry 2000 ballad <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQahAkaSpz4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Turning Time Around.""</a> And it's kind of touching to hear Brown—author of such genius dispatches as ""Socrates died in the fucking gutter!""—sing a simple, open love song like the wistful road ballad ""Steady On My Mind.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As ever, the fever-pitch of New York life is alive and fast-walking within these songs—zig-zagging the concrete to blaze past all the downward-gazing multitaskers too busy texting to get on where they're going. <i>Human Performance</i> captures the humor and horror of New York in 2016, alive with post-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcHnL7aS64Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cagean</a> street noise, with a faster-louder Ramonic ideal, with the erratic rhythm of train delays, a bus that never shows up, or the ""skull-shaking cadence of the J train rolls."" Something about Parquet Courts' intense-yet-witty existential energy reminds me of the legendary NYC tour-guide-cum-philosopher Speed Levitch (immortalized in '90s doc <a href=""https://vimeo.com/26259344"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Cruise</i></a>), who has long approached New York as if the city itself were an epic poem.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The sour rattle of <i>Human Performance</i>'s absurd and charmingly cartoonish opener ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17965-parquet-courts-dust/"">Dust</a>"" juxtaposes so many elements—jaunty piano riffs, discordant car honks, sweet organs—that you could imagine it soundtracking the opening sequence to a demented musical. ""Dust is everywhere/ Sweep,"" Brown taunts on loop, and it is not a stretch to hear the decrepitude as a metaphor for the finely-ground wreckage of Western civilization that we have all inherited. There is dread implied, but ""Dust"" mostly makes you laugh. Parquet Courts' take on New York life grows legitimately and rightfully severe on ""Two Dead Cops,"" a sobering and compact punk song that is literally about two cops who were murdered in Savage's Bed-Stuy neighborhood.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are songs on <i>Human Performance </i>that defy logic; they should not work and yet somehow, they do. <span class=""s1"">On the trudging, visceral centerpiece ""Captive of the Sun,"" the Beaumont, Tx.-bred Brown's rhythmic delivery is basically rapping. (He has <a href=""http://thetalkhouse.com/music/talks/austin-brown-talks-rap-book/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">written</a> at length about his intense personal connection to the ""outsider art"" that is Houston rap.)</span> Earlier, Sean Yeaton voices some city-fueled discontent with the stream-of-conscious curiosity ""I Was Just Here."" It takes on a classic New York dilemma—a jarring elegy for a Chinese restaurant that has recently closed much to his surprise and chagrin. ""You look so nice/ Chinese fried rice/ Wouldn't you know/ That place just closed,"" the band laments with an alien <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"" target=""_blank"">Devo</a> affect, in turn evoking the beloved underground punk-band-of-the-moment, Indiana's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33000-the-coneheads/"" target=""_blank"">Coneheads</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The latent weirdness of ""I Was Just Here"" reminds me of the time Savage wearily shouted-out the true freaks of Zappa's backing band, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-9FX7bhESs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Mothers of Invention</a>, in a cheeky Teenage Cool Kids song called <a href=""https://teenagecoolkids.bandcamp.com/track/beg-to-differ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beg to Differ.""</a> In fact, there are several moments on <i>Human Performance</i> that recall Teenage Cool Kids' 2011 cult hit <a href=""https://teenagecoolkids.bandcamp.com/album/denton-after-sunset"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Denton After Sunset</i></a> (in which Savage romanticized Texas in a way to rival <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6649-john-darnielle/"">John Darnielle</a>). In some of <i>Human Performance</i>'s best songs—like ""Berlin Got Blurry,"" with its winding Spaghetti Western riff and wandering spirit—there's a bright directness he hasn't shown since back then. <i>Denton After Sunset</i> was a love letter of sorts to the place Savage came from; it showed his adept understanding of the evocative power of geography, something he's carried into his New York songbook.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Alongside the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31640-courtney-barnett/"" target=""_blank"">Courtney Barnett</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/"" target=""_blank"">Sadie Dupuis</a>, Savage remains one of the best rock lyricists of his generation. In the past, he has written philosophical punk songs about cats, candy, and existence; about Stalinist art and opera. Here, he cuts inward, clawing further into his own soul. It's in the arresting one-two punch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18162-parquet-courts-human-performance/"" target=""_blank"">""Human Performance""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18123-parquet-courts-outside/"" target=""_blank"">""Outside"" </a>that Savage's writing shines most elegantly. These are break-up songs, for sure, but sometimes it's hard to tell if Savage is breaking up with a lover or with himself. At the core of the soulful ""Human Performance"" is a difficult, messy question: <i>Am I good person, or am I fooling everyone, including myself?</i> Savage's tender ruminations on love and loneliness are deeply self-critical: ""I told you I loved you/ Did I even deserve it? When you returned it,"" he croons, sounding like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Dylan</a> circa <i>Nashville Skyline</i>. The layered feel of the track's chorus reminds me of the ""multi-latch gating"" technique that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9272-tony-visconti/"" target=""_blank"">Tony Visconti</a> used to produce <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBuwC4VJi50"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heroes""</a>—each time Savage screams, the echoes sound further away, more unhinged and desperate, tempered by lovely organ lines and jazzy drum patterns.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The sub-two-minute ""Outside"" follows, and it is the sunniest, snappiest Parquet Courts tune ever—a song about admission, about accepting your flaws and finding peace. For such a short song it is impossibly beautiful. ""Dear everything I've harmed/ My fault lies on my tongue/ And I take it holy as a last rite,"" Savage sings, his voice shining with palpable abandon and relief, a kind you only get from telling the truth. ""Outside"" is ultimately about turning honesty and imperfection into virtues, and that purity is doubled by its indelible melody. Little details, like a lopsided beat and an endearing note sung flat, only serve to deepen it.</p>
<p><i>Human Performance</i> is a bracing snapshot of a band on a roll. As punk turns 40 on both sides of the Atlantic this year, it's fitting that this record is out on Rough Trade—that era's arty, leftist wing of outsiders-among-outsiders. You'd be hard pressed to find a contemporary rock band honoring the classic Rough Trade legacy as well as Parquet Courts, in both sound and spirit, while doing something audacious and new. In a sense, they even revive Rough Trade's O.G. connection to eccentric Texas psych-rock, from back when conceptual artist Mayo Thompson of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3541-the-red-krayola/"" target=""_blank"">the Red Krayola</a> was the label's heady spokesperson, producing crucial records by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3517-the-raincoats/"" target=""_blank"">the Raincoats</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"" target=""_blank"">the Fall</a>, and collaborating with members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3284-pere-ubu/"" target=""_blank"">Pere Ubu</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4016-swell-maps/"" target=""_blank"">Swell Maps</a>. Parquet Courts deserve to be discussed within this lineage. Intelligence is addictive, and there is accordingly a quiet mania to Parquet Courts fandom that matches that of their forebears. On <i>Human Performance</i>, Parquet Courts send a generation-skewing message that avails not, time nor place: it is cool to really think.</p></div>"|21597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21597-human-performance/|8.4|Jenn Pelly

However, unlike the previous works the Scottish post-rock innovators have scored (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9617-zidane-a-21st-century-portrait-ost/"">Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait</a>, The Fountain</i>, and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17764-les-revenants/"">Les Revenants</a>"") the source material doesn’t have a clear-cut narrative<i>. </i>With no outside narration or interviews to provide context to the film's archival cortège (save a series of statistics at the conclusion), director Mark Cousins takes a bold risk and assumes the audience's familiarity with everything mentioned in ""We Didn't Start the Fire."" It's more an obtuse high-art music video than it is a traditional documentary. <i>Atomic</i>, on the other hand, is anything but esoteric. Despite its minimalistic approach, the album poignantly illustrates the binary oppositions that cropped up in Hiroshima’s wake: life and death, hope and fear, war and peace, atomic and organic.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mogwai have always thrived on textural contrast: the fission of twangy strings against somber snare hits, the disintegration of brittle synthesizers beneath a tide of feedback, a violin crying out in silence. In keeping with the film’s themes, several tracks on <i>Atomic </i>sound corrupted. Beneath the uplifting fanfare of opening track ""Ether,"" for instance, one can hear a faint, dull drone, as though the band recorded the track on nuked recording equipment. The unsettling murmur continues throughout the entire record, and even in moments of rare purity—such as the tender duet of guitars and violin on ""Are You A Dancer?""—the mechanical roar is never far behind. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The majority of the album distances itself from rock and sticks to</span> a doom-ridden breed of new-wave. ""SCRAM"" sees the group sequencing a stream of staggered synth lines into hypnotic orbit, like a Cold War Calder mobile, while ""Weak Force"" resembles a piano ballad performed by a forlorn android. The record’s final track, ""Fat Man,"" is the most methodical and magnificent by far. The band take a lone, unassuming piano riff and bombard it with sharp guitar tones, the corruption further catalyzed with steadily-increasing doses of the aforementioned aural radioactivity; there’s a cinematic swell, and then... silence. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Considering the conditions of <i>Atomic</i>'s conception, the album’s departure from the band’s preceding full-length, 2014’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18896-mogwai-rave-tapes/"">Rave Tapes</a>, </i>shouldn’t come as a surprise. Sure, fans expecting a Stuart Braithwaite shred-fest may find the LP a disappointment. But like all good concept albums (and soundtracks), <i>Atomic</i>’s sole allegiance is to its subject. And when you’re dealing with the pinnacle of human innovation <i>and </i>the symbol of death, that subject deserves to take center stage.</p></div>"|21748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21748-atomic/|7.1|Zoe Camp

The results were <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/""><i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i></a><i> </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21705-untitled-unmastered/""><i>untitled and unmastered.</i></a>, both expansive and intricate, scanning the vast spectrum of Black art. Multi-instrumentalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33582-terrace-martin/"">Terrace Martin</a> was a binding agent for both albums: He co-produced what might be <i>untitled</i>’s best track—“<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18072-kendrick-lamar-untitled-05-09212014/"">untitled 05</a>”—playing saxophone and keys, and his name appeared several times in <i>Butterfly</i>’s liner notes, credited for producing “For Free? (Interlude)” and adding elements to many other album tracks. (He produced “Real” on Lamar’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/"">good kid, m.A.A.d. city</a></i> as well.) Along with Sounwave, bassist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a>, keyboardist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32926-robert-glasper-trio/"">Robert Glasper</a> and saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20557-the-epic/"">Kamasi Washington</a>, Martin played a big role in shaping <i>Butterfly</i>’s atmospheric approach, the way it spread out in different directions without losing focus. Though it addressed societal despair and Lamar’s own angst, <i>Butterfly</i> was also a love letter to Compton and the West Coast in general, its wide-open funk and soul a direct reflection of Cali’s pastoral grooves.</p>
<p>Martin takes a similar path on <i>Velvet Portraits</i>, which pulls in R&amp;B and G-funk while paying homage to his native Los Angeles. The multifaceted ethos has become useful for the composer, whose music never stays in the same place for too long, while maintaining its breezy spirit. Martin has crafted instrumentals for Snoop, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27914-kurupt/"">Kurupt</a> and Murs over the years, and his debut studio album, 2013’s <i>3ChordFold</i>, mixed live instruments and studio beats with refreshing results. <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2016/01/20/terrace-martin-hip-hop-jazz-producer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In an interview with <i>The Fader</i></a>, Martin said <i>Velvet Portraits</i> was headed a different way until a mix of family emergencies encouraged him to take another tack. “We went through all these things and it made me want to pull closer with myself, and it really made me want to pull closer with God,” he said at the time. That’s why <i>Velvet</i> feels remarkably scenic, moving methodically and conjuring pastoral scenes. Technically, this is jazz, but the tag is almost a disservice here: Sure it has some of the genre’s traditional aspects—the improvised nature of “Curly Martin” and the Sérgio Mendes aesthetic of “Bromali” are examples—but the album registers as something deeper without a clear definition. This is jazz the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32926-robert-glasper-trio/"">Glasper</a> is jazz, the way <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14623-bitches-brew-legacy-edition/"">Bitches Brew</a></i> is a jazz record: Martin mixes pieces of the genre with others, setting a vibe that’s uniquely his.</p>
<p><i>Velvet Portraits</i> is full of subtle shifts that make the album tough to pin down, even if the individual tracks are easily deciphered at first glance. Songs like “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18153-terrace-martin-push/"">Push</a>” and “Patiently Waiting” have pronounced gospel influences—the former an upbeat revival tune; the latter reminiscent of the church-soul hybrids <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8317-ray-charles/"">Ray Charles</a> used to make. <i>Velvet Portraits</i> is decidedly nostalgic in that regard, and as it plays, you sense Martin’s allegiance to old-school music and the way it made him feel. It’s in the trunk-rattling bounce of  “Turkey Taco” and the Quiet Storm ambience of “Never Enough.” On “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18085-terrace-martin-think-of-you/"">Think of You</a>,” especially, singer Rose Gold salutes soul icons <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a> while Kamasi’s sax simmers in the background.</p>
<p>In many ways, <i>Velvet Portraits </i>is <i>Butterfly</i>’s companion piece, harboring the same voluminous reach while conveying uplifting messages of love and inclusiveness, resting in the heart of southern California. Where Martin’s previous work was more energetic, <i>Velvet </i>seems far more relaxed, as if he’s found a creative lane and is fully comfortable in it. The album doesn’t hit as hard as the producer’s other offerings, but on purpose, <i>Velvet Portraits</i> is a soft touch that slowly unfolds over time, best heard under bright skies, on spring and summer evenings with the car windows down. It all culminates on ""Mortal Man,"" the album's epic closer, which takes from <i>Butterfly</i>'s closer of the same name. Sprawling almost 12 minutes, Martin's version is theatrical, full of synthesized vocals and sporadic horns. Light keys bubble to the surface, bringing the LP to a radiant conclusion. It doesn’t get more L.A. than that.</p></div>"|21767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21767-velvet-portraits/|7.8|Marcus J. Moore

It's typical for the Seattle four-piece, who mix songs about their love of pop culture—they just did the theme to the ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62986-tacocat-do-the-new-powerpuff-girls-theme/"">Powerpuff Girls</a>"" reboot—with tirades about periods, pervs, and the patriarchy. Released in 2014, Tacocat's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19049-tacocat-nvm/""><i>NVM</i></a> riffed on IM slang for ""never mind,"" a reference to the city's most <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">famous sons</a>, and essentially mocked how far we'd veered from Kurt Cobain's <a href=""https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/02/20/kurt-cobain-journals/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">future-female ideals</a>. Its vibrant spirit ran on the kind of energy you'd only otherwise get from chugging a giant sports drink before egging someone's house.</p>
<p><i>Lost Time</i> (another ""X-Files"" <a href=""http://x-files.wikia.com/wiki/Time_loss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reference</a>) delves into some of the same subject matter. ""FDP"" is an SOS from the first day of lead singer Emily Nokes' period, ""Plan A, Plan B"" mocks the wrongheaded GOP idea that women use the morning-after pill as contraceptive, and ""Talk"" sounds a little like fellow Pacific Northwester <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4517-laura-veirs/"">Laura Veirs</a> reincarnated as a frustrated millennial, wishing she and her friends would ditch their iPhones for living room dance parties. ""Men Explain Things to Me"" takes its name from the <a href=""https://www.guernicamag.com/daily/rebecca-solnit-men-explain-things-to-me/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca Solnit essay</a> that popularized the term ""mansplaining."" ""Though I know all about the words you're spitting out, the floor is yours without a doubt,"" Nokes sings, her typically sharp tongue cutting some blowhard down to size.</p>
<p>They also widen the net, in terms of inspiration. ""I Love Seattle"" references ""<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Really Big One</a>,"" a <i>New Yorker</i> article about the earthquake that will destroy much of the coastal Northwest. There's nowhere else they'd rather be, but admit, ""at least no-one's pretending like that would even be bad."" The highlight of <i>Lost Time</i> is ""I Hate the Weekend,"" which explains their ambivalence about Seattle falling into the Pacific. In a melody <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6113-jenny-lewis/"">Jenny Lewis</a> wouldn't be ashamed to stick on her recent records, Nokes paints an incisive portrait of how tech bros haven't just whitewashed the city's thriving culture (""paint the rainbow shades of beige""), but terrorize the streets when they ""cut loose"" at weekends. ""Got a hall pass from your job just to act like a fucking slob,"" they sing, filled with catchy disdain.</p>
<div dir=""ltr"">And that kind of fire is what <i>Lost Time</i> sorely needs more of. There's no question that many of <i>Lost Time</i>'s lyrics are funny, but the attitude that fueled <i>NVM</i> feels crushed. In both the vocal delivery and the driving guitars, the vibe is damper, the color somewhat drained. Sometimes the fruit hangs a little low: ""The Internet"" is a straight-strummer about trolls. With that in mind, it's unsurprising that the peppier songs here are the ones about the things you do for pleasure and pleasure alone. <i>Lost Time</i>'s most inventive song, ""Horse Grrls,"" is a fully enthused stop-start shredder about equestrian obsessives: ""They know the different breeds of all their favorite steeds!"" And ""Night Swimming,"" too, is lovely—a splashy, beatific jam about breaking into a lake at night, where the only rule is, ""You can bring a boombox, but you can't play <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-YHU6BwPR0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M.</a>"" The final song, ""Leisure Bees,"" is ambitious and engaging, shifting between Beach Boys-indebted harmonies, girl-group coos, and shaggy nostalgic jams.</div>
<p>It makes sense that the record starts with an ode to Scully, whose artful eye-rolls have become the internet's <a href=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b0/06/f6/b006f6b64504d5e6a81682c19cea2a80.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">go-to meme</a> in the face of the men who plague your @-replies. Tacocat have always approached feminism from a point of fun rather than anger, but inevitably, when bros keep bro-ing and your city's falling apart, and nothing ever seems to change, it's gonna get hard to see the funny side.

Morphing into Träd, Gräs och Stenar  in 1969, they became a full-fledged rock band, with most of the artier experimentation stripped away in favor of lengthy, guitar-heavy jams. But the group’s extended, open-ended playing still carried the spirit of Riley’s “all-night flights.” Their songs might not have sounded like </span><span><i>In C</i>, </span><span>but they could be just as expansive, indeterminant, and mind-blowing.</span></p>

The visibility ended just a few feet in front of your nose; the shapes of other people drifted past while the haze <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOJz0eSYGiQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pulsed</a> in deep shades of red and blue and lavender. The music was a soup of drones, and the sound, the visuals, and the space itself blended together in such a way that you felt a little like you were floating in space.</p>
<p>The event in question was Ephemera, a site-specific collaboration between the Canadian electronic musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a>, German visual artist Marcel Weber, a.k.a. MFO, and Geza Schoen. While the audiovisual experience at most concerts rarely rises above the level of a laser light show, what made this performance-slash-installation so successful was not only its immersive, experiential quality; to longtime fans of Hecker's work, it was an act of transmutation, drawing out qualities that were latent in Hecker's music and bringing them to life around you, in four dimensions. </p>
<p>Over 15 years and multiple solo albums, Hecker has built up a formidable vocabulary of scrape and shimmer and crackle and throb. Using guitar, piano, organ, and, primarily, scads of digital processing, he treats sound as a plastic object, something physical to be molded and stretched. His work is sculptural in feel and widescreen in scope, and it is extraordinarily attentive to texture. Foremost among his concerns has been the idea of diffuseness, of dissolution. There are few hard edges, few identifiable motifs; musical events, like a shift in tone or the introduction of a new timbre, often take place under the cover of static. He prefers distant shapes with vague outlines.</p>
<p>Some of that fog burns off on <i>Love Streams</i>, an album that marks a subtle shift in Hecker's habitual style, a pivot away from his hazy trademark. ""What do you do when you're known for making a certain type of work?"" he recently asked, rhetorically, in an interview with <i><a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2016/03/30/tim-hecker-interview-love-streams"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Fader</a></i>. Feeling like he was beginning to repeat himself, he said, he decided that the solution ""was not stacking things louder and heavier but working in a different way."" That meant working with voices, for one thing—a complicated-sounding process of using software to translate medieval choral music to digital synthesis and then, working with Icelandic composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2199-johann-johannsson/"">Jóhann Jóhannsson</a>, to write and record complementary new choral parts.</p>
<p>He treats his voices in the same way he has typically treated instruments like piano and organ—that is to say, attacking them as if with steel wool—but they're still recognizable as voices. On ""Violet Monumental I,"" a chattering soprano sings an abstracted lamentation that feels almost liturgical, and on ""Music of the Air,"" disconnected bursts of voice are staggered in time and spread across the stereo field, lending the impression of wandering through a choir pit while the singers warm up. 4AD turns out to be the perfect home for Hecker's new album, given the way it faintly echoes the choral fixations of '80s 4AD staples like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1030-dead-can-dance/"">Dead Can Dance</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a>, and Le Mystère Des Voix Bulgares. </p>
<p>Hecker's palette has evolved in other ways, too. ""Obsidian Counterpoint"" opens the album with a blippy stream of arpeggios, an explicitly electronic sound that is unusual for his work. Throughout, his sounds seem tugged in two directions at once, as though caught between the digital and the physical. In ""Music of the Air,"" a buzzing, droning synthesizer patch bobs in unpredictable motions like a handful of jewel-colored flies. Toward the end of ""Bijie Dream,"" a harpsichord-like sound mutates into something resembling a steel pan, a far cry from Hecker's typically Arctic-inspired palette.</p>
<p>These bold, declarative sounds—which also include the bleating bass clarinet of ""Violet Monumental II"" and the guitar-like riffing of ""Voice Crack""—cut strong shapes through the murk, but Hecker's compositional sensibilities remain opaque: He traffics not so much in melodies or song forms as in unsteady tone clusters. There's not a lot of forward motion here; motifs and timbres repeat across the record, and while many tracks flow seamlessly from one to the next, his open-ended constructions give the album a rewardingly meandering feel. Not a lot <i>happens</i>, except when it does: In the final minute of ""Collapse Sonata,"" there might be more dynamic action, as tolling bells are gradually absorbed into a queasy slick of steel drum, digital distortion, and dissonant organ tones, than there is on the rest of the album put together.</p>
<p>It's a setup for ""Black Phase,"" a dramatic conclusion that pairs somber choral harmonies with the gravelly guitars of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5924-ben-frost/"">Ben Frost</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>. It's as diffuse as the rest of the record, yet it feels somehow cathartic. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18559-tim-hecker-virgins/""><i>Virgins</i></a>, <i>Love Streams</i> tackles a lot of abstract concepts, like ""live"" sound, and synthetic sound, and rooms and space, and technology's ability to complicate all those things. But it's also about the ability to disappear into sound, to get lost in the contours of a slippery timbre, or to be made whole by a consonant harmony. At its close, those staccato vocal parts and that smoldering low end deliver a real emotional punch, the release to subtle tensions that have been building up throughout the course of the record's hazy, unpredictable run. It's a suggestion that, if you stumble around in the fog long enough, you might just find what you're looking for.</p></div>"|21635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21635-love-streams/|8.2|Philip Sherburne

They didn’t lose sleep after sabotaging their own record deal, and they sure didn’t mind selling thousands of tickets for concerts they never intended on playing in the first place. By any reasonable standard, this band doesn’t give a shit. So it’s been surprising that, in recent months, Death Grips have actually shown generosity to their fans, punctuating the interim between proper albums with low-stakes instrumental work.</p>
<p>In the opening weeks of 2015, the band preceded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20451-jenny-death/""><i>Jenny Death </i></a> with a full-length “soundtrack“ titled <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20102-fashion-week/"">Fashion Week</a>. </i>At roughly 48 minutes (the second-longest runtime in Death Grips’ catalog after <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15583-exmilitary/"">Exmilitary</a>)</i>, it certainly had the bulk of a typical album, but the absence of frontman MC Ride, their furious heart and anguished soul, ultimately rendered <i>Fashion Week</i> unnecessary. And now, just prior to the release of their next album, <i>Bottomless Pit</i>, comes another unusual instrumental release: “Interview 2016,” a 32-minute clip that depicts the band playing for actor/TV host Matthew Hoffman in a darkened room before sitting down for a conversation. Had the band not legitimized the soundtrack by uploading it to SoundCloud (and later, other streaming sites), the release would probably be written off as a curio, rather than an entry in the Death Grips canon. Now that it’s isolated, we can see <i>Interview 2016</i> for what really is: an instrumental EP that abandons <i>Fashion Week</i>’s uneventful expanses for a cramped space that shows Death Grips in confrontational mode.</p>
<p>As with the last soundtrack, MC Ride’s absence diminishes <i>Interview</i>’s intensity, but its brevity gives them space to compensate, narrowing the focus for a sharper sound. Other than the ambient interlude “Interview E,” the EP mainly sees <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6364-zach-hill/"">Zach Hill</a> and Andy Morin doubling down on <i>Jenny Death</i>’s unhinged hardcore with a proliferation of over-driven drums and basslines that seem as if they’re fired from from a Gatling gun. And even though there’s not a clear human voice in the mix (save from a quick “Hi Everybody!” in “Interview F”), the instruments do plenty of talking. Listen closely to the slippery percussive sample smattered across “Interview C,” or the barking undercurrent of “Interview F:” the effects themselves are undeniably alien, but they still manage to communicate.</p>
<p>The dynamic and varied arrangements keep the EP from slipping into a formlessness; “Interview B,” the standout of the set, periodically diverts to an eerie, faintly Eastern chorus that pops open suddenly like a trap-door into the void. And lest the din grow dull on punishing cuts like “Interview A” and “Interview D,“ Hill and Morin temper the racket ever-so-slightly through silvery, distant-sounding refrains that comfort even as they contort, like possessed library music. They even transmogrify Hill’s drum fills into an arpeggiating melody on “Interview C.”</p>
<p>While MC Ride might be perceived as the alpha and omega of Death Grips, <i>Interview 2016</i> underscores that Hill and Morin are quite formidable on their own. This release is far more interesting than <i>Fashion Week, </i>a full-length twice its size, and it suggests that Death Grips' strength as an instrumental entity shouldn’t be underestimated. </p></div>"|21796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21796-interview-2016/|7.0|Zoe Camp

The band answers that question before anybody can ask it on <i>City Sun Eater in the River of Light</i>, which opens with the most surprising departure of their entire discography: “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17914-woods-sun-city-creeps/"">Sun City Creeps</a>,” a detour into reggae and African jazz, complete with island horns, trebly guitars and the loose, first-take feel of an early Studio One session. It’s a knockout song, even before the pace quickens during its jammy payoff stretch, yet the group adopts these tropical sounds so naturally that it never feels like they’re showing off. You can count on one hand the number of American rock bands that could tastefully pull off this sort of stylistic gambit—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/650-calexico/"">Calexico</a>; maybe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"">My Morning Jacket</a>. Turns out Woods is one of them.<br/> <br/> An opener like that stirs real excitement, and the assurance that the band hasn’t grown complacent is particularly well-timed, coming as it does after 2014’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19205-woods-with-light-and-with-love/"">With Light and With Love</a></i>, a characteristically enjoyable but familiar-on-arrival LP that left even many Woods loyalists longing for a shakeup. To be sure, <i>City Sun Eater </i>isn’t a complete reinvention, either—it’s largely rooted in the same '60s pop and druggy Americana that’s defined all the band's records—but periodic shadings of reggae give the record a character of its own. Dubby organs lead “Can’t See At All,” which breathes like a classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"">Lee Perry</a> track. Some moaning backing vocals are tracked so closely they sound like a wailing electronic gizmo, exactly the kind of lo-fi studio trickery that dub producers played with on their early efforts. Stately horns add gravity to the bongo-guided “The Take,” another number that patiently builds to a tweaked-out climax.<br/> <br/> All of those tracks work because they’re never played as straight genre experiments; they all sound first and foremost like Woods songs, even when they draw from a different vocabulary than any that came before. And like all of Woods’ recent albums, <i>City Sun Eater</i> is generously packed with pop songs, too. With its delirious wah-wah guitars, closer “Hollow Home” imagines what a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8391-george-harrison/"">George Harrison</a> cover of “Just Like Heaven” might have sounded like (utterly joyous, as expected). The song most guaranteed to make audiences twirl in the mud at their live shows, “Politics of Free” pairs the album’s pluckiest guitars and cheeriest tempo with a parade of uplifting aphorisms: “Find the time to separate your work life from relief/ Constellations in the summer sky/ In a world of shit/ Let’s tune out.” <br/> <br/> For most acts, “Politics” would be the clear single, but Woods have never been much of a singles band. They don’t have much to gain from them, since singer Jeremy Earl’s thin voice still makes them a hard sell for wider audiences. On the group's scrappy early efforts it was easy to write off that untrained voice as part of the group’s rumpled charm, but as their albums have grown more deliberate, his anemic falsetto has become more of a nuisance—it’s the only one-note instrument in an act that otherwise wrings so much nuance out of all the other ones. Nine albums in, Woods are still turning out great tunes while tapping new muses, and that’s worth celebrating. But how great would it be if they had a singer who could really do them justice?</p></div>"|21750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21750-city-sun-eater-in-the-river-of-light/|7.6|Evan Rytlewski

In an interview about the group's inspiration with <a href=""http://flaunt.com/music/big-sean-and-jene-aiko-announce-twenty88/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flaunt</a>, Aiko said, ""It's a '70s aesthetic, but we're in the future,"" citing the A.I. psychological thriller<i> Ex Machina</i> as an inspiration. What materialized was an album of sex jams about dysfunctional relationships, which begs the question, what exactly do they think <i>Ex Machina</i> is about? Nonetheless, it makes sense that Sean would see his reflection in the shiny metal alloy of a sci-fi flick since his raps are often mechanically engineered—setup, setup, punchline, repeat. But on <i>Twenty88</i>, he is about as human-sounding as he's ever been, thanks in large part to Aiko.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a pair, Aiko and Sean complement each other well; the former once called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> her ""musical soulmate,"" but that distinction is probably better suited here. The L.A. singer-songwriter has a mewing voice that nestles just into the casing of her rap counterpart's cadences. They pen verses in a similar fashion, too, curt and to the point, usually only rendering love interests as incomplete sketches; her method is to vilify and his is to write around his subject, but they are usually on the opposite end of the same conclusion: I'm right. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""> This is most evident on ""Selfish,"" where they take turns putting the blame on one another, trading accusations over stringy guitar licks that loop through skipping production. The KeY Wane, Amaire Johnson, and Cam O'bi-produced opener, ""Deja Vu,"" finds the two viewing a shared past through different lenses. This is why, when it's connecting, their collaboration works: it turns two self-centered POVs into a whole.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In that way, the album is a logical extension of the other Sean-Aiko collaborations—""Beware"" from <i>Hall of Fame</i> and ""I Know"" from last year's marginally better <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20220-dark-sky-paradise/""><i>Dark Sky Paradise</i></a>. But on those songs, Jhené Aiko stayed mostly in the margins. The idea here is to juxtapose male and female perspectives, not with the hope of finding some type of balance or a middle ground, but simply to see that both voices are equally represented, and when one of them isn't spouting cliches (""What's the difference between real love and fake love/ The same difference between real titties and fake ones/ You can feel the difference,"" from ""Talk Show"") it's fully functional.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Big Sean is still fully capable of reverting back to old bad habits, and on <i>Twenty88</i>, he bring his fair share of clunkers (""You know that year you said I lost my marbles""/ Well I guess I turned them all to marble floors,"" on ""Memories Faded""; ""You the real real, no GMO,"" on ""2 Minute Warning""). He's prone to rambling, will drag schemes out too long, and he isn't afraid to overcommit. But he strings together enough solid stretches to keep tracks moving. Still, Aiko is often the saving grace, holding songs together and delivering the better verses. She sells all of the longing on ""On the Way,"" which writhes in carnal anticipation. Her warm harmonies melt into the backdrop of the thrusting ""Push It."" On ""2 Minute Warning,"" she forms a chorus with famed R&amp;B duo K-Ci &amp; JoJo, and manages not to get swallowed up, as the song hits another gear and Sean marches through with barreling raps. They come perilously close to venturing full-on into vapid battle-of-the-sexes territory, but manage to survive on their chemistry. </p></div>"|21805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21805-twenty88/|6.5|Sheldon Pearce

They emerged early in the decade in an independent music world that was expanding its reach; information, then as now, was zipping around the world, but when FSA debuted, it was mostly traveling on paper. Indeed, the band, consisting at first of Dave Pearce and Rachel Brook (the latter also was a key member of the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2847-movietone/"">Movietone</a>), and later of Pearce alone, owed a great deal to the zine world that had blossomed in the '80s and was in this pre-internet moment in full flower.</p>
<p>One influential zine in particular, Ptolemaic Terrascope, founded and based in the rural west of England, championed FSA early, positioning them in a dark, drone-y, goth-derived scene that included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4605-windy-carl/"">Windy &amp; Carl</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2824-roy-montgomery/"">Roy Montgomery</a> along with Bristol acts like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4212-third-eye-foundation/"">Third Eye Foundation</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/84-amp/"">Amp</a>. During this period, you could be an impossibly murky and impenetrable lo-fi psychedelic band obscure enough that even devoted indie music fans had never heard of you, but still play a Peel Session, release singles and EPs on 7-inch vinyl (this when turntables were considered by most a hopelessly passé marker of the clunky analog era), and find yourself with a modest and devoted international cult. These two records, now reissued on vinyl by Drag City, find Flying Saucer Attack at the moment in the mid-'90s when their sound hit its stride.</p>
<p>Flying Saucer Attack were less about invention and more about combining disparate ingredients in a new way. Their most distinctive feature on first listen is the thick blanket of feedback and distortion that overwhelms almost everything else. The roots of this technique were clearly in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"">Jesus and Mary Chain</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11882-psychocandy-darklands-automatic-honeys-dead-stoned-dethroned/""><i>Psychocandy</i></a>, but where JAMC fetishized bubblegum pop, FSA applied hyper-distortion to British folk and the drifting throb of krautrock. So where the noise of JAMC and later shoegaze bands amplified the catchiness of their simple melodies, FSA blew up the abstraction, and where the best shoegaze noise generally hinted at an enveloping ocean of sensuality, FSA used similar techniques to wallow in feelings of extreme isolation and distance. This was music you used as insulation, raw material to thicken the space between you and the world, and these qualities were reinforced by the proudly D.I.Y. nature of the records; “home taping is reinventing music,” read a line on the spine of <i>Further</i>.</p>
<p><i>Further</i> from 1994 is arguably the quintessential Flying Saucer Attack album, with a little bit of everything—evocative instrumental miniatures, folky near-songs, extended spatial explorations—that made them good. There's plenty of fingerpicked acoustic guitar amid the white-noise din, and the bassy pulse of analog noisemakers floats in and out, evoking the spaciness of early '70s synth music. Pearce's voice, a husky tenor indeterminate pitch, is as buried as a voice can possibly be, but despite his extreme limitations as a vocalist, he manages to communicate melancholy, alienation, and loneliness. “Still Point” features lead vocals by Brook, her slightly warmer tone breaking the illusion that Pearce is the last person in the world. The ballad “Come and Close My Eyes” is structured enough that you could almost see someone covering it, while “To the Shore” is a gnarly instrumental that moves from a cymbal tap to churning sonic violence and back to delicate acoustic guitar over the course of 12 minutes.</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i> from 1995 is a collection of singles, B-sides, and a Peel Session, but Flying Saucer Attack's general approach was so narrow it feels like a proper album. The two main differences are a uniformity of song length, befitting the 7-inch format, and, at places, a growing technological sophistication, as if Pearce was learning how to squeeze more out of his 4-track. The precise layering of the rumbling distortion and simple melody on “Popol Vuh III” demonstrate considerable craft, and “Beach Red Lullaby,” another Brook lead and a gorgeous acoustic folk song, sounds like a genuine product of another time, an accompaniment to a grainy art film that Pink Floyd might have soundtracked several decades earlier. There's a track called “Feedback Song,” demonstrating just how much Pearce embraced his defining aesthetic, and later in the collection, as if that wasn't enough, we get “Feedback Song Demo.” But despite the repetition and the feeling of deja vu, <i>Chorus</i> hangs together and makes for a richly rewarding 40-minute listen; Flying Saucer Attack are living proof that you only need a couple of ideas as long as they're good ones.</p></div>"|21587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21587-further-chorus/|8.5|Mark Richardson

In between studying neuroscience, philosophy, Russian, and electroacoustics, Claire Boucher started<b> </b>making freaky GarageBand songs under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a>. She became a fixture at Lab Synthèse, a DIY loft space that encouraged collaboration among artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31231-sean-nicholas-savage/"">Sean Nicholas Savage</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29315-braids/"">Braids</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17980-blue-hawaii/"">Blue Hawaii</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz/"">Majical Cloudz</a>. Boucher's early experimentations were<b> </b>a far cry from the sugary K-pop punches she makes today, instead leaning towards slow-building, dense, and jumbled productions. Her first proper release, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15751-geidi-primes/""><i>Geidi Primes</i></a>, received unexpected praise beyond her local scene. Nine months later, she released <i>Halfaxa</i>, 15 ethereal tracks in which her vocals approached pure glossolalia.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Halfaxa</i> is Grimes at her most mystical. Boucher has referred to it as her ""medieval album"" in terms of intent and subject matter. She once <a href=""http://forthebeat.com/blog/2010/09/interview-with-grimes/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a> that the record is meant to be an electronic interpretation of Middle Age Christian reverence, an exploration of sensations beyond earthly experience: ""I wanted to capture the beauty of being in a beautiful cathedral and hearing reverbed (naturally), devotional, vocal music and really believing in heaven and hell."" Many of Boucher's theories for <i>Halfaxa</i> were inspired by her own ""idol"" at the time, Hildegard von Bingen, a 12th-century German saint without musical training whose music was inspired by divine visions she received starting at the age of three. As explained in von Bingen's theological text <i>Liber Vitae Meritorum</i>, after The Fall, music became a means of accessing a lost state of perfection. Boucher would later lament that her early musical ventures were recorded when she ""didn’t really know what [she] was doing,"" but listeners discovering <i>Halfaxa</i> in 2016 are aware of her technical ascent, producing and engineering 2015’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21264-art-angels/""><i>Art Angels</i></a> entirely on her own.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Accordingly, <i>Halfaxa</i> is not direct in the same manner as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16211-grimes-visions/""><i>Visions</i></a> or <i>Art Angels</i>, which are less enigmatic and perhaps more easily digestible. Lyrics are abstracted to the point of becoming unintelligible, but not in a way that is grating or guttural. Instead, Boucher channels her inner cherub; her singing evokes harps atop clouds. Vocally, <i>Halfaxa</i> finds Boucher inspired by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10697-mariah-carey/"">Mariah Carey</a>'s soaring top notes and purity of tone. On ""Intor / Flowers,"" Boucher’s voice stretches towards heavenly octaves before layering itself beneath soprano sighs. The most mysterious songs on <i>Halfaxa</i> rely solely on tone, elongation, and repetition so heavily that it is best to give up the search for linear movement completely. Her vocals reaches such high peaks throughout that by the end of the record the distinction between machine and musician blurs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Offering a deeper sense of Grimes' world, <i>Halfaxa</i>'s song titles reference Boucher's diverse intellectual interests. ""Weregild,"" a jittering incantation of a dance track, takes its name from an archaic legal value placed on all beings and pieces of property, based on social rank. The latter half of ""sagrad прекрасный"" means ""beautiful"" in Russian, and ""Dragvandil"" is a Viking sword in <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>.  With these titles, Boucher is teasing signifiers and then distorting meaning, ultimately keeping the personal to herself, underscoring her eccentricity. Referring to her ex-boyfriend, Majical Cloudz’s Devon Welsh, ""Devon"" is the closest thing to an explicit expression of devotion. Inside her syrupy murmurs, Boucher proclaims, ""But you don’t love me anymore/ And I’ve never felt so broken up before."" It’s a startlingly clear moment within an album that strives to limit direct interpretations.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Somewhere along the line, Boucher<a href=""http://grimes-claireboucher.tumblr.com/post/137177684315/if-you-are-a-grimes-fanfanpage-please-reblog"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> lost</a> the rights to her early records. Six years after its original release, <i>Halfaxa</i> is being reissued by Arbutus, her first label. Boucher has made it clear that she has nothing to do with the reissue. Copies of the record sell for over $200 online, so reissuing it on vinyl is a convenient way for Arbutus to make <i>Halfaxa</i> more accessible while also making money. It's an unfortunate shadow to have attached to her early work, but nonetheless, <i>Halfaxa</i> foreshadows the musician Boucher is today: enigmatic, intimate, and uncompromising. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><b>Correction:</b> An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that Boucher receives no payment for sales of this reissue. </p></div>"|21775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21775-halfaxa/|7.8|Quinn Moreland

Kooshanejad in particular stands out amongst peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"">Actress</a> because he's not framing his work as a deconstruction of dance music, nor does his knowledge of Persian classical music figure heavily in his work. The digital world, and the software that engenders it—the way it allow users to re-scale, re-orient, and and re-produce sound—is the only apparent framework for Kooshanejad's work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>I AKA I</i> is Kooshanejad's second album under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33075-ash-koosha/"">Ash Koosha</a> alias, following last year's <i>GUUD</i>. He's a multimedia artist, dabbling in film as well as expressing an interest in virtual reality. ""At some point in my life I thought it was good to specialize, but now I think it’s good to build a bigger product than just music,"" he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9722-ash-koosha-conducting-destruction/"">told Philip Sherburne</a> last year; he's diversified, in other words. But <i>I AKA I</i> is a complex sonic statement, one where sound qua sound is the order of the day. Kooshanejad works by breaking down samples into unrecognizable blips of sound, and then layering them up into thickets of melody and rhythm. There is the sense that any individual noise could be one locus on a larger waveform, any melodic line or rhythmic figure a patchwork of them.</p>
<p>This leads to a lot of exciting moments that occur outside of traditional structures. Rhythms slur and slow down; melodies coagulate and dissipate. It's exciting or directionless depending on your mood. For this reason I prefer <i>I AKA I</i> when vestiges of Kooshanejad's music studies show up, such as on the stately melody that underpins ""Eluded,"" trading space with a halting, insidiously catchy melody. Or on ""Make It Fast,"" a lumpen hip-hop beat that contains trace elements of non-Western melodic modes (""Shah"" offers a similar experience). ""Biutiful"" owns its title, a nod to late-90s Warp acts that prized both grace and oddity.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Tracks like these offer windows with which to view Kooshanejad's work; how necessary the windows are will depend on your preferences. He's capable of being abstract (""Growl"") and obtuse (""In Line"") but while the album can be difficult it isn't exactly alien or otherworldly. From the jarring opening moments of ""Ote"" we know exactly what world this hails from: the digital, where it has been zoomed and cropped and clipped and reversed and shuffled. If anything, <i>I AKA I</i> is a reminder of how normal these concepts are becoming.</span></p></div>"|21766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21766-i-aka-i/|7.5|Andrew Gaerig

Isolated in the wilderness, unshackled from the pretense of civility, a yelp of primal kinship is supposed to rumble deep within, an exulting return to base instinct. Unless Jack London novels and Reese Witherspoon movies have lied to us, anyway. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/356-andrew-bird/"">Andrew Bird</a> went native last year, he didn’t so much as whisper. Instead, he clambered down into Utah’s Coyote Gulch and recorded<i> Echolocations: Canyon,</i> an instrumental folk-classical song cycle that scarcely rose above a purr. In an atmosphere where every sound carried magnitudes, the Chicago singer-songwriter remained slight; it was some of his most experimental and ruminative work, in a dense catalogue that has folded in chamber-pop, rustic Americana, swing and Romani rock. (Not to mention, <i>Echolocations</i> boasted some pinnacle twee titlework: ""The Canyon Wants to Hear C Sharp"" is a hairsbreadth from a Zach Braff script note.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Since releasing his first album in 1996, Bird has been a consistently gentle hand that belies a fitful mind, his sharp-edged intellect making invariably lovely inlets. This is a classically trained multi-instrumentalist who devotes equal attention to his violin and guitar onstage, a voluble and arcane lyricist who whistles full solos with the blithe, pitch-perfect clarity of a damn angel’s piccolo. But while Bird could putter along on smug displays of his technical prowess, the sort he nodded to in his earliest records, he only grows more inclusive with age. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33320-sarcosuchus/"">Punch Brothers</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a>, he slots his conservatory chops into increasingly accessible pop melodies, aiming for kinship over virtuosity.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Are You Serious</i> is Bird’s first traditional album since 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17209-hands-of-glory/"">Hands of Glory</a></i>—save <i>Echolocations </i>and a <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/andrewbird/sets/things-are-really-great-here"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Handsome Family covers disc</a>, and the lolling <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18753-andrew-bird-i-want-to-see-pulaski-at-night/"">I Want To See Pulaski at Night</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18753-andrew-bird-i-want-to-see-pulaski-at-night/""></a></i> EP. It’s deceptively straightforward at first, unfolding genially as more guitar-driven rock than he’s attempted before, almost a sidestep of ambition with freewheeling frayed ends. But it’s still got all of Bird’s standby elements—the esoteric wordplay, the many stratas of strings—subtly edited into economy. ""Capsized,"" the opening track and lead single, is a bit of a red herring, vigorous and barnburning; it’s no ear-shredder by any means, but next to the tranquility of Bird’s most recent fare, it’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>. Guitars corrode Bird’s lamenting voice, which adds a nü-country hitch to his grousing; guest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32932-moses-sumney/"">Moses Sumney</a> sands the edges with sweet harmonizing. (The excellent guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32413-blake-mills/"">Blake Mills </a>also sits in with Bird’s band throughout.) ""Saints Preservus"" is one of scant instances of Bird’s whistling; it’s an eerie, light flourish here, capping pizzicato strings.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is also Bird’s third album of pop originals since getting married and having a son, and a happy domesticity informs it. But Bird’s hectic mind, which once likened love to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16356-break-it-yourself/"">""assured asphyxiation,""</a> still can’t leave well alone; in ""Valleys of the Young,"" a brawny power ballad, he opens with the cerebral skirmish, ""Do you need a reason we should commit treason/ And bring into this world a son?"" Crashing guitars offer the resolution, an openhearted expanse that nods to <i>Pulaski at Night</i>. In ""Bellevue,"" a lovely, swooning ballad and the album closer, he is thunderstruck—""Now I found someone who can slake my thirst/ In a land beset by drought""—but it’s forebodingly titled, sharing a name with one of the country’s most infamous psychiatric hospitals.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album’s most curious track is ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63782-andrew-bird-and-fiona-apple-join-for-left-handed-kisses/"">Left Handed Kisses</a>,"" a thorny duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/116-fiona-apple/"">Fiona Apple</a>. It posits Bird as the jaded bard and Apple the sentimental muse, albeit one sapped by his cynicism; she addresses it directly in lyrics that only grow more self-referential. ""The point your song here misses is that if you really loved me/ You'd risk more than a few 50-cent words in your backhanded love song,"" she warbles, delivering that mouthful with improbable serenity. By the time the coda kicks in, appendaged with his cry, ""Now it's time for a handsome little bookend,"" the meta musings have become a wearying knot. It’s an example of Bird’s puppyish energy—why write a mere love ditty when you can slam through its fourth wall like the Kool-Aid Man? – and one of two times on <i>Are You Serious</i> that Bird gets a bit self-congratulatory in his cleverness. The other is the title track, which jostles spaghetti western-leaning strings with Bird’s drawls of, ""You used to be so willfully obtuse/ Or is the word abstruse?/ Semantics like a noose/ Get out your dictionary."" The accuser manages to be a healthy amount of both in that quatrain, an irony that likely doesn’t escape him. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album’s best melody lies in the violin crests of ""Roma Fade,"" conduits of real wonder; Bird opens giddily, then interrupts himself with a tourettic burst of creepiness: ""You may not know me but you feel my stare,"" he intones, as even the guitars shudder to an apprehensive stop. Then he backtracks to the slightly more tender notion, ""If she sees you, it changes you/ Rearranges your molecules."" For a fastidious artist who once explained his fairly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnYJRVTJkwA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hippie-dip songwriting strategy</a> as ""Does the universe need to hear this again?"" it’s a telling line. Still curious, still appraising, Bird offers an intellect remarkably porous to change.</p></div>"|21751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21751-are-you-serious/|7.2|Stacey Anderson

Its intentions are messy: Sam Ray resurrected his old band by popular demand (<span>vis-à-vis</span> his other projects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32107-ricky-eat-acid/"">Ricky Eat Acid</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31228-julia-brown/"">Julia Brown</a>) and will be touring throughout the spring, yet they are also calling it their <a href=""http://runforcoverrecords.limitedrun.com/products/567172-teen-suicide-its-the-big-joyous-celebration-lets-stir-the-honeypot"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">last will and testament</a>. Its presentation signifies wild ambition, but Ray appears more interested in capturing fleeting bits of casual brilliance than making good on grandiose designs. The ugliest song is called ""Beauty,"" one of the prettiest is ""Neighborhood Drug Dealer."" It's constantly absorbing and equal parts astonishing and frustrating. It's a party you can hear from down the block and yet still requires a password at the door. </p>
<p>Ray's ascent as an indie/DIY auteur has been propelled by his prolificity and his equally active desire to circumvent any barrier between him and his listeners. This personality (or persona) is  as crucial to full appreciation of <i>Celebration</i> as the music. As he shows with his projects outside of Teen Suicide, Ray is direct, omnivorous and unpredictable: <i>Celebration</i> feints at stop-start post-punk, patches in some nifty acoustic progressions on loan from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32330-alex-g/"">Alex G</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21138-beach-music/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21138-beach-music/""><i>Beach Music</i></a>, flirts with psychedelia and throws out some jazz noodling as well. And this is just the first song.</p>
<p>At their core, Teen Suicide is the most ""indie rock"" of Ray's projects and in that form, they write poignant song-sketches that can traffic in sarcasm (""it's not art unless you laugh, one of these days I'm gonna laugh"") and have a poignant sweetness (""Falling Out of Love With Me""). But the lo-fi recording quality serving as <i>Celebration</i>'s binding agent has a far greater effect the further Teen Suicide get away from guitars. The resplendent piano rolls of ""I Don't Think It's Too Late"" and ""The Stomach of the Earth"" are slightly scuffed and distorted, like a tear-stained take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31225-the-range/"">the Range</a>'s recent emotronica. ""My Little World"" touches on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s <a href=""http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-aphex-twin-but-were-afraid-to-ask-before-todays-release-of-syro/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early ambient work</a>, while the crackle surrounding the harps and strings on  ""V.I.P."" carry the haunted-house eeriness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"">the Caretaker</a>'s Victrola memory experiments. It's hard to think of any album, probably ever, that managed to sound like these three and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3902-sparklehorse/"">Sparklehorse</a> in the same hour.  </p>
<p>His use of tape manipulation and sampled orchestral bric-a-brac dutifully marked in the treasure map-like credits (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32493-girlpool/"">Girlpool</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32876-elvis-depressedly/"">Elvis Depressedly</a>, Alex G, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31108-porches/"">Porches</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"">Owen Pallett</a> and more) put him in the lineage of Elephant 6, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2756-the-microphones/"">Microphones</a> or early Saddle Creek. But Teen Suicide's crucial novelty lies in how they connect modern forms of communication and dissemination—it's a celebration of how Bandcamp and Soundcloud can allow songs to be released in an instant while constantly mutating (this was not invented by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21542-the-life-of-pablo/""><i>The Life of Pablo</i></a>) and, of course, any form of social media.</p>
<p>Most of the lyrics appear to be trimmed to fit for maximum impact within a character limit and even if they're not necessarily about <i>him</i>, Ray takes advantage of the presumption that songwriting is an autobiographical mode. As a result, the listener is inclined to relate to the person going through the harrowing narratives here. They all read like casual conversations, but the kind you can only have when the speaker has a total lack of a filter and a complete trust in the person on the other end. Some of his best lines are brazen provocations (""depression is a construct""); many sound like jokes but are devastating insights about drug abuse and suicidal ideation. Most importantly, they're very, <i>very</i> quotable. Witness the best of the lot: ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement </a>were an OK band/but you don't gotta sound like them.""</p>
<p><span>This isn’t some kind of Kill Yr Idols mission statement</span><span>—</span><i>Celebration</i><span> has enough ’90s indie rock in its genes to suggest that Ray thinks Pavement were at least </span><i>OK. </i><span>But most of  Ray’s colleagues in </span><a href=""http://orchidtapes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Orchid Tapes</a><span> or </span><a href=""http://www.runforcoverrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Run For Cover</a><span>  or any of the leading figures in post-emo are developing intensely dedicated, often </span><i>young</i><span> fanbases without the previously established means of generating sustainable indie rock success or the previously established canonical influences.  The bands they sometimes remind me of—Bright Eyes circa </span><i>Fevers &amp; Mirrors</i><span>, for instance—won only begrudging respect from older listeners at the time it was released. The directness with which it speaks to its audience makes it easy to imagine </span><i>Celebration</i><span> inspiring a lot of its younger listeners to start a band. For anyone else, it’s just an inspiring testament to indie rock’s continued vitality.</span></p>

<p>Plenty of elite musicians can genre-hop like this. Fewer can bring academic-sounding concepts and groove together into an individual language that cheats neither tradition. So it makes sense that veteran saxophonist and composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33548-henry-threadgill/"">Henry Threadgill</a> is one of Moran’s heroes—and that Moran would one day wind up in one of this giant’s bands. Since the 1970s, Threadgill has honed an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0Lsioz0Wtg&amp;list=PLOBG8sMb9s3wLcPxrTZSCDnUdHgPE7YhJ&amp;index=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>urgent and bluesy</span></a> sound (usually on alto saxophone), while also leading ensembles that feature unusual combinations of instruments (like <a href=""https://henrythreadgill.bandcamp.com/track/off-the-prompt-box-exordium"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>tuba and cello</span></a>).</p>
<p>""My head nods to Threadgill just as deep as it does <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a>,"" Moran <a href=""https://pirecordings.com/album/pi43"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>has said</span></a>. And it’s true that Threadgill expects his bandmates to keep track of a beat, even when his compositions tilt away from traditional harmony—as has been the case over the past decade. On his new record, Threadgill steps back from playing entirely, in order to conduct an opus that springs from his bumptious and melodically pungent late style. <i>Old Locks and Irregular Verbs</i> is an extended work that Threadgill composed as a tribute to the late avant-jazz pioneer Butch Morris (who developed a method for leading group improvisations that is known as ""conduction""). Like the best Morris performances, <i>Old Locks</i> offers plenty of room for twisty, adventurous solos, while also feeling like a tight 47 minutes.</p>
<p><span>Threadgill’s lineup includes Moran as well as the Cuban progressive jazz talent David Virelles (on separate pianos), the two-alto attack of saxophonists Curtis MacDonald and Roman Filiu, driving percussion courtesy of Craig Weinrib—and a pair of veterans from the band Zooid, Threadgill’s other active performing vehicle. Given their deep experience with the composer’s recent work, Jose Davila’s tuba and Christopher Hoffman’s cello provide some of the album’s most rewarding soloing. (On CD and in <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DNA06SE?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=old%20locks%20and%20irregular%20verbs&amp;qid=1459781648&amp;ref_=sr_1_2&amp;sr=8-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>download</span></a> versions, the recording is indexed into four ""parts,"" but it’s meant to be absorbed as a whole.)</span></p>
<p><span>""Part 1"" starts off with delicate piano interplay, courtesy of Moran and Virelles. An early, descending run of chords establishes an air of a lament before collapsing into a stark tone-cluster, signaling that this tribute to the departed will not be a meek or morose affair. </span>The end of the brief ""Part 2"" sees Weinrib moving between spacier playing and blasts of fractured funk. Hoffman has a sublime cello feature at the start of ""Part 3""—full of quick exclamations and longer, graceful lines. ""Part 4"" kicks off with the pianists, once again. This time, however, they’re collaborating on a lushly harmonized, hymn-like theme. Even the improvised runs of dissonance have an ecstatic feel by this point, and when the full ensemble joins in, Threadgill’s memorial to Morris’ life and art feels emotionally complete.</p>
<p><span>The set marches on from grief over a lost comrade, and in doing so eventually creates a fervent celebration of the lived experience. Jazz’s roots are in New Orleans, and so the music has always had access to post-funeral stomp. But as with his manner of approaching any other genre tradition, Threadgill works new changes on the expected patterns. He’s a fan of vintage tools, but an experimentalist when it comes to grammar.

You can find it in the yawning spaces between beats on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"">D'Angelo</a>'s ""Untitled (How Does It Feel)""; in the skeletal longing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>'s ""When Doves Cry""; in the flickering throb of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"">Depeche Mode</a>'<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/""></a>s suitably named ""Enjoy the Silence""; in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a>'s ""Angeles,"" which countered music industry excess with stark strums and whispered venom. Bits and pieces of Smith's cautionary tale are woven into ""Angela,"" the penultimate track from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33303-dvsn/"">dvsn</a>'s debut album, <i>Sept. 5th</i>, and though the depressive singer/songwriter doesn't seem like an obvious reference point for this lusty R&amp;B project, the sonic nod makes a certain kind of sense. They both know emptiness. They both allow for holes in which listeners can fill in their dreams, desires, sorrows.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In his book <i>Every Song Ever</i>, music critic Ben Ratliff makes note of the intimacy that can arise from spareness. ""Open space, whether in a park or a poem or a song, is first an element of design,"" he writes. ""And then it is a sign, a signifier, or a symbol."" Part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>'s OVO Sound roster, dvsn—pronounced ""division""—take this idea of austerity-as-symbol to several extremes: in their gaping slow jams, yes, but also in their artwork, which is dominated by big division signs, and their public face, which has thus far been almost entirely faceless. No videos. No press photos. No needy guest shots from their famous boss. But even following in the fog of one-time enigma and fellow Torontonian the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">Weeknd</a>, dvsn's elusiveness doesn't seem like a gimmick. It feels assured. It understands that, in the face of digital endlessness, restraint is just as important as creation.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We do know a few things about dvsn. <i>Sept. 5th </i>was executive produced by two of Drake's most vital collaborators, Paul ""Nineteen85"" Jefferies and his mentor, Noah ""40"" Shebib, and also marks the the proper debut of Toronto vocalist Daniel Daley. All three men are around 30 years old, and the album speaks to their experience as artists—and their resoluteness as R&amp;B innovators who come from a city that still has <a href=""https://nowtoronto.com/music/features/why-cant-we-hear-local-hip-hop-r-b-on-toronto-radio/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">trouble</span></a> sustaining a contemporary urban radio station. Which is to say: The dvsn sound did not come together overnight. Jeffries and Daley have worked together for at least six years, and their <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/tstein35/sets/the-daniel-daley-collection"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">early collaborations</span></a> are flimsy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a> knock-offs, gaudy and green. ""Early on in my producing, I would just layer on every single sound I wanted to hear,"" Jeffries recently told <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2016/03/29/dvsn-nineteen85-paul-jefferies-ovo-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2""><i>Fader</i></span></a>. ""Getting all my dreams out on just one song."" Compared to those tracks, dvsn's songs sound like photo negatives, selfless and vast.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Daley's delivery has matured as well, trading in ""Idol""-style runs for sturdy melody lines that service nothing but the song. All of this can be heard on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17900-dvsn-hallucinations/"">Hallucinations</a>,"" in which Daley's featherlight falsetto is often screwed down with effects to literally halt any extraneous embellishments while also offering up more breathing room. On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17861-dvsn-too-deep/"">Too Deep</a>,"" which lovingly references <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29157-ginuwine/"">Ginuwine</a>'s 1999 hit ""So Anxious,"" an unnamed female choir gets most of the spotlight, with Daley chiming in for whispered accents here and there. </span><span class=""s1"">This grown-up musical strategy is also reflected in the way dvsn approach their songwriting <i>raison d'être</i>: sex.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Sept. 5th </i>uses contemporary sounds to explore the positive and meaningful aspects of carnality. This puts the album in a sort of limbo: It feels much more adult compared to the casual, hip-hop-indebted come ons of R&amp;B up-and-comers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33439-tory-lanez/"">Tory Lanez</a> and Bryson Tiller, but it's not as indebted to the genre's traditions as artists like Anthony Hamilton or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6752-jill-scott/"">Jill Scott</a>. If neo-soul found 1990s artists taking inspiration from '70s masters, dvsn's neon soul puts a <i>Blade Runner</i> sheen on '90s and 2000s classics by the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"">R. Kelly</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"">Aaliyah</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"">Ciara</a>. There's no rapping here; the word ""bitch"" is never uttered. Some of the album's best moments also feature female voices along with Daley's. This is not corny music, but it is respectful, even sweet at times. It treats sex not as a social transaction but a serious act—something that can make you see things that aren't there, that can be a balm for life's rough edges, that can make you realize the worth of looking beyond yourself. These songs are consensual in every sense of the word.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And in that sense, <i>Sept. 5th </i>can be read as a kind of romantic guide for people who are beginning to stare down their twenties in the rearview, who are considering investing a big chunk of themselves into another person. As dvsn tell it, there will be plenty of heat—the languid ""In + Out"" is exactly what you think it is—but also a few complications. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18148-dvsn-try-effortless/"">Try / Effortless</a>"" has Daley struggling to put his pride aside as he considers a commitment; ""Another One"" is a cheating song that only deals with the act's existential aftermath; grand finale ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17764-dvsn-the-line/"">The Line</a>"" is a seven-minute proposal that lingers in the comfort and ecstasy that love can bring. ""At the end of it all I'm coming back to you,"" Daley concludes, as a woman's voice echoes in the cavernous expanse around him.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">The project's purposeful anonymity has a few drawbacks. Though Prince is a clear influence, dvsn barely hint at the idiosyncratic kinkiness or sense of play that drives so much of that icon's music. And aside from the album's title, there's a slightly frustrating lack of specificity to be found in these songs; perhaps this is meant as a generous sign of universality, but it can also come across as unimaginative. Then again, considering the unseemly baggage R&amp;B fans are presented with while listening to R. Kelly or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10805-chris-brown/"">Chris Brown</a>, dvsn's namelessness can offer its own relief. ""In art, the confident gesture, loud or quiet, is of highest importance,"" Ratliff writes in his book. ""By extension, the acknowledgement of the human behind it… is secondary, if relevant at all."" This group is wise and capable enough to eschew nearly every shortcut of today's personality-first music culture and dial into the silence between the noise. It's what confidence sounds like.</span></p></div>"|21756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21756-sept-5th/|8.3|Ryan Dombal

<p dir=""ltr"">That narrative further congealed when<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13922-odd-blood/""> Odd Blood</a></i> positioned Yeasayer as a glossier version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"">MGMT</a> (or stonier version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27152-empire-of-the-sun/"">Empire of the Sun</a>), but the transformation largely pleased fans: “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11859-one/"">O.N.E.</a>” and “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11604-ambling-alp/"">Ambling Alp</a>” remain two of the band’s most successful and beloved songs. So, when<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16940-fragrant-world/""> Fragrant World</a></i> dropped in 2012, it was almost a surprise that Yeasayer took another creative left turn, abandoning synth-hippie bacchanalia for a more en-vogue, minimalistic sound. (Their lyrics, however, remained a similar mixture of oblique references, social commentary, and love songs.) Four years later, the band now has a chance to take stock of its motley career and reset expectations once again. And to their credit,<i> Amen &amp; Goodbye</i> may be the first time the band has doubled down on its weirdest impulses. The result is an ambitious psychedelic quasi-concept record that is refreshingly (sometimes bizarrely) out of step with current trends, occasionally baffling, but mostly unsuccessful.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nowhere is Yeasayer’s latest iteration better crystallized than “I Am Chemistry,” a psych-pop opus that, given the title and sartorial stylings of the band, you might assume is about drugs, but is actually—possibly literally—about toxic chemicals. (Keating sings, “A C4H10FO2P puts you on your knees,” listing out the molecular structure of Sarin gas.) This could be another instance of Yeasayer attempting to get political (see: ""Reagan's Skeleton”) or an extended analogy about a troubled relationship. But ""chemicals weapons = bad"" is hardly a nuanced worldview and neither is identifying emotional instability with DDT. Worse, is the song's clunky sexual imagery. The words, “She only needs my help pleasuring herself beneath the rue leaves,” are sung with a vague <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">John Lennon</a> impersonation that the band returns to throughout the album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sonically, things aren’t any more coherent. The chorus to ""I Am Chemistry""—big and syrupy—plays like an outdated bid for alt-rock radio play, but it clashes with the other discordant elements in the arrangement. Surprisingly pleasant, however, is the bridge, sung by The Roches member Suzzy Roche, which sounds like something <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> would have stitched into the fabric of a mid-’70s arena anthem, but it doesn’t jive with the otherwise slick production.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Other tracks are rarely more lucid, but just as ardent. “Gerson’s Whistle” is a keyboard-driven rocker that mixes elements of Yeasayer’s early-career folk harmonies (“Can you hear / There is something in the darkness”) with a vocal melody that heads into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6709-californication/""><i>Californication</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers/"">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> territory. It makes you wonder what type of listeners the band is trying to court—possibly all of them? ""Uma,"" a ballad that reaches for emotional resonance, comes off only as a treacly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> knockoff. However, ""Cold Night,"" the most straightforward song on the album, is a simple pleasure. Rather than pile on historical or philosophical allusions, the lyrics are straightforward and immediate. ""I regret all the times I didn't respond to you,"" goes one mournful statement, a sentiment we can all identify with.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">According to the band, <i>Amen &amp; Goodbye</i> was recorded in the Catskills, where the band attempted to return to a less digitally-saturated existence and there’s certainly an argument to be made that <i>Amen &amp; Goodbye</i> is about the strife between contemporary technology and spirituality. But with songs that play like a grab-bag of genres and lyrics that have little of the humor or self-awareness the band displayed in the past, it's hard to muster the patience to uncover anything deeper. <i>Amen &amp; Goodbye</i> plays as a sincere attempt at recreate the type of album that the band loved from decades past—meandering, experimental, uncompromising. This may seem interesting to the members of Yeasayer, but listeners will be left wondering where the band's interest in pop economy went. But the audacity, it should be noted, is huge.</p>

""Please don't tell me, you don't have to, darling/ I can sense that he painted you a gushing sunset and slayed a few panthers in your defence,"" Turner sang on ""Separate and Ever Deadly."" By the final song, ""Time Has Come Again,"" he found himself heartbroken and weeping in the street. This bold record was a cover for a severe case of imposter syndrome, which Kane evoked in a lovely turn of phrase on ""Separate..."": ""Can't you see I'm the ghost in the wrong coat, biting butter and crumbs?""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Eight years on, the starting blocks are very different. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys/"">Arctic Monkeys</a> are five albums in, and Alex Turner could feasibly lay claim to being one of the biggest rock stars in the world. Miles Kane could feasibly lay claim to being friends with one of the biggest rock stars in the world. Both artists now live in L.A., and their long-awaited second album, <i>Everything You've Come to Expect</i>, is a lavish California confection, featuring a 29-piece orchestra recorded at Hollywood's storied United Recording, and arranged by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"">Owen Pallett</a>. His work here puts him on a par with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4991-jean-claude-vannier/"">Jean-Claude Vannier</a>, the man behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"">Gainsbourg</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12852-histoire-de-melody-nelson/"">.<i>..Melody Nelson</i></a>: The first five songs at least are totally gorgeous, the strings glassy, the tone all understated seduction, the structures fluid and surprising. Dusty opener ""Aviation"" could be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/650-calexico/"">Calexico</a> playing backing band to some tortured crooner; ""Miracle Aligner"" is a fever dream of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"">the Replacements</a>' ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbhQKffugNk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swingin Party</a>,"" while the title track turns French carousel organs into a captivating narcotic spiral. It's the perfect music for the Daniel Craig-era James Bond films: sophisticated, tortured—and with a weakness for temptation.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33499-zayn/"">Zayn Malik</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21764-mind-of-mine/""><i>Mind of Mine</i></a>, <i>Everything You've Come to Expect</i> makes very clear that Turner and Kane are sexy men with sexy lives having lots of sexy sex with their sexy girlfriends. The only difference between them is a seven-year age gap. Sometimes they still sound as awestruck as on their debut. On ""She Does the Woods,"" ostensibly a song about shagging in the bushes, Turner is dazzled by the girl looming above him, behind her, ""a spirograph of branches that dance on the breeze."" There are numerous songs about fucking—""Just let me know when you want your socks knocking off,"" ""Baby, we ought to fuck seven years of bad luck out the powder room mirror""—and, with grim inevitability, songs about how girls have fucked them over. ""Bad Habits"" truly establishes Kane as the Austin Powers to his mate's Bond, as he yelps over blood-red bolero that he ""should've known, little girl, that you'd do me wrong.""  </p>
<p class=""p1"">By the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7676-josh-homme/"">Homme</a>-tinged desert rider ""Used to Be My Girl,"" misanthropy has set in. ""Gimme all your love so I can fill you up with hate,"" they ooze. One of the inspirations for <i>Everything You've Come to Expect</i> was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2054-isaac-hayes/"">Isaac Hayes</a>' glorious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13233-hot-buttered-soul/""><i>Hot Buttered Soul</i></a>, but that's not the first thing that comes to mind here. There's a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXnoWb88Jr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">scene</a> in 1967's <i>Bedazzled</i> where Dudley Moore, as part of his deal with the devil, wishes to become a pop star so that girls will love him. Wish granted, he immediately finds himself eclipsed by his rival, played by Peter Cook, who has formed a band called Drimble Wedge and the Vegetations. Their deathless hit track, in hock to 1960s English psychedelia, goes, ""I'm fickle, I'm cold, I'm shallow/ You fill me with inertia/ Don't get excited.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">For a few years now, Turner has sported a well-greased quiff and an obscure attitude (""<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/feb/20/alex-turners-brits-speech-what-it-all-meant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">invoice me for the microphone</a>""). You suspect he adopted the rock star posture as a protective mechanism to deal with his massive profile, while for Kane, every middle-aged dad's favorite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4573-paul-weller/"">Paul Weller</a> substitute, it's a retrograde aspiration. They expose the dark side of their Faustian pact for fame and fortune towards the end of the record, where inspiration dims. ""Pattern"" sounds like the kind of orch-pop move that was often favored by Britpoppers to show that they were <i>real artistes</i> with longevity beyond the movement, and has similar subject matter—though Turner, no less a gifted lyricist than ever, manages to imbue the comedown with a little poetry, admitting, ""I slip and I slide like a spider on an icicle.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">He's at his most lugubrious and lizardy on ""The Dream Synopsis,"" a silky string-laden number where he reminisces about flirting with a girl who worked in a kitchen, when the most danger going was getting caught kissing by the pans. Curiously, ""The Bourne Identity"" comes back to imposter syndrome, in a violin-heavy hero's lament peppered with plenty of great lyrics. Turner's got a ""glass-bottomed ego,"" he's ""the sequel you wanna see but you were kinda hoping they would never make,"" ""haunted by the sweet smell of self-esteem."" It's hard to think of more perfect descriptions of feeling insufficient. But Turner and Kane are so convincingly cocksure elsewhere, it's hard to feel too sorry for them. As the Last Shadow Puppets make abundantly clear on their second album, they made their own bed.</p></div>"|21596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21596-everything-youve-come-to-expect/|5.6|Laura Snapes

But nothing compares to what she does as the spine of L.A.’s Autolux. Her evolution is palpable across the din of the trio’s first two albums, 2004’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/459-future-perfect/""><i>Future Perfect </i></a>and 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14540-transit-transit/""><i>Transit Transit </i></a>as she, bassist Eugene Goreshter and guitarist/keyboardist Greg Edwards split the difference between the electronic and the organic. On <i>Pussy’s Dead,</i> they take this distinct hybrid of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7345-dirty-deluxe-edition/"">Dirty</a>-</i>era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> dissonance and vintage 4AD dreaminess completely into the EDM/IDM machine.</p>
<p>They worked in collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/20890-boots/"">Boots</a>, collaborator with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31319-run-the-jewels/"">Run the Jewels</a>, and his influence is all over these 10 songs. Azar has already mastered the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8cSe7RvqSM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bonzo stomp</a>, but the discipline of abstract timekeeping she constructs on songs like the sultry “Soft Scene” and the trap-like “Junk For Code” are new. They have the metronomic mastery and razor-edged precision of ?uestlove or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23694-philip-selway/"">Phil Selway</a>.</p>
<p>They've also stepped up their songwriting from their prior studio works. From Sonic Youth, they appear to have learned the ability to find melody in madness. The spacey piano ballad “Anonymous” or the gorgeous penultimate track “Change My Head” hits the transcendence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">Breeders</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a> records, bolstered by the vocal harmonies of Azar, Edwards and Goreshter. By the time you get to the buggy coda “Becker,” Edwards is singing in a high, plaintive tenor that feels open-hearted. Yet, as the second half of “Listen to the Order” indicates, they can wield slashing fuzz guitars to slice through you like hot shrapnel all the same.</p>
<p>For those of us who have been in Autolux’s corner since they first emerged from Los Angeles, it’s been a bit trying to watch this group hide in plain sight. All kudos go to Boots for parlaying this influence he’s garnered producing the likes of Beyoncé, Run The Jewels and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a> to help craft this record for a band whose breakthrough moment has eluded them for long enough. </p>

After spending much of the 2000s lost in a fog of self-examination that didn’t always make for compelling music, Mould roared back in 2012 with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16981-silver-age/""><i>Silver Age</i></a>, a record on which he once again embraced the loud guitars of his storied <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"">Hüsker Dü</a> youth. He also appeared to stop fighting against one of his greatest talents: the ability to write perfect pop-punk songs that feel and sound like getting punched in the face (in the best possible way). 2014’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19404-bob-mould-beauty-ruin/""><i>Beauty &amp; Ruin</i></a> mined similar sonic territory, furthering the rip and roar of <i>Silver Age</i> without necessarily bettering it.</p>
<p>On <i>Patch the Sky</i> Mould seems to be at peace, if not with the world at large, at least in regards to the way he can best address it. He may always be one of rock and roll’s great contrarians—angry, angsty, and loud—but after nearly 35 years of making records, he no longer seems determined to be kicking against his own strengths. In fact, he's finally embracing them. “I’m a really good rhythm guitar player, a fair vocalist, and a pretty simple songwriter,” Mould recently told the <i>New York Times</i>. “Now that I’ve come to accept that, it’s much easier to work with.” To that end, <i>Patch the Sky</i> has a remarkable sense of clarity—playing like a record that is less concerned with reinventing the wheel as opposed to simply refining it.</p>
<p>“<i>Can I find some truth within the noise?</i>” Mould asks on opening track “Voices in My Head.” It’s a question that the rest of <i>Patch the Sky</i> answers with a resounding yes. The best tracks on the record are the most furiously full-throttled, many of which threaten to drown out Mould’s voice entirely. “The End of Things” lets fly with one of the best riffs Mould has written in a decade, bashed out with the kind of stupid raw enthusiasm that brings to mind the best of his Sugar output back in the ’90s. Similarly, tracks like “Daddy’s Favorite,”  “Pray For Rain,” and “Hands Are tied” (a punked out rave up that revs up and explodes in under two minutes) all provide the gleeful no-nonsense squall of the world’s most amped garage band.</p>
<p>Joined by drummer Jon Wurster and bassist Jason Narducy, Mould seems to be having a genuinely good time here, even when the subject matter veers directly (and somewhat predictably, for Mould) into apocalyptic territory (“Lucifer and God”) or tries to unpack frazzled relationships (“You Say You”). Mould still sounds best when he’s articulating anger at a high volume, and <i>Patch the Sky</i> succeeds largely because these songs sound as if they were hardwired to raw nerves. It’s only when the songs slow down slightly (“Hold On,"" “Black Confetti”) that they start to feel like a generic slog. </p>
<p>While he might never be able to duplicate the desperate urgency of his iconic punk rock past, Mould more than makes up with it in terms of sheer intensity. At 55, Mould has managed to do a bit of everything, his career having come full circle several times over. His voice—an odd, atonal yelp—still sounds the most absolutely right when paired with overdriven guitars. “I keep searching, hoping, waiting for the sun that always shines so bright on everyone,” he sings on album closer “Monument” providing a little light amid the dissonance. The songs here aren't necessarily breaking new ground stylistically, but that really isn't what matters. At this point, Mould clearly has nothing left to prove. </p></div>"|21776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21776-patch-the-sky/|7.0|T. Cole Rachel

This consistency, and his awareness of it, is</span> right there in his unshowy and uniform album covers, the design of which has remained entirely unchanged since the beginning of his career, save for a switch from beige to black two albums back. That steadfastness is entirely suited to the work itself: Repetition, extreme repetition, is its modus operandi, its bread and butter, its raison d'être. All of his songs follow same method: to isolate a single, suggestive loop within a piece of recorded music and to spin that thread out into a gauzy cocoon, warm and protective. Virtually all of his songs are built atop techno's steady pulse, but they share ambient music's domestic utility: If Satie's ""furniture music"" was meant to decorate rooms, the Field's music <i>is </i>the room.</div>
<p>At the base of his songs, he typically favors loops that are richly, sensuously textured—a typical snippet might consist of a millisecond-long mishmash of guitar, voice, and the merest sliver of hi-hat, to give it bite—but the source isn't important; on previous albums, he's used <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a>'s ""Under Ice,"" the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a>' ""Lorelei,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s ""Everywhere,"" the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5885-the-flamingos/"">Flamingos</a>' 1959 recording of ""I Only Have Eyes for You,"" and, perhaps most famously, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22706-lionel-richie/"">Lionel Richie</a>'s ""Hello,"" which reveals itself only at the end of 2007's ""A Paw in My Face"" after five minutes of anonymous shimmer, a startling kind of reverse sleight-of-hand. He's also created his own band and carried out the same techniques on them, for 2011's<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15790-looping-state-of-mind/"">Looping State of Mind</a></i>—the closest thing to a departure from the norm in his entire catalog. But on 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18538-the-field-cupids-head/""><i>Cupid's Head</i></a>, he abandoned his flirtation with song structures and delved back into sample-heavy web-weaving, resulting in what was then his most darkly enveloping album to date. <i>The Follower </i>follows its lead: It is, if anything, even denser, more dimly lit, more seamlessly contoured.</p>
<p>""The Follower"" worms its way nervously between major and minor keys, torn between a burly bass loop and gossamer choral pads. ""Pink Sun"" teases stuttering whispers and pealing guitar tones over a synthetic background that shimmers like Kevlar; the reverberant voices that give shape to ""Soft Streams"" suggest the echoing interior of a vast cathedral. But while his details are as wispy as ever, Willner also occasionally flexes more muscle here than we're accustomed to hearing from him. The bulbous low end and hard snare thwacks of ""The Follower"" recall Kompakt's classic brand of techno at its most potent and no-nonsense; the yearning ""Monte Verità,"" the album's emotional peak, distracts you with gauzy, wordless vocals and then knocks you senseless with bruising, overdriven drums.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that Willner's devotion to his chosen method has proven so productive is that repetition is such a powerful device. Loops can do funny things to your perception; especially when layered, they can conjure sounds that may or may not actually be present in the music—the ghostly byproducts of colliding frequencies. And with an average track length of nearly 10-and-a-half minutes, such extreme duration plays tricks upon the attention span. Take ""Reflecting Lights,"" the hypnotic, 14-minute closer: Sculpting a ringing loop of guitar, tabla, and delay into a hypnotic moiré pattern, it's so unchanging and ruthlessly reduced that it can be difficult to orient yourself within it. It's the techno equivalent of whiteout conditions. (Perhaps that's why my computer's Shazam app had a temporary meltdown during the song, spitting out a half-dozen erroneous matches—shiny digital reggae, Italian singer-songwriter pop, minimal techno—that didn't sound anything like it. Given recent advances in artificial intelligence, it seems heartening, somehow, that Willner's heavily abstracted electronic music is apparently so human that the algorithms can't quite wrap their heads around it.)</p>
<p>The loop is also the perfect vehicle to experiment with tension and release, and that's where Willner really excels. His arrangements favor long, monotonous stretches precisely in order to set up the emotional payoff that comes when a chord pivots and hangs, briefly, vibrating intensely, before coming to rest where it began. The feeling is akin to two small magnets held in reverse, so that they strain each other with a seemingly impossible force, before being flipped and snapping back together again. These tensions contribute to the overwhelming physicality of his music, so viscous that it feels like running underwater fully clothed. Perhaps it's because of their sampled provenance, but his sounds have an unusual sense of material weight, of drag—you can feel the stylus carving its way through the groove, shaving off a few microns' worth of wax, with every pass of the loop.</p>
<p>Even on an album premised on plateaus, there are peaks and troughs; the queasy buzz of ""Pink Sun"" is not as immediately satisfying as the pitched desire of ""Monte Verità"" or the rosy glow of ""Raise the Dead."" And it's worth asking whether ""Soft Streams"" really needs to be 11 minutes long, instead of, say, nine, or even seven. Still, for these pieces to work their magic, they need to pull you in, to blot out the world outside. And just as those moments of tension need something to pull against, highlights like ""Monte Verità"" require a muted background against which to shine. The Field's very first album set a high bar with its title, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10022-from-here-we-go-sublime/""><i>From Here We Go Sublime</i></a>, and the truth is that he got there a long time ago. But even if, at this point, he's just rearranging the furniture in God's own living room, it's still an environment unlike any other.</p>

Since the British producer started putting out records, in 2012, his music has blended the tough, percussive energy of contemporary UK house music, with its muscled low end, with the rich harmonies of sample-centric producers in a continuum that stretches through Pal Joey, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32085-moodyman/"">Moodymann</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27985-pepe-bradock/"">Pépé Bradock</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>. Stylistically, he hasn't changed much since his first singles. But while there's no shortage of electronic musicians who approach dance music as a form of collage, Vynehall has developed into a master craftsman. He's got a keen sense for tone color, and the way he mixes textures—blocky piano chords, silken disco strings, rounded horns—lends to an unusually tactile sensibility, like brushstrokes built up into thick waves and oily crusts.</p>
<p><i>Rojus</i> continues in the vein of 2014's mini-LP <i>Music for the Uninvited</i>, but it boasts a bigger sound in almost every way, with more layers, bolder basslines, and harder-edged drums. With the exception of beatless opener ""Beyond This,"" whose arpeggiated synth and sampled birdsong make for a breezy ambient aperitif, the record aims its sights squarely at the dancefloor, with bass and percussion pushed up in the mix and tempos locked between 118 and 124 BPM. Like <i>Music for the Uninvited</i>, which was inspired by the cassettes he listened to in his mother's car, <i>Rojus </i>is a loose sort of concept album, one that purports to compare the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7QZnwKqopo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mating rituals of birds of paradise</a> with the behavior of clubbers. (The title means ""paradise"" in Lithuanian; it comes from a book cover he serendipitously stumbled across around the same time as his epiphany regarding dancers and jungle fowl.)</p>
<p>The theme doesn't extend much further than the sampled caws and trills woven into a few tracks. Still, like his avian inspirations, who sometimes use tools to prep the patch of ground where they'll dance for potential mates, Vynehall proves a remarkably resourceful producer: Instead of limiting himself to a single drum machine, he avails himself of scads of percussion sounds sampled from a variety of sources—a choice that yields a vastly expanded palette of timbres and timing. ""Paradisea,"" one of the record's standouts, boasts at least three different sampled snares and a panoply of differently treated hi-hats; its syncopated accents are typical of the record's highly elastic sense of swing. The effect is a dizzying array of textures and frequencies, about as easy to parse as a rainstorm. </p>
<p>Vynehall only stumbles when it comes to the uniformity of his songs. They all avail themselves of similar types of sounds, and they all develop in exactly the same way—by beginning with a particularly resonant set of loops and then progressively adding more layers. To create tension, he'll mute a handful of sounds throughout the breakdown and then bring them back for a reprise. But there are no choruses, no bridges, no unexpected left turns. And his sounds sit so well in the mix, there are really no surprises, either. A little dissonance would go a long way.</p>
<p>Despite sonic attributes meant to suggest roughness, rawness, and even risk—the distortion, the swing, the grit—the music remains fundamentally agreeable, polite, even a little safe. Even the wordless cry that goes soaring over the top of ""Blush,"" meant to evoke a moment of total abandon, fits so well with all the other moving pieces that it provokes admiration for its craft more than it stirs, much less disturbs, the soul. It points you in the right direction, but it doesn't quite tip you over the edge.</p>
<p>In addition to its ornithological conceit, <i>Rojus </i>is supposed to represent the arc of a night out. But it doesn't quite manage: The music's intensity remains more or less constant from the second track on. A good nightclub should have nooks and crannies, hidden rooms, mysterious passageways; its layout should encourage all kinds of mystery and mischief. But as wonderfully appointed as <i>Rojus </i>is, it really offers just one vista: Once you're through its welcoming foyer, you know exactly where you're going to be and what you're going to hear until the doors close. As a set of tracks for DJs to pick from, <i>Rojus </i>offers plenty of potential. As a front-to-back listening experience, it's <i>almost</i> paradise—but not quite the album that it wants to be.</p></div>"|21627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21627-rojus/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"">Pet Shop Boys</a> have persisted long enough that their return to club music feels calmly liberated, without any grasping for pop hits—why bother, when EDM already reclaimed that territory? They stood very still while ears craned towards them. 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17032-elysium/"">Elysium</a> </i>had the detachment of a wet stamp, but <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18268-pet-shop-boys-electric/"">Electric</a>, </i>recorded with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14050-stuart-price/"">Stuart Price</a>, pushed the beats ardently uptempo, the bass leaping between octaves. <i>Electric</i>’s ready-for-the-weekend anthem saw Tennant asking his lover to stay until the end of it, the flirtatious chimes marking time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The second entry in a planned trilogy produced by Price, <i>Super</i> elaborates and intensifies <i>Electric</i>’s approach: Louder, brighter, more. It doesn’t have the sustained arc of that album, but Price specializes in renovating house and disco, modernizing with care, and his small details still beguile. Amidst the mounting noise of ""Inner Sanctum,"" a single piano note falls as if to the bottom of the ocean. The synths bounce like color through glass. Familiar Pet Shop Boys ideas or tricks appear faintly beneath it all, like they've attacked a palimpsest with crayons: ""Happiness"" begins as attenuated techno, and then, like ""You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You’re Drunk,"" Tennant lays down what might be a country singer’s guide vocal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These oversaturated shades spruce up a few clichés. ""Burn"" has a premise older than disco itself (this club will be kindling for our desire), but it plays out as romantic pomp, Tennant’s voice turning hushed and androgynous: ""It feels so good, it feels so good, it feels so good."" The Boys trusted Price enough to leave several tracks nearly instrumental, but you can sense their editorial hand slackening a little—<i>Super</i> is actually shorter than <i>Electric</i>, yet it runs three songs longer. ""Sad Robot World"" is an inadvertent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> parody; despite the usual nuance (""That’s how you are, or have to be""), ""Twenty-something"" references smartphones, startups, and ""trending ideas"" as if practicing a venture-capital pitch.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Super</i>’s best songs are no more subtle, but their noise produces strange contrasts. ""The Dictator Decides"" imagines an idle demagogue yearning to get strung up by his heels, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a> ghosting for Bashar Assad. ""Will someone please say the unsayable?"" Tennant pleads. ""Will someone please tell me I’m wrong? I live every day like a sad beast of prey, for I have to appear to be strong."" As he frets over secret prison facilities, the drumbeat marches to swiveling jackboots and distant gunfire. ""I’d rather that you didn’t shoot me / But I’d quite understand if you did,"" he sings, subsuming violence under fine manners in a distinctly English manner. Syria’s ruined borders, after all, were imposed in the first place by a diplomatic baronet.</p>
<p>A Pet Shop Boys narrator is so often the bereft observer: Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen/"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>'s characters, they tremble as they ache. ""The Pop Kids"" distends that feeling back across time, describing two friends who shared dances, favorites, and a passion neither could fully acknowledge. Tennant breathes ""Ohhh, I like it here,"" the sound of someone glancing around and knowing, with wanton contentment, that they would rather be nowhere else. As ’90s house piano swells each chorus, the characters might be thrilling to some <i>Behaviour</i> remix—the Pet Shop Boys are distantly recalling their own past too, memories in a stranger’s dream.</p></div>"|21576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21576-super/|6.9|Chris Randle

Hill's changed the lineup around him a handful of times since founding the band in 2007, and the sound's shifted just as often. They've had a couple different drummers, a few different guitarists and bassists. They've also moved from an act that brought to mind Helmet collaborating with Immortal to something that can bring to mind Sisters of Mercy stuck in a blackened downpour.</p>
<p>Hill has done all this while maintaining an eerie consistency—the group hasn't released a bad record, and their last two collections, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19421-tombs-savage-gold/""><i>Path of Totality</i></a> and 2014's <i>Savage Gold</i>, were among the best the years they came out. The music has always been precise and muscular, tough but elegant, even as they started working more elements into their sound: They are capable of making you think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4441-unsane/"">Unsane</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"">Darkthrone</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/307-bauhaus/"">Bauhaus</a> in the same song. The band name itself,""Tombs,"" is flexible—broad, everyday, non-specific—but it's always related to death.</p>
<p>Their new EP, <i>All Empires Fall</i>, features their biggest stylistic shift to date. Much of this is due to the addition of synth/electronics player and co-vocalist Fade Kainer, an avowed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"">Andy Stott </a>fan who used to front the crusty doom group, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31073-batillus/"">Batillus</a>, and currently plays in the power-electronics project, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30885-theologian/"">Theologian</a>, among other industrial-leaning acts. (The EP also welcomes new drummer Charlie Schmid of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30191-vaura/"">Vaura</a> and guitarist Evan Void of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31241-sadgiqacea/"">Sadgiqacea</a>.)</p>
<p>There's more space here than on past offerings. The songs are still coiled and intense, but Tombs allow themselves room to drift into dark chasms of rough, bleak ambience. You have to think this is partially a result of the flexibility Kainer affords them. He also adds Wax Trax howls alongside Hill's brutal barks. Hill continues to grow as a singer; When not shouting or screaming, he's crooning clean tones that can bring to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2868-peter-murphy/"">Peter Murphy</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6100-ian-curtis/"">Ian Curtis</a>. In the past I've likened Hill to a drill sergeant because of his muscles and shaved head. In person, though, he strikes me as especially calm, even zen. You do get the idea, however, that he's pushing the people around him to make the most disciplined music of their careers—and that they're happily following his lead.</p>
<p><i>All Empires Fall</i> is brief. There are five songs across 24 minutes, and it feels more like a palate cleanser than a complete offering. But because of its precision, and Sanford Parker's dense production, it's also powerful. Short instrumental ""The World is Made of Fire"" sounds like a post-metal anthem reminiscent of fellow Brooklynites <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30997-sannhet/"">Sannhet</a> until the entrance of melancholic, gothic-metal synths. It's followed by ""Obsidian,” which as its name suggests, offers swarming black metal. On the song, Hill growls""We are the fallen/ Manifest in shadows""; much of the record explores the apocalypse on a personal, individual level.</p>
<p>Like all of what Tombs does, the lyrics and music feel thoughtful— there are no tossed-off details in the maelstrom. The more mid-tempo ""Last Days of Sunlight” drips with haunted, clanging atmospherics; Hill chants lyrics that feel personal (""It is hard to forgive me/ 100 tears have fallen"") with a dead-eyed intonation. The shredding, bass-heavy, death rock-paced""Deceiver"" features dual vocals from Hill and Kainer, along with contributions from Sera Timms of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32014-black-mare/"">Black Mare</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30348-ides-of-gemini/"">Ides of Gemini</a>. It's kind of like industrial <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5895-watain/"">Watain</a>.</p>
<p>But it's the last song,""V”, that has me most excited for what they do next. Opening with a minute and a half of what sounds like a distant wind tunnel lined with ice, the six and a half minute track becomes an anthem that moves between black metal, post-punk, and death rock. Hill and Kainer repeatedly shout""Fall into the great divide/ Fall into the netherworld,"" while elegant synths and layers of guitars and drums fight it out behind them. It's maybe the catchiest song Tombs have ever written. It reminded me of the dark punk anthems that would sometimes show up on MTV's 120 Minutes when I was a kid, which made me think about how black metal is often just one step away from goth and punk.

Early EPs such as 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15085-cyanide-sisters-ep/""><i>Cyanide Sisters</i></a> and 2011's <i>Fairlight</i> introduced a project devoted to spacey slow-funk synth excursions with a whiff of ’80s nostalgia— an approach Haley continued on Com Truise's 2011 fine debut LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15604-galactic-melt/""><i>Galactic Melt</i></a>, and 2013's rarities grab bag <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16917-in-decay/""><i>In Decay</i></a>. Over the years, though, this ""Com Truise sound"" has seemed equally suited to remixes for pop stars like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK3uvRow_2I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a> or <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/maroon5-remixes/one-more-night-com-truise"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maroon 5</a> as well as for <a href=""http://ghostly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghostly International</a> labelmate <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1oG33tdODU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tycho</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31498-partynextdoor/"">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a> even sampled <i>Galactic Melt</i>'s ""Hyperlips"" for the highlight of the Drake protégé's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18284-partynextdoor-partynextdoor/"">self-titled 2013 debut</a>.</p>
<p>Working with other artists gives Haley a vocal presence that can go in front of his cleanly designed backdrops. Plenty of instrumental or nearly instrumental music can dominate the foreground, of course, but listening to Com Truise often feels like listening to a movie or videogame score. Which makes sense: Haley has described these releases as ""like a film score... from the mind"" for a storyline involving the interplanetary journey of ""the world's first synthetic/robotic astronaut."" On <i>Galactic Melt</i>, samples of dating advice (""Brokendate"") or orgasmic moans (""VHS Sex"") served as additional entrypoints, and the standout on 2014's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19006-com-truise-wave-1/""><i>Wave 1</i> EP</a> was a guest vocal turn that had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a>'s Joel Ford sounding like a cyborg <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4116-scritti-politti/"">Scritti Politti</a> (""Declination""). Follow-up EP <i>Silicon Tare </i>sounds once again like vintage Com Truise, but it would have benefited from having more of a focal point.</p>
<p>The five tracks here differ from their predecessors only by degrees, so if you liked the previous records there's little here to find too upsetting, but as an EP it feels like a stopgap ahead of the next Com Truise album. Most enticing, unsurprisingly, are the two tracks shared in advance: the drifting, jittery flicker of ""Diffraction"" and the languid sweeps of the title track. But opener ""Sunspot,"" with its busy drum programming, and the subsequent ""Forgive,"" punctuated by squeals of synth, are of a piece. The closest the EP comes to an outright failure is the draggy finale, ""Du Zirconia,"" which at six minutes takes too long to shift from its high opening bleeps to its eventual midtempo groove. What's a shame is that these tracks do little to expand on their initial ideas, let alone do more than set a vague, unblinking mood for their ostensible subject, the robot astronaut on its voyage through space.</p>
<p>Artists whose work shifts only subtly between releases have some welcome precedents, this year alone including the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"">Julianna Barwick</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">the Field</a>. What raises bigger questions about Com Truise is the durability of this particular sound. From the soul and funk records that became ""disco"" to the varied post-punk sounds later boiled down into ""alternative,"" genres often have more to offer before they've become codified; the homebaked synth-funk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"">Neon Indian</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"">Washed Out</a> didn't really have a name in 2009's deadbeat summer, but popular opinion coalesced around the name ""chillwave"" by the time Com Truise came to embody many of that YouTube-retro style's basic points.

But the lyric sheet to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31974-frankie-cosmos/"">Frankie Cosmos</a>' <i>Next Thin</i>g reads like book of poems on its own. It runs seven pages long, comprising 15 stanzas (1 for each of its songs) and it totals 1570 words, all of which are slyly idiosyncratic, bordering on perfectly arranged. As I listened, I felt compelled to print them out,<span> staple the pages together, and read along, fearful I would miss something important. As I did, I became thoroughly convinced that Greta Kline is quietly writing herself into a vaunted place, one where she will eventually deserve mention alongside poets like <span>Lydia Davis, Wayne Koestenbaum, or Maggie Nelson—</span>anyone who can puncture your heart in the span of a sentence. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The sound on her sophomore album is mature, fully-fleshed, but never loses the unique immediacy of her Bandcamp work. Like those albums, the music on <i>Next Thing</i> is mostly built on unvarnished synths and sweet, understated guitars. The difference is in the clarity of her vision: Two years ago when Lindsay Zoladz <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/best-pop-albums-of-2014.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">named</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19130-frankie-cosmos-zentropy/""><i>Zentropy</i></a> the year's number one pop album in <i>New York Magazine</i>, she concluded that Kline penned a ""melodic reminder that the wisest, wittiest person in the room is rarely the loudest one but instead that unassuming girl in the corner, grinning contentedly at her untied shoes."" In <i>Next Thing</i>, she's looked up from her laces, meeting your eyes and delivering observations <span>that are by turns strange, self-possessed, and dizzyingly multitudinous. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On these songs, those observational powers are at their height. Her greatest talent remains her ability to transform minute-long songs into experiences that resemble hours of intimate and impressionistic conversation. In the first minute of album opener ""Floated In,"" Kline sings: ""Now it would be bedtime if/I could close off my mind/It just flops onto you/Wet and soppy glue...You know I'd love to/Rummage through your silky pink space cap."" It's an uncanny description of two drowsy minds splattering thoughts on each other, hoping something sticks, but the words gently pass by before you've even internalized how weird and salient they are. Even when she paints scenes that ostensibly are filled with private meaning, something universal resonates. In ""Fool"" for example, when she sings ""Your name is a triangle, your heart is a square,"" the funky cubist formulation gets closer to the uncomfortable feeling of naming the one you love than straight description ever would. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a singer, she's perfected an inimitable vocal delivery that is willfully off-center, out-of-focus, and matter-of-fact. She uses enjambment in her writing and in the long pauses of her singing so well that it reminds me of an idea from Maggie Nelson, that some people who tend bonsai trees plant them askew or aslant to leave space for God. The gaps in Sappho's poetry have been called ""a free space of imaginal adventure,"" and it is an apt description for Kline's music: In the momentary disjunctions of Kline's singing, the hiccup between words, a whole life passes by. On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/53-gp4k/1625-frankie-cosmos-outside-with-the-cuties-gp4k/"">Outside with the Cuties</a>,"" she savors the nanoseconds that come between words, asking ordinary-seeming questions (""I haven't written this part yet/will you help me write it?"") that invite radical participation from a listener. Even though the song may end after two and a half minutes, it never really ends.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Her work has a continuity to it that invites deep diving, as if she is formulating and reformulating the same few thoughts, waiting for their perfect expressions. Many of the songs (""Embody,"" ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18087-frankie-cosmos-on-the-lips/"">On the Lips</a>,"" ""Too Dark"" and ""Sleep Song"") on the album have appeared in acoustic permutations in past work,</span> and they make the leap seamlessly. Each are marvelously well-wrought trains of thought, cramming existential questions into the banality of everyday moments and finding something beatific even in the plainest of things. ""Embody"" finds Kline singing about a day where friendship is everything holy in the world, ""It's Sunday night/and my friends are friends with my friends/it shows me they embody all the grace and lightness."" It's a feeling that helps her move past her self-perceived inability to access this feeling herself (""someday in bravery/I'll embody all the grace and lightness). In Catholicism, past the fog of guilt, there's an incredible idea that light, love, and all that's holy can be transferable from one person to the next. It usually happens in ritual, the eating of a wafer of bread and a sip of wine. In Greta Kline's pocket universe, all you need to get closer to heaven is a night with friends.</p></div>"|21765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21765-next-thing/|8.5|Kevin Lozano

The truth is far less dramatic. The forty-something singer-songwriter can't really escape himself or the raw, unaffected sound, gruffly melodic vocals, and pointed lyrical approach that he adopted in the early ’00s when he started recording as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/860-crooked-fingers/"">Crooked Fingers</a>. Instead, this short, engaging collection of tunes feels more like Bachmann getting a tighter grip on who is as an human and as an artist, and more deeply appreciating his past and the influences that got him to this point.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That idea is laid bare in the album's eponymous title and the cover art, which features a picture of Bachmann as a gangly, bright eyed Little Leaguer. And within the music itself, he introduces a broader array of sonic inspiration: the fizzy highs of ’60s pop, the glossy production style of ’70s country, and a hint of British post-punk fervor for good measure. Some</span> songwriters who drink from those wells let their creations become busy and dense, but Bachmann leaves plenty of empty space, using small signifiers—the “Be My Baby” drum hits that kick off “Mercy,” the piano line of “Dreaming” that feels drawn from slow dance mainstay “Color My World”—to do big work. The only indulgence he allows himself here is the inclusion of gospel-esque backing vocalists, but even they only come when a certain lyrical phase needs to be driven home.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The decision to release the album under his own name is also connected with the more personal nature of these songs. It's a move he has made once before, in 2006, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9373-to-the-races/""><i>To The Races</i></a>, a plaintive collection that centered on his voice and acoustic guitar and lyrics that spoke to his wanderlust and his fraught romantic life. Both of those concerns have been, for the most part, quelled: Bachmann is married to his frequent collaborator and touring partner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1241-liz-durrett/"">Liz Durrett</a>, and the long-time North Carolinian seems to be comfortably settled in Athens, Georgia. That opens him up to take on some broader issues.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Primary among them is Bachmann's political frustrations. He uses the true stories of murder and ill-fated justice to opine, over a ska-like drum beat and a bouncing piano melody, that “what should be an old relic by now should never have been/the South is a ghost, a ghost is a lie.” Elsewhere, in the stormy “Mercy,” he relishes the irony of using a church-like choir to back him as he sings about his disbelief in a higher power and marveling that “I've got friends and I've got family/from Alaska to Miami/you won't believe the crazy shit they sometimes say.” These songs were likely recorded months ago, but they reflect current fractious political conditions, ones that have allowed his home state's legislature to pass a bill that overturns LGBT protections.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As frustrated as those songs are, there's also a ruminative quality to their lyrics that carries throughout the album. It feels like the product of a man finally settling down after years of travel and activity, and not liking what he sees. That goes for himself as well. For as much appreciation as Bachmann exudes with regards to life and love, the emphasis is really on regret. He reopens former emotional wounds on the noir-ish album closer “The Old Temptation,” and sounds surprised at his own panic in “Separation Anxiety.” And the album is peppered with references to the dead and dying. Bachmann, who knows more than ever that his time on earth is finite, is going to say his piece before he goes. </span>Again, none of this signals a huge shift for Bachmann. But after spending a long stretch of time playing with his former band and as a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/693-neko-case/"">Neko Case</a>'s backing band, it's good to see that he can return to the mold of singer-songwriter with a little extra fire in his belly.</p>

Amid an otherwise dark soundtrack, songs like “Sonny Jr. (Dreams),” featuring keyboardist and Lamar collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32926-robert-glasper-trio/""><span class=""s2"">Robert Glasper</span></a>, and “<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/computerugly/perfected-on-puritan-ave"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">Perfected on Puritan Ave.</span></a>” best exemplified that fusion, the latter giving way to a raucous breakdown mid-song. The musical integration wasn’t as pronounced as Lamar’s, but it showcased Milk’s ability to merge genres without losing his signature sound. <a href=""https://blackmilk.bandcamp.com/music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">Across several recordings</span></a> from the last decade, this artist has become known for his mix of hard drums and gripping samples as well as his masterful engineering, which makes everything refreshingly clear and crisp. In some cases, Milk’s instrumentals—steeped in funk, 1970s soul, and electronic dance—can outstrip his rhymes, which range from humble bragging to civic despair, leading some to debate his lyrical ability.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For <i>The Rebellion Sessions</i>, Milk links with Nat Turner, a largely D.C.-based band that has backed him up live. The project came together on a whim and was recorded in one week as something of a creative challenge. The results are mostly stripped down in a way that separates them from Milk’s usually heavy compositions. The genesis of Milk’s live sound dates back to 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14619-album-of-the-year/""><span class=""s2""><i>Album of the Year</i></span></a>, a conceptually expansive project on which the rapper assessed personal strife over thick percussion. Only three instruments show up on <i>Rebellion</i>: drums by Zebulun Horton; bass by Malik Hunter; and keys by frequent Milk collaborator Aaron “Ab” Abernathy.</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Milk plays conductor on this album, orchestrating the vibe of the tracks, setting <i>Rebellion</i>’s introspective mood. The record plays like four guys in a room, one riffing off the next in a relaxed environment. The music is decidedly modern, shaded by the influence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/""><span class=""s2"">Miles Davis</span></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/""><span class=""s2"">J Dilla</span></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/""><span class=""s2"">D’Angelo</span></a>, floating by in quick sketches. On “The Ancient Rebellion,” for instance, the band mimics the volcanic opener of Davis’ “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc7qiosq4m4&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL43ECF7DC84EE24B9"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">Bitches Brew</span></a>,” its guitar and cymbals milling in the background, crashing in sporadic heaps. “Electric Spanking” deeply resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/""><span class=""s2""><i>Voodoo</i></span></a>: Over a stomping funk jam a la “Feel Like Makin’ Love,” the vocal tone seems borrowed from D’Angelo himself. Songs like “Burn,” “Take 2,” and “The Knock” float by too quickly, leaving me to wonder what could’ve been if they played on a little while longer. <i>Rebellion</i> is somewhat transitional in that regard, yet it’s still anchored enough to last well beyond first listen.</p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">There’s a strong rap strain throughout <i>Rebellion</i> that brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6195-a-tribe-called-quest/""><span class=""s2"">A Tribe Called Quest</span></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14362-guru/"">Guru</a>’s <i>Jazzmatazz</i> recordings. It has a serene aura that continues the work Milk established on 2014’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19822-black-milk-if-theres-a-hell-below/""><span class=""s2""><i>If There’s a Hell Below</i></span></a>, following the atmospheric “Hell Below” and “Story and Her,” especially. While those tracks were more structured, <i>Rebellion</i> is raw and unhindered, as if the quartet sculpted it in one take. It’s nuanced black music without borders, an extension of Milk’s vast sonic arc.</span></p></div>"|21741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21741-the-rebellion-sessions/|7.1|Marcus J. Moore

Tracks on 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12400-nejitori/""><i>Neji </i></a>EP bore titles like ""Pop Group,"" ""This Heat,"" and ""Sonic Youth,"" and for good reason. On guitar, drums, and bass, the trio whipped up a ferocious, muscular racket scarred with pockets of deep silence—a post-punk template shot through with the ghosts of dub and free noise.</p>
<p>Over the years, they've moved away from the prickly aggression of their early records and toward a sleeker, more measured form, one equally informed by Krautrock's steady burble and minimal techno's crosshatched textures. It's as if they started out brandishing a misshapen lump of scrap metal and have proceeded to hammer it out into a long, linear shape, perfectly proportioned. And I do mean long: Their tracks routinely run to 10 or 12 or 14 minutes, and they increasingly feel less like individual songs than outtakes of a single continuum. After touring their 2013 album <i>N</i>, they decided that the material's metronomic clatter had evolved enough that it merited a re-recording for a new release, <i>N'</i>, in which it's not so much the songs that have changed as the air and the light around them. In its rigor and regularity, all of the trio's work this decade sounds like a tribute to Agnes Martin's grid drawings. It's the tiny variations within their repeated structures where the crucial differences happen, where life dwells. Nisennenmondai might be the world's most disciplined jam band.</p>
<p>Their new album, <i>#N/A</i>, proceeds directly from their last two. Its opening track, ""#1,"" might as well be a continuation of <i>N</i> and <i>N'</i>'s respective openers, ""A"" and ""A'."" It sounds like a teletype in a hurricane. But they're also stretching out and exploring new territory here. Where ""#1"" and ""#5"" are quickstepping as ever—somewhere near 150 BPM, a tempo that requires gargantuan feats of concentration and muscle control to rein in their tightly interlocking rhythms when they play live—they slow down slightly on ""#2."" At under four minutes long, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17982-nisennenmondai-3/"">#3</a>"" is both one of the shortest songs they've done in ages and also the one that comes closest to approximating actual techno, with undulating drones that sound uncannily like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1903-richie-hawtin/"">Richie Hawtin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27981-steve-bug/"">Steve Bug</a>'s ultra-minimal anthem ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4l-cOw7EOo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Low Blow</a>,"" from 2002.</p>
<p>But there is an important shift on the new record: the addition of On-U Sound's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30551-adrian-sherwood/"">Adrian Sherwood</a>, the British producer and dub wizard, whose mixing-desk manipulations blow the trio's sound wide open, from two dimensions into three or four. His addition helps them shift even further from the associations that usually cling to the typical rock-trio lineup—aside from Sayaka Himeno's diamond-tipped hi-hats, nothing here sounds like what it actually is. Masako Takada's guitar swerves between hollow drones and whippoorwilling trills and a porous, soft-hard spray like a sandblaster full of nail clippings. Yuri Zaikawa's bass is either pure rhythm or pure shadow. Together, they all sound like exploding clockworks, and even more so when Sherwood lassoes individual sounds and whips them to and fro.</p>
<p>Against the trio's unflinching sense of discipline, he represents something closer to chaos; to their ceaseless repetition he brings unpredictability. In ""#5,"" gunshots ring out, and so does a typewriter bell; it's unclear what those sounds really are, or where they may have come from. Summoned or not, through the magic of dub, they simply appear. Sherwood's manipulations remain relatively restrained on the five studio cuts, but on two live tracks, he really goes to town, twisting delay knobs and reeling off serpentine licks that magnify the aberrations of the trio's straight-ahead groove.

In recent years, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29384-william-tyler/"">William Tyler</a> went full electric, even recruiting a full backing band. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31339-steve-gunn/"">Steve Gunn</a> has morphed into an accomplished singer-songwriter, now fronting an outfit that resides in the borderlands of cosmic country and psychedelic rock. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29793-cian-nugent/"">Cian Nugent</a> sings these days, as does <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/629-james-blackshaw/"">James Blackshaw</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"">Six Organs of Admittance</a> turned toward folk-rock and, more recently, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20074-hexadic/"" target=""_blank"">savagely electric systems music. </a>This pattern isn't surprising or without precedent, of course—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"">Fahey</a>, Bull, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4935-robbie-basho/"">Basho</a>, and Kottke never sat still with six unamplified strings, either.</p>
<p>Not so with the guitarist, scholar, and erstwhile bandleader <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29939-glenn-jones/"">Glenn Jones</a>: For the last decade, Jones, several decades older than the lot that's emerged in the new millennium, has taken a craftsperson's approach to the guitar and the banjo, issuing a sterling but rarely surprising string of records that find him telling stories and sharing vulnerabilities sans bells or whistles, his voice or his band. It's as though he cycled through enough zany ideas during his time in the <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cul-de-sac-mn0000785651"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wild group Cul de Sac for a lifetime</a>. He is now the six-string analogue of<a href=""http://www.newyankee.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> The New Yankee Workshop</i>'s Norm Abram</a>, more obsessed with making work that will last than work that will momentarily stun.</p>
<p>Every two or three years since his solo debut in 2004, Jones has issued another set of quiet reflections that, taken together, suggest stacks of letters mailed from an old friend—thoughts on what has hurt him and what has given him hope, where he's been and what he's learned. On 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18007-glenn-jones-my-garden-state/""><i>My Garden State</i></a>, written while he cared for his aging and ailing mother at home, listeners shared in his sweet sadness; on the new <i>Fleeting</i>, dedicated to his late mother, he reflects on her life and death, the wonder of a newborn baby, and shifts in the season and scenery. It all feels familiar, comfortable, welcome.</p>
<p>If technique is your thing, <i>Fleeting</i>, like all Jones records, is a master class. His tunings are counterintuitive and mesmerizing; his use of partial capos and muted strings is novel and intriguing. But to Jones' great credit, those only feel like tools for telling stories. “Mother's Day” is a bittersweet ode to memories and mortality. When Jones lets the high strings sparkle, he seems to smile at some fond recollection; elsewhere, he digs deep into low, moody chords, as if sighing at the fact that those moments are stuck forever in the past. The album's finale, “June to Soon, October All Over,” is brilliantly composed, with the harmonies between the strings shimmering like late-afternoon sunlight on a lake and the slowly building structure suggesting a slowly opening flower. Jones slides smoothly down the guitar's neck and picks every nuance from every chord, but this feels more like a confession than a demonstration.</p>
<p>Indeed, every song on <i>Fleeting</i> carries its own emotional resonance. Written for an infant, the banjo miniatures “Cléo Awake” and “Cléo Asleep” are tender lullabies, with friendly, staccato phrases that seem to mimic a child's guileless laughter. Taken together, they barely break the three-minute mark, but the brevity feels like an ellipsis, an affirmation of the child's infinite possibilities. The slow, staggering “In Durance Vile” is Jones at his most irascible. He nods toward the blues as he slides between half-muted chords, and he slinks in cycles of notes that seem suspended in the doldrums. For four minutes, Jones' quiet despair becomes your own, his worry your worry. Then, the banjo of “Cléo Awake” trickles in, and everything is right with and bright in the world again.</p>
<p>All told, <i>Fleeting</i> isn't as distinct or as instant as its predecessors, particularly Jones' 2011 masterpiece, <i>The Wanting</i>. But as Jones' collection builds, making astonishing albums seems to be less and less the point. Instead, Jones is chronicling the stories of his life and sharing them in an honest, open way, as if he's invited you to pull up a chair for a conversation by the fire. You get to know him not as a technician but as a person, perfectly content to get better at expressing himself with five or six strangely tuned strings.</p></div>"|21777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21777-fleeting/|7.2|Grayson Haver Currin

She's offered us plenty of evidence on that score. But she remains uniquely <i>human</i>, and that messy humanity — raw and real and sometimes wrong — is on display as much in her statements to the media and on her Twitter page as in her music. Audiences heard bits and pieces of this on her initial singles and EPs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16775-1991-ep/""><i>1991</i></a>, but it moved to the forefront on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19998-azealia-banks-broke-with-expensive-taste/""><i>Broke with Expensive Taste</i></a>, her sharp, poignant and infectious debut album. Released outside of the typical label structure, <i>BWET</i> was a triumph, however short-lived, from an unclassifiable artist of the new millennium. As danceable as it was affecting, the record embodied the sort of charms that we recognized in Banks’ music from the start.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Slay-Z</i>, her latest mixtape featuring production from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31672-kaytranada/"">Kaytranada</a> and collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10838-nina-sky/"">Nina Sky</a>, is not as hard-hitting as <i>BWET</i>, but it still shimmers with Banks’ skill and personality. Banks continues to move further into new territories in her work: ""Big Talk"" is a hard-hitting and directly trap-influenced slow builder featuring Rick Ross. It's a new sound for Banks, who has distinguished herself both as a vocalist and as a rapper by repurposing a variety of different genres across the decades, most notably the sing-song pop appeal of '90s house. Despite this diversion, Banks is able to make it work, her deft voice snapping and stretching like a rubber band to match the beat and production rather than fight against it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Still, she continues to double down on her love of <span>’</span></span>90s NY house. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18007-azealia-banks-the-big-big-beat/"">The Big Big Beat</a>,"" one of the best songs on the record, sounds less like a homage to the bright, Top 40 version of the genre and more deeply rooted in the real stuff. It is an underground anthem, one that bubbles under the surface instead of hitting you over the head like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12612-212/"">212</a>,"" but it has the staying power of all her best music. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That is the thing about Azealia Banks: she still puts out consistent work, and each release feels like a well-timed reminder of how good she can be. For all of her questionable tweets or political affiliations, her music still touches on feelings that other artists rarely touch: Consider the sly vulnerability of <i>Broke with Expensive Taste</i>'s ""Soda,"" a song that became something of an anthem for misunderstood, creative, emotionally unfulfilled young black women navigating a world that continues to disregard our deepest desires and emotions.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And it is the sort of thing that makes people willing to give her artistic chances. There were very few gut punches as memorable as listening to <i>Broke with Expensive Taste</i> for the first time. And on <i>Slay-Z</i>, there are hints of that power. They don’t shine nearly as bright as her almost flawless debut record, but they keep us watching and listening. </span></p></div>"|21790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21790-slay-z/|7.4|Britt Julious

Bradley’s underdog narrative has remained as genuinely endearing as it has perpetually marketable, and <i>Changes</i>, his third album, feels like his straightforward best to date, the result of an improved dynamic between the singer and his band. If he ever sounded awkwardly patched in on previous recordings, Bradley now seems to command ownership of his songs like never before. It’s an accomplished skill in the world of retro-soul, and Bradley sounds vital instead of nostalgic because of it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Changes</i>’ lyrics are immediately and sometimes overly familiar, but Bradley’s unmistakable voice is the obvious draw throughout. For a guy who has often been affectionately pigeonholed—Bradley has earned a tagline as the “The Screaming Eagle of Soul”—the new album instead finds him at his most versatile and complete. The record opens with a soulful gospel rendition of “God Bless America” in which the singer delivers an organ-laced testimony; the same keys pop up in funkier form on follow-up “Good to Be Back at Home.” After spending much of his seventh decade as a first-time international headliner, Bradley sings about the mixture of relief and disappointment in his return trip. Like other songs on the album, the song is vaguely and upliftingly political: On “Changed For the World” Bradley tells us ""Heaven is crying, the world is shaking."" Half singing, half preaching, he warns “God is unhappy, the moon is breaking / Blood is spilling, God is coming.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Musically, <i>Changes</i> fits squarely into the Daptone house sound, but the session players—primarily from Menahan Street Band but also Bradley’s touring group The Extraordinaries—are more restrained here to make room for Bradley's big presence and even bigger voice. But the album is nonetheless inflected with the referential post-funk and hip-hop drum sounds of  label guitarist Thomas Brenneck and company. Near the end of “Nobody But You” a horn line quotes the unmistakable saxophone from Seals and Crofts 1972 hit “Summer Breeze,” whereas the opening piano-laced drum break on “You Think I Don’t Know (But I Know)” conjures up Freddie Scott’s  “(You) Got What I Need,” now perhaps better known to all as the sample chop <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2902-biz-markie/"">Biz Markie</a> finagled into “Just a Friend.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>Much of the album is about love: searching for it, being wronged by it, basking in it. Of the spare forty-minute tracklist, “Things We Do For Love” might be the most satisfyingly retro offering, complete with a dose of doo-wop accompaniment and a nimble, romantic groove. </span></span>The album’s greatest accomplishment is in its most unexpectedly personal moment though, in which Bradley wrestles an out-of-character <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a> ballad about a breakup into an agonizing paean to his late mother. After spending a lifetime estranged, Bradley patched up his relationship with his mother in time to serve as her caretaker before she passed, and also early enough that she got to see his career finally take off. In her absence and in the midst of post-success family quarrels, Bradley sounds heartbreakingly alone when he wails “I’ve lost the best friend I’ve ever had.” “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18126-charles-bradley-changes-black-sabbath-cover/"">Changes</a>,” and its accompanying video, show the singer at his most emotionally unhinged and dramatically vulnerable.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A few years ago, Bradley’s success seemed more romantic in its improbability. “We found an authentic soul man that liked our music,” </span><a href=""http://www.independent.com/news/2012/nov/21/soulman-thomas-brenneck-working-charles-bradley/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Brenneck glowed </span></a><span>of his band’s initial collaboration with the singer in 2012. </span><span><i>Changes</i> somehow feels more natural, in which Bradley comes off as an obvious star, like he's belonged here the whole time. </span><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">Surrounded by talented revivalists half his age, the singer remains a precious commodity: the real thing. He’s not reenacting or revisiting, he’s on his first run through. And it's still inspiring to watch him live it out at last.</span></p></div>"|21763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21763-changes/|7.1|Jay Balfour

As history has shown, hard-rock bands tend to view their discographies like batting orders, and—whether <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vol._4_(Black_Sabbath_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">officially</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin_IV"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">otherwise</a>— a numerically branded ""<i>IV</i>"" has come to represent the clean-up hitter stepping up to the plate with the bases loaded. It's the moment where bands capitalize on established strengths and set out for parts unknown. And Black Mountain's <i>IV</i> plays the fourth-album role to a tee, rolling up the weed-scented riffage of their 2005 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1146-black-mountain/"">self-titled debut</a>, the prog-sized ambitions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11056-in-the-future/""><i>In the Future</i></a>, and the pop-focussed finesse of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14620-wilderness-heart/""><i>Wilderness Heart</i></a>, all while embracing electronics with a zeal that suggests<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awljN4RaJU8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> the band's relationship with modern music has become somewhat less tortured.</a></p>
<p>But despite its highly evocative title, <i>IV</i> doesn't so much relive classic-rock history as suggest a different course for it. By the late 1970s, many dinosaur rock acts had either <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7isxoTIeYM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gone disco</a> or at least <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdLIerfXuZ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slickened up their sound</a> to compete with it. And through that process, the synthesizer would come to represent a musical cancer to purists, the agent through which the majesty of rock got diluted into nancy-boy new wave and poofed-up hair-metal power ballads. <i>IV</i>, however, reminds us that technologically curious early adopters like Rush, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Led Zeppelin</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> were among the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYYdQB0mkEU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">original</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhe4UOXIQjQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">synth-pop</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt-udg9zQSE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bands</a>, using push-button machinery to expand and enhance their fantastical vision rather than cloud it. <i>IV, </i>accordingly, is the sound of a Black Mountain that holds <i>2112</i> and ""Subdivisions"" in equally high regard, that gets as much mileage out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20668-presence-in-through-the-out-door-coda/""><i>In Through the Out Door</i></a> as<i> </i>""Black Dog,"" and that has upgraded its joint-assembly surface of choice from <i>Meddle</i> to <i>The Wall. </i>It presents an alternate '80s where the progressive, guitar-powered rock that dominated the preceding decade successfully adapted to pop's synth-centric shift, instead of becoming an instant anachronism.</p>
<p>But even if Jeremy Schmidt's keyboard rig gets as much of a workout here as<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6560-stephen-mcbean/""> Stephen McBean</a>'s effects-pedal board, by this point, Black Mountain possess a peculiar personality that transcends their throwback stoner-rock rep. That's in large part due to the singular beauty-and-the-beard dynamic between vocalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8750-amber-webber/"">Amber Webber</a> and McBean, whose unnervingly calm yet often dread-ridden vocals make them sound like that strange, water bottle-hoarding couple down the road whose end-times prophecies just might be coming true. Secure in that foundation, Black Mountain can confidently send their referentialism into overdrive, pilfering their record collections for musical, lyrical and spiritual inspiration but giving it their own subversive spin.  </p>
<p>Sometimes, the nods don't go beyond the titles. ""Florian Saucer Attack"" manages to pack in shout-outs to two <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Saucer_Attack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">avant</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Schneider"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">icons</a> in its three-word name, though the song itself is an exhilarating, asphalt-ripping robo-rocker that sounds like Webber doing donuts from behind the wheel of the <i>Knight Rider</i>'s KITT. ""(Over &amp; Over) The Chain,"" meanwhile, has nothing to do with the name-checked <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMGOg8vB4Dc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MC5</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1iuSmZHcwY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fleetwood Mac</a> classics—rather, its protracted, synth symphony intro lures you into some late-night occult ceremony, with McBean's squealing guitar solo unsubtly evoking the tortured cries of a human-sacrifice candidate being burned alive.</p>
<p>Other quotes are more subtle and sly: the splendorous electro-psych sea shanty ""You Can Dream"" takes its chorus refrain from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FFIFsK1duw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bruce Springsteen's favourite Suicide song</a>; the acoustic-powered goth-pop of ""Cemetery Breeding"" wraps its meditations on dying friends in an appropriately spooked synth riff straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>'s ""Ashes to Ashes."" But, occasionally, Black Mountain can't resist unabashed homage: from its droning, fever-dream ambience to its slack acoustic strums to its drowsy drum fills, ""Crucify Me"" is the proud, pouch-baby spawn of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>'s ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8xPHS-n5Gw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kangaroo</a>."" (That said, McBean and Webber's gorgeous, honey-dipped harmonies imagine what could've been had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28727-alex-chilton/"">Alex Chilton</a> tightened up the song just enough to get it onto late-'70s soft-rock radio.)</p>
<p>When they first emerged 12 years ago, Black Mountain appeared to be the long-haired, tattooed antidote to fellow Vancouverites the New Pornographers—a supergroup ensemble corralled by a local scene veteran that stripped hard rock of macho cliché just as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26449-the-new-pornographers/"">New Pornographers</a> gave skinny-tied power pop some extra width. Black Mountain are still referring to that original playbook: like early signature track ""Don't Run Our Hearts Around,"" <i>IV</i>'s opener ""Mothers of the Sun"" is a withering protest anthem sandwiched by a tectonic plate-shifting riff that leaves a greater impression than the verses and choruses. But this time out, Black Mountain redirect their bulldozing boogie into a funky, soul-clapped breakdown and laser show-worthy synth solo, showing how they've progressed beyond simple rock-and-awe tactics. And nowhere is that sense of patience more pronounced than in <i>IV</i>'s nine-minute closer, ""Space to Bakersfield,"" an airy, eerie sci-fi lullaby that finds McBean and Webber ominously repeating the song's two-line lyric like adrift astronauts whose oxygen supply is about to run out. Where they once aspired to be your blood-pumping <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZpSQNs0k40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">druganaut</a>, Black Mountain now excel at the art of making you uncomfortably numb.</p></div>"|21595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21595-iv/|7.5|Stuart Berman

These days, the band name functions as a chimera-like host for these somewhat distinct entities, with mainstays <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32307-buzz-osborne/"">Buzz Osborne</a> and Dale Crover expressing a desire to introduce even more lineups over time. Their stated plan to add Dunn to the quartet hasn't materialized yet, but—case in point—the band is currently touring with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3549-redd-kross/"">Redd Kross</a>' Steve McDonald on bass as a lead-up to a new album, out in June, that features an assorted cast of guest bassists.</p>
<p> In light of all that personnel shuffling, it makes sense that a newly unearthed collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1741-godheadsilo/"">godheadSilo</a> bassist/vocalist Mike Kunka would surface now, even if it's 17 years old. In 1998, Kunka found himself without a band following godheadSilo drummer Dan Haugh's hand injury that basically put the duo on permanent hiatus. Kunka accompanied the Melvins on tour, recorded the bulk of <i>Three Men and a Baby</i> with them in <span>'</span>99, and the tapes sat unfinished until last year. Upon hitting play, however, you might wonder whether you're listening to a lost album from <span>'</span>89 instead, an era when heavy albums on independent labels came across in muted, almost two-dimensional tones, thanks to production values that verged on demo-level quality.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is a surprise considering that one-time Big Business guitarist Toshi Kasai, the Melvins' latter-day engineer of choice, recorded the remainder of the parts and also mixed the album. But the dated production works as an asset, distinguishing <i>Three Men and a Baby</i> from the increasingly prolific Melvins' recent output. Even though Osborne, Crover, and co. haven't lost much in terms of vitality, several of the riffs here hearken back to a time when the band was a little more content to just pummel away. Nowadays, if Osborne wants to dial-in a high-fidelity version of the guitar tone on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2307-kiss/"">KISS</a>' 1974 album <i>Hotter than Hell</i> (as he did on the 2006 track ""Civilized Worm""), he has the resources to do it. And, these days, whenever the Melvins fall back on the distinct brand of sludge that made them proto-grunge poster children, by default they sound like they're referencing themselves.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But there's nothing like stumbling across a 17-year-old musical snapshot to remind audiences of the fact that inspiration just pours from bands like sweat during the intermediate stage of their career arc. Once a band turns the corner on maturity, the ideas may get more sophisticated or adventurous<span>—</span>as in the Melvins' case<span>—</span>yet there's just no substitute for the intangible magic of a band growing into its strengths while still brimming with youthful passion. The main recording for <i>Three Men and a Baby</i> took place between the albums <i>Honky</i> (1997) and <i>The</i> <i>Maggot</i> (1999), which places this dalliance with Kunka close to the beginning of the Melvins' head-first plunge into experimentation, a voraciously creative streak that includes collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24724-lustmord/"">Lustmord</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/344-jello-biafra/"">Jello Biafra</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1451-fantomas/"">Fantômas</a>. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The first four songs on <i>Three Men and a Baby</i> showcase the straightforward side of the bulldozer-riffing vocabulary the Melvins helped create. The testosterone strut of ""Bummer Conversation,"" for example, reminds us how huge of a debt the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22273-mother-love-bone/"">Mother Love Bone</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28049-alice-in-chains/"">Alice In Chains</a>, and Gruntruck owed these guys. The rest of the album reminds us that the Melvins wanted nothing to do with those bands, and Kunka turns out to be the perfect partner for crossing the bridge between what the Melvins were and what they were about to become. In godheadSilo, he had shown that the bass guitar can function as a kind of orchestral noise instrument. Here, other than on the moody, spare, sea shanty-esque ""A Dead Pile of Worthless Junk,"" most of what Kunka plays on the bass actually sounds like a guitar, while  then-Melvins bassist Kevin Rutmanis occupies a more traditional bassist's role (but gives it personality with his bright, clanging tone). </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Kunka also brings some dimension to Osborne's snarling vocals, which all too often reduce the Melvins' music to an affectation. Of course, <i>Three Men and a Baby</i> traffics in the same snide attitude that the Melvins are known and loved for, and if they're presenting us with any actual insight on these songs, they certainly don't show it much. The album doesn't come with a lyric sheet, the oblique song titles obscure the subject matter anyway, and the overall sensation one gets on hearing this music is of a bunch of guys engaging in playful, sophomoric misanthropy.</p>
<p> Nevertheless, while Kunka doesn't exactly sing ""straight"" either, his comparatively broad melodic range adds a layer of emotional agitation that the Melvins typically lack, even on the albums where Big Business bassist Jared Warren shrieks along with Osborne. This time Osborne, Kunka, Rutmanis and Crover all sing leads in various spots, which gives <i>Three Men and a Baby</i> a loose, freewheeling vibe, especially when coupled with the variety in the music. On ""Lifestyle Hammer,"" for example, Crover's falsetto sounds almost soulful. <span>On ""Dead Canaries,"" a guitar figure that clucks like the palm-in-the-armpit noise provides the main rhythmic punctuation. But when the groove slows down to halftime, the effect is no longer jokey-but genuinely sinister as Osborne goes a few shades darker than Les Claypool as a narrator whose intentions you might not trust.</span></p>
<p>On ""Gravel,"" Kunka kicks up a dust storm of distortion that both encapsulates and marries the essence of both bands. ""Gravel"" carries over into the album's closing track, a pulsing, faux-grindcore tunnel of noise, appropriately enough titled ""Art School Fight Song."" The throbbing sound of Rutmanis' bass falling off a chair channels the recently sidelined godheadSilo on Kunka's behalf—a gesture that heralds the avalanche of creative freedom that this band is still heaping upon its audience to this very day.</p></div>"|21538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21538-three-men-and-a-baby/|7.0|Saby Reyes-Kulkarni

Unreleased & Rare Vol. 2|33485.0|The Monochrome Set|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Tapete']|2016-03-31 00:00:00|2016|2016-06-11 15:48:26.768196|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".16gmolftnnk.1.6:0.1.0.$21537/=1$21537.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>For a band that came out of the late-'70s British punk scene and stuck around (with a few extended breaks) long enough to make a towering stack of records, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33485-the-monochrome-set/"">the Monochrome Set </a>still have a remarkably low profile in the U.S. One explanation might be that they're a <i>very</i> British act: songwriter and frontman Bid (born Ganesh Seshadri) has always loved ridiculing the class system, making puns about London landmarks, feigning embarrassment about sexuality, trilling when he's expected to snarl. He's a wit, but he rolls his eyes at clowns.</p>
<p>You could say the same about the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"">Smiths</a>, of course (and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"">Johnny Marr</a> initially bonded over their shared admiration for the Monochrome Set). But it's also true that the Set's early lineups, especially, tended to channel their instrumental muscle and cross-chattering guitar lines into pastiches of intensely uncool kinds of pre-punk music: easy listening, country, bossa nova. 1985's jaunty fuck-you-pay-me ""Whoops! What a Palaver"", on this collection, even flirts with Gilbert &amp; Sullivan: ""I quote in the vernacular/And edit speech oracular/To seek a phrase spectacular/Like 'piss off, you cunt'/Or 'I hate the queen'/Or 'I am one.'""</p>
<p>Still, the clearest reason that the Monochrome Set have never caught on over here is that their studio albums often overreach and under-deliver. The best record they released during their original incarnation was 1983's <i>Volume, Contrast, Brilliance...</i>, a cherry-picked miscellany of singles and radio sessions with a promising ""Vol. 1"" in its subtitle. Its 33-years-later sequel—shockingly, almost as good—is a set of demos recorded between 1978 and 1991. Some of them were abandoned, others reworked for more-finished records (although only ""Black are the Flowers"" substantially improved on the version here), and a couple were stripped for parts: the music and lyrics of ""The Greatest Performance Artist in the World"" ended up in two different songs more than a decade later.</p>
<p>Like the first one, <i>Vol. 2</i> is a delightful mess. The casual recording quality of some of these demos serves them well: treble and wobble and drum machine play up the sense that even the minor ones have been rescued from the void, and highlight Bid's dry whimsy and melodic ingenuity. (One thing he picked up from his fondness for unfashionable music was a gift for croonable tunes.) ""The Greatest Performance Artist,"" the liner notes claim, was initially dropped because ""the band were unhappy with the lack of a real orchestra""; it's almost certainly better for sounding like it was whipped up in an afternoon.</p>
<p>The album's highlight, ""I Want Your Skin,"" was originally intended to be a centerpiece of their 1990 album <i>Dante's Casino</i>, but not actually recorded for it. It's an elaborate and very clever joke, a headbanging riff-rocker with a lengthy, triumphant twin-guitar solo, in which Bid's lyrical persona feints first at being a macho Casanova who adores blue-eyed blondes, then at being a skin-collecting serial killer, and finally reveals the awful truth: the refrain we've been hearing as ""I want your skin, honey"" actually goes ""I want your skin on Eve."" (The song's stylistic allusions to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14178-thin-lizzy/"">Thin Lizzy </a>underscore its punch line; Bid and Lizzy's Phil Lynott were both among the British Isles' very few nonwhite rock performers, and for that matter, the Monochrome Set's name could be a joke about race too.)</p>
<p>Maybe more than any of the band's other albums, this one focuses on their pop-as-commentary-on-pop songs. ""Something About You"" crouches on the opposite side of the room from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23484-the-monkees/"">Monkees</a>' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUzs5dlLrm0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pleasant Valley Sunday""</a>, exaggeratedly miming its every gesture; likewise, it took a certain kind of chutzpah for a punk band to write <i>original</i> songs called ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" and ""Fly Me to the Moon"" in 1978. At times, <i>Vol. 2</i> is even self-commentary: the opening riffs of ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" and ""Cilla Black"" are close variations on the ones from <i>Vol. 1</i>'s ""He's Frank (Slight Return)"" and ""The Jet Set Junta"". The Monochrome Set has always thrived on combing the discarded past for jewels; it's only fair that they should find some in their own.</p></div>"|21537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21537-volume-contrast-brilliance-unreleased-rare-vol-2/|8.2|Douglas Wolk

It's appropriate, then, that the band have selected white—a color traditionally associated with purity and renewal—as the palette for their fourth self-titled album, trumpeted yet again as a return to form. Ostensibly, all is forgiven, and we can resume our march further and further away from Weezer's awful <span class=""s1"">'</span>00s with renewed spirits. Unfortunately, the <i>White </i>album proves that some curses are damn hard to break.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On <i>Everything Will Be All Right in the End</i>, Cuomo appeared to swear off future attempts at mass consumption, declaring  ""I'm not a Happy Meal."" Less than two years after that defiant statement, he's embracing the Golden Arches, so to speak. Longtime producer/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/690-the-cars/"">Cars</a> frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3130-ric-ocasek/"">Ric Ocasek</a> is out, replaced by Jake Sinclair, an industry influencer who's manned the boards for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/"">Taylor Swift</a> and 5 Seconds of Summer (he also helped them record the dreaded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13656-raditude/""><i>Raditude</i></a>). Unsurprisingly, Sinclair's sonics rely heavily on prominent, over-dubbed vocals and mechanical percussion. The album's co-writers include Alex Goose (best known for soundtracking a Sperrys commercial) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29196-redlight/"">Redlight</a>, a British DJ. There's even a reunion with Semisonic frontman-turned-Grammy-winning-songsmith Dan Wilson on the limp opening track ""California Kids."" <i>White</i>'s personnel and production frequently renders it<i> </i>indistinguishable from the milquetoast beach-pop blaring from the speakers of the half-empty Hollister at your local mall. ""Wind in Our Sail"" and ""(Girl We Got A) Good Thing"" derive their momentum from peppy keyboard plunks, rather than sawtoothed guitars. Apart from a criminally short, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14178-thin-lizzy/"">Thin Lizzy</a>-esque solo on the latter track, Cuomo's joyful riffing barely gets a note in edgewise.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The <i>White </i>album also boasts the most batshit lyrical word bank of any Weezer album to date, and bear in mind that the last record had songs about Paul Revere and the resurrection of ancient Egyptian monarchs. Cuomo's everything-stays-in approach to lyric writing dictates that no allusion or image be left behind, however obscure or absurd it may seem to the average listener. Hence, we've got shout-outs to Charles Darwin, male pregnancy, Dante's<i> Inferno</i>, tiger shark extinction, composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/619-burt-bacharach/"">Burt Bacharach</a>, and opioid-induced constipation, just to name a few. This approach suits the quirkier numbers, like ""King of the World,"" a punchy love letter from Cuomo to his wife Kyoko, loaded with intimate references to her childhood and even her fear of airplanes (""We could ride a Greyhound all the way to the Galapagos,"" he offers.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">The wackiness also suits ""Thank God For Girls,"" the album's contentious lead single. At first glance, it reads like the unfiltered rant of a men's-rights activist, but a closer look reveals Cuomo is having some fun here:  Through a combination of subtle homoeroticism (fantasies of coming home to a lady with a ""big fat cannoli to shove in your mouth""), inverted power structures (""She's so big/She's so strong,"" he gushes in the post-chorus, eying a woman in ""sweaty overalls"") and Biblical hot takes (what if God's really a <i>woman, </i>guys?), he<b> </b>pokes at some of the deep-rooted, frequently-unadressed fears of abandonment and inferiority that accompany modern notions of masculinity and femininity. How disappointing, then, that the song's sharp commentary is overshadowed by an overwrought arrangement cribbed from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Zep</a>'s ""Stairway to Heaven""—right down to the acapella ending—buttressed in the chorus by wan, brittle grunge chords.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The buried lede on <i>White</i> is that it is also Weezer's first true concept album since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal/"">Pinkerton</a>. </i>Rather than the ambitious adaptation of <i>Madame Butterfly,</i> Cuomo opts here for a three-act tale of geek-meets-girl, followed <i>en suite</i> by boy-gets-heart-torn-asunder. From this angle, some of the nerdy name-dropping and masochistic sexual symbolism might be thematic conceits rather than lyrical shortcomings; our protagonist's comparison of himself and his crush to ""Danté and Beatrice"" in ""L.A. Girlz"" is <i>supposed </i>to be dorky, because he lacks the love language necessary to properly contextualize these sentiments. But first of all, which Weezer album couldn't be described at least in part as ""geek meets girl and gets heart torn asunder?"" And when's the last time we listened to a Weezer album for the <i>story</i>?</p>
<div class=""message_content ""><span class=""message_body"">No, we listen to Weezer in 2016 largely for nostalgic dog whistles. We listen because <i>Blue</i> retreads like ""Endless Summer"" and ""Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori"" offer Proustian pleasures in spite of their obviously-recycled frameworks, and because the simpering, sweet ""L.A. Girlz"" is the group's best single since ""Island in the Sun."" We listen because ""California Kids"" opens the album with a smattering of triangle notes plucked from ""Pink Triangle,"" while ""L.A. Girlz"" reclaims ""El Scorcho's"" rubbery guitar line as its own. Most of all, we listen for reassurance that our beloved Weezer can avoid relapsing completely into embarrassment—and by those parameters, mediocre may as well be magnificent.</span></div>

After Lyor Cohen cryptically announced plans to ""bury"" the mixtape, Thug literally held a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63501-young-thug-announces-slime-season-3-release-date/"">funeral procession</a> at SXSW and eulogized it later by saying, ""All good things must come to an end. This is the birth of something new…<i>HY!£UN35</i>,"" alluding to his oft-rumored debut album. The full eulogy suggested what we've known all along: each <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21099-slime-season/"">Slime</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21262-slime-season-2/"">Season</a></i> was cobbled together from stray files in the archives, compiled and released in an attempt to thwart the data leak, which has prolonged the introduction of the Next Gen Young Thug, the one, undoubtedly, with something new in store.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That isn't to say that Thug has been anything short of breathtaking during this run, or that he's grown trite. Some of his best songs have been remastered and released in response to the hack. The projects in this series are all good, but they are arranged without purpose and pushed out hastily in large, uneven packages with botched promotions. The final<i> Slime Season</i> is forged in the image of its predecessors, with Thug turning in charismatic performances over pulsating productions from frequent collaborators London on da Track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made It</a>, Allen Ritter, Ricky Racks, and Isaac Flame. But it's a lean, 8-track offering without filler that moves rather seamlessly. The beats vibrate, hum, and strobe and Thug navigates them like a bat using sonar. The prime example of this is the opener, ""With Them,"" which he debuted at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21542-the-life-of-pablo/""><i>The Life of Pablo</i></a> listening party at Madison Square Garden, where the reverb from his tumbling cadences lingers into pockets of empty space.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The <i>Slime Season</i> series has found Young Thug settling into a particular set of vocal tics. He sometimes defers to specific tendencies, like leaning on ad-libs as structural pillars. Inside the darker, more open beats, he packs syllables together like putty then gently pulls at them. This is as close to autopilot as he gets. Luckily, it is nearly impossible for Young Thug to recycle his sound because there are so many different variables at play; he manipulates flows as well as any of his colleagues and his vocabulary of squawks and yips continue to expand even as his quirks grow more familiar. Something like ""Memo,"" with its mesmerizing melodies, might recall other moments from the recent Thug canon. But then there's a song like ""Drippin,"" which is a devastating display of timing and pacing that even turns his voice into a pure percussion instrument, ripping words off in micro-bursts.</p>
<p>The tape plays like a final installment, going out with a bang and saving some of the series' best for last. The posse cut ""Slime Shit,"" which features longtime Thug associates Yak Gotti, Duke, and PeeWee Roscoe, is something of a theme song. On ""With Them,"" he rattles off simple but effective punches through a nasally mumble. Then there's the standout ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18136-young-thug-digits/"">Digits</a>,"" which wraps the YOLO philosophy inside a 'get money' cliche, moving at warp speed before settling into a strutting pace. ""I been gettin money before the music, fuck Pandora/ I can do this shit when I get bored,"" he says, casually. It's a fitting gauge of his talent and a peek into his current outlook, and the tape is a fitting end to the <i>Slime Season</i> trilogy.</p></div>"|21789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21789-slime-season-3/|7.9|Sheldon Pearce

Stephen Wilkinson's restlessness over the last decade makes it hard to pin him down, but it also makes it easy to keep listening to the diverse pop pastiches that have developed out of his more uniform sound-collage origins. <a href=""https://warp.net/releases/bibio-a-mineral-love/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>A Mineral Love </i></a>might be just another turn of the kaleidoscope, but it grows on you, with a relaxed joyfulness that is refreshing after a spate of more laborious records.</p>
<p>There are consistent things about Bibio, and even though they are general ones, he has refined his way with them to make them his. There are carefully detuned guitars that lend an alien sonority to familiar chords. There are analog electronic imperfections texturing the music with streaks and bubbles, like some obsolete, richly colored film stock. And there is his voice, soft and threadbare as a childhood blanket, to cling to during his wildest rides.</p>
<p>It's just that these steadfast traits happen to be set loose in a slightly insane maze of genres, often time-stamped in maddeningly specific but elusive ways. IDM, British folk, pop funk, indie rock, easy listening, hip-hop, nature sounds, ad jingles, relaxation tapes, church-social Casio jams, and more reform like a lava lamp's globules. It wasn't always this way: Bibio's early work basically mashed up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4970-bert-jansch/"">Bert Jansch</a>, until his genre gene pool seemed to explode all at once.</p>
<p>Each album since then has managed to wrest a distinct character from the welter of registers: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13125-ambivalence-avenue/""><i>Ambivalence Avenue</i></a> was dominated by crunchy glitch-hop; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15279-mind-bokeh/""><i>Mind Bokeh </i></a>was a woolly headphones odyssey; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18006-bibio-silver-wilkinson/""><i>Silver Wilkinson</i></a> was gloomy and internal. <i>A Mineral Love</i> bursts with cheerful, candy-colored falsetto funk, not unlike <i>Ambivalence</i>, while leaving out the crunch and glitch, letting the instruments breathe. The guitars flirt with African pop, blending with the overall brightness, while the bass conveys the tactile, mobile sense of fretwork. There are fleeting mechanical hitches, but mostly, low-key tape tricks color straightforward musicianship, its springy fillips more evocative of the bounce in your step on a sunny day than night, sweat, or sex. </p>
<p>There is a bit of the pitchy dream-folk that always serves as an accessible entryway into Bibio's records, like ""Petals"" and ""Wren Tails,"" a pastoral instrumental warbling on a melted record. But most songs play like breakbeats from late-twentieth-century audio and VHS cassettes that never were. ""Raxeira"" sounds like theme music for an unfilmed <i>Welcome Back, Kotter</i> spinoff. You wouldn't be shocked to hear Jim Croce singing on the fluty confection ""Town &amp; Country."" We also get <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"">Peter Gabriel</a>-like progressive pop on ""The Way You Talk,"" where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5125-gotye/"">Gotye</a>'s voice meditatively pools in itself, and Princely R&amp;B on Olivier Daysoul feature ""Why So Serious?,"" which wouldn't go amiss on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"">Blood Orange</a> album. ""Feeling"" is Bibio and the Sunshine Band. Et cetera. It should feel like a music museum, but it doesn't.</p>
<p>What holds it all together and brings it to life is Bibio himself, who offers some revealing self-reflections in a <a href=""https://terrorbird.com/albums/a-mineral-love"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">note circulating with <i>A Mineral Love</i></a>, where he seems to anticipate criticisms of randomness and anachronism that he must have encountered before. ""This is not a purist record,"" he warns, describing how he approaches different musical eras through their remnants in his memory, however misshapen they may be. ""I think that's why it all sounds like me.""<i>A</i><i> Mineral Love</i> is a period piece, but the period is now. </p></div>"|21551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21551-a-mineral-love/|6.8|Brian Howe

At a speed of roughly 50 miles per hour, the Empire Builder rumbles across the Willamette River and Columbia River Draw Bridge, past rolling hills and scenic landscapes. In theory, the trip gives plenty of time to rest and reflect, and for a calm spirit like singer/songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27605-laura-gibson/"">Laura Gibson</a>, it allows her to pull from nature as it scrolls past the window.</p>
<p>The folk musician sketched the title track of her new album on that very train, as she traveled two years ago toward a new life in New York City. Gibson was headed for grad school to study creative writing at Manhattan’s Hunter College, leaving behind her family and a long-time boyfriend. Maybe that’s why the song—the centerpiece of Gibson’s new album—feels especially pensive, shaded by loss and isolation, with an eye toward new beginnings. “This is not, an escape,” she hums distinctively. “But I don’t know how to hold someone without losing my grip.” The track sets a strong tone for Gibson and <i>Empire Builder</i> as a whole: She’s using the past as a route toward joy and prosperity. Gibson pushes beyond her comfort zone, resulting in her most assured work to date.</p>
<p>There were obstacles along the way. Shortly after Gibson moved into a fifth floor apartment in the East Village, she broke her foot, which kept her at home and away from the studio. During breaks from school, Gibson went back to Portland to keep recording with producer John Askew, who’s worked on albums with singer-songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41145-dodos-recruit-neko-case-for-new-album/"">Neko Case</a> and indie rock duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41145-dodos-recruit-neko-case-for-new-album/"">the Dodos</a>. In March 2015, Gibson’s apartment building <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/nyregion/reports-of-explosion-in-east-village.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">burned to the ground</a> in a gas explosion incident that killed two people and injured 19 others. Gibson wasn’t hurt, but she lost all her lyrics and instruments. She couch-surfed for a while as she restarted her life.</p>
<p>You can feel Gibson’s despair throughout <i>Empire Builder</i>, even as she hopes for a brighter future. She doesn’t wallow in self-pity, instead using her sweet voice to assess her path, pulling scattered scenes from her mental scrapbook. “Now I’m staring at the Hudson, I am humming to the passing trains,” she sings on the acoustic “Louis,” following with “And I no longer miss the silence, but I miss your eyelids flickering.” It’s unclear who—or what—Gibson is talking about (maybe it’s her old flame, maybe it’s Portland in a figurative sense), but she has this uncanny way of drawing you into her ruminations, making you connect with her emotionally. She’s at a crossroads on this album; lyrically, she’s digging deeper to present a rich narrative. On certain songs, namely “Five and Thirty” and “The Search for Dark Lake,” her words feel poetic, wafting in from faraway places, gently floating along the melody.</p>
<p>Gibson reminds me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a>, in the way she needs very little behind her to make her songs come across. Her voice carried her work in years past, but on <i>Empire Builder</i>, the music is more fleshed out. Where 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16226-la-grande/""><i>La Grande</i></a> was filled with charming campfire songs that took a bit longer to sink in, <i>Empire Builder</i> makes an immediate impact: Aided by Neko Case drummer Dan Hunt, violinist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27990-peter-broderick/"">Peter Broderick</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"">Death Cab for Cutie</a> guitarist Dave Depper, the arrangements are strong but subtle enough to keep Gibson’s voice at the forefront. These songs feel more alive, full of nuance. On the title track, after Gibson has finished singing, a faint electric guitar arises, carrying the song to a soft landing. As a whole, <i>Empire Builder</i> rumbles along like that train that influenced its creative direction. The pace is unhurried, and Gibson offers a cathartic tale of loss and redemption, set against a gorgeous sonic backdrop. She sounds newly confident, invigorated, and free.</p></div>"|21660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21660-empire-builder/|7.7|Marcus J. Moore

There are tried-and-true methods to assure that your latest record reaches new heights, both commercially and critically. Lock down some high profile collaborations, concoct a palatable, mainstream sound, maybe secure a promotional sync here and there. Think of artists like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">Weeknd</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4058-sia/"">Sia</a>—five years ago, their present level of stardom would have seemed somewhat improbable. <i>Living Life Golden</i>, the new album from Ellinor Olovsdotter, the Swedish one-woman outfit known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30376-elliphant/"">Elliphant</a>, is a mostly gratifying, albeit calculated, attempt at gaining that level of success.</p>
<p>In her short career (her 2013 debut album, <i>A Good Idea</i>, was released in Sweden only), Elliphant's sound has shifted schizophrenically from dancehall to reggae to synth-pop to EDM to Scandipop. It's easy to see where she has garnered comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"">M.I.A.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"">Santigold</a>, but until now lacked the consistency to rival those more established artists. <i>Living Life Golden </i>finds a happy middle ground where Elliphant ditches the more hard-edged dancehall sound present on her early EPs for a sun-flecked, light reggae tone. It flourishes, while still hammers home a more slickly-produced, pop structure. In a post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30296-iggy-azalea/"">Iggy Azalea</a> world, a Swedish woman rapping in a Jamaican-esque semi-patois has a broad potential to bristle, and it must be said, Elliphant has always walked that line rather dangerously. Luckily, on tracks like “Love Me Long,” a collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"">Major Lazer</a> and Jamaican reggae superstar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23355-gyptian/"">Gyptian</a>, she delivers her vocal with such acumen that it saves the songs from pastiche. “Love Me Long” is a relaxed, passionate duet laid on top of a glitchy, shuffling dancehall beat, and when Elliphant and Gyptian sing to each other, ""Do you ever get lonely / Do you ever get stoned?"" and “Do you ever feel lonely?/ Do you ever feel stoned?,” it's difficult to reproach either of them, because what is a reggae love song but that exact lyric?</p>
<p>“<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/61088-elliphant-and-azealia-banks-team-up-for-everybody-listen/"">Everybody</a>,"" an upbeat, off-kilter track featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29999-azealia-banks/"">Azealia Banks</a> is another highlight, and ironically, it could be Elliphant's low-key ticket to a new level of popularity. Banks' entire career could be described as rocky at the best of times, but recently she's found a much-needed second wind, which is reflected in her energetic verse. Matching Elliphant beat for beat, they sound like twin sisters word-battling during recess, and one could easily imagine them starring together in a bad girl, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVBsypHzF3U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Telephone</a>”-style video. Another somewhat left-field feature on <i>Living Life Golden</i> is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow/"">Twin Shadow</a>, who lends his writing and wall of layered guitars to “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/62617-elliphant-teams-with-twin-shadow-on-new-song-where-is-home/"">Where Is Home</a>,” which would fit as well into his discography as it does on this record. Like most of the album, it showcases the eclecticism that Elliphant has been trying to capture since she first started releasing music. In fact, the record's only true low point comes at the hands of frequent collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>, on a track called “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63741-hear-elliphants-collaboration-with-skrillex-spoon-me/"">Spoon Me</a>” that is honestly so toneless it careens straight past mediocre into the realm of the bizarre. Over a light EDM beat Skrillex could have tapped out on his phone, Elliphant raves on about the merits of a good cuddle, somehow uttering the line: “Spoon me, baby, you can't spoon too tight/ Hands on my boobie yeah/ Dick on my booty now.” I'm laughing, but it's not funny.</p>
<p>Whether or not <i>Living Life Golden</i> will actually <i>work</i> as a breakout for Elliphant remains to be seen; it's not a home run. But it's enough of an evolution for her that it could finally open some new doors for an artist whose potential has been somewhat limited by her stabs at sonic diversity. With the absolute best aspects of her pop musicianship present, a little bit of luck could see her next record perfect her sound even further.</p></div>"|21710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21710-living-life-golden/|6.7|Cameron Cook

He was assisted by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"">the Roots</a> and surrounded by fluorescent tubes, but he looked alone and slightly lost, his eyes gazing blankly ahead. Since he left One Direction a year ago, there’s an awkwardness and inflexibility visible in his performances, as if he’s just learning how to occupy a stage on his own. When he sings the chorus, ""He-eeee / won’t touch you like I do,"" he starts to loosen up, giving a few rhythmic shrugs and meaningful gazes at the middle distance, but as a solo star he moves through space unsteadily.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In One Direction, Zayn contributed a distinct, introspective personality, the pleasing and elastic geometry of his hair, a capable falsetto, and an emotional reserve which contrasted tastefully with the adolescent exuberance of his bandmates. On his own, uninterrupted by four other voices, his vocal can sound shapeless, with his vowels collapsing into mumbled piles of feeling. His highly anticipated solo album is state-of-the-art amorphous R&amp;B, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a>-indebted stuff that swerves in and out of focus like headlights through a fog. But his voice doesn't stand out in it, and on fussy, textured songs like ""tRuTh"" and ""BoRdErSz,"" he's just an additional cloud in a misty atmosphere.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In sparer, more reduced arrangements you can hear him strain; ""fOoL fOr YoU"" is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> pastiche, just piano and drums and Zayn, and his voice sounds pinched and exposed. He sounds lovely on ""sHe"" and ""dRuNk,"" incidentally the most assured songs on the record. There’s a dexterity to ""sHe"" that seems vacuumed out of the rest of the album, his vocal moving nimbly among blurred pulses of guitar and inverted piano clusters. When he unleashes his falsetto, it pierces the track, a crystal tower rising through the surface of the earth. It’s the only instant on <i>Mind of Mine </i>that seems to hint at his actual capacity for pop artistry. There’s also something gorgeous and spectral to his voice on the intermission, ""fLoWeR,"" which is sung entirely in Urdu; he snaps with ease into the perpendicular arrangement of notes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a document of his metamorphosis, from goofy teen idol to humorless R&amp;B singer, <i>Mind of Mine</i> is mostly unsuccessful. It’s not as secure or as nimble as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"">Justin Timberlake</a>’s <i>Justified</i>, and it lacks the three sublime and thermochromic singles of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33315-justin-bieber/"">Justin Bieber</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21248-purpose/""><i>Purpose</i></a>. The album is so certain of what kind of adulthood it wants to convey that it often ends up expressing an amplified parody of it. The lyrics are hyper-focused on types of haze (drunk or drugged) and heterosexual sex; blustery lead single ""PILLOWTALK"" seems reverse-engineered from Zayn singing the word ""fucking,"" a glossy wrought-iron context for an elementary school transgression. <span>In the closing track ""TiO"" he sings ""You get off on me / it's like cheating,"" which is likely intended to sound provocative and sexy but comes off, like the majority of sexual encounters on the record, as dour and joyless.</span> (A clutch of Zayn-era One Direction tracks have a more whimsical and dynamic vision of sex, particularly ""No Control,"" in which they seem super-psyched to have done it with someone cool.)</p>
<div><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, serif;"">The bonus tracks expand the dimensions of the album. ""BLUE"" would seem Zayn’s attempt at a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>-esque ballad if it approached any sort of resolution or climax; instead it just hovers nervously at half-altitude. These uncertain moments are the most compelling ones, perhaps because they feel truest to Zayn's tentative solo presence. Lacking compelling hooks, a unifying mood, or a clear narrative, his debut</span><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, serif;""><span> is oddly inflexible and over-calculated<i>.</i></span></span><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, serif;""><span> Great solo pop careers are usually born when the performer figures out what space they want to claim and leave enough room for the listener to join them, but<i> Mind of Mine</i> is a definitive step away from One Direction towards nowhere in particular.</span></span></div></div>"|21764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21764-mind-of-mine/|5.9|Brad Nelson

Though never really explained beyond allusions to fatigue and conflict, it has become such a part of the Berlin trio's lore that you'd expect a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9371-pet-sounds-40th-anniversary/""><i>Pet Sounds</i></a>-like work of self-immolating vision, not a modest EP of quietly propulsive bass music. But thirteen years later, at the end of a trilogy where tracks have almost begrudgingly given way to songs, Moderat's emotional expenditures have become more evident. <i>III</i> dissolves the group's diverse techno origins in crystal-clear electronic soul music that stands on a song-by-song, not moment-by-moment, basis.  </p>
<p>It's actually not hard to believe that Moderat initially clashed; it was never the most natural fit. They were three musicians at the forefront of a developing minimal techno and performance scene, jamming together by linking their laptops with software they wrote, as it wasn't readily commercially available yet. Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary strung up heavy metals at high bpms as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/"">Modeselektor</a>, muddling jungle, breakbeat, and glitch-hop. Sascha Ring, meanwhile, made fluttering, sculpted ambient pop as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/195-apparat/"">Apparat</a>. Their merger could feel tentative or slanted on the first two parts of the Moderat trilogy, which were prone to instrumental tangents and guest vocalists. But it's apparent from <i>III</i>’s air of ease and consistency of style that they've finally gelled around one vision. </p>
<p>The album absorbs a dark spectrum of postminimal electronic music—the rococo bass and deep contrasts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a>, the windy knock and moan of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>, the sultry lightness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">The xx</a>, the granular whir of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>—and reflects it back. It reminds me most of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29297-jamie-woon/"">Jamie Woon</a>'s underrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15309-mirrorwriting/""><i>Mirrorwriting</i></a>, from the committed vocal performances down to the new age incense wafting through the spare, softly thundering arrangements.  Though it's Moderat's strongest record, <i>III</i> isn't quite all killer. The very <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">Field</a>-like ""Finder"" bounces its vocal loop into the pocket, but it doesn't show off the songcraft found on songs like ""Reminder,"" which might have sprung from a solo album by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"">Thom Yorke</a>. The three best songs allow the vocal performances to lengthen, open up, and gather weight. The best of them is ""Eating Hooks,"" where low wobbles and glittering trills are strung together in a hypnotic equilibrium. It's closely followed by ""Intruder,"" a sincere big-whoa anthem, and ""Ghostmother"" that could pass for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27745-the-antlers/"">The Antlers</a> if they were ex-ravers.</p>
<p>The last couple of tracks are instrumentals that seem superfluous—on closer ""Ethereal,"" <i>III </i>has run out of songs as well as titles. But the highlights make it a must-hear for sensitive electronic-soul lovers waiting in vain for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/"">Rhye</a> to return. It's also a resounding realization of what Moderat is and can be: a band you can relate to, not just a beat you can bob to.

In a little over a year, Ram went from total obscurity as a graphic design student to consultation with Drake's manager and OVO Sound co-founder Oliver El-Khatib, thanks to ""Sweeterman,"" a horned-up jingle about convincing a girl to smoke weed with him. The song is a summer breeze, comforting waves of keys ebbing and cresting as Ram mumbles clumsy come-ons through a thicket of AutoTune. Drake, ever the eagle-eyed revisionist, scrubbed the teenage-pothead chaff off the lyric sheet and presented ""Sweeterman"" as a straightforward bedroom jam for the inaugural edition of his Beats 1 OVO Sound Radio show. Ramriddlz soldiered on without his signature song, releasing a marginally well-received EP called <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ramriddlz/sets/p2p-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>P2P</i></a> <span>—</span>""Pussy Too Pink,"" natch<span>—</span>to capitalize on the sudden windfall of media attention.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ramriddlz has returned this month with a new nine-song project called <i>Venis</i>, and like <i>P2P</i>, which arrived with a suggestively vaginal kaleidoscope of a rose as artwork, the cover art here<span>—</span>a digital rendering of a juicy peach in water<span>—</span>relays <i>exactly</i> where this kid's head is. <i>Venis</i> is full of gooey bedroom talk, delivered in an affected patois that combines humid dancehall temptation and plaintive Toronto sound malaise. In capable hands, this is a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL1UzIK-flA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">platinum combination</a>, but Ramriddlz is hammy, amateurish, and touristic in his approach. His lines are forced and leaden. In ""Play"" alone, there are three clunkers that rank among the year's worst. (""You said I'm cheesy and you lactose,"" ""Let's get wavy by the ocean,"" ""I'm rolling and I'm getting stoned / Baby I'm a rolling stoner."") Another song called ""Baeby"" actually petitions for oral sex with a withering ""Hakuna matata.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Venis</i> displays all the poise of a nerdy kid brother learning how not to speak to women one spectacular embarrassment at a time, but just as exasperating as the lyrics, which are somehow even more bantamweight than ""Sweeterman,"" is Ram's shaky grasp on melody. On the low end, he employs a soothing Drake-ish croon, the same one being run into obsolescence by scores of adopters <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL6et29Hp9o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">around</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUq1rZ7mmns"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toronto</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7cVLE4SaN0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrVMhvKsiTA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">beyond</a>. It's <i>Venis</i>' saving grace on highlights ""Left, Right"" and ""Bodmon,"" cuts where the singer leans back as his producers carry him to the hooks. But these peaks are too often offset by the shrill bleat at the other end of his register, a grating wobbly tone processed within an inch of humanity by pitch-correcting software, one assumes, because Ram can't quite nail the actual notes. When he sails up an octave in the second verse of the single ""Hey Mr. RamRod"" to ask a girl to let him in the ""kitty kat,"" it sounds like he's trying to strangle one instead.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ramriddlz doesn't bring much to <i>Venis</i> that any number of other singers couldn't, provided the right strains of bud and shamelessness. The real treat, then, is the music tasked with washing out his voice, shared between ""Sweeterman"" maestro Jaegen, Hoodie Allen collaborator RJF, and 1Mind. Together, they bring a respect for the architecture of modern dancehall that their singer can't quite hack. Where these songs float, it is because of the ultralight sonics underfoot, not the unsure fake patois over top. 1Mind's soaring ""Baeby"" airlifts Ram by way of a pulsating groove not even a string of bad puns and fake Jadakiss ad libs can quell. ""Venis"" pulls a dizzying hard left into downcast house in its last minute as the singer prattles on, Auto Tune so thick he may as well be another synth in the mix. Really, this is a producer's project.</p>
<p>How much this music successfully entertains is directly rooted in how easily the center attraction can be tuned out, because on <i>Venis</i>, Ramriddlz's shtick wears gratingly thin. Though there are moments when he locks into his production and fires off easy hooks and turns of phrase, a numbingly foolish lyric pops up every couple lines. The aim is slackness, the more adroitly sexual end of the dancehall spectrum, but by and large, this stuff isn't sexy, unless Ram's promise of semen that tastes like Chick-fil-A Polynesian sauce sounds like a good time. If Ramriddlz is going to last beyond the quick, bright heat of a choice Drake cosign, it'll be by honing songwriting smarts to match the lush production he lucked into. <i>Venis</i> volleys between the vapid and the bizarre in search of the absurdist magic of ""Sweeterman,"" when what was really needed was refinement.</p></div>"|21788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21788-venis/|4.5|Craig Jenkins

She roars back, ""Well yes I fuckin' a-a-am!"" Her pride was justified. The underrated Philadelphia four-piece were among the best of their kind, playing knotty, effervescent indie rock that confronted darker themes like sexual violence and infidelity. Shortly before that single's release in late 2014, Zauner's mother was diagnosed with cancer. The frontwoman/guitarist stopped playing basement shows with the band, and moved back to small-town Oregon to be with her mom, and later comfort her widowed father. <i>Psychopomp</i> came together that year in rural Eugene, where Zauner revamped songs from her previous lo-fi releases under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33473-japanese-breakfast/"">Japanese Breakfast</a>. In collaboration with musician <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/g6ladeli"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Ned Eisenberg</span></a>, she pushed them beyond their original scrappy basement confines into shimmering gems.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If Zauner's palette has largely softened, her subject matter hasn't, even though only two songs here deal specifically with the death of her mother. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17934-japanese-breakfast-in-heaven/"">In Heaven</a>"" welds the billowing, shoegazy coo of peak <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/216-asobi-seksu/"">Asobi Seksu</a> to distinct songwriting fit for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3981-the-sundays/"">the Sundays</a>. The heartbreaking lyrics measure the distance between a mother's love and the effect of its loss, but Zauner sings in a forceful celebration of life. When she belts, ""Oh, do you believe in heaven like you believed in me?/ Oh, it could be such heaven if you believed it was real,"" her heart sounds like it might burst.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It sets the tone for a record that loosely explores issues of dependency. The disco-tinged ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18089-japanese-breakfast-the-woman-that-loves-you/"">The Woman That Loves You</a>"" and intimate closer ""Triple 7"" find Zauner playing ""the other woman"" involved with a married man. The latter is one of her characteristically blunt depictions of sex. ""I love a man in uniform,"" she admits, before wrinkling the cliche: ""'Cause he loves me like a slot machine from the valley of loose women in the cruel light of morning."" Similarly, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17998-japanese-breakfast-everybody-wants-to-love-you/"">Everybody Wants to Love You</a>,"" a driving duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31468-radiator-hospital/"">Radiator Hospital</a>'s Sam Cook-Parrott, leaps swiftly from a one-night stand to marriage through varying emotional and physical demands—most notably, ""When we wake up in the morning, will you give me lots of head?"" These songs are never as clear-cut as dominance versus submission, and Zauner doesn't apologize or rationalize her desires, which is refreshing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Nevertheless, </span><i>Psychopomp</i><span> bites harder when Zauner lets you feel the weight of her pain. She turns the lens on herself on ""Jane Cum,"" the record's most hopeless, cathartic moment, where the starry shimmer slips away, and heavy, staticky storms envelop her yearning voice. ""Heft"" is the other song about her mother's death, updated from its original appearance on 2014's </span><a href=""https://michellezauner.bandcamp.com/album/where-is-my-great-big-feeling"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Where is My Great Big Feeling</i></a><span> to sound like the kind of eerie, creeping indie rock that the teens in ""Twin Peaks"" would have listened to if the show had its own Bronze or Bait Shop. Staring down the barrel of her mother's impending diagnosis, Zauner panics about whether ""it's the same dark coming,"" a reprisal of the cancer that also took her aunt. ""Oh fuck it all,"" she sings, wringing out the last word.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's as good a response as any other.

Not that anyone out there expected <i>The Terminator</i> to find such a broad audience. Made for a lean $6.4 million by James Cameron, then a rookie screenwriter and special effects designer with just one directorial credit—1981’s best-forgotten <i>Piranha II: The Spawning</i>—to his name, even the film’s star, Arnold Schwarzenegger was initially cool to it. “Some shit movie I’m doing, take a couple of weeks,” he explained while on the set of <i>Conan The Barbarian</i>. But <i>The Terminator</i> made Schwarzenegger a star and set the tenor for the next decade of sci-fi cinema, its vision of humanity crushed by a malign artificial intelligence backed up by a score that not just dramatized but echoed the sense of a machine army in the ascendant.</p>
<p>This freshly remastered reissue of Brad Fiedel’s <i>Terminator</i> score comes as part of the <a href=""http://milanrecords.com/tag/nicolas-winding-refn/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Milan Records’ Nicolas Winding Refn Presents series</a>, and is lavishly presented, its 69 minutes of music spread across two slabs of 180g red-and-blue spattered vinyl and housed in reflective UV wrap. Such quality production values mean that it’s easy to forget scores like this were often ad hoc, the result of budgetary expediency and on-the-fly invention. Neither a celebrated soundtrack maestro or analogue synthesizer guru, Fiedel’s CV was about as square as it gets: he began his career signed to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4158-paul-simon/"">Paul Simon</a>’s music publishing company and spent six months playing live keyboards for the soft rock duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5826-hall-and-oates/"">Hall and Oates</a> before making the leap into TV scoring. <i>The Terminator</i> was his first feature film, and after an intermittent film career that culminated with Cameron’s 1994 blockbuster <i>True Lies</i>, he retreated from Hollywood to pursue his real love, musicals. In an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GAmD3_FU2g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> recorded for Japanese TV, now available to view on YouTube, you get a glimpse of Fiedel’s sensibility: sat at an electric piano, he tinkles away at <i>The Terminator</i>’s main theme as if auditioning for some Broadway revue.</p>
<p>Still, if the soundtrack still feels special, perhaps it’s because of this unlikely collision: an intermingling of theatric sensibility and emergent technology. The tools Fiedel used were cutting-edge for the period—a Prophet 10, an Oberheim, a drum machine and a sequencer—but still primitive in their workings. This was, just, a pre-MIDI age, so he would synch up his instruments by hand, and you can hear the occasional sense of slip and slide. The film’s majestically dark “Main Title” is a perfect mix of haunting melody and remorseless, mechanical rhythm, the latter in part the result of human error. While looping his Prophet 10, Fiedel missed the complete measure by a split second, but liking the result, kept it. <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/02/the_time_signature_of_the_terminator_score_is_a_mystery_for_the_ages.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seth Stevenson’s 2014 article for <i>Slate</i></a> pins it to the unusual time signature of 13/16, which lends the track an eerie, unheimlich quality: the heartbeat of a machine.</p>
<p><i>The Terminator</i> was a pulp film with depth, one that critics have gone lengths to decode. In 1995’s <i>Projecting The Shadow: The Cyborg Hero In American Film</i>, Janice H Rushing and Thomas S Frentz read it as a sort of Christian parable, writing that “John Conner, a modern day J.C. born of an ‘ordinary’ mother, is the warrior-king who is prophesied to reconstitute the world, to avert the apocalypse through a fight with a cyborgian devil.” Whether Fiedel recognized it or not, his music echoes something of this eschatological struggle: the implacable rhythms and cold choral swells of “Terminator Arrival – Reese Chased – Sarah on Motorbike” gesture to both the ruthless march of an automated future and the cold solemnity of the Catholic mass.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Fiedel weaves around to capture the film’s sense of cat-and-mouse pursuit, shifting beats between simmering tension, lurching pursuit, and brief but precious glimpses of redemption. There are moments when the limited sound palette dates it—see the gurgling, acidic arpeggios of “Matt &amp; Ginger Killed – Sarah Calls Detectives” and “Tunnel Chase.” Elsewhere, though, it feels eerily timeless: the dark ambient investigations of “Arm &amp; Eye Surgery”; or “Reese Dreams Of Future War,” which with its racing synth progressions, harsh stabs and rumbling martial percussion might have slotted seamlessly onto <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"">Prurient</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20463-prurient-frozen-niagara-falls/""><i>Frozen Niagra Falls</i></a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the root of Fiedel’s success here, though, is the way his score holds close to the main theme’s central melodic and rhythmic motifs, remaking and remolding them to keep a sense of narrative continuity even as he shifts around sound and tone. From the metallic march of “‘I’ll Be Back' – Police Station &amp; Escape” to the yearning piano of “Love Scene,” a firm backbone runs throughout, and when the end credits ushers in a cold dawn, Fiedel holds back on fireworks or tidy emotional resolution. As Sarah Connor loads up the Land Rover and disappears into the desert here is no salvation here; just a cold dread for what is to come. </p></div>"|21652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21652-the-terminator-ost/|8.5|Louis Pattison

There is the sheer size of their songs, but also of the group: They've sold out Radio City Music Hall and play larger concert halls (which is surprising for a rock band without a vocalist); they famously soundtracked ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2880-friday-night-lights-ost/"">Friday Night Lights</a>,"" a number of motion pictures, and their songs shows up on dozens of television shows. But their sixth album, <i>The Wilderness</i>, the first non-soundtrack collection since 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15327-take-care-take-care-take-care/""><i>Take Care, Take Care, Take Care</i></a>, feels remarkably small. Shifting inward and turning their gaze toward minutiae, the group still manages to create something that resonates in as grand a way, just via different means, and it's their best since 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2879-the-earth-is-not-a-cold-dead-place/""><i>The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place</i></a>.</p>
<p>Like <i>Cold Dead Place</i>, <i>The Wilderness</i> gives you a sense of a landscape, but instead of a march towards a vast horizon, it feels like burrowing in to escape the cold. Those signature crescendos and climaxes are present, but just as often you find yourself contemplating near-silent electronic details or wisps of sound. On first listen <i>The Wilderness</i> sounds almost like a whisper; as you do dig in, the details grow and resonate. It's like taking a pause on a hike and realizing just how many sounds there are in what seemed like silence. The Austin band has been around since 1999, and you get the sense that they're searching for new paths to achieve their original goals.</p>
<p>For the most part, the songs feel segmented and self-contained, standalone compositions instead of pieces of an overall fabric. They return time again to distorted drums that sometimes feel like echoes in a cave, other times like a crumbling landslide, while the guitars are generally crystalline and precise, sometimes taking on the texture of strings. It resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32028-inventions/"">Inventions</a>, guitarist Mark T. Smith's more electronic side project with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1334-eluvium/"">Eluvium</a>, blended with Explosions' usual dramatics. </p>
<p>""Disintegration Anxiety,"" which opens with chopped sounds, is the album's big anthem, and they take their time getting there; it's the fifth song out of nine. It's fitting that the title evokes the title  of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>'s landmark 1989 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/"">record</a>—there's a similar sense of longing and a beautiful darkness at work here, too. You find the same atmosphere on ""Losing the Light"" as well—the quietest, most subterranean song on the album, it almost resembles a classical work or something by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a>, and it feels like spelunking in the dark and coming upon cluster of diamonds that help light your way. </p>
<p>The music is rarely ""driving"" in the usual sense of the group—it's meditative and okay with staying in one place. ""The Ecstatics,"" for instance, has clicking, slow-motion electronic drums and the same bright, clean guitar as a number of the tracks, and moves in an aqueous slow motion with cold electronics that sound like fizzing water. There <i>are</i> upbeat moments, like ""Tangle Formations,"" or ""Infinite Orbit,"" which at first feels amorphous and ambient before suddenly catching fire. When it does finally open up, the effect is stunning.</p>
<p>Because the group has done so much soundtracking, it's difficult when listening to <i>The Wilderness</i> not to think of images that could go with these songs. Instead of making music for dramatic moments in football games, we're getting sunsets you'll remember a decade later, stumbling first kisses, half-heard car alarms during a comforting dream, that horribly unreal and frozen moment when you first hear a friend has died, walks alone at dusk, laying on your back and watching the constellations with the person you want to grow old with, the calm of seeing a loved one sleep. These songs feel personal. They tug at important moments. It's a quietly masterful, emotionally rich work. Of all their records, it's ultimately the one that sounds the most like the image their band name evokes. But you're watching from a distance, and paying more attention to the person next to you than those colors smearing against the clouds overhead.</p></div>"|21686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21686-the-wilderness/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

He composed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcRr-Fb5xQo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the <i>Mad Men</i> intro</a>, a layered blend of strings and cascading drums depicting the main character’s descent. Then there’s the beat in <a href=""http://www.ispot.tv/ad/A7C5/miller-lite-welcome-home-song-by-sts-rjd2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this Miller Lite TV spot</a>—a brassy number with blaring horns, soaked in New Orleans-style soul. In these instances and others, the composer skillfully blends genres, creating rap/funk hybrids that seem influenced by his living in Philadelphia, a city known for its rich musical history. For the new album, he says, Philly provided a context for all the soul music he's liked over the years.</p>
<p>RJD2’s art is full of unique twists and tough to pin down. His albums play like film scores, launching in one place and landing somewhere totally different. On 2002’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6797-deadringer/"">Deadringer</a></i>—widely considered the producer’s magnum opus—his mix of jazz, New York rap and R&amp;B went in all sorts of directions, but it made complete sense for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"">El-P</a>’s vaunted Def Jux label. Eleven years later, on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18596-rjd2-more-is-than-isnt/"">More Is Than Isn’t</a></i>, the results were decidedly electronic, pulling from the L.A. beat scene while streamlining his vast experiments over the years. Above all, RJD2 is a chameleon—able to navigate multiple scenes, eluding creative boxes along the way.</p>
<p>RJD2 doesn’t deviate from that approach on <i>Dame Fortune</i>, his sixth album, which resembles parts of his previous work while keeping with current sounds. “A New Theory” in particular, with its menacing rap knock, is a worthy compliment to any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/670-cannibal-ox/"">Cannibal Ox</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2850-mr-lif/"">Mr. Lif</a> release. “A Portal Inward” is perhaps RJD2’s best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> impression: Collecting light and dark synths, it’s a long—perhaps too long—album intro ala “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UXircX3VdM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shine On You Crazy Diamond</a>.” For RJD2, it doesn’t quite set a tone for the music that follows, which moves quickly toward festive breakbeats and progressive rock. Much like the producer’s former offerings, <i>Dame Fortune</i> tries to be everything all at once, making for a good listen with occasional lapses. Parts of it feel a little too on the nose—like “The Roaming Hoard,” a kinetic funk track that loses a touch of steam when the vocals kick in, and “Band of Matron Saints,” an edgy rock track somewhat out of place compared with <i>Dame Fortune</i>’s more versatile songs. The producer’s style is commendable, but the album is inconsistent, and the noteworthy moments run the risk of getting lost. “The Sheboygan Left,” a shape-shifting instrumental near <i>Dame</i>’s beginning, thrives from a gospel-esque collection of crashing drum cymbals and choral moans. On the celebratory ""We Come Alive,"" long-time collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33598-son-little/"">Son Little</a> is given ample room to shine.</p>
<p>As the album plays, you get a strong sense that RJD2 is traveling towards <i>something</i>. There's a road ahead that he's yet to endure, a path toward a destination he knows nothing about. Of course this isn't new for the producer. After all these years, it seems RJD2 is still searching for some sort of shade amongst the chaos, a place away from the pack. <i>Dame Fortune </i>is about the journey to some sort of eutopia—which for RJD2, is likely full of bright, panoramic views.</p></div>"|21761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21761-dame-fortune/|7.0|Marcus J.

In the beginning, Domo seemed like merely another warm body to justify the ""collective"" tag; his lethargic, professional weed carrier raps never really complementing the anarchist shouts of his teen rebel cohorts. But eventually he carved out space for himself on sheer tenacity, becoming more technically proficient and simply rapping harder. As the collective dissolved around him, he continued to be its steadiest member.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His Odd Future Records debut, <i>Genesis</i>, is the culmination of his years of consistency, the result of existing on the fringes of his friends’ fame and trying to earn his keep. ""If you don’t like this song they gon’ turn my lights off,"" Domo Genesis painfully reminds listeners on ""All Night,"" and throughout <i>Genesis</i> he raps like it, spitting coiling phrases densely populated with slant rhymes. He spends much of its time searching for answers, trying to piece together a sensible reason to keep rapping. Over the course of the album’s running time, he finds one: he’s logged way too many hours to just quit now.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’d be easy to discount Domo Genesis strictly as a stoner rapper, especially since his second single, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/64222-domo-genesis-tyler-the-creator-wiz-khalifa-juicy-j-team-up-for-go-gas/"">Go (Gas)</a>,"" featuring smokers of note <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a>, is packed with references to the drug (many from vocal straightedge rapper Tyler, in the vein of his appearance on ""Rolling Papers""). But that’d be reductive. Domo Genesis can be a thoughtful writer. His paranoia starts to get the better of him on ""Questions,"" which is a rabbit hole of internal doubt, and he communicates much of the internal conflict with his voice alone, which is cutting and combative. The flute-driven ""One Below,"" a song prefaced by words from his mother, delves into how industry politics have reframed his outlook, rapping jarring lines like ""I’ma take all of mine if they’ve got nothing to give/ The lack of inspiration had me chasing broken ideas"" and ""my life story gotta be worth somebody’s time."" If anything, Domo seems to be sobering up.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The subtle, soulful production, from Christian Rich, Sha Money XL, Sap, and Cam O’bi, gives him mellow headspace from which to unspool his musings. When he raps over the elegant vocal chop on ""Coming Back,"" with one of his most tightly wound verses, his bars snap into the pockets left by the sweet, retreating voice. But there are kinks: Sometimes the hooks on Genesis get wonky, there are portions of the record that feel unfinished (like the second half of ""Wanderer""), and every now and then Domo will sneak in a groaner. But for the most part, <i>Genesis</i> is a revelation. ""I got knowledge for every dollar made, so look at me now/ I'm scared of none of my flaws, they got 'em shook of me now/ So if you ever had a doubt about it, it shouldn’t be now,"" he raps on ""Awkward Groove."" Now that the Odd Future bubble has burst, Domo Genesis is finally figuring out his worth.</p></div>"|21740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21740-genesis/|7.2|Sheldon Pearce

The saxophonist hasn’t demonstrated this merely by playing with a diverse range of icons that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30935-dave-brubeck/"">Dave Brubeck</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp80KUCriNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Max Roach</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11694-cecil-taylor/"">Cecil Taylor</a><span class=""s1"">. Nor has he done so solely by serving as a </span>teacher and mentor to younger talents like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12609-mary-halvorson/"">Mary Halvorson</a> and Steve Lehman. Instead,Braxton’s hybrid-sound identity is due to the staggering variety of projects he has undertaken as a bandleader.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, while recording for the major label-funded Arista imprint, Braxton signaled an intention to play in multiple creative arenas, sequencing his madly accelerated bebop compositions alongside electronic-music explorations. He composed music for multiple piano virtuosos. He produced one of the great post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14299-duke-ellington/"">Ellington</a> big band albums, with <i>Creative Orchestra Music 1976</i>. Toward the end of his Arista contract, Braxton submitted a triple-LP recording of a modern classical piece ""for four orchestras."" <span class=""s2"">(His major label deal was not renewed.)</span></p>
<p>When Braxton lost corporate support, he reacted by expanding his ambition. He began composing a twelve-opera cycle, titled <i>Trillium</i>. Though each one sounds like nothing else in the classical catalog, works in this series do bear traces of European modernists like<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4681-iannis-xenakis/""> Iannis Xenakis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/""><span class=""s2"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</span></a><span class=""s1"">. At other points, </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> has interpreted early-jazz standards (sometimes furrowing the brows of period specialists). And he’s fielded a succession of </span><span class=""s2"">smaller ensembles focused on his original music and growing catalog of ""systems""</span><span class=""s1"">—which often bear mystic monikers like</span><span class=""s2""> ""Ghost Trance Music""</span><span class=""s1""> or </span><span class=""s2"">""Diamond Curtain Wall Music.""</span><span class=""s1""> Some of his most recent concepts require collaborators to handle the intercession of electronics, or to navigate scores that look like paintings.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For those who are interested, this all begs the question: Where to start? </span><span class=""s2"">Picking up the box set that collects all the <a href=""http://www.mosaicrecords.com/prodinfo.asp?number=242-md-cd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">famous Arista projects</span></a> remains a solid bet.</span><span class=""s1""> Those looking for a less-expensive opening gambit can opt to sample the winning run of albums </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton recorded for the Black Saint label, in the 1980s</span><span class=""s1"">. </span><span class=""s2""><i>The Complete Braxton 1971</i></span><span class=""s1""> is another comparatively bite-sized, double-album look at the madcap idea factory. Though there is also now a new contender on the scene for the curious-but-uninitiated. (Or, as </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> prefers to call such listeners, </span><span class=""s2"">""friendly experiencers."")</span><span class=""s1""> And this record hails from a much more recent concept.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2""><i>3 Compositions (EEMHM) 2011</i> is a <a href=""http://firehouse12records.com/album/3-compositions-eemhm-2011"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">triple-CD/download release</span></a> that includes the first studio realization of Braxton’s ""Echo Echo Mirror House Music."" Here, Braxton and six bandmates play their usual instruments, while also ""wielding"" iPods that contain the bulk of Braxton’s discography. </span><span class=""s1"">Each musician uses their hardware to pipe selections of old recordings into the live-performance mix. Over time, the resulting blend of improvisation, score-reading and fragmentary drops from past albums has a compelling, hypnotic effect.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The hour-long performances on each disc often suggest installation art soundscapes more than they recall past composed-and-improvised landmarks like the </span><span class=""s2""><i>Free Jazz</i> LP led by</span><span class=""s1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/""> Ornette Coleman</a>—</span><span class=""s2"">a saxophone mentor who gave Braxton housing, early on, in New York.</span><span class=""s1""> And unlike the environment-heavy sound works you’ll find in some contemporary museum exhibits, </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> miasma is built from a rich variety of source materials that can make misty experimentalism feel fully active and alive. Chalk it up as a side benefit of 50 years spent in the avant-trenches, working to discover new sounds.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On an initial listen to the first disc—aka </span><span class=""s2"">""Composition No. 372""</span><span class=""s1"">— I started out by trying to keep track of all the old-school inserts. I noticed a piquant ensemble march that sounded like recent </span><span class=""s2"">""Ghost Trance Music,""</span><span class=""s1"">as well as the more clearly identifiable, hard-riffing lines of </span><span class=""s2"">""Composition No. 40M"" (as played on the album <i>Five Pieces 1975</i>).</span><span class=""s1"">This endeavor soon started to seem like a point-missing exercise, and after letting go of the effort to distinguish past from present, the overall wash of the experience quickly seemed like the best possible way to experience this setting.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> suggests as much in the section of his liner notes that bears the heading</span><span class=""s2""> ""How To Listen to This Music,"" where he writes: ""Don’t worry about it - have a fun listening experience in a music that more and more is like life itself. Suddenly something will emerge that was composed 40 years ago, and that something will be placed next to something composed last year. It’s OK, just let it happen. This is a ‘dream state’ sonic environment that is constantly changing. I find myself thinking of the movie Prometheus where the cyber hero has discovered an image projection hologram that he can walk inside of and manipulate, or play with."" </span><span class=""s1"">(</span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> liner notes, like his music, can turn sharply from academic phraseology to colloquial joking and vernacular references.)

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Throughout, tricky chorus-writing from </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> operas like </span><span class=""s2""><i>Trillium E</i> </span><span class=""s1"">dances with classic solo-saxophone explorations as well as live-guitar work by </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton </span><span class=""s2"">bandmates like Mary Halvorson.</span><span class=""s1""> Sometimes you get a group of vintage </span><span class=""s2"">Braxtons</span><span class=""s1"">, wailing on different saxophones at once, that is interrupted by the in-studio </span><span class=""s2"">vibraphone playing of Aaron Siegel.</span><span class=""s1""> By braiding together the artist’s music dramas, large-ensemble jazz opuses, and freer group-improvisations, </span><span class=""s2""><i>3 Compositions (EEMHM) 2011</i></span><span class=""s1""> ultimately achieves something that no ""Braxton Sampler"" album has ever quite managed to pull off. By giving us an aerial survey of a large and varied sonic landscape, it cuts down on the cognitive stress that can result from trying to ""process"" such a defiantly diverse career. It’s such an elegant solution to the contemporary anxiety about information overload that it might have made</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/""><span class=""s2""> John Cage</span></a><span class=""s1""> crack a Zen smile.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And if you find yourself wanting more, you can definitely get <i>more</i>. With some artists, </span><span class=""s2"">16 CDs and two Blu-ray discs </span><span class=""s1"">would be sufficient for capturing a career—though that’s merely the physical-media tally required to hold </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> early-2016 releases. </span><span class=""s2"">Two other box sets, released simultaneously with <i>(EEMHM) 2011</i>, appear on the composer’s own New Braxton House label. </span><span class=""s1"">The more noteworthy effort is </span><span class=""s2""><i>Trillium J</i></span><span class=""s1"">, the composer’s </span><span class=""s2"">most recently performed four-act music drama.</span><span class=""s1""> The librettos of </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> operas blend his philosophical analysis of culture-at-large with <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2014/04/10/blasting-opera-forward-braxton/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s5"">absurdist comedic setups</span></a> that often refuse to resolve. That postmodern dramaturgy fits with the orchestral language, which can lean heavily on thick, atonal cadences, before sliding into a square dance without warning. </span><span class=""s2"">(Seriously, that happens in Act I.)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> ability to independently field an orchestra that can produce compelling performances of complex, multi-hour works for the stage is a testament to his impresario’s pluck. Fittingly</span><span class=""s2"">, Braxton cites a range of dramatic influences that includes Wagner, Stockhausen and Walt Disney.</span><span class=""s1""> (So </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/""><span class=""s2"">Kanye West</span></a><span class=""s1""> has company, on that last one.) This recording of </span><span class=""s2""><i>Trillium J</i> benefits from a Blu-ray supplement that presents a full live-performance version from the Brooklyn venue Roulette, as well.</span><span class=""s1""> In general, the CDs in the box offer crisper performances—with the orchestra in particular savoring details in the studio that were missed in the live moment. But since opera is also a visual medium, and because it has so occupied this composer for decades, the Blu-ray version offers a rare chance to fully appreciate the seriously oddball aesthetic of his ongoing </span><span class=""s2""><i>Trillium</i></span><span class=""s1""> project.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Switching lanes again, it’s the legacy of swing—specifically, the music composed by </span><span class=""s2"">midcentury pianist Lennie Tristano </span><span class=""s1"">and his associates—that anchors </span><span class=""s2"">another 7xCD box, titled <i>Quintet (Tristano) 2014</i>. </span><span class=""s1"">This is the release that is most explicitly for the </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton-diehards</span><span class=""s1""> who have kept track of his prior ""jazz standards"" projects. Though for those listeners, there is idiosyncratic value here, too. In contrast with an earlier investigation of this composer’s work </span><span class=""s2"">(the much easier-to-digest <i>Eight (+3) Tristano Compositions 1989</i>),</span><span class=""s1""> here </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton plays not a lick of saxophone, instead holding down the piano chair in the group.</span><span class=""s1""> In conversation, he’s straightforward about his limitations on the instrument. </span><span class=""s6"">(“I don’t kid myself!""</span><span class=""s2""> he <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/arts/music/anthony-braxtons-tempo-emphasizes-the-upbeat.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">recently told</span></a> <i>The New York Times</i>. ""I’m a self-taught piano player who tries to continue learning more."")</span><span class=""s1""> But he is capable of bringing a blocky, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/""><span class=""s2"">Sun Ra</span></a><span class=""s1"">-derived touch to </span><span class=""s2"">Tristano</span><span class=""s1""> compositions like</span><span class=""s2""> ""Lennie’s Pennies.</span><span class=""s1"">""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you’re wondering whether </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> still reserves any time for shredding on his main axe—the answer is yes. It’s just that he’s not currently using his own distribution channels to feature an aspect of his art that’s already been documented on the hundreds of recordings that fill his </span><span class=""s2"">Echo Echo Mirror House Music iPods</span><span class=""s1"">. So it’s up to a </span><span class=""s2"">small Brazilian label, </span><span class=""s2"">Selo SESC, </span><span class=""s2"">to bring us a notable recent live performance from S</span><span class=""s7"">ã</span><span class=""s2"">o Paulo.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Generically titled</span><span class=""s2""> <i>Ao Vivo Jazz Na Fábrica</i> (Google Translate renders this ""Live Jazz at Work"")</span><span class=""s1""> the album features</span><span class=""s2""> Braxton on multiple saxophones—alto, soprano, and sopranino—as well as his regular guitarist Halvorson, trumpeter Taylor Ho Bynum, and another saxophonist, Ingrid Laubrock (who often focuses on tenor playing).</span><span class=""s1""> This group navigates the painting-scores and electronics of </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s ""Diamond Curtain Wall""</span><span class=""s1""> music with the assurance of seasoned collaborators. (A consistent highlight of the first set is </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> interaction with </span><span class=""s2"">Halvorson’s</span><span class=""s1""> rock-ish guitar progressions.) While his solos can careen with rapid groupings of notes and harsh rhythmic patterns, the tone of </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> playing sometimes feels feather-soft. The disparity between the aggression of the melodic line and the lilt of its execution makes for a frequently thrilling experience.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Even more impressive than this protean output is the way these aesthetically diverged aspects of </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> art all seem to converge on a central, spiritual impulse—one that he </span><span class=""s2"">outlined in the liner notes of his 1968 debut, <i>3 Compositions of New Jazz</i>: ""You are your music. … If you try to vibrate toward the good, that’s where your music will come from."" It's a</span><span class=""s1""> simple sounding idea. Though because the world is more complex than inspirational koans commonly allow, realizing the objective can require multiple modes of effort. Contemplative sound-installations, humorously experimental </span>operas, reinterpretations of classic swing, and<span class=""s1""> serene, small-group free-jazz with electronics: the common thread here is </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> curious and warm-hearted openness, perceptible even when his music verges on extreme cacophony. It’s a charming, insightful approach for an avant-garde sound artist to pursue.

The saxophonist hasn’t demonstrated this merely by playing with a diverse range of icons that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30935-dave-brubeck/"">Dave Brubeck</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp80KUCriNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Max Roach</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11694-cecil-taylor/"">Cecil Taylor</a><span class=""s1"">. Nor has he done so solely by serving as a </span>teacher and mentor to younger talents like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12609-mary-halvorson/"">Mary Halvorson</a> and Steve Lehman. Instead,Braxton’s hybrid-sound identity is due to the staggering variety of projects he has undertaken as a bandleader.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, while recording for the major label-funded Arista imprint, Braxton signaled an intention to play in multiple creative arenas, sequencing his madly accelerated bebop compositions alongside electronic-music explorations. He composed music for multiple piano virtuosos. He produced one of the great post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14299-duke-ellington/"">Ellington</a> big band albums, with <i>Creative Orchestra Music 1976</i>. Toward the end of his Arista contract, Braxton submitted a triple-LP recording of a modern classical piece ""for four orchestras."" <span class=""s2"">(His major label deal was not renewed.)</span></p>
<p>When Braxton lost corporate support, he reacted by expanding his ambition. He began composing a twelve-opera cycle, titled <i>Trillium</i>. Though each one sounds like nothing else in the classical catalog, works in this series do bear traces of European modernists like<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4681-iannis-xenakis/""> Iannis Xenakis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/""><span class=""s2"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</span></a><span class=""s1"">. At other points, </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> has interpreted early-jazz standards (sometimes furrowing the brows of period specialists). And he’s fielded a succession of </span><span class=""s2"">smaller ensembles focused on his original music and growing catalog of ""systems""</span><span class=""s1"">—which often bear mystic monikers like</span><span class=""s2""> ""Ghost Trance Music""</span><span class=""s1""> or </span><span class=""s2"">""Diamond Curtain Wall Music.""</span><span class=""s1""> Some of his most recent concepts require collaborators to handle the intercession of electronics, or to navigate scores that look like paintings.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For those who are interested, this all begs the question: Where to start? </span><span class=""s2"">Picking up the box set that collects all the <a href=""http://www.mosaicrecords.com/prodinfo.asp?number=242-md-cd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">famous Arista projects</span></a> remains a solid bet.</span><span class=""s1""> Those looking for a less-expensive opening gambit can opt to sample the winning run of albums </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton recorded for the Black Saint label, in the 1980s</span><span class=""s1"">. </span><span class=""s2""><i>The Complete Braxton 1971</i></span><span class=""s1""> is another comparatively bite-sized, double-album look at the madcap idea factory. Though there is also now a new contender on the scene for the curious-but-uninitiated. (Or, as </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> prefers to call such listeners, </span><span class=""s2"">""friendly experiencers."")</span><span class=""s1""> And this record hails from a much more recent concept.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2""><i>3 Compositions (EEMHM) 2011</i> is a <a href=""http://firehouse12records.com/album/3-compositions-eemhm-2011"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">triple-CD/download release</span></a> that includes the first studio realization of Braxton’s ""Echo Echo Mirror House Music."" Here, Braxton and six bandmates play their usual instruments, while also ""wielding"" iPods that contain the bulk of Braxton’s discography. </span><span class=""s1"">Each musician uses their hardware to pipe selections of old recordings into the live-performance mix. Over time, the resulting blend of improvisation, score-reading and fragmentary drops from past albums has a compelling, hypnotic effect. Prior live-concert recordings of the</span><span class=""s2""> ""Echo Echo""</span><span class=""s1""> concept have sounded comparatively tinny. </span><span class=""s2"">But the studio where this was recorded, which also doubles as an intimate venue,</span><span class=""s1""> affords </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> a well-separated stereo mix that rewards listener exploration.</span><span class=""s2""> (There’s also a ""pure audio"" Blu-ray version of the album available.)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The hour-long performances on each disc often suggest installation art soundscapes more than they recall past composed-and-improvised landmarks like the </span><span class=""s2""><i>Free Jazz</i> LP led by</span><span class=""s1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/""> Ornette Coleman</a>—</span><span class=""s2"">a saxophone mentor who gave Braxton housing, early on, in New York.</span><span class=""s1""> And unlike the environment-heavy sound works you’ll find in some contemporary museum exhibits, </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> miasma is built from a rich variety of source materials that can make misty experimentalism feel fully active and alive. Chalk it up as a side benefit of 50 years spent in the avant-trenches, working to discover new sounds.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On an initial listen to the first disc—aka </span><span class=""s2"">""Composition No. 372""</span><span class=""s1"">— I started out by trying to keep track of all the old-school inserts. I noticed a piquant ensemble march that sounded like recent </span><span class=""s2"">""Ghost Trance Music,""</span><span class=""s1"">as well as the more clearly identifiable, hard-riffing lines of </span><span class=""s2"">""Composition No. 40M"" (as played on the album <i>Five Pieces 1975</i>).</span><span class=""s1"">This endeavor soon started to seem like a point-missing exercise, and after letting go of the effort to distinguish past from present, the overall wash of the experience quickly seemed like the best possible way to experience this setting.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> suggests as much in the section of his liner notes that bears the heading</span><span class=""s2""> ""How To Listen to This Music,"" where he writes: ""Don’t worry about it - have a fun listening experience in a music that more and more is like life itself. Suddenly something will emerge that was composed 40 years ago, and that something will be placed next to something composed last year. It’s OK, just let it happen. This is a ‘dream state’ sonic environment that is constantly changing.

<p>In the 1970s, while recording for the major label-funded Arista imprint, Braxton signaled an intention to play in multiple creative arenas, sequencing his madly accelerated bebop compositions alongside electronic-music explorations. He composed music for multiple piano virtuosos. He produced one of the great post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14299-duke-ellington/"">Ellington</a> big band albums, with <i>Creative Orchestra Music 1976</i>. Toward the end of his Arista contract, Braxton submitted a triple-LP recording of a modern classical piece ""for four orchestras."" <span class=""s2"">(His major label deal was not renewed.)</span></p>
<p>When Braxton lost corporate support, he reacted by expanding his ambition. He began composing a twelve-opera cycle, titled <i>Trillium</i>. Though each one sounds like nothing else in the classical catalog, works in this series do bear traces of European modernists like<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4681-iannis-xenakis/""> Iannis Xenakis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/""><span class=""s2"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</span></a><span class=""s1"">. At other points, </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> has interpreted early-jazz standards (sometimes furrowing the brows of period specialists). And he’s fielded a succession of </span><span class=""s2"">smaller ensembles focused on his original music and growing catalog of ""systems""</span><span class=""s1"">—which often bear mystic monikers like</span><span class=""s2""> ""Ghost Trance Music""</span><span class=""s1""> or </span><span class=""s2"">""Diamond Curtain Wall Music.""</span><span class=""s1""> Some of his most recent concepts require collaborators to handle the intercession of electronics, or to navigate scores that look like paintings.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For those who are interested, this all begs the question: Where to start? </span><span class=""s2"">Picking up the box set that collects all the <a href=""http://www.mosaicrecords.com/prodinfo.asp?number=242-md-cd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">famous Arista projects</span></a> remains a solid bet.</span><span class=""s1""> Those looking for a less-expensive opening gambit can opt to sample the winning run of albums </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton recorded for the Black Saint label, in the 1980s</span><span class=""s1"">. </span><span class=""s2""><i>The Complete Braxton 1971</i></span><span class=""s1""> is another comparatively bite-sized, double-album look at the madcap idea factory. Though there is also now a new contender on the scene for the curious-but-uninitiated. (Or, as </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> prefers to call such listeners, </span><span class=""s2"">""friendly experiencers."")</span><span class=""s1""> And this record hails from a much more recent concept.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2""><i>3 Compositions (EEMHM) 2011</i> is a <a href=""http://firehouse12records.com/album/3-compositions-eemhm-2011"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">triple-CD/download release</span></a> that includes the first studio realization of Braxton’s ""Echo Echo Mirror House Music."" Here, Braxton and six bandmates play their usual instruments, while also ""wielding"" iPods that contain the bulk of Braxton’s discography. </span><span class=""s1"">Each musician uses their hardware to pipe selections of old recordings into the live-performance mix. Over time, the resulting blend of improvisation, score-reading and fragmentary drops from past albums has a compelling, hypnotic effect. Prior live-concert recordings of the</span><span class=""s2""> ""Echo Echo""</span><span class=""s1""> concept have sounded comparatively tinny. </span><span class=""s2"">But the studio where this was recorded, which also doubles as an intimate venue,</span><span class=""s1""> affords </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> a well-separated stereo mix that rewards listener exploration.</span><span class=""s2""> (There’s also a ""pure audio"" Blu-ray version of the album available.)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The hour-long performances on each disc often suggest installation art soundscapes more than they recall past composed-and-improvised landmarks like the </span><span class=""s2""><i>Free Jazz</i> LP led by</span><span class=""s1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/""> Ornette Coleman</a>—</span><span class=""s2"">a saxophone mentor who gave Braxton housing, early on, in New York.</span><span class=""s1""> And unlike the environment-heavy sound works you’ll find in some contemporary museum exhibits, </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> miasma is built from a rich variety of source materials that can make misty experimentalism feel fully active and alive. Chalk it up as a side benefit of 50 years spent in the avant-trenches, working to discover new sounds.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On an initial listen to the first disc—aka </span><span class=""s2"">""Composition No. 372""</span><span class=""s1"">— I started out by trying to keep track of all the old-school inserts. I noticed a piquant ensemble march that sounded like recent </span><span class=""s2"">""Ghost Trance Music,""</span><span class=""s1"">as well as the more clearly identifiable, hard-riffing lines of </span><span class=""s2"">""Composition No. 40M"" (as played on the album <i>Five Pieces 1975</i>).</span><span class=""s1"">This endeavor soon started to seem like a point-missing exercise, and after letting go of the effort to distinguish past from present, the overall wash of the experience quickly seemed like the best possible way to experience this setting.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> suggests as much in the section of his liner notes that bears the heading</span><span class=""s2""> ""How To Listen to This Music,"" where he writes: ""Don’t worry about it - have a fun listening experience in a music that more and more is like life itself. Suddenly something will emerge that was composed 40 years ago, and that something will be placed next to something composed last year. It’s OK, just let it happen. This is a ‘dream state’ sonic environment that is constantly changing. I find myself thinking of the movie Prometheus where the cyber hero has discovered an image projection hologram that he can walk inside of and manipulate, or play with."" </span><span class=""s1"">(</span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> liner notes, like his music, can turn sharply from academic phraseology to colloquial joking and vernacular references.) So, with the composer’s blessing, you’re invited to tune in and out at will. <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/fh12records/anthony-braxton-composition-no-373-excerpt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s5"">Put on 10 minutes</span></a> from a set while getting ready to leave the house. Let a different section score a subway ride. Or clear an evening and sink into the aggregate experience.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Throughout, tricky chorus-writing from </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> operas like </span><span class=""s2""><i>Trillium E</i> </span><span class=""s1"">dances with classic solo-saxophone explorations as well as live-guitar work by </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton </span><span class=""s2"">bandmates like Mary Halvorson.</span><span class=""s1""> Sometimes you get a group of vintage </span><span class=""s2"">Braxtons</span><span class=""s1"">, wailing on different saxophones at once, that is interrupted by the in-studio </span><span class=""s2"">vibraphone playing of Aaron Siegel.</span><span class=""s1""> By braiding together the artist’s music dramas, large-ensemble jazz opuses, and freer group-improvisations, </span><span class=""s2""><i>3 Compositions (EEMHM) 2011</i></span><span class=""s1""> ultimately achieves something that no ""Braxton Sampler"" album has ever quite managed to pull off. By giving us an aerial survey of a large and varied sonic landscape, it cuts down on the cognitive stress that can result from trying to ""process"" such a defiantly diverse career. It’s such an elegant solution to the contemporary anxiety about information overload that it might have made</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/""><span class=""s2""> John Cage</span></a><span class=""s1""> crack a Zen smile.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And if you find yourself wanting more, you can definitely get <i>more</i>. With some artists, </span><span class=""s2"">16 CDs and two Blu-ray discs </span><span class=""s1"">would be sufficient for capturing a career—though that’s merely the physical-media tally required to hold </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> early-2016 releases. </span><span class=""s2"">Two other box sets, released simultaneously with <i>(EEMHM) 2011</i>, appear on the composer’s own New Braxton House label. </span><span class=""s1"">The more noteworthy effort is </span><span class=""s2""><i>Trillium J</i></span><span class=""s1"">, the composer’s </span><span class=""s2"">most recently performed four-act music drama.</span><span class=""s1""> The librettos of </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> operas blend his philosophical analysis of culture-at-large with <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2014/04/10/blasting-opera-forward-braxton/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s5"">absurdist comedic setups</span></a> that often refuse to resolve. That postmodern dramaturgy fits with the orchestral language, which can lean heavily on thick, atonal cadences, before sliding into a square dance without warning. </span><span class=""s2"">(Seriously, that happens in Act I.)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> ability to independently field an orchestra that can produce compelling performances of complex, multi-hour works for the stage is a testament to his impresario’s pluck. Fittingly</span><span class=""s2"">, Braxton cites a range of dramatic influences that includes Wagner, Stockhausen and Walt Disney.</span><span class=""s1""> (So </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/""><span class=""s2"">Kanye West</span></a><span class=""s1""> has company, on that last one.) This recording of </span><span class=""s2""><i>Trillium J</i> benefits from a Blu-ray supplement that presents a full live-performance version from the Brooklyn venue Roulette, as well.</span><span class=""s1""> In general, the CDs in the box offer crisper performances—with the orchestra in particular savoring details in the studio that were missed in the live moment. But since opera is also a visual medium, and because it has so occupied this composer for decades, the Blu-ray version offers a rare chance to fully appreciate the seriously oddball aesthetic of his ongoing </span><span class=""s2""><i>Trillium</i></span><span class=""s1""> project.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Switching lanes again, it’s the legacy of swing—specifically, the music composed by </span><span class=""s2"">midcentury pianist Lennie Tristano </span><span class=""s1"">and his associates—that anchors </span><span class=""s2"">another 7xCD box, titled <i>Quintet (Tristano) 2014</i>. </span><span class=""s1"">This is the release that is most explicitly for the </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton-diehards</span><span class=""s1""> who have kept track of his prior ""jazz standards"" projects. Though for those listeners, there is idiosyncratic value here, too. In contrast with an earlier investigation of this composer’s work </span><span class=""s2"">(the much easier-to-digest <i>Eight (+3) Tristano Compositions 1989</i>),</span><span class=""s1""> here </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton plays not a lick of saxophone, instead holding down the piano chair in the group.</span><span class=""s1""> In conversation, he’s straightforward about his limitations on the instrument. </span><span class=""s6"">(“I don’t kid myself!""</span><span class=""s2""> he <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/arts/music/anthony-braxtons-tempo-emphasizes-the-upbeat.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s3"">recently told</span></a> <i>The New York Times</i>. ""I’m a self-taught piano player who tries to continue learning more."")</span><span class=""s1""> But he is capable of bringing a blocky, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/""><span class=""s2"">Sun Ra</span></a><span class=""s1"">-derived touch to </span><span class=""s2"">Tristano</span><span class=""s1""> compositions like</span><span class=""s2""> ""Lennie’s Pennies.</span><span class=""s1"">""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you’re wondering whether </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton</span><span class=""s1""> still reserves any time for shredding on his main axe—the answer is yes. It’s just that he’s not currently using his own distribution channels to feature an aspect of his art that’s already been documented on the hundreds of recordings that fill his </span><span class=""s2"">Echo Echo Mirror House Music iPods</span><span class=""s1"">. So it’s up to a </span><span class=""s2"">small Brazilian label, </span><span class=""s2"">Selo SESC, </span><span class=""s2"">to bring us a notable recent live performance from S</span><span class=""s7"">ã</span><span class=""s2"">o Paulo.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Generically titled</span><span class=""s2""> <i>Ao Vivo Jazz Na Fábrica</i> (Google Translate renders this ""Live Jazz at Work"")</span><span class=""s1""> the album features</span><span class=""s2""> Braxton on multiple saxophones—alto, soprano, and sopranino—as well as his regular guitarist Halvorson, trumpeter Taylor Ho Bynum, and another saxophonist, Ingrid Laubrock (who often focuses on tenor playing).</span><span class=""s1""> This group navigates the painting-scores and electronics of </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s ""Diamond Curtain Wall""</span><span class=""s1""> music with the assurance of seasoned collaborators. (A consistent highlight of the first set is </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> interaction with </span><span class=""s2"">Halvorson’s</span><span class=""s1""> rock-ish guitar progressions.) While his solos can careen with rapid groupings of notes and harsh rhythmic patterns, the tone of </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> playing sometimes feels feather-soft. The disparity between the aggression of the melodic line and the lilt of its execution makes for a frequently thrilling experience.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Even more impressive than this protean output is the way these aesthetically diverged aspects of </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> art all seem to converge on a central, spiritual impulse—one that he </span><span class=""s2"">outlined in the liner notes of his 1968 debut, <i>3 Compositions of New Jazz</i>: ""You are your music. … If you try to vibrate toward the good, that’s where your music will come from."" It's a</span><span class=""s1""> simple sounding idea. Though because the world is more complex than inspirational koans commonly allow, realizing the objective can require multiple modes of effort. Contemplative sound-installations, humorously experimental </span>operas, reinterpretations of classic swing, and<span class=""s1""> serene, small-group free-jazz with electronics: the common thread here is </span><span class=""s2"">Braxton’s</span><span class=""s1""> curious and warm-hearted openness, perceptible even when his music verges on extreme cacophony. It’s a charming, insightful approach for an avant-garde sound artist to pursue. And it can prove addictive for </span><span class=""s2"">""friendly experiencers,"" </span><span class=""s1"">too.</span></p></div>"|21535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21535-3-compositions-eemhm-2011trillium-j-the-non-unconfessionables-no-380quintet-tristano-2014/|7.4|Seth Colter Walls

While those projects blurred the edges of rambling space rock and synthy post-punk, Public Memory dives headlong down the electronic darkwave rabbit hole, exploring a Korg-constructed sonic palette that weaves together a variety of primitive beats, delicately employed samples (bells, chimes, the weeping of ghosts), and woozy electronics that sound as if they might have been recorded at the bottom of a lake. Created over the course of a year while Toher was temporarily decamped in Los Angeles, <i>Wuthering Drum</i> is a work of restrained gloom—a remarkably textured electronic record whose minimalist tendencies keep it from collapsing under the weight of its own moribund aesthetic.</p>
<p>One of the problems with making dark electronic music has to do with the fact that so much of it already exists. Music that is already so immediately in thrall to its influences often comes off as pale imitation, a weird facsimile of something we’ve heard again and again and again. It’s to Toher’s credit that <i>Wuthering Drum</i> largely avoids goth pastiche. The ten tracks offered here rarely stray too far past the three-minute mark, which means there isn’t much time for the songs to meander or overstay their welcome. While it’s easy to play spot the influences with the songs on <i>Wuthering Drum</i>—there are nods to krautrock, as well as songs that conjure the ghosts of Fad Gadget, <i>Suspiria</i>-era Goblin and early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31808-cabaret-voltaire/"">Cabaret Voltaire</a>—Toher largely succeeds in creating an electronic landscape that is wholly his own.</p>
<p>Rather than provide a series of peaks and valleys, <i>Wuthering Drum</i> is mostly one sustained valley in which the predominant vibe is dirge. “Mirror” moves with all the percussive relentlessness of a chain gang—a chugging beat offset by the sound of shakers, tambourine and celestial bells. Elsewhere, “Ringleader” and “As You Wish” unspool in largely the same manner—somber, elegantly plodding, chorus-free–with Toher’s disembodied vocals floating throughout. It’s only in the album's second half that the inertia finally breaks. “Zig Zag” is the record’s closest flirtation with a pop moment (via a finger-snap of a drum beat and a spooky synth hook) while “Earwig” breaks the sustained tension by introducing just a hint of what sounds like sampled steel drums and the faintest crack of what could be the lazer beam sound effect from an old Atari game. It’s hard to know, actually, since these sounds flitter into and out of the songs so quickly and quietly that they sometimes barely register; it’s only after repeated listens that subtle layering in these compositions start to make sense. </p>
<p>If there’s a problem with <i>Wuthering Drum</i> it might just be a lack of dynamics. All the songs are definitely of a piece and the album provides no shortage of sustained atmosphere, but there is a stifling sameness to these songs that makes them hard to differentiate. Adding to that are Toher’s vocals—a kind of warbly falsetto that brings to mind the warped new wave of an old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27782-blank-dogs/"">Blank Dogs</a> record, or something like the sound of a very tremulous apparition anxiously singing to you from another room. As a result, the vocals hover at the edges of these songs with a kind of hopeless disaffection that eventually becomes numbing, you keep wishing for a howl or a yelp or a scream that might punctuate the airless, suffocating universe in which these songs seem to exist. That is not to say that the record is not often quite beautiful—in fact, the record <i>sounds</i> amazing—but you can’t help but wish that Toher might let his hair down a little more. Too often these songs pull back just when you want them to crack open—rather than build to some sort of satisfying conclusion, they simply end. </p>
<p>While lots of ostensibly “dark” music suffers lyrically from the cliché of sounding like tortured teenage poetry, the songs on <i>Wuthering Drum</i> eschew hackneyed doom-and-gloom in favor of near incomprehensibility. When Toher sings about “an alleged near disaster / long toothed man that runs” on album-opener “Heir” it’s all but impossible to know what/who he’s talking about, but ultimately that’s also part of the record’s charm. The evocative, fractured nature of Toher’s lyrics—paired with the austere sonic landscapes and willful ambiguity of these songs—is what sets Public Memory apart from so many other like-minded electronic acts mining similar territory. When the elements all come together in the right way—as they do on the record’s centerpiece, “Cul de Sac”–the results can be stunning. Over a funereal beat and a lilting piano melody that could serve as a long lost sonic cousin to Joy Division’s ""The Eternal,"" Toher articulates the profound isolation at the album’s core: “I live in small room with all my things in place,” he sings, “I see no reason to pretend / lock the front door / shut the curtains / it’s a matter of dissent.” <i>Wuthering Drum</i> is a work seemingly unconcerned about giving you what you want, but what it does provide is almost enough. </p></div>"|21746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21746-wuthering-drum/|6.9|T.

As influential as his Loft parties were, you'd be hard-pressed to find a record bearing the credit of ""a David Mancuso production."" And while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4976-tom-moulton/"">Tom Moulton</a> invented the <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/chris-wildblood/a-tom-moulton-mix-the-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> (as well as the 12"" single), outside of the Sandpiper tapes, his legacy wasn't made behind the decks. So while Lawrence Philpot was well on his way to becoming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2465-larry-levan/"">Larry Levan</a>, the greatest DJ of all time (at the helm of the most revered club of all time, the Paradise Garage), as Tim Lawrence put it in <i>Love Saves the Day</i>, ""even at the early stage of his remixing career the Garage DJ had created such an important canon that even when he wasn't spinning it was more than likely that somewhere else he was being spun.""</p>
<p>That spinning/ spun dichotomy is part of what defines Levan and his lasting legacy as well as what makes boiling down his genius difficult. Try to put Levan into a handy package and it becomes tricky. Do you capture his DJ sets <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Larry-Levan-The-Final-Nights-Of-Paradise-Pt-15/release/1907942"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in situ</a>? Do you focus entirely on the work rendered for a single disco label, like <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Larry-Levan-Larry-Levans-Paradise-Garage/master/204716"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Salsoul</a> or <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Larry-Levan-Larry-Levans-Paradise-Garage/master/256156"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">West End</a>? Or do you <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Various-Journey-Into-Paradise-The-Larry-Levan-Story/release/660621"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">draw</a> from a back catalog big enough to contain Levan's remixes as well as what he himself would have spun? The strength of Universal's two-disc <i>Genius of Time</i> lies in the latter option, now having the biggest catalog to choose from, be it Island, Motown A&amp;M and more. </p>
<p>The prolific Levan had over 250 remix credits to his name, so <i>Genius of Time</i> has its work cut out cherrypicking them and forming a coherent set. And in drawing on Universal's holdings, it still means not licensing some stone Levan-touched classics: Instant Funk's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1K2Z5Y0Ur4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Got My Mind Made Up</a>,"" Skyy's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09ASfuQhVMU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">First Time Around</a>,"" Taana Gardener's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8jsipjjZR4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Work That Body</a>"" and Inner Life's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF8jL1zyjNE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ain't No Mountain High Enough</a>,"" to name just a few. The disco sound of the late '70s is eschewed to instead focus on the sinewy, synth-laced pop of the early '80s. Nevertheless, its twenty-two tracks capture the slippery, pliant, ecstatic sound that defined Levan as a producer, DJ and high priest for a club night deemed ""Saturday Mass"" by its attendees.</p>
<p>The opener ""Life is Something Special,"" credited to NYC Peech Boys, shows Levan's mastery behind the boards. The set is bookended by this track as well as the most seductive song about growing impatient ever set to tape (""Don't Make Me Wait""). ""Special"" extends for a slow-rolling nine minutes, and it's so expansive one could parallel park in its stereo field. The song is little more than a stately piano line, a synth that spumes like a squeezed juicebox, a rock guitar solo, handclaps so echo-y they seem to come down from heaven and the group harmonizing the title. With so few moving parts, one might imagine it grows tedious, but Levan manipulates everything so that each sound strides towards you and then veers away, cruising you yet remaining ever elusive. As it continues to unfold, the song sublimates so as to be a mantra of uplift. In hindsight of the AIDS epidemic that would soon ravage the Garage's audience and owner (not to mention Keith Haring, who designed the Peech Boys's album cover), decades later it sounds more and more like a song of resistance and resilience in the face of impending death.</p>
<p>As a gay African-American making his dancefloors writhe as one, Levan's sets often highlighted R&amp;B divas, so it makes sense that his production skills were at their finest when he partnered with female singers. Esther Williams's ""I'll Be Your Pleasure"" is the most classic disco of the set and Levan adds a lavish swirl of strings and percussion to her husky voice. With a rollicking piano, rattling tambourine and tricky-metered hiccup right at the song's chorus, he teases out the gospel, R&amp;B, soul and jazz roots of Dee Dee Bridgewater's voice on ""Bad For Me."" For Syreeta, the onetime wife of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>, ""Can't Shake Your Love"" shows Levan at his spry best, adding bass squelches, sax squeals, rolling piano and synth lines that fidget like five year-olds on a church pew.</p>
<p>Levan's greatest muse, though, was Gwen Guthrie, and the mini-LP <i>Padlock</i> epitomized the sound of the Garage. Smooth, subtle, never one to over-sentimentalize her lines, Guthrie found the perfect foil in Levan, who remixed the tapes of Guthrie at Compass Point (already boasting a formidable band in Sly &amp; Robbie, Wally Badarou and Steve Stanley) to sublime effect. The four tracks presented here are bright and shadowy, psychedelic yet body-moving, seductive and ebullient, cool and sultry. You'll never regard a PB&amp;J sandwich the same way after hearing Gwen Guthrie purr: ""Spread yourself over me like peanut butter."" It's one of the finest amalgams of singer and producer of that decade, equivocal to Jellybean with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10541-janet-jackson/"">Janet</a> with Jam &amp; Lewis. </p>
<p>It was short-lived however, and as the decade wore on, the closing of the Paradise Garage and the high human cost of AIDS began to take a toll on Levan's psyche and work (along with his ravenous heroin habit). But as <i>Genius of Time</i> shows a new generation of dance fans, Levan was a singular talent. As Moulton put it: ""He had the feel. He would always sacrifice the technical if it meant that he could have the feel, and that's the most important thing in music."" You can feel that in every track here. </p></div>"|21656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21656-genius-of-time/|8.8|Andy Beta

This is the central anomaly of the brilliant and brave <i>Slow Forever</i>, the first album in seven years from the reborn metal duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33555-cobalt/"">Cobalt</a>. For a decade, Cobalt made mad, warped dashes through black metal, summoning the spirit and language of hero Ernest Hemingway alongside the imagery and intensity of singer Phil McSorley’s stints in the U.S. Army. But without McSorley, Cobalt has opened its sound, fully embracing the blues, country, hardcore, and hard rock strains that have long been latent in its music. <i>Slow Forever </i>is as accessible as it is aggressive, with magnetic hooks, shout-along mantras, and sparkling riffs all anchoring this eighty-minute maelstrom. It is an electrifying, enthralling opus.</p>
<p>Two years ago, it seemed Cobalt would never make another record. Half a decade had passed since the pair’s landmark <a href=""https://profoundlorerecords.bandcamp.com/album/gin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Gin</i></a>, when, in March 2014, McSorley announced he was out; a month later, he was back in, set to work on new material with childhood friend and Cobalt co-founder Erik Wunder. But in December of that year, McSorley took a series of brutally misogynistic, homophobic online shots at other bands. <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/12/16/cobalt-set-new-record-shortest-reunion-ever/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wunder cut him loose. </a>In retrospect, it seems like serendipity, as Lord Mantis, Charlie Fell’s manic sludge band from Chicago, <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2015/03/12/exclusive-lord-mantis-ex-frontman-charlie-fell-band-blow/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">was publicly splitting at the seams, too.</a> Wunder asked Fell—""the only guy that came to mind when I thought about somebody who could replace Phil,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/9837-cobalts-primal-enlightenment/"" target=""_blank"">he has said</a>—to enlist. They spent the third quarter of 2015 reinventing Cobalt in a Colorado recording studio.</p>
<p>Those fraught beginnings ripple through <i>Slow Forever</i>, where the songs stem from abject depravity, or from a mindset where nothing goes right and hope is only a useless four-letter word. Images of drug abuse, sexual frustration, emotional exhaustion, self-mutilation, wanton violence, and outright dejection flash by one by one, suggesting a Charles Bukowski biopic produced by David Cronenberg. ""I am not a man/I am just a dog,"" Fell shrieks and repeats above clattering drums and bullying guitars within the first six minutes. ""Condone the act of self-destruction,"" he roars much later, with militant drums and a clarion riff buttressing his pronouncement. ""A ritual/And bury it, bury it in the veins of lovers."" Fell paints a sort of cosmic portrait with these very human flaws and faults. These failures—the ""pinnacle of the archetype,"" as he puts it at one point—are the natural order, the way it will always be. ""The past in a pile of ash, forgotten in the cycle,"" he offers by way of summary.</p>
<p>Even during instrumental interludes and extended introductions, Cobalt seems to be preparing for conflict, for coming face-to face with the demons inside Fell’s words. ""Beast Whip,"" a song about perpetual dissatisfaction, batters its subject with a series of blast beats and D-beats; Fell seems to be screaming at his own thoughts, demanding more from himself. When ""Elephant Graveyard"" takes up the cycle of addiction, the music illustrates the mania by inciting a circle pit before fading into a long, slow comedown. </p>
<p>Fell is more versatile and nuanced than McSorley, his predecessor. His work here even suggests a range and finesse that his time in Lord Mantis didn’t, firmly establishing him as one of metal’s great new vocalists. During ""Cold Breaker,"" he launches from a hardcore yammer to a doom-metal roar, alternately summoning the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1266-dead-kennedys/"">Dead Kennedys</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32290-eyehategod/"">Eyehategod</a> as the music shifts around him. When he emits pained, animalistic screams or haunting, ghostly yells, he’s horror-film terrifying. But he’s not averse to fists-up, muscles-clenched chants, either, and those are what make <i>Slow Forever </i>so unexpectedly approachable. For ""King Rust,"" he returns to a credo—""Hoisting myself out of myself,"" shouted in a staccato clip and enunciated so that it sticks. It feels motivational, inspiring. ""Ruiner"" hinges on a duet between Fell’s voice and Wunder’s winding riff, the two trading lines like they’re in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14178-thin-lizzy/"">Thin Lizzy</a>. Of all the things Cobalt or Lord Mantis ever were, ""catchy"" was never one of them. On <i>Slow Forever</i>, Wunder and Fell, gleefully grim, stumble into that territory. </p>
<p>Cobalt’s albums have always depended upon a sense of ultimate urgency—life or death, do or die, kill or be killed. Because of the circumstances around its creation, <i>Slow Forever</i> felt that way before it was finished; had Wunder bungled Cobalt’s restart without McSorley, he would have looked like the fool who just didn’t know when or how to stop. <i>Slow Forever</i> thrives in that existential anxiety, as though Wunder and Fell realized they had a lot to lose but even more to gain. As surprising as it may seem for an album where death, despair, and destruction linger in every word, Cobalt gambled on resurrection and, against the odds, advanced.</p></div>"|21685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21685-cobalt-slow-forever/|8.4|Grayson Haver Currin

The unassuming title, <i>Scenes 2012-2015</i>, suggests a hodgepodge; it also suggests that the material inside is old news (and there's nothing worse in electronic music, which is generally thought to evolve at lightning speed). Likewise, the project's generic-sounding alias, with its air of anonymous work-for-hire, sounds less like an artist's name than an obscure bit of metadata, and it leaves out any indication that White Material's Alvin Aronson and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32849-galcher-lustwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Galcher Lustwerk</a> are involved, despite the substantial weight that the latter's name carries as one of the most hotly buzzed-about artists in recent underground American dance music.</p>
<p>But <i>Scenes 2012-2015</i>, which the two RISD grads recorded over three years in a handful of home studios around New York,<i> </i>is no hodgepodge. It's a proper album—the kind that conventional wisdom says that dance music is no good at producing. It's got a beginning, a middle, and an end, and its A and B sides tell slightly different stories; it's meant to be listened to in one sitting, all the way through. And while the album's nine tracks are plenty diverse, encompassing ambient sketches, techno and electro patterns pitched at a wide range of tempos, and even a flickering, 144-BPM study in juke's full-throttle skip, they're also unusually cohesive. They make do with a pared-down set of sounds that give the impression of coming from a modest set of gear, and they avoid samples, advanced digital sound design, and intricate computer trickery in favor of long, linear synthesizer and drum machine patterns, loosely and elegantly woven together. The palette is muted but not self-consciously lo-fi, and the mood oscillates between dreamy and melancholy, though not without a playful undercurrent.</p>
<p>Unlike Lustwerk's music, all nine tracks are instrumental, aside from the occasional garbled hint of ring-modulated speech buried deep in the mix, like an intercepted transmission from across the cosmos. The two musicians' respective styles surface in shifting proportions: ""Above the Waves,"" with its squelchy funk bass and almost jazzy Rhodes keys, recalls Lustwerk's solo productions; ""ITCZ,"" a fuzzed-out daydream for wispy chords and a clunky vintage CR-78 drum machine, shares the hazy vibes of Aronson's ""<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/alvin-aronson/fog-city"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fog City</a>,"" from last year's <i>City </i>EP. What predominates is their shared appreciation for ’90s electronic music: Much of the album brings to mind the sound of R&amp;S Records and its Apollo sub-label from the mid ’90s, when artists like Ken Ishii and Biosphere were fusing ambient and techno in exciting ways. ""Session"" has the crisp, sparkling quality of artists like Morgan Geist and Titonton Duvanté; the stunning ""Whitesands,"" which closes the album with a moody swirl of plangent fifths and crunchy percussion, might be a lost Aphex Twin or Autechre demo circa 1994.</p>
<p>The centerpieces of the album are ""ITCZ"" and ""Unnatural City,"" which spin mechanical clatter, shimmering chords, and deep-diving bass frequencies—in the latter, there's no bassline to speak of, just an 808 kick plunging unfathomably low—into sedate, hypnotic configurations. ""ITCZ,"" rolling out ceaseless <i>son clave</i> rhythms, is plodding and steady, while ""Unnatural City"" moves at a fleet, rolling clip, but what they share in common is an unusual balance between stasis and dynamism. No single element dominates; every sound has equal weight, from quicksilver pings to chalky snares. They're not so much songs as spatial fields: You enter and walk around, admiring the ingenious architecture, and five minutes later, you leave—albeit somewhat reluctantly. But Aronson and Lustwerk are smart enough to know when to hold back, and as a result, they've come up with one of the year's most generously proportioned techno long-players—one far more sumptuous than its modest profile would ever suggest.</p></div>"|21625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21625-scenes-2012-2015/|8.1|Philip Sherburne

He is the kind of musician that has been dissected, questioned, and subject to the wildest interpretations, theorizing, and speculation. Even as he invites all this, Blunt remains nearly impervious to any kind neat conclusion. And on April Fools day of this year, like only Dean Blunt would do, he is releasing a new album called<i> BBF: Hosted by DJ Escrow</i>, under the banner of a possibly fictitious group called Babyfather. It is over 50 minutes long and stretches to an impossible 23 tracks. It brandishes a jaw dropping pièce de résistance of a cover depicting a Union Jack-decaled hoverboard overlooking a hazy London skyline.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From the title, it seems that Blunt is playing an obscure joke of some kind, maybe flicking his nose at the mixtape culture found on Datpiff and Livemixtapes. In <i>BBF</i>, Blunt (I think) alternates between a high-pitched Quasimoto-esque flow and his low baritone drawl. The squealing rap voice that haunts most of this album delivers some of the most important moments, specifically a refrain that occurs three times (""Stealth,"" ""Stealth Intro,"" and ""Stealth Outro"") in the album: ""This makes me proud to be British."" This line is repeated over and over and over  again, surrounded by a wash of saccharine strings, and it verges on numbing. This refrain opens up the album, and it stretches on painfully for several minutes, a point at which most sane people would just stop listening.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The rest of album splits itself between two attitudes, a stream-of-consciousness confessional and a potpourri of ironic tropes directed at American hip-hop. It boasts some very snazzy features, namely appearances from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27685-micachu/"">Micachu</a>. But these tracks are red herrings; they prick the interest of someone scanning the tracklist, but for the most part are extremely forgettable. In ""Killuminati"" he repeats ""another one,"" an obvious joking nod to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4873-dj-khaled/"">DJ Khaled</a>. He hints at ""exclusives"" in ""Prolific Demons"" and tries on a mask of bravado in ""Meditations"" [ft. Arca]:  ""20 bands everyone can see/20 bands don't stand for me/20 bands got me up in the sky...Get these white girls out of my home."" This for the most part does not work for Blunt, and the theme takes up more than half of the album. It might be the album’s narrative thrust and conceptual core, but like a lot of Blunt’s concepts, it’s overstated and hangs very loosely.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When Blunt does make himself available and emotive it’s hard to ignore. These are the spots where the album starts to work. On ""Escrow 3"" he admits ""trust is a luxury I cannot afford"" and he doubts the veracity of his friendships: ""I couldn't tell who was real and who wasn't.""  His voice almost cracks as he asks ""If I die/would you cry?"" It's cathartic and feels vaguely shameful to be witnessing. The moment underscores that beneath the irony, this is as vulnerable Blunt has ever been. It is a painfully raw, emotionally generous, politically charged,  intensely intelligent, sometimes unlistenable album.The project is, most of all, a fascinating peek into the psyche of man who we are still miles away from understanding, and when I listen to I can only see a man in the distance getting farther and farther as I try to get closer.</p></div>"|21702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21702-bbf-hosted-by-dj-escrow/|6.0|Kevin Lozano

Frere-Jones made a very compelling case that the two, while incommensurably disparate musically speaking, were enviably talented and more similar than we’d like to realize, ultimately deciding that they were “both worth hearing.” But that same argument could not be made in 2016. At this point, Bieber is shifting rapidly, releasing vibrant pop songs carved from strange and infectious sounds, while Akita is mired in some very old tropes.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Akita’s latest record, <i>Kouen Kyoudai</i>, is a collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33537-eiko-ishibashi/"">Eiko Ishibashi</a>, a Japanese singer and multi-instrumentalist who has released two <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O’Rourke</a>-produced albums of languorous J-pop over the last few years. According to the artists, the two tracks that compose this album, “Slide” and “Junglegym,” can be read as “contemporary takes on the avant-garde”—an increasingly meaningless marker often used by artists who want to paint themselves as utterly tasteful outsiders. They also stress that the tension of the music comes from “the human use of the tool” which is “made explicit as these works unfold in a storm of ecstatic human/instrument/interaction.” These pretentious statements create an air of importance, suggesting the album only gains weight from its textural presentation. As for the music itself, it fails to live up to the way it’s offered.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Kouen Kyoudai</i>’s two tracks both run more than 18 minutes, and there is very little that distinguishes them other than the main analog instrument accompanying the field of noise. For “Slide” it's a drum set; for “Junglegym” a piano. But both are generally diminished by Akita’s noodling drone sounds, which hog up too much space, making it seem like Eiko’s contributions were little more than an afterthought. In this case, the forceful drone is like the sonic equivalent of manspreading between subway seats. As the album wears on unchanged through almost 40 minutes, it sounds more like an amorphous chunk of noises than an exploration of contemporary avant-garde.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s a shame too. For decades, Akita’s music has been chipping away at an allusive and important thesis: That music created with his array of <a href=""http://www.esoterra.org/merzbow.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">noise-making tools</span></a> can be life-affirming and express sublimity from such raw and uncontrollable forces. But a lofty presentation can create lofty expectations from a consumer of art. As such, the entire apparatus revolving around <i>Kouen Kyoudai</i> did it in. The album expects to be taken seriously. It demands to be evaluated under a different aesthetic criteria by pure virtue of its gravity. These demands could be met and accepted if the music here was more than a tired retread of endless philosophical dead-ends alongside a smattering of flashy noises.</span></p></div>"|21641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21641-kouen-kyoudai/|5.1|Kevin Lozano

The songs are simple, unfussy, and full of space, with a low-key mood meant less for a raucous house party and more for a casual basement hangout. Kamaiyah’s calling-card song, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17866-kamaiyah-how-does-it-feel/"">How Does It Feel</a>,"" is here, and it’s as wistful and sunny as it was when it came out last year. But now it’s joined by 15 other tracks that hit on the same energy: It feels good to be young, but it’s even better to be smart enough to appreciate how fleeting that feeling is.</p>
<p><i>Good Night in the Ghetto'</i>s production is the aural equivalent of watching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33158-too-hort/""> Too $hort</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29154-tlc/"">TLC</a> videos half-asleep through one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29386-hype-williams/"">Hype Williams</a>’ custom ’90s fish-eye lenses—a blur of reference points from across hip-hop's glitziest decade. Kamaiyah is 20, which means her earliest impressions of that decade’s music would have come around the time the industry was locked into a death spiral and rap was vanishing from the charts. Seen through this filter, it’s easy to see how a video like, say, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoQwdzKm7hk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ladies’ Night</a>"" would seem like the peak of some lost civilization. But while she carries a brick phone around as a prop for her throwback image, she otherwise she treats the whole back-in-the-day thing lightly, a personal quirk rather than a defining mission.</p>
<p>Besides, Bay Area rap has been celebrating the power of silky Anita Baker and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"">Sade</a> keyboard patches for years. These sounds have been recreated so lovingly for so long that they've become a thread snaking through a wide range of music. Kamaiyah is part of a tradition that extends back to early-‘90s hits like Conscious Daughters’ ""Something to Ride to (Fonky Expedition)"" (she <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9792-supa-dupa-fly-kamaiyah-bosses-up/"">told</a> Pitchfork that Conscious Daughter’s Karryl ""Special One"" Smith gave her the mixtape title) and continues today: the Trackademicks-produced ""Come Back"" could easily have been given to fellow East Bay artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28634-j-stalin/"">J. Stalin</a>, whose music often has the same plush retro-funk feel.</p>
<p>Kamaiyah stands out from her peers, though, with her appealingly natural presence. Her voice sounds as unaffected and assured singing as it does rapping, and she writes big hooks: The chorus to ""Swing My Way"" is full-bodied enough to picture a shirtless male guest star belting it, but she handles it herself, her small voice giving off its own heat. The little interjection ""woopty woopty woo"" on ""Out the Bottle"" is fearsomely catchy, ""I hope I don’t yelp this involuntarily in a roomful of strangers"" catchy. But it’s a detail, a grace note on an album that never oversells anything. Restraint is a slippery virtue to enthusiastically trumpet, but it usually marks the separation between an artist who can hold down a single and one who can comfortably occupy an album.</p>
<p>This poise is what makes Kamaiyah someone worth spending time with. There's a great song on here in the Too $hort tradition (""Niggas"") about loving sex, and severe disinterest in being obligated to have it with one person. But it’s not a sexual tall-tale meant to make Kamaiyah sound superhuman: ""Hit the back room come back, my dress undid/ He gon’ zip it back before they notice we be fucking,"" she sings playfully. On ""Freaky Freaks,"" she falls asleep in her Jeep because she’s too high to drive. This is: a) not something it’s easy to imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a> rapping about, and b) something an affable-everyman like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5186-devin-the-dude/"">Devin the Dude</a> has probably done in real life. Approachability is a cornerstone of Kamaiyah’s style.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there’s her good-life ode ""How Does It Feel."" Despite some stiff competition, it remains her best song, something she implicitly acknowledges by reprising it for the introductory track ""I’m On."" It sounds even better on <i>Good Night</i> without eclipsing anything around it. The emotions on the tape—joy, yearning—are never better expressed than in the two questions she poses in the chorus: ""How does it feel to be rich"" and ""How does it  feel to just live?"" The underlying subtext—that these might be two versions of the same question—is present, without insisting on itself. Just like everything else on <i>Good Night</i>, the essential substance is just <i>there</i>, a cocked eyebrow and a meaningful pause from someone who’s confident enough to put it all out there in her own way and allow you a minute to catch up.</p></div>"|21712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21712-a-good-night-in-the-ghetto/|8.2|Jayson Greene

In another world he might have been blessed with the gritty, commanding pipes of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3962-joe-strummer/"">Joe Strummer</a> or a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5361-against-me/"">Laura Jane Grace</a>, singers who by their very nature exude authority. Instead he shares a voice with the guy from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5052-matt-and-kim/"">Matt &amp; Kim</a>.<br/> <br/> At his best, Harris just owns it. 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9328-the-body-the-blood-the-machine/"">The Body, The Blood, The Machine</a> </i>is still the band's most-loved album, because it's the giddiest one, pairing the band's inherent fervor with slaphappy power-pop riffs that charged ahead like a classroom of kids running for the door after a recess bell. Since then, however, it's been diminishing returns as the band has attempted ever-soberer statements, often at the expense of the uncurbed enthusiasm that made that album such a treasure. They hit their nadir with 2013's buzz-killing <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17876-the-thermals-desperate-ground/"">Desperate Ground</a></i>, the closest they've come to a flat-out bad album, in part because of the good-on-paper decision to pair the band with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7052-john-agnello/"">John Agnello</a>. His stern, muddy mix sucked much of the joy out of its songs (though it's unclear how much they had to begin with). <br/> <br/> Thankfully that joy deficit isn't a problem on <i>We Disappear</i>, a reunion with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5613-chris-walla/"">Chris Walla</a>, which despite its fatalistic title and fixation on failing bodies and fading relationships plays up the fun factor in a way the last few records haven't. It wouldn't be right to call it a return to form, since this band never truly breaks form, but it's got higher highs than any Thermals album since <i>The Body, The Blood, The Machine</i>—and really, the best way to judge a Thermals album is by its highs. “My Heart Went Cold” is an early one, a double-glazed sticky bun of a rocker, all eager bass, “oh-woah-oh!” injections, and puppy-dog pep. A protest song that's as much a celebration of the form as it is an act of defiance, “Hey You” is chased by the equally determined “If We Don't Die Today,” one of the band's most ripping ballads. It's a hell of an opening stretch.<br/> <br/> As is usually the case, though, the band stumbles when they slow things down. “The Great Dying” lends the album its title with Harris's most vivid description yet of the vast nothing that lies in store for us all: “The sky will turn to fire, the sea will turn to salt / Our memories will burn like we were never here at all / We disappear.” But the song's dreary pace makes it a slog, and the forced bleakness isn't a great fit for Walla, whose specialty is crisp indie-pop, not cacophonous forays into existential dread. <br/> <br/> Most people don't come to Thermals albums for that stuff. They come for the shout-alongs and fist pumps, and even in its somewhat-dialed-down second half <i>We Disappear</i> smuggles in generous dollops of both, with tunes like “In Every Way,” which throws down the record's tersest, most blown-out riff, and the endearing power-pop quickie “Thinking Of You.” After two albums that struggled with the growing divide between the serious band they seemingly longed to be and the bubblegum punk band listeners want them to be, The Thermals strike the right balance on <i>We Disappear</i>, an album that manages to satisfy both camps.</p></div>"|21759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21759-we-disappear/|6.9|Evan Rytlewski

His note on its follow-up, <i>I'm a Piece of Shit</i>, is similarly candid, but this is the morning after way too many morning afters and he's full of regrets: ""The melancholy result to all my fucked-up decisions.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Molly tracers are still visible on ""Up Still,"" but the party is definitely over. ""Everything dies, everything's a lie,"" he sighs. Only a hater or a sociopath doesn't feel a tweak in his chest when somebody else plops his heart on the table, and the fact that the <a href=""http://awfulrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Awful Records</a> patriarch is not only fully shouldering the blame for the shambles his love life is in, but also shrinking back into self-doubt, elicits even more empathy. That the album is almost chock-full of bangers lends credence to the theory that you create your best art when you're emotionally wrecked.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Accepting responsibility for his actions aside,<i> I'm a Piece of Shit</i> is generally a more mature record than<i> Who's Gonna Get Fucked First</i>. <i>Who's Gonna Get …</i> is druggy and dripping with sex, but the sex is consensual and the attitudes progressive, with Father and friends eschewing tired old slut-shaming in favor of sexual liberty and justice for all. ""You call her ass a ho? Please let a player know why you’re such a square, bro,"" Richposlim asks on ""BET Uncut.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>I'm a Piece of Shit</i> continues that narrative, but it's ""mature"" in a more literal way. Even though Father's only in his mid-twenties, he seems to crave the sort of relationship someone a decade older does. And why not? Fame ages you. ""I'm tired of looking for love as much as I'm tired of looking for drugs … Been grew tired of all these bitches on my dick like broomsticks,"" he says on album opener ""Why Don't U."" This is the kind of record made when the thrill of having a Baskin-Robbins variety of women waiting after every show has dulled and monogamy seems so much sweeter. There's lots of talk about staying the night and wanting a ""bitch to come hold me.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In fact, Father's sexual appetites increasingly are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>-like (as are some of his sounds: the drums on ""Spit or Swallow"" sound a lot like the Linn LM-1 Drum pattern on ""Raspberry Beret""). Both artists are insatiable, and Father, just like the Purple One, knows that real freakery is about diving into the deep end physically and emotionally—and you can only wade so far with a one-night stand. As the production on  ""Slow Dance 2 [Interlude]"" morphs from twinkly to trippy Father murmurs ""Until the brink just to see how close it brings us,"" and it's a disarmingly intimate moment.</p>
<p>On ""Party On Me,"" the tables have turned. ""When I'm not around, do you even long for me?"" Father asks, wistful. It's one of the album's standout tracks, thanks to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"">iLoveMakonnen</a>'s pleading chorus and a longing beat, and the juxtaposition of nursery-rhyme singsong cadences, a tinkly marimba and such despairing, vulnerable lyrics deepen the ache. ""Startin' to think these bitches slept with me just for amusement … I wanna die a little, cry a little, get a little high right now,"" he raps in ""Y U Make It Hurt Like This."" His nakedness on<i> I'm a Piece of Shit</i> is more shocking than any stripper orgy at the Sheraton, mostly because it refutes the carefree, no-strings-attached clichés that litter rap<span>—</span>after awhile, crew love just ain't no fun.</p></div>"|21664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21664-im-a-piece-of-shit/|7.7|Rebecca Haithcoat

In the last few months, however, her fortunes took an abrupt turn: She signed to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"">Jack White</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=third%20man"">Third Man Records</a>, debuted on ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeoQtVKtaaw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colbert</a>,"" and released a string of hard-drinkin', hard-livin' singles. Even before she releases her debut, <i>Midwest Farmer's Daughter</i>, she has found herself at the center of some of the most intense buzz in country music, which means she has undergone a great deal of scrutiny. Most of it has concentrated on her backstory, which sounds like every country song rolled into one: Dad lost the farm, Nashville screwed her over, she shacked up with a married man, did a brief stint in jail, lost a child. To record this album, she hocked her wedding ring and car to pay for sessions at Memphis' legendary Sun Studios.</p>
<p>She owns up to all of it on her debut's epic six-minute opener ""Hands of Time,"" which tells her own story better than any critic, press release, publicist, TV host, or awards presenter ever could. It's a remarkable cold open, an incredible introduction to an artist who is both a newcomer and a veteran, but what makes it so powerful is the contrast between all the bad shit she's endured and her modest goals for recovery: ""All I wanna do is make a little cash."" Rather than conquer the world or see her name up in lights, Price just wants get the farm back for her dad and buy her mom a nice bottle of wine.</p>
<p>On <i>Midwest Farmer's Daughter</i>—whose title is clearly meant to echo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2586-loretta-lynn/"">Loretta Lynn</a>'s famous <a href=""https://youtu.be/pM84OekHtAQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">origin story</a>—Price emerges as a woman struggling to reclaim her story from the Nashville machine and reset it in old-school honky-tonk tunes that split the difference between so many ampersands: country &amp; western, rock &amp; roll, rhythm &amp; blues. It's an ambitious piece of music-making and storytelling, featuring a road-hardened backing band called the Price Tags and a singer whose flinty voice conveys both a guarded vulnerability and a reckless scrappiness. She fiddles while Nashville burns on ""This Town Gets Around,"" three minutes of inside baseball that details all the unscrupulous managers and sexist promoters who populate the industry like fleas on a hound. ""I guess it's me who gets the joke,"" she sings. ""Maybe I'd be smarter if I played dumb.""</p>
<p>On most of <i>Daughter</i>, however, Price is tough in conventional ways, on songs that fit a bit more squarely with country traditions. She threatens a bar patron on the honky-tonk fight song ""About to Find Out,"" drowns the devil on her shoulder with whisky and tequila on ""Since You Put Me Down,"" welcomes a wayward lover on ""How the Mighty Have Fallen."" They're sturdy tunes, strong examples of the country songwriting, but they don't hit with the same force as the more obviously personal songs here. <i>Daughter</i> is best when it's specifically first-person, when Price bends country to fit her own story rather than bend herself to fit the form. You root hard for Price to win these battles, even as you may find yourself wishing <i>Midwest Farmer's Daughter</i> could transcend the hype.</p></div>"|21745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21745-midwest-farmers-daughter/|7.0|Stephen M.

Berlin twosome <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33520-amnesia-scanner/"">Amnesia Scanner</a> arrive in front of us with a terse press release, full of mystery. They are self-described ""Xperienz Designers,"" but they refuse to give any ""xplanations"" for what that means. Instead, they provide the curious schmuck who’s opened their PR email with six unnamed hyperlinks.

<p dir=""ltr"">Amnesia Scanner's <a href=""http://www.amnesiascanner.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, too, is a cacophonous visual medley. Their Twitter and Facebook pages don’t offer much. We know they are affiliated with Berlin’s <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/janusberlin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Janus</a> collective (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32666-lotic/"">Lotic</a>, M.E.S.H., Kablam).

So there it is, a skeleton of biography. Was the journey worth it? The music would have to be surpassingly vivid to stand out from its surrounding rhetoric. Luckly, the gumshoe Google chase matches the music, which feels like a puzzle that might kill you once you’ve solved it. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">By the numbers, <i>AS</i> is misleadingly brief. The six tracks total to a slim 21 minutes, but as a whole the album feels much longer that that. Each of the songs is prefaced by ""AS"" (""AS Wood Gas,"" for example), which either signifies a contraction of the band’s name or one half of an unfinished metaphor. Titles like ""AS Atlas"" or ""AS Chingy"" just add another level of interpretative chaos. They beg the question of whether or not the song is supposed to embody the object it references. More likely than not, it’s another trap door. Is it possible that they sample late '90s pop-rap superstar Chingy in ""AS Chingy""? That might have to be a mystery for another day.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Describing the music of <i>AS</i> is similarly difficult. ""Electronic"" only suffices if you paint with the widest brush. Sure, the music here was most likely made on a computer, but at its core it is deeply organic. You may never hear a pre-made synth on <i>AS.</i> You are more likely to hear your gurgling stomach or something tumbling down a flight of stairs. These tracks are overflowing, sloshing full of content, and impossibly dense. They can suddenly and brutally evaporate the comforts of time’s steady flow by queering what you think three or four minutes is supposed to feel like.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If there is a steady descriptor for <i>AS</i>, it's ""unmooring."" There's no way to know where they sourced a particular beat, chord, or vocal. This leaves a lot to imagination. The sounds of <i>AS</i> are primordial and alienatingly futuristic, recalling all the worst parts of the uncanny valley. If we can begin to imagine what a cyborg’s chaotic inner id might be like, you have to to listen to <i>AS</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Intense as <i>AS</i> may be, it never becomes a slog or overly complex. The EP has an acute grasp on the rhythms and mood that make people dance. Even at its most mordant, <i>AS</i> somehow remains accessible and exciting, and prompts discovery by tricking you into dancing along to the strangest sonic triggers. It is a testament to the skill and inventiveness of these producers that they can make tracks like ""AS Chingy"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17984-amnesia-scanner-as-crust/"">AS Crust</a>"" into implausible bangers. Both are nauseating, vertigo-inducing tracks, stitched together from pleading processed vocals, defiantly herky-jerky percussions, and cold greasy synths. It makes Amnesia Scanner utterly confounding. Even with biographical information in hand, several music videos, and art projects, you can't put your finger on Amnesia Scanner for one second. Music this uncomfortable is rarely so euphoric.</p></div>"|21737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21737-as-ep/|8.2|Kevin Lozano

As an early member of a Chicago collective, the Association for the Advancement of <span>Creative Musicians</span> (or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/698-the-aacm-collective-turns-50-with-its-radical-creativity-intact/"">AACM</a>), the trumpeter worked in a trio that included saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11316-anthony-braxton/"">Anthony Braxton</a> and violinist Leroy Jenkins—a group documented on the landmark 1968 release <i>3 Compositions of New Jazz</i>.</p>
<p>On that album and other recordings from the period, Smith’s performance aesthetic signaled the arrival of a confident and original voice. He could craft mournful melodic lines that suggested the folk music of his Mississippi Delta youth, before quickly steering into rough-sounding yet controlled smears of notes. Then, in the midst of an improvisation, he would allow stretches of silence to enter his phrasing. In contrast to New York’s consistently in-the-red style of free-jazz, Smith and other AACM figures also experimented with world music instrumentation and modernist chamber composition in between passages of fiery blast.</p>
<p>In this scene, there was nothing strange about being a blues musician, a composer of classical music, and a free-improviser with a recognizable attack. And this example has proved a durable influence on younger jazz innovators like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2132-vijay-iyer/"">Vijay Iyer</a>, a pianist who spent time in Smith’s early-21st century quartet (before his own career as a bandleader <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16483-accelerando/"">took off</a>). In interviews, Iyer is often eager to <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/vijay-iyer-humanities-festival-mutations-radhe-interview-darlene-patti/Content?oid=15354458"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">credit the AACM</a> as an inspiration behind his own mobility as a composer and soloist.</p>
<p>Since signing to ECM, the storied jazz-and-classical label, Iyer has continued to vary his creative practice. The album <i>Mutations</i> found him composing for a string quartet, while <i>Break Stuff</i>—the most recent set from Iyer’s celebrated jazz <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28455-vijay-iyer-trio/"">trio</a>—included an acoustic tribute to Detroit techno innovator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5751-robert-hood/"">Robert Hood</a>. On <i>A Cosmic Rhythm With Each Stroke</i>, Iyer reconnects with Smith in a studio for the first time since appearing as a sideman on the trumpeter’s 2009 album <i>Spiritual Dimensions</i>. Their meeting here results in a frequently gorgeous, sometimes roiling set that stands out in each artist’s catalog.</p>
<p>The opener, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18090-vijay-iyer-wadada-leo-smith-passage/"">Passage</a>,” was composed by Iyer, and works well as a platform for Smith’s range of instrumental techniques—with wisps of balladry leading to harsh and piercing moments. Some of Smith’s more surprising exclamations may initially seem like unmusical provocations, just before he wrings a demonstration of magic from his trumpet—as when he keeps a seemingly unstable drone alive for seconds, or when he creates a winning melody from an unlikely opening intonation. Iyer’s performance on piano lends dramatic shape to the track, though he’s just getting started.</p>
<p>The set’s centerpiece is a seven-part suite that also provides the album’s title. Inspired by the Indian artist <a href=""http://talwargallery.com/nasreen-bio/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nasreen Mohamedi</a>—her drawing graces the cover—this nearly hour-long stretch of music often finds Iyer switching seamlessly between acoustic piano and an electronic setup. “All Becomes Alive” begins with simmering traces of digital sound behind Smith’s high-register, incantatory playing. Near the track’s conclusion, Smith contributes tart, pointillistic figures as Iyer uses a laptop to produce a bass-heavy pulse (while keeping both hands on his piano). In the middle section, Smith responds to Iyer’s flowing, legato progressions with a mellow soulfulness.</p>
<p>The players occasionally push each other into less familiar zones. The first three minutes of “A Cold Fire” reveals Iyer playing more “out” than on his past ECM recordings, while on “Labyrinths,” his joint interest in Indian classical composition and American minimalism guides Smith into fixed-tempo riffing of a kind that is unusual in the trumpeter’s catalog. And when Iyer switches to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16952-fender-rhodes/"">Fender Rhodes</a> for “Notes on Water,” the musicians mine the mood of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14623-bitches-brew-legacy-edition/""><i>Bitches Brew</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a>, while still sounding like themselves.</p>
<p>In conceiving such far-ranging explorations of texture, the risk for musicians is that the end result might wind up seeming like a catalog of possible approaches—a look-book to be skipped through by sound designers searching for film-music cues. But the rapport between Iyer and Smith ensures that this music always feels compositionally sure-footed, even when parts of the suite are being discovered as they play.  No matter its track-to-track variance, <i>Cosmic</i> always sounds harmonious as an album-length statement. In doing this, it also recalls Smith’s early-career desire to integrate “all forms of music,” as stated in a 1969 interview with the French magazine <i>Jazz Hot</i>.</p>
<p>Appropriately, the closing track here is a Smith composition titled “Marian Anderson”—a dedication to the African-American contralto who broke the color barrier at the Metropolitan Opera in 1955. After the meditative theme, Smith’s conjuring of a historic opera singer’s legacy seemingly gives him license to reveal some of his most songful, pure-tone playing. “Everything and anything is valuable,” Smith told the European magazine in 1969, as the first wave of AACM players was capturing the imagination of audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. More than four decades later, Smith is still demonstrating the wisdom of this approach—reaching back into American art-music history for inspiration while keeping himself open to the new sounds being proposed by the next generation.</p></div>"|21518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21518-a-cosmic-rhythm-with-each-stroke/|8.5|Seth Colter Walls

The<i> Vroom Vroom</i> EP is her latest experiment: Produced entirely by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20542-pc-music-volume-1/"">PC Music</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31081-sophie/"">Sophie</a>, it finds Charli in her trademark middle-finger-flipped repose. But here, the 23-year-old Brit veers away from the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABhDiXbUaBE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">marketable</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxxajLWwzqY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rebellion</a> that underpins her poppier work: <i>Vroom Vroom</i> is pointedly uncommercial and abrasive. The title track  sounds like a rickety clown car whose horn toots <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"">Missy</a>'s ""The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)""—a blocky, disjointed paean to fast rides and good times. ""Boom boom boom/ Hear me coming through the radio,"" she speak-sings with affected enunciation, referencing her hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOPMlIIg_38"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song</a> from <i>The Fault in Our Stars </i>soundtrack. ""Watch me go zoom zoom zoom/ Try to catch me but you're too slow.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The lyrics to<i> Vroom Vroom</i> deal with being young, free, hedonistic, and ambitious in ferociously trite terms, and to a tinny soundtrack. ""Cute, sexy, and my ride's sporty,"" Charli sing-songs on ""Vroom Vroom."" ""Dance while we're young on top of the mountain,"" she trills on ""Paradise,"" a Eurotrance duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32263-hannah-diamond/"">Hannah Diamond</a>, one of PC Music's leading faces. Is she sending up pop’s shallow triumphalism? Or reinforcing it? As Charli sees it, audiences are smart enough to detect the artistic intent at the heart of this collaboration—to ""be sharp, potent [and] deadly,""  as she said in a statement, and be ""number one,"" as ""Trophy"" puts it. But few things are as wearying as pop culture that constantly congratulates you on how clever you are for ""getting it,"" and <i>Vroom Vroom</i> is nothing if not exhausting. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17801-various-artists-spring-breakers-ost/"">Spring Breakers</a> is a good litmus test here: If you were a fan of Harmony Korine's 2012 exploitation flick, you'll probably love the intentional shallowness and plasticky transgression of<i> Vroom Vroom</i>. If (like me) you would have walked out had you not spent $18 on a ticket, you'll probably hate it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Charli and Sophie <i>do</i> push each other here, though only one of them really benefits: Paired with an actual songwriter, <i>Vroom Vroom</i> is the closest Sophie's ever come to making viable pop songs. ""Paradise"" at least feels complete, a trance ballad indebted to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mg7ok8dmDU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">East 17</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NPBIwQyPWE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Avril Lavigne</a> that continually peaks without offering much of a payoff, other than a horrible processed baby-voice refrain, and some brief, lovely harmonies between Charli and Hannah Diamond. Hooked around a sample from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSLMN6g_Od4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pulp Fiction</a>, ""Trophy"" pits Charli’s confrontational rap (""bitch I’m here to fuck you up"") against a glitchy dancehall beat reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"">Major Lazer</a>. It’s relentless and dispiriting, too shallow to pass as sincere, too obvious to work as satire—if that is the intention, then it comes off closer to a cheap <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10976-weird-al-yankovic/"">""Weird Al"" Yankovich</a> pop rip than, say, the KLF or ZTT Records’ early output.</p>
<p>At times, <i>Vroom Vroom</i> recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6916-britney-spears/"">Britney Spears</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/poptimist/6734-poptimist-10/"">Blackout</a></i>, made in the wake of Spears’ public breakdown. Spears was always assumed to have little agency in her own work, and on that record she toyed brilliantly with ideas of autonomy and unwholesomeness, using sharp lyrics and sharper production to play with the idea of disintegrating identity. These same ideas<a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/12/31/feminine-appropriation-2014-electronic-music-trend"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> underpin the PC Music project</a>, and you can hear them at work on <i>Vroom Vroom</i>EP. But no one is being done any favors reducing Charli XCX to a vapid cypher, particularly as it drains her vivid personality from the work. <span class=""message_body"">The EP bottoms out on the final track ""Secret (Shh),” a grime-indebted ooze where she does a generic good-girl-gone-bad routine that yanks all the joy out of misbehaving. </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20066-sucker/"">Sucker</a></i> was thrilling because it felt like pop with a death wish, its creator giving her all in the name of sheer recklessness and pure kicks.<i> Vroom Vroom</i> just sounds dead behind the eyes.</p></div>"|21683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21683-vroom-vroom-ep/|4.5|Laura Snapes

Young artist creates track; track becomes hit; hit becomes phenomenon, artist becomes famous. The track is undeniable and thus, ubiquitous. Your parents are aware of it. Fans start to hate it, though nowhere close to as much as the artist does. And then, when the artist goes ahead and decides to make new music, everything he does, from the promotion to the concerts, looks like a Sisyphean attempt to escape its shadow.</p>
<p>The Brooklyn producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30453-baauer/"">Baauer</a> is observing the rites. He has called his Billboard-topping, YouTube-dominating 2013 craze ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13635-baauer-harlem-shake/"">Harlem Shake</a>"" <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/baauer-is-shaking-off-the-blessing-and-curse-of-meme-stardom-20160217?page=2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""corny and annoying as fuck""</a> and his new album <i>Aa</i> represents his ""defiant"" new beginning. For Baauer, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that he had less to do with his own song's rise than strangers on the Internet. They were the ones who performed the alchemy that changed it from a jam, to <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/rustie/essential-mix-bbc-radio-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an Essential Mix standout</a> to a viral soundtrack. ""I birthed it, it was raised by others, and now it's like my weird, fucked-up adopted teenage kid coming back to me,"" he <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/17/meet-baauer-the-man-behind-the-harlem-shake.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said at the time.</a></p>
<p>Sometimes, talented career artists become one-hit wonders (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen/"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>) and sometimes, clowns who have stumbled upon, or stolen, something infectious do the same (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27637-vanilla-ice/"">Vanilla Ice</a>.) The experience can be particularly difficult for an artist like Baauer, a raw, young musician with interesting ideas who has yet to fully develop. Following ""Harlem Shake,"" <i>Aa </i>might feel to some like an undercooked, scattershot album, experimental to its own detriment. But if Baauer were an unknown musician —which, artistically speaking, he still essentially <i>is </i>— it'd be a rimshot of a debut, crackling with energy and humor, well-paced, with no dud tracks and more than a few infectious ones.</p>
<p><i>Aa </i>is devoted to the block-party spirit of hip-hop, in keeping with most of Baauer's work, and at a time when various genres of <a href=""http://www.fuse.tv/2016/03/tropical-house-dancehall-music-essay"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">electronic music are downplaying the black sources</a> of their sound, it's refreshingly willing to share both its influences and the limelight. Many of the tracks in its adrenaline-spiked back half are dominated by other artists, as Baauer took advantage of the connections afforded him by ""Harlem Shake"" to collaborate with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/64193-baauer-mia-and-g-dragon-team-for-temple-listen/"">M.I.A.</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/63722-baauer-future-and-pusha-t-team-for-kung-fu/"">Pusha T, Future</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a>. Their appearances aren't wasted. Features<i> </i>function like power-ups on <i>Aa</i>, allowing the album to ascend in excitement, leveling up to an almighty peak. (Baauer's clear love of collaboration and respect for the sounds he incorporates might also serve as a balm to those who were irritated by the way that the mainstream ""Harlem Shake"" dance craze completely ignored<a href=""http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2013/02/the_harlem_shake_viral_video_craze_what_about_the_original.html?wpisrc=root_more_news"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> the original, Cam'ron-approved dance.</a>)</p>
<p>The album's melting pot feel is consistent with that of Baauer's less-famous releases, the EPs <i>Dum Dum </i>(2012)<i> </i>and <i>ß </i>(2014)<i>. </i>His methodology is consistent: He excavates the undergirdings of genres like hip-hop, R&amp;B and dancehall, and swaps in a new foundation, often composed of wobbling, thundering bass. After a couple of exploratory warning shots at the outset of <i>Aa</i> — the Rustie-inspired opener, ""Church,"" the drum n' bass n' trap banger ""GoGo!"" — the album settles into a groove on the explosive R&amp;B of ""Body,"" its first inescapable track, which splits the difference between the producer's past work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"">AlunaGeorge</a> and the soiled romanticism of electronic artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31042-giraffage/"">Giraffage</a>.</p>
<p>From there, it's a steady climb with stops along the way in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2134-discovery/""><i>Discovery</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a> soundalike (""Pinku"") and peace councils between back-alley grime and Bonecrusher-style mob music. (""Day Ones."") On songs like these, Baauer demonstrates his ability to identify and recontextualize bite-size melodic candy, and ""Harlem Shake's"" rise starts to look less like an Internet accident and more like inevitability. Check out the way he plays the Tetris theme song into the back end of ""Sow."" It's a goofy, addictive gimmick that loses none of its melodic power for being so.</p>
<p>In the tradition of many of the best electronic releases of the decade, <i>Aa</i> is a collage. But its patchwork of influences isn't a way for the producer to avoid pressure. Instead, Baauer and the other artists meet the heavyweight expectations head-on. ""Temple,"" the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"">M.I.A.</a> feature here, is vintage Mathangi: She sounds as fresh and London-cocky as she did on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5618-arular/"">Arular</a>. </i>And ""Kung Fu"" doesn't dare to waste <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"">Pusha T</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>. Pusha and Future have two of the most iconic voices in contemporary hip-hop, and Baauer clearly understands the appeal of placing them as foils on the same track, the brick-hard snarl and the ecstatic lament.</p>
<p>If you want a file to show up at the top of an alphabetically-organized folder, you can throw a bunch of A's at the front of its name, and ensure that it will be there. But as much as Baauer may want <i>Aa </i>to define a new beginning, to crowd out everything else he's done so far, there's no easy way for him to erase ""Harlem Shake."" He's doomed to be evaluated in the context of what will likely represent the peak of a certain kind of career success. The best he can do is what he's done here: rectify the wrongs of the craze that the track spawned while building on what it did right. Take advantage of the opportunities it's granted, throw an album-length party and encourage the dancers to come correct.</p></div>"|21738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21738-aa/|7.3|Jonah Bromwich

The results have been some of the most vulnerable and transformative street-rap in years, and <i>Thug Talk</i> continues down that path. ""We say sister be cool, even when it ain’t cool / Tell our nephews to chill, but they wan' live just like you"" Boosie ruminates, reflecting on the dichotomy of living wrong while striving to be an example of stability and morality for those around you.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Thug Talk</i> works almost as a concept record in which Boosie, like a peer rather than a judge, relates to the rush of gangsta life while trying to warn against it. ""Wake Up"" puts a fine point on it by sampling the late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9055-pimp-c/"">Pimp C</a>, Boosie's mentor, from his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjbO04IqzEw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most famous radio interview</a>, in which he urged rappers to ""talk about the bad side of the drug game too."" Boosie snarls with the urgency of a teacher in an inner-city school drama: ""You distributed well, hung with all the stars/Now they done took ya crib, repoed all ya cars / Sentenced all ya boys, locked ya momma up/ Now you gon turn rat or leave ya mama stuck."" His preaching is effective because it’s rooted less in righteousness than the simple need for survival.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Yet Boosie still zeros in on the aspects that are too attractive for even him to still deny about that sordid lifestyle. On songs like ""Off The Chain"" he raps about violent altercation with the fearlessness and braggadocio of his younger, more reckless self.  The unfortunately titled ""Retarded,"" meanwhile, harkens back to the old, looser ""ratchet"" party records that put him on a larger platform.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The real highlights come from the pulsating, thumping ""For da Love of Money"", about the perils that money and shine bring, and the sobering, meditative ""Right Game Wrong N***a"" about the ways in which the people around you will double-cross and take advantage. Meanwhile, the elegant ode to his children ""Found Love n U"" captures a father’s love and dedication with complete earnesty, and it’s a testament to Boosie’s artistic range that he can go from vicious and cold to extremely tender and loving with relative ease and no sense that he should hide any of his feelings.</p>
<p><i>Thug Talk</i> might not have the emotional weight of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21424-in-my-feelings-going-thru-it/"">In My Feelings</a>,</i> and it doesbn't outshine the ferocity and incredible production of<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21598-out-my-feelings-in-my-past/""> Out My Feelings</a>, </i>but it pulls its weight against both records by continuing Boosie’s incredible 2016 streak. On the intro, he promises us that by the end of the album, ""you will understand thug talk,"" and his innate gift as a teacher and a philosopher on record all but guarantees that to be the case.</p></div>"|21773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21773-thug-talk/|7.3|Israel Daramola

He carries himself with the air of someone who's studiously thumbed through his parents' record collection. He cites <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"">Sade</a> as primary influences, and his stage name references P-Funk mythology. That said, Cook also has a foot planted firmly in the current moment. His resumé as a touring guitarist reads like a who's who of forward-thinking R&amp;B and electro-pop: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"">Solange</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32338-devonte-hynes/"">Dev Hynes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"">Chairlift</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28205-kindness/"">Kindness</a>. He's equal parts laptop producer and pop classicist, a singer who sits comfortably among the mostly electronic roster of Ghostly International.</p>
<p>On his debut EP, <i>Crucial</i>, Cook (a former Pitchfork intern) traffics in woozy R&amp;B numbers built atop dense, keyboard-driven instrumentals. Take ""Relax,"" which opens with the surface noise of a dusty record that gives way to squelchy synths, a steady click-clack beat and Cook's layered vocals, pleading ""I wanna get to where you are/ Where you are."" ""Slammin' Mannequin"" throws a handful of '80s cultural touchstones in a blender—a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1852-grandmaster-flash/"">Grandmaster Flash</a>-esque beat, the romantic comedy <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093493/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mannequin</i></a>, a guitar solo and compact synth chords that recall Prince—and hits purée. It's one of <i>Crucial</i>'s most successful songs, even if its chorus lands with a disempowering thud (""You can be my slammin' mannequin/ Rock the greatest fashions and let it in/ Who's to say that you're not falling in love with me?"").</p>
<p>Speaking of Prince, the Purple One looms large over many of the EP's songs—hardly surprising, given that <i>Crucial</i> borrows its title from a bootleg of studio outtakes that's been apocryphally credited to Prince and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a>. ""New Romantic"" is built around a funk-indebted, rubbery bassline; its climax finds Cook cooing over a weepy guitar solo. On ""Love Interlude,"" he backs up his vocals with a soaring falsetto, singing, ""You can't stop lovers like us/Run from daybreak to dusk."" ""Woman's Dress"" asks some very Princely questions (""Will I ever be enough for you?"") but delivers them with the sort of muted sorrow that's become <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>'s calling card.</p>
<p><i>Crucial</i> is remarkably dense for a self-recorded album, though it has a tactile, analog feel that belies its origins as laptop music. While the musicianship on display is impressive, Cook's songwriting could certainly be sharper. None of these songs have strong enough hooks to encourage repeat listening or stand out from the rest of the EP. As a personality, Cook also tends to get lost in all that texture. His vocals sit fairly low in the mix, and his words often get swallowed up by the backing tracks. His stage name and cover art hint at a compelling narrative—one imagines a sort of retro-afro-futurist <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074851/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Man Who Fell to Earth</i></a>—but Starchild never really emerges as a character on <i>Crucial</i>, beyond a mouthpiece for mundane pop tropes. Bryndon Cook shows a lot of potential in synthesizing the sounds of his idols, but even so, <i>Crucial</i> remains a largely earthbound affair.</p></div>"|21615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21615-crucial-ep/|5.9|Mehan Jayasuriya

It’s been fewer than two calendar years since ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17041-ilovemakonnen-club-goin-up-on-a-tuesday-ft-drake/"">Tuesday</a>,"" but the once-ubiquitous summer 2014 jam feels positively ancient in a world full of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/33587-lil-yachty/"">Lil Yachtys</a>, Lil Uzi Verts, and Kodak Blacks. Particularly troubling is the shuffling pace of iLoveMakonnen’s output since then—following up his solid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19774-ilovemakonnen-ilovemakonnen-ep/"">eponymous debut EP</a> with a mixtape, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20473-drink-more-water-5/""><i>Drink More Water 5</i></a>, that, while slight, was just enough to float interested parties. (It helped that it was free.) November’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21292-ilovemakonnen-2/""><i>iLoveMakonnen2</i></a> was good, but it wasn’t hard to squint and wonder if the appeal was fading just a tad.</p>
<p>This is a standard dilemma for an artist like Makonnen at this crossroads, but he exacerbates the problem by frequently flipping between wildly different personalities—brash trap-rapper, which feels a little hollow; emotional rap singer, which suits him better; and an off-key pop artist, which might actually be his best mode (""Tuesday"" was neither rap or R&amp;B, after all, but essentially a pop song).</p>
<p>He refined the balance of all of these elements on <i>Drink More Water 5</i>, but it seemed unlikely to connect with anyone not already into what he’s doing. The sixth installment straddles a frustrating line between straight-up mixtape (which would temper fan expectations, somewhat) and an official album (because it is for sale on iTunes). Like everything else he's done since 2014, it feels inherently insecure, the movement of someone unsure how to keep pushing forward. All of the Makonnen sounds are here, but they are a little thinner, and more grating.</p>
<p>Constant experimentation doesn’t mean an artist is getting better, and consistency is not a crime. But the trap-rap songs have grown tiring, and the songs of that stripe here, like ""Big Gucci"" and ""Sellin,"" are more chores than bangers. When Makonnen decides to stretch and aim for an alchemy of pop songwriting and emotive singing, he’s still more than capable of producing something that can be direct and moving. The best song here is the one that nails this dynamic the sharpest, the Sonny Digital-produced ""Want You,"" which rides a beat not entirely unlike ""Tuesday"" for a good two-and-a-half minutes. (Speaking of biting yourself, ""Uwonteva"" is nothing more than a way-worse retread of the fun ""Trust Me Danny."")</p>
<p>The mild psych touches on the ballad ""Turn Off the Lies"" (geez that title) punch up the track, but it can’t help but feel a little staid, a too-late seasoning on a dry piece of meat already turning rubbery. At 11 tracks, it's longer than <i>2</i> and lacks the experimentation of <i>Drink More Water 5</i>, and it drags. The tape just kinda ends, with no resolution. And that damning lack of resolution is something that's haunted Makonnen for these two long years—sure he can put together memorable hooks and a sometimes head-turning lyric (""I take you to the movie and I treat you like a groupie—and you don’t mind""), but it's starting to feel one-dimensional.</p></div>"|21707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21707-drink-more-water-6/|6.2|Matthew Ramirez

The Welsh trio's bravura 2011 full-length debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15160-the-big-roar/""><i>The Big Roar</i></a> recreated the moment when underground rock crashed the mainstream with a sonic boom. It contains the band's only significant radio hit, ""Whirring,"" and it probably could have spawned two of three more of them if it hadn't arrived at a time when the public's appetite for herculean guitar rock was at an all-time low. 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17550-wolfs-law/""><i>Wolf's Law</i></a> was the group's sprawling ""let's put our major label budget to use"" record, the work of a band spreading their wings <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17389-mellon-collie-and-the-infinite-sadness/"">Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</a>-</i>style, attempting even bigger, proggier sounds and hiring a string section just because they could. It was spottier than their debut, but no less exciting, if only because it teased the new directions that might come next. <br/> <br/> Unfortunately, that makes their third album the disappointing realization that nothing new comes next. <i>Hitch</i> isn't just a retread of the band's previous work; it's a summation of all the ways the Alternative Nation has under-delivered since the new millennium. It's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/952-billy-corgan/"">Billy Corgan</a> throwing everything he has into a new album and coming up with the merely good-enough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16742-oceania/""><i>Oceania</i></a>. It's the gradual realization that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=dave+grohl"">Dave Grohl</a> had always been more into classic rock than he was punk. It's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32182-the-toadies/"">the Toadies</a> securing a prime spot at Lollapalooza because they were the only reunited act of their era playing that year.</p>
<p>It might not be a shock to see Joy Formidable eventually fall into the same pattern of diminishing returns as their predecessors, but it still stings, because they've been one of the genre's brightest young exports. Their magnificently loud yet melodically supple vision of big-tent rock has filled a void, and on their earlier albums their blustery sound paired fabulously with singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan's relatable songwriting. Her gargantuan riffs could make lyrics about routine personal experiences—miscommunications, slights, and romantic letdowns—sound like they were of enormous cosmic importance. And although it's never defined their image, the group also has a righteous feminist streak. Many of Bryan's songs capture the frustration of being talked over; their sheer volume served as a kind of pushback to every man who presumed to know what she's trying to say without having the consideration to actually listen to what she was saying. Alternative could use more bands like this.</p>
<p>But <i>Hitch</i> finds them in a holding pattern. ""Radio Of Lips"" is a virtual rewrite of the <i>Wolf's Law</i> lead single ""This Ladder Is Ours,"" right down to its propulsive tempo and fluttery, caffeinated-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a> guitar riff. It could be a knock-out song, if it didn't linger for a full six and a half minutes. ""The Last Thing On My Mind"" dabbles in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Zeppelin</a>-y blues, but similarly outstays its welcome. Bryan's guitars have always been the band's selling point, but in such prolonged exposures they become downright numbing. The band self-recorded the album over 12 months in a self-built studio in their remote hometown Mold. They clearly spent a lot of time cooped up with these songs, and it's as if they want they listener to feel cooped up with them, too.<br/> <br/> <i>Wolf's Law</i> had the proggy ambitions to justify its bloat, but <i>Hitch</i>'s songs take much longer to do far less. Unsurprisingly, then, one of its highlights is one of its shortest. The song that most directly addresses Bryan's break-up from bassist Rhydian Dafydd—a break-up that could have easily ended a different band—""Fog (Black Windows)"" has the tight focus and light bounce of<i> </i>one of <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19282-pixies-catalogue/""><i>Bossanova</i></a>'s torch songs. ""These sheets are haunted / Not by you, but by a moment that's long gone,"" Bryan sings. And though she worries that ""a love like you will never come again,"" she grasps at a silver lining: ""Maybe we're not alone after all."" It's a sweet moment, a woman grieving a cherished relationship, while the very ex she's singing about coos supportively in the background. Everything that comes after it feels mechanical by comparison.<br/> <br/> It's hard hearing a band with this much raw talent pour so much into an album that rarely gets off the ground. At times it almost sounds as if they know they've taken their current sound as far as it can go and seem palpably frustrated they can't figure out their next move. Near the end of the record—well into its 67-minute runtime—there's a song called ""Blowing Fire"" where Bryan vents about ""blowing fire for too long and getting nothing,"" and the line sums up the band's newfound stagnancy so aptly it's as if they're daring critics not to throw it back at them. Fire still comes easy to the Joy Formidable, but <i>Hitch</i> is the first time they've seemed at a loss for how to use it.</p></div>"|21550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21550-hitch/|6.1|Evan Rytlewski

Though the group released one album before <i>Good Grief—</i>2013’s <i>Wildewoman—</i>this sophomore collection feels like one of those debuts that arrive preternaturally fully-formed, with songs as polished as the quintet's outfits. Singer-songwriters Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig, who met while studying at the Berklee College of Music, provide prominent, explosive close harmonies of the ‘90s folk rock sort lately repopularized by the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32493-girlpool/"">Girlpool</a>. Their voices are set to the sort of synthy, cavernous production that evokes an increasingly decontextualized version of the ‘80s.</p>
<p>It’s hard to talk about this sort of music without mentioning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"">Haim</a>, who've refurbished a lot of sounds formerly consigned to adult-hits radio to great acclaim; meanwhile, mainstream pop has been setting acoustic toplines to synths for the better part of this decade. And after the notably crunchier <i>Wildewoman</i>, Lucius is clearly moving in that direction. It’s not a bad look. Parts of <i>Good Grief </i>resemble a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2563-luscious-jackson/"">Luscious Jackson</a> record with the ‘90s electronica swapped out for its 2010s synthpop counterpart. Times have changed, and what might have sounded hopelessly overproduced then, or during the late ‘80s or whichever period Lucius is evoking on any particular track, comes off sparkling and large-stage in today’s musical world.</p>
<p>This is best demonstrated on<i> </i>the restrained “Truce” and exuberant single “Something About You,” both of which set folky hooks to spangly production. Most of <i>Good Grief</i>, however, leans more toward one end or the other. “You Were On My Mind” and “Madness,” with only minor adjustments for an acoustic setting, might work in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22283-indigo-girls/"">Indigo Girls</a> set, while “Dusty Trails,” befitting its title, is a slow plod of guitar and high-lonesome harmonies. At the other end of the spectrum, “Born Again Teen” worships a Holy Trinity of “Kids in America,” ‘50s rock and hyper-compression. A breathless sprint much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"">Chairlift’</a>s “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17850-chairlift-romeo/"">Romeo</a>,” it’s an easy standout. Bonus track ""Let's Dance"" plays a neat trick of reproducing in acoustic form the stuttered and sampled textures that are near-ubiquitous in pop. Elsewhere, on “Gone Insane,” Lucius taunts you with the prospect of breaking out into The Proclaimers' “500 Miles” before settling on more obvious multi-tracked wailing. It's perhaps a cliché for the title, but it does make for a suitably ferocious sound that Wolf and Laessig’s voices are more than capable of stirring up.</p>
<p>As put-together as <i>Good Grief</i>’s presentation is, and as ingratiating as its songs are, the record suffers from a distinct lack of identity. “Some of the band wanted it to sound like an avant-garde, German experimental record, and some of them wanted a straight pop record, as far as referencing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/"">Taylor Swift</a>,” <a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/music/how-luciuss-second-album-drove-them-to-go-above-beyond-and-nearly-insane-8367850"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">producer Shawn Everett told the <i>Village Voice</i></a>. The argument seems to have been resolved via compromise, making <i>Good Grief </i>sound like everything at once but nothing in particular. In that interview, the band is very specific about their influences, the sort of disparate chunks on songs easy to isolate in an instant-streaming age: the drums from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyonce</a>’s producer, the vocals on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4153-judee-sill/"">Judee Sill</a> track. Any one of these might make for a good, cohesive album, but like so many acts with newfound popularity and a sophomore record, the issue’s settling upon one.</p></div>"|21730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21730-good-grief/|6.3|Katherine St. Asaph

Its title was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21631-no-one-deserves-happiness/""><i>No One Deserves Happiness</i></a> and its sound matched the sentiment. But traditionally Buford and guitarist Chip King have used their many collaborations (in the past two years alone they've made full lengths with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19970-you-whom-i-have-always-hated/"">Thou</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21201-the-body-krieg/"">Krieg</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29783-vampillia/"">Vampillia</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19180-the-body-i-shall-die-here/"">the Haxan Cloak</a>) for something a little more fun, relatively speaking—a chance to at least stretch the boundaries of their slow, sickly grinding compositions into unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That was never really an option when making a record with the Maryland grindcore four-piece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32595-full-of-hell/"">Full of Hell</a>; the two groups share too much in common. The Body work in textured, patient torture, death by a thousand cuts, whereas Full of Hell operate more like a woodchipper—but they’re united in the all-consuming gloom that consumes all of their best work. Bearing a title culled from one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2544-courtney-love/"">Courtney Love</a>'s most famously vindictive proclamations,<i> One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache</i> is a document of the overwhelming power of depression. It's not life-affirming, as Buford seems to argue, but the sheer force of the sound makes a compelling argument for diving into the black anyway.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And that’s sort of what they do. From the record’s opening moments, a subwoofer-rumbling kick drum and a snare trace the edges of an abyss before Full of Hell vocalist Dylan Walker’s steel-wool vocals give you a shove. The effect, especially as it bleeds into the sample-apocalypse of “Fleshworks” is something like standing uncomfortably close to a late-period Rothko canvas—the distressed blues and blacks expand to fill your whole field of vision and any shifts are more textural than tonal. It’s one-dimensional in the same sense that those final paintings were, fixated on the void in a way that’s emotionally affecting—monomania can be compelling, after all.</p>
<p>Throughout they’re taking risks, abandoning straightforward metal trappings to pile noxious noise blasts on shredded 808s (“Bottled Urn”) or turning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"">Leonard Cohen</a> ballads into doom-metal dystopias (though the hypodermic fantasies and Christian imagery on<i> Songs for a Room</i>’s “The Butcher” make that a pretty easy task). But even as they explore alien aesthetics, the Body and Full of Hell are constantly finding ways to uphold the spirit of each other's work. They’re united in their disposition, up until the record’s final moment, a sample of the HBO movie <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132623/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>You Don’t Know Jack</i></a> that seems to sum up what precedes it: “Loss, loss, loss, loss, loss.”</p></div>"|21684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21684-the-body-full-of-hell-one-day-you-will-ache-like-i-ache/|7.6|Colin Joyce

A rangy young man from Oldham, Greater Manchester, Leonard picked up the mandolin aged five, and wrote his breakout 2013 song ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15455-kiran-leonard-dear-lincoln/"">Dear Lincoln</a>"" – a manic piece of psychedelic pop, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8485-van-dyke-parks/"">Van Dyke Parks</a> reincarnated in the body of a hyperactive English schoolboy – when he was 14 years old. Currently ensconced at Oxford University's Wadham College, where he's studying Spanish and Portuguese, Leonard is an intellectual sponge drinking up an ocean of knowledge. His frame of reference encompasses playwright Samuel Beckett and the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the mangled productions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"">Death Grips</a> and the brainbox pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6330-elephant-6/"">Elephant 6</a>, while ""Pink Fruit"" – the second song on this, his second LP – is a sprawling song suite with more twists and turns in its 16 minutes than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"">Slint</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19182-slint-spiderland-remastered-box-set/""><i>Spiderland</i></a>. The crux of its peculiar lyric? An erotic encounter between a woman and a squid.</p>
<p>It's a lot, right? Right. <i>Grapefruit</i> is by turns astounding, accomplished and difficult to digest, an album shouldering ambitions so big that you fear that at any point it might give way at the knees. Undoubtedly, Leonard is an autodidact of amazing talent and energy. At times his idiosyncratic performance style resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9992-dave-longstreth/"">Dave Longstreth</a> – see ""Don't Make Friends With Good People,"" with those wandering, pointillist guitar lines, that voice that leaps boldly across octaves, as if participating in some tipsy parkour. Elsewhere, he recalls a fellow British outsider, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32553-richard-dawson/"">Richard Dawson</a>, whose take on the narrative folk tradition is both wild-eyed and whimsical. The lolloping, rusty groove of ""Öndör Gongor"" is a fractured song-story sketched in enigmatic strokes – a strapping maritime fantasy set ""in the night of the shotgun,"" in which sharks lurk as ""a clatter of shins hit the dock"" and a mysterious orb named Ethel waits, hungrily. The song ends with staccato blasts of guitar and a chanted shanty-like coda, although how all this relates to the subject of the song's title – a giant who lived in early-20th century Mongolia – is left unaddressed.</p>
<p><i>Grapefruit</i> is a gnarlier-sounding record than its predecessor, its lurching guitars and skittering, free percussion recalling math-rock luminaries such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1127-don-caballero/"">Don Caballero</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3955-storm-and-stress/"">Storm &amp; Stress</a>. It is at its most digestible, however, when Leonard plays it orchestral. ""Caiaphas in Fetters"" is a beautiful confection of strings and fluttering guitar that finds him posing questions to a lover: ""Ask yourself/Do you feel as I feel?"" ""Half Ruined Already,"" meanwhile, is a fingerpicked love song in which two participants – one legless, one armless – come together in one romantic whole. It was inspired by a Werner Herzog short about a couple who met in a leper's colony, but succeeds in taking such grim subject matter and alchemizing it into warm sentiment. At the other end of the scale is the somewhat opaque ""Exeter Services,"" which flips between quizzical improv and skidding emo, all flail and gasp and rickety cathedrals of language built to collapse: ""I'm in the Catskills! Total duality! All of Ophelia! Absolute anarchy!""</p>
<p><i>Grapefruit</i> is 57 minutes long and feels packed to the rafters, as if Leonard is a hoarder of ideas and song fragments, unwilling or unable to let anything go. Take ""Pink Fruit."" In its 16 minutes, it flits between noisy spazz-rock, folk shambling, woodwind interludes, short-wave radio tinkering and free percussion. I'd stop short of calling it confused – even when it's getting wild, there's enough recurring lyrical cues to suggest its maker is working to a detailed map. But he can be rather an impatient guide, and while the ground it covers is startling and often picturesque, <i>Grapefruit</i> is an album you feel led through, rather than being left to explore or inhabit. Perhaps in this regard, at least, Kiran Leonard still has things to learn.</p></div>"|21727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21727-grapefruit/|7.0|Louis Pattison

She had the kind of look that parents hate (her hair was pink, or blue, or no-way-that’s-natural blonde, her midriff was perpetually exposed) and a punk-ish sneer, and she was at her finest when she was all riled up. She was also, crucially, a product of the post-grunge alternative landscape, in which an Orange County ska band could edge up their sound and land a song on the Top 10 for 15 weeks. As popular music tastes shifted, so did Stefani—and shrewdly, for a time. She first tested the solo waters in 2000, duetting with Moby on the deadpan banger “South Side” before moving on to an even more unlikely partner in crime, Eve, with “Let Me Blow Ya Mind” (i.e. the “Fancy” of 2001). Around this same time, No Doubt’s new wave sheen turned towards Jamaican dancehall, which made Stefani’s own pivot towards hip-hop feel more natural. In hindsight, that hip-hop lean—like Stefani’s <a href=""http://time.com/3524847/gwen-stefani-racist-harajuku-girls/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">other acts</a> <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/06/the-uproar-over-no-doubt-s-native-american-video-gaffe.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">of cultural</a> <a href=""https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/a-cultural-history-of-white-girls-wearing-bindis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">appropriation</a>—was questionable taste-wise, not least because it encouraged Fergie. But like much of her career up to that point, Gwen had enough attitude to pull it off.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Stefani’s first solo album, 2004’s<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7789-love-angel-music-baby/""> Love. Angel. Music. Baby.</a></i>, had a few legitimately great singles, the kind of radio hits that take a surprisingly long time to wear out. She also drew inspiration from unexpected places;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rlNpWYQunY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> one of those songs</a> reinterpreted <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> for the Juicy Couture crowd,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgjkth6BRRY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> another</a> singlehandedly ensured that the word “bananas” would never again be misspelled by millennials. Her 2006 Neptunes-assisted follow-up,<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9703-the-sweet-escape/""> The Sweet Escape</a></i>, was essentially a dashed-off photocopy of its predecessor without the hits; given that weak showing, and then the eventual No Doubt reunion, it started to feel like Gwen solo was no longer a priority, at least until she joined the cast of ""The Voice."" No one joins ""The Voice"" if they’re just trying to hawk their (mostly tasteful)<a href=""http://www.shoplamb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> clothing line</a>. By the time a concrete announcement heralding Stefani’s solo return arrived, she had repositioned herself towards the current mainstream once again.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So who is Gwen Stefani in the year 2016? You might say she’s an ageless pop star dealing with her personal drama not just in the tabloids, but on record. While this is a familiar and effective strategy for selling albums, it’s also a jaded way to perceive <i>This Is What the Truth Feels Like</i>, in part because Stefani—who co-wrote every song—seems to be genuinely torn over her own identity here. Long forgotten is the novelty that initially came with watching Gwen go full “TRL” and bring her inspiring weirdness to the masses. Here, she plays a different kind of role model: the quintessential divorcee, fresh off her messy split from Gavin Rossdale. Stefani forces herself to look forward as she navigates the thrill and insecurity of dating for the first time this millennium (ostensibly hand-in-hand with <a href=""http://www.people.com/article/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-friendship-turned-romantic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he who shall not be named</a>), but sometimes, she just can’t help looking back in anger and regret.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As she did on her first two solo albums, Stefani spends a bit of time trend-hopping through current Top 40, from the spacious trap-lite of “You’re My Favorite” to the Bieber-hits-the-islands vibe of sext ode “Send Me a Picture” to “Asking 4 It,” where Fetty Wap slur-raps the album’s sole feature atop an unconvincing beat. These are decent tracks that affirm her ability to keep up with big pop of the moment (or rather, of a year ago), but musically, they are unremarkable, and fail to match the unique specificity of her early solo hits. There’s only one “Gwen Gets Back On the Horse” song that really works—second single “Make Me Like You,” a disco confection that captures the deliciously complicated feeling of falling hard when you least expected.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Stefani’s focus on the good times alternates with songs where she expresses cartoonish anger by awkwardly rapping and shouting non-sequiturs (“Naughty,” “Red Flag”), and neither mode plays to her strengths as a songwriter and signature vocalist. Her best songs are the ones in which she is audibly upset—sometimes pissed off, sometimes sad, but best-case scenario, both. No Doubt’s “Don’t Speak” was a heartbreak anthem with a twinge of anger, but with <i>Truth</i> lead single “Used to Love You,” Stefani—now 20 years wiser—flips it. “You can keep all the memories,” she tosses off nonchalantly, but still she sheds a tear as she backs out their driveway for the last time. It’s a rare moment on the album where you can pick out Stefani from a sea of other pop singers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">“Used to Love You” might be the greatest song Stefani has been involved in since “Don’t Speak,” at first twinkling all sad-sweet like Dev Hynes DJ’ing a prom slow-dance in an ‘80s teen flick. But by the end of the song, it has grown into something resembling a secular take on “Like a Prayer""'s climax, its sheer size threatening to teeter over the top. As the strings and the choir build around her, Stefani curls her voice up into a bow to emphasize the “used to” in “used to love you,” conveying both vulnerability and strength as she often had two decades ago. More than a decade has passed since Gwen Stefani first went pop, but it’s the fleeting moments like this—where she reminds us why we used to love her—that redeem <i>This Is What the Truth Feels Like</i>.</p></div>"|21647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21647-this-is-what-the-truth-feels-like/|5.9|Jillian Mapes

The set splits 13 tracks unevenly between the artists; Boris takes credit for nine, while Merzbow can claim four. But compare the track lengths—add them up, even—and you'll notice that, collectively, the running time for Merzbow's contributions essentially equals that of Boris' drum-less recreations of its greatest hits. The halves are meant to be started and played simultaneously, so that the mixing between the two happens in real-time and at the high volumes facilitated by two separate sound systems. It's a more modest rendition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8017-time-capsule/?page=6"" target=""_blank"">The Flaming Lips's <i>Zaireeka</i>,</a> enhanced by the twist of partnership between these longtime collaborators.</p>
<p>Don't be surprised if, upon first spin, <i>Gensho</i> sounds like a mess, or if listening to the whole 75-minute cycle gets exhausting. Boris and Merzbow, of course, are dual institutions of loudness; the former has a classic called <i>Amplifier Worship</i>, the latter a masterpiece called <i>Sonic Command</i>. At times here, they seem to go at one another's throat, Merzbow's spirals of clipped-and-mangled signals lashing out against Boris' honeyed drone.</p>
<p>Each time you run this gauntlet, you will undoubtedly notice new cooperative nuances between the two acts, particularly moments when Merzbow seems to be working to fit inside Boris' world and to augment it. When the band lurches into ""Sometimes,"" for instance, with sweeping guitar chords moving like tectonic plates beneath airy vocals, he locks into a sustained signal and guilds it with quick, near-manic cuts. It's as though he's adding a bass line and his version of a blast beat to the low, slow rumble. He's almost playful during ""Akuma No Uta,"" countering the band's grand, ascendant riff with a crosstalk of dissonant bits and shards. Such moments, though, are either so few and far between or so constant (it's hard to determine which, really) on <i>Gensho</i> that the entire experience becomes more arduous than enjoyable. Both Merzbow and Boris have built enormous legacies by being monolithic in sound and singular in style, but those assets become liabilities here.</p>
<p>Listening to these sets separately is actually the more interesting experience. The two-part ""Goloka"" suite, which takes the middle 40 minutes of Merzbow's contribution, finds the master in all his versatile glory. He slides seamlessly between electroacoustic radiance and concussive punishment, between drones that are nearly pleasant and scrambles that suggest all the world's servers stalling at once. And the nine preexisting songs that Boris chose for this set—the tidal ""Farewell,"" the snarling ""Vomitself,"" the floating ""Rainbow""—are among the landmarks in an enormous catalog. Re-created here without drums, they're newly fascinating, with forgotten elements pulled suddenly into the spotlight. Boris' side of <i>Gensho</i> is the band's most assured and purely pleasurable album in years. As if knowing they'll be overshadowed by Merzbow's volume, anyway, the trio seems to be enjoying itself here, delighting its way through the classics of its own canon. Perhaps it's best to think of <i>Gensho</i>, then, as a split box set.</p>
<p>Still, particularly for this era of instant, easy access to almost everything, <i>Gensho </i>is an intriguing, subversive concept. It makes the listener work to hear the music as it's intended, and that process allows the listener input as to how, exactly, the music should be heard. Which side should be louder? Who gets the right channel? Should the stereos used be the same? <i>Gensho </i>feels delightfully out of step with our present notions of convenience, our belief that music should practically <i>come to us</i> if it wants to be heard. It's not quite so extreme as the infamous Merzcar, <a href=""http://jawkdna.com/blog/?p=13"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in which Merzbow's <i>Noisembryo</i> </a>was locked crypt-style into the CD player of a decrepit Mercedez-Benz, but it's <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-20/why-adele-isn-t-streaming-her-new-album-on-spotify-or-apple"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">certainly more involved than Adele circumventing Spotify.</a></p>
<p>Alas, that challenge is the most lasting aspect of the least rewarding partnership between Boris and Merzbow to date. By the fourth or fifth trip through <i>Gensho</i>, the idea begins to slip into pure gimmickry, as though this were a notion that sounded fun for old friends to try but isn't so fun to hear. What's more, Boris' decision to plunder its back catalog for such an album dovetails with the recent feeling that this band, no matter how hard it tries, is simply running out of ground and energy. They couldn't even be bothered to write new songs for this old, borrowed concept. At least it's good to revisit the ghosts of a force that seems to be fading.</p></div>"|21672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21672-gensho/|5.7|Grayson Haver Currin

The group’s revolving team of singers and songwriters (everybody but the drummer takes a turn on the mic) chronicle knotty relationships and winding road trips, but taken together, these songs are after something more public than personal. Asked by the blog <a href=""https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/rolling-blackouts-coastal-fever"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Triple J Unearthed</a> what inspires the band, singer-guitarist Fran Keaney hinted at their music’s true subject: “It’s going to sound all at once lame, wanky and vague but: Australia? As in the concept of Australia. What it was, What it is…”</p>
<p>There are too many qualifiers in that response to believe he’s taking the piss on a question that’s impossible to answer. And on <i>Talk Tight</i>, the band evokes certain aspects of Australia in the sunbaked surf-pop guitar licks and taut punk momentum, both carefree and a little cautious and therefore perfect for a country that’s home to <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/20/australia-funnel-web-deadliest-spider-in-world"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this fucking thing</a>. Listening to these seven tunes, you can easily trace a national lineage: the relentlessness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3511-radio-birdman/"">Radio Birdman</a>, the pop literacy of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">Go-Betweens</a>, the rambunctious energy of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23488-the-easybeats/"">Easybeats</a>, and the belief—shared with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31640-courtney-barnett/"">Courtney Barnett</a>—that guitars are not just crucial to the message but might very well be the message themselves.</p>
<p>Even in Melbourne, which seems to produce more great guitar bands per capita than any other city in the world, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever stand out for the precision of their melodies, the streamlined sophistication of their arrangements, and the undercurrent of melancholy that motivates every note. This is a band that thrives on contradiction and duality, pitting opposing urges against each other. To describe their own sound, the members coined the term “tough pop/soft punk,” which is apt as a label as well as a refusal to pare themselves down to any one particular thing.</p>
<p>As that awkward name suggests, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever often sound like they’re in fact two different bands. There’s the group behind midtempo opener “Wither With You,” which falls squarely in the “tough pop” category. In this mode, each instrument contributes to a swirl of melody and the guitars chime and ramble as Tom Russo chronicles the strained dissolution of a relationship: “Oh your pretty face is curling up in anger,” he sings, in a tone that might deepen rather than defuse her fury. “Just keep in mind, my darling, I did it all for you.” Keeping it from sounding bitter is the nimble rhythm section, the genial snap of Marcel Tussie’s drums and Joe Russo’s loping bassline. Here and on “Tender Is the Neck,” the group foreground mood over momentum, establishing an autumnal ambience that underscores the bittersweet reminiscence of the lyrics.</p>
<p>The band’s other mode is to play at the punk end of the Aussie spectrum, closer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28185-royal-headache/"">Royal Headache</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28433-eddy-current-suppression-ring/"">Eddy Current Suppression Ring</a>. The tempos quicken noticeably, with half-shouted vocals and guitars that fight not for the lead but for the rhythm parts. Tussie and Russo chug along diligently, as though timekeeping were the true rock star’s responsibility. You hear it in songs like “Wide Eyes,” a fierce travelogue that explodes with tightly coiled jangle and angsty wanderlust. They might be too soft to trash a club, but the Blackouts ably wring the last bit of tension from the skeletal “Clean Slate,” with its intricate curlicue riffs and fidgety call-and-response.</p>
<p>The great trick of <i>Talk Tight</i> is how Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever find the overlap between those conflicting pop and punk impulses. Even at their fiercest they’re happy romantics (“You run the bath, and I’ll warm the pasta, girl”) as well as sensualists (“Your hair stands up when I kiss the back of your neck”), qualities that seem rare in any band. Rarer still is their precarious balance of idealism and realism, which defines the closer, “Career,” about a friend who traded his rebellion and defiance for “a silk tie and an ’09 Ford.” It might sound dismissive and taunting if Russo and Keaney didn’t sound half-tempted themselves. They’re wise to the compromises that accrue with the years, but they’d rather stay on the road, rumbling through Australia and beyond like a tidal wave obliterating every coast.</p></div>"|21739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21739-talk-tight/|8.0|Stephen M.

That same sense of digital constriction extends to music, a place filled with lukewarm takes and fast food restaurants <a href=""https://twitter.com/Whataburger/status/703431859082952704"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">toddling towards relevance</a>. It’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/773-pc-music-hipster-runoff-and-the-year-of-the-internet-hangover/"" target=""_blank"">overwhelming</a>, but not hopeless. Plenty of artists have carved out space online where they can create new communities and explore new sounds. They exist far from the regular churn of the Web, just waiting for like-minded people to find them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Japan’s “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/starter/9554-10-essential-japanese-netlabels/"" target=""_blank"">netlabel</a>” scene has offered this escape for nearly 15 years. Online imprints such as <a href=""http://maltinerecords.cs8.biz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maltine Records</a> and <a href=""http://bunkai-kei.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bunkai-Kei Records</a> gave space for young producers with little way of entering the country’s mainstream music industry to experiment—not to mention provide an alternative to a club culture hampered by <a href=""http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2012/09/23/general/antidancing-law-out-of-step-with-japans-youth-culture/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">laws straight out of <i>Footloose</i></a>. One of the bigger names to emerge in the Japanese netlabel world recently is <a href=""http://www.trekkie-trax.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trekkie Trax</a>, a collective launched by a few 20-somethings in 2012 that has put out around 50 releases from a global roster of talent and developed a reputation for energetic in-real-life shows across Tokyo. <i>Trekkie Trax the Best 2012-2015</i> compiles some of the label’s finest cuts, and serves as a great introduction to one of Japan’s best outfits bubbling up from the Internet.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Trekkie Trax’s emergence parallels the Japanese commercial boom in EDM, and many moments on this compilation feature elements of the genre. It’s natural for the young artists here to be attracted to hard-hitting sounds aimed at listeners their age, but the results end up mixed when they cling too closely to the style. <i>The Best</i> lags when simply trying to replicate a buzzy Skrillex drop or Middle-Eastern-tinged Diplo hook, but shines when a producer finds a new angle to the familiar. Masayashi Iimori’s “Break It” draws from the aggressive stylings of trap all the way down to the air horn samples, but offsets the hyped-up centers with longer passages that ramp up the drama significantly. AMUNOA's “Cinderella Song (VIP)” uses similarly clanging beats and vocal samples to get things going, but dusts them with wispy synthesizer that adds an emotional longing to the track.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Youthfulness ultimately helps the Trekkie Trax crew stand out, the artists appearing on <i>The Best</i> capturing the energy of early adulthood when anything seems possible. They are digital natives, producers who grew up with the Web and are eager to throw as many ideas as possible into their dance tracks. Snail’s House embraces elements evoking Japan’s “kawaii” culture—helium-injected vocals, big colorful keyboard notes—on “Kirara,” while matra magic plunks snippets of Lil Wayne between gloopy synth drips. Kyoto's In the Blue Shirt combines split-second vocal slices with breezy ocarina on “Free Will,” but he engineers this potentially twee patchwork into a bouncy blast of sunshine. These moments come off like personal details woven into high-BPM numbers, a chance to add character to numbers that function best as uptempo club cuts.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For all the wonkiness, the label is at their best when barreling forward. Tokyo’s Carpainter gives UK garage a spin on “Journey to the West,” delivering a woozy number propelled by tribal percussion and opting to slowly reveal new details over a consistently driving tempo rather than build up to a huge moment of release. Even better is duo Lolica Tonica’s “Make Me Feel,” a jittery electro-rush somewhere between breakcore and Jersey Club. On a collection full of songs featuring vocal samples tripping over themselves, “Make Me Feel” is a highlight thanks to pure exuberance, nailing the nervous excitement of just letting loose.</p>
<p>Trekkie Trax didn’t reinvent anything over the last three years—artists in the Maltine Records universe laid down this path years ago, and those in Trekkie Trax point to Maltine as a massive influence on them. Rather, they are shepherding the netlabel spirit to the next generation of Japanese listeners, while also making a greater push internationally by using the net as an amplifier to spread electronic music from artists hailing from places rarely getting the same attention as their Western equals. <i>The Best </i>offers a concise gateway into their world, highlighting the sonic diversity of their crew and their intensity. They found room online to share their energy, and are using the Internet to bring it to anyone looking for an alternative.</p></div>"|21614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21614-trekkie-trax-the-best-2012-2015/|7.2|Patrick St. Michel

Emcees like Eagle, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"">Action Bronson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29-aesop-rock/"">Aesop Rock</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30228-homeboy-sandman/"">Homeboy Sandman</a> have this uncanny way of drawing you into what they say, despite unusual references that don’t always connect. Theirs is a conversational cadence full of random observations; and with Eagle, he can discuss wrestler Rick Martel’s cologne and the struggles of being a black man with the same verve, even if those topics are completely dissimilar. Eagle comes off like the everyman with whom you can talk about anything, an alternative to trap-rap, although he’s dexterous enough to drift in all sorts of directions.</p>
<p>Take last year’s “<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mellomusicgroup/open-mike-eagle-raps-for-when-its-just-you-and-the-abyss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Raps for When It’s Just You and the Abyss</a>” as an example: Beneath a slow churning instrumental, you can see Eagle methodically pacing back and forth, pulling disparate factoids from his brain: “Was pretty geeked about <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/music/open-mike-eagle-is-indie-raps-sharpest-funniest-social-critic-5304481"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my <i>L.A. Weekly</i> feature</a>/ I showed it to my dad, my barber and my piano teacher.” On “A History of Modern Dance,” the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30428-jeremiah-jae/"">Jeremiah Jae</a>-produced standout of Eagle’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19477-open-mike-eagle-dark-comedy/""><i>Dark Comedy</i></a> LP, he connects equally scattered thoughts using melodic flows: “People walk into circles … every audience listens … they taking turns judging … everybody got issues.” It doesn’t matter how Eagle conveys his messages, the songs end up feeling direct and honest, as if he’s looking you squarely in the face to make sure you get the point.</p>
<p>There’s no shortage of peculiar insight on <i>Hella Personal Film Festival</i>, Eagle’s collaborative album with British producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29949-paul-white/"">Paul White</a>. On “Drunk Dreaming,” he envisions President Obama in a small drone and sees Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on a moving bus. He flubs rhymes on “I Went Outside Today” and trails off slightly on “Dive Bar Support Group.” The mistakes probably wouldn’t work for most rappers, but in Eagle’s case, it makes him even more relatable. For roughly 46 minutes, he observes life with the same gusto he always has, except these songs play like short movies set in a different era. The track titles are quirky—“Dang is Invincible,” “A Short About a Guy That Dies Every Night,” “Admitting the Endorphin Addiction”—and the content is largely esoteric, yet Eagle tempers it just enough for broader consumption.</p>
<p>On “<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mellomusicgroup/open-mike-eagle-paul-white-check-to-check"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check to Check</a>,” for instance, he riffs on society’s obsession with smartphones, the fact that we can’t function without looking at our devices every few minutes. White creates a frenetic cosmic funk beat that exemplifies life’s rapid pace, and Eagle darts through it with a nervous energy that complements the track: “Battery getting low, but it’s not quite out yet/ So check, I’m in ya house now checkin’ for outlets/ I need to use maps ‘cause I don’t know the route yet/ I need to see an email, I don’t know when the soundcheck.” The song, which sits near the album’s beginning, is the best example of Eagle and White’s synergy. The beat shifts with each verse, growing more infectious as the rapper grows more restless. </p>
<p><i>Festival</i> feels steeped in ’70s soul—from the guitar lick on “Admitting the Endorphin Addiction” to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14762-i-plan-to-stay-a-believer-the-inside-songs-of-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a>-style harp on “I Went Outside Today.” White’s music fades further back as the album plays; songs like “Protectors of the Heat” and “Insecurity Part II” are made up of simple mouth clicks, light drums, and scant keys. Overall, the album begins quickly before it slows to a moderate pace, on which Eagle fills the second half with self-assessing thoughts on race (“Smiling”) and societal despair (“Reprieve”).</p>
<p>It makes sense that Eagle and White would come together for a project like this. Separately, they hit similar creative marks and speak to the same alt-rap demographic, despite taking divergent paths to get there. <i>Festival</i> is refreshingly cohesive, exploring varied themes without drifting off-course. Then again, that’s not saying much for Eagle and White, who’ve long established their own unique lanes. These songs foreshadow a much larger story, one that only these two can tell.</p></div>"|21617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21617-hella-personal-film-festival/|7.3|Marcus J. Moore
