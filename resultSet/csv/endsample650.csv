Whatever you think of his first band, Hebden's subsequent career can be seen as the idea of post-rock done right. His appetite for music, on the evidence presented in his albums, singles, DJ sets, and collaborations, is voracious. But Hebden has a way of transforming and integrating influences rather than channeling them. So if his loose improvised collaborations with drummer Steve Reid captured something of the spirit of the classic late-60s free jazz records on Impulse!, they also managed to carve out a unique and identifiable aesthetic that sounds very much like today. When working with others, like the wooly free-folk unit Sunburned Hand of the Man or the dubstep producer Burial, Hebden knows when to lead and when to get out of the way. But all the while, whatever the context, he's absorbing. And when it comes to his own records as Four Tet, he has a knack for combining sounds from all over and making them his own.</p>
<p><i>Rounds</i> is the one undisputed Four Tet classic, but all are at least good. It's not unusual for Four Tet records to have a few dull patches, but given Hebden's M.O., that's never a big problem. You expect him to explore a bit, so it's okay when once in a while something doesn't quite gel. <i>Ringer</i>, an intriguing EP from 2008 that throbbed with a minimal pulse and revealed a surprisingly austere side to his music, is a good example. It was the kind of record you wanted to inch closer to, because you had the sense there might be more going on beneath the surface than you'd initially realized. The follow-up album, <i>There Is Love in You</i>, is the glorious sound of those ideas being drawn into the light.</p>
<p>This is the most focused Four Tet album by a huge margin, and for some listeners that could be an issue. Hebden apparently refined this music over the course of a long stint as a resident DJ at the London club Plastic People. He'd play developing tracks in his sets, see how people responded, and return to them armed with this information. And while the result isn't dance music proper, <i>There Is Love in You</i> definitely functions on that plane. This isn't fist-pumping music that toys with the pleasure of pop music, like one of my favorite Four Tet tunes, ""Smile Around the Face"". And it's not an album that bowls you over with the density and intricacy of its textures. Instead, it's both heady and physical, subtle but powerful music for thinking and moving or ideally doing both at the same time: It's been a while since a brisk walk through the city sounded this good.</p>
<p>Very early in the 2000s, the corny word ""folktronica"" was sometimes applied to Four Tet's style. It never defined him, but the tag was applied because it described his fondness for samples of sounds that seem to be reverberating in a physical space. He sampled jazz cymbals, guitars, gamelan-style percussion, and voices, mixing them in with electronic squiggles and choppy breaks culled from hip-hop. Hebden's fondness for acoustic sounds caused his music to come over as unusually airy and bright. It made you think of daylight rather than the nocturnal crackle of sampled vinyl. Though <i>Love</i> is a very different album from those earlier records, remnants of the sound palette remain, imparting a similar sense of clarity, brightness, and warmth despite its late-night club-bound inspiration.</p>
<p>The album begins with a crisp cymbal tap on ""Angel Echoes"" that sounds perfectly live until a quick digital stutter comes a few bars in, and then a clipped female voice, reduced to just syllables but still conveying a strong sense of yearning, begins looping into view. There are bells, a steady midtempo 4/4 kick, and that voice, and that's about it. But ""Angel Echoes"", like most of the record that follows, is strangely moving in spite of its limited toolkit. After it ends abruptly and tumbles into the brilliant ""Love Cry"", a much more drawn-out and darkly shaded tune, it starts to become clear that another inspiration could be in play: the music produced by Hebden's schoolmate, Will Bevan aka Burial.</p>
<p>The pair collaborated on an intriguing two-track 12"" last year, and if nothing else, Hebden's consistent return here to the texture and expressive possibilities of vocal fragments forms a clear link. ""Sing"", halfway through the record, is the most affecting and flat-out gorgeous example of the technique, as it laces the propulsive housey rhythmic thrust-- the push and pull of the kick and snare, bits of percussion, a short and repetitive synth motif-- with an alien, genderless voice that curls into a kind of weary howl. The effect reminds me of nothing so much as the ""ah-AH-ah"" vocals that snake through Aphex Twin's immortal ""Windowlicker"", and Hebden's processing gives ""Sing"" a similar sense of simultaneous grounding and weird dislocation.</p>
<p>Hebden has studied Aphex Twin carefully, having made his first splash in 1999 when he remixed a track from <i>SAW II</i> for one of Warp's 10th Anniversary compilations. Elsewhere on <i>Love</i>, you can find the creative melding of beats and classical minimalism that producers like Richard James and Nobukazu Takemura were exploring in the 90s. An array of metallic percussion pops up, organized into hypnotic grid-like patterns that gradually build and change over the track's duration. The voice sample in ""Circling"" doesn't appear until two-thirds of the way through the track's runtime, and it brings with it a cluster of bright electronic tones that call to mind the iconic pulse of Reich/Riley minimalism. The loping, sleepy ""This Unfolds"" has several layers of quietly twinkling sound happening at once, and you can shift your perception to follow along with any one of them or simply let the whole thing wash over you. Though it mostly lays back and doesn't waste any notes, <i>There Is Love in You</i> always has just enough going on to pull you back in any time you feel like relegating it to the background. It works best taken whole, rather than broken into individual tracks.</p>
<p>Whenever <i>There Is Love in You</i> comes to the closing ""She Just Likes to Fight"", a quietly pretty instrumental built around a straightforward guitar melody, I start thinking of Hebden's early days. There's a moment at the 2:18 mark where the music pauses for a moment as a tapped guitar harmonic rings out, and it brings me back for a split-second to ""Harmonics"", the acoustic guitar instrumental that is the one Fridge tune I love without reservation. It's such a basic and elemental thing, the overtones of one metal guitar string vibrating in place, but in the right hands it becomes a tool that can be used to deliver a surprising blast of feeling. The simple power of sound is something this guy has understood from the beginning.</p></div>"|13861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13861-there-is-love-in-you/|8.6|Mark Richardson

They're dependent on missing imagery, and often released mainly as advertisements for the films. But when a beloved band's name is on the cover, we can't help but feel as if we're being promised a little more-- that the release has an aesthetic motivation beyond the promotional. If Hans-Christian Schmid's film, <i>Storm</i>, has fans, then perhaps this score will be useful to them. But it will do little for any but the most adoringly blinkered Notwist fans. It's so thin and generic that selling it as a Notwist record feels faintly deceitful, as it could be by anybody, for any moody indie film.</p>
<p>Brevity is great when it's focused around moving themes or a sense of development, but the microtonal squalls and static melodies the Notwist work in here need more time to sink in, and are unproductive when portioned out over 11 tracks in under half an hour. Perhaps they suit the film wonderfully. This is the Notwist's second collaboration with Schmid, so something must click there. But out of context, it just sounds like they gathered up all the usual haunting-soundtrack materials around them-- glockenspiels and bowed xylophones, minimal pianos and strings, pressurized electronic loops-- and failed to do anything with them except idle in a low gear. Certainly nothing offends the ear, barring perhaps the shrill ridges of tone that compose the entirety of ""Simon"". But the score comes to its quick conclusion with a distinct sense of, ""That's it?""</p>
<p>There's something bloodless about these pieces that dulls the impact of even time-proven soundtrack tricks. The stiff two-note piano figure on ""Vilna Kosa Version"" (featuring the Andromeda Mega Express Orchestra) gestures toward unease without actually producing any, like a blank-faced actor holding a sign that says ""anxious."" The sonar pulse of ""The Hague"" eventually snaps into a canned trip-hop beat with grim inevitability. Flashes of potency-- the delicately tactile polyrhythms of ""Sarajevo 1"" and ""2"", and the restrained martial peals of ""Storm 1""-- are just that, flashes. It's not <i>bad</i> music, mostly, but it's just like all the interstitial parts of a Notwist record knitted together, without any of their terrific songcraft to sustain them. Assuming that you have a limited record-buying budget (a fanciful notion that, presumably, bands selling albums nevertheless endorse), it's the definition of inessential.</p></div>"|13856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13856-sturm/|3.4|Brian Howe

They began as a backing crew for a singer-songwriter who since left the band, and now have pared down from three members to two since the release of their previous album, <i>High Time</i>. Before their last European tour as a duo, they started writing songs for just sampler, guitar, and voice-- in part to keep the energy level up throughout the set, and partly to travel light. This practically grounded aesthetic choice led to the songs on their dance- and R&amp;B-borrowing new album, which is likely the band's boldest step forward of their career.</p>
<p>Having previously fed on a diet of everything post-punk, the band's now opening up to rhythms and sounds from modern R&amp;B. ""Water"", with no guitar or live drums to speak of, opens the record on the most conspicuous shift, as singer Fay Davis-Jeffers tries out more direct, suggestive couplets, one a beat that nods to Timbaland's late-1990s heyday. That said, there's no mistaking it's them: The vocals of Davis-Jeffers are still somewhere between coy and detached, and on the following track, ""Nightroom"", the clean, minimal guitar that dominated the band's previous albums makes itself heard.</p>
<p>These are compelling parts, but rarely do the songs add up to more than their sum. There's a promising middle ground on tracks like ""Godspot"", where reverberating keys add hair-raising tension while guitar and keyboards duel around the main melody line. Some of Pit Er Pat's most pronounced rhythms are found on the faux-drum-circle workout ""Summer Rose"" and the extended runtime of ""Emperor of Charms""-- the closest they come here to breaking a sweat. But it's on the final track, ""Specimen"", where they take these elements somewhere more unexpected. Everything gets slowed to a menacing crawl, deep bass hits, the guitar buried under reverb, judicious echo on the drums, and a melodica sounding out a distress call.</p>
<p>Minimalism should be the common thread between the band's older music and the particular strain of pop they're channeling here, and yet they seem at odds in many of these tracks. Icy and stiff has been the band's M.O., but its new material demands performances that command that sparseness rather than toy with it. Had the band drawn on some of that confidence from R&amp;B as well as the instrumentation, it could have made this record even more compelling.</p></div>"|13825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13825-the-flexible-entertainer/|6.1|Jason Crock

They were more neo-classical than post-rock, but during their run from the early-mid 1990s to the early-mid 2000s, they seemed to fit nonetheless. Strangely, they weren't named for Grimes, but rather fellow member Jason Noble's Toyota Corolla. Still, she became somewhat synonymous with the band in the minds of its fans, even as she went on to work with King's Daughters &amp; Sons. <i>Book of Leaves</i>, her first solo album, is like a warm embrace from an old friend, carrying on in the same neo-classical vein as her old group, but now with only piano (and a few frogs).</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The starkness of the recording is a good match for the snow-covered world outside my window at this writing, but it works regardless of the weather. These compositions came together over years as Grimes has worked with her own bands and as a hired session player, but they have a natural flow from one to the next, with simple themes and chord changes preserving a consistent mood in all of them. One of the most arresting compositions is the second, ""Every Morning"". It proceeds without fuss through a series of small themes that pulse along, buoyed by dynamic contrast-- her playing mimics an echo. She reprises it with a bit more flourish on the penultimate track, the second time allowing distant bird sounds to mingle with the music.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Across the record she employs other field recordings from nature, though never with a lot of fanfare. The forest full of frogs on ""At the Pond"" is simply presented as a naturalistic interlude. Even when her animal pals are present, though, Grimes has crafted an album that sounds and feels truly solitary-- the halting chords of ""The Corner Room"", the frenetic interlocking melodies of ""My Dear Companion"" (a distant relative of Rachel's ""Arterial""), the sudden cascades of ""She Was Here"", and the chord sheets of ""Mossgrove"" all have the feel of creativity accessed while in between encounters with other people. That time between is something we all need now and then, and this record resonates primarily because of how well it embodies the nourishment of aloneness.</p></div>"|13798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13798-book-of-leaves/|7.1|Joe Tangari

But whatever level of devotion he engenders, Thompson seems determined to test.<span> </span>On <i>Five American Portraits</i>, Thompson and friends offer very long, very literal descriptions of five characters set loosely to a host of classic tunes. <i>Portraits</i> once again finds Thompson collaborating with Art &amp; Language as well as Jim O'Rourke and the Raincoats' Gina Birch. <span> </span>Each portrait is paired with two or three tracks befitting its background: Jimmy Carter set to ""Georgia on My Mind""; George W. Bush to ""I've Been Working on the Railroad""; Wile E. Coyote to Bo Diddley's ""Roadrunner"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The lyrics are expository, literal, and not necessarily helpful if you don't know what these figures look like.<span> </span>What could reasonably considered the first verse of ""John Wayne"" proceeds as follows: ""The dent on the right side of the crown/ Of the hat/ The outer surface of the right ear/ Some loose skin below the right eyelid/ A crease below the right eye.""<span> </span>Finally, after a handful of similar descriptions: ""...of John Wayne.""<span> </span>(Play along at home: resist the temptation to Google image search Ad Reinhardt.)<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Your first listen will probably result in a chuckle-- ""Oh, portraits!""-- and your eighth listen will probably result in a chuckle-- Jimmy Carter and Georgia-- and the rest of your listens will probably be confusing.<span> </span>The reason it will take you eight listens to identify ""Georgia on My Mind"" is because the band retains little distinguishing characteristics save chord progressions (the liner notes are helpful) and Thompson and Birch are even more liberal in their interpretations, even putting aside the fact that they're slotting in these stilted descriptions.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Birch is shriller and more assertive than the female vocalists Thompson yielded to on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10638-sighs-trapped-by-liars/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sighs Trapped by Liars</i></a>, which makes her a fine foil, but <i>Portraits</i>' best moments still come when the concepts lull and Thompson's voice settles in.<span> </span>Thompson warms over Bo's hiccupping licks on ""Wile E Coyote"", and he affects a not-as-gimmicky-as-you-might-think twang (he's from Houston, remember) during ""John Wayne"", which stands as one of the most listenable 15-minute tracks Thompson's ever been involved in.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Nothing in Thompson's history suggests he is above this sort of bullshit joke, nor is he tentative about art-for-art's sake and the easy answer to the question <i>Portraits</i> poses is ""It's both.""<span> </span>It's sort of a perfect concept for Thompson: it's not particularly clever or abstract but to actually gather the efforts, time, and resources to release this album-- straight-faced-- seems mad.<span> </span>At this point, though, those who delight in Thompson's particular madness will need no explanations.</p>

When Walt ""<i>Leaves of Grass</i>"" Whitman wrote that, in the 1855 debut edition of the poem that would become ""Song of Myself"", his subject certainly wasn't Wesley Pentz. But the Philadelphia DJ/producer known as Diplo-- alongside such fellow global travelers as DJ /rupture-- has been among the 21st century's most dauntless joiners of disparate musical cultures. Whether Baltimore club (parties starting in 2003 at Philly's Ukrainian Club), baile funk (2004/2005 <i>Favela</i> mixtapes), Alabama hip-hop (2008's Paper Route Gangstaz mixtape), or Jamaican dancehall (last year's Major Lazer album), Diplo has a musically unimpeachable track record of taking the world's streets' worthiest sounds out of the neighborhoods and into your earbuds.</p>
<p>With <i>Free Gucci (Best of the Cold War Mixtapes)</i>, a freely downloadable mixtape of remixes for Atlanta gangsta rapper Gucci Mane, all that jet lag may have finally caught up with him. Never mind the usual point-missing accusations of cultural tourism-- ""Having white kids talk about race on the internet is the dumbest thing in the world,"" Diplo told Pitchfork's own Tom Breihan in a 2007 <i>Village Voice</i> interview. When it comes to the MC born Radric Davis, ""the merge"" already happened. After a prolific series of high-profile guest appearances (Mariah Carey, Black Eyed Peas, Big Boi) and mixtapes (his <i>Cold War</i> trilogy flooded the blogs one day last November) all but guaranteed Lil Wayne comparisons, Gucci Mane's Warner-sponsored <i>The State vs. Radric Davis </i>debuted in December at #10 on the <i>Billboard</i> albums chart. <i>The New York Times</i> hailed the rapper as ""one of the most vigorous and exciting in recent memory"". I mean, sure-- baile funk, Alabama rap, and Jamaican dancehall each existed for years before Diplo got them in his crates. But he introduced them to listeners who probably wouldn't have been exposed to them otherwise. Gucci Mane needs no introduction.</p>
<p>Compared with Diplo's past projects, then, <i>Free Gucc</i>i has little reason to exist. In fact, despite the title, most of the tracks here weren't on the <i>Cold War</i> mixtapes at all-- the bulk come from last year's superior <i>The Burrprint: The Movie 3-D</i>. Anyway, all that stuff would be just as academic as arguments about cultural appropriation if the music itself banged. And <i>that's</i> the problem. Yeah, Gucci's slurry, word-drunk absurdism is a huge part of his appeal. And Diplo's remixers have picked some of the rapper's signature tracks. But Atlanta producers such as Drumma Boy and Zaytoven, with their pin-prick synths and sweaty lurch, are also crucial to Gucci's sound, as even Warner must've recognized by sticking to them and other Southern producers on the new studio album. The indie-friendly mergers Diplo brokers in their place have their moments, but by and large they're no more accessible-- and definitely less complementary-- than their originals.</p>
<p>The most significant connection Diplo makes here isn't between Gucci and casual hip-hop fans. It's between today's various underground styles of woozy, stoner-friendly electronic music. There's glo-fi/chillwave/whatever: Memory Tapes gives <i>Burrprint</i>'s gloriously shameless jewelry boast ""Excuse Me"" some icy, extraterrestrial counterpoint (space abhors a bare neck). There's post-dubstep blippiness from Zomby, who adds a different kind of trunk-shuddering low-end to <i>Guccimerica</i> threat ""Boi"". There's also Warp-signed hip-hop instrumentalist Flying Lotus, fogging up 2008's ""Photo Shoot"" with siren wobble and extra mush-mouth. Unfortunately, gloomy lo-fi duo Salem have done much better Gucci remixes than this rotely ominous rework of another <i>Burrprint</i> highlight, ""My Shadow"". Overall, though, <i>Free Diplo</i> shows that some of the most notable home electronic producers right now have more in common than their fan factions might like to admit.</p>
<p>The link between Gucci's intoxicated flow and Diplo's chosen remixers should be obvious, but bringing them together isn't always so seamless. French producer Douster puts post-""A Milli"" bass mumbles beneath <i>Burrprint</i>'s (relatively) introspective ""Frowney Face"". OK-- but why did Philly's Emynd think his uptempo version of the same track needed irritating percolator bubbles? DJ Teenwolf, of Brooklyn's Ninjasonik, bur(r)ies <i>Great BRRitain</i>'s ""I'm Expecting"" (""What you expect? I expect another check, man"") in constantly hammering kick drums and skidding sound effects. The same mixtape's ""I Be Everywhere"" gets an Asian motif and pitch-shifting from English producer Mumdance on one fairly solid remix, then burbling dubstep clichés from San Francisco's DZ on another. Austin's Bird Peterson replaces the mock-gothic sweep of one more <i>Burrprint</i> cut, ""Dope Boys"", with expansively conceived bass-synth grandeur that should please fans of Memory Tapes; still, it's an odd fit for such a playful song (""I'm paraplegic/ Where's my paralegal?""). Anyone reading this review can get a better sense of Gucci's weird charms by going straight to the source. Which you can download almost as easily.</p>
<p>As for Diplo himself, the Mad Decent boss can take credit for a few of the mixtape's better tracks-- especially a stomping, synth-slithering ""Excuse Me"" (""He do all that lame stuff/ I just keep it gangsta"") that wouldn't be too far out of place on one of Gucci's own albums. Snares bustle and synths bend on Diplo's ""Break Yourself"", a much fuller production than the <i>Burr Russia</i> original. His Mariah Carey-sampling remix of <i>Guccimerica</i>'s outlaw manifesto ""Dangers Not a Stranger"", with its satin-y keys, might be too precious for some, but it-- like DJ Benzi and Willy Joy's Daniel Bedingfield-sampling trance-rap take on 2008's ""I'm the Shit""-- uncovers enjoyably unexpected similarities between otherwise vastly different tracks.</p>
<p>So <i>Free Gucci</i> isn't great. But even a mixtape without any duds would arrive at a time when Diplo's target audience no longer needs someone like Diplo to help them meet rap halfway. Washed Out, whose gauzy synth-pop isn't included here but shares the same spirit, came to his current sound after working on instrumental hip-hop tracks. Salem have been informed by chopped'n'screwed music since the beginning, and their remix of Jeezy diss ""Round One"" beats anything here, easy. Newest Warp signee Babe Rainbow, aka Vancouver-based producer Cameron Reed, calls his style ""surf-step"": lo-fi beach-punk goes dubstep? Reed is also a huge hip-hop fan. Diplo need not be afraid of the merge, but <i>Free Gucci</i> is too little, too late.</p></div>"|13845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13845-diplo-presents-free-gucci-best-of-the-cold-war-mixtapes/|5.9|Marc Hogan

It's dance music overloaded with bubblegum divas and post-rave special effects created in an era when ""minimal"" has become a goddamned <i>genre</i>. (Lady Gaga can sell bubblegum diva and post-rave special effects as pop but she has personality-driven media appeal and brutally obvious songwriting.) But while they've continued to give subtlety the finger, the Jaxx have tightened up in recent years, doubling down on their hooks while clearing away the sonic clutter. For instance: 2009's streamlined <i>Scars</i> was originally meant to be a double album; <i>Zephyr</i>-- 33 minutes of synth washes, ethnographic pastiches, and soft-rock jams-- is the heretofore assumed scrapped second disc.</p>
<p><i>Zephyr</i> may seem slight, but, in theory if not practice, it affirms that Basement Jaxx refuse to limit themselves, and <i>that's</i> their main gift to 21st century dance music. Which is kinda perverse when you consider <i>Zephyr</i> could be sold as the Jaxx's ""downtempo"" album, a genre that all but prides itself on ruthlessly enforcing its well-known limits. On my first listen to <i>Zephyr</i>, I thought: <i>This is the most antic ""ambient"" album of all time.</i> On the second I was reminded of one of those Sublime Frequencies comps where a jackleg ethnographer recorded a few days' worth of indigenous radio, collaging the results together. Call it <i>Radio South London 2009</i>, maybe: The Jaxx have taken the borderless wash of sound around them-- on the airwaves and in the market stalls-- and given it a new coat of Jaxx-ian glitz. Whether it's moody balearic guitar (""Peace of Mind"") or ersatz Middle Eastern soundtrack music (""Alkazaar""), the Jaxx have infused sounds both currently hip and perennially winning with their usual wit and flash.</p>
<p>But since when would Basement Jaxx be content with seamlessly recreating, well, <i>anything</i>? If the Jaxx are anything, they're inveterate <i>mixers</i>, DJs to the core. The best bits of <i>Zephyr</i> gently slip between genres in a manner that recalls a hyper-pop version of the KLF's somnambulent <i>Chill Out</i>, a travelogue that plays with time (the history of post-rave dance) rather than distance (the dreamed wide open spaces of the U.S.A.). Occasionally the Jaxx seem to be having a playful laugh at both downtempo's conventions, and their own. ""Check the Fuse"" makes a minute of hoary cocktail piano cheese come to Technicolor life through loony digital processing, while final track ""Ascension"" tries to squeeze in all of the Jaxx's late-90s obsessions (Latin jazz, ragga dancehall, the girliest bits of girly house).</p>
<p><i>Zephyr</i> is certainly chock full of Jaxx trademarks, but releasing it as a stand-alone maxi-EP, an experimental curio, means no one will mistake it for the sixth Basement Jaxx album. In a weird way I wish it <i>was</i>, though, because it'd earn the appropriate amount of attention due the last curveball the Jaxx had to throw at fans: a subtle, damn-near-chilled-out record after a decade-plus of OTT-as-aesthetic strategy. It'll be even funnier if it manages to divide fans as well as foes.</p></div>"|13857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13857-zephyr-ep/|7.0|Jess Harvell

That claim's a little high-flown, but then it suits Phil Elverum, who as the Microphones and now Mount Eerie has made an art of turning the grandiose intimate, and introspective and fleeting moments into something universal and grand. The six-track <i>Black Wooden </i>EP marks Mount Eerie's contribution to the series, joining previous releases from fellow leftfield indie luminaries such as Ariel Pink, Sir Richard Bishop, Circle, Magik Markers, and Bohren und der Club of Gore. The premise: set the artist in question up at London's famed Southern Studios-- where <i>Psychocandy</i> was laid to tape, and where Sonic Youth, PJ Harvey, Crass, and Fugazi, among others, have recorded-- and invite them to craft ""something spontaneous, collaborative, fun, or experimental.""</p>
<p>""Spontaneity"" is the operative word with <i>Black Wooden</i>. Elverum made these recordings while on tour in summer 2007 (reportedly with a borrowed guitar, no less), and they effectively function as a snapshot of the State of Mount Eerie in the later years of the last decade. Tone-setting opener and title track ""Black Wooden"", on which Elverum spreads spare, ominous natural imagery over a steady strummed pulse, alludes directly to the man's abandoned exercise in inventing a new genre. (""Black wooden,"" a more ""organic"" variant of black metal-- though by <i>Wind's Poem</i> Elverum had seemingly given up trying to make the distinction.)</p>
<p>""Appetite"" would soon find a home on said experiment's resulting <i>Black Wooden Ceiling Opening</i> EP, albeit buffed up with some of the most ferocious riffage we'd yet heard from Elverum. On that recording the line ""constantly waking up to obliteration"" cues a monsoon of crashing guitars; here, however, Elverum pauses for a beat, inhales, and simply continues with the next line. That the song keeps its solemn momentum is, in a way, heavier than any six-string thundering. ""If We Knew"" and ""Oh My Heart"" (here known as ""Marriage"", with a partial lyrics sheet makeover) reappear on <i>Lost Wisdom</i>, Elverum's 2008 record with Julie Doiron and Fred Squire. It's interesting to hear Elverum sing the former tune, in particular. The <i>Lost</i> version has Doiron harmonizing with herself, while Elverum's <i>Black Wooden</i> take has him, as ever, sounding like the patron saint of solitude--appropriate for a song clearly born out of the stuff.</p>
<p>Speaking of solitude, listening to the <i>Black Wooden</i> EP, as with <i>Lost Wisdom</i>, feels like taking in your own private Mount Eerie concert, complete with the pin-drop-audible reverent background hushed-ness that Elverum's gigs tend to inspire. And while most of the record is admittedly about as humorous as the Latitude series tagline, it's not entirely bone-dry: ""The Bottomless Pit"" has Elverum following the typical navel-gazery of ""Letting it all go, taking it all in/ Which way should I live out my short life?"" with ""meanwhile it all yawns indifferently,"" about as amusing a moment of jokey self-awareness we're liable to get from this guy. And hey, we'll take it.</p>
<p>Verdict-wise, it goes something like this: If you're a big-time fan and you bought the super fancy photo book and the singles and the journal, you probably have <i>Black Wooden</i> already. If you've got the collector's itch and phrases like ""limited edition,"" ""never-to-be repeated,"" and ""artisan sleeve motif and insert"" get you giddy, you're definitely in the target demo. And heck, even if you're but an aspiring convert who's reluctant to make a huge commitment, as a welcome mat to the realm of Mount Eerie, you could do much worse.</p></div>"|13829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13829-black-wooden-ep/|7.0|Matthew Solarski

A national treasure in Zaire (he was to the former Belgian Congo roughly twice what Springsteen is to Jersey), he lived in Paris for a good deal of the 1980s, as he fell in and out of favor with Zaire's dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. His group Tout Puissant (""The Almighty"") OK Jazz-- a dance band, not a jazz band-- had one cluster of members based in Brussels, another back home in Kinshasa. They marked their 25th anniversary with a series of four albums, and followed that up with a ""just like old times"" collaboration with their former singer Sam Mangwana, then a ""we're buddies despite our differences"" collaboration with Franco's longtime professional rival Tabu Ley Rochereau.</p>
<p>That all sounds like a recipe for tepid cash-ins, right? But this 2xCD sequel to the first Sterns anthology of Franco's recordings (which covered 1953-1980) is thunderbolts and fireworks, start to finish. Maybe it's just canny song selection by compiler/annotator Ken Braun, who boiled down the dozens of albums Franco released in the 1980s to these 13 songs, but it sure sounds like the final quarter of TPOK's career was its best, which would make them close to unique in pop history.</p>
<p>That may be because they operated on a different model from most bands. Franco was the guy who ran the show, and a superb musician (his chiming, flickering guitar parts defined soukous as much as Jimmy Nolen's defined funk), but he was only one of many guitarists in the group, one of many songwriters, and one of many singers (far from the smoothest). The band needed Franco-- they imploded after his 1989 death, at 51, of what nobody's quite willing to say for sure was AIDS-related causes-- but they were a lot more than just sidemen. ""Tokomo Ba Camarade Pamba"", the glorious opener here, flutters along Francolessly for its first couple of minutes, stacking up interlocking guitar figures and sinuous vocal harmonies; then the boss's gruff voice lurches into the mix a second before the horns kick in and the whole thing achieves liftoff.</p>
<p>The excellence of '80s TPOK Jazz also had a lot to do with the band's shift, a few years earlier, from 45s to LPs. Soukous songs are meant to stretch out: the <i>sebene</i> that was a feature of a lot of Franco's best numbers is less a jam or a rave-up than a good bit that goes on for a while with limited variation. Of the 13 tracks on these two discs, only three are under 10 minutes long. ""Bina Na Ngai Na Respect"", written and sung by Ntesa Dalienst, is a brief, stately stroll followed by 15 minutes of spark-spitting dance-floor blowout. 1985's ""Mario"", arguably Franco's greatest hit, is an all-<i>sebene</i> hipshaker on which he and Madilu Bialu sing in the character of a widow with a moocher for a boyfriend-- its functional Anglophone equivalents are probably UTFO's ""Roxanne, Roxanne"" (who might they be talking trash about?) and the Velvet Underground's ""What Goes On"" (just keep playing that riff forever, please).</p>
<p>Mostly, though, the late-period work collected here is a joy because Franco was perpetually pushing his band toward the future, almost always with excellent results. (The embarrassingly dated synth-drums on ""Pesa Position Na Yo"" are a rare exception.) These songs are formally riskier than most musicians with a catalog as successful as his would ever dare, and there's a wonderfully mischievous streak to them. The prettiness of TPOK Jazz's records was often threaded with rage and indignation, and the last couple of songs here understandably address mortality face-on, but even in his darkest moments Franco treated moving the crowd as a sweet responsibility.</p></div>"|13820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13820-francophonic-vol-2-1980-1989/|8.7|Douglas Wolk

Just as vendors of big-screen HD televisions bank images that bristle with detail-- rustling fields of crimson poppies, sparkling seascapes-- sellers of hi-fi systems could use Monolake's sub-bass throb and pin-prick highs to show off their painstakingly engineered products. The Berlin musician's work has always been attuned to shiveringly precise sonics, but <i>Silence</i> represents a new pinnacle of sound as full-spectrum embrace. (Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Monolake's <a href=""http://www.monolake.de/releases/ml-025.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">production notes</a> emphasize that the album was recorded and mastered without compression, making this a welcome counter-offensive in the ""loudness wars."") That's not to say that this is merely music for hi-fi nerds. Blending elements of techno, dubstep, and ambient into an hour of suggestive, idiosyncratic drift, <i>Silence</i> presents programmed electronic music at its most sensually expressive.</p>
<p>Monolake knows his way around sound design, of course. Also known as Robert Henke, he was one of the original developers of Ableton Live, the popular performance and production software, making him not only something of a legend, but also a rarity: very few figures have achieved a similar degree of success in both recording and instrument design. To give you an idea of his impact, imagine a latter-day Robert Moog or Tom Oberheim, but with a discography as deep as his list of patents. (Monolake is actually a shifting, collaborative project; it began as a duo of Henke and fellow Ableton co-founder Gerhard Behles, who later left the group; since the mid-2000s, Monolake has occasionally comprised Henke and Torsten Pröfrock, aka T++. <i>Silence</i>, however, is credited as a solo Henke production.)</p>
<p>Ableton Live takes a fair amount of flak on producers' forums for delivering sound quality allegedly inferior to that of Logic Pro-- a claim that I've never seen substantiated. In any case, <i>Silence</i>, which was composed, edited, and mixed entirely in Live, offers ample evidence to the contrary. I can't think of a single piece of contemporary electronic music that sounds fuller, richer, or more nuanced. But this also isn't ""pure"" computer music; according to Henke's production notes, along with its synthesized sounds the album incorporates a wide range of real-world sonics-- metal percussion, dripping water, architectural acoustics, and all manner of field recordings-- that place it in a long tradition of <i>musique concrète</i>. This isn't an academic distinction; it's that openness to the world of sound that gives <i>Silence</i> such immersive depth.</p>
<p>Crucial to the success of the album is the way that Henke blurs the line between the sampled and the synthetic. One of the album's central elements is a recurring sound like mallets bouncing on metal cable-- whether it's ""real"" or ""artificial"" I don't know, or care-- whose fluid, regular/irregular bounce lends a delicious gravity. They might be the record's most radical achievement, counterbalancing techno's rigidity with rippling, quicksilver grace. In essence, these patterns translate Henke's interest in granular sound to the realm of rhythm: over and over, textures become patterns and vice versa. <i>Silence</i> is a masterful exploration of the vagaries of scale, one that-- quite unlike your HD plasma screen-- rewards equally whether witnessed close up, far away, or deep inside.</p></div>"|13855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13855-silence/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

So what exactly does that mean these days? Often, it's a reference to either a display of astounding technical chops or innovative use of tone and texture, qualities which, to be quite honest, aren't particularly present here. This is a great guitar album in the way Weezer's Blue Album, Built to Spill's <i>Keep It Like a Secret</i>, or, more recently, Japandroids' <i>Post-Nothing</i> are: six-strings serve as a multiplier for hooks, making it every bit as easy and fun to air guitar with as it is to sing along to.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more true than on their breakout single ""Swim"", which spent the second half of last year generating so much praise that it threatened to make any future album unnecessary or future hype redundant. But even after so many listens, its snowblind-ish reverb is still disorienting-- especially contrasted with its crisp, power-chord hook. It may sound like they're hitting you with their best shot, but after an impassioned ""oh oh oh!"" from singer John Paul Pitts, Surfer Blood explodes into an even <i>bigger </i>chorus and ""Swim"" becomes almost overpoweringly fist-pumping.</p>
<p>While ""Swim"" might just remind you of any number of Buzz Bin one-offs now stocking whatever's left of the used-CD store racket, <i>Astro Coast </i>has a strong supporting cast. Throughout, even the titles remark upon how each could've evolved from a killer guitar part into a full-on song-- ""Floating Vibes"", ""Harmonix"", ""Neighbour Riffs"". ""Floating Vibes"" lumbers with a chest-puffing, two-chord stomp that could evoke either Angus Young or Stephen Malkmus, before the guitars dovetail-- one chiming and light, the other a vocal-leading riff that makes Pitts' handling of the melodic contours sound effortless. The melodic intuitiveness of <i>Astro Coast </i>is in large part due to the interplay heard on ""Floating Vibes""-- if every riff is stand-alone hummable, then the vocals take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Surfer Blood know from a good hook, but perhaps what's more promising is how most of their compositions build to their rewards. ""Take It Easy"" does the opposite at its outset, but by its midpoint the fidgety rhythms cool to a mesmerizing motorik that's continued on ""Harmonix"". ""Slow Jabroni"" is lonesome and crowded, distorted acoustics serving as a dusty backdrop for Pitts' Isaac Brock-ian carny barking. The riff that introduces ""Anchorage"" is as blunt as its sentiments (""I don't want to spin my wheels/ I don't got no wheels to spin""), but its second half unfurls a major-key riff that evokes the roomier compositions of Dinosaur Jr. Putting the record's two longest songs back-to-back might not be the canniest bit of sequencing, but it shows the confidence Surfer Blood have in their ability to escape the confines of three-minute power-pop.</p>
<p>Though they hail from West Palm Beach and come at the tail-end of 2009's indie feel-good beach party, for all of the oceanic imagery that the band name, album title, and cover art convey, <i>Astro Coast </i>is lyrically landlocked and lonely. Pitts is straightforward when he's not being shrouded by the springy reverb favored by the Shins' James Mercer, and at points, he reads pointedly early-00s emo. Topics of concern include confusion about romance, confusion about friendship, confusion about the future, confusion about religion. It's hard not to think that most of <i>Astro Coast </i>was borne of a relationship dissolved by distance, especially if we're to take the otherwise chipper ""Twin Peaks"" at face value: Pitts travels to Syracuse, watches David Lynch films, and wrenches out lyrics of sexual frustration that suggest most of the drive was spent listening to <i>Pinkerton.</i></p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Surfer Blood spent the latter part of 2009 touring with Japandroids, who, along with BOAT and Cymbals Eat Guitars align in a faux-genre some of us have jokingly referred to as ""alt-bro""-- guitar-heavy indie rock that's probably influenced by Pavement, likely about girls, and almost certainly made by people who at first blush sound more fun to get a beer with than, say, Dirty Projectors. But it's unfair to think of <i>Astro Coast </i>as reactionary in some way to the more overtly ambitious indie stars of last year-- there are no chamber sections, no pocket harmonies, no integration of West African rhythms (ok, there's <i>some </i>of that). But ambition can just as easily manifest itself as a desire to create a relentlessly catchy, ""classic indie"" album in your own dorm room, and if that's what Surfer Blood set out to do, <i>Astro Coast </i>succeeds wildly.</p></div>"|13844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13844-astro-coast/|8.2|Ian Cohen

Over the course of eight studio albums as Eels, Everett has made a career of feeling sorry for himself in some capacity-- typically, these misanthropic leanings have been juxtaposed against childlike flits of whimsy or coffee-black observations of varying degrees of wit. He was, for the most part, never humorless; he was gratingly self-referential and bogged-down by the Leonard Cohen-as-Eeyore thing he does. <i>End Times</i> does the sadness without the humor. Everett has described the album as a reaction to ""the state of the desperate times we live in,"" and it chronicles a very personal break-up through a prism of a collective hard times. It is by all accounts a break-up album, but one that's plodding, boring, and full of icky self-pity. ""Now I'm a statistic, but I'm not fatalistic,"" Everett's sings on ""In My Younger Days"", ""I'm not yet resigned to fate."" Like on much of <i>End Times</i>, the guy couldn't be further off-base.</p>
<p>It starts with ""The Beginning"", a disparate picture of a down-on-their-luck couple that still views the world as ""beautiful and free."" A foreboding chronicle of the unpleasantness to follow, the typical arc of a break-up tale never materializes as ""The Beginning"" promises. Instead, the remainder of the record refuses to delve into any emotion more complex than pity or self-doubt (save for ""Unhinged"", the only moment where Everett takes a break from blaming himself and musters the courage to call his lover ""crazy""), until we arrive at ""On My Feet"", which really requires no further explanation. This isn't to say you don't kind of feel for the guy-- after all, you'd have to endure some seriously damaging emotional stuff to want to drag your fans through 40 minutes of it as well--especially without any real emotional payout.</p>
<p>Somehow, this makes the outlying ""end of times"" correlation even more disingenuous. At its least intrusive, it just feels tacked-on: ""Gone Man"", a rare mid-tempo bid here, effuses like it's drinking to forget, but ultimately finds Everett mulling over every misstep. When there does seem to be something to say about the breakdown (not just the break-up), it comes off even cheaper. ""Paradise Blues"" finds Everett back in tongue-in-cheek mode, but it blows up in his face so spectacularly, it's pure contrivance. Eventually, Everett's disassociation with himself results in a disassociation with the music, as each painfully plain entry becomes simply exhaustively dull. By the end, he's left singing to the ""only friend [he] has in the world,"" the little bird on the back porch-- just in case you were wondering how sucky this thing could truly get.</p></div>"|13835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13835-end-times/|3.9|Zach Kelly

How good that sounded for a couple minutes? They'd roll out these big, beautiful kaleidoscopic ads before movies sometimes, swarming strawberries in stereo, and you'd look down at your Cherry Coke and feel somehow as though you'd failed. Of course, in the lobby's light, you came to find out that Fruitopia was not in fact made by hippies using ecologically sound methods for growing giant fruit, but rather extracted and besaccharined by the very Coca-Cola corporation that had seemed like the source of so much pancreas-punching horror not moments before. Fruitopia was, in a way, more evil than your simple soda; evil, because it tricked you into believing it was good when it wasn't.</p>
<p>Remember Ima Robot? Ima Robot were one of those bandwagon-hopping jerk-punk bands that emerged around 2003 to capitalize on the burgeoning jerk-punk moment; there were many, alas. As nicely zeitgeisty as their leadoff single ""Dynomite"" was, there was always something weirdly disingenuous about Ima Robot-- that they were basically Beck's then-current backing band led by some shouty haircut probably had something to do with it-- but they came and went so fast it was hard to find the time to care. They weren't evil, but they weren't missed.</p>
<p>Just as you'd feel a little funny if some hippie ideals were being espoused to sell you fancy Kool-Aid, you'd feel a little funny if a jerk-punker-- and I hesitate to say failed, but, yeah, failed jerk-punker-- reemerged a couple of years on as some kind of robe-donning, beard-rocking guru sort, wouldn't you? Well, get ready: Ima Robot lead singer Alex Ebert has reeimagined himself in the image of messiah-type Edward Sharpe. Gone is the lanky, nervy guy sticking an exclamation mark at the end of every thought; this Sharpe character's a real laid-back, lovey-dovey dude, one with his head very much in the clouds. But even he seems onto this dichotomy between the free-spirited music on <i>Up From Below</i>, his and the Magnetic Zeros' first one together, and the slightly disingenuous feel of it all. ""It's the magical mystery kind,"" he opines on opener ""40 Day Dream"", before adding another qualifier: ""must be a lie."" Indeed!</p>
<p>Sharpe and his Zeros dip their many toes into the, um, ""sounds of the 1960s""; there's some Cowsills-like froth, Friends of Distinction multipart ooby-doobies, some Donovan-style slowpoke revelry, and even a little dour <i>Village Green</i>-era Kinks drollery. But the admirably far-reaching results nevertheless come up short. There's handclaps and horns, sprightly choruses and thousand-part harmonies to go around, but all the fluff either seems appliqued onto the song as an afterthought or the only real thought the song's got. A carefully curated list of influences abound, but no matter who they're reminding you of, Sharpe and company are careful not to outdo anything that's preceded them in energy or inspiration or both. It's oddly uptight, heavily studied music, too-- never once approaching anything like ""looseness."" Lyrically, it's a lot of love-your-fellow-man stuff that doesn't exactly pass for insight sitting next to some kinda gnarly Jamie Stewart childhood trauma. It's as if Sharpe's got his arms open so wide, he's never going to reach anybody. And all the weird juxtapositions and half-formed ideas in tandem on <i>Up From Below</i> lend it a repurposed feel, like Sharpe-- pardon me, Ebert-- had the songs and figured, with 11 musicians on hand he'd find something for them to do.</p>
<p>But then there's ""Home"", a jaunty duet between Sharpe and ladyfriend/bandmate Jade Castrinos. It's the one moment that justifies <i>Up From Below</i>'s existence. Sure, it calls to mind another fairly different classic sound of the 60s-- Johnny and June Carter Cash's conversational duets-- but, thanks in no small part to Castrinos' whiskey-splashed pipes, it feels glaringly original amidst the daisy chain surrounding it, an obvious affection passing between Sharpe and Castrinos as they murmur sweet nothings. Weird to say about a hippie, but it's humanity that's missing in Sharpe's mild but mannered and certainly unmemorable music, which feels focus-grouped, stone-washed, and artificial.</p></div>"|13852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13852-up-from-below/|4.1|Paul Thompson

What may have sounded arch or in-jokey before (and may have even been intended that way) now sounds more like the band has been planting flags and protecting the sometimes contradictory strains of rock they grew up with. That seemingly at-odds musical mix-- between 1970s rock cliché and 80s synth-rock cliché, icy electronics and analog sweat, musical discipline and wild indulgence-- sounds now almost like a masterplan.</p>
<p>One reason these instrumentals still hold up is that there was always rock-solid musicianship behind them. Therefore, a live record suits them pretty well. On both the record and included DVD, it's immediately apparent Trans Am have the chops to pull off and maintain the pastiche. But unlike some of the artists they've lovingly sent up and/or paid homage to in their own music, that ability is pointed toward building tension and establishing surprise. It's evident all over <i>What Day Is it Tonight?</i>: From the extended drum fill at the start of ""Futureworld"" to its steadfast Krautrock-derived core to its fake-out closing minutes, many of the band's contrasts and idiosyncrasies can be located in that one track. Earlier songs like ""Firepoker"" build tension through manic stops and starts only to dissolve into one great John Carpenter-worthy synth drone.</p>
<p>The tracklist culls from the band's entire career, and though it cherrypicks tracks from several different live performances, it flows smoothly.  Many songs from their later albums shine in this setting: A stripped-down ""Positive People"" gets reclaimed as a worthy deep cut from the tongue-maybe-too-firmly-in-cheek <i>TA</i>, while<i> Futureworld</i> material like '""Television Eyes"" sounds that much more visceral.</p>
<p>Trans Am are just as good at what they do now as they've ever been-- in fact, they've grown more subtle and sophisticated by now (if you can reach such a bar with homages to camp and cliché). But in hearing old against new on <i>What Day Is it Tonight?</i>, some of their most recent work sounds clinical by comparison. '""First Words"" (from 2007's <i>Sex Change</i>) finds a sturdy groove and has even better texture and open space, but it can't help but feel like a come down after the faster material. While it's somewhat difficult to reconcile their whole career in one live disc, the material remains unpredictable even as it gets a little more cerebral. For those who had even a passing interest in Trans Am's music over the years, this set is a fine reminder of why you likely tuned into them in the first place.</p></div>"|13788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13788-what-day-is-it-tonight/|7.2|Jason Crock

Its relentless squall-- rapidfire drums, riff-and-raze guitars, and back-and-forth electric bass, plus the serrated screams of co-founder Mick Barr-- could appeal to devotees of classic black metal bands Burzum, Immortal, and Emperor. The distended shapes Krallice's pummel takes might work for fans of U.S. black metal marathon men Wolves in the Throne Room. Or for those who get lost in the massed guitar works of Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca or in the overtone hysteria of composers like La Monte Young, ""Untitled"" flits around one note. Darkly radiant and completely mesmerizing, those eight minutes of drumless glow feel like a musical cocoon, an alternate version of Barr's work on Orthrelm's <i>OV</i>. And for noiseniks, there are harsh, finessed impasses, too, like the prelude to ""Aridity"", where feedback and split octaves howl and groan.</p>
<p>What's more, Barr and Colin Martson (Dysrhythmia, Behold... the Arctopus), comprise a fairly infallible guitar duo. Their playing here is as complex as it is controlled and deliberate. Sidewinding riffs and rapidfire progressions scream above the dense rhythm section. <i>Dimensional Bleedthrough</i>'s seven pieces twist and halt, lurch and sprint, shifting rhythms and directions without warning. It seems like a shoo-in as a new favorite for prog and math-rock zealots. And, for those living for death metal, there's ""The Mountain"". At three minutes and 14 seconds, it's the album's shortest track by nearly a third and its most direct by a mile. Bassist Nick McMaster takes the vocals this time, spitting the words above a brutal churn, his deep, irascible bellow recalling Suffocation and Cryptopsy.</p>
<p>Whereas Krallice thrive at a rarified intersection of death and black metal, noise abandon and prog precision, pedestrian grit and academic commitment, it seems a lot of listeners might be afraid-- or too territorial-- to follow. At times, it seems too mathematical for metal kids, too tough for the avant-garde set, and too oriented for the noise dudes. It eschews those pretty passages that have long been Wolves in the Throne Room's popular bait, and it's certainly not setting out to terrify, either.</p>
<p>Forget all of that, though, and keep listening-- closely. <i>Dimensional Bleedthrough</i> isn't and doesn't aim to be a headphones masterpiece. Its 77 minutes are almost uniformly brutal, and digesting it at such close proximity is bound to fatigue. But it is arranged and engineered to offer more than the benchmarks of second-wave black metal, or even the shock-and-tone tactics of a lot of noise and industrial acts. Notice the way the guitars pull against each other within the first two minutes of the splendid title track, tugging each other through the riff's hairpin turns, or how one guitar veers into a skuzzy, distorted counter to introduce Barr's vocals nearly four minutes in. Or listen for the way the progression of ""Autochton"" slides with Barr's growled glissando, especially in the first minute. It's those details-- and, of course, Krallice's gargantuan sound-- that make <i>Dimensional Bleedthrough</i> bigger and better than most other metal hybrids around.</p></div>"|13840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13840-dimensional-bleedthrough/|8.0|Grayson Currin

Between his brilliant but impractical 2008 long-player <i>Where You Go I Go Too</i> and his 42-minute refit of ""Little Drummer Boy"", two of the Norwegian producer's recent major releases have accounted for nearly 100 minutes of music across a scant four tracks. In a scene where an elongated 12-minute remix is par for the course, that's still hard going.</p>
<p><i>Real Life Is No Cool</i> isn't just the achingly stylish and neatly accessible dance record to end all that, it also constitutes a fresh new take on the strand of retro-futurism that Lindstrøm helped create. The main difference is that whereas a lot of his output has been rooted in a genre-- disco, Balearic, new age-- <i>Real Life Is No Cool</i> often feels more like an attack on the very idea. It's almost as if Lindstrøm's response to years of genre exercise has been to atomise all of his influences into mist. What remains is a free-floating collection of sounds that not only still works as pastiche, but also somehow provides the basis for a remarkable dance record.</p>
<p>Of course, it might well be that the reason Lindstrøm finds it easier to play loose with his productions is because he's got a voice like Christabelle's to anchor them. A Norwegian with Mauritian roots, she slides effortlessly into pretty much any groove he provides, moving between slippery spoken word and breathy falsetto with equal ease. Evidently years in the making, <i>Real Life Is No Cool</i> functions partly as a chronicle of the pair's working relationship, spanning as far back as 2003, when she was still recording under the name Solale. While those early collaborations, including the slinky Italo of ""Music (In My Mind)"" and the fluttering space disco workout ""Let's Practise"", make repeat appearances here, they barely hold their own alongside most of the newer material.</p>
<p>Of the fresher tracks, the most immediate are probably ""So Much Fun"", a scattershot slice of end-of-the-evening disco that rivals Scissor Sisters at their friskiest; ""Baby Can't Stop"", an unequivocally shameless tribute to <i>Off the Wall</i>-era Michael Jackson that deserves airplay in even spite of Aeroplane's original-dwarfing remix; and ""Lovesick"", an irresistibly slinky head-nodder. Ultimately though, it's the slightly more unstructured, harder to hold tracks that make the most lasting impressions. Album opener ""Looking For What"" surfs along on a wobbly arpeggio, an occasional guitar chug, diffuse piano chords, and spoken-word samples; the stunning ""Keep It Up"" manages to transform a distinctly cheesy retro synth chime into a thing of effortless gorgeousness; and ""High &amp; Low"" starts with a stodgy 1980s sitcom theme vamp before melting into something deliriously woozy. <span> </span>If the man and his long songs have been off your mixtape radar for the last little while, this should see an end to that.</p></div>"|13848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13848-real-life-is-no-cool/|8.1|Mark Pytlik

Some consider its forbidding runtime a byproduct of Judd Apatow's success and/or ego, others proof that his deep and genuine love for stand-up comedy inspired him to go all out to create its<i> </i>definitive film experience. I'm inclined to think the latter, since if you share Apatow's obsession with the artform, there were just tons of inside jokes, Easter eggs, and knowing winks that made those two and a half hours pass a little more quickly. Perhaps the most notable was that of RAAAAAAAANDY, the scene-stealing, blowjob-obsessed shock comic played by Aziz Ansari. Many wondered who exactly he was supposed to ""be""-- Ansari says it's an amalgamation, and judging from the nine-minute, in-character bonus track on his debut record, <i>Intimate Moments For a Sensual Evening</i>, it's a comedy Cerberus of Dice Clay/Funk Flex/DJ Khaled. But the funniest joke was how the casting threw people off the scent: here's the embodiment of crude, backwards-hat humor being played by a slight, fully-bearded Indian guy from South Carolina, best known for offbeat comedies like ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""Human Giant"".</p>
<p>Then again, this undersells the kind of crossover appeal Ansari brings to his record.<i> </i>Though ""Human Giant"" was the kind of sketch show that would book the National as musical guests, as Ansari relates here on ""MTV's Next"", they also tried to find ways to shoehorn jokes about getting raped by dinosaurs. Much is made of Ansari's ties to indie rock, but in the span of one bit, you'll hear ""TV on the Radio"" and ""titties."" (Obviously, it's one of the two about Kanye West.) It's a tough gig to bridge the alternative scene at Upright Citizens Brigade and the business card swap meets at the Improv, but if there was a stand-up equivalent to the indie crossover of Phoenix's crowd-pleasing <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</i>, this might be it.</p>
<p>In a similar way, it's pop smarts that define Ansari's performance: He's relatable without pandering and clever without making a flex of intellect or being overly arch. Ansari isn't about upsetting convention but in light of his peers, his livewire reading is refreshing if not altogether innovative. The generally shitty nature of the post-election brought out the darkest albums in everyone from Patton Oswalt to Dane Cook. Ansari, however, is more interested in his chubby cousin Harris-- an obsessive viewer of TNT one-hour dramas and eater of Cinnabon. Harris is played as Aziz's foil, but they share the same teenage-like enthusiasm-- a selling point for Ansari's observational humor.</p>
<p>In the album's first bit, Ansari has already brought up gay marriage, Jamba Juice, and the fallibility of the SmartType feature: in terms of contemporary comedy, those may as well be C, G, and D chords. He realizes they're clichés, but the humor comes in the hold and release-- I'll go easy on the spoilers here, but it's clear that Ansari knows what the crowd expects.<i> </i>He realizes we all <i>notice. </i>The idea that <i>Southern Living</i> conducted an investigation into thread counts could've stopped there, but the joke is in the absurdity of his reaction about finding out he'd been shorted 304 threads: ""If that was a drug deal, I would've shot Hotel Luxury Linens in the face! You didn't think I was gonna count that shit, motherfucker?"" Ansari nods to his Southern upbringing when describing the ""Simple Man Cruise"", a chance for Skynyrd fans to go on a luxury liner and rock out to ""Saturday Night Special"". In the hands of a more cynical comic, it's another elitist smackdown of flyover country, but Ansari turns it into a charming riff on Dixie colloquialisms.</p>
<p>Ansari admits that he's able to track people with celebrity crushes on him because ""I do nothing but take naps all day!"" As such, a good portion of <i>Intimate</i> takes place in Ansari's downtime on the Internet-- he hilariously torments Harris on a Facebook study group page, envisions the obituaries after dying in a car wreck while checking his Blackberry, and plays diplomat in a blog war between Kanye West and his naïve cousin Darwish.</p>
<p>But he often saves his best storytelling to relate what it's like to hang out with famous musicians. Granted, most of it is, ""I'm not even supposed to be here,"" and straight-up journalism from an R. Kelly concert could often pass for comedy-- you could make the argument that Kelly's special brand of genius did all the heavy lifting.  But Ansari nails what makes the spectacle so spectacular: Kelly leaving a club because he's convinced he'll never get a better lapdance, and of course, completely unexplained <i>non sequiturs</i> that dot his concerts.</p>
<p>Perhaps the musician Ansari is most closely associated with is Kanye West, and his ""Night Out With Kanye West"" bit once again does so much to capture the tics: Before doing a private show at Kanye's house, Ansari finds the singer alone, sitting on his couch listening to his own album. But earlier in the night, Kanye explains a long absence in the bathroom: ""I was on an important phone call. I wasn't taking a shit."" Between those two examples, he nails what often makes West such an engrossing figure-- a guy with an enormous ego and an incessant need for approval.  It's 2010, and a famous comedian was able to do routines on R. Kelly and Kanye without using ""pee on you"" or ""I'mma let you finish"" jokes. Go see some more stand-up if that doesn't register as cause for celebration.</p></div>"|13832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13832-intimate-moments-for-a-sensual-evening/|8.1|Ian Cohen

Sure, co-founder Mac McCaughan may have his favorites, but it always seemed like he rooted just as hard for acts such as Butterglory and East River Pipe as he did for such heavy hitters as Arcade Fire and Spoon.</p>
<p>McCaughan cites both the Merge covers collection <i>Score!</i> and the occasional acoustic bookstore appearance supporting <i>Our Noise</i> as the inspiration for the recent Portastatic release <i>Make It Sound in Tune</i>, a seven-song EP of Merge act tracks given the Portastatic treatment, but that's just a roundabout way of citing all the hundreds of Merge acts he's supported over the years. ""Obviously, the Merge catalog is full of hundreds-- thousands, actually-- of songs I love, so I picked ones I either knew well or thought I could re-create without defiling too harshly,"" posted McCaughan, modestly. ""It wasn't easy to narrow down, so I just tried not to think about it too much.""</p>
<p>True to his loyal instincts, the seven songs McCaughan picked to cover run the Merge gamut, from the obvious (Spoon and Magnetic Fields) to the unsung (Matt Suggs and Spent) to the cultish (Lambchop and Destroyer) to one song from Christchurch's Renderers, its source a one-off 7"" from 1993. Also true to his word, none of these covers defile the original. Rather, they do the acts and the Merge catalog proud, underscoring the countless numbers of gems and minor classics the label has curated alongside its conspicuous heavy hitters.</p>
<p>It is interesting how easily McCaughan adopts, adapts, and otherwise sublimates such distinct songwriter personalities as Britt Daniel, Stephin Merritt, Kurt Wagner, and Dan Bejar. Admittedly, ""Anything You Want"" is one of Spoon's more straightforward songs, but McCaughan's version replaces the bright production with rougher lo-fi edges without ruining its tunefulness. The version of ""Old Orchard Beach"", from the Susan Anway-era of the Magnetic Fields (which also produced ""100,000 Fireflies"", a song that Superchunk liked to cover), is supported by Merritt's old-school allegiance to popular song structure, which McCaughan exploits with bits of strings, sax, processed vocals, and echoing drums. The more eccentric Wagner and Bejar port over just as well, the former's ""The Saturday Option"" (from <i>What Another Man Spills</i>) surviving the transition from Wagner's rumble to Mac's yelp, and the innate melodrama of the latter's ""Foam Hands"" subverted by the addition of a charming children's choir.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to McCaughan's enduring feelings for the less obvious corners of the Merge catalog. Matt Suggs never broke through as some predicted, but the version of his ""Where's Your Patience, Dear?"" from 2000's <i>Golden Days Before They End</i> is pleasant enough to warrant a return to the original for another shot. Spent's ""West"" is no less lovely, further indication that the New Jersey group got unfairly lost in the shuffle during the mid-90s indie boom. As for the Renderers' ""A Million Lights"", chalk Portastatic's pretty rendition up as another representation of Merge's longtime and somewhat unappreciated support of oft distribution-challenged New Zealand acts.</p>
<p>As McCaughan himself concedes, he could have chosen any number of alternates for the EP, or, for that matter, just kept recording in perpetuity. Twenty years down the line, it's clear the guy doesn't play favorites. This is all music close to his heart, so it's no surprise that this mini trip down memory lane should prove so heartfelt. And if you didn't like the guy's ethic to begin with, all proceeds go to charity. Talk about sharing the love.</p></div>"|13846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13846-make-it-sound-in-tune/|7.2|Joshua Klein

[He] is so normal and functional that he's practically a freak."" Comedians are self-loathers by nature, and Leno is too well adjusted to be funny, the argument follows. While Japanese producer Hiroshi Watanabe shares no notable similarities with Leno, I've always felt kind of the same way about the music Watanabe makes as Kaito-- his take on deep house, which incorporates elements of trance and minimal, is generally so pleasant and optimistic that it almost seems benign.</p>
<p>The more frequent, concrete criticism of Kaito-- who, with clear ties to the oft-maligned 90s trance scene, is something of an anomaly on Kompakt-- it's that he seems to be making the same record over and over. Kaito's breakout was 2002's <i>Special Life</i>, an album that won folks over for its re-imagining of trance as a worthy component of chic modern techno and offered for many a lively alternative to Kompakt's usual stately bounce. Since then, though, Kaito has seemed content resting on his laurels, doing little to tweak or improve upon his signature sound-- a blend of swooshing synths and tightly packed keyboard trills presented in a happy-go-lucky style.</p>
<p>Boasting song titles like ""Rainbow Circles"" and ""The Breath of Spring"", his latest LP, <i>Trust, </i>mostly follows suit, and will disappoint those who'd hoped Kaito would explore different narrative or sonic threads this time around. But wishing an artist will do what you think he should is a fool's errand, and Kaito's confident enough in his chosen approach to make up for a lack of inventiveness with tracks that carry a good amount of punch. On ""Spring"" and ""Nothing Could Be More Peaceful"", he employs breakbeats (something he's done before with success), setting them behind grand keyboard arrangements in such a way that lends depth and a herky-jerky momentum. Roughly 75 minutes long, the record takes a turn for the better around the halfway point when Kaito introduces some much-needed mystery via icy synth lines on the title track. The songs that follow flit between John Hughes-ian M83 instrumentals (""We Are Living Here"") and more classically Kompakt minimal pieces (""It Happens Suddenly"") but ultimately just seem too polite for their own good.</p></div>"|13842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13842-trust/|5.1|Joe Colly

Vocalist Lucinda Chua rarely raises her voice to a volume beyond that of a private conversation, yet her frequently arresting performances here have an air of unusual gravity. This urgency owes largely to the steady undercurrent of quiet turmoil coursing beneath Felix's graceful arrangements, resulting in a number of lovely songs that veritably crackle with confused desires, anxieties, and needling self-doubt.</p>
<p>For this recording Felix are comprised of Chua, who has toured with Stars of the Lid and here contributes piano, cello, and vocals, and fellow multi-instrumentalist Chris Summerlin. Most of the essential instrumental tracks are built as a skillful dialogue between Chua's piano and Summerlin's guitar, but the two also maximize their flexibility in the studio, fleshing out these songs with multi-tracked vocals, subtle percussion, and string arrangements. These instrumental flourishes do more than merely add atmosphere, as throughout these pieces the arrangements closely parallel and amplify the interior dramas depicted in Chua's lyrics. Informed in part by Chua's classical training, the album strikes an airy balance nearby the quieter moments of PJ Harvey's <i>White Chalk</i> and the spare chamber work of Rachel's' <i>Music for Egon Schiele</i>.</p>
<p>Felix have cited the work of Erik Satie as an influence, and this is nowhere more evident than on ""I Wish I Was a Pony"", a piece whose central piano figure seems a direct descendant of Satie's <i>Gymnopédies</i>. This track, particularly when coupled with the following ""Where Is My Dragon?"" also serves as a fine example of Chua's quietly inscrutable lyrical style, as the simple images of ponies and dragons give way to such conclusions as, ""There's a secret you keep and it makes me dance,"" or, ""Everything you lost and everything you found is not worth it."" Whether or not these lines work on the page, in her performances Chua is able to make them sound like messages of great personal importance, communicating with an effortless touch the image of someone who will feel much better once she has gotten her words out and her mental furniture all set back in place.</p>
<p>The album's vague sense of unease comes further into the forefront on ""What I Learned From TV"", where Chua's wry, media-borne list of anxieties are underscored by somber piano chords and scraping, slightly enervating strings. This thread continues on ""Back in Style"" which juxtaposes its David Lynch references with Chua's self-deprecating but still-caustic appraisal of a relationship (""What if I was kinder? What if I was nicer? What if I was not sick to death of you?"")</p>
<p>Virtually every track on <i>You Are the One I Pick</i> showcases Felix's remarkable instinct for knowing when to ramp up their instrumentation and when to hold back. Yet when an album is this carefully arranged, there are also moments when all the fingerprints on a given track become distracting, as when the fanciful ""Ode to the Marlboro Man"" layers Chua's vocals in such a way that it sounds like a number of competing voices volleying around within a single rattled skull. So it is ultimately not too surprising that on many of the album's best tracks (""Waltzing for Weasels"", ""Bernard St."") the duo keep things refreshingly simple, with single strands of piano, guitar, and cello in quiet symmetry, leaving the listener ample room to savor Felix's knotty, enigmatic songcraft.</p></div>"|13637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13637-you-are-the-one-i-pick/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

It's one of the most appealing things about the band, and the sound has made even Britt Daniel's most vulnerable moments seem grounded and forthright. They've turned it all inside-out on <i>Transference</i>, subtly shifting the leading signifiers of Spoon-iness just so for a destabilizing effect. Their go-to trick for the first half of the album is to include bits of sound that abruptly cut off, usually sung phrases that drop entirely out of the mix mid-syllable. This may be aggravating for some listeners, but this counterintuitive move makes sense in context, indicating distraction and tongue-tied indecision. This is a perfect example of the group's genius as a studio band: They get very cerebral in arranging their material, but every clever move is entirely in the service of maximizing physical impact and gut-level response. These are not simply recordings of a top-notch rock quartet playing in a room; this is art built to hit precise emotional marks with an impressive balance of off-the-cuff improvisation and rigid discipline.</p>
<p>Though their previous records have opened with stylish, immediately thrilling numbers like ""Small Stakes"" and ""The Beast and Dragon, Adored"", <i>Transference</i> begins with ""Before Destruction"", a pensive slow-burner that's more of a muted prelude than a flashy entrance. We're knocked off-balance from the beginning, and the next few songs sustain a sense of confusion and disorientation. ""Is Love Forever?"", a jaunty cut that sounds as though Daniel were aiming to write a much dizzier version of Phoenix's ""Listzomania"", bumps right into ""The Mystery Zone"", an excellent late-night groover that hits the same sweet spot as older gems like ""Don't You Evah"" and ""I Turn My Camera On"". When that track ends suddenly, it's like walking right into a wall before ""Who Makes Your Money"" has you wobbling along with Daniel in a concussed haze. The album sobers up as it moves along, and the progression always makes a certain emotional sense, but it's ultimately a big pile-up of unorthodox creative decisions. On first pass, <i>Transference</i> seems a bit off, even somewhat sloppy for a band known for keeping things focused and snappy. However, upon closer listening it becomes obvious that these guys have made a meticulously crafted ""mess"" that conveys the feeling of flailing around and failing in search of meaningful connections.</p>
<p>The name of the album refers to the Freudian concept of unconsciously projecting feelings for one person or thing to another. It's also the term used to describe when a patient develops a romantic attachment to their analyst, mistaking the intimacy of that relationship for actual love. <i>Transference</i> isn't a concept album, but it's not hard to figure out why they might have chosen the title. There's a nagging desperation for ""real"" love at the core of this record, tangled up in a genuine cluelessness about what it is or how it works. ""The Mystery Zone"" finds Daniel theorizing about relationships and unknowable fates like a rambling, semi-coherent drunk, stumbling up to big ideas but trailing off or nodding out before saying anything that makes complete sense. ""Written in Reverse"" seethes with the bitterness of unrequited love, and Daniel's larynx-shredding vocal hits the right note of resentment and resignation as he spits out lines like, ""I wanna show you how I love you, but there's nothing there.""</p>
<p>Even the most stable tracks seem frustrated or tentative. The gorgeous ""Out Go the Lights"" sounds as exhausted as it is lovesick, and the scorching ""Got Nuffin"" confronts neuroses head-on with plucky courage, but also a chugging riff that evokes gut-churning anxiety. It's hardly uncommon for Spoon songs to deal with failed love and thwarted desire, but Daniel has rarely sounded so vulnerable and his feelings have never seemed so unresolved. Some may hear <i>Transference</i> and get the impression that it's an incomplete or uneven work, but its elliptical nature is ultimately the key to its charm. All through the record, Britt Daniel sounds like a guy left hanging by life, waiting around to figure out the answers to all his questions. It wouldn't make sense for him to tell you anything he doesn't know himself.<br/> <br/> Though the band produced the album themselves, half of the songs on <i>Transference</i> are presented in their original ""demo"" form, resulting in unexpected shifts between raw and slick audio textures. Since Daniel and drummer Jim Eno are experienced engineers, almost nothing on the album could rightly be considered lo-fi, but there is a disarming immediacy to these less polished tracks that makes the record as a whole seem very relaxed and informal in comparison to their previous efforts.</p>
<p>""Goodnight Laura"", a straightforward ballad on the album's second side, gains a lot from this approach, with an intimate ""live"" sound that gives the impression that you've accidentally stumbled into a Spoon rehearsal. ""Trouble Comes Running"" has the opposite effect with its dramatic stereo separations, but the low-key feeling of the recording preserves an energy that may have been flattened with a more full production. Both of these tracks could be considered ""minor"" Spoon songs, but they reveal just how high the bar has been set for Daniel and company, and how easily their skill can be taken for granted. Following the creative strides made on their last few Merge releases, the only big surprise on <i>Transference</i> is that they've become willing to let their hair down a bit. It can be a bit of a let down if you come in expecting another blockbuster like <i>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</i>, but something of a revelation if you meet them halfway.</p></div>"|13839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13839-transference/|7.8|Matthew Perpetua

Featuring performances by Charalambides, Flying Saucer Attack, Bardo Pond, and Loren Mazzacane Connors, this lavishly packaged set proved to be a landmark, bringing several different underground streams into confluence. Inspired by ancient Pythagorean principles, each of the artists on <i>Harmony of the Spheres</i> strived to transform the base materials of folk, country blues, ambient, and psych-rock into vehicles for innovative, wholly unique personal expression.</p>
<p>It's never easy to conclusively measure an album's influence-- particularly a boutique collection with a limited initial pressing. But at the very least, it can be said that <i>Harmony of the Spheres</i> has since proven to be uncommonly prescient, as the music contained on its six sides anticipated the direction of many subsequent branches of avant-rock, shadowy folk, and glo-fi. And the album's echoes are certainly in easy evidence on this split album by Portland's Grouper (aka singer-songwriter Liz Harris) and the prolific New Zealand guitarist Roy Montgomery, himself a <i>Harmony of the Spheres</i> alum.</p>
<p>In fact, the echoes are literal on Montgomery's side, as he here presents a lovely live version of his majestic piece ""Fantasia on a Theme by Sandy Bull"", which first appeared on <i>Harmony of the Spheres</i>. But Grouper's songs seem to be direct spiritual descendents as well. Constructed using elemental strands of voice, submerged instruments, and field recordings, Harris' work here is never less than captivating, and a decade and a half later it seems in its own way a perfect distillation of <i>Harmony of the Sphere</i>'s music and guiding principles.</p>
<p>On the original version of ""Fantasia on a Theme by Sandy Bull"", Montgomery took melodic cues from Bull's album <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>, gradually layering his gently strummed chords with multi-tracked effects and overtones to build dense and formidable sheets of sound. For this solo recording, the piece has been necessarily stripped-down, and the loss of the overdubbed layers of dissonance and texture do somewhat diminish its overall effect. Still, Montgomery is a skillful player with a distinctive, immediately recognizable sound, and in the crowded field of solo guitarists, that can sometimes be half the battle. Though it is not quite as transcendent as the original version, it can be a hypnotic pleasure to hear Montgomery cycle through this track's revolving, raga-like melodic ideas.</p>
<p>Grouper's half of the split is even more rewarding, and the music Harris presents here is among her most focused and spellbinding to date. Though divided into four tracks, her side seems composed to be heard as one continuous whole, as her vocals and source recordings bleed from one track into the next. As with such peers as Charalambides' Christina Carter or Fursaxa's Tara Burke, there is a timeless quality to Harris' vocals on ""Hollow Press"" or ""Hold the Way"". Her simple melodies and scales can occasionally recall the medieval vocal music of Hildegard Von Bingen, which, combined with her obscured or non-existent lyrics, can give her work a delicate liturgical character.</p>
<p>Her primary backing instrument of choice here seems to be a processed Rhodes or Wurlitzer keyboard, and its warm, distorted texture blends invisibly into grainy tape effects to give the whole performance a welcome degree of hazy dissonance. It is especially lovely to hear the way these songs seem to emerge out of the static and then return again to darkness, as though they are being broadcast from an orbiting satellite that is only briefly in range of Earth, with Grouper's music already moving on to seek harmonies on another heavenly plane.</p></div>"|13837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13837-roy-montgomerygrouper/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

And not just records, mind you, but an eclectic array of records not entirely composed with sequencers and drum machines. Such seems to be the message of <i>Athens</i>, the new full-length compilation put together by the 1990s dance music figureheads. A spattering of jazz, techno, and pop, <i>Athens</i> is almost exactly what you would expect Underworld's record collection to look like, plus or minus a Mahavishnu Orchestra track.</p>
<p>Credited to Underworld vs. the Misterons, <i>Athens</i>-- 12 mostly unmixed tracks (the record features slight transitions but for the most part presents its tracks in full)-- was compiled by Underworld's Karl Hyde and Rick Smith as well as studio buddy Darren Price and friend-of-band creative-type Steven Hall. The draw here, even for dedicated Underworld fans, seems dull: The cover features a painting by Hyde, and included are the 1997 soundtrack instrumental ""Oh"" as well as a ""hidden""-- it's track 12-- collaboration between Hyde and Brian Eno that closes the album on a strong note.</p>
<p>The selections are mostly bulletproof: If you're looking for bad words against Alice Coltrane, Carl Craig, and Roxy Music, please look elsewhere.  <i>Athens</i> actually flows fairly nicely. From the near-ambience of Coltrane's ""Journey in Satchidananda"" and Squarepusher's extra-jazzy ""Theme From Sprite"" to Roxy's comparatively cohesive ""2 H.B."", then culminating with a trio of banging dance numbers, <i>Athens</i> makes a reasonable case linking improvised jazz and Underworld's brand of hard-charging dance. Surprising choices like Laurent Garnier's ""Gnaumankoudji (Broken-Afro Mix)"" and Miroslav Vitous' ""New York City"" prove Underworld's crates at least a little deeper than their average fan's. The always underrated Moodymann's ""Rectify"" even offers the missing link between the earlier jazz fusion and the later electro-funk: looped jazz samples.</p>
<p>Your enjoyment of <i>Athens</i> will depend disproportionately on how interested you are in Underworld's record collection at a time when Underworld's profile seems low, even for an aging electronic duo. <i>Athens</i>, after all, is a bit of an odd proposition (the promo materials also come stuffed with quotes from Underworld about how modern electronic music lacks musicianship). This is no surprise: You don't pull off career-defining, 13-minute shapeshifters like ""Mmm... Skyscraper I Love You"" by being modest and self-aware. Packaging a compilation of jazz-influenced work as an affront to modern trends, however, is a fresh brand of off-putting, one that begs the question of what, exactly, Underworld are listening to.</p>
<p>More likely, <i>Athens</i> is merely an innocuous pet project packaged as something more significant: There is an ocean of perception between ""Underworld vs. the Misterons: <i>Athens</i>"" and ""Underworld and friends: <i>Some Songs We Like</i>."" <i>Athens</i> never descends into outright tedium, but it offers little insight into Underworld's creativity and just as little in terms of exclusives or rare tracks. If the tracklist here promises you true discovery, or if you're an Underworld junkie, dive in, just don't be fooled by the ""project"" posturing.</p></div>"|13833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13833-athens/|4.9|Andrew Gaerig

For a small, niche-centric indie label like Underwater Peoples-- the D.C. collective responsible for nurturing some of the finest examples of 2009 lo-fi-- possessing both of these characteristics is paramount. Reach back to last June's <i>Underwater Peoples Records Showcase</i> (the first installment of what appears to be a kind of bi-annual mixtape giveaway), and you'll find a group of shaggy young artists huddled around a sound that would, in some circles, define a small chunk of last year. Take a minute to peruse the label's blog (or sometimes more helpfully, UP's sister-blog Chocolate Bobka) and you'll find a convivial comraderie amongst handlers, fans, and bands-- a genuine congregation of friends rotating in-and-out of a stable of mostly solid acts. In the case of this second spotlight LP, <i>Underwater Peoples Winter Review</i>, a handful of forward-thinking tunes helpfully draws the focus in over the cozy, close-knit sounds that anchor the label so well.</p>
<p>Here, these freshly ordained acts prove Underwater Peoples is not just the house that Real Estate built: In most instances, each new <i>Winter Review</i> artist that didn't appear on <i>Records Showcase</i> outshines the returning familiar faces. That's not to say there aren't highlights from Underwater Peoples' first wave-- Real Estate, Julian Lynch, and Liam the Younger all contribute excellent tracks that reinforce their patented sounds without much fuss or reinvention. But it's the varied collection of burgeoning outfits like Appalachian gospel maidens Mountain Man, sharp-fuzz shoegazers Big Troubles, and minimalist pop advocates Fluffy Lumbers that put up stuff so crisp and clever it almost devalues some of the same-sounding material from the smaller roster vets. It makes for some expected unevenness, but more importantly provides proof that the folks at UP have great sets of ears.</p>
<p>While <i>Records Showcase</i> worked best at ""establishing a seasonal mood"" (as Pitchfork's Joe Colly mentioned last summer), <i>Winter Review</i> hinges less on trying to approximate the chillier extremes that mark this season. However, the wintry exceptions are often standouts: Julian Lynch's opener ""Es's"" is a delicate, crystalline swirl of synthesized flute and keyboards; Fluffy Lumbers' (Frat Dad's Samuel Franklin) ""Adoration"" culls mystic boogie from some warm, fictional Fleetwood Mac B-side heard from two rooms over. And while there is an errant chill in Mountain Man's ""Dog Song"", a bewilderingly lovely number from the all-female Vermont trio, its frightening foothill-harmonies prove perennially awing.</p>
<p>Still, what's more important here is that the compilation succeeds when at its most distinct and inventive; failures can largely be attributed to a sort of general homogenization of the label's stock and trade. It's not that the sameness isn't welcome when applied properly: Real Estate's ""Orchard"" is a pretty, country-fried jam; Pill Wonder's ""Restless"" boasts woozy string clips that melt into a pleasantly churchy mid-tempo waltz; Liam the Younger's terrific closer ""Please See"" transforms a shy acoustic plea into a bright, Arcade Fire-like life-affirmer. But entries like Frat Dad's ""Totally Afraid"" (which sounds like a teenager's idea of an ironic Doors cover) or Real Estate bassist Alex Bleeker's ""These Days"" (the perfect soundtrack to watching your dad set up his brand new Margaritaville® blender) feel soggy up against more assured songwriting. Like, for instance, Air Waves' rolling strummer ""Sweetness"", a bright piece of folk-pop that sounds practically hi-fi in relation to everything else. It's in these moments we can see the real value in branching out-- however hospitable and homey Underwater Peoples needs to be, it's personality that goes a long way. And <i>Winter Review</i> has characters to spare.</p></div>"|13824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13824-underwater-peoples-winter-review/|7.3|Zach Kelly

And Guthrie's innovations went on to inspire a legion of imitators ranging from lazy shoegaze wannabes to the mighty My Bloody Valentine, though few ever improved upon his approach. That mysterious assemblage of patch chords and pedals at some point evolved from <i>a</i> sound to <i>Guthrie's</i> sound, a sonic palette with a personality all its own.</p>
<p>No surprise, then, that <i>Carousel</i>, Guthrie's first non-soundtrack solo album since 2006's <i>Continental</i>, sounds like one would expect a Robin Guthrie record to sound-- the man and his métier will forever be linked. Like <i>Continental</i> and much of Guthrie's post-Cocteaus work, the disc is instrumental, and like the best ambient music, its impact will vary. Play it quietly and Guthrie's soundscapes will come off pillow-soft; play it loudly and his compositions prove deceptively dense and not exactly prone to gaps and silence.</p>
<p>They are not, however, always memorable, and even though they are concise, they are prone to meander. But that may be the point. Longtime and likeminded Guthrie collaborator Harold Budd would, from the perspective of producer Brian Eno, ""write a piece of music, then take out all the notes [he] didn't like,"" and there's a similar simplicity to Guthrie's songs. Thanks to all the reverberating effects, they don't take that many notes to fill up all the space, and in turn all but demand to recede into the background, like a fog rolling out rather than in. The dynamics of the disc are relatively steady, the melodies redoubtably pretty, the production mostly sanded of any vestigial rough edges or volcanic peaks.</p>
<p>Yet playing in the background, the music is, thanks to its particular provenance, never anonymous, with Guthrie's carefully layered guitars as majestic as ever, rippling away like ancient tapestries given a fresh airing. And every once in a while, your brain wanders away from mood and back to the actual music, ever-evocative songs such as ""Sparkle"", ""Delight"", or the particularly dramatic (and relatively oceanic) ""Waiting by the Carousel"", with each chiming note or sustained chord steeped in Guthrie's substantial history. If gorgeous tracks such as album closer ""Little Big Fish"" must come as easily to him as breathing, listening to Guthrie exercise his lungs today remains no less entrancing than it was decades ago. It's as if this music has been resonating somewhere in stasis that whole time and has only now been released to catch up with us.</p></div>"|13536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13536-carousel/|6.5|Joshua Klein

For one, there's the different eras marked by different bandleaders, from Syd Barrett's storybook psychedelia to Roger Waters misanthropic art-rock to David Gilmour's inoffensive arena-filling stuff. But there are also more subjective takes on the Floyd's influence: you could view them as psych-prog pioneers or the bloat that inspired punk, the band that pushed the limit of the rock concert or the band that made the concert more about theatrics than music, studio wizards or mere inventors of a popular stereo test record.</p>
<p>You might divine then why Floyd appeals to the Flaming Lips right now. I count at least five of those things on that list that could be lobbed (fairly or un-) at the Lips after 27 years; being hated by Johnny Rotten is the only one (probably) beyond their reach. And their appreciation runs deep-- in an interview with Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal, Wayne Coyne remembered goofing on Jesus and Mary Chain fans by covering ""Wish You Were Here"", when the bands toured together in 1984. But why tackle hoary old <i>Dark Side</i> now, on the heels of the band's triumphant return to in-your-face psychedelic weirdness on last year's <i>Embryonic</i>? And why invite a cavalcade of characters-- Peaches, Henry Rollins, Coyne's nephew's band-- certain to make people think it's all a gag?</p>
<p>After all, <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> is an album so ingrained in the collective consciousness your grandma can probably call ""Money” from the first ring of the cash register. It was also, arguably, Floyd's big money play-- a strange thing to say for a 40-minute continuous song cycle, but a clear conclusion when you look at the swollen 20-minute epics and found-sound experiments that came before it on <i>Meddle</i> and <i>Atom Heart Mother</i>. Ambitious and as tightly wound as a symphony, <i>Dark Side</i> is nevertheless made up of detachable movements that can double as standalone pop songs and classic rock staples.</p>
<p>The Lips, of course, don't go for precision or radio-friendliness, even as they seem to be paying tribute rather than taking the piss out of Pink Floyd. Perhaps the <i>Soft Bulletin</i>-era Lips would've had some interest in recreating the grandeur of the Floyd's original, but the run-through sometimes resembles a sibling of <i>Embyronic</i>'s oddities. ""Breathe"", in both its appearances, reprises the jagged bass grooves and guitar sqwonk of ""Convinced of the Hex"" and ""See the Leaves"", while ""On the Run"" and ""Any Colour You Like"" are fractured space-boogie that echo the gloriously messy sprawl of ""Powerless"" and ""The Ego's Last Stand"".</p>
<p>Those standout instrumentals are collaborations with Stardeath and White Dwarfs, the band fronted by Wayne Coyne's nephew Dennis Coyne, and both make Coyne family reunions sound like good, illegal fun-- jammy affairs that sprinkle some much needed disco dust on Floyd's austere originals. Left to their own devices, Stardeath's take on ""Time"" and ""Brain Damage"" are less inspired, the former replacing the clockwork rhythm with coughing and panting and lost lyrics, the latter coming off relatively flat compared to the original, despite well-deployed singing saw. The kids shouldn't feel so bad, as the old guys don't fare too well themselves, neutering ""Money"" into a mechanized 8-bit lope, and minimally adjusting the track that needs the most help, the plodding ""Us and Them"".</p>
<p>The second tier of guests are also a split decision. Peaches' job is basically to moan orgasmically through ""Great Gig in the Sky"". But Henry Rollins, tasked with recreating the snippets of dialogue from Floyd's crew that float around the original, contributes all the line-reading talent you'd expect from the star of ""The Chase"" and ""Feast"". At least he doesn't attempt an English accent.</p>
<p>The guest star clusterfuck brings to mind the similar project of the Lips' former tourmate Beck, whose Record Club series brings a random cast of characters to record an album in one day. The comparison doesn't reflect well on this <i>Dark Side</i> though, which comes off stiffer than Beck's ramshackle recreations, but without much in the way of thoughtful annotations to add to the original text. At its best, it's a more unhinged take on Floyd's song cycle of insanity-- like putting the Floyd that played ""Interstellar Overdrive"" into a time machine to meet the Floyd that wrote ""Money"". But the Flaming Lips and their co-conspirators can't settle on a color of the Floyd spectrum and run with it, leaving this <i>Dark Side</i> as a lunar capsule lost somewhere between a love letter and a joke.</p></div>"|13836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13836-the-dark-side-of-the-moon/|5.2|Rob Mitchum

That seemingly contradictory perspective, looking both forward and backwards, was at play when Rjd2 wrote <i>The Colossus</i>. His fourth solo album arrives at a pivotal moment, and not just because it follows the lyrical trainwreck and one man-band overreach of <i>The Third Hand</i>. The producer is now more than a successful yet hungry talent; he's the boss, head of the new RJ's Electrical Connections imprint. Taken in tandem with the recent release of the vinyl-only career retrospective <i>2002-2010</i>, it's unsurprising he's in a reflective mood.</p>
<p><i>The Colossus</i>, as its name implies, strives for scale, but also strains a bit under a heavy burden. While Rjd2 excels at sonic collages, the mixed motives on this album-- a current spin on past techniques, a synthesis of old songs and a turn toward the future-- are difficult to balance. After years spent mastering instruments and recording techniques, he still finds a new way to overachieve, adding his own passable, if sometimes bland, live drumming to five tracks. But, as if admitting his DIY ethos and perfectionist tendencies on <i>Third Hand</i> went too far, he brought in a team of guest vocalists and instrumentalists to augment his own performances. Interlude ""Salud"", featuring a goofy British voice similar to the one on <i>Deadringer</i>, says as much: ""I've
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
assembled a healthy bunch of folks who are much more talented than I am.""</p>
<p>But more important to anyone put off by his unique foray into singer-songwriter territory, he rediscovers, or at least indulges in, some of the mood-setting backgrounds and rattling, rigged-to-explode instrumentals that originally made him such a vital producer. ""Let There be Horns"" opens the album with stretched-out, Looney Tunes strings and a vaguely Latin beat, jumping between staccato breakdowns and guitar riffs. The applause during the song's conclusion might as well be the sound of some fans breathing a collective sigh of relief on a partial return to form, since the dust-heavy samples have long been replaced with more electrified melodies.</p>
<p>But just as quickly as he comes out of the gate, ""Games Can Win"" re-enters more shaky singer-songwriter territory. While his lyrical abilities, which still haven't caught up to his compositional skills, produce some clunkers (""Play your hand close/ Like you have a glass chin""), he takes a step forward in terms of balance with appropriately toned down percussion. The rest of the album trades off between rumbling tracks like ""Small Plans"" and a few songwriting efforts like the ""The Glow"", which --with it's smug focus on having ""the glow,"" overseas accounts and living a life of leisure-- seems like the interior monologue of a bailed-out banker. It's still pretty creaky but better than the cringe-inducing moments from <i>The Third Hand</i>.</p>
<p>Rjd2 showcases a grasp of mood and a talent for arranging on <i>The Colossus</i>. His backing of Phonte Coleman's soulful vocal turn on ""Shining Path"" and the springy, triumphant synths on posse cut ""A Son's Cycle"" are both understated yet fitting. But on tracks like the eerie ""The Stranger"", rolling with punched-up drums and clipped guitars, or ""Giant Squid"", which bounces on a guttural beat, the career fusion concept pays off. His instrumental skills, and the synth-funk of <i>Since We Last Spoke</i> (in full overdrive on the movie theater sound check that is ""A Spaceship for Now"") help bring more string tones and textures to the mix, but he manages to capture some of that foreboding yet funky mood from his early work. He's spent the last few albums trying to go beyond sampling songs to creating them from scratch, and he still can sound like he's cramming tributes to half of his record collection on the same track. But when his relentless drive and sense of restraint match up, they make parts of this album a forward thinking look back.</p></div>"|13801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13801-the-colossus/|6.8|Patrick Sisson

The transition is part of the natural balance of things, and many artists unable to circumvent and survive the inevitable have been left behind, wondering what went wrong.</p>
<p>Freedy Johnston's no stranger to this familiar story. His much-lauded second album, 1992's <i>Can You Fly</i>, put him on the radar just as grunge was marginalizing singer-songwriters, and the conspicuous choice of Butch Vig as producer of his 1994 follow-up <i>This Perfect World</i> made the dialectic that much more apparent and severe. Johnston was an instantly unfashionable anachronism. All that and people still pronounced and spelled his last name ""Johnson.""</p>
<p>The funny thing about good songwriters, however, is that they often stay good, even when no one is listening. Or, in the case of Johnston, even when they stop releasing albums. <i>Rain on the City</i> marks Johnston's first album in eight years, following a series of the usual stopgaps, including live discs, demo collections, and a classy but still pretty MOR covers album. And you know what? It's pretty good. That much anyone aware of Johnston's past highpoints probably could have predicted.</p>
<p>What's more surprising is how effortless this long-in-the-making disc sounds, reminiscent of Johnston's best work without sounding consciously referential or reverential to the past, deceptively diverse despite its relatively conservative bent. Songs like ""Don't Fall in Love With a Lonely Girl"" or ""Venus Is Her Name"" are rootsy, but not quite roots rock. There are glimmers of jangly power-pop in songs such as ""The Other Side of Love"", country in ""Livin' Too Close to the Rio Grande"" and ""It's Gonna Come Back to You"", and soulful 70s AM rock in ""The Devil Raises His Own"", but none of those are really what this record is, either. Or rather, they are, but the disc is deeper than its default templates.</p>
<p>As a practiced journeyman, Johnston remains first and foremost an observant and tuneful chronicler of odd characters (one must presume including himself), small lives and lost souls with big feelings, struggling to get by in flyover country and cities alike. His sometimes wronged, often wrong-headed subjects here find hope in hopeless situations and comfort when love and luck has run out, and Johnston finds ways to convey those contradictions with a minimum of fuss heightened by plenty of melodic flourishes. His take on bossa nova, for example, ""The Kind of Love We're In"", impressively skirts light rock kitsch, and the song is better minus the knowing wink that lesser writers might have leaned on for support.</p>
<p>At every turn throughout the lean but hardly light album, Johnston once again proves himself a master of subtle songcraft, almost to a fault. Indeed, other acts would trade his ellipses for exclamation points. Yet here he is now, quietly residing in the same purgatory that houses such once-popular songwriters as disparate as Jackson Browne, John Hiatt, and Marshall Crenshaw, among countless other acts betrayed by cultural flux.

Apparently, that's what her first band was, back when she was studying geology and Mandarin Chinese at college in Minnesota. Her voice is so suited to the neo-folk path she's chosen to follow in her subsequent career that it's sort of tough to conjure an angry yelp from her. Not that she's all sweetness and light-- her albums have always housed their fair share of darkness and turmoil. They've just favored subtle ways to present those things. On her seventh album, <i>July Flame</i>, Veirs takes all the best things about her previous output, including her two justly lauded efforts for Nonesuch, and distills them into her best record.</p>
<p>Veirs has never brought so many great songs to a single album, and longtime producer Tucker Martine captures a warmth in Veirs' voice and acoustic guitar that immediately welcomes you in, from the first floating, Leonard Cohen-ish guitar part that levitates the simple album opener ""I Can See Your Tracks"". Strangely for a record released in the grip of winter, <i>July Flame</i> has the atmosphere of a sweet summer night, with fireflies and an insect chorus-- it's not the direct heat of a summer day, but a fading, residual heat. It's also a patient record built around vocal melody and flashes of lyrical imagery.</p>
<p>The summer feel is probably not accidental-- a July flame is a type of peach-- and it proves good inspiration for a lot of surprising and truly lovely moments. The title track orbits a simple but sturdy electric guitar phrase and mallet drumming, mixing real viola with a string synthesizer for a really interesting texture leading up to the choral final chorus. The instrumentation sometimes looks odd on paper-- a pump organ here, a bass clarinet there, tenor sax in a folk setting, but every unorthodox choice is well-made. Eyvind Kang's viola is played in a style halfway between bluegrass fiddling and classical formalism on ""Where Are You Driving?"", mingling with the pump organ and banjo to create a weird little world. Stephen Barber's string arrangement on the troubled but optimistic closer ""Make Something Good"" is less window dressing than a yearning answer to her assertion, ""It's gonna take a long, long time/ But we're gonna make something so fine.""</p>
<p>There are a couple of spectacular song's at the record's heart-- ""Summer Is the Champion"" is a swinging rave-up that bursts with horns after its second jazz-inflected chorus, while ""Wide-Eyed, Legless"" is a mysterious, almost Floydian psych-folk song with an utterly infectious verse melody. But Veirs is just as effective in the understated moments. ""When You Give Your Heart"" wrings gobs of loveliness from just a few guitars and a canny rhythmic shift to the chorus, and then there's ""Carole Kaye"", a sweet and clearly heartfelt tribute to the great session bassist with lyrics fashioned from the titles of the some of the many huge hits Kaye played on. The refrain ""It would be so cool to be like Carol, Carol Kaye"" is disarming in its refreshing modesty.</p>
<p>Veirs probably doesn't need to be so modest-- her band of Kang, Martine, Steve Moore, Jon Neufield, and longtime collaborator Karl Blau is bolstered by a couple of big guests in My Morning Jacket's Jim James and the Decemberists' guitarist Chris Funk. But a little bit of starry-eyed hero worship amidst all the poetic imagery keeps the album grounded in spite of all its poetic flights, and <i>July Flame</i> is ultimately a record that's easy to get into and just as easy to stay with.</p></div>"|13783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13783-july-flame/|7.5|Joe Tangari

It was classic post-rock, updated with a slight twist. In part because of the nod from ATP (who know a thing or two about forward-thinking musicians), the group looked at the time like possible successors to genre vets like Tortoise and Mogwai. Since then, Apse shed a few members and decamped to Cape Cod to record their latest, <i>Climb Up</i>-- a vast departure from <i>Spirit </i>that trades their debut's gloomy swirl for a more linear, prog-leaning take on chugging radio rock.</p>
<p>While I can certainly appreciate a band's desire to shake things up or approach its audience more directly, in this case the aesthetic shift doesn't seem to suit Apse's strengths. Their new formula, which puts a greater empasis on riffs and frontman Robert Toher's distracting vocal whine, swaps out the dreaminess of past recordings for something closer in style to the Mars Volta at their most straightforward, or more accurately, Muse. The ethereal qualities of <i>Spirit</i> have mostly gone missing, and with the exception of a few charming instrumental numbers (the pastoral psychedelia of ""Tropica"" and ""In Gold""), <i>Climb Up</i> is filled with an odd (for indie listeners, at least) brand of stadium-sized rock that can't quite escape the notions of cheese and bloat that accompany that term.</p>
<p>Apse recorded the album themselves and do better with weight-- the sound is big and dense-- than they do economy. <i>Climb Up</i>'s 12 tracks clock in at almost 60 minutes, and its individual pieces are stretched beyond their natural limits. That's particularly true on the slow-building numbers like ""Lie"", where Toher tests us, drawing each quavering vocal note out to several seconds over a plodding <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> instrumental. Though a few winning songs are sprinkled throughout-- ""3.1"" nicely blends two sets of vocals over heavy stomps and chiming guitars-- even the faster-paced material here comes off as needling and overwrought. (Seemingly radio-ready prog-rock numbers ""Rook"", ""The Age"", and ""The Whip"" all suffer this fate.) By the time I get to the end of the record, which revs up the melody and swing too late, I'm spent. Toher goes on to claim on the final track ""Closure"" that he's ""never had a party as cool as this one"", and, man, I hope that's not true.</p></div>"|13819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13819-climb-up/|4.3|Joe Colly

His reasons for dropping that name are probably boring and copyright-related, but still: The name change seems healthy on whole other extra-legal levels. I've never known anyone not to be wowed by Final Fantasy's live show, and Final Fantasy's live show is just Owen Pallett: the guy himself, a violin, and a loop pedal. It's about as solo as anything gets-- a performance, not a project. Stepping out under his own name feels like an acknowledgement of this, as if Pallett's ready to cast aside the modesty of having a ""project""-- <i>it's just this thing I've been working on</i>-- and present himself, fully upright, as an artist.</p>
<p>And there are a <i>lot</i> of things about <i>Heartland</i> that feel like Pallett is presenting himself more and more fully as an artist; the scope of breadth and mood of it are all grander, more assured, making ever more of a case that the guy shouldn't be viewed as a side note (string arranger for the Arcade Fire, the Pet Shop Boys) or a minor interest (D&amp;D enthusiast, guy who titled an album <i>He Poos Clouds</i>). After all, one of this album's closest cousins in the indie world is a notable, well-regarded one: Joanna Newsom's <i>Ys</i>. Both are ambitious, classicist, cleverly arranged, lyrically high-concept, dense with possible meaning-- and, yes, a little strange.</p>
<p>It's that density that separates them, though, and makes me regret having to review this record in any kind of timely fashion. I'm still smarting over having underrated Pallett's last full-length; I knew I loved it, but had no way of knowing it would stick with me for months, years. And this one is richer: Pallett has leaped beyond arranging for chambers and quartets, working now with electronics, with drums, with electric bass, with the Czech Philharmonic, with Nico Muhly. These are pop songs through and through-- lively, propulsive ones. But the wonder of them is in those arrangements, which are just ripe with motion and detail-- and they're not decorative (as was sometimes the case with <i>Ys</i>), but central. The most immediate track here, ""Lewis Takes Action"", has Pallett singing grand, anthemic hooks, but the parts you're most likely to wind up humming are the stately brass and woodwind figures between them-- the amount of care and pleasure in these arrangements is extremely generous.</p>
<p>If you're wondering who ""Lewis"" is and what sort of action he's taking, well, this is one of the things that's just singular and fascinating about Pallett, every bit as much as his music-school voice or the charmingly mannered way he approaches his melodies. On <i>He Poos Clouds</i>, Pallett seemed to be singing about real people, even ordinary ones; it was just that they tended to describe their emotional states in the grand terms of Dungeons &amp; Dragons magic and conjuring. Since then, Pallett's jumped fully into fantasy: These twelve songs are monologues from Lewis, an ""ultra-violent farmer"" in a world called Spectrum, as he tries to come to grips with his own creator, Owen Pallett. Daunting as that might sound-- there may be hand-to-hand combat with a cockatrice involved-- all it really means is that these are songs about power and faith and control: songs that allow you to sing lines like, ""the night is split by the whistle of my amber whip,"" and have it be about feeling your own power, or just repeat, ""I'm never gonna give it to you,"" and have it be about rejecting someone else's.</p>
<p>You'll have to get back to me in a few months to see how it all unravels, but in the meantime these songs are steadily revealing ever more to love. Martial drums and strings rumbling tense in the foreground with clouds of strings overhead. The sly, soulful melody of ""Oh Heartland, Up Yours!""-- something that feels new in Pallett's repertoire. A kind of orchestral <i>motorik</i> beat on ""Tryst with Mephistopheles"". The way something like an 808 kick drum loops its way darkly into ""Red Sun No. 5"". Hints of Kurt Weill. This stuff is rich with ideas, and they're offered in the kind of rich, warm sound that should be accessible to more fans than ever before. Those of you with the inclination to pick them up will find a lot to reward you.</p></div>"|13830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13830-heartland/|8.6|Nitsuh Abebe

Early works like ""Cheating, Lying, Stealing"" were statements of intent-- the bristling sort that artistically inflamed young men are prone to making-- and they encapsulated much of downtown New York's hardy oppositional spirit. Twenty-some years later, they are foundational texts for an entire new generation of gleeful polyglots who can't wait to mix their avant-punk, art-rock, electronic, and whatever-else records in with their childhood classical training.</p>
<p>In 2008, this lifelong iconoclast won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for <i>The Little Match Girl Passion</i>. The 35-minute oratorio brought mainstream institutional acceptance to a career defined, at least in part, by its absence, and Lang seemed equally grateful and nonplussed by the honor.  <i>The Little Match Girl Passion</i> is a breathtakingly spare and icily gorgeous adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of the same name, and on the surface it couldn't be further from the punky provocations of Lang's youth. It is scored for only four voices-- soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, with the occasional addition of hand bells and percussion-- and the resulting sound world has more in common with Renaissance sacred music or English madrigals than the hip post-minimalism Lang is known for.</p>
<p>To some of his acolytes, this sort of thing might look suspiciously like softening with old age. But Lang hasn't softened so much as deepened.  Over the last 10 years, he's been increasingly pairing his brasher works with hesitant, quietly spiritual pieces that open up onto more expansive internal vistas, and his <i>Passion</i> is the culmination of this tendency. The Hans Christian Andersen fable is fantastically dark, one of those children's stories that still startles in its brutality. The titular little girl is sent out by her abusive father on New Year's Eve to sell matches, but finds herself ignored by passersby. Unable to return home without money, she tries to warm and distract herself by lighting matches, which summon comforting memories of her grandmother's house on Christmas morning. As she slowly freezes to death, the memories and visions become more vivid until they envelop her. She is found dead in the morning, clutching a handful of burnt-out matches but wearing a beatific smile.</p>
<p>Lang has taken this story, with its impossible-to-miss religious overtones, and cast it as a Passion play. The piece is specifically modeled on Bach's <i>St. Matthew Passion</i>, which interrupts the story of Jesus' death with other texts that reflect and comment on the action. This treatment might sound ripe for egregious emotional manipulation, but Lang has nothing of the sort in mind; his gaze is clear-eyed and subdued. In interviews about the work, Lang has alluded to watching the Zapruder film and being struck by how its slow-motion graininess and silence amplifies the tragedy of the Kennedy assassination by placing it behind glass.  It doesn't matter which frame of that fated motorcade you see; they are all equally devastating. By breaking up the timeline of the little match girl's suffering with choral lamentations, he has accomplished something similar. From <i>Passion</i>'s opening moments-- a slowly accumulating round of voices chanting rhythmic variations on the words ""come"" and ""daughter""-- the tragedy of the story's end is already present.</p>
<p>The work is relentlessly minimal, though it feels too unstuck in time to be pegged as ""minimalism."" With an almost ascetic discipline, Lang builds the piece out of tiny melodic cells-- four- or five-note fragments that he wraps around each other again and again, until they produce a haunting and evocative hall of echoes. The heart-stopping ""Have Mercy My God"", for instance, is composed of just two minor chords, broken into five pitches each, which reiterate endlessly and tangle slowly at the edges. Most sections make use of a similar number of notes, the ones that you can find on the piano under one hand without stretching. This humble insistence on economy reinforces the work's theme; Lang seems to be determinedly chiseling away at his music, tuning out outside clamor to hone in on a more elusive inner transmission. In its own quizzical, probing way, <i>The Little Match Girl Passion</i> is as much a devotional piece as the Bach <i>Passion</i> it is modeled on, and with it, Lang has produced the most profound and emotionally resonant work of his career.</p></div>"|13775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13775-the-little-match-girl-passion/|8.5|Jayson Greene

<p>But 30 years on, it's hard to hear <i>The Blue Mask</i> as sonically assaultive so much as <i>brutally personal</i>, in a way that's got less to do with guitar dissonance than Reed's fearless self-laceration. Not since ""Heroin"" had Reed written a song as harrowing as ""The Blue Mask"", where the lyrics have the hideous specificity of a newly sober man unleashing a lot of backed-up self-examination. 1983's <i>Legendary Hearts</i>-- which reassembles most of the <i>Blue Mask</i> band, swapping drummer Fred Maher for Doane Perry-- is fleeter and funnier where the previous album ground down at its themes. It's playful without being indulgent, the kind of record hardcore fans come to treasure because it proves that even their hero's second-tier efforts, the ones that get passed over when they're not starred in the record guides, can hide secret charms.</p>
<p>What impresses 27 years on is Reed's range: ""Don't Talk to Me About Work"" is a nasty little one-note jab at 9-to-5 drudgery, akin to the gags that littered early Replacements albums (albeit way more literate, as you'd expect). But it's followed by ""Make Up Mind"", a ballad as tender as anything on <i>The Velvet Underground</i>, Reed and Quine feeding each other little bursts and swells of melody as the bass and drums keep heartbeat time. That range sometimes gets him into trouble, however. Reed's voice-- an instrument suited to, well, Lou Reed songs and very little else-- remains the most divisive component of his music. New listeners, or those not already charmed by his penchant for stretching his monotone sing-song via dramatic hops down an octave or two, may cringe a bit at the ultra-mannered emoting on ""Betrayed"". But by 1983, Reed had mastered the conversational style that starts with ""I'm Waiting for the Man"". The mumble-murmur of ""Turn Out the Light"" is so clearly Reed, providing such a specific kind of pleasure, that it might as well come with a trademark symbol attached to each line.</p>
<p>1984's gussied-up <i>New Sensations</i> sounds initially like a typically nuts Reed all-change after the naked sludge and howl of the previous two albums. Quine and Reed have separated-- in what must have seemed an astoundingly counterintuitive move given the results-- and Quine seems to have gotten the distortion pedals in the settlement. With the feedback and loathing dialed back considerably, the music itself is damn near power-pop in comparison, and the album's self-consciously big-and-clean production is second-string 1984 pop in a nutshell. The songs themselves range from just-okay to damned catchy, perhaps nodding to Reed's earliest days as a Brill Building-era hopeful. And since few artists have made such a virtue out of minimal arrangements, you'd assume an album of Reed bubblegum rock would be, at least, pleasantly perverse.</p>
<p>But rather than let his guitar do any sort of heavy-lifting, Reed can't seem to resist adding a gospel choir or an off-the-rack string section or some such nonsense. The backing vocalists on ""My Red Joystick"", with their Vegas-y ersatz soul interjections, might have well been on loan from an ABC record. What can you say: That's how major label record-making went in the mid-80s, even with infamous proto-punk geniuses. Its a shame, because when Reed can restrain himself-- check the pastoral, late-Talking Heads-ish lope of the title track-- <i>New Sensations</i> has the makings of a curious new avenue for Reed's songwriting, a kind of ""<i>Sally Can't Dance</i> done right."" But the period touches, which just feel intrusive at this distance and never reach the unhinged heights of the Anglo-soul class of 1984, make <i>New Sensations</i> a curious period piece and little more.</p></div>"|13827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13827-legendary-hearts-new-sensations/|6.9|Jess Harvell

The band mostly avoided the church burnings and murders that made black metal notorious-- its core of vocalist/guitarist Abbath, drummer Horgh, and lyricist/ex-guitarist Demonaz has remained squeaky clean. They're not Satanists; they're inspired by Norway's wintry landscapes. Their lyrics often describe a fantasy world called Blashyrkh. For evidence of the band's un-hipness, do a Google Images search for ""Immortal."" You'll see some of the silliest band photos ever taken. Essentially, Immortal took KISS' white-faced shtick to risible extremes. The band is the butt of jokes inside and outside of metal.</p>
<p>Its music isn't, however. Out of the ""second wave"" of black metal (the ""first wave"" consisted of proto-black metal like Venom, Bathory, and Hellhammer), Immortal's music has held up the strongest. Darkthrone and Ulver don't play black metal anymore. Enslaved and Satyricon moved towards prog rock and rock'n'roll, respectively. Mayhem and Gorgoroth have suffered from inconsistent lineups leading to inconsistent music.</p>
<p>Immortal's core members, on the other hand, have perfected a singular sound. Their debut, 1992's <i>Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism</i>, was a glorious, lo-fi blur. But the band's sound gradually sharpened. The drumming became more linear and precise. The guitars grew faster and more focused. Eventually, the band became an interesting combination of opposites. Its streams of blastbeats were hypnotic, yet Abbath's riffs were grand and melodic, referencing thrash and traditional metal. He sang about big things-- war, winds, and winter-- in a lovable, Popeye-esque croak. While the band's makeup came from black metal, its music had none of the genre's blasphemy or misanthropy.</p>
<p><i>All Shall Fall</i> emphasizes this in a big way. Its predecessors this decade, <i>Damned in Black</i> and <i>Sons of Northern Darkness</i>, featured clean production unusual for black metal. <i>All Shall Fall</i> sounds even more polished. It has state-of-the-art production, with highly compressed drums, huge-sounding guitars, and a massive overall soundscape. The sound may be startling for those accustomed to black metal's typical rawness. It's unconventional even for Immortal; the
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
band now has a sound fit for stadiums. But the technical wizardry is appropriate. It brings out the fact that Abbath is a phenomenal guitarist. His axe chugs, sings, and weaves gleaming webs. Horgh no longer sounds like a drum machine left unattended. He pounds hard, buttressing Abbath's riffs with rousing syncopations. The result is powerful. <i>All Shall Fall</i> may be the closest black metal has come to sounding like the northern winds it references. When Abbath sings about ""warriors with cold blazing eyes,"" he could be referring to Immortal.</p></div>"|13671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13671-all-shall-fall/|7.1|Cosmo Lee

Look around you: These are people you've worked with 40 hours a week, for months, if not years. And yet you got to <i>really </i>know them better after a mere 40 minutes spent outside the office. It's interesting how this has applied to Rilo Kiley: since <i>The Execution of All Things</i>, they've been blatantly bear-hugging the most outwardly tacky and glossy aspects of pop music (except the songs), but each of their solo endeavors could be taken as a show of one-upmanship in ""keepin' it real"". Guitarist Blake Sennett followed the lead of the Postal Service by forming the Elected, a Jimmy Tamborello-endorsed indie-country act; Jenny Lewis' two solo albums boasted a rootsiness almost completely inverse to the arc of her main gig; while bassist Pierre de Reeder makes inward-looking folk-pop. And now, drummer Jason Boesel is letting <i>his </i>freak-flag fly with... an album of what might have been known about 15 years ago as alt-country.</p>
<p>Now, that's about as entry-level as genres get for those looking to make their solo bow, but Boesel's C.V. checks out: after playing in the Elected, right around when Bright Eyes went full-bore (in both ways) troubadour, he joined its touring lineup, and would eventually contribute two songs to Conor Oberst's Mystic Valley Band album. Benmont Tench, Orenda Fink, and David Rawlings pay back favors by contributing to <i>Hustler's Son</i>, so you know it's going to sound tasteful. Boesel has a sturdy voice that sidles up nicely with the lower registers of the National's Mat Berninger and Okkervil River's Will Sheff, though he does lend himself to a bit of distracting hayseed diction. It's not quite as much of an issue on the opening ""Black Wave"", a country-noir piece that finds him rambling through Tennessee on a horse with no name, setting a loping pace that extends throughout and belies the album's title. The lyrics rarely become pointed outside of an interesting turn of phrase (""I thought I was a secret/ But I was too easy to keep""), but the specter of death and personal heartache hover over <i>Hustler's Son</i>.</p>
<p>Even if the formalism of his songwriting tends to ensure that they never go somewhere you don't expect, Boesel occasionally builds to some rousing choruses that shake off the generally languorous mood. The hook of murder ballad ""Hand of God"" reaches for the rafters despite the heavy weight of guilt on its narrator and the lumbering waltz of ""I Got the Reason #1"" picks through the best parts of Grant Lee Buffalo's <i>Copperopolis, </i>though the latter's momentum is squandered when Boesel's pen game goes all Juelz Santana by repeating the same word at the end of nearly every line (""Was It, Man?"").</p>
<p>But the obvious question becomes, ""Hey, I've never heard a second of Rilo Kiley in my life. What's this album going to do for me?"" Tough call: For Boesler, association does more to make <i>Hustler's Son </i>stand out than its preciously few musical curveballs. ""Getting Healthy (Good Luck)"" is the one track that nods towards Boesler's day job as stickman, but as a songwriter, he can't find his footing in the rhythm, and the title track, supposedly the first song he ever wrote, has an easy-going early Wilco vibe, but demands a vocal with more wear or grit in it. In its defense, <i>Hustler's Son </i>isn't spectacular, but it's an honest and modest document.  Considering the path Rilo Kiley's music has taken in the past half-decade, those qualities might be better off staying in-house.</p></div>"|13828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13828-hustlers-son/|5.5|Ian Cohen

After releasing two albums of warped noise-pop under different combinations of weird names, Avey Tare, Panda Bear, Deakin, and Geologist were still learning how to integrate their distinct electro-acoustic preoccupations. The ""Animal Collective"" brand was later affixed to it, but <i>Campfire Songs</i> was originally intended to be the album's eponymous title. In truth, it's more appropriate. It's not simply that they hadn't picked a name; they really <i>weren't </i>Animal Collective yet. This was before the ""Letterman"" appearances and spectrum-wide media interest; before they became the object of hit pieces and big-picture rants in the trenches of online journalism; before Deakin wanted you to help him play Mali-- basically, before Animal Collective got about as formidable, culturally and aesthetically, as a modern indie band can be. This release retroactively stresses how hard they must have had to push to get there.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It was the only time they used the name ""Campfire Songs"", and the album has other peculiarities. It's the only one featuring this exact line-up (Geologist didn't play, only ran the MiniDisc recorders, on the Maryland porch where the five songs were captured in one long take.) It's much more acoustic than electro, made chiefly of intertwined voices, softly droning guitars, and light natural ambiance. It's an uncommonly easeful entry into their catalog, and an important pivot. The feeling of discovery that attends it is not incidental. ""Congregate,"" they moan portentously on ""Moo Rah Rah Rain"". The album sounds like a careful group of musicians on the verge of figuring out what they are.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As such, it lacks the authoritative veneer and durability of later records, from <i>Sung Tongs</i> onward. If you'd have said, based on this album, that these guys would be a cultural bellwether in a few years, people would have thought you were nuts (or at least massively stoned). It's difficult now to conceive of Animal Collective without vigorous rhythms, vibrant electronics, and a certain formality to their arrangements of chaos. But in retrospect, <i>Campfire Songs</i> already contains many essential elements that would come to define the band: Glowing vocal harmonies, the fearless use of negative space, the little snips and grafts that always temper their naturalism. The music also illustrates the drift away from masculine beats and toward sensual waves that has been indie music's prevailing current in recent years, as rock influences have lost ground. The ghosts of 1960s psychedelia and British folk haunt the vocal and guitar techniques at times, but this sound was in no way trembling on the verge of broad accessibility. They would take it there with sheer resolve, by broadening their ambition and stretching their comfort zone.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Beyond its canonical interest, <i>Campfire Songs</i> has its own charms. Though rigorously composed, it feels deceptively spontaneous. The atmosphere is both inviting and severe, and startlingly vivid. It's difficult to argue that it's among their best, but it could easily be your favorite, because its allure is so simple and pure. You can feel the crisp air outside where they are recording, and it feels inescapably like nighttime. It's very much like sitting by a campfire, with a hot face and freezing back. While the album's impact is limited on a song-by-song basis, it has a powerful cumulative effect.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It plays out with all the surges of inspiration and subtle modulations of mood of a mushroom trip or whatever kind of spiritual journey you favor, through the scraps of Spanish guitar of ""Two Corvettes"" and the shimmering ""Moo Rah Rah Rain"". The trip is beautifully completed with full-bore pastoral ""De Soto De Son"", where day breaks at last. It's the perfect cap to the record, not just aesthetically, but symbolically. Birds twitter, waking up with everything else, and the tape hiss really does seem to brighten. There's a total sense of calm, renewal, a journey completed, knowledge refreshed. Normal time resumes, and for the conglomerate creature now known as Animal Collective, it's time to get to work.</p></div>"|13818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13818-campfire-songs/|7.2|Brian Howe

Does he cackle to himself when critics note every name change or parse every reference to darkness and light? For someone who maintains a steady stream of releases, Oldham remains elusive, impossible to pin down. Take his latest, a live album titled <i>Funtown Comedown</i>, released digitally and on vinyl with little fanfare during the final days of 2009. As the story goes, he recorded it in the ""metaphysical community"" of <i>Funtown</i>, which lies just outside the Louisville of the mind. One presumes the hamlet appears in the mist annually and exists solely to host Oldham's shows.</p>
<p>If Oldham didn't make good music, we might laugh right back at him. But for nearly 20 years, he has proved not only prolific but indefatigable, always ready with a quick hook and a dark thought on mortality and music. <i>Funtown Comedown</i> pulls from every corner of his rich catalog, spanning his first EP (opener ""Ohio River Boat Song"") through his recent peaks (""The Glory Goes"", from 2008's <i>Lie Down in the Light</i>). This being an Oldham release, these aren't simply run-throughs of familiar songs. He studiously avoids redundancy by constantly reinterpreting and reinventing his songs. Here, he resets them in a string-band context, courtesy of the Picket Line.</p>
<p>Louisville's the Picket Line accompany him with a ramshackle sound and a hootenanny dynamic that fit his ramblin' songs nicely. The spry performances make some of the studio versions sound dour by comparison, as the musicians punctuate the songs with shouts and hollers. They actually howl like junkyard curs on ""Wolf Among Wolves"", and whoop it up on the clap-along closer ""Idle Hands Are the Devil's Playthings"". Cheyenne Mize plays Loretta Lynn to Oldham's Conway Twitty, harmonizing sweetly on ""We All Us Three Will Ride"" and ""You Want That Picture"". Oldham has duetted with so many female singers over the years, from Scout Niblett to former Frente! frontwoman Angie Hart, but Mize makes a dashing foil for him, with a wry, crystalline tone to counter his grainier, hangdog voice. (They released an under-everybody's-radar EP last year on Karate Body Records.)</p>
<p>The Picket Line kick up the dust on the first set, delivering a stormy take on Ralph Stanley's ""Hemlocks and Primroses"" complete with raucous call and response, but they quiet down a bit on the second set. Cleetus Redundementia's bass makes a comfy bed for Oldham and Mize's vocals on the soft, subtly sinister ""Lay and Love"", and Pork Chop's ""outta-tune banjo"" snakes through the ruminative ""Rider"" (these are the names listed on their MySpace, so don't blame me). As with most of the current crop of string bands, there's a strong Appalachian feel to these new interpretations, as if the musicians have modeled themselves after the Carter Family. But they shoot these songs full of classic Nashville country flourishes and Kentucky bluegrass filigrees, and their Bakersfield licks light up their cover of Merle Haggard's ""Rambling Fever"" and ""May It Always Be"" like fireworks. This is Oldham's flip-side America, where regional distinctions and variations compress into one sound. His idiosyncratic brand of traditional music, wherever he makes it and under whichever guise, has always sounded both otherworldly and earthy, and <i>Funtown</i> <i>Comedown</i> demonstrates how that contradiction energizes his music and enlivens a genre that too often gets bogged down in reverence and gravity.</p></div>"|13803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13803-funtime-comedown/|7.3|Stephen M.

Damon Gough's debut as BDB, <i>The Hour of Bewilderbeast</i>, arrived back in 2000, winning the Mercury Music Prize (besting out, among others, fellow Mancunians Doves, who play on the record) and introducing Gough's shambling musical persona, one that veered radically from hushed pastoral folk to scattershot rock. He followed the strong debut with the impressive soundtrack to <i>About a Boy</i>, which found Gough increasingly focused while embracing his inner Harry Nilsson.</p>
<p>But by <i>Have You Fed the Fish?</i>-- and this was still only 2002-- Gough seemed to be running out of creative steam. The personal, dour <i>One Plus One Is One</i> didn't turn things around, and the dull <i>Born in the UK</i> failed to deliver as well. So: it's back to the well with <i>Is There Nothing We Could Do?</i>, Gough's return to the world of soundtracks, specifically ""music inspired by the motion picture <i>The Fattest Man in Britain</i>,"" a British TV movie starring Timothy Spall as the titular big man.</p>
<p>Gough proved himself adept at spring-boarding off the work of others before, and the same holds true this time around. Bobbling between songs, themes, and snatches of dialogue, Gough captures the right tone of wistfulness and sensitivity in his typically pretty tunes-- melancholy croon-and-swoon chamber folk and pop with an emphasis on upright bass and piano. As with<i> About a Boy</i>, instrumental cues seamlessly rub against more traditional songs. And although most of us can only imagine how well Gough's touching tracks fit the film, he conveys a healthy mixture of sad and hopeful captured in cuts such as the title track, the gorgeous ""Welcome Me to Your World"", ""Just Look at Us Now"", ""Wider Than a Smile"", and ""I'll Carry On"", songs so winningly winsome they survive being recycled again and again across the set as incidental cues like ""Guitar Medley"".</p>
<p>In the end, the repetition actually serves to heighten the sense of <i>Is There Nothing We Could Do?</i> as some sort of song cycle, although the cynical may note that fragments such as ""Been There, Verified"" would work just as well for the average anonymous advert. But what is a record if not ultimately an advertisement for the artist at hand's particular talents? Listened to as such,<i> Is There Nothing</i> represents a bit of a return to form. While only time will tell if Gough can keep up the good work, fans waiting for a sign of his former self can rest assured the qualities that made his music so appealing the first time around remain pleasantly intact and, thankfully, no longer dormant.</p></div>"|13826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13826-is-there-nothing-we-could-do/|6.6|Joshua Klein

During this era, producers creatively applied the various brands of insectile precision and druggy torpor they'd perfected in tracks with warmer, more organic-feeling sound design inspired by various moments in early 1990s house, not to mention ethnodelic touches ripped from world music of all stripes. The conventional wisdom is that this halfway house between the old futurism and the new traditionalism had been creatively exhausted within about 12 months of its emergence, but it's easy to confuse and conflate a swell of copycat tracks with a bottoming of the creative well. In truth, this sound had barely scratched the surface when trends shifted to a somewhat stultifying brand of straightjacketed house and techno classicism. Admittedly, it doesn't help that so much of this warmer ""deep"" minimalism got a bit, well, bad, with artists deploying African chant samples or tepid bongo performances with a grim air of necessity.</p>
<p>It's almost comforting, then, to find that Radio Slave's mix for Fabric sounds almost like a tribute to 2007, in the best sense. Here's a reminder of when this sound seemed filled with promise, with its near-seamless blend of lush, hypnotic minimal-into-house, endlessly percolating synth patterns, and softly clanking percussion. Of course, it's not like Radio Slave could have done differently: having spent the last couple of years making of himself the go-to-guy for infinitely patient, mind-altering house, the dude (real name Matt Edwards) suddenly reforming himself as a U.S. deep house disciple would have seemed particularly tasteless. As it is, the producer's decision to remain true to his initial aesthetic (and that of his label, Rekids) is an excellent outcome, offering a precarious extension of life for a sound that in some ways has suffered from a premature creative foreclosure.</p>
<p>Of course, the reasons people would eye-roll over such a prospect are present and correct: As you might expect from a guy whose own tracks can be so long and repetitive, where the only options left are ecstatic meditation or total coma, there are times when <i>Fabric 48</i> gets a little, well, dry and desiccated. Nina Kravis's ""Pain in the Ass"" is the kind of hyper-minimal bleep track that everyone would ignore if not for the (not even terribly compelling) detached female monologue over the top-- typically, it's one of the best-known tracks here. Likewise, if there's a point to the unrelieved kickdrum pound of the following track ""Balada Redo"" by DJ Boola, I'm missing it.</p>
<p>But maybe these moments are necessary. Perhaps the asceticism of Edwards' approach gives the flashes of color and melody just that little bit of extra luster needed to push them over the top. So the horn samples on Brothers' Vibe's ""Platter Sugar"" sound celebratory rather than merely diverting, while the rolling piano and scintillating percussion of Michel Cleis' remix of Spencer Parker's ""The Beginning"" can seem near-life-changing. Part of Edwards' talent and skill is that his negotiation of the narcoleptic and the arm-waving actually intensifies the highs rather than simply subjecting the listener to unnecessary lows.</p>
<p>Michel Cleis reappears late in the mix with the marvelous (relative) anthem ""La Mezcla"", its trilling flute line and layered Spanish vocals providing what would be the set's peak if it made sense to think of it in those terms. The tune-- catchy, inventive, ""deep"" (not just in the sense of ""deep house"", but in the sense of bewitching layering, each listen allowing you to catch some new nuance)-- is a telling reminder that this particular sound was never about simply slapping a bongo pattern on top of a 10-minute groove anymore than minimal was ""about"" fashioning rhythm loops out of the sound of cockroaches fornicating. Rather, it's about the delicate interplay between old and new, between flesh and metal, between solipsistic drug taking and vicarious global tourism. More simply, it's about interplay in itself, and the fact that sometimes music on its way from one place to another can be much more exciting and, well, fun, than music that's arrived at its destination. I won't mind if Edwards remains creatively stuck for a little while longer.</p></div>"|13791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13791-fabric-48/|7.1|Tim Finney

Turned out the problem was the doll had a switch on its back set to ""evil"" and with a flick of the wrist, it could be reset to ""good."" It feels like sometime late last summer, someone flicked a similar switch on Lady Gaga. For about a year, she was nothing but a lot of talk and a badge-- only without the badge. She filled her résumé and interviews with style icon namedrops-- Andy Warhol and his notions on celebrity, the denizens of New York's downtown arts scene, and avant couture designers like Thierry Mugler-- but her singles betrayed none of the artistry that she insisted was part of her package. ""Poker Face"" had about three big hooks, but next to her other singles-- which ran the gamut from forgettable fluff (""Just Dance"") to ""Muffin Top"" (""LoveGame"")-- it seemed like a fluke. Then, between the VMAs and ""Paparazzi"", she came into her own. And on ""Bad Romance"", the lead single from <i>The Fame Monster</i>, she became kind of awesome.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>The Fame Monster</i>-- out late last year, while we at Pitchfork were wrapping up our 2009 content-- isn't as strong as its lead single (although the Queen-like ""Speechless"" comes close), but it at least stakes a claim that Gaga is a potential new Madonna rather than simply a new Katy Perry. If I had to guess, I'd say once she became hideously popular Gaga was able to take more control of her career, the early result being ""Bad Romance"", arguably the best pop single and best pop video of 2009. And the video is part of the package: Like Madonna or Prince, it's impossible to separate the song from the performer. But unlike those artists, Lady Gaga isn't particularly attractive, and she uses this to her advantage by suppressing her vanity and making herself a slippery figure. She's still largely unknowable and also almost unrecognizable from moment to

moment, as she contorts, disguises, masks and maims her face and body like a Matthew Barney or David Cronenberg creation.</p>
<p>Gaga comments on fame as she becomes more famous: It's in her record titles-- <i>The Fame</i>, <i>The Fame Monster</i>, ""Paparazzi"", ""Beautiful, Dirty, Rich"", ""Starstruck"". It's also in her wearable art, and the way she deconstructs her own look-- rigid, robotic dance moves as if she's a puppet on a string, moving in crutches after being damaged by her outsized fictional celebrity in the ""Paparazzi"" clip. In ""Bad Romance"" she alters whoever Lady Gaga the Pop Star might be into any number of female types-- at times recalling Britney Spears, Madonna, an Anime character, Angelique, Christina Aguilera, and Amy Winehouse. In that sense, she's a perfect 21st century pop icon-- a regular person willing to manipulate herself into whatever it takes at any given moment to be a star.</p>
<p>And yet, unlike the empty famewhores climbing atop the shoulders of reality TV and tabloid journalism to notoriety, we know next to nothing about her personal life. In that sense, she's the anti-Kanye, the anti-Eminem, and the anti-Winehouse-- the twists and turns of her private life don't inform her art. Rather, she is whoever she wants to be at any time, and her art is as much the manipulation of that image and notions of modern celebrity as it is music or fashion. And it's refreshing to have a big pop star communicating to us from afar, like pop stars used to.</p>
<p>Everything about ""Bad Romance"" is big but oddly clean and direct-- whooshing synths, jarring rhythms, and stratospheric choruses. It's not an earworm so much as something designed to just take over a listener, to force them to pay attention the way Gaga's image seems to have done to people in recent months. Sure, the choruses were also skybound on ""Poker Face"" and ""Paparazzi"", but they seemed bigger by working as a counterpoint to other elements of the song-- the odd way Gaga makes her voice go deep and guttural, the terrible sing-speaking she has ideally abandoned. ""Bad Romance"", on the other hand, has two volumes: 10 and 11. In that sense, it's almost template breaking-- reminiscent of stadium house with Gaga as a new KLF, fucking with us from the inside. (No surprise that it sounds so European either-- it comes across like futurist pop music without any hints of hip-hop's influence.)</p>
<p>Elsewhere on <i>The Fame Monster</i>, she morphs into other stars-- Freddie Mercury on ""Speechless"", ABBA on ""Alejandro"", Madonna on ""Dance in the Dark"", Britney Spears on ""Telephone"", Kylie Minogue on ""Monster"", and Christina Aguilera on ""Teeth"". Yet instead of hopelessly retro, it comes off very modern, in part because U.S. pop and hip-hop is currently drawing heavily from Europop, hi-NRG, and dance music. It's almost as if we're experiencing a sonic present that's whitewashed most of the influence of backbeat sample-based hip-hop-- from Kanye and Cudi to Jason Derülo and the Black Eyed Peas, it's all presets and synths and dance. All of a sudden, Eminem's claim that ""nobody listens to techno"" seems like a hell of a long time ago.</p>
<p>Where a lot of <i>The Fame</i> felt like rote pop with overt ""comments"" on fame, Gaga's recently acquired actual fame allows her interactions with an audience to become a theatrical experience. Her music, meanwhile, has become subtler, more playful, and more well-rounded, extending the electro-pop bubble she lived in on her debut. And instead of shoehorning references to celebrity into some tracks, she's borrowing elements and templates and simply focusing on quality control. The weird result is that, despite her flitting between personalities and personas, her music feels more like her own here than it did on her debut LP. The songs feel like they were written for Lady Gaga rather than simply for any modern pop star.</p>
<p>Whether Gaga can keep up the streak is another matter. Maybe she'll get chewed up and spat out in the end, or maybe her chameleonic image changes are just Madonna's career at the speed of the Internet era and we're seeing all of her ideas at once. But all of a sudden, for a brief time at least, she's the only real pop star around.</p></div>"|13823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13823-the-fame-monster/|7.8|Scott Plagenhoef

Their pipes line the instrumental opening track of Real Estate's <i>Reality</i> EP, a quick end-of-year release that's assumed physical form just one month after the New Jersey foursome released their first (and equally loose) full-length. Weird then that a band known for taking its sweet time on tape seems to have rushed to share even more. But according to Courtney, the <i>Reality</i> EP is more a step toward starting 2010 fresh-- delivering songs either written or recorded too late to be included on their LP.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, not a lot separates the two releases sonically. If anything, Courtney's songwriting has relaxed even further. ""Motorbikes"" is anchored by Alex Bleeker's strolling bass line, while Matt Mondanile and Courtney's guitars are still plenty submerged. The racket from the titular motorcycles buzzsawing through the airspace outside the apartment that day never harshes the mellow. It's a moment that successfully bottles up the porch-swinging splendor of Real Estate's tie-dyed indie rock. But, notably, ""Motorbikes"" is the only track here on which all the band's members play together. With the added exception of ""Saturday Morning"" and Etienne Duguay's drumwork on highlight/closer ""Dumb Luck"", the rest of the <i>Reality </i>EP is the sound of Courtney working alone-- writing, recording, playing every instrument himself, harmonizing, <i>jaaaaamming</i>.</p>
<p>Real Estate songs are often mood pieces, and this set sounds much more the product of a melancholy young man ruminating on his own than any group trip to the beach. On ""Basement"", Courtney stretches his guitars over shakers, letting them yawn and sigh to sweet effect. It's become a live staple and for good reason: Despite the lyrical tug inwards, its structure and melody are wide open. The same can't be said for ""Drum"", a circular, minor-key ramble that's languid enough to sound positively clenched at times. The Mondanile-penned ""Saturday Morning"" is distinctly his own: a phaser pedal-ed paean to simple pleasures that in a way is spiritual kin to Girls' Christopher Owens' lyrical prism. Just without words. And as is the case in his Ducktails work, Mondanile's guitar licks here are at once misty and syrupy, a curtain of repeating textures that often sound like harp more than a Fender. Though it sounds and feels very much like the brainlight of another guy at the wheel, it fits. Real Estate may be Courtney's vehicle, but his bandmates speak a similar language.</p></div>"|13786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13786-reality-ep/|7.5|David Bevan

But tell that to my carbound Case Logic between 1996 and 1998, which at the time felt like its own Model UN meeting. Cibo Matto, Cornelius, and Buffalo Daughter fueled my fascination with Tokyo's short-lived Shibuya-kei scene. Air, Daft Punk, and London-based Stereolab taught me that French pop culture meant more than 1960s New Wave flicks. <i>The Score</i>'s Haitian expat hip-hop, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan bringing Sufi to the NPR crowd-- hell, even <i>Odelay </i>exoticized Americana in a way that I'd never heard before. I could go on, but I'd rather not discuss Ozomatli and <i>Buena Vista Social Club</i>.</p>
<p>None of that stuff cracked my head open in quite the same way as Cornershop's 1997 breakthrough<i> When I Was Born for the 7th Time­</i>. Tjinder Singh named his band after a bit of British racism, sang half his stuff in Punjabi-- including the snarky cover-as-cultural-reclamation project ""Norwegian Wood""-- but, along with partner Ben Ayres, loved hip-hop and Britpop just as much. <i>Born</i> was totally accessible (enough for David Byrne's Luaka Bop label, at least) but pre-Wikipedia, totally out of reach (Asha <i>who</i>?). It was quasi-political but not dogmatic, weird as shit but not ""mystical,"" sharp pop cut with extended bong-drones. Somehow, <i>Allen Ginsberg</i> showed up on this thing. By the time I was hooked, though, Cornershop had disappeared. Singh popped up in 2000 with the disco-fueled Clinton side-project, and the similarly clubby (and underrated) <i>Handcream for a Generation</i> two years later, but Cornershop's moment, like that fledgling flicker of world-weirdness in the late 90s, had more or less passed.</p>
<p>Now that it's nearly <i>expected</i> for pop to have some sort of non-Western flair, Cornershop's latest LP <i>Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast</i> feels positively quaint: Partially in comparison to its contemporaries, but partially because of the British trad-rock direction in which Singh has pushed this project. The title track, complete with a string-and-bassoon-laden arrangement, evokes Ray Davies' quirky domestic portraits with the Kinks. A cover of Manfred Mann's ""The Mighty Quinn"" induces a shrug, but the riffy, soulful (and wonderfully titled) opening track ""Who Fingered Rock'n'Roll?"" suggests Singh should play <i>Exile on Main Street</i> more. It's not clear whether the group embraced its rock leanings as a conservative reaction to his eclectic peer group, but regardless, the results can feel a bit light.</p>
<p>Yet when <i>Lemon</i> embraces Singh's intellectual side, as well as the group's more playful and political tendencies, the album shines. First single ""The Roll Off Characteristics (of History in the Making)"" is insidiously catchy (watch <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgueesvGxk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the video</a> for an instant smile)-- especially for a song that incorporates a brief spoken exegesis on the early roots of corporate globalization. Less didactic and more rock'n'roll, though, is the brief couplet early in the piece that clearly sums up the song's title: ""Winners will never be losers, and the losers will never win."" ""Operation Push"" combines a vaporous reggae rhythm and all manner of sound effects into an effervescent hybrid that simulates a walk through an open-air market (though what it says about Jesse Jackson's political coalition, I'll never know), and the ebullient fractured dub of ""Chamchu"" might be the best three and a half minutes here.</p>
<p>A large part of why ""Chamchu"" registers so strongly is that is sounds so much like <i>7th Time</i>. Considering cross-cultural musical hybridization has exponentially increased in the past decade, these sorts of ""wow"" moments are happening on an exponentially larger scale. And of course, this has also led to the sorts of controversies-- a Sri Lankan born art-school graduate making the pop hit of 2008 out of vaguely terroristic threats; an indie pop quartet regularly chastised for unironically embracing African pop-- that were stuck in Ethnomusicology seminars when Cornershop was ascendant. M.I.A. and Vampire Weekend are resented by many because, in their own way, they assume that everyone is on board with the new paradigm, and then start from there. This is exactly what Cornershop has always been so good at, and which occasionally comes through on <i>Lemon-- </i>expecting us to be on the same page, and feeling no need to explain anything to those who aren't<i>. </i>Much more than in 1997, we can't have enough artists with a global musical palette, wild imagination, and clever sense of humor-- and <i>Lemon</i> is a good start toward Cornershop's long-awaited return.</p></div>"|13813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13813-judy-sucks-a-lemon-for-breakfast/|7.3|Eric Harvey

But it's been his tireless work backing the perpetually touring Of Montreal that has put him most in the public eye, even if it involves laboring thanklessly outside the spotlight as the most normal-looking dude among Kevin Barnes' glam maelstrom.</p>
<p>Now that Husband is the name on the marquee, it's tempting to interpret his solo debut through the lens of the band for which he performs sideman duties. Look at <i>A Parallax I</i> in that light, and you can find fragments of Of Montreal's genetic material all over the place-- some overdubbed choir-of-Husbands harmonies here, a schizoid synthesizer symphony there. But where Barnes has evolved his style to a point virtually unrecognizable from the band's basement psych-pop origins, Husband shows himself to be more of an Elephant 6 traditionalist, steeping his music in Syd Barrett and Love and other late-1960s paragons.</p>
<p>Those classic Elephant 6 days were always marked by the inconsistency that tends to accompany a surplus of ideas, and Husband remains faithful to that element as well, alternating between moments that are rewarding and frustrating. The album gets off to a shaky start with the grating synth tone of ""Little Thrills"" and the mismanaged ""A Grave in the Gravel"", which wastes the album's best riff with clunky lyrics (spoiler warning: it's a pet's funeral). In other places, the unevenness accentuates the positive-- the chorus of ""Waiting on Rayne"" is as good as the clock-reading verses are irritating, and ""No No Baby"" takes forever to get going, but the synth fantasia at the end makes it worth the journey.</p>
<p>When everything really clicks on <i>A Parallax I</i>, Husband sounds less like his tour boss than another indie rock icon, Guided By Voices' Robert Pollard. Husband is a clear admirer-- a bonus covers EP that comes with the record is one-third GBV-- and the best songs here faithfully recreate the early days of the Guided By Voices catalog. It happens first on ""Elephant Alibi"", a song whose title even sounds like a Pollard tribute, and you can hear Husband asking for liberal use of the reverb knob at the offset. That mid-fi warble, so similar to the early <i>Sandbox</i> or <i>Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia</i> era of GBV, nicely infects ""While the Boys Went Down Under"" and ""Take the Train"" as well, giving both a hazy, homemade warmth that's a good fit (or less charitably, disguise) for Husband's straightforward vocals.</p>
<p>Call me old-fashioned, but it's a pleasant sacrifice of fidelity that makes Husband's songs more charming, even if some drift off into the haze (""Gray Scale"", ""The Darkestness""). Husband may struggle to get out from the shadows of his influences or his employer-- call it the sideman's curse-- but <i>A Parallax I</i> is a throwback to a handcrafted indie sound where ideas go a long way to offset a lack of identity.</p></div>"|13690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13690-a-parallax-i/|6.0|Rob Mitchum

Bo Wiget and Luigi Archetti could not have picked a more apt metaphor for their ongoing collaboration. They work exclusively in rubbish-- scraps of treated cello, guitar, and mandolin; layers of low-hertz tone and fizzing treble; sculpted interference; asphyxiated frequencies-- which their improvisational rapport turns into treasure. Their music possesses a sense of disclosure: These compositions feel like the exposed edges of vast, submerged things, soon to slip beneath the surface again.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ten years into their learning curve as a duo, Wiget and Archetti have gotten so good at listening to each other that their music feels telepathic. <i>Low Tide Digitals III</i> is the product of two minds operating as one, pursuing common goals with empathetic tension. Currents of severe modern classical, harsh noise, and ambient music pass in a fluid back-and-forth, like a comfortable but tendentious conversation between old friends. Both musicians are out-music veterans: Archetti, an Italian based in Zürich, was a member of Krautrock band Guru Guru, and Wiget, a native of Switzerland, has collaborated with many secret-stars of improv, like Taku Sugimoto. Their experience means they never have to rush or force anything; they close in on coherent themes with measured, effortless strides.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">An undulant pulse ties the pieces together, and each one is distinguished by its unique 3-D shape and finessed timbre. ""On ""Stück 26"", Wiget and Archetti gently dissect a glassy cluster of notes, gouts of dark matter spilling from the incisions. ""Stück 27"" is a huge onrushing shape, like a freight train bearing down in the darkness. The organic and electronic aren't grafted together; they're fused. Prickly strings melt into torrents of mechanical sludge, or shed pitch-bent droplets that swoop out into powerful arcs, or just flex and then roar. Wiget and Archetti exploit timbral overlaps to make noise and melody work in tandem. Or actually, more like negate each other-- social constructs like classical and experimental, organic and electronic, pretty and ugly don't appear to pertain in the private world of <i>Low Tide Digitals III</i>, an ocean built for two.</p></div>"|13569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13569-low-tide-digitals-iii/|7.7|Brian Howe

He was already responsible for four (and soon to be five) of the most WTF/OMG live TV moments of the decade: crashing Justice at an awards show (Taylor Swift would come later), his ""SNL"" freestyle, his Grammys performance, and of course, the famed Hurricane Katrina benefit. But VH1 wound up with too much of a good thing, or too much of a jaw-dropping thing: West's three-hour set had to be chopped to 90 minutes, including commercials. On record, it's all over in a little more than an hour.</p>
<p>If you've ever seen Kanye live, you know what sort of stories he tells. There are no long intros explaining the hidden meanings of his songs, or where his life was at the time he wrote them. That would be unnecessary anyway, since his bio is already so entwined into his music. Instead, Kanye delivers monologues in the middle of songs. It's less storytelling and more golden age of entertainment-type stuff, like Sinatra or Garland holding court over an audience: Here's an anecdote, here's a joke, here are some inspirational words, here's what happens to be on my mind at this very moment. Dude should have had a highball in his hand. He was already wearing a bowtie.</p>
<p>Live, West is an entertainer and a perfectionist-- a bang-for-your-buck guy. Those at this taping presumably got their money's worth, but other than the few excised morsels that leaked after the show (a long anti-Radiohead screed and a defense of Chris Brown's attack on Rihanna), we don't know what was cut. Alas, those who pick up this record get an abbreviated, neutered version. I understand the impulse: The people behind the album aren't looking to entertain us; they're looking to create a salable product. (A need that no doubt caused this to be released more than a year after it was recorded-- they were still working <i>808s</i> <i>and Heartbreak</i> back when this was taped.)</p>
<p>However it may have played in the room, breaking down a song in order to ramble doesn't make for a compelling at-home listen. The tracks here, from <i>808s</i> in particular, are well chosen-- especially underrated ones like ""Say You Will"", ""Robocop"", and ""Heartless""-- even if the album versions are vastly better. But hearing them here did make me think again about that record and hardened my belief that it will ultimately sit in West's catalog as respectfully as his first three LPs.</p>
<p>Really then, screw the songs. A better record-- albeit not a great product for those fronting the money-- would have been just the monologues. And why stop there? Why not about a best-of Kanye speaks: a <i>Having Fun With Kanye on Stage</i>, like the famous LP that collected clips of Elvis Presley talking at, rather than singing to, his audience. Hell, he's inching toward it already: <i>808s</i> ended with ""Pinocchio Song"", a long monologue, and then he released this <i>Storytellers</i> disc. Remove the talking from each, balloon it to an unreasonable, audacious, bloated level, and you've got something worth hearing at least once.</p>
<p>Granted, the highlights there might have still been the highlights here: West grappling with his old homophobia; West again explaining how badly he wishes he could experience his own live show; and the part in ""Amazing"" in which we don't get to hear him defend Chris Brown. What we do get is him saying Michael Jackson and Michael Phelps are amazing, to audience approval, and then that O.J. Simpson is also amazing, to stunned silence. Live, this section was apparently more drawn out, but on record the edits create an unintentional WTF moment when you realize Phelps is there for his transgressions rather than his accomplishments: ""Oh... he's equating a bong hit with allegations of child molestation and double homicide. Huh.""</p>
<p>On the whole, this is another example of West trying something new, willing to risk looking foolish, and reacting to the twists of turns of his life in an honest way. It's what makes him equally refreshing and frustrating. Sure, when these impulses are channeled into his more reckless blog posts or stage crashes, it makes him look like an ass. I don't care about Swift's feelings any more than I cared about Justice's-- it was just some funny shit that makes West one of our only entertaining pop stars-- but picking on a teen girl was a breaking point in the court of public opinion, and if that affects his music, I ultimately care about that. In the end, I'd trade the sideline antics that bother people for a continuation of the serious winning streak this guy is on musically. It's possible, though, that you can't have the one without the other: Like he said in ""Touch the Sky"", his wrongs help him write songs. And his songs are awesome. Just not when they're broken up by long, one-sided conversations.</p></div>"|13821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13821-vh1-storytellers/|4.9|Scott Plagenhoef

His recordings are defiantly samey, but his style is unmistakable: the horn-head/solo structure of American and European jazz applied to funk; 12-minute songs that seem to start somewhere in the middle; lots of congas, lots of honking. Something like the Nigerian James Brown, sure, but also a little like Monet's series of haystacks-- each iteration a little different but disciplined in their similarity, always some minor variation on an ideal.</p>
<p>So while two straight discs of Fela is exhausting, it's probably the most suitable way to digest him. I can't say that<i> Black President</i> (which is exactly the same as MCA's out-of-print <i>The Best of Fela Kuti</i>) contains <i>all</i> of Fela's best material-- he has too many records, and they've only been sporadically available on CD. (Knitting Factory, by the way, intends to reissue 45 of them over the next year and a half.) What I can say is that his music is so intense and consistent in mood that lesser tracks in his discography just make themselves obvious-- they don't appear hypnotized by the sprit; they lack energy. In 2006 I tried to listen to 20 Fela albums in a row and came to two conclusions: For the most part, his best songs had already made it on compilations, and that compilations best convey the full brunt of his music. There's also the issue of consumer value: Most of Fela's original albums featured only two tracks, each about 15 minutes, so a $20 compilation just gives you a lot more to chew on than a $12 album. <i>Fela: The Best of the Black President</i> isn't just a good place for someone starting out, it's probably the only Fela album many will need to own. True, some of the songs are edited, but if you need the full 15-minute version of ""Gentlemen"" instead of the 11-minute one, then the <i>Best of </i>is probably not for you in the first place.</p>
<p>Fela changed the course of funk, African music, and almost anything groove-based that came after him, but it sometimes seems like his contributions to music in general are more interesting than actually listening to his music in specific, or that the sum of his work is more exciting than any particular set of songs. It's like seeing the forest but missing the trees, or being in love with the idea of love. Or like a complaint I remember being attributed to guitarist Arto Lindsay when he was in the no-wave band DNA: That people either loved or hated them, but never talked about which songs worked or didn't. This might be a personal opinion, though-- I also find it hard to actively enjoy James Brown after two hours. At a certain point I just become passively reverent, and have a suspicion that other people do, too, unless they're dancing. (This prompts the question of Fela's utility in scenarios facilitating human propulsion to rhythm. He's useful.)</p>
<p>His biography is even more sellable-- and more bullet-point friendly-- than his music: twenty-seven wives, a commune/recording studio for his band members and family, an actively hostile relationship with Nigeria's military government. The African rebel. Even if you don't like his records, take the time to watch Stephane Tchal-Gadjieff and Jean Jacques Flori's 1982 documentary, <i>Fela Kuti: Music Is the Weapon</i>-- a real testament to the power of an artist as a political figure (quaint, I know). All to say that he's an outsized personality; a person who stands for an idea-- an icon, I guess. ""They cannot kill me, because my name is Anikulapo,"" he says in <i>Music Is the Weapon-- </i>an adopted middle name meaning, roughly, ""he who carries death in his pouch.""</p>
<p>Fela's political lyrics usually forsake subtlety for immediacy, but I find it easy to forgive him-- the soldiers who threw his mother out the window after a raid on his commune weren't very subtle either. After she died, Fela dragged a coffin to one of the army's central barracks and wrote a song about it: ""Coffin for Head of State"". His music is feverish, urgent, and simple, but it reflects on simple evils: Corruption, subjection, brutality. Of all verbs commonly used to try and convey music's intensity, I prefer ""boils"" for Fela's-- nothing abstract, just a matter of excited molecules banging against each other to produce a state simultaneously sustainable, dangerous, and transformative.</p></div>"|13660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13660-fela-the-best-of-the-black-president/|8.1|Mike Powell

Follow-up LP <i>Huntsville International</i> doesn't feel quite as risky, but in some ways it's much stronger; where the rapping on their former record occasionally felt overwhelmed by the beats' epic emotionalism, ST 2 Lettaz and Clova sound more confident, stretching out over an impressive breadth of tracks and incorporating increasingly notable guest stars like 6 Tre G and Yelawolf. The group has also managed to sidestep the trance-rap tag that had become their signature, deftly avoiding gimmickry by maintaining a creative M.O.: keep things interesting.</p>
<p>The record's most uncomfortable moments, in fact, pander to their niche; the kind of local-fanbase details that have made regional rap so evocative because of its specificity feel strangely self-conscious when rappers are shouting out bloggers and the interludes are drops from Europeans. This post-Internet internationalism feels like a hollow, awkward interaction for artists who otherwise seem so rooted in place. That said, even when they try some novel production tricks, like the spiraling EQ effects on ""What's It All About"", the first half of the record feels musically adrift. Aiming unsuccessfully for the grandiose on ""So Gone"", where the production can't quite match the rapping's all-conquering spirit, doesn't really justify its dramatic pretense.</p>
<p>It isn't until ""My Aura"" where the full breadth of the album's stylistic playfulness really takes off; the single dances with the classic Dungeon Family tension between irreverent enthusiasm and an unwillingness to be less than genuine. ""College Chicks"", similarly, is a southern rap club track in the vein of 2009 anthems like 6 Tre G and Boosie's ""Fresh"" or Young Problemz's ""Boi (I Got So Many)"", but with the kind of lighthearted goofiness that lets a rapper pull off Auto-Tune this many months after ""D.O.A."" was D.O.A. Moments later, the group flips System's timeless R&amp;B slow jam ""Don't Disturb This Groove"" into a sparkling mini masterpiece. None of these maneuvers are exactly unprecedented; part of what makes this work so well is the Block Beataz's dedication to details, the unwillingness to let a loop just be a loop. But more than that, it's the group's  aw-shucks bravery, a willingness to subvert convention without making much of a big deal about it at all, that is so intriguing.</p>
<p>The ability to take a fresh look at older approaches is most readily apparent on ""Who's Hood"". The Block Beataz take one of rap's most famous samples, originally flipped by one of the genre's most critically-beloved producers, and let it exhale into backyard southern wistfulness. It's the kind of trick that gives the entire record an aura of modest awe. At this moment, G-Side are a niche group, but more than ever this describes much of rap music. After so many years of billboard domination, hyperbole comes to rap fans easily-- after all, we're always arguing over who's the best-- but G-Side are artists who thrive in a world of decentralized discourse, who don't transcend their audience but who can upend the expectations of even the most jaded rap heads, if they give them a chance.</p></div>"|13812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13812-hunstville-international/|7.7|David Drake

<p>Dunning has released six singles in the past two years, all sparse and aggressive, all tough to categorize. I always feel like I'm tiptoeing past sleeping parents when I write about dance music, which is one of the reasons I've come to love his singles-- it's easy to imagine people who really like dance music feeling slightly confused by them, too.</p>
<p>Part of what makes his records hard to predict is that they draw on styles that don't usually end up together. There's no real regard for historical consistency, either-- something from the 80s bashes up against something contemporary before being swept away by something they'll play on the mothership after the flood. His tracks sound full in scope, but never cluttered-- most of them have only three or four things going on at any one time. That's part of his talent: He balances fluency with austerity; he knows which details bring depth and which distract.</p>
<p>The other part of what makes his records hard to predict is that he beats half his sounds unrecognizable. The combination-- a cut-up sense of history mixed with self-conscious innovation, at least on a level of sound design-- makes for tracks that are uniquely dissonant. (It's also inspired a lot of silly efforts on my part to try and verbalize what these sounds do: they suck themselves in, they flip, they fizzle and smoke, they're coming from inside the house, etc.)</p>
<p><i>Gonna Work Out Fine</i>, a new EP of six tracks, is the longest and most abrasive set he's put out yet. The minimalism in his style comes off as hyperconfidence-- about half the time, he leaves the work of the kick drum to percussive bass sounds (""drums are for pussies,"" he tweeted in June). There are no ballads or showy climaxes. The atmosphere is tense and claustrophobic, but there's always an element that lets a little steam out-- on ""Gonna Work Out Fine"", it's a corny record-scratch sound effect; on ""Stop What You're Doing"" (whose remix, by James Blake, was one of my favorite tracks of the year) it's a set of big, airy chords that unexpectedly wash over the mix and then vanish. Dunning self-identifies as a dubstep producer, but his music doesn't feel like it's pushing dubstep forward as much as exploding it.</p>
<p>If you haven't inferred the caveat that this is hardcore dance music, well: this is hardcore dance music. But if you read this website, you-- the hypothetically curious listener-- are accustomed to recommendations of Ethiopian Jazz and doom-metal, so I don't know why Untold would seem especially foreign. Whether Untold ""has something to offer a community of listeners outside the dance music world"" or some other such BS, I'm not sure-- at this point, <i>I'm</i> probably too interested in some contemporary dance music to say.</p>
<p>Then again, it's records like Dunning's-- and everything he's released on his Hemlock label, and the new directions of now-older labels like Hyperdub, and the varied post-dubstep sounds of guys like Mount Kimbie or Joy Orbison-- that have made me interested to begin with. In a recent interview with Resident Advisor, Dunning said, ""At the moment, I want to make people screwface, shout, dance weird."" It's not his most well-articulated thought, but it's probably most representative of his music-- broken and fragmented, loud and clear.</p></div>"|13770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13770-gonna-work-out-fine/|7.8|Mike Powell

Figurines and Alphabeat play garage rock like it still has something to prove. Efterklang and Mew look back even further, as if striving for the breathtaking sweep of medieval Scandinavian epics. Both of these tendencies collide in Oh No Ono, who crystallize all kinds of 1960s moon-fluff into chipper psychedelic pop. There are bold indie rock songs nestled in the volcanic special effects and choice arrangements.</p>
<p>Oh No Ono's 2008 debut album, <i>Yes</i>, emphasized grooves, like Junior Senior with more Strawberry Alarm Clock than Jackson 5 influence. <i>Eggs</i> plays down the dance beats, favoring slashing guitars, dry vocals, and stereophonic razzmatazz instead. For the detail-oriented listener who doesn't mind androgynous singing, it's a treasure trove of baroque trivia; a <i>Ripley</i>'<i>s Believe It or Not!</i> museum of sound. Marvel at the intricate pitch and tempo bends of ""Eleanor Speaks""! Thrill to the impossibly detailed <i>musique concrète </i>bridge of the Stereolab-ish ""Swim"", where birds chirp, a coin drops and clatters to a stop, something rips, and water pours, each conspicuous yet on-rhythm! On headphones, it's like <i>Avatar </i>in 3-D: You aren't always sure what the hell's going on, but you don't care because you're so immersed in the wraparound mayhem.</p>
<p>For an ""odyssey of sound""-type record, <i>Eggs </i>is admirably song-focused, and divested of any but the tastiest excesses. The timbres are varied, the melodies are broken into shards, and the drums primed for holy war-- yet all of this serves to accentuate strong through-lines, not to disguise their absence. Tower-of-light synthesizers dot ""Icicles"", throwing the rest of the song into shadow. ""The Wave Ballet""'s choral vocals confidently reach a soaring Broken Social Scene-style culmination. Throughout, the heavily treated vocals, often blended cunningly with computer-y blips and distortions, supply some genuinely catchy moments amid all the arch orchestration, especially on full-throttle rockers like ""Helplessly Young"" and ""Miss Miss Moss"". Still, this isn't the kind of stuff you're going to walk around humming. It's too weirdly shaped to really abide in you-- you have to be willing lose yourself in it instead.</p></div>"|13792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13792-eggs/|6.8|Brian Howe

Singer Ezra Koenig rhymes ""horchata"" with ""balaclava"", while keyboardist Rostam Batmanglij arranges the song around the polite plinks of marimbas. It's a sweatless calypso, buttoned-up and breezy. So, of course, haters will still find plenty to hate about <i>Contra</i>, and they'll hate it with vigor. Meanwhile, Vampire Weekend sound like they've fallen in love with what they started and are hugging it tight without shame or apology.</p>
<p>Considering the ferocious objections to Vampire Weekend's self-titled debut, ""Horchata"", and the rest of <i>Contra</i>, is brave music. It's like they've spent the past two years building a bionic version of the band-- not only brighter and tighter, but weirder. The group nurtures its eccentricities and the result is a record full of them: Ezra's stretchy, dynamic voice; Rostam's fussy but colorful arrangements, packed with lots of orchestral confetti; and a sound that spans an increasingly multicultural array of genres, from American synth-pop to reggae, ska, calypso and Afro-pop. By comparison<i>, Vampire Weekend</i><i> </i>sounds monochromatic and restrained.</p>
<p>In terms of vanguard indie bands, this makes them more digestible than Dirty Projectors but also more exciting than the relentlessly sophisticated Grizzly Bear. But <i>Vampire Weekend</i> also outsold both those bands. Their music was optioned for major-motion-picture soundtracks. They played Letterman, and Letterman didn't passively mock them. Ezra Koenig sang with Fucked Up. Later, they were in <i>Vogue</i>. They're a cross-cultural, cross-generational new indie band. <i>Contra</i>'s most sellable song, ""Giving Up the Gun"", is more polished than <i>Vampire Weekend</i>'s, but its many stranger ones are more imaginative than anything on their debut. Considering <i>Contra</i> is only their second album, they're in an enviable position: Semi-popular and sincerely idiosyncratic.</p>
<p><i>Contra</i> works because of its juxtapositions-- of natural sounds to processed ones; of manners to tantrums; of party rhythms to deadpan poetry; of black music to white music. ""Diplomat's Son"" samples M.I.A. and features an 8-bit interpolation of Toots and the Maytals' ""Pressure Drop"" amidst characters getting stoned and falling asleep in unfamiliar houses. Almost every song on the album is this rich and this delirious. And for listeners with an aversion to richness or delirium, the band still plays sweet melodies with a light touch.</p>
<p>Vampire Weekend's willingness to take cues from a variety of styles makes them thoughtful musicians, but it's the styles they draw from that makes them contemporary. Ezra Koenig once said that his clean guitar tone was a reaction to being force-fed grunge as a preteen, but he was also entering puberty when No Doubt was entering the charts, and when ska-- a sound that originated in Jamaica and became working-class British music in the 80s-- became a renewed phenomenon at teen centers across the New York metro area. Rostam Batmanglij's side project, Discovery, was an R&amp;B album made on synths and sequencers-- which, by 2009, was another synonym for ""indie rock."" Adopting what they adopt and rejecting what they reject might make Vampire Weekend look like pretenders, but they're not-- they're reactionaries.</p>
<p>Then again, these contradictions, passions, and superficialities are what the band seems to be thinking about-- and what Koenig has gotten sharper about writing into his lyrics. These lines don't scan as being about privilege or money, but about people struggling with their social status, something that everyone-- college-educated or not, rich or poor, people who hate Vampire Weekend and people who don't-- does at some point. (Though, as Pitchfork editor Scott Plagenhoef pointed out in 2008, the band's detractors probably wouldn't be nearly as hung up on Ezra's lyrics if the people in Vampire Weekend's songs-- or the people in Vampire Weekend-- seemed poor.)</p>
<p>Ezra isn't writing about college or Northeastern geography anymore (terrific), but the loud nouns are still there. Take ""California English"": ""Sweet carob rice cakes, you don't care how the sweets taste/ Fake Philly cheesesteak but you use real toothpaste/ 'Cause if that Tom's don't work, if it just makes you worse/ Would you still lose all of your faith in the good earth?"" In other words, what if all the products and symbols that gave your life meaning-- and status-- fell away? What if you replaced the organic toothpaste with Colgate? (Which still ""says something"" about you, namely ""I don't have the time, inclination, or money to give a shit about toothpaste."") Would life still look as rosy? Or, roughly, ""Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?""</p>
<p>These aren't ad-copy platitudes about the irrelevance of image-- if image didn't exist, he'd have less to write about. His point is simple: Image is important, but don't think yours is better than anyone else's, especially if it's constructed by things you buy. If Koenig has pity, it's for people who don't accept who they are off the runway, like the guy in ""Taxi Cab"": ""When the taxi door was open wide, I pretended I was horrified, by the uniform and gloves outside of the courtyard gate""-- the key word being ""pretended."" For a band as superficially calculating and antiseptic as Vampire Weekend, the message is a challenge to accept that these guys-- these very polite young east-coasters who grew up with ska, punk, and African pop-- are exactly who they say they are.</p>
<p>The album ends with ""Diplomat's Son"" and ""I Think Ur a Contra"", its two most musically scattered and lyrically opaque songs. ""Diplomat's Son""-- of the aforementioned M.I.A. sample and reggae breakdown-- is six minutes long; ""Contra"" fades to the sound of hand drums and acoustic guitars. On an album marked by ambitious, knotty lyrics, Koenig ends with the lines, ""Never pick sides, never choose between two, but I just wanted you, I just wanted you."" Commitment. Surprising, but it looks beautiful on them.</p></div>"|13807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13807-contra/|8.6|Mike Powell

Then, in November, Gucci violated again and went right back to prison for another year-long bid. That means Gucci only had about eight months of freedom in 2009. In that time he still managed to release, by my count, <i>six</i> mixtapes (including the three-in-one-day <i>Cold War</i> series) and one official album. He also found time to crank out an absurd number of guest-verses, videos, and live shows, buried a long-raging feud with Young Jeezy, and made minor stars out of proteges OJ Da Juiceman and Waka Flocka Flame. Along the way, he became rap's most divisive figure, with the internet peanut gallery lining up to call him everything from a borderline-retarded grunter to rap's last, best hope. If you followed rap in 2009, you <i>had</i> to have some opinion on Gucci. He had quite a year.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Gucci is a tough sell. The sheer volume of his output means there's no go-to entry point. He delivers all his lyrics in a marbled monotone so thick that his lyrics can be hard to make out on first listen. He never highlights his punchlines (or anything else, really); they just float by. He favors one simple, monotonic type of beat: a tense, sproingy, synth-based thing that always just sounds <i>cheap</i>. He raps way, <i>way</i> more about his cars and jewelry than anything else.</p>
<p>Over time, though, those liabilities become strengths. Because he mushmouths his punchlines so hard, you have to listen harder and more often to hear them. And it certainly helps that his punchlines are often dizzily funny and inventively intricate: ""Popping Cris, think that I need Alcohol Anonymous/ 45 in the club, I could kill a hippopotamus."" His deadpan is great for ""wait, did he really say that?"" reactions. And even if his actual delivery rarely varies, he has some bottomless number of actual flows; he attacks the beat differently on every verse, putting inflections and pauses in unexpected places and still always finding the beat's pocket. His unrelenting focus on materialistic shit rarely rankles because he's better at rapping about that stuff than just about anyone else. Both his monochromatic beats and his staggering productivity give his work a sense of immersion, hitting the same note again and again with immensely satisfying results-- like a daylong sick-day binge on James Bond movies.</p>
<p>And with Gucci, there's also a sense of shared experience. People are <i>listening</i> to this guy; he's not just another voice in the internet echo chamber. He's ascended to a very particular type of cult stardom in an age when rap stars aren't supposed to exist anymore. He's found his audience by elevating ignorance to expertly absurdist art, thus making his 2009 a worthy successor to Cam'ron's 2004 or Lil Wayne's 2005. He's been on a very, very serious roll.</p>
<p>The October DJ Drama collaboration <i>Movie 3D: The </i><i>Burrprint</i> remains the greatest of Gucci's 2009 mixtapes, in part because it's the purest example of his aesthetic. This is wheelhouse Gucci: Drug- and money-talk over simple, eerie Casio beats with no crossover attempts and almost no guest spots from rappers outside Gucci's close-knit camp. Gucci's boasts and put-downs are playful but matter-of fact throughout: ""You are not the owner of that car that is a loaner/ I got money stacks that's tall as you cause that's just my persona."" Even when he's describing crack houses in detail, he keeps telling jokes and making up goofy metaphors. There's one song about turning down ugly groupies and another about how he has to hang out with his shadow because he's so far beyond everyone else. The members of his inconsistent 1017 Brick Squad crew all nail their verses on the trio of posse cuts.</p>
<p>But the mixtape's greatest asset might be its sneakily melodic sensibility. Gucci's delivery has a casual singsong elegance that you never quite see coming, and the result means virtually every chorus is memorable-- something unthinkable from almost any other rapper. And since Gucci almost never raps over other people's beats, that means you're getting an hour's worth of full-on <i>songs</i>, something that not even Cam and Wayne offered during their peak-era runs.</p>
<p>You'd think that instinctive ear for hooks would convince Warner, Gucci's label, to let him do his thing unencumbered on the official album, <i>The State Vs. </i><i>Radric</i><i> Davis</i>. But lead single ""Spotlight"", a tone-deaf Usher collab that keeps exactly nothing of what makes Gucci likable; it had people doomsaying before the album ever came out. Mostly, though, the LP does a good job keeping Gucci's culty selling points intact on a larger stage. Regular collaborators Zaytoven and Fatboi turn in several beats each, and many of the other tracks, from name producers like Jazze Pha and Scott Storch, sound a lot like Zaytoven beats. Big-name guests like Wayne and Cam bring their A-games because they know they're dealing with a rapper on their level.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Gucci maintains his singular weirdness throughout. He keeps finding unexpected ways to say the same stuff: ""I be runnin' gunnin' stunnin' with a hundred killers <i>riiiiiidin</i>'/ And you snitchin' bitchin' tattle tellin' and scared to stand <i>besiiiiiide</i> me."" He says some stuff that barely makes sense: ""Eat rappers like Jeffrey Dahmer/ Dope color Sinead O'Connor."" He has one song about wearing all-yellow everything and another where guest crooner Bobby Valentino offers to fuck you in front of your father. He sings the chorus of Amy Winehouse's ""Rehab"" mid-verse. There are a few missteps, like the run of mid-album R&amp;B tracks that saps some momentum. But the LP has a energy rare to major-label rap efforts. Like Wayne's <i>Tha Carter II</i>, it translates Gucci's mixtape triumphs into something more digestible and immediate.</p>
<p>Of course, the album came out when Gucci was back in prison and sold way fewer copies than expected. Gucci's detractors took the opportunity to declare his regional stardom a grand illusion. Those detractors should take a good, hard listen to the late-album track ""Worst Enemy""-- a rare introspective moment where Gucci extends something resembling an olive branch to Jeezy and frankly discusses his own self-destructive tendencies, all without compromising his dense, frantically hopscotching sense of wordplay. So: When he feels like it, Gucci can talk about serious matter with the same infectious verve that he uses to call your jeweler a loser. Artistically, at least, he's just getting started. And now that he's going to be locked up for a while, the world has a chance to catch up.</p></div>"|13793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13793-the-burrprint-the-movie-3-d-the-state-vs-radric-davis/|8.4|Tom Breihan

Big-name guests like Wayne and Cam bring their A-games because they know they're dealing with a rapper on their level.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Gucci maintains his singular weirdness throughout. He keeps finding unexpected ways to say the same stuff: ""I be runnin' gunnin' stunnin' with a hundred killers <i>riiiiiidin</i>'/ And you snitchin' bitchin' tattle tellin' and scared to stand <i>besiiiiiide</i> me."" He says some stuff that barely makes sense: ""Eat rappers like Jeffrey Dahmer/ Dope color Sinead O'Connor."" He has one song about wearing all-yellow everything and another where guest crooner Bobby Valentino offers to fuck you in front of your father. He sings the chorus of Amy Winehouse's ""Rehab"" mid-verse. There are a few missteps, like the run of mid-album R&amp;B tracks that saps some momentum. But the LP has a energy rare to major-label rap efforts. Like Wayne's <i>Tha Carter II</i>, it translates Gucci's mixtape triumphs into something more digestible and immediate.</p>
<p>Of course, the album came out when Gucci was back in prison and sold way fewer copies than expected. Gucci's detractors took the opportunity to declare his regional stardom a grand illusion. Those detractors should take a good, hard listen to the late-album track ""Worst Enemy""-- a rare introspective moment where Gucci extends something resembling an olive branch to Jeezy and frankly discusses his own self-destructive tendencies, all without compromising his dense, frantically hopscotching sense of wordplay. So: When he feels like it, Gucci can talk about serious matter with the same infectious verve that he uses to call your jeweler a loser. Artistically, at least, he's just getting started. And now that he's going to be locked up for a while, the world has a chance to catch up.</p></div>"|13793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13793-the-burrprint-the-movie-3-d-the-state-vs-radric-davis/|8.0|Tom Breihan

Trust that there's a reason for it; not only are Wasif's hired hands steady and limber no matter the situation, but over the course of a couple of solo albums, Wasif hasn't done much to distinguish himself from the impressive company he's kept. With <i>The Voidist</i>, however, Wasif's made a nimble, grandiose album all his own, one that feels like a move towards his own spotlight.<br/><br/>Whereas his texture-heavy previous solo work has often felt a bit shy of things like, er, songs, <i>The Voidist</i> is a relatively grandiose affair, drawing on the widescreen sound of 1990s Radiohead and the more ambitious later Led Zeppelin stuff. But despite its outsizes ambitions, <i>The Voidist</i> feels deeply personal and intensely focused, the epic construction of its tracks tempered by the economy of their arrangements and Wasif's hypnotic, Jeff Buckley-indebted voice. From the swarming brood of tone-setting opener ""Redeemer""-- ""I got a bad mood that precedes me,"" Wasif confides, not that it wouldn't be apparent from all the solemn yearning that follows it-- to the ruddy, thunderous closer ""Razorlike"" (jokin' on Johnny Borrell, is he?), the dynamic, deliberate <i>Voidist </i>contains multitudes.<br/><br/>Though Wasif's come a long way as a songwriter, his axework is still very much at the center of <i>Voidist</i>; the slate grey of his tightly wound tunes colored over by sharp shocks of neon from his guitar. It's easy to picture Wasif on the cover of some gearhead rag, seven-stringer in hand, but <i>Voidis</i><i>t</i>'s more than just a fix for tone junkies. The easy ballast of bleary, very <i>Bends-</i>y ""Priestess"" does a whole swath of Jonny Greenwood acolytes a few better by keeping things simple, while the meandering folk-pop of ""The Hand of the Imposter (Is the Promise of My Own)"" and ""Her Sorcery"" feel deceptively complex, revealing more and more over time. Highlights abound, but it's the beyond-""Kashmir"" of the back half of ""Return to You"" that serves as the elliptical <i>Voidist</i>'s centerpiece, a slab of shoestring-epic bombast that marks the perfect collusion of Wasif's cosmic craving and newly-honed prosaic prowess. There were times throughout Wasif's prior solo work when it seemed the center couldn't hold, but each tune on <i>Voidist</i> feels intricately mapped out around this highest of high points.<br/><br/>Wasif's a slightly inscrutable lyricist, heavy on the hankering but without much indiction as to the source of said languish. As such, while it's easy to fall under <i>Voidist</i>'s spell, its meanings can be a little tough to parse; one pictures Wasif staring off into the middle distance, seeing things words aren't always apt to describe. That feeling of being held at arm's length persists no matter how much time you put in with <i>Voidist</i>, and it's the record's only significant shortcoming. Still, one presumes with a little more time adjusting to the light, Wasif will open up a bit; for now, it's plenty just to sit and listen to <i>T</i><i>he Voidist</i> unfurl.</p></div>"|13804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13804-the-voidist/|7.7|Paul Thompson

This is great news if you grew up on this sort of thing, and even better if you've come to the point that you'd rather have your ears drilled than hear another new band that could be described as ""angular."" Grooms, a New York City-based trio previously known as the Muggabears, have been ahead of this curve for some time now, playing arty, Sonic Youth-derived rock music for several years to modest blog acclaim.</p>
<p>Grooms have never been tremendously charismatic or distinctive, but they are thoughtful, skilled musicians who excel at building intricate compositions that come over as loose and casual. While fellow New Yorkers and 90s rock torchbearers Cymbals Eat Guitars shoot for the moon with ambitious epics like ""...And the Hazy Sea"", Grooms go to a far more relaxed zone with their churning chords and tangled arpeggios. The music is dramatic and potentially crowd-pleasing, but the songs sound like the work of a band that has long since stopped caring about anyone's pleasure but its own.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the wonderful thing about <i>Rejoicer</i>, the band's debut under the Grooms name, is that it's not actually insular and closed-off.  There's an obvious thrill in the way the band members connects with one another, locking into grooves and following one another on tangents, and that transfers over to the listener. It all seems very composed and refined, but the best moments come out sounding like spontaneous epiphanies, and you can just imagine them nodding to each other approvingly across their rehearsal space as they snap into particularly exciting sequences.</p>
<p>At times, the musicianship gets ahead of the songwriting. The opening number ""Dreamsucker"" is a revelation -- dynamic, hooky, energetic! -- but the discipline on evidence in that song is lacking on less engaging tracks like ""Ghost Cat"" and ""She-Bears"", which both lean too heavily on drone and ambiance. Atmosphere is not exactly the band's strong suit. They come up with some nice noises and textures, but those sounds are far more effective when they bring character to melodic and rhythmic motifs, as on ""Thumbs"" and ""CJ"". <i></i></p>
<p><i>Rejoicer</i> is a quality album with some especially strong tracks, but as much as it is refreshing to hear a relatively young band nail sounds from a previous era, the record is more enjoyable than it is interesting. Sure, you could sit around dissecting it, figuring out what bits are more Sonic Youth, or more Dinosaur Jr. or Helium or Polvo or Gastr Del Sol, and on and on, but you'd have a very hard time isolating what makes this music distinctly Grooms-ian. The band have made a significant leap on this album as musicians, hopefully they will soon find their voice as songwriters.</p></div>"|13787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13787-rejoicer/|6.4|Matthew Perpetua

He's a regular on that imprint's annual <i>Pop Ambient</i> compilation but moved a few years back to New York's Anticipate for his full-lengths, starting with 2008's heavily processed drone suite <i>Dedications</i>. The final track on that record, ""For Steven Spielberg &amp; Azza El-Hassan"", explored cinematic sweep and the notion of film music as home listening, and with his most recent release <i>Movies Is Magic</i>, Meissner applies that idea to an entire LP.<br><br>A high-concept piece, <i>Movies Is Magic</i> deals directly with the transportive nature of movie music, its ability to enhance a visual experience or add depth to a story. In some sense it's a film score without a film, and how much you buy into the academic narrative behind it-- the album comes equipped with a lengthy essay, penned by Meissner, detailing its relationship to the writing of Slovenian film theorist Slavoj Zizek-- will likely impact what you take away from its songs. Each of the record's tracks, which range from anxious, slow-moving ambient pieces to pastoral modern-classical drifts, seem built with an imaginary movie sequence in mind, and some are more successful than others at conjuring the feeling of losing yourself in a dark cinema.<br><i><br>Movies Is Magic</br></i> is unlike a good portion of ambient-techno records in that it mostly eschews the genre's usual vaporous bliss in favor of much gloomier tones. It's dark and cold and the prevailing sentiments are menace and dread. (One gets the sense that if <i>Movies Is Magic</i> were actually a film, it would look something like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICp4g9p_rgo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Let the Right One In</i></a>.) But Klimek does his best work in these shadowy areas, on songs like ""Abyss of Anxiety (Unfolding the Magic)"", a glittering drone number wound tight with tension. These ominous moments overlap with his attempts at visual storytelling, and though not always successful, it's easy to hear in the rolling drums and Morricone-referencing arrangement of ""Pathetic &amp; Dangerous"", for instance, that Klimek is setting the stage for a spaghetti western-style shootout.<br><br>If there's a central problem with <i>Movies Is Magic</i>, though, it's that it feels too much like a film score and not enough like an album. Which is to say that some of its tracks sound like background music, good in a supporting role but without the weight to stand on their own. That's true with ""A Lament"", which comes across slight and transitional, and the pleasant-but-forgettable ""For Whom the Bells Toll"". These uneven moments put on display the record's overemphasis of concept, and perhaps worse, keep Klimek from enchanting his listener in the way the best movies can.</br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|13806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13806-movies-is-magic/|6.3|Joe Colly

And then he basically took 2009 off-- relatively speaking, at least. He still grossed about $42 million in worldwide ticket sales, released two stellar mixtapes (<i>Hottest Nigga Under the Sun</i> and <i>No Ceilings</i>), and was the subject of one of the more fascinating music documentaries in recent memory, <i>The Carter</i>. (I'm just going to pretend to ignore his forever-delayed dalliance into mook-rock, <i>Rebirth</i>, for the time being.)</p>
<p>But without new tracks and features hitting the web every week, it did seem like Wayne was M.I.A. He had spoiled us. And that missing feeling tugged harder when he pled guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon in October, a blunder that could put him in a New York jail for a year starting next month, when he's due to be sentenced. These dire circumstances loom over <i>We Are Young Money</i>, the first album from Wayne's cobbled-together hip-hop clique-- can his pupils come close to filling the creative vacuum left by their frighteningly prodigious mentor? Crazily enough, a couple of them just might be able to pull it off.</p>
<p>Though Puff Daddy and the Family's pioneering 1997 boomtime opus <i>No Way Out</i> still boasts the greatest number of contributing stars-- Biggie, Mase, Lil' Kim, the L.O.X.-- when it comes to the single-ego-fueled-rap-crew-album genre, most of the time, side players have little chance of becoming anything but. Consider the sorry track record of Eminem's D-12, 50 Cent's G-Unit, Ludacris's Disturbing Tha Peace, or Young Jeezy's U.S.D.A. Even Jay-Z's most overt clique record, 2000's <i>The Dynasty: Roc La Familia</i> couldn't bolster main contributors Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek to much past staunch regional kudos. Last decade, Cam'ron was one of the more successful kingpins, with the 2003 album <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i> spawning semi-careers for Juelz Santana and Jim Jones before Dipset forgot why they were great and imploded. And while <i>We Are Young Money</i> undoubtedly marks a career high for most of Wayne's crew, there are two contributors who have an excellent chance of jumping out from behind their teacher's shadow.</p>
<p>Drake is already there. After smashing with lover-not-fighter anthem ""Best I Ever Had"" and sussing out the logical continuation of Kanye West's <i>808s and Heartbreak</i> sound with his <i>So Far Gone</i> mixtape last year, the singer/rapper's forthcoming major label debut LP is the uncontested Most Anticipated Hip-Hop Bow of 2010. And for good reason-- more than competitors like Kid Cudi and Wale, Drake has the sensitivity, wit, and commercial wherewithal to create the breakout album hip-hop fans longed for, and didn't get, in 2009. His encroaching stardom probably hurts <i>We Are Young Money</i> as an album-- he seems to be saving his signature Auto-Hooks for the solo LP-- but his four verses act as apt teasers, highlighted by a melodic and horny masterclass on ""Every Girl"" and an anchor lap on ""Pass the Dutch"", where he boasts: ""I told you catch up, did you make a mil yet?/ I can't predict how many of 'em I can still get."" Could be quite a few.</p>
<p>The other current YM bold face is 25-year-old Queens native Nicki Minaj. A vixen with outlandish curves and a flow that pings between valley girl sex goddess and cartoon thug, Minaj could probably carpet-bomb hip-hop mag covers no matter her skills on the mic. Thankfully, she's much more than a pair of boutique high heels and a dirty mouth-- in fact, with her five <i>WAYM</i> verses, Minaj is the most consistent (and consistently amusing) MC on the entire album. She's as outrageously raunchy as vintage Lil' Kim (""flow tighter than a dick in a butt"") and as randomly hilarious as, um, Lil Wayne (""Switch my name, now I'm celebratin' Hanukkah/ Lewinsky, bitches, Young Money Monica/ I been hot since Hedgehog-- Sonic, the""). Like Drake, her 2009 mixtape, <i>Beam Me Up Scotty</i>, was a powerful opening salvo, and-- considering recent collaborations with Usher, Robin Thicke, and Mariah Carey-- Minaj has the potential to become the first new out-and-out female rap star in years.</p>
<p>In between appearances from Drake, Minaj, and Wayne-- who offers lukewarm verses and/or deranged-but-palatable Auto-Tune hooks on most tracks-- a slew of numbskulls, weirdos, and little kids sometimes make things interesting. On the bonehead front are Gudda Gudda, Mack Maine, and onetime Dipset pal Jae Millz, who show up a lot but have comically little to say. (Sample Mack Maine brain fizzle: ""We on some other shit/ They on the same shit/ I'm Mack Maine/ I'm Mack Maine, bitch!"") There's an awful singer (Atlanta-based Shannell), an awkward emo refugee (Tyga, who's the cousin of Gym Class Heroes leader Travis McCoy), and a couple of screechy voiced teens whose contributions are mercifully kept to a minimum. Along with its top tier talents, what keeps <i>WAYM</i> from slogging along is a stylistic diversity and a selection of beats that sometimes borders on phenomenal.</p>
<p>Unlike most rap crews, YM features artists from all across the continent and not just one regional enclave, so even when the lesser lights take over, at least they don't sound exactly like each other. Meanwhile, upstart producers Chase N. Cashe and Kane Beatz keep things moving sonically, whether it's CNC's baroque, Grizzly Bear-esque (!) beat for ""New Shit"" or Beatz's bright and haughty instrumental for the hit ""Bedrock"", which wouldn't sound out of place on a Wes Anderson hip-hop movie score (not to say that should ever exist, necessarily). But reliable Southern stalwart David Banner takes best beat honors with his absolutely-evil subwoofer mulcher ""Streets Is Watchin'"". It's a shining moment from an album that signals hope for Lil Wayne's collective enterprise even during his imminent state-sanctioned breather.</p></div>"|13810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13810-we-are-young-money/|7.4|Ryan Dombal

Perhaps it's the three wolves stalking its cover, the threatening title appropriately scrawled above in a slanted, action-film font. Or it could simply be the music, which doles out new anxieties with each turn: The harsh noise and dissonant strings lashing above and around the beat of ""Peter Venkman Pt. I"". Or, on ""Leo Needs a New Pair of Shoes"", where howling wolves surround and overtake the rustle of a gentle chamber ensemble. Wolves again harmonize against the screech of a violin on ""The Carpathians"". From aggressive visage to animal vocals, <i>By the Throat</i> is, as another reviewer said, ""dread-inducing music.""</p>
<p>No equivocation necessary, <i>By the Throat</i> is a sinister album, full of moments that rattle cores with sound (play it loud) and sound effects (beware those wolves). But Frost's work is more than a hall of terrors: These vivid instrumentals, which seem menacing at first, also feel somehow triumphant when heard again-- new details becoming more crucial. <i>By the Throat</i> might frighten on the first listen, and it might shock by the 12th. But, somewhere in between, Frost-- both a compelling new musical dramaturge and arranger-- might just show you the silver lining of all these fears.</p>
<p>Blending <i>musique concrète</i> samples with exorbitant electronic production and the guest work of string quartet Amiina and composer Nico Muhly, Frost pulls ideas from sources far and wide-- his instrumental work bears traces of radio rock, heavy metal, rap. The closing triptych moves between metal, dark-wave, hip-hop, and harsh-noise influences, cycling them all through a bustle-and-collapse template that has as much to do with Aphex Twin as it does experimental composer Anton Webern. So, if ""Through the Glass of the Roof"" first sounds like a busted jungle track, it sounds more like black metal deliverance by the time ""Through the Roof of Your Mouth"" begins. That midsection, in turn, suggests Cluster, Radiohead, and Merzbow. And when it collapses into a sheet of harsh noise, Frost restores the bassline for the finale, ""Through the Mouth of Your Eye"". He isolates the bass, slows it down and eventually lets it drift away under cover of a few shrieking string parts, again deflecting the question of what matters most.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the push and pull between muted triumph and tempered menace more apparent than on ""Peter Venkman Pts. I and II"", named for Bill Murray's <i>Ghostbusters</i> character. During ""Pt. I"", a chorus of horns and voices rise and fall through that razing static, moving in uneven arcs through broken rhythms. In ""Pt. II"", though, the voices grow and overcome the noise. The horns stretch out like steady winds, sometimes foreboding and low; loops of dulcimers, banjos, and bells float over the long tones, battling through wolf growls and bass throbs to float, at last, above the horns. Frost leaves it to the audience to pick favorites and winners.</p>
<p>Listeners often relegate instrumental music into a series of intrinsic, reductive modifiers-- a drone is meditative, you know, and harsh noise is just mean. Post-rock is cinematic and sweeping, while finger-picked acoustic guitar music is nostalgic and ruminative. Unfairly, pop songs alone get the privilege of simultaneous juxtaposition. That is, Elliott Smith and Brian Wilson can sing heartbreaking words above bright, shining music, and we laud its bittersweet complexity. But when's the last time you heard someone argue for ecstatic noise (consider Fuck Buttons) or busy drones (see Rhys Chatham's <i>A Crimson Grail</i>)? Probably never. <i>By the Throat</i> demands those kinds of complex distinctions, though. Its radiance is a dark one, and its most sinister moments lead to deliberate calm.</p></div>"|13809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13809-by-the-throat/|8.4|Grayson Currin

Their lone album, <i>Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth</i>, is a soul obscurity revered by DJs and a certain stripe of crate digger. It was an expensive record to make, and it's safe to say it didn't recoup, flopping big time on its release in 1973. One wonders if anyone, including the band's leader, Dale Warren, expected it to succeed. It's a desolate, bleak concept record about ghetto life with virtually no pop moves and plenty of sermonizing about socio-economics. Not a recipe for chart-busting.</p>
<p>There's something very of its time about 24-Carat Black. They were a kind of loose collective in the early 1970s, a moment when the Civil Rights movement had achieved most of its tangible goals and had to contend with harder things than laws, like ingrained prejudice and systemic inequality. <i>Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth</i> was a record that spoke to the moment, but unfortunately spoke to almost no one. Even as Stax foundered and his record disappeared without a trace, Warren kept the band going, recording with two different lineups (one with 13 members, the second with 14 members) for the next couple of years in an attempt to craft a suitable follow-up. He made about 20 recordings, of which only six survive today-- the Numero Group guys found them by accident, cleaned them up and sequenced them like a 24-Carat Black sophomore album that never was.</p>
<p>From the 37 minutes of music here, Warren seems unperturbed by the first LP's commercial demise. He's moved on from the ghetto narratives and songs of struggle on <i>Misfortune's Wealth</i>, dipping back to reinvent a few songs he'd written for other Stax acts in the 60s and moving forward with new ones built around romantic relationships. Here he's exploring desire and heartbreak with the same ear for lonely desperation, fluid arrangements and restraint that he showed on the band's album. It grooves, but not in a dancefloor sense-- ""I Don't Love You"" has a funk-spiked jazz underpinning, with lots of lead sax to back Princess Hearn's chilly soul wail. He brings the easy soul groove of ""I'll Never Let You Go"" to a simmering climax, only to drop the rhythm for the cooing, oohing, aahing breakdown, supplying what could have been a gooey sex jam with a cold, minimal backing. It's totally counterintuitive, but it works. The singer is sultry and desirous, but also possessive and demanding-- a valediction of the fact that love gone bad can still feel uncannily good.</p>
<p>Love's just gone bad on ""I Want to Make Up"", a desolate duet of sorts that finds the female singer sparring with a spoken male vocalist who coldly dismisses her, walking out as the song ends, leaving her with just a few spectral harmonies for company. ""The Best of Good Love Gone"" is nearly a straightforward 70s soul song, with Jamerson-style bass and great, subtle drumming, but it cops a lot from jazz and psychedelia, taking on a character of its own that's clearly 70s, but has aged quite well. The epic closer, ""I Begin to Weep"", opens with funky choral grandeur, but collapses in a heap seven minutes in, leaving vocalist Robert Dunson to wander through a landscape of droning organ, whispering and mumbling to himself as drums call out into the emptiness with repeated patterns.</p>
<p>Warren's music could be high-concept, but unlike 24-Carat Black's one true album, this stuff is approachable on a purely emotional level. In some senses, <i>Gone: The Promises of Yesterday</i> bests <i>Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth</i>, but the two records are ultimately too dissimilar for a direct comparison to be of much use, especially considering how few people have actually heard <i>Misfortune's Wealth</i>. As a sort of long-delayed follow-up, this disc delivers easily, and it's bound to please fans of early-70s conscious soul-- think Isaac Hayes, Boscoe, the Pharaohs, Black Renaissance, and even the Temptations  to get your bearings. Then dive into the singular musical world of Dale Warren. It's an interesting place, even after all those years of moldering in the basement.</p></div>"|13779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13779-gone-the-promises-of-yesterday/|7.9|Joe Tangari

It's not overly declarative or pushy-- in fact, there's a feeling of uncertainty in its delivery that asks you to step back for a minute and give the statement a fair once-over. For a San Franciscan four-piece that churns out the same kind of sharp, garage-minded jangle-pop as a lot of their fellow Left Coasters, it's a perfectly reasonable defense mechanism. Of course this kind of stuff matters to people on some level, and if the Mantles are ultimately fishing for a compliment, I'll give them this: Most of <i>The Mantles</i> is much tighter and more athletic than stuff you'd traditionally find in this vein of late, with nearly every groove-furnished, guitar-spiked rumbler feeling more taut and refined with each listen. A lot of the talk about this band contains references to the Chills or the Dream Syndicate, and while a cursory listen will be able to dig that stuff up pretty quickly, most of the Mantles' debut packs more of a punch, as the Radio Birdman-propulsed ""What We Do Matters"" suggests. Pretty soon, the question has little to do with what matters-- they should've just had the balls to tell us that what they do is good.</p>
<p>Most of these songs do hinge on some Paisley Underground staples, leaving C-list cuts like the wandering ""Burden"" to be forever condemned to burn in Brian Jonestown Massacre demo hell. But with most of the livelier material, it's pretty clear that the Mantles are a band with a real set of teeth. ""Yesterday's Gone"", a psych-revved splash of Motor City thrash, boorishly boosts the infamous riff from ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" while still retaining the grit and reinforcing the groove. Shaggy opener ""Disappearing Act"" can't help but interject surf's-up guitar licks, and even on the mid-tempo ""Look Away""-- nicely padded with organ hum and a little pissed-off soul balladeering-- the song grinds to a near halt so the band can twist it into a desperate flop-around. It's these welcome spurts of primal boogie that afford some of the lighter fare an honest sense of drama.</p>
<p>The more dangerous themes become more and more apparent at almost every turn, as the titular theme of the sock-hoppy single ""Don't Lie"" feels less like a sad-sack plea and more like some weirdly formidable domestic warning. But read too much into anything on <i>The Mantles</i> and you'll run the risk of missing much of the purely pleasurable moments that require little effort to realize. Even with forgettable material, like the too-aptly titled closer ""Thin Reminder"", it's hard not to just plain enjoy these breeze-kissed tunes. In that respect, it's pretty easy to understand why these small fish are asking for that tiny bit of reinforcement in their big pond: ""If you don't think so, take a good look around."" It's only natural to feel a little bogged-down by your own niche constraints, but it really matters only if what you do works. Here, the Mantles have proved they have little to worry about.</p></div>"|13796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13796-the-mantles/|6.8|Zach Kelly

That's amazing. At the time his instrument was crafted, our country hadn't yet experienced Pearl Harbor. As grim retrospectives are still stacking up, it's still weird to look back on the 2000s as a time defined in any way by <i>Kid A</i> or <i>Is This It </i>as much as towers falling or bubbles bursting-- most of the time it felt as if our popular culture was detached and separate from the actual realities of our times. Laarks, a foursome from Northern Wisconsin, seem to have sifted through the past 10 years of sound, homing in specifically on 00s indie rock moments that somehow feel increasingly distant. Perhaps even more than 1990s indie touchstones do at the moment.</p>
<p><i>An Exaltation of Laarks</i>, the band's debut LP, neither pushes any envelopes nor changes any games. It is, however, a well-crafted document of a time period we're still in the process of digesting. As opener ""What God Hath Wrought"" kicks things off over some synth and sleigh bells, everything feels both deliciously familiar and weirdly dated. Frontman/keyboardist/head songwriter Ian Jacoby's papery yelp is a near dead ringer for that of the Promise Ring's Davey van Bohlen (also a fellow a Wisconsinite) just as Kyle Flater's lead guitar hook is yanked straight out of a Killers single. Though the synthetic/organic bent is a little overdone at times, the gap traversed between those two reference points is comforting in a geeky, sincere kind of way. There's a lot of fun to be had in picking out Laarks' influences track by track, layer to layer. The first few seconds of ""The S Stood For Science"" maintain a whir and thrum that's pure Broken Social Scene. Couldn't be anyone else. Minutes later it charges into a stomach-churning coda with shades of Death Cab for Cutie at their most taut. Interpol? Yeah, they're in there, too.</p>
<p>Let's face it: None of this would require repeated listens were the melodies non-existent or the execution flat. But these songs have great energy. Though Laarks have re-assembled ""indie"" parts and atmospherics moms can now recognize, they've done it all with a fizz and punch that's clearly their own. Moen (formerly of Eau Claire heroes Amateur Love and DeYarmond Edison) is an absolute mammoth with drumsticks in his hands and gives every number real verve, no matter the volume, vibe, or tempo. ""Where Do You Wanna Live?"" in particular showcases a fantastic stretch in which he swaps out a drum machine for his own rolls without so much as a seam. And although Jacoby tends to pickle some areas of the record with hiccuped synths (""You Know They Do"") and Win Butler-like vocal ticks better off avoided (""Telephone""), he lends that same song a real sense of place, politely repeating, ""Tell me where you wanna live? Milwaukee or Eau Claire? Tell me where do you wanna live, when you grow up?"" It's a moment of searching, of looking afield. Into the future.</p></div>"|13743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13743-an-exaltation-of-laarks/|6.6|David Bevan

At the very least, it's one of the album's most attention-grabbing cuts. J Dilla's hauntological tour of the 2000s' second half manifested itself here as a fused-together unearthing of two of his archived beats: the organ-driven psych-soul ""Dig It"" and the ""Return of the 'G'""-gone-lo-fi Moroderisms of ""Phantom of the Synths"". DOOM united those two movements with a tour de force rendition of his characteristic hookless, free-associative pop-culture cliché-disemboweling that stands up to any of the top three verses on <i>Madvillainy</i>. And even through the rawness, he rode on that beat so securely that even without the Dilla shoutouts it'd be a fool's errand to separate his voice from it.</p>
<p>Not that Thom Yorke or Dave Sitek or Jneiro Jarel are fools, of course-- it's just that they have their work cut out for them when it comes to remixing this song. The <i>Gazzillion Ear </i>EP includes the Yorke remix that accompanied the iTunes release of <i>Born Like This</i>, a collaboration between Sitek and Jarel, and another Jarel mix created under his ""Dr. Who Dat?"" guise. The EP also includes the original track, largely for completion's sake, and a brief, shrugworthy bonus beat entitled ""The.Green.Whore.Net""; it's probably for the best that most people who already own <i>Born Like This </i>(by which I mean pretty much anyone who would already be interested in ""Gazzillion Ear"" in any context) can pick this one up piecemeal.</p>
<p>While Yorke's remix doesn't supplant the original, it doesn't bother to try-- in fact, it doesn't even use the same vocal track. DOOM's flow on the Yorke remix is both faster-spitting and more intense, a reserved yet intimidating raspiness on some Clint Eastwood business. It's also split up, giving his lyrics some breathing room, but part of the appeal of ""Gazzillion Ear"" is that DOOM just goes nonstop, so hearing his voice drop out every so often to let Yorke's distantly twitching, wordless-murmur ambience burble for a moment sabotages the momentum. And as much promise as that skittering, icy beat holds, it sounds way too ghostly and mournful to back up a verse featuring namedrops of ""The Gong Show"" and <i>Ernest Goes to Camp</i>.</p>
<p>Jarel's two contributions make a lot more sense, since they capture the lyrics' menacing/absurd split personality in their own unique language. Given the advanced age of the Yorke remix, the Jarel/Sitek teamup is the blockbuster draw on this EP, and it doesn't disappoint. They pull a neat trick of turning Dilla's lifted keyboard melodies inside out and echoing it loosely with a burbling sound somewhere between highlife guitars and late-60s analog electronics, throwing in some truncated blasts of halfway-Afrobeat brass that eventually spill out into an invigorating horn outro. But it's Jarel's other contribution that steals the show: the Dr. Who Dat? mix is boom-bap that breathes through deep, thrumming digital bass, riding on zone-out synths and hi-hats that melt and freeze into crystalline sonics. He's done something better than distracting listeners from how great the original version is-- he's provided a good reason to speculate what DOOM might sound like over more beats like this.</p></div>"|13800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13800-gazzillion-ear-ep/|7.2|Nate Patrin

<p class=""MsoNormal"">But even if El-P and Young Jeezy are the battle lines upon which ideological wars about what constitutes ""real"" hip-hop are fought, wouldn't it be worthwhile to see if there's any crossover between each's unique and impactful take on urban dystopia?<span> </span>They're both really good at what they do-- it's worth a shot.<span> </span>But is it worth a listen?<span> </span>Well, <i>ATL RMX's </i><span>first track, Jeezy's ""I Got This (El-P Remix)"" bangs like crazy, but it does so in a weirdly individualized way.<span> </span>It takes a monster of a beat to make Jeezy sound overwhelmed, and his boasts end up as a nearly incidental sound effect under all those clip-emptying drums and enjambed female vocal interjections (this mixtape appears to exist only as a ""clean version""... that doesn't necessarily help).<span> </span>I'd love to hear more, but maybe if Jeezy heard the beat first?<span> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Still, <i>ATL RMX </i><span>starts out strong:<span> </span>DJA adds a buzzier backing track to Rich Kids' ""Patna Dem"", but it's the irrepressibly emphatic chanting that's going to sell it every time.<span> </span>""Imma G"" has a strangely sweet and sour tropical taste and essentially becomes a typical Memory Tapes track by its midway point, suggesting Dayve Hawk has incorporated more hip-hop into his sound than he's often given credit for.<span> </span>There's also honest to god rapping from Cee-Lo.<span> </span>If that doesn't justify this mixtape's completely nonexistent download cost, I don't know what to tell you.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But elsewhere, the remixers seem compelled to justify their existence/appearance in ways that rarely do any favors to the source material.<span> </span>I suppose SALEM's reverence for both Chapterhouse and Swishahouse will pay off someday, but their decision to chop and screw Playboy Tre's subdued, lyrically potent sipper's lament ""Sideways"" feels like a misunderstanding of the material at best and a joke at worst-- the last interpretation this sort of thing needs.<span> </span>Many have remarked upon the influence of rave music on Lil' Jon's mid-decade work, but matched up with the BPMs and sinus-eroding coke bump of Danger Beach's ""Give It All You Got"" remix, he hardly sounds revitalized or even relevant.<span> </span>And if HEALTH truly want to make an impact in hip-hop, they'll let M.O.P. spit flame over ""Die Slow"", because that shit knocks.<span> </span>Their pounding, dissonant remake of OJ Da Juiceman's ""Good Night"" should be enough to really make M.I.A. rethink boasting her upcoming album as a crit-wank fantasy of Animal Collective-meets-Gucci Mane.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But even when <i>ATL RMX </i><span>fails, it represents a discussion worth having-- though OJ Da Juiceman getting booed at a CMJ showcase served as a flashpoint, it was less ""OutKast gets booed at the Source Awards"" than ""Philadelphia Eagles fans boo Santa Claus,"" an understandable reaction (it was a skinny, poorly dressed Santa/I didn't hear Pill or Curren$y getting booed) with understandable timing (the Eagles were blowing a chance to get the #1 pick, oddly enough, O.J. Simpson/it was hours into a rap show running impossibly late on a Wednesday night) that made an audience with an already hostile rep look irreparably bad.<span> </span>No one comes out looking good, especially in the wake where sides are too easily taken, when hip-hop is considered a zero-sum game where only one region or mindset can be ""right"" and enjoyed only for the right ""reasons.""<span> </span>But is it worthwhile at all to wonder if Scott Herren enjoys Shawty Lo ""legitimately"" or whether it's ""correct"" to finally give Gucci Mane a shot only because he's being remixed by Flying Lotus (or vice versa)?<span> </span>Hell, most of hip-hop listening these days seems to revolve around conversation anyway, so let's keep it going.<span> </span>Maybe next time we'll hear DOOM over some Zaytoven beats.</span></p></div>"|13797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13797-atl-rmx/|5.6|Ian Cohen

Likes: obscure mid-80s British indie, home recording, BBC docu-dramas, cryptic album art. Dislikes: having picture taken, using birth name. Not opposed to LDRs."" Mayfair Set principals Mike Sniper (aka Brooklyn bedroom rocker Blank Dogs) and Dee Dee (aka one-woman L.A. garage band the Dum Dum Girls) didn't come together through some makeoutclub.com-style online hub for lonely, lo-fi enthusiasts, but given the limited information available about this secretive, camera-shy outfit, it's as good an origin myth as any. Because the Mayfair Set's debut EP, <i>Young One</i>, feels very much like a relationship forged in separate bedrooms thousands of miles apart, with Sniper and Dee Dee's shared points of interest and strikingly similar M.O.s ultimately underscoring the distance-- both spatial and aesthetic-- between the two artists. <br/><br/> If the eight songs here weren't actually conceived via FedExed cross-country cassette swaps, then great care has been taken to make it seem so; often <i>Young One</i> feels less like two people collaborating together in the same room than each taking turns dubbing their parts over one another's decaying demos, with faint traces of taped-over recordings bubbling up into the murky mix. If Blank Dogs' distorto-pop tends to soak Sniper's vocals in static, on ""Already Warm"" he's practically buried beneath the Earth's crust, adopting a deep, almost comical gothic warble that makes Dee Dee's corrosive coos shine like high beams on an 18-wheeler. Extreme contrast proves to be <i>Young One</i>'s defining quality, be it the beauty-and-the-beast dynamic between the two leads on the fuzzed-out funk of ""Let It Melt"", or the way the chilly post-punk pulse of ""Desert Fun"" suddenly yields to a bright, beach-bound chorus that sells you on the promise of ""fun, fun in the desert sun,"" as if having fun amid the opressive heat of a desert sun was a plausibility for these agoraphobes. <br/><br/> Sonically, the Mayfair Set hew much closer to the Blank Dogs' mechanized squall than the Dum Dum Girls' garage rock, but Sniper is under no illusion as to who's got the better set of pipes, maintaining a shadowy presence while Dee Dee takes control of the liquefied C86 pop of ""Junked!"" and the curious, girl-group-gone-dub showcase ""Three for Me"". But it's on ""Dark House""-- tellingly, the one track where Sniper's voice complements rather than competes with Dee Dee's-- that the Mayfair Set feels like something greater than just a casual, lo-fi lark between friends. Here they deliver a potent dose of dream-pop melancholy that conjures the surrender-to-the-sea imagery of the Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", but grows more intense and despairing with each line-by-line trade-off. It's the moment where the Mayfair Set overcome the binary, back-and-forth quality of a long-distance relationship, and start to feel more like a natural, face-to-face interaction.</p></div>"|13799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13799-young-one/|6.8|Stuart Berman

Her compositions are usually longer than 45 minutes and the effect of her music-- or, the effect it's had on me-- is cumulative and requires patience. If I want slogans or instant, searing gratification, I am more than happy to turn on ""Born to Run"", and sometimes do. If I want a warm, private rumble, I turn on Eliane Radigue and turn off my phone.</p>
<p>Not only is her music impossible to sample, it's hard to grade-- something that Important Records' John Brien underscored in an email to me recently by saying, ""Good luck w/ that."" Important-- a label Brien started in 2001 out of his apartment in Newburyport, Mass., a coastal city 45 minutes north of Boston-- has played midwife to small-batch underground stuff ranging from Om live records to a 13xCD Merzbow set packaged in a handmade bamboo box. (The label's motto: ""Because we love music even more than you."") By comparison then, their issuing of <i>Triptych</i> (1978) and <i>Vice Versa, etc.</i> (1970), which have never been on CD, is one of their least esoteric, plainly noble gestures-- they're just getting the music out there where it didn't exist before.</p>
<p>Both pieces came at pivot points in Radigue's career. <i>Vice Versa</i> is a tape-based drone recorded in 1970, a year before Radigue started working with the ARP 2500, a synthesizer that looks like a telephone switchboard with a keyboard and weighs about 60 pounds. For decades after, she used it exclusively. 1978's  <i>Triptych</i> was Radigue's first full composition after dropping out of music to dedicate herself to Tibetan Buddhism in 1974. (Though she didn't leave Buddhism behind-- her works through the 70s, 80s, and 90s are not only suffused with a sense of contemplativeness and unrepentant nowness, but they're literally based on events and stories from Buddhist literature.)</p>
<p><i>Vice Versa</i> is made from tape feedback, divided into four tracks played at different speeds, the shortest lasting 2:44 and the longest lasting 13:43. The set's second disc is the same tracks, backwards. Radigue's intention was to let a listener mix and match (which is unusual given that digital technology makes this infinitely easier than it would've been 40 years ago, though this also explains why <i>VV</i>'s first and only run was limited to <i>10 copies</i>).</p>
<p>Unlike <i>Triptych</i>-- or most of what she wrote during the ARP years-- there's not a lot of rise and fall to the composition. It's sensuous music; it's actually about sound. Did I play the backwards tracks against the frontwards ones? Yes, and to great satisfaction. My speakers quivered, my mind released. But while the concept behind the music is elegant, it's also the music's driving force, and it ultimately makes the piece feel antiseptic compared to what came later. [For some good, honest writing on the dilemma of music designed to be listened to in specific, sometimes inconvenient ways, read Pitchfork managing editor Mark Richardson's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/7725-resonant-frequency-64/"" target=""_blank"">recent Resonant Frequency column</a>.]</p>
<p><i>Triptych</i>, conversely, is wonderful. Radigue's music doesn't just have depth, it has narrative: it rises and falls; it dilates and contracts, utilizing pure <i>sound</i> rather than harmony for its development. Watching Radigue work in the studio (there's documentary footage of this), it's easier to understand how her music sounds as hand-hewn as it does: She's actually sitting there, sliding sliders, patching cables, turning dials. It's guided by human hands and feels that way-- enveloping, almost sweet. Her stopwatch, which she uses to measure the duration of tones in a piece, is nicknamed ""nounours""-- ""teddy bear.""</p>
<p><i>Triptych</i> works over long periods of time in weirdly magical ways-- 40 seconds of the piece might sound exactly the same, but skip ahead five minutes and it will sound completely different. It's subtle, but it keeps a dynamic. This is the best defense it has against listeners who might just want to say that it bores them because ""nothing happens""-- it's right there; things are happening constantly, they're just almost imperceptible.</p>
<p>Whether or not you want this experience in your life-- of deep listening to quiet music that does more to facilitate thought and imagination than guide it-- is up to you. Like rock climbing or marriage or anything else, all avocational arguments for it are slightly moral. I don't privilege Radigue's music over other music, but I do privilege it over other music of its kind. In a recent documentary by Austria's Institute for Media Archeology, Radigue said, ""In the beginning, there was a certain music that I wished to make. It was this particular music and no other."" It's not an overstatement: Hers is a particular music, but there's nothing like it.</p></div>"|13661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13661-triptych-vice-versa-etc/|8.0|Mike Powell

Like rock climbing or marriage or anything else, all avocational arguments for it are slightly moral. I don't privilege Radigue's music over other music, but I do privilege it over other music of its kind. In a recent documentary by Austria's Institute for Media Archeology, Radigue said, ""In the beginning, there was a certain music that I wished to make. It was this particular music and no other."" It's not an overstatement: Hers is a particular music, but there's nothing like it.</p></div>"|13661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13661-triptych-vice-versa-etc/|6.4|Mike Powell

Harms uses only effects pedals and a mixer to make rhythms so repetitive they suggest artistic OCD. But within those parameters, he also creates impressively diverse textures. As his mono-beats roll forward, he piles on layers of gritty, tactile sound, the sonic equivalent of a character in the video game <i>Katamari Damacy</i> gathering sticky debris with his growing ball.</p>
<p>In the process, Harms evokes big-beat dance, abstract IDM, harsh noise, psych-rock, even death metal, all while sticking to his simple A/B rhythms. Which is probably why Dan Deacon, another artist with a knack for mixing abstraction and structure, told <i>Pitchfork</i> in 2007 that Harms ""is my favorite performer right now. He is the master of his domain. More human than human.""</p>
<p><i>Strange Gods</i> definitely sounds both fleshy and mechanistic, both monotonous and body-moving. It's as if Harms grafted the squall of Prurient or John Wiese onto the pound of Aphex Twin or Mouse on Mars (that is, if they made their beats without synths or drum machines). You could also shorthand Mincemeat or Tenspeeed as a more extreme version of Black Dice or Fuck Buttons, but Harms' purism sets him apart. The first beat he picks is the one he's sticking with, and he doesn't seem to care much if you stick with it, too. Sometimes it even sounds like he wants to outlast you.</p>
<p>That's definitely the case on <i>Strange Gods</i>' longest tracks, such as the relentlessly bouncy ""Hulot"", the cuttingly metallic ""Points and Lines"", and the buzzsaw warp of ""Throw Hands"". Throughout these marathons, the rhythms can get swallowed by the bulging sounds-- distortion, feedback, a high-pitched din akin to a brutal metal guitar solo. But inevitably the beat returns, stronger and more repetitive than ever. Such stubbornness may seem tedious, but there's something indelibly hypnotic about the way Harms slowly changes the sonic envelope around his oscillations. It's like watching time-lapse footage of a city skyline, as the changing light and motion color the buildings but never erase their immovable presence.</p>
<p>Whether or not that sounds like fun, it's hard to imagine being turned off by <i>Strange Gods</i>, since Harms always cuts his noise with a beat that's easy to hang onto. When he lets that beat take over, like during the catchy first half of ""Padre Iscand (Colonization)"", you can easily picture him performing inside the kind of ecstatic crowd circles that Deacon often attracts. But don't count on it-- my guess is that Harms is less interested in attracting fans than finding a personal nirvana inside his endless repetitions.</p></div>"|13777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13777-strange-gods/|7.0|Marc Masters

That's about as good a year a rapper can have while releasing almost no new music whatsoever. To cap it off? Actual music-- albeit just 22 minutes of it, on this mixtape that popped up in the middle of December.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Maybe that needed to happen: If Lupe embodies any aspect of post-Kanye hip-hop, it's using greater access to candor and transparency to prove himself more unlikeable with every statement he makes outside of the booth.<span> </span>A lot of times, it's been tough to remember that we were intrigued not because he rapped from the perspective of a cheeseburger, but rather because he simply rapped his ass off.<span> </span>But outside of a few blips-- most notably, a RZA-styled, self-satisfied anthropomorphology of the United States tagged on to end of ""The National Anthem""--<span> </span><i>Enemy of the State </i><span>tends to steer towards the latter version of Lupe with often fantastic results.<span> </span>It's particularly true of ""The National Anthem"": Though rappers have been sampling Radiohead since the glory days of Chino XL, for the most part, it's an olive branch to alternative nation, the easiest way to show how refined your taste in non-rap music is.<span> </span>Suffice to say the biggest compliment you can give is that ""Anthem"" bangs even if you've never heard one second of </span><i>Kid A. </i>I<span>t's crucial that Lupe raps </span><i>with </i><span>the beat as opposed to merely over it, sounding equally adept atop the bassline as he is during the horn-led climax-- it's a great touch as his boast ""I don't think I'm best, I just think I'm better than..."" is completed by Thom Yorke singing ""...everyone.""<span> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A question that's been raised by <i>Enemy of the State </i><span>is whether it's Lupe ""going at"" Jay-Z.<span> </span>While it's been Lupe's M.O. to mostly beef with rap bloggers, there is a notable lean on Jay's material (""Thank You"", ""So Ghetto"") that goes beyond ""</span><i>Blueprint 3 </i><span>could've been something if someone else rapped over those beats.""<span> </span>""So Ghetto"" showcases Lupe's ""</span><i>Food &amp; Liquor </i><span>flow"" as a kite to an incarcerated friend, and perhaps self-consciously, ""Where I'm From"", one of Jay's gulliest tracks, gets flipped into ""Angels"", a rangy, Auto-Tuned love song.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But elsewhere, <i>Enemy </i><span>keeps things short, vital, and mostly current: ""Back By Popular Demand"" is a fair exchange for Clipse's inclusion ""Dumb It Down"" on their </span><i>Road to Til the Casket Drops </i><span>mixtape, and ""The One"" is proof that DJ Khalil's beat could've been something had it not been saddled with that hook and the relentlessly personality-free raps of Slaughterhouse.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sure, there are still plenty of times when Lupe's charmingly overreaching with his punchlines, but I wouldn't trade it considering how revitalized Lupe sounds. Though it's pretty much impossible to not be amped by the ""Final Countdown""-styled bounce of Travis Porter's ""All the Way Turnt Up"" and the yo-yo synth of Lil' Wayne's ""Fireman"", the performances are potent reminders of Lupe's sheer technical prowess-- ""All the Way"" agreeably slouches through half-time punchlines (""I came to take it all back like I'm Miller High Life"") and while the former cuts off at about two and a half minutes, he raps like he could go on for five times that.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So, is that grade up there justifying a lack of, I dunno, <i>ambition</i><span>?<span> </span>Tough to say: Though a conceptual framework gave us ""Gotta Eat"", it also resulted in ""Kick, Push"".<span> </span>Then again, mere days after </span><i>Enemy of the State </i><span>dropped, you could find Lupe dedicating about as many words as there are on this tape to putting RapRadar.com on blast for god knows what.<span> </span>Whatever becomes of that, at least we'll have this</span><span> reminder of what Lupe is capable of when he's given a mic instead of a soapbox.<span> </span></span></p>

Tracks are cheap and easy to compile, and sometimes you end up with a really fabulous mix or two. But even the turkeys are guaranteed to make blog rounds on the synergistic strength of your and your celebrity remixers' names-- thus extending the limited buzz-life of original material. So does <i>Who Designs Nature's How</i> mean Bell Orchestre is a real band and not just an Arcade Fire side project? Hold the emails; it's a rhetorical question. Still, you have to wonder what Richard Reed Parry, Sarah Neufeld, and the part-timing Luyas intended with this perfectly pleasant but hardly revelatory remix EP of their 2009 avant-orch-pop album, <i>As Seen Through Windows</i>.</p>
<p>Bell Orchestre enlisted a credible lineup of mostly established electronic artists and studio wizards, including Tim Hecker, Mad Professor, Kid Koala, and Hôtel-de-Ville's Rhett Brewer, to rework the analog-recorded (by Tortoise's John McEntire) source material. Not surprisingly, none of the remixers embarrass themselves. Kid Koala, for example, strips some of the richer string and woodwind arrangements from ""Icicles/Bicycles"" and foregrounds a single plucked string tone, to hypnotic effect. In the process, he makes a minor point: Bell Orchestre, who rarely fail to indulge their whims-- from lumbering horn passages to the forced whizz-bang of group cheers-- might actually benefit from a little more focus. ""Water/Light/Shifts"" takes similar shape in Tim Hecker's hands. The original twinkles like twilight-drunk fireflies and damp fairy lights, which the remix distills into a thick spray of white noise. Both versions, however, offer the same soothing, mind-clearing mood of a yoga routine topped by a cup of green tea.</p>
<p>""As Seen Through Windows"" is probably the only remix that bothers to shift any frames. Dub legend Mad Professor reverb-warps the album track's melancholy melody (intentionally or not, a doppelgänger for Julee Cruise's ""Mysteries of Love""), layering it atop a hiccupping dubstep beat. What once implied a high school gym packed with band geeks who've locked their faculty advisor in the supply closet is now a 3 a.m. Special K-fuelled London nightclub hallucination. That Mad Professor's the rare guest who understands his remix assignment and stamps a legible signature on it is puzzling, but what's really weird is that Bell Orchestre's presumably content to release an EP of bland, faithful fare. I don't say this because they're experimentally inclined and genre-uncommitted, either. When a band plots an album around a concept like <i>As Seen Through Windows</i>, they're clearly curious about the subjective nature of art and eager to peer through as many lenses as possible.</p></div>"|13795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13795-who-designs-natures-how/|5.5|Amy Granzin

Black to Comm's <i>Alphabet 1968 </i>clocks in at a modest 43 minutes but probes the depths of ambient, drone, and modern classical composition with both restraint and imagination.</p>
<p>Like a lot of experimental composers, Black to Comm's Marc Richter has operated on the fringes for a half-decade, placing several releases on an assemblage of labels, including his own Hamburg-based Dekorder. <i>Alphabet 1968</i>, on the increasingly impressive Type label, functions as his first widely available release, and it establishes Richter as a deft composer and an inspired stylist.</p>
<p>The year 1968 permeates more than just the album's title, as the album's 10 tracks mimic the burbling, psychedelic compositions of German experimental music from that era. (Visually as well: the artwork bears a passing resemblance to <i>Cluster &amp; Eno</i>, and the cheap-fade, dual-color tracklist reeks of import bin design hell.) More importantly, <i>Alphabet 1968</i> privileges composition above method, repeatedly blurring the line between electronic and acoustic elements.</p>
<p><i>Alphabet 1968</i> opens in intimidating fashion, rolling through nearly a third of the album's run time in the first two tracks, the rain-drenched piano ballad, ""Jonathan"", and the thumping, beatific ""Forst"", which sounds like the Field stretched putty-thin. From there, however, Richter lets <i>Alphabet</i> breathe, favoring short pieces that bleed into and out of each other. ""Rauschen""'s slowly thumbed acoustic guitar plays against an abstracted field recording. It lasts for just two minutes before segueing to the hectic music-box tinker of ""Musik Für Alle"". ""Traum GmbH"" features dollops of saturated organ noise.</p>
<p>Richter anchors <i>Alphabet</i> with the ghastly, haunted pointillist whir of ""Houdini Rites"" and the monstrous bass tones of ""Void"" before redeeming the mood with ""Hotel Freund"", a harp-tinged orchestral movement that features an overlay of children's voices at play. ""Hotel Freund"" is a fittingly warm finale for an ambient/drone album that never lets its sound world become too insular. Richter's compositions function on a similar level as compositions by Tim Hecker and Fennesz, but they're far less abstract-- <i>this</i> is a guitar, and <i>this</i> is a harp, and <i>that</i> is rain. This is by no means a revolutionary accomplishment-- electro-acoustic composers have long toed the line between the abstract and the recognizable-- but, combined with <i>Alphabet</i>'s manageable sequencing and length, it's refreshing on the heels of lengthy, career-defining efforts by similar artists. <i>Alphabet 1968</i> is an adventurous, intriguing listen, but it succeeds because it takes sound worlds many consider epic and scales them down to palatable, weekday size.</p></div>"|13789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13789-alphabet-1968/|7.8|Andrew Gaerig

Both his grooves and his synthesizers suggest an almost idealized vision of mid-1990s Detroit techno. But using the c-word still feels like a failure of the imagination. (Depending where you stand on the whole ""retro"" issue, it also might feel like an insult.) For one thing, it's hard to think of many actual Detroit techno albums that actually sound quite like <i>The Dance Paradox</i>, Redshape's debut album.</p>
<p>Carl Craig's <i>Landcruising</i> and <i>More Songs About Food and Revolutionary Art</i> both come to mind, in tone and instrumentation, but they're actually very different: more diverse and probably more ambitious, but also not as focused on a single, binding mood as <i>The Dance Paradox</i>. Urban Tribe's <i>The Collapse of Modern Culture</i> (one of the 90s' finest electronic-music albums, and criminally out of print today) might offer a better precedent for Redshape's anxious, brooding, sentimentally dystopian sounds, but again-- musically speaking, structurally speaking-- Redshape's record has its own agenda.</p>
<p>A bit like Burial, who reworked the signifiers of UK Garage into an extremely personal sound, Redshape takes the essential tropes of techno's most fertile period-- grooves fused from chugging drum machines and quicksilver drum breaks, endless arrays of synthesizers that gleam like the skyline of a dead city-- to create a unique and compelling style, one defined above all by its sensuality.</p>
<p>True to its title, <i>The Dance Paradox</i> refuses to take the concept of ""dance music"" at face value. Its salient elements-- lithe 909 patterns, roiling bass arpeggios, spine-tingling synth flourishes-- come from the club, but none of its tracks run above 123 BPM, and some sink to 118 or even 108. (For a measure of comparison, contemporary house music typically clocks between 120 and 125 BPM, while classic techno often reached well into the 130s.) But what the music sacrifices in tempo it makes up for in force. Slow and lumbering, it executes its maneuvers like a ship approaching port, unfurling long, interwoven melodic leads whose full arc only becomes clear by track's end.</p>
<p>Despite their pace and their ruminative mood, these aren't chillout tracks; they're meant to be heard loud, the mass of the sound sweeping you up like a rising tide. Both cautious and immediate, deliberate and explosive, the music wonderfully captures the fraught drama of antecedents like Carl Craig or Urban Tribe. Just listen to the slowly churning ""Rorschach's Game"", which assembles itself as if from ashes, rising from white noise atop a thundering kick drum beneath an opalescent shimmer that wouldn't sound out of place on an Emeralds jam; shakers and skipping hi-hats flesh out its form, clattering like magnets clapped onto a metal exoskeleton. And then, to climax, Redshape unleashes an enormous series of drum fills, almost certainly played by a human drummer on a real drum kit, and the whole thing comes tumbling down, as though the rug beneath had been pulled free.</p>
<p>""Man Out of Time"" follows a similar trajectory, laying out layers of plangent string patches over a heart-in-mouth breakbeat. (A sort of industrial take on downtempo, it sounds like an armored-up version of Mo' Wax's 1996 <i>Excursions</i> compilation.) The lush ""Bound (Part 1 &amp; 2)"", the album's most overtly techno track, rides dissonant mid-range arpeggios and a hard, overtone-rich bass throb, stoking a sense of unremitting tension; its melodic, ambient outro suggests how Redshape is looking beyond the dancefloor and the 12"", helping give <i>The Dance Paradox</i> a sense of flow that's uncommon for techno longplayers created in the 2000s.</p>
<p>Redshape's synthesizers deserve special mention. The artist, who remains nominally anonymous (five minutes of internet sleuthing will lead you to an unmasking about as anticlimactic as Burial's), has claimed to favor analog gear, and it sounds like it-- although the way that software synths are evolving, it's getting harder and harder to tell. In any case, the specific tools matter less than what the artist achieves with them. Here, it's an array of sounds by turns metallic, velvety, porous, and pulverous. Emphasizing timbre and texture over melody and harmony, they're in constant motion-- sweeping, swelling, crumbling. They suggest Philly International's string ostinatos, frozen and then bronzed and crusted with oxidation; they billow out like dust-clouds around the base of a demolished high-rise. At the risk of tripping over techno's postmodern pathetic fallacy, Redshape's music, like that of his Detroit inspirations, almost invariably evokes visions of a kind of tarnished futurism. It throws up gleaming, industrial age surfaces and then revels in their decay.</p></div>"|13802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13802-the-dance-paradox/|7.3|Philip Sherburne

The instrumental, electro-acoustic Austrian trio Radian has spent more than a decade as a seemingly contradictory hybrid itself. Perched between precise composition and improvisational creation, members Martin Brandlmayr, Stefan Németh, and John Norman wear their glitch-heavy, avant-garde pedigrees on their collective sleeve, making sure their songs are sculpted and pockmarked just so. But on <i>Chimeric</i>, they stretch out and breathe a bit more, elongating melodies and placing more accent on organic sounds, such as wisps of brushed snare drums and the vibraphones' soft echo.</p>
<p>The band's last album, 2004's <i>Juxtaposition</i>,<i> </i>blended labored-over microtones and billowy bass; on ""Rapid Eye Movement"", Brandlmayr's taps, scrapes and brushes don't accompany as much as sync up with oscillating, mechanical screeches and tones. <i>Chimeric </i>is relatively looser and less dense, owing to more reliance on live interaction. While it's arguable how loose the micro-managing trio allowed themselves to become during mixing, since recordings were re-organized and spliced together as if working with a tape machine, <i>Chimeric</i> sounds like the product of less tense and more spacious recording sessions. The band considers the record raw, broken, and unpolished, but they have nothing to be apologetic about. By loosening up they sound invigorated.</p>
<p>The hum of a switch being slowly flicked on and off at the outset of opener ""Git Cut Noise"" could be a gesture toward the analog and imperfect. It continues stomping forward in fitful starts, eventually picking up a caustic tone and a bass line with a slow, creeping gait. The 10-minute ""Feedback Mikro / City Lights"" indulges in a slow-burning crescendo, with interplay between a bright, churning guitar line, wavering tones, and a circular, ramshackle drum pattern. Songs like ""Chimera"" find the band occupying a more open landscape. It's a dusty plateau dotted with lonely snatches of guitar notes and sweeping cymbals, one of the many finely tuned sounds Brandlmayr coaxes out of his drum kit. In his hands, the drums seem as rich a source of textures and tones as a sampler, ranging from slow, sweeping pulses to chaotic, jagged fills.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>Rec.Extern</i> and <i>Juxtaposition,</i> <i>Chimeric </i>was not recorded with producer and Tortoise drummer John McEntire. But between Brandlmayr's swirling, textured percussion and the band's more breezy approach-- compare the jazzy brushes and washes of sound on the <i>Chimeric</i> track ""Subcolors"" with the more taut variations on ""Rapid Eye Movement"" and ""Shift"" off <i>Juxtaposition-- </i>the new album sounds more informed by the trappings of Chicago post-rock and improv. That's one of the main reasons <i>Chimeric</i> is much more a rearranging of existing elements and past themes than a reinvention. Despite the slight advantageous shifts, it isn't the new creature its name might imply.</p></div>"|13782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13782-chimeric/|7.0|Patrick Sisson

That manifesto shows up a few times on the Tough Alliance-run Sincerely Yours label's website. As is the Gothenburg, Sweden-based electronic pop duo's habit, the words are borrowed, in this case from Belgian author and Situationist International member Raoul Vaneigem. You could think of TTA's music as sort of a living shrine to pleasure: unabashedly catchy, defiantly emotional, with gaudy synthetic beats and fuck-you bravado. But nobody can stave off boredom forever.</p>
<p>In fact, TTA have been conspicuously quiet lately. Since releasing <i>A New Chance</i>, their second full-fledged album, in 2007, co-conspirators Eric Berglund and Henning Fürst have put out precious little new material under the TTA name: a pair of covers, a remix of Victoria Bergsman's Taken by Trees, and various remixes by other people of their own songs. The six TTA remixes collected on the mp3-only <i>Prison Break</i> EP are uniformly solid and occasionally revelatory dancefloor fare, well worth any Swede-head's $5.35. But <i>Prison Break</i> is an exceptionally weird release. As good as it is, this EP should have the duo's fans growing only more and more impatient for the next album or single-- unknown pleasures, still.</p>
<p>In early November, Sincerely Yours mailing list subscribers received a typically enigmatic message, with one link to a new track by jj, and another to information about this EP. ""Better late than never,"" the linked page says; digital music seller Klicktrack lists <i>Prison Break</i>'s release date as Oct. 31, 2008. The fuck? What's more, these remixes don't change the title of the original track, a naming convention that's usually standard for the Sincerely Yours crew (""Now That's What I Call Indulgence"", not ""Indulgence (The Tough Alliance Remix)""; ""The Sweetness of Air France"", not ""Sweetness (Air France Remix)""). One possible clue: Two of these remixes, a ravey ""Neo Violence"" by Dutch DJ/producer Laidback Luke (grab his remix of Robin S.'s ""Show Me Love"" with Sweden's Steve Angello) and a dubby space-disco ""Neo Violence"" by L.A.-based DFA/Rong signee Woolfy, came out in 2008 on Modular-- <i>not</i> Sincerely Yours. Regardless, rounding out a trio of ""Neo Violence"" takes here is a fine Daft Punk-style electro-house reworking by Perth-based Shazam.</p>
<p>Whatever <i>Prison Break</i>'s origins, the people you expect to be the heavy-hitters pretty much are. Barcelona's El Guincho is a TTA kindred spirit, sharing their yen for sunny globe-trotting, but his chiming, euphoric ""First Class Riot"" gets overshadowed a bit by jj's absolutely radiant ""touch of jules &amp; jim"" version. Taking a name from 1962 French film <i>Jules &amp; Jim</i>, jj's remix puts a hushed female voice alongside TTA's, which jj chop up and toy with like marionettes (or like that Grateful Dead sample on ""What Would I Want? Sky""), making TTA shout out ""touch of you"" and then a sublimely dumb ""da da"" melody atop girlish giggles and John Williams-grandiose orchestration. The Juan MacLean's ""A New Chance"", meanwhile, remains near perfection, ensconcing the original in the finest techno-house marble for future generations to marvel upon.</p>
<p>""It's not a question of understanding it, man. If you feel it, you feel it, stupid."" That quote, from a John Cassavetes film, shows up more than once on this EP, and it's still the best encapsulation of the Sincerely Yours spirit. We could quibble about the absence of Brooklyn duo Tanlines' highlife-meets-Whigfield ""A New Chance"" remix, or California krautrock-disco duo Windsurf's ""Neo Violence (Windsurf's Neon Violet Dub)"", or other DJ-ready TTA remixes by Alvy Singer and Stevie Tech Nicks.

He re-entered the political arena on the wrong foot, pissing off his fan base by endorsing Richard Nixon for president in 1972; he tried to get in on Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield's blaxploitation-soundtracking action, putting together music for <i>Black Caesar</i> and <i>Slaughter's Big Rip-Off.</i> He attempted to position himself as a crossover-minded mainstream entertainer, as a hardcore funk iconoclast, as an anti-drug humanitarian, and as a swinging party dude, all at the same time. Amazingly, he got away with most of it, and oversaw an expanding business at the same time-- People Records, a showcase for members of his revue, had recently launched. (Brown's name was plastered all over every People label's singles.)</p>
<p>It helped that, as usual, even some of his moves that looked terrible on their face worked out just fine. Anyone else would have thought twice about releasing a dramatic reading, with strings, of a poem about heroin written by a waiter at the Godfather's favorite deli. (""King Heroin"" became a massive hit.) It also wasn't an obvious gesture to cover the ""5"" Royales' ""Think"" with a slick New York studio crew rather than his touring band in 1973-- especially since he'd already covered it as a single three times in the 60s-- or to pair it with a scenery-chewing soul version of the Beatles' ""Something"". (Shortly thereafter, he re-recorded his vocal for ""Think"", this time beginning with a little spiel about ""Soul Train"", and released it again as his <i>next</i> single; it hit the charts both times.)</p>
<p>And it definitely seemed like a bad idea to bring saxophonist and former bandleader Maceo Parker back into his band without telling the rest of the group before they showed up at the recording studio, to release the result under his trombonist's name rather than his own, and to give its two parts separate titles that appear nowhere in its lyrics rather than naming it after the hook. ""Doing It to Death"", credited to Fred Wesley &amp; the J.B.'s and released on People, became a #1 R&amp;B single anyway.</p>
<p>The one musical desire Brown still couldn't gratify was his longing for another ballad on the order of ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"", which had been in his set for eight years (and would stay there for the rest of his life). ""Mama's Dead"" and the ghastly two-part ""Woman"" are both lugubrious rewrites of the real thing; ""Nothing Beats a Try But a Fail"" never even made it to the racks. The hard funk masterpieces, on the other hand, still flowed freely. ""There It Is"" is one of the hottest tracks he ever cut, a jubilant piece of cross-chatter whose fraction-of-a-second silences are like splashes of cold water. ""Get on the Good Foot"", ""I Got a Bag of My Own"", a jubilant strut through Bill Doggett's ""Honky Tonk"", the perfectly titled ""I Got Ants in My Pants (And I Want to Dance)"": the man was on a roll.</p>
<p>Well, the man and his band, rather. Trombonist/bandleader Fred Wesley had been Brown's secret weapon for a while; by 1973, he was practically the co-star, the guy in charge of translating the boss's grunts and whims into hits. The soundtrack numbers on this set's second disc obviously bear his imprint, and even beyond ""Doing It to Death"", Wesley and the J.B.'s get off a bunch of great, slinky funk singles under their own name. Soul Brother #1 chants along for most of them, and even sits in on drums for a not-bad-at-all instrumental cover of Herbie Hancock's ""Watermelon Man"". Brown was starting to recapitulate his past hits more and more (""Sexy, Sexy, Sexy"", a substantial 1973 hit, is a note-for-note reprise of 1966's ""Money Won't Change You""), but for at least a few more years, his group's momentum was still pulling him into the future.</p></div>"|13774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13774-the-singles-vol-8-1972-1973/|8.4|Douglas Wolk

It's integral to his career, but it's only one part of his repertoire-- a modern take on the glib ridiculousness and lighthearted arrogance that once were Steve Martin's specialties. And, like Martin, Mirman's recurring TV comedy roles (""Flight of the Conchords""; ""Delocated"") and writings (last year's exercise in self-help delirium <i>The Will to Whatevs</i>) display a range of humor at which stand-up can only hint. So when someone is so consistently and accessibly funny in all these different venues-- on the stage, on cable, in print, on his blog, on YouTube-- what's another 40ish minutes?</p>
<p>Yet Mirman's second CD for Sub Pop, <i>God Is a Twelve-Year-Old Boy With Asperger's</i>, is just as characteristically amusing as anything else he's done in the past few years. It crams a lot of absurdity into its first half-hour: a discussion on bears living in the ruins of Detroit culminates in a debate between Mirman and an ursine member of the audience (""But there <i>are</i> bears! There's some in East Lansing--"" ""RERARARHGHG""), his tendency to concoct nonsensical slogans results in ideas for deranged internet banner ads (""Should the Iraq war be a war, or something else, like donuts or television?""), and there's a telling story about how a school-age Mirman delivered a book report by dressing as a cowboy and lip-synching a Bill Cosby record, subsequently dooming him to six years of special ed (""you get an A+, but you have to see a doctor"").</p>
<p>Thankfully, Mirman's comedy never approaches the tedium of bad hey-remember-this pop-culture jokes or slapped-together ""OMG random"" ADD frivolity. It's more like a bewildered voyage through a mind that jumps from bafflement to surgical deconstruction in an instant. He throws around <i>non sequiturs</i> and oddball juxtapositions, but does so for real effect, using them them to punctuate the already existing weirdness of a situation, like he does when he deconstructs a Russian TV station's ethnically insensitive internet polls (Q: ""Roma around the world get a hard time because..."" The leading answer: ""They have a longstanding criminal reputation"") to riff off just how awkward racial discourse still is. And not just in Russia: Q: ""How should we deal with racism in America?"" A: ""Have Bruce Springsteen write a letter to poor people explaining that black people are just like them, but black.""</p>
<p>The drawback to this album is its drawn-out ending, which puts Mirman in vendetta-against-faceless-companies mode for the second time on the album. There's a lot of frustration-borne laughs in the first instance, where Mirman gets mad at the gas company for screwing up his account and responds with threats as creative as they are petulant (""I will be mailing you a photograph of cows having sex every day because it isn't illegal""). But when he revisits that turf in a tirade against the customer service ineptitude of an airline that lost his luggage-- roping in another couple of comedians to play the CSRs, one of whom does an admittedly funny Christopher Walken-- it loses a lot of the unpredictable yet to-the-point sharpness of the material earlier in his set, and it pales next to the similar ""Fleet Bank"" bit from <i>The Absurd Nightclub Comedy of Eugene Mirman</i>. The closest the ""_____ Airlines"" bits come to his usual brilliant absurdity is the fact that the airline in question has its name bleeped out, yet the bleep is so short it's hard not to guess which one it is anyways.</p>
<p>Granted, this isn't the first Eugene Mirman-based work of comedy you should buy. <i>Absurd Nightclub Comedy </i>is the best album to start with, and if you have to choose between <i>God Is a Twelve-Year-Old Boy With Asperger's</i> and <i>The Will to Whatevs </i>among his more recent offerings, go for the latter<span>. But get this when you can, and give it a listen: Mirman is one of those comedians who just gets funnier with each new work he releases, and those 40ish minutes do a great job in moving that process along.</span></p></div>"|13784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13784-god-is-a-twelve-year-old-boy-with-aspergers/|7.4|Nate Patrin

The busy producer/DJ/songwriter has spent the last decade remixing artists like Cut Copy and Annie while working for France's Tigersushi Records. A classically trained composer, Joakim periodically submits full-lengths of his own material, genre-jumping affairs that play like the product of an artist with disparate, long-developed ideas and non-traditional thoughts about what a full-length should accomplish. <i>Milky Ways</i>, Joakim's latest offering, vacillates between lengthy psych-rock dirges, Italo-disco frippery, and foggy art-pop, a de facto running commentary on contemporary trends.</p>
<p>Despite his shapeshifting, Joakim's reputation lies firmly in the electronic realm, and even the open-minded will have trouble preparing themselves for ""Back to Wilderness"", an eight-minute squall of distorted guitars trampled by huge, live drums. This may be the product of Joakim's working band, the Disco (want running commentary, zeitgeist? The Disco were formerly known as the Ectoplasmic Band), a relationship that sees a handful of <i>Milky Ways</i>' songs recorded virtually live. Expectation obliterator, palate cleanser, band workout, whatever: ""Wilderness"" probably should've populated a B-side somewhere, because the remainder of <i>Milky Ways</i> musters plenty of variance without resorting to such transparent adventuring.</p>
<p>Joakim's best work on <i>Milky Ways</i> comes via contemplative dance fodder. ""Spiders"" stretches out on short, timorous arpeggios and occasional guitar chirps, clearing room for a slow-chanted group chorus. ""Ad Me"" reestablishes order after ""Wilderness"" with blasts of dated, fake symphonics, and robotic, vocoder'd chatter. On ""Love &amp; Romance &amp; A Special Person"", a resonant major-key vocal melody burrows into Bouaziz's computer-love funk. The Kraut-y ""Travel in Vain"", its nodding momentum paced and familiar, touches on James Murphy's adroit simplicity.</p>
<p>Joakim could probably roll off an entire album of these electro-punk gems, but he's too skittish. Sometimes-- the aforementioned ""Wilderness"", the post-rock jamminess of ""King Kong is Dead""-- he trips over his own shoelaces; often he molds weird, lingering pop music. ""Glossy Papers"" sounds like Giorgio Moroder taking on 1960s psych; ""Medusa"" mimics that chime and crash of Caribou's spicier compositions. ""Fly Like an Apple"" is ominous, lurking rock pastiche. ""Little Girl"", the album's closer and easily its softest moment, is a rhythmic ballad based on a William Blake poem. This is the work of a rarely satisfied auteur with a like-minded band: like Beck if he saw himself both too gaudy and too ragamuffin.</p>
<p>This compositional variety results in an album that lacks a cohesive narrative. If you're keeping score at home, the above basically paints <i>Milky Ways</i> as a drone-metal-electro-soul-funk album, plus or minus some 18th century poetry. To those without the stomach for Joakim's waywardness, <i>Milky Ways</i> will often sound as much during the course of a listen. For those who are feeling adventurous but forgiving of the same, Joakim is a worthy companion.</p></div>"|13748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13748-milky-ways/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

It's just a trick of the eye, though: Throughout its history, this band has sounded more like a trio with the power on the fritz, their instrumental music a series of sputtering Beefheartian paroxysms wedded to fleeting passages of muscular groove. They don't like you to get comfortable listening to their records, preferring to throw you off the scent of a rhythm with a sudden time change or all-out shift into dry, clattering freakout. So it makes sense that they've landed on John Zorn's Tzadik label, which is known for housing a lot of music that would sooner hit you with a shovel than caress or soothe you.</p>
<p>The Asheville, N.C.-based trio hasn't changed its essential sound much, in spite of the departure of original drummer Sean Dail and the addition of his replacement, Ryan Oslance. The biggest shifts are a single, brief sample of a human voice low in the mix at the end of the sarcastically titled ""Dancing With the Stars"", and the very occasional use of distortion on Shane Perlowin's guitar, which until now had been dogmatically clean-toned, leaving the distorted playing to Derek Poteat's bass. Oslance's drumming is a bit looser than Dail's, and the album's overall balance is weighed more toward seething, arrhythmic passages than before.</p>
<p>You get a fair tour of the band's unique world on opener ""2/3 Consensus on the Un-Finite Possibilities"". The first few minutes of the track is like climbing a mountain, as the combination of worming anti-melody and increasingly tense rhythm congeal until the five-minute mark, when the track explodes with cycling guitar and bass riffs as the drum part elasticizes, tightening and loosening at breakneck speed. It collapses into a meditative coda that could be the descent back to base camp. Oslance's best showcase is ""Why Can't We Be in Jamaica?"", where he plays a circular, almost tribal pattern that mutates  over the course of the song as Poteat's distorted bass slings mud at it, and Perlowin's guitar swells in and out with spine-tingling drones. The band's signature onslaught of complex, hyperspeed interplay is on display on ""Owls"" and ""Racing Towards the Hard Kernal"", but in completely different ways-- the former sparkles with bright phrases and is full of breathing room, while the latter is heavy, dense, and violent.</p>
<p>That's a pretty good example of what makes Ahleuchatistas work so well-- they've perfected their extremely basic approach to the point where it seems they can do anything they want with it. I do wonder if the faint whiff of a sample is a foreshadowing of change, but as the band continues to find more ways to make the chaos/order dynamic at its core interesting, it seems evident it doesn't need a lot of outside help to make good, surprising elements that hold your attention, so long as you're the type of listener who enjoys the abstract and somewhat difficult.</p></div>"|13633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13633-of-the-body-prone/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Kelly's career, laziness has rarely been considered. What a decade it's been for Kelly-- he's thrived in a curious way, morphing from true blue 1990s R&amp;B icon into an increasingly strange and beguiling pop culture oddball. He is known by more people now than ever, though not always for the best reasons. He released bold albums (<i>Chocolate Factory</i>), brave albums (<i>Happy People/U Saved Me</i>), and bad albums (<i>TP.3 Reloaded</i>). He has been the maximalist to end all, creating and eventually overindulging his ""Trapped in the Closet"" video novella series. He collaborated on two disappointing albums with Jay-Z. He contributed two of his steeliest songs ever, both ballads, to Whitney Houston's comeback album, <i>I Look to You</i>,<i> </i>this year. He had sex in the kitchen, sex in the jungle, sex with your girlfriend. And on June 13, 2008, Kelly battled and beat child pornography charges. Which, to many, is all that matters now.</p>
<p>But <i>Untitled</i> isn't sunk by the vestiges of scandal-- this just isn't Kelly at his best. He has survived for so many years in a ravenously young genre-- R&amp;B pop-- by innovating. But too often here he trips over trends-- on ""Crazy Night"" he abuses Auto-Tune, on ""Text Me"" he overthinks modern communication, and on ""Superman High"" he mistakes OJ Da Juiceman for a suitable foil. These are the blunders made by an aging man working hard to stay relevant, expending energy on ephemera. In 2008, Kelly planned to release <i>12 Play: 4th Quarter</i>, a third sequel of sorts to his astonishing 1993 debut. But the album (no classic) leaked months in advance, and the project was junked and rerecorded. A handful of songs from <i>4th Quarter</i> have survived and made it to <i>Untitled</i>; but hearing Kelly moan ""This is the 4th quarter!"" on ""Go Low"" is a bizarre remnant-- it disrupts any chance at continuity and is otherwise just confusing to anyone who hasn't followed the story. Scrapping the remaining songs, all unremarkable, would have gone a long way toward trimming what, at 62 minutes, is already a slog.</p>
<p>As with nearly every R. Kelly album, sex is <i>Untitled</i>'s <i>raison d'être</i>. But now it's more discomfiting. Not because his perspective or predilections have changed. They haven't. The man wants to have sex for long periods of time. With multiple partners. At all hours available. But the consequences of his commitment are devastating. Only when he's at his best is it easy to imagine some other R. Kelly, one unmarked by shame, singing with vigor about banging headboards.</p>
<p>""Echo"", a melodic marvel, is the best song Kelly has recorded in years, managing to make yodeling (yes) elemental, not a gimmick. It's graceful and gorgeous and about a sex session. ""Exit"", too, is fascinating reinvention-- Kelly sing-raps every bar, lifting his elastic, burnished voice up at nearly each word's end. To wit: ""Now I can't leave(!) this club(!!!) without(!!) you girl(!!!)/ Swear I (!!) want more(!!) you deserve an encore(!!!)."" This kind of phrasing just isn't normal, and only a person who has written hundreds of songs with same-y lyrics is capable of altering delivery like this. Maybe it's a pittance in the grand scheme of his important career-- modern R&amp;B is racked with artists like The-Dream and Trey Songz who simply would not exist without him-- but these are the things to root for on R. Kelly albums. That there are so few makes this a minor work.</p></div>"|13790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13790-untitled/|4.8|Sean Fennessey

In addition to perhaps filling a hole in an artist's catalog that we didn't even know was there, such occurrences garner enough headlines to make us think we could be sitting on top of similarly undiscovered treasures. That's the story behind <i>My Dusty Road, </i>which begins with the kind of phone call we all wish we got. In 2003, an archivist named Michael Creamer heard from a cousin who said he had been contacted by a woman in Brooklyn claiming to have rare, unreleased recordings of Woody Guthrie. She had, in fact, inherited the masters from the long-defunct Stinson label, which was founded by Herbert Harris and Moe Asch and had been active during the first half of the 20th century. Harris' widow had left the collection to her neighbor, Lucia Sutera, who left it stored in the basement of her apartment building.</p>
<p>As he writes in the liner notes to <i>My Dusty Road</i>, Creamer couldn't let himself believe that such rare Guthrie recordings actually existed, but when he eventually rummaged through the piles of nickel-plated copper discs, he found more than 50 performances from the mid-1940s. In fact, due to the durability of the materials and the means of storage, they were of surprisingly crystalline sound quality, which was all the more unexpected considering Stinson had a reputation among collectors for releasing shoddy records during wartime vinyl rationing. Even the Guthrie recordings that Stinson actually released don't sound this good.</p>
<p>For that alone, <i>My Dusty Road</i>, which collects the bulk of those sessions, is a treasure for historians and Guthrie fans alike. And Rounder has packaged them as such: the set arrives in a small, roadworn suitcase containing reproductions of the folkie's business card, a postcard from Florida to his wife back in New York, and a notice of booking from 1947. There are also novella-length liner notes that not only recount Guthrie's career but document in technical detail the process of discovering, organizing, remastering, and releasing these recordings. And then there's the music itself. Rather than adhere to the order of the original sessions, the tracks have been organized thematically across four discs: ""Woody's Greatest Hits"", ""Woody's Roots"", ""Woody the Agitator"", and ""Woody, Cisco &amp; Sonny"", which features fellow folkie Cisco Houston and blues harmonica player Sonny Terry.</p>
<p>Collecting some of his more popular songs, ""Woody's 'Greatest' Hits"" finds an instructive balance between patriotic flag-waving and outraged dissent. He extols American ingenuity on ""Grand Coulee Dam"" and memorializes dead sailors on the forlorn ""Sinking of the Reuben James"", about a U.S. aid ship torpedoed by a German U-boat. Those songs bristle against outraged numbers like ""This Land Is Your Land"" (which 60 years later seems to have lost most of its socialist connotations) and two versions of ""Goin' Down the Road (I Ain't Gonna Be Treated This Way)"", a powerful cry for empowerment and equality.</p>
<p>That disc proves much feistier than ""Woody the Agitator"", a collection of protest and pro-union songs that sounds curiously subdued. Despite the famous image that adorns the cover (Guthrie and his guitar emblazoned with ""This Machine Kills Fascists""), there's little of the truth-to-power indignation that made him a hero to generations of musicians and listeners. Guthrie conveys some disgust on ""Hangknot, Slipknot"", but the song has only the barest of verses and the repetition of the word ""hangknot"" becomes quickly tedious. Despite the righteous ""Tear The Fascists Down"" and ""When the Yanks Go Marching In"", most of these songs sound barely agitated at all.</p>
<p>Full of spirited run-throughs of songs he learned from his Uncle Jeff Guthrie and from his travels through the folk circuit, ""Woody's Roots"" and ""Woody, Cisco &amp; Sonny"" comprise a more engaged and much more charming half of the box set. Guthrie offers a series of snapshots of poverty on the nineteenth-century parlor ballad ""A Picture form Life's Other Side"" and tall tales on ""Stackolee"", which finds a bit of humor in all that violence. By contrast, Houston's guitar trills beautifully on the funereal ""Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone?"" while ""Hard Ain't It Hard"" and the Carter Family's ""Worried Man Blues"" are mournful meditations on heartbreak marked by Guthrie's soulfully downcast vocals. Houston appears on most of the songs on ""Roots"", but their sessions with Terry sound more like a lark, launching into loose rags, medleys, and breakdowns with merry abandon. Terry is a dynamic addition to their dueling guitars, and his harmonica provides an organlike backdrop on ""Do You Ever Think of Me (aka At My Window)"" and doggedly chases the guitar on ""Brown's Ferry Blues"" as Guthrie calls out for him to repeat his solo.</p>
<p>That fourth disc presents a very different side of Guthrie than is glimpsed elsewhere on this set. In fact, the folkie comes across as a highly complex artist on <i>My Dusty Road</i>, with all of his affectations and contradictions fully intact and in some cases even reinforced. However, one wonders how the set would have fared if it re-created these sessions rather than imposing such artificial categories onto the music. It too neatly compartmentalizes Guthrie's populist preaching from his more playful performances, his outrage from his joy. The man himself was never so organized; that he could sing a grave union ballad after a nonsensical number makes him seem very real even so many years after his death, despite the pains he took to create and sustain his folkie persona. By dividing the sessions into what amounts to an overview of his career, <i>My Dusty Road</i> detracts from the recently discovered source material, making it both an incredible find and a missed opportunity.</p></div>"|13778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13778-my-dusty-road/|7.3|Stephen M.

Nevertheless, their 2005 debut <i>The Back Room</i> had singles like ""Blood"" and ""Munich"" that were tightly-coiled enough to honor their post-punk influences while being hooky enough to serve as a good entry-level primer. But like so many of their peers (I'm looking at you, British Sea Power), by album two they didn't let loose so much as get bloated, showing the smug healing powers of victory lap-era U2 without the years of artistic restlessness that earned it. Nonetheless, they play stadiums, so they're hardly the most likely candidates to do a complete about-face this far in. So give 'em credit here for going a long way towards dismantling what we've come to know about Editors. Chris Urbanowicz's windy tremolo riffs are mostly forsaken in favor of defiantly sterile washes of synths, the itchy 16th-note hi-hats are replaced by ticky-tack drum machines, and bass is now a lead instrument. Thanks to Flood's production, <i>In This Light and on This Evening</i> is still arena-aspiring in a early-1980s Depeche Mode sort of way, despite the emphasis on relatively primitive electronics.</p>
<p>But with Tom Smith out front, it's like an early-80s Depeche Mode where ""Master and Servant"" is a turgid dirge about oppressive shadow governments and the hopes they squash. While we're on the subject of servitude, no matter what goes on behind him, every song is at the mercy of Smith. He's always sounded like a karaoke rendering of ""Atrocity Exhibition"", but more than ever, his delivery is imbued with a mojo risin' camp which only goes to emphasize lyrics that fall apart under the slightest bit of scrutiny. Which I guess is something of a gift: not everyone delivers your rebellious 15-year old cousin's next Facebook status-- ""living out our second-hand clichés""-- completely straightfaced like Smith does on ""Like Treasure"".</p>
<p>I could spend the rest of this review dropping jewels from ""You Don't Know Love"", but I key on the kick Smith gives the line ""you were the truth... <i>when you lied</i>,"" a convenient summary of the dominant themes of portent and nonsense. The queasy intro of ""The Big Exit"" sounds promising enough in its willingness to imbue dissonance to <i>In This Light</i>'s otherwise hermetic sound, but midway through, Smith moans ""Damn the passing hours/ Damn the summer flowers,"" before trying to hammer home the rhyme ""They took what once was ours,"" repeating it incessantly as if he's trying to figure out what he himself means by that. ""The Boxer"" dolls itself up with pretty-in-pink synth dots, and I <i>guess</i> it might be an Editors party song-- Smith at least acknowledges human connection by intoning a silly joke (""This place is a prison/ And its cells are the bars."") But immediately thereafter, ""Take me to the town/ I want to dance with the city/ Show me something ugly/ Show me something pretty"" is quite possibly the best Interpol parody since <i>Our Love to Admire</i>.</p>
<p>It's sort of a catch-22 that Editors can write songs sticky enough to be memorable in unfortunate ways-- ""kicks like a sleep twitch"" is the sort of stray line that Juelz Santana might chuckle an ad-lib over, not something you should build your first single around. And yet, while the synth progression of first single ""Papillon"" cops heavily from ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"", the beat drops out completely so Smith can stress that very lyric, warning you that you'll be hearing it a lot more before the song's over. Likewise, a song called ""Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool"" pretty much ensures itself a failure; it's got the snappiest hook on the album, but every other part of the song plays out like a half-assed riff on ""Myxomatosis"". Whether the six-minute ""Bricks and Mortar"" copped influence from krautrock or just the last Horrors album is beside the point-- as Smith bellows ""pour saltwater onto the wound,"" he's throwing his arms around the world and feeling nothing.</p>
<p>I used the phrase ""entry level"" earlier, and I keep on thinking of that term when trying to figure out the appeal of Editors. You know that kid in your dorm who took a semester's worth of intro lit and philosophy classes as a license to use the word ""Kafka-esque"" at every opportunity? <i>In This Light and on This Evening</i> is for that guy.</p></div>"|13597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13597-in-this-light-and-on-this-evening/|3.7|Ian Cohen

Its aesthetic is built on a bedrock of retro house and future disco. It tends to like the flashy, upbeat, and stylish; the play of wiry digital sequences against brightly buffed analog electronics or sculpted guitars; pop-culture nostalgia and ingenuous good-life anthems. Its catalog leaves plenty of room for electro-pop, indie rock, and indefinable left-field music, provided that it has a certain chic air, polished production, and at least a toe on the dance floor. It's eclectic, but not in a haphazard way: Wherever cool people make music for other cool people to dance to, remix, and recognize while boutique-shopping, Kitsuné is there.</p>
<p>Despite this variety, the makeup of their compilations is remarkably consistent. They always contain one or two rising stars (prior installments caught Phoenix, Hot Chip, Klaxons, and Bloc Party at ideal moments), some killer tracks that are either too techno or too weird to get really popular, and a bunch of stuff that would at least perk up your ears on ""Gossip Girl"" or at Urban Outfitters. This installment is no exception. Memory Tapes' ""Bicycle"" fills the breakout slot-- while he's unlikely to go on to Phoenix-caliber stardom, he's one of the signal acts of the emergent glo-fi genre. A couple of other standout tracks also get in on the endless summer that was 2009. French Horn Rebellion's ""Up All Night"" is a great opener-- irresistible, panting synth-pop, with fat new wave key tones and ecstatic vocals. And the Drums' ""Let's Go Surfing"", a delicious ""Young Folks""-meets-""Misirlou"" bon bon, maintains its winking yet earnest 50s feel flawlessly; the ""down by the rollercoaster"" break is especially contrived and convincing. They're like a Kitsuné version of Surfer Blood, with mannered aesthetics standing in for messy abandon.</p>
<p>There are a number of entries in the cool-but-obscure camp this year. Siriusmo's ""High Together"" is an exciting ride-- cosmic disco that swoops down into hair-raising minor keys, as if Pantha du Prince had designed the music for Space Mountain. Le Corps Mince de Françoise's funky odd-pop number ""Something Golden"" sounds like something Micachu might have cobbled together, with bolt-action percussion accents and barnyard vocals. Slagsmålsklubben's brainy ""Brutal Weapons"" plinks and mangles like a tech-house kalimba, with lots of shapely pitch-bends. Promising new signing Delphic offer the forthcoming single ""This Momentary"", a streaming, dreamy electro-pop track with a blatantly emotional appeal. Midnight Juggernaut's ""This New Technology"" is an interesting wild card, a big blowsy guitar anthem with those ubiquitous zippering scales (hey, more glo-fi signifiers!) tracing icy whorls in the chorus. And Heartsrevolution's ""Dance Till Dawn"", a vocoder-glazed 80s flashback that's all neon reflected in chrome, swaggers persuasively. These tracks testify to the label's range, although the handful of negligible ones point out its limitations-- even turbo-charged sparkle can get played out at length.</p>
<p>There's nothing truly bad here, although Crystal Fighters' tweaky ""I Love London"", which seems to be trying to vibrate its own frame off, might set your teeth on edge if you catch it in the wrong moment. But some tracks just dissolve into a sugary, distractedly pleasurable sense of conspicuous consumption and wanton eighties-humping. The remixes aren't very exciting this time around-- Harvard Bass' version of Beni's ""Maximus"" has a hot bass line and not much else. Ditto for Moulinex's remix of Two Door Cinema Club's ""I Can Talk"". Alex Kapranos turns in the best retrofit: A widescreen take on Chew Lips' ""Salt Air"", beaming with revelatory synths. And there's little to be said for ""Control"", Nottee's mildly dull Italo-tropical plodder, or ""I Am the Sound"", My Tiger My Timing's winsome electro-funk closer, except that they keep the urban <i>bon vivant</i> aura intact for a little while longer. <i>Kitsuné Maison 8</i> lacks the insane highs of some prior comps, but its consistency testifies to the label's ongoing vitality.</p></div>"|13773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13773-kitsune-maison-8/|7.0|Brian Howe

Guitarist Bernard Butler never embarked on a lackluster solo career, singer Brett Anderson wasn't compelled to follow suit, and neither saw the need to reconvene as the inconsequential Tears. While we're at it, Suede never would have had that awkward and lame ""London"" affixed to their name in the U.S., either (thanks, anonymous coffeehouse singer!).</p>
<p>Back in the real world, however, Suede doesn't carry nearly as much cachet as Britpop mainstays Oasis, Blur, or even Pulp, and in turn Brett Anderson's solo career hasn't been afforded nearly as much attention as, say, Albarn's post-Blur experiments. Then again, Anderson hasn't made a particularly strong case for himself as a solo act, either, debuting with 2007's prematurely autumnal self-titled debut and continuing with the next year's spare, dour <i>Wilderness</i>, which found him wandering the same. Sure, they were both clearly by the Suede guy, but at the same time, they were different. Or at least, Anderson was.</p>
<p><i>Slow Attack</i>, Anderson's third solo album, doesn't mark a return to Suede territory, either, but it does find Anderson increasingly confident and comfortable as a solo artist, especially in this particularly morose mode. Featuring Leo Abrahams as Anderson's primary collaborator and (reportedly) Talk Talk as an inspiration, Anderson finds in Mark Hollis' ineffable melancholia the right template for his own gloomy but oddly warm compositions. The Talk Talk influence manifests itself mainly in Anderson's embrace of woodwinds and droning strings, but also in the way Anderson feels little pressure to reach the cheap seats, taking some risk in leaving melodies intriguingly unresolved, and the arrangements more open-ended.</p>
<p>""The Hunted"" and ""Summer"", for example, could easily have been glammed up into familiar grand rock ballads, but Anderson keeps things restrained, trading bombast for patient and grace. Elsewhere Anderson alludes to traditional folk with songs such as ""Wheatfields"" and Frozen Roads"" without resorting to outright aping his influences (which Suede shamelessly had no problem doing). ""Pretty Widows"" and ""Ashes of Us"" quietly expand on the piano-based palette of ""Wilderness"" as Anderson embraces darkness and grey skies with none of the larger-than-life rock star lifer narcissism that marked his previous band.</p>
<p>Of course, some, especially those looking for a little of the old swagger, would point to those qualities as signs of Anderson's failure, and indeed compared to Suede's ace catalog some of these songs may come off unduly po-faced in their pastoral drift. But if his first two solo albums came across self-conscious refutations of his roots, Anderson was at least brave enough to stick to his guns. <i>Slow Attack</i> doesn't always make sense in the context of Suede, but as far as solo Anderson goes, this album marks a logical next step in his transformation. Slow and steady, it's a promising sign of progress.</p></div>"|13761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13761-slow-attack/|7.0|Joshua Klein

In addition to a new studio LP, 2009 has seen the release of the green-car concept album <i>Fork in the Road</i>, a new live set (<i>Dreamin' Man Live '92</i>), and of course the 10-disc Blu-Ray/DVD/CD extravaganza <i>Archives Vol. 1</i>, which documents the first 10 years of his musical life.  Not to mention that just over a year ago <i>Sugar Mountain - Live at Canterbury House 1968</i> came out, so that even seems relatively new. We're drowning in Neil Young this year, which for hardcore fans (and it seems like the percentage of his fanbase that meets this criteria increases every year) isn't such a bad thing.</p>
<p>Add to the above the ""Neil Young Archives Official Release Series,"" which is the umbrella term for the wholesale reissue of Young's catalog in remastered form. The first four albums, from 1968's <i>Neil Young</i> to 1972's <i>Harvest</i>, were released on CD under the banner a few months back, which made the <i>Archives</i> set even more confusing than it seemed initially. Since much of <i>Archives</i> turned out to be previously issued material, with some albums appearing almost in their entirety, it stood to reason that it would serve as the best way to hear these songs for a while. Anyone ponying up between $100 and $300 for <i>Archives</i> surely already had all those albums, and they'll probably want the better-sounding versions in their original form, too. Young, like Bob Dylan, is almost impossible to read as far as stuff like this goes. It's easy to say that he's ripping people off by getting them to buy the same music over and over. But so many of his puzzling moves over the years, such as refusing to put out <i>On the Beach</i> on CD even though fans were clamoring for it, would seem to be to his financial detriment.</p>
<p>Here's one more for the shelf: the first four albums have been packaged in two limited edition box sets. The CD version is pressed on 24-karat gold discs, and the packaging is new; the vinyl is pressed on 180-gram records (as opposed to 140-gram for the standard issue of the LPs). The vinyl set, which is what I listened to for this review, is going for $150, which certainly isn't cheap. It packages the records in extra-heavy gatefold sleeves that will probably outlive me, and includes full-size reproductions of the original inserts, but there's no extra documentation otherwise. For me, there's an irony in listening to these deluxe versions, because I've long regarded used vinyl copies of <i>Harvest</i> as a litmus test for record stores. If they're selling a used copy in excellent shape for $4 or $5, it's my kind of shop; if they're selling it for $8 or $9, I'm probably somewhere in the New York Metropolitan Area. Fact is, <i>Harvest</i> was the #1 selling album of 1972, and it continued to sell all through the 1970s. Literally millions of copies were pressed, and used copies are very easy to find. It's a record that shouldn't cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>Which is not to say it's not a <i>great</i> record. All four of these albums, in fact, are excellent-- records that everyone should have in their collection eventually, in whatever format. I say ""eventually"" because Neil Young is an artist you shouldn't force yourself to get into; his most devoted fans are so convinced of his genius, and so bent on tracking down every last bootleg, that it's easy to hear a few songs and decide that Young isn't such a big deal. Sometimes it can just take a little while to come around to his music, and you need to be in the right frame of mind.</p>
<p><i>Harvest</i>, whatever your copy ends up costing you, closed out one of the stronger four-album career-opening runs in pop history. Of course, Young had some practice before he went solo, so he had a head start. After gigging around Canada as a teenager in the garage-rock outfit the Squires, he headed out to L.A. and hooked up with the newly forming Buffalo Springfield in 1966. They were a band with a few songwriters, each of whom had their own personality, and Young's songs (""For What It's Worth"", the group's biggest hit, wasn't one of them) revealed an emerging and distinctive voice. In 1968, he left the band and started his solo career, releasing <i>Neil Young</i> at the end of the year.</p>
<p>The album bearing only Neil Young's name is the one that sounds least like him. It's a fine psych-tinged folk-rock set with colorful arrangements and top-shelf instrumental contributors like guitarist Ry Cooder and visionary keyboardist and arranger Jack Nitzsche, who would continue to work with Young periodically through the 70s. But Young himself sounds oddly tentative throughout, as if he weren't quite sure what he wanted his music to sound like, and this is his most restrained singing on record. There are echoes of the great music to come, like the ballad ""The Old Laughing Lady"", and the arrangements are lush and inviting, but <i>Neil Young</i> in a sense represents a road not taken, and it's most interesting now in comparison to what was to come.</p>
<p>The opening riff to ""Cinnamon Girl"", the song that kicks off <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>, erases the memory of <i>Neil Young </i>completely in about five seconds. In the months following the release of his debut, Young hooked up with a ragtag trio of musicians from a band called the Rockets, renamed them Crazy Horse, and found his <i>raison d'être</i>. Where the performances on <i>Neil Young</i> were eminently professional, the sophisticated and exacting parts executed with polished precision, Crazy Horse were loose and sloppy, privileging groove and feeling above all. Many of Young's seasoned contemporaries considered them an embarrassment, but for him they represented a new way of thinking about music, one that favored intuition and stayed true to the moment. A year later he would hook up with the hugely successful Crosby, Stills and Nash; Young would eventually call CSNY his Beatles, while Crazy Horse was his Stones. By this logic, they were making music on the level of <i>Sticky Fingers</i> from the jump.</p>
<p>Discussion of <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i> usually gravitates toward the two extended guitar workouts, ""Down By the River"" and ""Cowgirl in the Sand"". Both are masterpieces of rock minimalism, demonstrating the power of repetition as the Crazy Horse rhythm section of Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot cycle through the chords and Young solos endlessly in his grimy, deeply-felt tone, playing off the subtle, prodding rhythm work of guitarist Danny Whitten. But the more compressed and accessible moments on the record are just as powerful. The title track is a brash, rollicking country-rocker in the vein of the Band, while ""Round &amp; Round (It Won't Be Long)"" is a gorgeous acoustic ballad that finds Young, Whitten, and violinist Robin Lane engaged in three-part harmony on the achingly slow chorus. Best of all on <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>, Young sounds comfortable and confident, singing with the versatile (and hugely influential) voice that has changed remarkably little in the 40 years since.</p>
<p><i>Everybody Knows</i> was a sort of big bang for Young, a dense moment of creative explosion that saw possibilities expanding in every direction. So its follow-up was anything but a retread. With his newfound confidence, Young was poised to stretch, and <i>After the Gold Rush</i> sounds a bit like an overview of the Great American Songbook but with one guy writing almost all the songs. Members of Crazy Horse appear in various combinations on a few of tracks, and songs like ""Southern Man"" and ""When You Dance I Can Really Love"" have the hypnotically stoned but sneakily intense groove of the previous record. But more precisely crafted songs like ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"", ""Birds"", and especially the astonishing title track, which has become a rock standard, show Young's gift as a writer of original melodies of extraordinary beauty in full flower. It's an aspect of Young's work that can be overlooked: the guy can write a simple tune over a chord change that hollows you out completely. Sure, the record has a phrase or two that might sound a little dippy to those with an aversion to hippies (Young was one of those, though of a very individualistic sort), but <i>After the Gold Rush</i> is basically unassailable. There's a reason why it's the favorite Neil Young album for so many.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to <i>Harvest</i>, Young's mainstream breakthrough. Stepping away from Crazy Horse and hooking up with Nashville session musicians he dubbed the Stray Gators, <i>Harvest</i> finds Young experimenting again with a richer, more painstaking studio sound, but one informed by the spontaneity he'd found so inspiring. It's probably his best <i>sounding</i> album, and the ear tends to gravitate to the rhythm section in particular, as bassist Tim Drummond and drummer Kenny Buttrey are almost absurdly in the pocket throughout. (Here I should note that, while they certainly cost a lot of money, the vinyl pressings of these four albums live up to the hype: whisper quiet and clear but full and punchy-- these records have never sounded better).</p>
<p>But Young's songs, though not up to the level of <i>Gold Rush</i>, continue his winning streak. ""Out on the Weekend"" and the title track set the table for a mellow, rootsy, and breezily melodic album, which later songs like ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Are You Ready for the Country"" continue, but <i>Harvest</i> has a more tormented side as well. ""A Man Needs a Maid"", recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra, is one of his stranger creations, an affecting portrait of loneliness undercut with a clumsy, lunkheaded chorus refrain, the sincerity of which has never been quite clear. ""Old Man"" is something of a signature song, laying out the wizened, long-view outlook that didn't fit with his chronological age (by the time of the record's release, Young was 26). And then there's harrowing and radiant ""The Needle and the Damage Done"": at just over two minutes, it's far too short, almost painfully so, just like the lives of the junkies it was written about. Soon enough, two people close to Young, Crazy Horse's Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry, would die from drugs.</p>
<p>The unexpected success of <i>Harvest</i>, combined with the grief and guilt Young felt after Whitten and Berry died, would send Young into a dark and raw place with his next few records as he famously ""headed for the ditch"" to escape the middle of the road. Hereafter, an always-fascinating mix of success and failure would define Young's career, and along the way he'd make some pretty lousy records along with the great ones. To embrace Young as an artist after <i>Harvest</i> would mean accepting his many flaws (including the questionable business decisions, like the many confusing releases of this year), which have made his career unusually rich and varied as well as maddeningly inconsistent. But all that would come later. Enjoying this brilliant four-album run requires no special commitment.</p></div>"|13771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13771-neil-young-everybody-knows-this-is-nowhere-after-the-gold-rush-harvest/|7.8|Mark Richardson

(Here I should note that, while they certainly cost a lot of money, the vinyl pressings of these four albums live up to the hype: whisper quiet and clear but full and punchy-- these records have never sounded better).</p>
<p>But Young's songs, though not up to the level of <i>Gold Rush</i>, continue his winning streak. ""Out on the Weekend"" and the title track set the table for a mellow, rootsy, and breezily melodic album, which later songs like ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Are You Ready for the Country"" continue, but <i>Harvest</i> has a more tormented side as well. ""A Man Needs a Maid"", recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra, is one of his stranger creations, an affecting portrait of loneliness undercut with a clumsy, lunkheaded chorus refrain, the sincerity of which has never been quite clear. ""Old Man"" is something of a signature song, laying out the wizened, long-view outlook that didn't fit with his chronological age (by the time of the record's release, Young was 26). And then there's harrowing and radiant ""The Needle and the Damage Done"": at just over two minutes, it's far too short, almost painfully so, just like the lives of the junkies it was written about. Soon enough, two people close to Young, Crazy Horse's Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry, would die from drugs.</p>
<p>The unexpected success of <i>Harvest</i>, combined with the grief and guilt Young felt after Whitten and Berry died, would send Young into a dark and raw place with his next few records as he famously ""headed for the ditch"" to escape the middle of the road. Hereafter, an always-fascinating mix of success and failure would define Young's career, and along the way he'd make some pretty lousy records along with the great ones. To embrace Young as an artist after <i>Harvest</i> would mean accepting his many flaws (including the questionable business decisions, like the many confusing releases of this year), which have made his career unusually rich and varied as well as maddeningly inconsistent.

In addition to a new studio LP, 2009 has seen the release of the green-car concept album <i>Fork in the Road</i>, a new live set (<i>Dreamin' Man Live '92</i>), and of course the 10-disc Blu-Ray/DVD/CD extravaganza <i>Archives Vol. 1</i>, which documents the first 10 years of his musical life.  Not to mention that just over a year ago <i>Sugar Mountain - Live at Canterbury House 1968</i> came out, so that even seems relatively new. We're drowning in Neil Young this year, which for hardcore fans (and it seems like the percentage of his fanbase that meets this criteria increases every year) isn't such a bad thing.</p>
<p>Add to the above the ""Neil Young Archives Official Release Series,"" which is the umbrella term for the wholesale reissue of Young's catalog in remastered form. The first four albums, from 1968's <i>Neil Young</i> to 1972's <i>Harvest</i>, were released on CD under the banner a few months back, which made the <i>Archives</i> set even more confusing than it seemed initially. Since much of <i>Archives</i> turned out to be previously issued material, with some albums appearing almost in their entirety, it stood to reason that it would serve as the best way to hear these songs for a while. Anyone ponying up between $100 and $300 for <i>Archives</i> surely already had all those albums, and they'll probably want the better-sounding versions in their original form, too. Young, like Bob Dylan, is almost impossible to read as far as stuff like this goes. It's easy to say that he's ripping people off by getting them to buy the same music over and over. But so many of his puzzling moves over the years, such as refusing to put out <i>On the Beach</i> on CD even though fans were clamoring for it, would seem to be to his financial detriment.</p>
<p>Here's one more for the shelf: the first four albums have been packaged in two limited edition box sets. The CD version is pressed on 24-karat gold discs, and the packaging is new; the vinyl is pressed on 180-gram records (as opposed to 140-gram for the standard issue of the LPs). The vinyl set, which is what I listened to for this review, is going for $150, which certainly isn't cheap. It packages the records in extra-heavy gatefold sleeves that will probably outlive me, and includes full-size reproductions of the original inserts, but there's no extra documentation otherwise. For me, there's an irony in listening to these deluxe versions, because I've long regarded used vinyl copies of <i>Harvest</i> as a litmus test for record stores. If they're selling a used copy in excellent shape for $4 or $5, it's my kind of shop; if they're selling it for $8 or $9, I'm probably somewhere in the New York Metropolitan Area. Fact is, <i>Harvest</i> was the #1 selling album of 1972, and it continued to sell all through the 1970s. Literally millions of copies were pressed, and used copies are very easy to find. It's a record that shouldn't cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>Which is not to say it's not a <i>great</i> record. All four of these albums, in fact, are excellent-- records that everyone should have in their collection eventually, in whatever format. I say ""eventually"" because Neil Young is an artist you shouldn't force yourself to get into; his most devoted fans are so convinced of his genius, and so bent on tracking down every last bootleg, that it's easy to hear a few songs and decide that Young isn't such a big deal. Sometimes it can just take a little while to come around to his music, and you need to be in the right frame of mind.</p>
<p><i>Harvest</i>, whatever your copy ends up costing you, closed out one of the stronger four-album career-opening runs in pop history. Of course, Young had some practice before he went solo, so he had a head start. After gigging around Canada as a teenager in the garage-rock outfit the Squires, he headed out to L.A. and hooked up with the newly forming Buffalo Springfield in 1966. They were a band with a few songwriters, each of whom had their own personality, and Young's songs (""For What It's Worth"", the group's biggest hit, wasn't one of them) revealed an emerging and distinctive voice. In 1968, he left the band and started his solo career, releasing <i>Neil Young</i> at the end of the year.</p>
<p>The album bearing only Neil Young's name is the one that sounds least like him. It's a fine psych-tinged folk-rock set with colorful arrangements and top-shelf instrumental contributors like guitarist Ry Cooder and visionary keyboardist and arranger Jack Nitzsche, who would continue to work with Young periodically through the 70s. But Young himself sounds oddly tentative throughout, as if he weren't quite sure what he wanted his music to sound like, and this is his most restrained singing on record. There are echoes of the great music to come, like the ballad ""The Old Laughing Lady"", and the arrangements are lush and inviting, but <i>Neil Young</i> in a sense represents a road not taken, and it's most interesting now in comparison to what was to come.</p>
<p>The opening riff to ""Cinnamon Girl"", the song that kicks off <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>, erases the memory of <i>Neil Young </i>completely in about five seconds. In the months following the release of his debut, Young hooked up with a ragtag trio of musicians from a band called the Rockets, renamed them Crazy Horse, and found his <i>raison d'être</i>. Where the performances on <i>Neil Young</i> were eminently professional, the sophisticated and exacting parts executed with polished precision, Crazy Horse were loose and sloppy, privileging groove and feeling above all. Many of Young's seasoned contemporaries considered them an embarrassment, but for him they represented a new way of thinking about music, one that favored intuition and stayed true to the moment. A year later he would hook up with the hugely successful Crosby, Stills and Nash; Young would eventually call CSNY his Beatles, while Crazy Horse was his Stones. By this logic, they were making music on the level of <i>Sticky Fingers</i> from the jump.</p>
<p>Discussion of <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i> usually gravitates toward the two extended guitar workouts, ""Down By the River"" and ""Cowgirl in the Sand"". Both are masterpieces of rock minimalism, demonstrating the power of repetition as the Crazy Horse rhythm section of Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot cycle through the chords and Young solos endlessly in his grimy, deeply-felt tone, playing off the subtle, prodding rhythm work of guitarist Danny Whitten. But the more compressed and accessible moments on the record are just as powerful. The title track is a brash, rollicking country-rocker in the vein of the Band, while ""Round &amp; Round (It Won't Be Long)"" is a gorgeous acoustic ballad that finds Young, Whitten, and violinist Robin Lane engaged in three-part harmony on the achingly slow chorus. Best of all on <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>, Young sounds comfortable and confident, singing with the versatile (and hugely influential) voice that has changed remarkably little in the 40 years since.</p>
<p><i>Everybody Knows</i> was a sort of big bang for Young, a dense moment of creative explosion that saw possibilities expanding in every direction. So its follow-up was anything but a retread. With his newfound confidence, Young was poised to stretch, and <i>After the Gold Rush</i> sounds a bit like an overview of the Great American Songbook but with one guy writing almost all the songs. Members of Crazy Horse appear in various combinations on a few of tracks, and songs like ""Southern Man"" and ""When You Dance I Can Really Love"" have the hypnotically stoned but sneakily intense groove of the previous record. But more precisely crafted songs like ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"", ""Birds"", and especially the astonishing title track, which has become a rock standard, show Young's gift as a writer of original melodies of extraordinary beauty in full flower. It's an aspect of Young's work that can be overlooked: the guy can write a simple tune over a chord change that hollows you out completely. Sure, the record has a phrase or two that might sound a little dippy to those with an aversion to hippies (Young was one of those, though of a very individualistic sort), but <i>After the Gold Rush</i> is basically unassailable. There's a reason why it's the favorite Neil Young album for so many.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to <i>Harvest</i>, Young's mainstream breakthrough. Stepping away from Crazy Horse and hooking up with Nashville session musicians he dubbed the Stray Gators, <i>Harvest</i> finds Young experimenting again with a richer, more painstaking studio sound, but one informed by the spontaneity he'd found so inspiring.

Their announcement came across as unceremonious and humble-- they revealed they'd promised themselves they'd quit if they couldn't give the band 100%. If the party was coming down, however, one couldn't tell from the sound of <i>Klang</i>. Their previous record, 2007's <i>Ten New Messages</i>, saw the band branch out from their then-fashionable post-punk guitar-rock into electronic textures and more topical lyrics, and the results were a little mixed. Here, the band returns to its comfort zone, for better or for worse. From the start of the record, it sounds mostly for the better:  On opener ""You're in It"", singer Alan Donohoe veers from exaggerated crooning to desperate yelps, and while the music treads the same pattern, the guitar tone is drier and the rhythm section starts and stops in fits; the band sounds more nervous and urgent than before. ""That's the Reason"" follows with a breathless tempo and just a touch of chirping keyboards in a chorus that's relentlessly catchy.</p>
<p>While the Rakes have forgotten some of the better elements of their earlier records, the songs are still thankfully there. From the fast and smirking openers to liberal la-la-la's in the chorus of ""1989"" or the melodic bass thump of ""The Light of Your Mac"", <i>Klang </i>is a record of simple, memorable tunefulness. Lyrically, it comes across like the working-class perspective of their debut-- they're still writing what they know. ""That's the Reason"" weighs the pros and cons of leaving friends to chase after the unexpected, but hints that it's the search for something more lasting that has the narrator running off. They regain a good bit of the mania and charm of their early singles and debut, but <i>Klang</i> misses some of Donohoe's earlier eye for sharp detail that made that perspective more believable. ""The Light of Your Mac"" is a funny telling of a relatable situation, but among the hand-wringing and tiptoing around flatmates, the title is probably its most distinctive detail.</p>
<p>So this is-- or was-- the Rakes stripping down and kicking out the jams, as it were, by glossing over some things to be sure to deliver on others. The band's sonic palette is slightly wider, with acoustic guitars in the breakdown of ""Shackleton"" and an urgent piano march in ""The Woes of the Working Woman"". It's a shame the Rakes stopped just as they were starting to sound fun again, but if they had to end it while they still had that last spark of fun left, it's a better decision than most successful bands can bring themselves to make. A few outstanding singles is more than most bands can ask for-- maybe even more valuable than that is knowing when to end a good run.</p></div>"|13755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13755-klang/|6.1|Jason Crock

Sure, BYOP were a rowdy bunch, but without frontwoman Jemina Pearl to keep the boys classy, they were given license to get even more lewd and obnoxious than usual, and the result was a record that was like the musical equivalent of a filthy off-campus apartment shared by a bunch of gleefully immature young single dudes. <i>Echo Kid</i>, the band's first album since Be Your Own Pet's dissolution last year, is a bit different. They're still a balls-out garage rock outfit, but main man Jonas Stein has refined his voice, sharpened his chops, and penned an album that can be loosely described as ""suave."" You'd never want to call this stuff mature, but they've definitely grown up a bit.</p>
<p>Stein doesn't come close to Pearl's level of bratty charisma, but he's got a solid voice for British Invasion-inspired rock, and is especially good at affecting a playful, lascivious tone without tipping over into skeevy, unsexy Louis XIV territory. The most appealing thing about him is that, as much as he plays the horny flirt on songs like ""Naked With You"" and ""Lotta Lotta Ladies"", he comes off like a decent, respectful guy rather than some dumbass creep. In fact, Stein is kind of a sweetheart. This is most apparent on the tender yet snappy ballad ""Hold Me"", which I imagine is exactly the kind of song girls hope to have written about them by their rock-dude crushes. ""My Stupid Heart"", a gentle slow dance number, is even more corny and old-fashioned, but he's sincere enough that it doesn't just seem like an empty smirk of a tune.</p>
<p>When Turbo Fruits get riled up, as on the opening track ""Want Some Mo'"" and ""Trouble!"", they build up a good energy, but it's noticeably different from what they went for on their debut or what Stein wrote as a member of Be Your Own Pet. He's set aside the cartoon violence and manic jolting rhythms, and settled into a relatively subtle quasi-rockabilly vibe. The songs are just as dynamic, but the music has more room to breathe, allowing for pretty melodic arpeggios and clever touches like the whistled hook in ""Mama's Mad Cos I Fried My Brain"".</p>
<p>To some extent, you've heard this all before. There's not a lick, hook, or lyric on <i>Echo Kid</i> that won't give you a feeling of déjà vu, but the execution is strong and the music is pleasurable enough that it hardly matters. To complain about a lack of originality here would be like bitching about cheeseburgers being more or less the same at every diner. Actually, this album is just like a diner cheeseburger: Cheesy, greasy, bloody, goes good with beer. It may not the best example of its kind, but it's satisfying all the same.</p></div>"|13768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13768-echo-kid/|6.4|Matthew Perpetua

I will suffer through their most meandering fusion-pastiche jams if it means reaching one of their Wagner-by-way-of-<i>Dark Magus</i> climaxes. But even I have to admit there are times where I wish Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodriguez-López still had a couple of meat-and-potatoes punk-types around to act as foils. Not to equate the dudes from Sparta with Teo Macero, but at least in the At the Drive-In days you never worried you were footing the bill for someone's wah-wah pedal obsession.</p>
<p>If you're already suspicious of the MV's concept album corpulence, then the idea of a solo project from one of the band's principals, freed from even the loosest commercial restraints, might seem like a definite no-go. And guitarist Omar Rodriguez-López's glut of one-man-band releases this decade-- this is his <i>fifth</i> solo album released in 2009 alone-- have indeed tended toward the sort of free-form/cut-up/noise-for-the-sake-of-it ""experiments"" that even Volta-lovers might listen to once-and-only-once out of fannish respect. Which is why it's a bit of a surprise that <i>Xenophanes</i> may be the tightest Volta-related product since <i>De-Loused in the Comatorium</i>, back when the tunes were still more riff than solo.</p>
<p>And clearing away the show-off instrumental density-- it's admittedly hard to make claims for the Volta's sense of nuance when 900 people are wailing away in semi-unison, a racket that's often easy to mistake for a Latin-tinged prog band covering <i>The</i> <i>Omen</i> soundtrack-- reveals a delicacy to Omar's music that may surprise. Throw a slo-mo disco beat under the quiet storm of atmospherics in ""Ojo al Cristo de Plata"", and it could be one of those soft-prog/neo-Balearic dance tunes currently so beloved by young house aesthetes. And ""Sangrando Detras de los Ojos"" is actually damned beautiful-- a gentle and even-tempoed instrumental, without an attention-straining time-change in earshot-- akin to ATDI's always stirring breakdowns, the very necessary breathers between the band's attempts to knock the sense out of you.</p>
<p>Of course, with typical Volta-ish perversity, ""Sangrando"" is also the shortest track here. The rest is pretty much what you'd expect: ""funk-rock"" influenced by the guitar FX dogpile of ""Wars of Armageddon"" rather than the streamlined party music of ""Flash Light"" (""Mundo de Ciegos""); portentous melodrama in search of a stadium full of RPG aficionados (""Oremos""); and plinky-plonky electronic miniatures more A-Musik than post-hardcore (""Azoemia""). As always, Rodriguez-López could benefit from an outside editor, since his internal editor seems to have been given his pink slip when ATDI broke up. (There's a <i>sixth</i> solo album arriving before the end of the calendar year.) And only staunch Volta cultists would claim every minute of <i>Xenophanes</i> is worth your precious leisure time. But damn if the best bits don't make an excellent in-car soundtrack for pretending you're on your way to something more dramatic than your day job.</p></div>"|13763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13763-xenophanes/|5.7|Jess Harvell

This 3xCD gospel collection opens with the spry, graceful instrumental performance of the traditional hymn ""Peace in the Valley"", recorded in 1963 by ace lap steel player Rev. Lonnie Farris. It's not the obvious choice for an opener, but serves as a kind of overture. Immediately following is ""Rock and Roll Sermon"", in which Mobile, Alabama's Elder Beck enumerates the evils of secular music and its degenerative effect on good Christian society. Amazingly, the song itself rocks hard, as Beck improvises on Bill Halley's ""Rock Around the Clock"" and an unknown guitar player fires off ferocious hellfire licks. After that Spirit-fueled sermon comes ""If I Could Hear My Mother Pray Again"", a professional recording by Rev. Anderson Johnson that manages to be both restrained and massively moving, his smoothly expressive voice effortlessly conveying his orphan angst.</p>
<p>In just three songs, <i>Fire in My Bones</i> covers a range of musical approaches and emotional expressions: from contented to contemptuous, from professional sessions to field recordings, from fevered shouts to ruminative moans. Gospel, this collection insists, is not one thing but many. The term itself constitutes such a wide umbrella that it may have more to do with the performers and their intentions than with the noises they make. That mission explains some of the curious aspects of the collection, which was curated by writer, archivist, and Pitchfork contributor Mike McGonigal. First, there's that unhelpfully long time frame, which spans the height of World War II through the last days of the Bush II era. What can you say about gospel and its development throughout the 20th century if you're painting with such broad strokes? As a history of the form, <i>Fire in My Bones</i> offers little insight into how it developed across these 63 years. To be fair, though, McGonigal is after more than a simple chronicle of the genre. He eschews the post-war heyday th
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
at many compilers and historians emphasize, setting his sights on the margins of the gospel mainstream.</p>
<p>Those margins are lively and rambunctious, which makes <i>Fire in My Bones</i> an often mind-blowing listening experience-- a <i>Nuggets</i>-style mix from a guy with a deep knowledge of the subject. Disparity is the key theme: On ""Wasn't That a Mystery"", the Madison County Senior Center Singers deliver a mighty call and response, while Rev. G.W. Killens and the Mt. Calvary Congregation achieve a full upswell of wordless sounds-- a truly joyful noise, but also one filled with dark warning. The Abraham Brothers' ""Spirit of the Lord"" possesses a gravitational sway that isn't too far removed from the rockabilly rhythms of the Radio Four's ""How Much I Owe"". Not so much in their subject matter but in the quality of their performances, these recordings make clear these are first and foremost worship songs, but there are many ways to praise God: extolling His power to others, recounting personal experiences and commitments, and deploying a brand of scare tactics that might seem ugly if not set to such rollicking and urgent music.</p>
<p>The musical and emotional diversity of this collection speaks to the range of circumstances under which these songs were performed and recorded, as well as to the variety of African-American experience throughout the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st. These artists made music using whatever resources were available, for whoever was devoted enough to hear them: a professional studio, an archivist's reel-to-reel, a congregation that can double as an instrument, or just a beat-up harmonica. As Tennessee singer Joe Townsend exclaims, ""If I could not say a word, I would just raise my hand."" For showing the many different ways people can raise their hands, <i>Fire in My</i> <i>Bones</i> is an invaluable introduction to the power and breadth of gospel, as wide and disparate as ""rock'n'roll"" or ""hip-hop."" But that lesson isn't this collection's greatest quality. Rather, its true selling point is the intense power of these individual testimonies, which rock, roll, and revel with passion and real fire.</p></div>"|13759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13759-fire-in-my-bones-raw-rare-otherworldly-african-american-gospel-1944-2007/|8.4|Stephen M.

In spite of the success they've achieved in the 2000s, count Clipse amongst that group looking to put the past 10 years behind them: After their manager got arrested for a role in an eight-figure drug ring, some of coke-rap's leading voices were put in the unusual position of having to deny they were coke dealers. While their mid-decade output was in large part defined by a combative relationship with Jive, they're now on Columbia after an ardent courtship. Hell, they don't even seem all that interested in dissing Lil Wayne anymore.</p>
<p>With all that out of the way, when Clipse called themselves the Black Cards, it was because they were guaranteed to raise the bar for hip-hop with every verse. The <i>Road To Till the Casket Drops</i> mixtape actually showcased their punchlines more than their Play Cloths line. They quote Masta Ace. Albums still really matter to them. This is music by rap nerds <i>for </i>rap nerds. Which isn't a bad thing at all! Though <i>Hell Hath No Fury </i>was seen as something of a commercial brick back in 2006, three years later, their model is one that most rap groups would love to emulate.  It galvanized a sustainable fanbase and opened up opportunities to precede Devendra Banhart on a Coachella stage (they ended up skipping it). And they may or may not have exchanged high-fives with Passion Pit at the 2009 mtvU Woodie Awards. So it's understandable if Clipse no longer feel like they have to <i>actually</i> prove shit to anyone, but perhaps that's why <i>Til the Casket Drops </i>awkwardly vacillates between confidence and complacency, between sneering at perceived competition and smarting at perceived and possibly self-made slights.</p>
<p>Prior leaks ""Popular Demand (Popeyes)"" and ""Kinda Like a Big Deal"" feature sensible collaborations with Cam'ron and Kanye West, but might've done more to earn their titles back in, say, 2005-- on the former, a Yuri Gagarin reference is about the only thing that can jar you from Cam's sleepwalking verse, while Kanye does his ""Barry Bonds"" thing, completely stealing the show with the kind of class clown spitballing we've rarely heard from him since <i>The College Dropout</i>. Tellingly, an attempt to contemporize falls flat on ""Showing Out"": I know Clipse had a thing for T.I.'s ""Swing Ya Rag"" (it appeared on the <i>Road To Til the Casket Drops </i>mixtape), but trying to get Pharrell  to duplicate its busy clatter without clearance issues grates, not to mention of their worst verses ever (the Lady Gaga one), and Yo Gotti spitting generic ""go hard, lil' daddy"" hustle raps that go nowhere.</p>
<p>Not only does <i>Til the Casket Drops </i>refuse to settle into a groove, but you know right from opener ""Freedom"" that this is a very different kind of record from Clipse. The first track on a Clipse LP without production by the Neptunes (former Bad Boy associates and <i>American Gangster </i>curators Sean C &amp; LV did it instead), ""Freedom""'s rock star geetar and live drums are a jarring shift from the desiccated, merciless clangor of <i>Hell Hath No Fury</i>. But the schizo production actually fits the uneven topicality as well as the truly dangerous sonics of <i>Hell Hath No Fury </i>fit Clipse's anger. While that album's relatively celebratory tracks (""Dirty Money"", ""Ride Around Shinin"") only amplified the amorality and emptiness that surrounded them, ""Door Man"", ""Never Will It Stop"", and ""Popular Demand (Popeyes)"" defiantly wave knots of hundreds.</p>
<p>Clipse are far weaker at creating what they might term ""lifestyle music,"" which comprises most of <i>Casket</i>'s side B. The mesmerizingly awful ""I'm Good"" is pure Velveeta, and the guys hardly bother to dignify this garishly fluorescent cheese with even a decent punchline. And the problem with the Keri Hilson feature ""All Eyes on Me"" and ""Counseling"" isn't the mere fact that they could pass for late-90s rap'n'b; it's that they could be late-90s softbatch rap'n'b from <i>anyone--</i> Clipse are strangely anonymous in these contexts.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that Clipse are an unusually introspective and self-aware group, but particularly since <i>We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 3</i>, you get the feeling they've been reading too much of their own press, however positive it's been.  They know that some of their own fans have pigeonholed them as strictly criminologists (""Mistook my work for solely crack/ You should've got more out of it than that"") or martyrs in label warfare. (Pusha T describes the ""self-made prison"" of the music business in ""Freedom"" and ends his verse saying, ""my critics finally have a verse of mine to jerk off to."") On the reflective ""Footsteps"", Malice confides that an associate's prison sentence ""weighs on my conscience, and I hate conscious rap."" Earlier, Pusha calls himself ""Common on his 'D-Boy,"" and promising the truth ""no matter how bland it is.""</p>
<p>As fascinating as this self-reckoning can be, it ultimately expresses why <i>Til the Casket Drops </i>is so uneven: It's Clipse questioning their perceived current fans (backpackers who got into ""Grindin'"") while trying to make amends with those they perceive to have lost (girls who got into ""Ma, I Don't Love Her""). They've made a career out of conflict, but I just hope they're not missing the middle (""When the Last Time"", ""Virginia"") because they think it's a comfort zone.</p></div>"|13767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13767-til-the-casket-drops/|6.2|Ian Cohen

Max Fischer, attempting to seduce his teacher by faking a bike crash, pops a cassette of French love songs into the bedside table tape deck while her back is turned. Margot and Richie Tenenbaum, fighting incestuous desires in a child's tent, listen to two tracks off a (mis-sequenced) LP of the Rolling Stones' <i>Between the Buttons</i>. Steve Zissou keeps around a crew member whose sole duty seems to be perpetually covering David Bowie songs.</p>
<p>And since it's not a stretch to assume Anderson sinks a lot of himself into his films-- the titular <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i> wears a mustard-colored corduroy suit I'm sure I've seen the director himself sport-- the intense need for music control may be the most autobiographical detail of all. For like his contemporaries Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson occasionally seems as obsessed with perfecting the film soundtrack as he is with the film itself. You just know Anderson has the music for his parties scripted down to the very minute: <i>11:43-- ""Days"" by the Kinks</i>.</p>
<p>But where QT and PTA, both eager scholars of film history, have habits of recycling music previously used for cinematic purposes, Anderson's musical vocabulary is more alchemical, an often brilliant combination of dusty-groove British Invasion and Mark Mothersbaugh's whimsical scores. Like most great tricks, it rapidly soured to a cliché, making Anderson's multiple slow-motion, Kinks-soundtracked scenes in <i>The Darjeeling Limited</i> risk lapsing into self-parody.</p>
<p>Thankfully then, the soundtrack for <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i> is a different animal altogether, slightly more (groaaan) sly, even if it's still detail-obsessed-- it's on ABKCO Records, for cuss' sake. It's the first original score for a Wes Anderson flick not composed by Mothersbaugh (<i>Darjeeling Limited</i> also lacked the Devo vet, but featured music cobbled from Bollywood films); instead, the more traditional French composer Alexandre Desplat swings the baton. And other than the Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man"" and several Beach Boys songs, Anderson's selections mostly veer a generation earlier than his usual picks to vocal groups, jazz, and, well, a whole lot of Burl Ives.</p>
<p>At first glance, Anderson seemingly commits a Tarantino crime by drawing upon songs already bearing the imprint of other TV shows and movies, but there's a twist-- when they arise in the film, it's as the characters' own song choice. Because what else would funny animated animals listen to but the music of other funny animated animal entertainment? Ives was a fixture in the Rankin/Bass stop-motion holiday specials-- ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and the like. Also featured on the record is the love song from Disney's <i>Robin Hood </i><span>and</span> ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" (not an animal, but wore one on his head)-- each poured hissily out of on-screen radios in the film. The film's humans, meanwhile, sit around a campfire and listen to a puppet version of Jarvis Cocker (in a star cameo as Petey) making up a banjo song. It's cute, and as the movie nicely proves, cute ain't such a bad thing.</p>
<p>Blending well with the quaint folk of Ives and Cocker is Desplat's score, which has all the colorful fancy you'd expect for an Anderson film meant ostensibly for children-- really existentially aware children. At first, banjo-and-strings chamber-music tracks like ""Mr. Fox in the Fields"" and ""Jimmy Squirrel and Co."" make one head-scratch over why Mothersbaugh-- someone with pretty good animation experience already-- wasn't tapped again. But as the film starts genre-hopping merrily through heist flicks, Spaghetti westerns, and war movies, Desplat's wider range helps the soundtrack keep up with the goofy march of ""Whack-Bat Majorette"" or the Morricone goof of ""Just Another Dead Rat in a Garbage Pail"".</p>
<p>Ironically, the only part of <i>Mr. Fox</i>'s music that feels off in the context of the film are the most Andersonish 60s-obsessed moves. Both the Beach Boys' ""Heroes and Villains"" and ""Street Fighting Man"" are jarring anachronisms even in a movie where old-timey badgers use cell phones, and stick out sorely on the record as well. Only the Bobby Fuller Four's ""Let Her Dance"" works in both media-- hopefully Anderson has learned by now that every movie he ever makes should end with all the main characters dancing to a 60s rock tune, as his best two now have. In the other one, Max Fischer, ever the obsessive director, picks ""Ooh La La"" for his last dance with Ms. Cross. With <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i>, Wes Anderson, ever the obsessive soundtracker, creates another value-added souvenir in the spirit of a literally wonderful film.</p></div>"|13758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13758-fantastic-mr-fox-ost/|7.1|Rob Mitchum

These days, of course, things are slightly different. Music from Africa is getting collected, compiled, and re-introduced on a regular country-by-country or scene-by-scene basis. Rock fans are increasingly well versed in the likes of soukos, juju, or mbalax, or the art of the kora and mbira. Heck, the late Fela Kuti, something of a cult act in the States, is currently the subject of a successful Broadway musical.</p>
<p>Still, marketing African acts to the West remains something of an uphill slog, and that goes for established artists as well as new ones. In the past couple of years alone, I've seen both Mali's breakout Amadou &amp; Mariam play to huge festival crowds (encouraging) but also Senegalese legend Youssou N'Dour play a less than capacity club (disheartening). Is it any wonder, then, that acts from throughout African so often seek Western assistance to help break through long-entrenched barriers? Amadou &amp; Mariam, for example, worked with both global-pop keystone Manu Chao and Damon Albarn. Algeria's Rachid Taha regularly works with Steve Hillage. Ali Farka Toure teamed with Ry Cooder. Youssou N'Dour broke through in part thanks to his association with Peter Gabriel. And fellow Senegalese star Baaba Maal has worked with everyone from Brian Eno to reggae legend Ernest Ranglin.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Baaba Maal has embraced most fervently his role as a pan-global fusionist, and his latest, <i>Television</i>, his first studio album since 2001's <i>Missing You (Mi Yeewnii)</i>, is no exception. But while the disc was produced with Barry Reynolds (best known for his work with Grace Jones) and features musical contributions from members of the Brazilian Girls, it's a surprisingly mellow affair, generally tasteful in its eccentricities and outreach to a broader audience.</p>
<p>On the latter front, tracks such as ""Cantaloupe"" and ""International"" come close to kitsch, the first with its cloyingly whistled melodies, the second with its awkward literal-mindedness. ""Dakar Moon"", with its flamenco guitar and English lyrics, too, comes close to crossing over into ill-conceived milquetoast territory. Other songs, however, such as the title track, ""Tindo"", and the atmospheric ""A Song for Women"", smartly and subtly find ways to bridge traditional music with contemporary technology; the song ""Television"", in fact, even concerns the effect of television's arrival in Africa.</p>
<p>But <i>Television</i> is a markedly minor affair, especially once you factor in the long gap between it and its predecessor. Yes, Baaba Maal is in good voice throughout, but that voice all too often blends into the background like just another instrument, its dominance mixed down like he's almost a guest on his own disc, ceding the focus to the quiet interplay of real and programmed percussion, guitars, and synths, and particularly polyglot Brazilian Girl Sabina Sciubba. The results are perfectly pleasant but rarely inspiring, hardly sterile but at the same time too smooth. For a self-professed musical ambassador, the usually magnetic Maal simply seems too restrained, too eager to meet new listeners halfway rather than give them a compelling reason to come to him.</p></div>"|13760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13760-television/|5.8|Joshua Klein

That sounds either like a really fun ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" spinoff pitch or a self-described undergraduate rock project. Naturally it's the latter, but it turns out that <i>Ghost</i>-- the debut from the San Diego three-piece Tape Deck Mountain-- isn't able to turn its premise into something that isn't formulaic. (Come to think of it, unless Joss Whedon really was involved, that fake TV show likely wouldn't either.)</p>
<p>Sadly then one of rising label Lefse Records' marquee fall releases is frustrating thanks to a feeling of rootlessness that stifles any chance of its finding a rhythm. On otherwise top cut ""Dead Doctors Don't Lie"", the band swaps a perfectly tenuous, lumbering 90-second stretch of feedback-slathered post-rock for three and a half minutes of corroded dialogue over an airy woodwind suite. Looped backwards. So it's not to say that Tape Deck Mountain don't have potential-- good chunks of <i>Ghost </i>boast bristly textures and psych-soaked noodlings that feel much richer thanks to surprisingly full-sounding production-- but it's rarely realized here, rendering this collection of songs, for the most part, inert.</p>
<p>Like a sort of extended jam (bookended by two proper-sounding singles, ""Ghost Colony"" and ""Scantrons""-- two of the only songs that seem to truly adhere to the whole ghost/grades theme), most of the tracks bleed into one another, or borrow small pieces from their predecessor and transfigure them slightly, enough so we can discern one portion from another. Much of the spaced-out aimlessness of ""80/20"" is ramped up for that wild first quarter of ""Dead Doctors""; the irritating, bland ""F-"" is followed by the album's real highlight ""On My Honor"", which affords the album some necessary ""bigness"" it sorely lacks. Like an embryonic Spoon demo, ""Honor""'s pre-programmed bossa nova beats and dead-eyed sing-along chorus feel on the money.</p>
<p>However, as with almost everything else on <i>Ghost</i>, that too is swiftly marred by frontman Travis Trevisan's flat, self-aware delivery-- ""Man down, dead on the field/ Wolves eat all of his meat/ Now I know the the pain, and I question the game,"" could've worked as pure camp, but not when presented so pensively. So even in those fleeting moments when there actually is something to sink your teeth into-- the dissonant decay on the back half of ""In the Dirt"" or the spooked-out tones on ""Ghost Colony""-- most of the energy you'll burn exercising these inane couplets from your mind (""Please don't marry that asshole Larry/ I know he'll move the place you're buried, next to me"") provides little patience for much else.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just that Tape Deck Mountain suffer from some rare form of test anxiety. There are plenty of cues to be taken that would lead you to believe that if given a little space, TDM could properly expand some of these ideas and build something more expansive and full, most likely in a live setting. The singles might provide some of the clearest insight here: Opener ""Scantrons"" isn't very memorable, but something in Trevisan's approximation of Ian Curtis' ""Atmosphere""-cribbing lilt, coupled with those portentous drums, produces a feeling of real possibility. Even on the mundane ""Ghost Colony"" (which kind of sounds like a Thursday throw-away at half-speed), the bigger moments-- where guitars crash and sequencers explode-- offer helpful hints. But <i>Ghost</i> rarely does get the hint, often left too slight and too self-important for it's own good. In the future, hopefully TDM will take some time to carefully read the intructions and sharpen those No. 2s before making their mark, heavy and dark.</p></div>"|13757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13757-ghost/|5.1|Zach Kelly

But record stores are on their way out, and perhaps so are those distinctions, thanks in part to Nate Newton. His bands Converge and Doomriders feast on knocking down barriers. Converge, in which he plays bass, come from hardcore punk, but add math rock's angularity and metal's chops. Doomriders, in which Newton sings and plays guitar, also come from hardcore, but add Thin Lizzy's guitar harmonies and Motörhead's high-octane grime. The combination of punk and the 1970s rock it kicked aside might seem odd. But forget the orthodox view of punk as the Ramones/Clash class of '77; Doomriders are really descendants of the Stooges and MC5.</p>
<p>Doomriders' debut, 2005's <i>Black Thunder</i>, wore its 70s influences overtly. It was also slightly tongue-in-cheek, talking about she-wolves and death marches with a wink. The irony level didn't reach that of, say, the Darkness-- Doomriders' live shows are too pummeling to be ironic-- but there was one. On <i>Darkness Come Alive</i>, it's gone. The title is apt, as Newton's demons now have both sonic and lyrical shape. While Gorham/Robertson harmonies still crop up, the songs focus more on lean, hard riffing. ""Bear Witness"" hugs the ground with a sport-tuned two-step, then shifts into a top fuel double-time. ""Come Alive"" is a violent, storm-tossed tribute to Danzig. Riffs are more metallic now (""Rotter"" is half Slayer, half Motörhead), and moody interludes add gloom. Instead of simply bashing it out as before, drums now rumble and grind with shifting speeds. The resulting bombed-out feel is something that Doomriders can rightly call their own.</p>
<p>But for all the rock, metal, and punk in their mix, punk still commands the highest proportion. Newton's lyrics have gotten more personal; ""Lions"" is blunt and admonitory: ""Don't let these fuckers grind you down/ Don't let these bastards kill your soul."" That's as naked as the lyrics get. Newton isn't given to hardcore punk's typical sloganeering. But even when he waxes epic, asking that ""Light of heaven/ Be my shelter/ Please watch over me,"" he's speaking from the heart. His happens to have brass knuckles with wings tattooed over it. Now skin and flesh, though, are of a piece with the wood and metal they wield.</p></div>"|13575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13575-darkness-come-alive/|7.5|Cosmo Lee

Scientists have tested the ability of music to induce sleep in a wide variety of populations, from nurses and elementary school kids to abused women and senior citizens. And perhaps not surprisingly, it usually seems to work, improving parameters like time to sleep onset, nighttime awakenings, and longer sleep duration-- no news to this reviewer, who spent one entire tense year using Sigur Rós as a cheaper form of Ambien.</p>
<p>A lot of these studies are opaque about the specific music actually used to induce sleep, but in one-- a 2005 paper from Case Western Reserve University-- there's a genre rundown: ""synthesizer (new age), harp (eclectic), piano (popular oldies), orchestra (classical), and slow jazz."" <i>Music for Insomnia</i>, the latest in Asthmatic Kitty Records' Library Catalog Music Series, is none of these, though it may perhaps be all of them. Credited to Lowell Brams, the co-founder of Asthmatic Kitty, and featuring contributions from his stepson (and the other co-founder) Sufjan Stevens and Bryce Dessner of the National, it's a record that most definitely would not have been used in any sleep research.</p>
<p>Were <i>Music for Insomnia</i>'s eight abstract tracks to induce sleep, it would likely be a pretty agitated sort. A good two-thirds of the music here is straight-up nightmare fuel, avant-garde experimentalism that resists any traditional rhythmic or melodic landing points and triggers physiological reactions of discomfort and paranoia more than relaxation and peacefulness. Consider opener ""Chattering Garden Trolls"", where even the title suggest a sadistic sort of slumberland. Within, Brams and his compatriots establish the project's palette: a bed of wheezing, dark drones where fragments of drums, guitar, and synthesizer phase in and out, like a box full of instruments falling down a long flight of stairs, very slowly and irregularly. It's sinister as hell, and yet doesn't hold a candle to the feedback shrieks of ""Short Circadian Partita"" or the 12-plus minutes of ""Hypnagogic Hallucination"", where the mélange is joined by the kind of high-pitched piano runs that usually foretell that a sorority girl is about to get stabbed by a dude in a mask.</p>
<p>Also as lengthy is the far more soothing ""Alpha to Theta"", where a pixie-like synthesizer zips through the gaps of fluttery guitar and piano, producing a glittery soundscape reminiscent of Stevens' electronic <i>Enjoy Your Rabbit</i>, though less rhythmic. The only regular-tempo respite of <i>Music for Insomnia</i> is found on ""Dream About Vince Guaraldi"", where a gently chugging preset and an optimistic bassline provides some much-needed structure as the synthesizers frolic and a wah-wah effect chimes in.</p>
<p>Dessner shows up only on the last track, ""A Cross Section of Clown Mountain""-- by far the least busy track on the entire collection and another feedback world. But unlike ""Short Circadian Partita"", Dessner's involvement lends the track some forward motion, journeying from eerie beginnings to finding beauty in the feedback currents at the resolution. It's also the only track that could ethically be used in a study of music and insomnia, as one could easily see a person's tension and consciousness melting away along its quiet path.</p></div>"|13766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13766-music-for-insomnia/|5.3|Rob Mitchum

That's not just because the soundtrack is selling well and getting Sea Wolf's name out to the listening public in general, but more because the kind of person who is most likely to be voraciously devouring the album is also exceedingly susceptible to becoming smitten with the rest of Sea Wolf's oeuvre-- specifically, young people (mostly girls) with a weakness for moody romance and natural imagery. Should any of these <i>Twilight</i> acolytes be compelled by Sea Wolf's <i>New Moon</i> offering, ""The Violet Hour"", to seek out the band's newest album, <i>White Water, White Bloom</i>, they'll be welcomely rewarded with a collection of swoony, melodic songs delivered with aching sincerity by lead singer and songwriter Alex Brown Church, and featuring more sighingly idealized poetic images and symbols than you can shake a stick at-- orchards in the snow, morning dew, constellations, and ""a pheasant's feather,"" just to name a few.</p>
<p>Presumably, anyone a bit older and perhaps musically savvier will hear Sea Wolf and immediately recognize that, sonically at least, they've already heard this all before from Bright Eyes and the Arcade Fire, as <i>White Water, White Bloom</i>, the band's second full-length LP (and first as a proper band and not simply a solo endeavor for Church), breaks no new ground. Opener ""Wicked Blood"" bites the Arcade Fire's exact aesthetic (chugging guitars, swelling strings, quavering vocals, simple but weighty piano melody) to an almost litigious extent, and while the remainder of the album is perhaps not quite as egregious, virtually every song is blatantly beholden to something that's going to be incredibly familiar to any halfway-avid fan of indie-rock. ""Orion &amp; Dog"", ""The Orchard"", and the title track are the cuts most overtly indebted to Conor Oberst (particularly from a vocal standpoint), but Sea Wolf actually pillages inspiration from throughout the entire family tree of literate folk-rock, echoing not only Oberst mentors like Tom Petty (""Turn the Dirt Over"") and R.E.M. (the intro to the title track) but even the granddaddies of the form, the Byrds, on the album-closing ""Winter's Heir"".</p>
<p>I can't deny Church is a solid craftsman capable of cranking out extremely inviting pop-rock hooks, but this ground is so well-trod that it's hard to find anything to get even a little bit excited about here unless you're relatively new to indie-rock patronage. A friend of mine who saw Sea Wolf in concert recently testified to the abundance of young attendees who seemed pretty obviously to have been turned on to the band via <i>New Moon</i>. If nothing else, <i>White Water, White Bloom</i> ought to convince plenty of those kids to join Team Alex.</p></div>"|13749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13749-white-water-white-bloom/|5.0|Joshua Love

They make widescreen music full of big gestures and sweeping melodies, and on this, their third album, they sound bigger than ever. Credit this partially to the addition of a small string section on a few songs, but far more to keyboardist Ned Cooke asserting himself at the heart of the band's sound. He provides huge textural washes and spiky riffs on just about every song, blowing the band's sound up from something that was already big on 2006's <i>Granddance</i> to something that sounds like it could make the jump to a stadium any time it wanted. The arcade fire burns a little Down Under too, apparently.</p>
<p>While Cooke's more prominent role has changed the sonics a bit, the band remains built around the tension between the contrasting styles of guitarist/vocalists Dave Rennick and Tim Derricourt. Rennick is the theatrical one, opening ""The Night Is Young at Heart"" by crooning, ""Would you be open to a night of total chaos?"" shouting the last word of the line at the top of his lungs as Cooke's keyboards squiggle all around him. Derricourt is his calm, straightforward counterpart, delivering the tumbling verses of ""Kid"" in a smooth stream that rises to the rapids of the bashing chorus, and providing a direct foil on ""Miniature Alas"", where he provides the verse and leaves joins Rennick on the chorus, where the two making a distinctive pairing. Derricourt sing out a little more on lead single ""The Price"", possibly because he's competing with the sheet of strings and synthesizer that deliver the song's huge opening theme. The chorus is massive.</p>
<p>While the use of two main vocalists provides instant variety, the band is also keen to explore a variety of moods over the course of the record. ""Don't Stop There"" is the closest thing to a ballad, moving at a spooky crawl, the keyboard theme doubled by a guitar to create a theme that's harmonically off-center and consequently quite otherworldly. Opener ""Hold Your Back"" comes in with a frenetic keyboard part that sounds like a descendent of Yes' ""Changes"" or Pink Floyd's ""One Slip"", but the song moves from there into a pensive, spacey main section that constantly threatens to turn bombastic but never does.</p>
<p>At the other end of the record, big, choral vocals give ""Stepshadows"" a strangely nautical feel over a beat reminiscent of the shuffle of Paul Simon's ""Graceland"". Cooke uses a bizarre trumpet-ish sound for the opening fanfare of ""Wooden Ships"", lending the song a strangely medieval feel behind Derricourt's falsetto verse vocal. Dappled Cities haven't quite acquired a big reputation outside their homeland yet, but it seems likely they will. If they keep making big, boisterous records like this that are unafraid to be a little ridiculous in places, they'll have to.</p></div>"|13623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13623-zounds/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Disappointing to see such a nice-guy band halt like that, but <i>Kids Aflame</i>, the first album from Harlem Shakes guitarist Todd Goldstein, shows that he, at least, has a lot left in him.</p>
<p>Goldstein's solo project ARMS actually predates Harlem Shakes. But this album, which was released in Europe in early 2009 (the U.S. version comes with a couple of bonus tracks), feels as if it were recorded in bedrooms and on borrowed time. And it sounds nothing like Harlem Shakes. There's a lo-fi gauze wrapped around everything, though there are some nice nuances built into the layers. Take ""Whirring"" (the first song proper, following a half-minute of scene-setting texture), which bursts into a jangly, feverish tune with a hook reminiscent of Dinosaur Jr. This sense of familiarity occurs often throughout <i>Kids Aflame</i>, for better and worse. Some of it's due to the mostly unvarying instrumentation, though the sleepy title track is built on a ukulele, while ""Pocket"" gets a second boost of frantic energy from its closing horn melody.</p>
<p><i>Kids Aflame</i> feels like a solo album in another respect: Goldstein captures, in his croony baritone, that mixture of loneliness and anxiety that can come even when you're surrounded by people. Both ""Sad, Sad, Sad"" and ""Shitty Little Disco"" seem to be about that uncomfortable moment at a bad party when you either leave early or stay far, far, too long, drinking in a corner. Other songs are wrapped in metaphor-- Goldstein seems especially captivated by body parts that come in twos. Luckily we have plenty-- ARMS, legs that break, and eyeballs where he would ""...crack those orbs at the seams/ And suck out the juice/ I'd use those eyelashes as brooms to clean up my house."" In that song, ""Eyeball"", Goldstein delivers this quirky-creepy line in the same tone he uses on every other song.</p>
<p>You can hear a little Bright Eyes in the way Goldstein chooses to begin his songs softly, building towards a fuzzy, messy climax. And while I'm no fan of Bright Eyes' melodrama, Goldstein's voice could use a little shaking up.  Even in the first-person stories Goldstein feels like an observer, albeit one with a negative bias. Still, ARMS makes for an interesting contrast to Harlem Shakes' eternal optimism.</p></div>"|13751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13751-kids-aflame/|6.1|Jessica Suarez

You can recommend, say, Burial or Joker to dubstep newbies because at least the former's vocals and the latter's psychedelic touches might provide a way ""in"" to (more or less) instrumental music that can be pretty forbidding in its starkness. How do you review an album like <i>Jarvik Mindstate</i>, which could care less about the needs of listeners from outside the scene, for a general interest-ish publication like Pitchfork without shrugging through a 600 word ""caveat emptor""?</p>
<p>So please understand that <i>Jarvik Mindstate</i> is not an album designed for indie rockers looking to spice up their iPods. Peverelist is making music for people like himself, people who've been following the UK's bass-centric and heavily syncopated post-jungle dance scene for most of its decade-plus history. That said, if you've got the Forward logo tattooed on your forearm and know Zed Bias' real name (without consulting Wikipedia), there are pleasures to be found here, most them nostalgia-based. As someone who's spent far too much money on UK dance imports myself, I enjoy the way the jittery loop on ""Yesterday I Saw the Future"" echoes the ""nature sounds"" ambiance once found on hundreds of Good Looking-era jungle tracks. And the title track is another intriguing, gloom-drunk Bristolian twist on acid house minimalism, just with the BPM turned down a bit since the days of Full Cycle and V.</p>
<p>Faint praise, perhaps, but it'd be fibbing to say these tracks are going to inspire people to grab non-ravers by the lapels and force them to listen. Perhaps, like me, you're a long-time dance fan who still enjoys hearing someone remodel old genres (jungle, techno, IDM) into new shapes (dubstep), provided the producer in question is overflowing with wit/invention/idiosyncracies. Burial wasn't exactly doing much ""new"" either, at least if you'd heard a few Dem 2 and Horsepower Productions singles, something the producer has all but admitted in interviews. But at least he brought his own curious obsessions (that downcast vibe, that weather-beaten fidelity) to the always potentially ignoble art of influence mining. The real problem with <i>Jarvik Mindstate</i> is that there's just not much <i>personality</i> on display. It's a competent genre exercise that hovers right on the dangerous edge between ""pleasant diversion"" and ""inessentiality.""</p></div>"|13765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13765-jarvik-mindstate/|5.5|Jess Harvell

His take on the song is slow and somber, with almost no instrumentation save a bit of percussion. Filling out the sonic space is a recording of an Elvis Presley press conference, which finds him answering a few random questions, including one about what he's been reading. Elvis begins his replies with ""Yes sir"" or ""No sir,"" like the polite Southern boy he was, and he sounds distant, careful not to say anything that might offend. I suspect that Bono included this spoken bit because it represented for him a theme he had explored a few years earlier on U2's ""Elvis Presley and America"", a murky, hazy track found on <i>The Unforgettable Fire</i> that some see as filler but which I've always found fascinating. ""Elvis Presley and America"" and Bono's version of ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" both speak to one of Elvis' fundamental contradictions: How can singer say so much-- through someone else's song, even-- and then find feelings and ideas so hard to articulate away from music?</p>
<p>Elvis now occupies a strange place in music in part because he was never a songwriter. Long ago, of course, very few singers were also writers, but the 1960s changed much of that. After Bob Dylan and the Beatles, there was an expectation that the words that came from the singer's mouth also originated in his brain. There have been many exceptions, some of them significant (disco comes to mind), but a strong sense of agency has continued to be important. Present-day pop singers who aren't writers (and most of the major ones have writer credits) still take pains to position their albums as personal statements. A rite of passage for a pop singer is the album that says, ""This is me-- this is what I'm all about."" Celine Dion is an outlier in this regard, but the list of singers of her ilk is not long. We've been conditioned to want some sort of direct line to the artist's point of view. With so much of Elvis' music, the sense that it reflected something about how he felt about the world wasn't there in quite the same way. This doesn't diminish his accomplishments, which are massive and undeniable, but it does mean that as new generations discover him, they'll be hearing him differently.</p>
<p>Over the years, Elvis' estate and RCA have taken a few different tacks to position him as a vital musical force and win him new fans. In the early 1990s, the hardcore devotees and serious music obsessives hit the jackpot, as RCA and BMG released three well-received box sets totaling 15 CDs, which together offered a searching overview of his entire career, dividing his output by decade. The sheer scope of that reissue project, and its ultimate success (two of the sets went platinum, the other gold), affirmed that Elvis was an artist worth exploring in minute detail, with musical treasures that extended well beyond his dozens of top 10 hits. But the last of these boxes came out almost 15 years ago. Since then, as the ranks of those who had their minds blown after seeing him on ""Ed Sullivan"" continues to thin, Elvis' place in music seems a little less assured. <i>ELV1S</i>, a collection of his #1 hits released in 2002, sold well, but it still had nowhere near the impact of the Beatles' <i>1</i>, upon which it was obviously modeled. It's tempting, in a year in which the Beatles catalog was remastered and Michael Jackson's music hit the charts after his untimely death, to stack Elvis up against these giants and see how he fares. Is he reaching new generations of fans? Are download-happy kids looking for ways to flesh out their Elvis mp3 collections?</p>
<p><i>Good Rockin' Tonight</i>, a 4xCD box set commemorating the 75th anniversary of Elvis' birth and covering his entire career-- from his first acetate in 1953 to the 2002 remix of ""A Little Less Conversation""-- could be seen as an attempt to answer the question of what he means today in a relatively succinct package (there are 100 songs here, but he recorded more than 700). There's little for the fans that own those decade sets-- the <i>50's Masters</i> box was complete, and the 60s and 70s collections hit just about every highlight-- but <i>Good Rockin' Tonight</i> offers a thorough and well-rounded look at a seminal artist for those who might know only a handful of hits. There are a few songs from his gospel records, which are usually cordoned off from his pop work on Elvis comps, as well as selections from his many film soundtracks (these were omitted from the 60s box) and some live cuts. The lot is sequenced in chronological order according to when it was cut, and you come away from this set with a good sense of how his music developed and changed over the 24 years of his recording life.</p>
<p>Ironically, because Elvis was not a songwriter and was so guarded about what he shared with the public, his music ends up having an odd sort of purity. All we have is surfaces-- the grain of his vocal, his phrasing, video and film images showing us how he moved (indeed, the easiest way into Elvis for newbies may well be YouTubes of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp3ywhOEDgc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performance footage from 1956</a> or the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKdSHr1i2Yo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">68 comeback special</a>, where his charisma, confidence, and physical beauty are as astonishing as ever). So in one sense, the story of this box set is the story of that virtuosic and unmistakable voice, how it grew and adapted and bent songs to fit Elvis' vision of what they should be.</p>
<p>""Jailhouse Rock"" has one of rock history's greatest snare sounds, but it's Elvis' half-screamed phrasing that makes it sound like a world-changing anthem. The assurance and richness of Elvis' tone on ""Love Me Tender"" is striking, but remembering when reading the set's well-done documentation that he was only 21 when he recorded it amplifies its depth. There's the drive and warmth of his tone on ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"", one of his more enduring second-tier hits, as Elvis seems to stick his neck out in the verses and then come back to a more assured place for the chorus. On ""Suspicious Minds"", he establishes a tone of anxiety and yearning and masterfully sustains it through the song's entire length without becoming tiring. And on into the 70s, when his hits were more likely to land only on the country charts, there's the big-hearted generosity of his version of the now-standard ""Always on My Mind"", showing how easily he could do simplicity when it was needed. For a singer whose vocal tics are so widely known that they became nuggets of pop culture history, the emotional range and variety of Elvis' singing here is extraordinary.</p>
<p>There are plenty of revelations here for those who know only the biggest singles. ""How Great Thou Art"" and ""Crying in the Chapel"", two cuts from Elvis' 1967 gospel album, <i>How Great Thou Art</i>, feature over-the-top arrangements, but Elvis brings a palpable vocal intensity to the material-- these were songs he is said to have felt very deeply, and that's the way they come across. ""Pocketful of Rainbows"", a tune from <i>G.I. Blues</i>, with its thick reverb and spacious arrangement, sounds oddly contemporary, a haunting but straightforward bit of mid-century pop. To use a recent touchstone, you can just about trace Richard Hawley's entire oeuvre to it. Like the gospel cuts and 1963's ""I Need Someone to Lean On"", an ultra lean ballad with a cocktail jazz tone, it shows a side to Elvis' singing that hasn't been overexposed, and it still sounds terrifically fresh.</p>
<p>Just as Elvis' voice pushed decent material into the realm of greatness, so it managed to wring something out of a duff song. ""Bossa Nova Baby"" is one of Leiber and Stoller's lyrically fuzzier and more dated creations, and it has the added handicap of not being not especially fun, but Elvis almost makes it worth hearing again. ""T-R-O-U-B-L-E"" from 1975 is a bland, unconvincing attempt to recapture the early rock'n'roll energy, and there are a couple of early ""That's All Right"" re-writes here that don't impress. But with the energy Elvis brought to his singing in the 50s, it didn't much matter. Even where the songs fail to connect as songs-- and for me there quite a few here-- Elvis' presence often redeems them.</p>
<p>For music fans who have trouble following along with Elvis' Vegas shtick as his career wore on, it's a cliché to say that the Sun Sessions, those recordings Elvis made in Memphis before he was nationally famous, are the best thing he ever did. And while I won't make that argument, considering how much he developed and expanded what he could do as he went on, the six tracks here from those sessions have lost nothing and still resonate, and I'm probably more likely to play ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"" than just about anything here. Elvis sounds like a teenager (which he was) who is just starting to realize the thrilling power of his gifts.</p>
<p>But oddly, the next track I'm likely to play is ""Unchained Melody"", the second to last cut on the set, recorded in 1977 during one of his final shows. As you can see from a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35Dpm5ZoCbE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stirring YouTube</a>, Elvis during this period is bloated, caked in horrifying makeup, and drugged, a shell of a man only months away from death. But somehow, sitting down at the piano, he manages to wring something out of this song that no one else had imagined. It's garish, operatic, and morbid, and I feel a little guilty for how much I love it; Elvis failed in so many ways, but this was his one untouchable thing, and I love hearing him do it in spite of it all, speaking to the world in the one language he thoroughly mastered. That the song to follow it and close out <i>Good Rockin' Tonight</i> is the bland and forgettable big beat remix of ""A Little Less Conversation"", commissioned for Nike's 2002 World Cup campaign, is a reminder of how easily that communication can become garbled.</p></div>"|13762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13762-elvis-75-good-rockin-tonight/|9.0|Mark Richardson

The oldest selection is the Black Dog's ""Virtual"", first released in 1989, which blends so perfectly with DJ Koze's 2009 ""Mrs. Bojangels"" that proto-IDM and 21st-century freak-house are revealed as kissing cousins. At 40-plus tracks, there's enough new-ish music from all the usual Euro suspects to keep fans of spacey and streamlined late-aughts dance music happy well into 2010. But it's the outré and half-forgotten stuff, the odd little hooks and nostalgia-triggering throwbacks, strewn among the austere beeps and pulses, that will keep you coming back. Like the quasi-noise/rock weirdness from Gang Gang Dance; Sebastien Tellier's laid-back flutes and strings, the kind of super-pungent Francophile kitsch that will leave you shaking your head with bemused laughter; and Gui Boratto's remix of Bomb the Bass, which features the best (and moodiest) riff of the set, the kind New Order should still be cranking out.</p>
<p><i>The Mix Session</i> is hardly the mini-masterpiece that was M.A.N.D.Y.'s 2005 <i>Body Language</i>, which was similarly broad-minded while sticking to mostly then-current material. Instead of going era-defining, M.A.N.D.Y's eschewed a seamless run-through of 2009's greatest hits in order to craft that ere-rare dance music object: the idiosyncratic commercial mix CD that's both ""deep"" and pop-friendly. It takes guts to include a killer record-- like, say, Felix Da Housecat's ""Silver Screen (Shower Scene)""-- that's old but not quite yet ""classic."" You risk being greeted with groans from the innovation-fixated cranks that comprise a large chunk of your audience. Maybe you think it's troubling that M.A.N.D.Y. have managed to stand out from the identikit minimal/deep pack simply by tossing in some moldy oldies-but-goodies, but I find their cross-genre/decade fearlessness refreshing. If nothing else we can all agree that it's surely the only mix we'll ever see to feature both Robag Wruhme <i>and</i> Mark Lanegan, Dominik Eulberg <i>and</i> P. Diddy.</p></div>"|13764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13764-renaissance-the-mix-collection/|7.0|Jess Harvell

Here are the other questions: What led drummer Jarle Vespestad to leave the band? Okay, well, that's a gossipy question-- his personal and professional reasons are his own. But does Supersilent <i>want </i>us to know he left the band? The liner notes, as always, refuse to list the personnel, and they do not mention that the quartet has become a trio. You might've noticed that the drums are missing, except that the remaining players have completely changed their instruments: For the session that produced this record, all three members played nothing but Hammond Organ. And that's not mentioned in the liner notes either.</p>
<p>But I go back to their proficiency on the instrument, because it's key to what makes this so special-- if not successful. While regular keyboardist Ståle Storløkken probably knows his way around the Hammond, I can't tell whether Arve Henriksen is as comfortable on the organ as he is on trumpet. Producer and electronic noisemaker Helge Sten is probably responsible for the album's extreme dynamic range, which is half the show: What they play is far less engrossing than how they amplify it, sometimes excruciatingly, with the rotation of the Leslie speakers raised to a gale force bellow. You're pulled so close to the guts of the organ that by the end you'll think you could build one yourself.</p>
<p>The first half of ""9.2"" simulates how it must sound to be eaten alive-- at least until the second half, when one player starts a loose vamp and the other two improvise against it.  But in the back half of the album, the storm ends and the players switch to a hush.  ""9.3"" is ambient and gentle, almost absent-mindedly turning upbeat at the end, and ""9.4"" grows so static that it's not even a dirge: It's lovely to listen to but bereft of tension.</p>
<p>Which is why I'm so curious about whether they're ""good"" on the Hammond. On past dates I took it for granted that each member of the band was an excellent musician, and yet musicianship is rarely what draws the ear to their music. Like early Pink Floyd, they engaged in an exploration that was unrehearsed and maybe even naïve. The band tried to sound like something <i>other </i>than the sum of its parts-- and by emerging from free and unrehearsed improvisation, the music resisted containers. By the time Supersilent recorded <i>8</i>, the members were inextricable from one another, the wails and ballads emerged organically, and their apparent goal-- of creating spontaneous, non-idiomatic, and exhilarating music-- was reached again and again.</p>
<p>But this time, it sounds like they're winging it in front of us-- thrilling themselves with new discoveries one minute, and the next, batting around ideas that go nowhere. Is the organ lineup here to stay? (Probably not: Storløkken has said they'll be back to their usual instruments when they tour next year.) Is the pervasive melancholy a stylistic choice, a side effect of working without percussion, or an emotional reaction to losing one-fourth of their musical organism? Will Supersilent survive, evolve, or die? Whatever the future holds, this is some of the riskiest improv the band has ever recorded: In every moment of the album, you can hear all three guys trying to figure out where to go next.</p></div>"|13756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13756-9/|5.7|Chris Dahlen

It's not the first evidence that the album's title is very much tongue in cheek. For Electrik Red, <i>class</i> is a nebulous quality, synonymous with an amorphous girl power cobbled together from the last decade of hip-hop and R&amp;B femme fatales (Beyoncé, Lil' Kim, Kelis, Ciara). Accordingly, Electrik Red see no contradiction between slave-driving dominance (""W.F.Y."") and slavish submission (""Bed Rest""), modern female independence (""Friend Lover"") and its easy loss (""So Good""), mercantile sexual consumerism (""P Is for Power"") and incommensurate sexual generosity (""Devotion"").</p>
<p>If that sounds like a criticism, it's not meant to be: Electrik Red understand that we don't know what we want even when we sound like we do; if they seem to conflate love and sex a little too freely, well, life's like that when the going's good. It's not a concept album, but if <i>How to Be a Lady</i> has a central concept, it's that of the <i>fling</i>, the romantic rendezvous that starts off as something fun and ends up much more intense and involved. And the music feels like a fling, too, its easy comforts concealing more mysterious, urgent impulses. Mostly written and produced by R&amp;B singer The-Dream and his in-house production team (C. ""Tricky"" Stewart, L.O.S. Da Mystro), the album features that same penchant for intoxicatingly lush, swirly slow jams and rococo, information-overload uptempo tracks that characterize The-Dream's own work, not to mention lyrics that alternate between perfect, ridiculous, and perfectly ridiculous (""Tonight's the night, so baby order/ Now I'm biting on your body like an hors doeurve"").</p>
<p>Undeniably, Electrik Red are contemporary R&amp;B formula: four harmonizing and occasionally rapping vocalists covering the spectrum from breathy innocence to sly rasp; overripe synthetic productions drunk on 1980s Prince, R Kelly, and Polow Da Don; a near total obliviousness to matters outside of sex and dancing and their attendant concerns. Their confidence is the confidence of an entire genre, detached from the hallmarks of individualism that traditionally attract plaudits, such that it doesn't really matter whether it's Lesley or Naomi who takes time out from ""W.F.Y."" to compliment you on that thing that you do with your tongue (""Amazing. Stupendous. Marvelous. <i>Exciting.</i>"") but then criticize you for wearing skinny jeans.</p>
<p><i>How to Be a Lady </i>is filled with gratuitous little surprises: the absurd and brilliant cod-operatic backing vocals in the rococo chorus of ""Freaky Freaky""; the commanding dance instructions (""Cup, sip, yep... yurrr/ Two step, stop... yurrr"") that interrupt the icy club banger ""Drink in My Cup""; the sudden shard of inadvertent melancholy that invades the breezy ""Friend Lover"" as Naomi tells her friend with benefits, ""You can't stay past five/ I gotta be at work by nine!"" Such moments make Electrik Red's music feel as real and lived-in as dazzling, shiny R&amp;B can hope to, possessing a capacity for <i>rightness </i>that cannot be reduced to lyrical sophistication, performative flair, or production novelty, but is borne of the kind of charisma you can possess when you take success for granted. And because Electrik Red take it for granted, it's tempting to adopt the same stance as listener; but these songs have already outsmarted you. As ""So Good"" puts it, ""I shouldn't have let you hit that/ 'Cause now I can't forget that.""</p></div>"|13606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13606-how-to-be-a-lady-volume-1/|8.2|Tim Finney

In the 1970s, Michael Abramson chose the latter path when he brought his camera to Pepper's Hideout on Chicago's South Side. Following in the footsteps of his acknowledged influence  Gyula Halász, a Hungarian photographer better known as Brassaï who became the pre-eminent chronicler of the Paris nightlife he loved so much, Abramson insinuated himself into the nightlife of Chicago's predominantly black neighborhoods. He was very much a part of the scene he documented on film, drinking, laughing, and dancing with his subjects into small hours and becoming as much a part of the atmosphere as the locals who frequented the same nightspots he did.</p>
<p>Numero Group has done a fair amount of work to preserve and document the South Chicago music scene of the 60s and 70s, releasing Eccentric Soul volumes on the Twinight and Bandit labels, reissuing Boscoe's phenomenal self-titled LP, and now giving us this set, which pairs a huge book of Abramson's striking photographs from Pepper's Hideout and its more risque counterpart, Perv's House, with a disc of music that mirrors the photos' sexuality and good humor. Abramson contributes a very short explanatory essay, but his black-and-whites are presented on their own, without captions, which is the best way to present them in this context. The intent of the project isn't journalistic after all. The whole package is built to include you in a party you likely never got to go to.</p>
<p>In addition to Abramson's photos, there are scanned flyers for blues and soul shows, the front and back of Abramson's own Player's Playground Card-- which granted him admission to Perv's House-- and an assortment of business cards from the old regulars. The picture here is of a lively, vibrant scene where people came to have fun and forget about daily problems. They clown, preen, and pose for the camera at times, but for the most part they just do their thing while Abramson snaps away, capturing them in half-lidded, off-balance, smiling, yawning, ecstatic, and joyful moments. In a Facebook era, this might not seem unusual, but it's not often you see a cameraphone grab that preserves a moment with such honest artistry as the images included here. There's a reason Abramson's work is owned by museums.</p>
<p>The accompanying disc of music is aptly subtitled <i>Pepper's Jukebox</i>, and though it lacks the archival and informational thoroughness that's become Numero's hallmark, it does provide a perfect soundtrack for the images. These are the songs they danced and laughed to, and the emphasis is one gritty, funky blues tunes. There's plenty of wailing harmonica and scratchy guitar, a hefty dose of double entendre and lots of plain great songs. Bobby Rush's classic ""Bowlegged Women, Knock-Kneed Man"" is a roaring and not really veiled tribute to the joys of doing it, and it's just the tip of the iceberg. Arelean Brown's ""I Am a Streaker"" works in similar territory, and she's not afraid to talk up her attributes: I'm built like an outhouse/ With not a brick out of place.../ Chest like headlights on a pimp's car...""</p>
<p>There are cool oddities, like the instrumental version of Syl Johnson's epochal soul cut ""Is It Because I'm Black"", and a bit of social commentary on Lucille Spann's gravel-voiced ""Women's Lib"", but the best songs get right to the heart of the blues. Willie Davis' ""I Learned My Lesson"" is flat-out powerful, with deep, dark verses and a ragged, finger-blistering guitar solo; it's a masterclass of smoky Chicago blues. On ""You Made Me Suffer"", Andrew Brown brings his blues noir into the funky 70s, mixing his lead guitar with heavy soul vocals and a popping drumbeat.</p>
<p>Taken together, the photo book and the disc offer a taste of what it might have been like inside Pepper's Hideout on a good night, and it seems like most nights at Pepper's were good nights. That scene is long gone today, so the opportunity to get an outsider's peek in is appreciated. It's also a rarity in the mp3 era to make such a complete experience out of music and packaging, and the package here is outstanding. Come for the sights, stay for the sounds. And don't be afraid to have a good time.</p></div>"|13736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13736-light-on-the-south-side/|8.3|Joe Tangari

It's probably not a greater number than the fanbase that band built between their first single (1993's ""Prescription Sunglasses"") and their last (2001's post-breakup ""4Dix""), or the number of people that've gotten into the Hold Steady since 2004 and subsequently got the notion to check out what the deal was with Craig Finn's old group. But somewhere between the release of their final album, <i>Fiestas + Fiascos</i>, and the three-night final-reunion set that inaugurated the music room of Minneapolis' Triple Rock Social Club roughly six years ago, Lifter Puller's following grew to the point where they wound up becoming a feverishly adored cult band-- not quite famous, but infamous to just about everyone who'd heard of them. Fans took road trips to the Twin Cities just to visit intersections name-dropped in songs, Finn's lyrical mythologies were built and deconstructed on messageboards and fansites, and at least one person went and got himself a set of ""LFTR PLLR"" knuckle tattoos. This band bred fanatics.</p>
<p>And it'll keep doing so-- this <i>en masse</i> reissue of the entire Lifter Puller discography should see to that. A decade past their heyday, there's still something that resonates unsettlingly in their songs, something even more seedy and desperate than the party-casualty scenarios that fueled the Hold Steady's breakthrough. With his first band, Finn's lyrical tics and themes were well in place already-- shady nightlife characters that introduce themselves with preposterous nicknames, unexpected collisions of different music-scene casualties, people fucking in bizarre locales and somehow waking up in even stranger ones. But it's all just a bit more threatening and sordid, the humor bleaker, the redemption more elusive. It could be that Lifter Puller's style puts an additional edge to things; trade in the Hold Steady's bar-band classic rock for a beat-up indie rock/newish wave that staggers between sludgy and jittery, and it'd be hard not to make the allusion-filled literary/pop-cult debris of Finn's burnout milieu feel just a bit more unhinged.</p>
<p>And it didn't take too long to get there, either. Both their self-titled debut and <i>Half Dead and Dynamite </i>were released in 1997, and the leap between the two is startling. The first album's a sort of textbook indie rock feeling-out process, an effort that results in a surprising progenitor of the band as we know them: ""Star Wars Hips"", a song which introduces the nightclub fire that would become the dramatic turning point of <i>Fiestas + Fiascos </i>and Juanita, the recurring figure of the Lifter Pullerverse who might have been responsible for lighting it. Most of <i>Lifter Puller</i> is sort of an uncharacteristic slog, though-- Finn's lyrics show early signs of his off-kilter, unpredictable internal rhyme schemes (from ""Mission Viejo"": ""haven't been as high as this since the night I burned my lips"") but aren't quite as dense with referential humor and feel more like narrative sketches than vivid character portraits. And despite a few scattered songs like the Pavement-with-a-switchblade slink of ""Double Straps"" and the vertiginous half-Wire of ""The Mezzanine Gyp"" (in which it sounds like Finn is muttering through a Burger King intercom), the energy level tends to wane, especially during the hazy, vague breakup postmortem of the seven-plus-minute ""Lazy Eye"". Even then, Finn scores a hell of a lyric: ""Let this be a testament/ To every lightbulb filament/ That burned itself out before it got turned on.""</p>
<p><i>Lifter Puller</i> is best heard as a warmup for <i>Half Dead and Dynamite</i>, which is where the band started playing to their strengths (and adding a couple of new ones). Dan Monick's drumming provided a backbeat that sounded like it could trip and fall into the gutter at any moment but never really did, and doubled up with Tommy Roach's gelatinous basslines it was tight enough to make the hard rock strut of ""To Live and Die in LBI"" and ""The Gin and the Sour Defeat"" that much punchier. This was also the point when guitarist Steve Barone turned into guitarist/<i>keyboardist</i> Steve Barone, and his tendency to forgo solos for a restless array of post-punk/hard rock guitar riffs was augmented by a weirdly amateurish cheap-Casio minimalism that bled car-alarm panic all over ""I Like the Lights"" and turned the title track into some kind of John Carpenter nightmare; of course, it fit perfectly.</p>
<p>And while Craig Finn sounded like Craig Finn from the start, this is where he really took off, spiraling deeper down into the subject matter of drugged-out, alcohol-soaked escapism and bad decisions, but tempering them with smart-assed punchlines (""She said she's waiting on the steady type/ Then she disappears with the eye-patch guy"") and enigmatic yet evocative characterization that comes close to justifying the haze of hangovers and unfamiliar beds the songs' subjects stumble through. Then again, they hadn't just figured out how to pull this balance off for the first time, they simply proved they could do it more consistently and from every angle; the slow-building bitterness and violence that punctuates ""Nassau Coliseum"" dates back a couple of years in its origins as a B-side, but it stands out as <i>Half Dead</i>'s dramatic high point.</p>
<p>1998's <i>The Entertainment and Arts </i>EP feels like a brief but boisterous kick in the ass-- a quick-and-dirty intro (""Plymouth Rock""), three bewildered pill-addled hookup chronicles (""The Candy Machine and My Girlfriend"", ""Sangre de Stephanie"", ""Roaming the Foam"") and a slower yet more intense rerecording of ""Star Wars Hips"", all building up to the seething, feverish ""Let's Get Incredible"", as good a candidate for a Lifter Puller mission statement as any (""These kids want something new to get their eyes rolling back into their dreams/ They want a cellophane celebration/ A revolution rushing into dancefloor distribution"").</p>
<p>But it's <i>Fiestas + Fiascos</i>, their rock-opera grand finale and the only Lifter Puller full-length to feature future Hold Steady guitarist Tad Kubler on bass, that the band should and will be defined by. Whether the cast of characters that had shown up in previous songs here and there had some grand design planned for them, or whether the album<i> </i>was simply a collection of callbacks fashioned into a loose narrative, <i>F+F </i>was a delirious blur of bloody fights and criminal activity and illicit sex rendered in ash-covered countertops and ripped upholstery. Everything comes in quick bursts, three and a half minutes at most, darting from song to song and event to event like a police blotter: a tweaky Springsteen lift turned into a tale of two drugged-up lovers screwing in a bathroom stall (""Candy's Room""), a jumpy little number about anonymous gay hookups and people ""making money with their mouths"" (""Manpark""), a sinister-sounding profile of the cracked-out, club-owning schemer Nightclub Dwight (""Nice Nice"") and the declaration by a criminal loan shark, namely <i>Half Dead and Dynamite</i>'s Eye-patch Guy, that both Dwight and his nightclub are marked for destruction (""The Flex and the Buff Result""). Because Lifter Puller are all about the feeling of now-fucking-what panic, that's where the album ends, smothered in a muffled yet blown-out squall that sounds like the music itself is going up in flames, a story that ends with a gut-turning uncertainty.</p>
<p>The story of Lifter Puller themselves almost ended that way, too, with tales of live shows getting passed around like rumors and those crucial albums lapsing out of print by the time the first Hold Steady album saw the light. 2002's <i>Soft Rock </i>compilation was a valiant effort at tying the mythos together before it could get any further unraveled, but these reissues easily top it by dint of including practically everything the band ever released. That includes the singles and B-sides accumulated on <i>Slips Backwards</i>-- not the most cohesive picture of Lifter Puller at their best, but nearly every song's characteristically <i>theirs</i>, and the two best tracks-- ""Math is Money"" and ""Secret Santa Cruz""-- sound so in tune with the vibe of <i>Fiestas + Fiascos </i>that it's hard to believe they didn't make the cut.</p>
<p>Each reissued album also includes a few recordings, mostly bootleg-quality, of live shows that were roughly contemporaneous with the albums they originally toured behind. They're nice little bonus curios for the most part, though none of them have the electricity in the air that filled the room during the 2003 Triple Rock shows, six songs of which are included with <i>Fiestas + Fiascos</i>. Three years after Lifter Puller broke up, there they are performing to a crowd that's ecstatic at the possibility of finally getting to see this myth in person one last time, a crowd that can't help but sing along at every opportunity. Surviving the nightlife is tricky enough, but Lifter Puller survived potential obscurity, too -- and they've earned every fanatic.</p></div>"|13744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13744-lifter-puller-half-dead-and-dynamite-the-entertainment-and-arts-ep-fiestas-and-fiascos-slips-backwards/|6.5|Nate Patrin

Then again, they hadn't just figured out how to pull this balance off for the first time, they simply proved they could do it more consistently and from every angle; the slow-building bitterness and violence that punctuates ""Nassau Coliseum"" dates back a couple of years in its origins as a B-side, but it stands out as <i>Half Dead</i>'s dramatic high point.</p>
<p>1998's <i>The Entertainment and Arts </i>EP feels like a brief but boisterous kick in the ass-- a quick-and-dirty intro (""Plymouth Rock""), three bewildered pill-addled hookup chronicles (""The Candy Machine and My Girlfriend"", ""Sangre de Stephanie"", ""Roaming the Foam"") and a slower yet more intense rerecording of ""Star Wars Hips"", all building up to the seething, feverish ""Let's Get Incredible"", as good a candidate for a Lifter Puller mission statement as any (""These kids want something new to get their eyes rolling back into their dreams/ They want a cellophane celebration/ A revolution rushing into dancefloor distribution"").</p>
<p>But it's <i>Fiestas + Fiascos</i>, their rock-opera grand finale and the only Lifter Puller full-length to feature future Hold Steady guitarist Tad Kubler on bass, that the band should and will be defined by. Whether the cast of characters that had shown up in previous songs here and there had some grand design planned for them, or whether the album<i> </i>was simply a collection of callbacks fashioned into a loose narrative, <i>F+F </i>was a delirious blur of bloody fights and criminal activity and illicit sex rendered in ash-covered countertops and ripped upholstery. Everything comes in quick bursts, three and a half minutes at most, darting from song to song and event to event like a police blotter: a tweaky Springsteen lift turned into a tale of two drugged-up lovers screwing in a bathroom stall (""Candy's Room""), a jumpy little number about anonymous gay hookups and people ""making money with their mouths"" (""Manpark""), a sinister-sounding profile of the cracked-out, club-owning schemer Nightclub Dwight (""Nice Nice"") and the declaration by a criminal loan shark, namely <i>Half Dead and Dynamite</i>'s Eye-patch Guy, that both Dwight and his nightclub are marked for destruction (""The Flex and the Buff Result""). Because Lifter Puller are all about the feeling of now-fucking-what panic, that's where the album ends, smothered in a muffled yet blown-out squall that sounds like the music itself is going up in flames, a story that ends with a gut-turning uncertainty.</p>
<p>The story of Lifter Puller themselves almost ended that way, too, with tales of live shows getting passed around like rumors and those crucial albums lapsing out of print by the time the first Hold Steady album saw the light. 2002's <i>Soft Rock </i>compilation was a valiant effort at tying the mythos together before it could get any further unraveled, but these reissues easily top it by dint of including practically everything the band ever released. That includes the singles and B-sides accumulated on <i>Slips Backwards</i>-- not the most cohesive picture of Lifter Puller at their best, but nearly every song's characteristically <i>theirs</i>, and the two best tracks-- ""Math is Money"" and ""Secret Santa Cruz""-- sound so in tune with the vibe of <i>Fiestas + Fiascos </i>that it's hard to believe they didn't make the cut.</p>
<p>Each reissued album also includes a few recordings, mostly bootleg-quality, of live shows that were roughly contemporaneous with the albums they originally toured behind. They're nice little bonus curios for the most part, though none of them have the electricity in the air that filled the room during the 2003 Triple Rock shows, six songs of which are included with <i>Fiestas + Fiascos</i>. Three years after Lifter Puller broke up, there they are performing to a crowd that's ecstatic at the possibility of finally getting to see this myth in person one last time, a crowd that can't help but sing along at every opportunity. Surviving the nightlife is tricky enough, but Lifter Puller survived potential obscurity, too -- and they've earned every fanatic.</p></div>"|13744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13744-lifter-puller-half-dead-and-dynamite-the-entertainment-and-arts-ep-fiestas-and-fiascos-slips-backwards/|8.2|Nate Patrin

It's probably not a greater number than the fanbase that band built between their first single (1993's ""Prescription Sunglasses"") and their last (2001's post-breakup ""4Dix""), or the number of people that've gotten into the Hold Steady since 2004 and subsequently got the notion to check out what the deal was with Craig Finn's old group. But somewhere between the release of their final album, <i>Fiestas + Fiascos</i>, and the three-night final-reunion set that inaugurated the music room of Minneapolis' Triple Rock Social Club roughly six years ago, Lifter Puller's following grew to the point where they wound up becoming a feverishly adored cult band-- not quite famous, but infamous to just about everyone who'd heard of them. Fans took road trips to the Twin Cities just to visit intersections name-dropped in songs, Finn's lyrical mythologies were built and deconstructed on messageboards and fansites, and at least one person went and got himself a set of ""LFTR PLLR"" knuckle tattoos. This band bred fanatics.</p>
<p>And it'll keep doing so-- this <i>en masse</i> reissue of the entire Lifter Puller discography should see to that. A decade past their heyday, there's still something that resonates unsettlingly in their songs, something even more seedy and desperate than the party-casualty scenarios that fueled the Hold Steady's breakthrough. With his first band, Finn's lyrical tics and themes were well in place already-- shady nightlife characters that introduce themselves with preposterous nicknames, unexpected collisions of different music-scene casualties, people fucking in bizarre locales and somehow waking up in even stranger ones. But it's all just a bit more threatening and sordid, the humor bleaker, the redemption more elusive. It could be that Lifter Puller's style puts an additional edge to things; trade in the Hold Steady's bar-band classic rock for a beat-up indie rock/newish wave that staggers between sludgy and jittery, and it'd be hard not to make the allusion-filled literary/pop-cult debris of Finn's burnout milieu feel just a bit more unhinged.</p>
<p>And it didn't take too long to get there, either. Both their self-titled debut and <i>Half Dead and Dynamite </i>were released in 1997, and the leap between the two is startling. The first album's a sort of textbook indie rock feeling-out process, an effort that results in a surprising progenitor of the band as we know them: ""Star Wars Hips"", a song which introduces the nightclub fire that would become the dramatic turning point of <i>Fiestas + Fiascos </i>and Juanita, the recurring figure of the Lifter Pullerverse who might have been responsible for lighting it. Most of <i>Lifter Puller</i> is sort of an uncharacteristic slog, though-- Finn's lyrics show early signs of his off-kilter, unpredictable internal rhyme schemes (from ""Mission Viejo"": ""haven't been as high as this since the night I burned my lips"") but aren't quite as dense with referential humor and feel more like narrative sketches than vivid character portraits. And despite a few scattered songs like the Pavement-with-a-switchblade slink of ""Double Straps"" and the vertiginous half-Wire of ""The Mezzanine Gyp"" (in which it sounds like Finn is muttering through a Burger King intercom), the energy level tends to wane, especially during the hazy, vague breakup postmortem of the seven-plus-minute ""Lazy Eye"". Even then, Finn scores a hell of a lyric: ""Let this be a testament/ To every lightbulb filament/ That burned itself out before it got turned on.""</p>
<p><i>Lifter Puller</i> is best heard as a warmup for <i>Half Dead and Dynamite</i>, which is where the band started playing to their strengths (and adding a couple of new ones). Dan Monick's drumming provided a backbeat that sounded like it could trip and fall into the gutter at any moment but never really did, and doubled up with Tommy Roach's gelatinous basslines it was tight enough to make the hard rock strut of ""To Live and Die in LBI"" and ""The Gin and the Sour Defeat"" that much punchier. This was also the point when guitarist Steve Barone turned into guitarist/<i>keyboardist</i> Steve Barone, and his tendency to forgo solos for a restless array of post-punk/hard rock guitar riffs was augmented by a weirdly amateurish cheap-Casio minimalism that bled car-alarm panic all over ""I Like the Lights"" and turned the title track into some kind of John Carpenter nightmare; of course, it fit perfectly.</p>

That includes the singles and B-sides accumulated on <i>Slips Backwards</i>-- not the most cohesive picture of Lifter Puller at their best, but nearly every song's characteristically <i>theirs</i>, and the two best tracks-- ""Math is Money"" and ""Secret Santa Cruz""-- sound so in tune with the vibe of <i>Fiestas + Fiascos </i>that it's hard to believe they didn't make the cut.</p>
<p>Each reissued album also includes a few recordings, mostly bootleg-quality, of live shows that were roughly contemporaneous with the albums they originally toured behind. They're nice little bonus curios for the most part, though none of them have the electricity in the air that filled the room during the 2003 Triple Rock shows, six songs of which are included with <i>Fiestas + Fiascos</i>. Three years after Lifter Puller broke up, there they are performing to a crowd that's ecstatic at the possibility of finally getting to see this myth in person one last time, a crowd that can't help but sing along at every opportunity. Surviving the nightlife is tricky enough, but Lifter Puller survived potential obscurity, too -- and they've earned every fanatic.</p></div>"|13744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13744-lifter-puller-half-dead-and-dynamite-the-entertainment-and-arts-ep-fiestas-and-fiascos-slips-backwards/|7.8|Nate Patrin

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>If Elbow did seem too mature for a new band, you can chalk it up to <i>Asleep in the Back </i>gestating for almost a decade.<span> </span>As such, it can be described in a lot of unsexy ways-- patient, stately, considered, professional. <span> </span>There's only one song that really qualifies as ""rock"" (though the menacing ""Bitten By the Tailfly"" is defined by its tension as much as its volume), half of the tracks top out at over five minutes, moving with cruise-ship luxury and tempo, and there aren't really hooks so much as ""moments"" where the restraint and attention to sonic detail build into an undeniable payoff.<span> </span>Now, talking about production is usually viewed as a backhanded compliment-- we should be talking about the <i>songs, man</i>... right?<span> </span>But as languorous as the tempos can be, <i>Asleep in the Back </i>is studious and hardworking, proof that modern albums can still sound luxurious.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Despite minimal soloing and nothing in the way of tricksy time signatures, it strangely got tagged as ""prog.""<span> </span>It sort of is in the way Built to Spill's <i>Perfect From Now On </i>was ""prog""-- constantly shifting textures and always sounding like it's headed somewhere.<span> </span>The dank bass and processed, dub-influenced drum sound that begins ""Any Day Now"" come off like a hungover transmission from Massive Attack's <i>Mezzanine</i> until the band opens the shades and lets the sun inside (to cop a quote from <i>Cast of Thousands</i>' ""Ribcage"").<span> </span>Two bright and major-key chords repeat throughout the track's six minutes with unease, breaking down for an <i>a cappella</i> mission statement: ""How's about getting out of this place... got a lot of spare time, some of my youth and all my senses on overdrive.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Most tracks are buffeted with horns and strings, but in retrospect it's all the more impressive how they're culled for shading than the kind of levels-in-the-red overkill that often resulted in post-Arcade Fire orchestration.<span> </span>So much about the gorgeous title track sneaks up you-- a whistling organ drone breezes easily through the mix, woodwinds seep into the guitar waltz like ink into water, and when the trumpets herald its hopeful finale, it feels earned.<span> </span>The violin shredding at the end of ""Red"" combines with the controlled chaos of Jupp's cymbal hits to mirror its subject's descent into substance addiction.<span> </span>""Saxophone coda"" is the sort of thing that gets brought up when savaging an overblown cod-epic, but such a device is all the more effective on ""Powder Blue"" for how it contrasts with the powerless of its narrator (""I'm proud to be the one you hold when the shakes begin"").<span> </span><span> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Which is not to suggest Elbow are merely a studio band.<span> </span>A couple of Steve Lamacq radio sessions and an early EP are included in the Deluxe packaging, and the band sounds great in a stripped down setting, particularly singer Guy Garvey.<span> </span>The Peter Gabriel comparisons were certainly fair, as the strongest melodic moments of <i>Asleep </i>tend to find Garvey in that register.<span> </span>But for the most part, Garvey turned out to have more in common with barstool-bound indie bards of America-- wryly romantic like the National's Matt Berninger without the class-consciousness, drunk like the Walkmen's Hamilton Leithauser but not as unhinged.<span> </span>Although the guitar hook of ""Bitten By the Tailfly"" rivals the earwax-blast of ""The Rat"", it's in large part due to how quiet its surroundings are-- it's a rare treat to hear a major-label album where the soft parts are quiet and the loud parts are <i>loud</i>.<span> </span>The dynamic volume of <i>Asleep in the Back </i>set the standard for what would turn out to be one of the most consistently well-produced bands out there.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And then there's ""Newborn"", the centerpiece of <i>Asleep</i>. If you've heard only the radio version, you've literally got only half the story.<span> </span>Though clocking in at a mighty seven minutes, the first three were used as a compact single, while the the triplet guitar figure that bridges the verse and chorus become the intro for the stunning second half, a constantly building that sits somewhere between Catherine Wheel's most heroic moments and the strange, pastoral spirituality of latter-day Talk Talk (it's possible the abrupt ending is a direct nod to ""Ascension Day"").<span> </span>It's such a stunning, career-defining performance that the second half of <i>Asleep in the Back </i>can't help but take something of breather: The downtempo ""Don't Mix Your Drinks"" establishes the languid mood that isn't lifted until the lovely, fingerpicked nostalgia of ""Scattered Black and Whites"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I guess we're dancing around the obvious question of who knows why <i>Asleep in the Back </i>is getting the bonus treatment right in between rounder anniversaries-- about eight years old, and can be easily obtained in its original edition.<span> </span>Maybe it's contractual, maybe it's just a Hail Mary attempt to give critics a quick reminder while putting together Best of 00s lists (<i>NME</i> has it at #30), or maybe, as Jason Crock pointed out in his review of the recent Jesus Lizard reissues, it wouldn't be a surprise if it merely was done to cut through a poky December release slate to remind listeners of its existence.<span> </span>Either way is satisfactory as long as Elbow have a chance to be heard anew instead of taken for granted: <i>Asleep in the Back </i>shows one of this decade's most underrated bands in its finest hour.</p>

That's what Mulatu Astatke called his style of music when he invented it back in the 1960s, and it means exactly what it implies: Ethiopian melodies played on Western instruments with room for improvisation. Astatke was a pioneer for his country's modern music. His concept of instrumental music as an end in itself was a bit foreign in his homeland, where singers rule the popular music sphere, and he was among the very first musicians from Ethiopia to learn about music while abroad. He started playing as a teenager at school in Wales, and after a stint at London's Trinity School of Music, he jumped the Atlantic for a brief stay at Boston's Berklee College of Music, ultimately winding up in New York City in the mid-60s. There, he was exposed to sounds he simply couldn't have heard back home in Addis Ababa, and his exposure to jazz and Western harmonic concepts led him to formulate Ethio jazz, the perfect hybrid of the traditional and the modern.</p>
<p>His first attempts to forge his new genre occurred in the U.S., and his band members were mostly Puerto Rican. You can tell by listening, too. The several tracks here lifted from his two <i>Afro Latin Soul</i> LPs bear a strong stamp of boogaloo, Latin jazz, and other Americo-Caribbean forms. When he returned to Ethiopia, he arrived at a time when the country was opening up as never before, and Addis Ababa was as cosmopolitan as cities came, boiling with cultural restlessness that fed a vibrant nightlife. Recording resources were limited, but in 1969, Mulatu began cutting tracks for Amha Eshèté's Amha, the first independent label ever established in the country. He worked primarily as an arranger, but frequently wrote and recorded instrumentals to serve as B-sides for vocal songs, some of which are being issued here for the first time outside Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Astatke brought a unique skill set back to Addis with him, where he was able to employ musicians who'd grown up with the music he was so consciously modernizing. The resulting music is simply brilliant, fresh even decades later. The way Mulatu harmonized horns, combining pentatonic Ethiopian melody with Western chord concepts, sounds like no one else-- the music seems both ancient and modern at once, befitting the mixture of raw ingredients. This compilation is utterly intoxicating from the first note to the last-- preternaturally funky, haunting, complex, memorable, exciting, and unique, Ethio jazz easily transcends the era in which it was made.</p>
<p>""Mulatu"", from his 1972 LP <i>Mulatu of Ethiopia</i>, recorded in New York with members of Mongo Santamaria's band during a visit to the States, is a brilliant signature track, a darkly funky tune with a hint of Caribbean shuffle, snaking sax solos, Mulatu's own cloudy vibraphone, and a bit of wah-pedaled Wurlitzer. The stately, smoky ""Netsanet"" is drawn from 1974's <i>Yekatit: Ethio Jazz</i> LP, the very first Ethiopian LP to be conceived as an album in advance (as opposed to a collection of 45 sides). Like the other songs from that album, it has a weighty solemnity to it that betrays the difficult revolutionary period during which it was recorded. My favorite Mulatu track, ""Ené Alantchie Alnorem"", was previously featured on Buda Musique's<i> Ethiopiques Volume 4</i> compilation, and it still kills here. It is a song without a solid core: its fluttering electric piano, flute, and drums spin in an ethereal wash, held together by wind sound effects and a heavy sonority, and the descending piano line that outlines the chords feels like it's falling and catching itself on each beat.</p>
<p>A handful of vocal tracks dot the compilation, and they're all outstanding as well. ""Ebo Lala"" features Seifu Yohannes putting on his best Bollywood-inspired show, huffing and puffing over a heavy Latin beat and blasting horn section. ""Wubit"", featuring Muluken Melesse, has a cool, funky crime jazz strut, a sick breakdown, and a quintessentially Ethiopian melismatic vocal-- that this song has remained hidden from all but a few collectors in Ethiopia until now is almost criminal. Even Mulatu's very first foray into recording, the Latin-tinged instrumental ""Shagu"", bears his unmistakable signature, playing its cycling piano riff two octaves lower than in most Latin music and featuring a dark, mysterious vibraphone lead playing between Ethiopian pentatonics and modal concepts nicked from post-bop jazz.</p>
<p>Ethio jazz was never a commercial success in Ethiopia. That Ahma and Philips Ethiopia even saw fit to release any of it is a credit to their commitment to art over commerce, and even today it remains little-heard in its homeland. But Mulatu was a master craftsman and one of the most supremely inventive composers of a time when an awful lot of creative music was being made around the world. He's still going today, guesting on radio shows and teaching in Addis, and he released a great album with London's the Heliocentrics as his backing band earlier this year. But even if he'd disappeared after 1975, his legacy would be sealed.</p></div>"|13678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13678-new-york-addis-london-the-story-of-ethio-jazz-1965-1975/|9.0|Joe Tangari

The best producers and beat collectives could do this seemingly at will, get listeners simultaneously considering the inner musical workings of both the Bomb Squad and James Brown, RZA and Willie Mitchell, Basement Jaxx and Gary Numan. Like his older brother Madlib, Oh No seems as fascinated with the notion of picking a specific palette to work from as he is with advancing his own style, having previously done so with albums based on thematic source material like stage-and-screen composer Galt MacDermot (<i>Exodus into Unheard Rhythms</i>) and Middle Eastern/Mediterranean psychedelic rock (<i>Dr. No's Oxperiment</i>). But if Oh No's style isn't drastically different than that of his famously out-there brother, it's still a recognizably consistent and characteristic one, no matter what he feeds into his sampler.</p>
<p><i>Dr. No's Ethiopium </i>is the next in his string of dedicated-source concept records, and it's the kind of thing you'd think would have been done a long time ago. Drawing off Ethiopian music of the 1960s and 70s, especially since the <i>Ethiopiques </i>series rose to prominence, would fit the more adventurous styles of hip-hop production to a T, and the region's recognizable but culturally unique permutations of American jazz, funk, and folk music traditions (and the precursors thereof) would make for some accessibly exotic beats. That it was Oh No who came around to it is fortunate; the man has professed to be the kind of producer who's always willing to find a way to make beats out of anything, and his track record's revealed that M.O. to work out well for him. (He did have two of the best beats on <i>The Ecstatic</i>, in any case.)</p>
<p><i>Ethiopium--</i> a top-notch genre name if there ever was one-- rests on the ability of Oh No's alchemy to preserve just enough of the original sound to make its origins recognizable, but still finds a way to whittle it down to shards and fit it to his own, differently-angled approach. The songs themselves are shreds of music in themselves, 36 tracks at two minutes or less, in the now-familiar structure of typical Stones Throw beat-tape concoctions. They're odd little see-sawing loops and stagger-step blasts assembled from thickly-stitched scraps of brass sections and chiming guitars and wailing vocals, all truncated into little bursts of disembodied, attention-grabbing remnants. Sometimes the rhythms feel built around the loops, like the sharply plucked notes (possibly from a lyre-style <i>krar</i>) that choppily bob along with ""Madness""' bounce. Other times, he lets the original rhythms play out for a bit like he does at the beginning of ""Problematic"", only to yank the rug out from under it and mold it into a new, more boom-bap-friendly cadence. And there are tracks where he just uses these loops and snippets like almost diversionary flourishes, garnishing tracks like ""Drive By"" and ""Midnight Missions"" with scattered Ethiopian ambiance.</p>
<p>Not every sound on this album comes from Oh No's cratedigging trips through the East African reaches of Egon's record collection. There's lots of modern digital boom-clap beats, and I suspect that many of the drum breaks come as much from the go-to hip hop repertoire of vintage American funk and jazz loops as they do from a potential Addis Ababa equivalent to Clyde Stubblefield. Which is part of the appeal, really; some of the brightest moments come from the tracks where crackly shreds of Ethiopian source material push exclamatory notes through a wall of post-Dilla bass-glow rhythm (""Louder""; ""Strong""). And while <i>Ethiopium </i>has a few moments where Oh No teeters on the edge of irreverence-- some goofy non sequitur, expletive-filled movie soundbites, a few blasts of brass or vocals that seem picked as much for their foreign strangeness as their beauty-- it also lets the loop-Benihana structure recede every so often to just let the original texture of the sources shine through, like it does on the gorgeous ""The Pain"". Oh No knows just what he's got to work with on this album, and in finding every angle he can for an incredible array of source material, he's made that much more of a case for his own style, too.</p></div>"|13745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13745-dr-nos-ethiopium/|7.7|Nate Patrin

When Philly mainstays Julian Grefe and Justin Geller, core duo behind disco freaks Pink Skull, put together the first <i>Rvng Prsnts</i> mix back in 2002, they recorded it straight to CD-R and did the printing at Kinko's. Each copy of <i>Endless Bummer</i>, Pink Skull's second album (first for RVNG), comes hand-typeset with a different ""bummer""-- real depressing shit like ""BUTT ACNE"" or ""NUCLEAR WARFARE."" I got ""JOHNHUGHESDIED.""</p>
<p>In a year of summery new-music releases and celebrity deaths, <i>Endless Bummer</i> is neither glo-fi/chillwave trendfuck nor downer. Pink Skull's last album, 2008's <i>Zeppelin 3</i>, was a sprawling journey through psych, krautrock, Chicago house, rave, and other styles you might hope for on a killer RVNG mix. Jumping between live disco and acid house, with plenty of unexpected turns along the way, <i>Endless Bummer</i> is just as varied and transportative. It's also (relatively) focused. Recorded by Mazarin's Quentin Stoltzfus at the studio of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's Alec Ounsworth, the release is available on mp3 and vinyl, with digital-only bonus tracks.</p>
<p>Multiple online reports have suggested that Pink Skull got a full band together only prior to this album, but that's not the case. Grefe, Geller, and their abettors had actually expanded into a working live unit by 2007, and <i>Zeppelin 3</i>'s dusty, freeform grooves-- the type of percussive dance-punk explorations that make you feel !!! drummer Jerry Fuchs' death all the more acutely-- get a wild and woolly reprise here. On the near-instrumental title track, for example, a variety of multi-layered, South American-flavored percussion parts support skronky sax and synths that alternately screech and lull.</p>
<p>A bigger change since Pink Skull's last outing-- that rare album to feature vocals from both Mirah and Ghostface Killah-- is the new prevalence of Grefe's own singing, with guests' higher-pitched harmonies balancing out his gruff man-voice. Those vocals are nevertheless the weakest part about opener ""Peter Cushing"", a limber disco-funk swooner that trades <i>Zeppelin 3</i>'s music references for film references, but it's an elaborately realized production that would sit nicely beside something from DFA or Modular. Ostinato bass drives the sweeping, majestic ""Oh, Monorail"", as Grefe wryly asserts, ""You know I hate songs about nightlife.""</p>
<p>True to the idea of an album that is more than a collection of dance singles, the contemplative moments on <i>Endless Bummer</i> make return trips more rewarding. Each side of the album closes with elegant ambient synth pieces, while ""Circling Bwi"" toys with disembodied harmonies. The flute-trilling ""Fast Forward to Bolivia, 2000 Years Later, Our Hero Finds Himself..."" could score a futuristic update of that old Disney cartoon <i>The Three Caballeros</i>. A track with an even longer title floats a melodic synth line recalling Aphex Twin over complex drum programming. <i>Endless Bummer</i> won't bring John Hughes back, but it would make a hell of a DJ mix. Maybe even cure butt acne.</p></div>"|13699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13699-endless-bummer/|7.3|Marc Hogan

Reasonable people can quibble over the set's presentation and the relative redundancy of much of its contents, but it's hard to imagine anyone having a problem with how the set positioned Young within a definitive chronological context. <i>Archives</i> may be too awkward to be definitive, but no question they worked well as a portrait of a quixotic artist as a young man.</p>
<p>For the Young faithful, the belated set seems to have gotten those rusty gears moving again. What was next? Will the second volume of the <i>Archives</i> encapsulate Young's formidable mid-1970s stretch? Would <i>Time Fades Away</i> finally appear on CD? Would any of Young's infamous live sets of that era show up? Rumors swirled. Well, Young threw one of his trademark wrenches in the works: What came next was <i>Dreamin' Man</i>, an unexpected jump to Young's 1992 <i>Harvest Moon</i> period-- itself an unexpected detour following the raging Crazy Horse reunion <i>Ragged Glory</i>. <i>Dreamin' Man</i>, deemed the <i>Neil Young Archives Performance Series #12,</i> captures Young solo, performing the entirety of <i>Harvest Moon</i> shortly before the album's release, albeit in a different order and compiled from multiple dates.</p>
<p>Wait, back up. Or actually, fast forward. <i>Neil Young Archives Performance Series #12</i>? The <i>Archive</i> ""performance series"" releases began in 2006 with <i>Live at the Fillmore East</i> aka Volume 2, and continued in 2007 with <i>Live at Massey Hall</i> (Volume 3). <i>Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968</i> (Volume 0) and <i>Live at the Riverboat 1969</i> (Volume 1) appeared in the <i>Archives</i> boxed set this year (along with the previously issued installments). So what happened to the others? It must be in the fine print somewhere that Young didn't need to release this stuff chronologically.</p>
<p>Alas, compared to the treasure trove of releases Young's compiled in the past few years, <i>Dreamin' Man</i> is a real letdown. With its patchwork (and, as of press time, unknown) 1992 sources, the set's neither particularly representative of Young live nor particularly different from the pleasant <i>Harvest Moon</i> album itself (cheering and lack of  backing vocals, strings and session hands aside). Young's voice is in fine fragile form on ""Such a Woman"" and ""From Hank to Hendrix"", and not that the original versions of the album's tracks were ever larded up with embellishments, but it's always nice to hear Young this stripped down.</p>
<p>Yet these versions adhere so closely to the studio versions, there's really little reason beyond completist impulse to pick them up again in this form. <i>Dreamin' Man</i> runs a mere five minutes longer than its original counterpart. Heck, the epic ""Natural Beauty"" was presented live on<i> Harvest Moon</i> to begin with. Then there's the possibility that <i>Dreamin' Man</i>, like its Performance Series predecessors, will just end up on a future <i>Archives</i> boxed set somewhere down the line anyway. There's no reason to believe it won't be, but after the amount of time and effort put into delivering <i>Archives</i>, wait for that boxed set at your peril.</p></div>"|13708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13708-dreamin-man/|5.0|Joshua Klein

The same could be said for the other Score! releases-- the two publicly available compilations (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12908-score-twenty-years-of-merge-records-the-covers/"" target=""_blank"">The Covers</a></i>, released in April, and the newly released <i>The Remixes</i>), as well as the 14 subscription-only compilations curated by a seemingly disparate group of folks that includes ""The Office""'s Mindy Kaling, novelist Jonathan Lethem, and <i>bon vivant</i> David Byrne. All these objects are examples of the implicit trust (or, if you prefer a more blunt phrasing, brand loyalty) that, to some extent, exists in the indie music world between the consumer and the purveyor. At the very least, it most definitely existed back when Merge Records engaged in the time-honored indie label tradition of glue-and-paste record-sleeve parties.</p>
<p>Now, in an environment where labels are almost secondary channels through which fans can acquire their favorite tunes, the power of a label's brand is diminishing in conjunction with its profit margin. According to Merge's other co-founder/Superchunk member, Mac McCaughan, this waning of influence comes at a time when the importance of such branding is perhaps at an all time high. He recently mentioned in <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/11/roundtable_discussion_the_role_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an indie-label roundtable</a> organized by NPR contributor and former Sleater-Kinney member Carrie Brownstein: ""The Internet allows you access to all the music you could want, and that's the problem-- if you don't know what you are looking for, it's like trying to find a good record in a thrift shop. So the label is... a filter, or at least a starting point for fans.""</p>
<p>In that rather stark light, the Score! releases can be viewed as a sort of prospectus for listeners, showing potential customers both the breadth and depth of their catalog, and their standing and influence within this musical community-- a label doesn't get to put out a charity remix compilation featuring far-flung folks like Barbara Morgenstern, Four Tet, and Jason Forrest without earning the respect of its peers. Thankfully, <i>The Remixes</i> is more than just a display of the power of the Merge Records Rolodex. Like any compilation, it's got its share of lackluster moments, but most of the material here presents both the remixer and the remixed in a flattering light.</p>
<p>Of course, cherry-picking highpoints from this release would be the best way to tackle it, but listeners who opt to go from start to finish can take solace knowing that the album is bookended by two of the compilation's high points. To open things, Caribou takes a two-minute track (""Kalgon"") from Polvo's first full-length (<i>Cor-Crane Secret</i>) and expands it into an eight-minute epic, transforming the group's fractured brand of post-rock into something more sedate and spacious. At the other end of the record, there's the Junior Boys' take of Lambchop's ""Nashville Parent"", which reduces the source material to its haunting choral melody, and makes an alluring and lengthy JB-esque track from that one little snippet. In addition to offering of the album's remix highlights, Caribou manages also to be the beneficiary of a favorable treatment, courtesy of Lambchop compatriots Hands Off Cuba-- they add a persuasive syncopated backbeat to the diffused atmospheric musings of <i>Andorra</i>'s ""Irene"".</p>
<p>Remixers like Barbara Morgenstern (working with Pram's ""Mother of Pearl"") and John McEntire of Tortoise (on Spoon's ""The Ghost of You Lingers""), opt for a deceptively fussy approach that works hard at staying true to the song at hand. Jason Forrest (AKA DJ Donna Summer), on the other hand, doesn't do much to the Arcade Fire's ""No Cars Go"" except add some ominous synth flatulence that turns an already anthemic song into something even more grandiose (for better or worse). Along similar like-or-lump lines are the Blow's take on Portastatic's ""Drill Me""-- essentially a Blow song, but written over the bassline of the Portastatic tune-- and +/-'s take on the Rosebuds' ""Bow to the Middle"", which gives the duo the Postal Service treatment. Maybe Xiu Xiu's 52-card-pickup approach to the 6ths' ""Volcana!"" qualifies as well, though its chaotic fragmented approach might put off even the most patient listeners. The only truly regrettable remixes on this collection are Four Tet's rote rejiggering of Guv'ner's ""Baby's Way Cruel"" (which takes the source tune's chorus, and loops/ Auto-Tunes it <i>ad nauseum</i> over some <i>pro forma</i> dance beatz) and a not-so-fresh and ultra-flutey rendering of the Magnetic Fields' ""Washington, DC"" by Mark Robinson.</p>
<p>Even if his remix leaves something to be desired, Robinson's presence on this compilation could be seen as totemic, if not simply a tribute-- his TeenBeat label, one of indie rock's most respected and individualistic bastions, and no doubt an influence during Merge's salad days, will be celebrating its 25th anniversary next year. While TeenBeat's certainly not working the same fields as its younger pupil, both labels exemplify the passed-down hands-on DIY aesthetic that's fueled the Amerindie underground for decades. Fittingly, <i><a href=""http://www.mergerecords.com/blog/2009/09/limited-edition-discography-book-to-benefit-charity/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Merge Records Companion</a></i> displays the art of the label in a similar hands-on fashion-- instead of just offering pages of record and CD sleeves, this handsome little book gives the browser pictures of hands holding these record and CD sleeves. The hands belong to all members of Team Merge-- the label heads, the PR folks, various other employees, folks in the bands, and family and friends (including Pitchfork contributor Grayson Currin).</p>
<p>Even as the label's profile continues to grow and expand, and the music released by their bands finds its way into big-budget movies and prime-time television shows, Ballance and McCaughan don't want to forget how they got to where they are today, and who's helped them along the way. Cynical folks might view such a gesture simply as smart business, perpetuating a timeless image that appeals to a core demographic while not alienating anyone that's unswayed by such gestures. Those with more than red and black ink on their mind, however, can see such an act for what it most likely is-- a heartfelt show of thanks from a bunch of unabashed music lovers to a bunch of unabashed music lovers.</p></div>"|13754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13754-score-the-remixes-the-merge-records-companion/|6.3|David Raposa

Can you imagine sucking on a mouthful of pennies--  not just the taste of it, but also all the squirms and shudders that  would come to pass? Does it make sense to describe a sound as ""sour""?  If that means anything, does it make such a sound in  a dance track sound appealing? Like something worth savoring? Would  it help or hurt to know that the sour-pennies part is just one of several  parts that run concurrently for almost nine minutes, with some of the  others being an anxiously pitched-up tribal chant and what might well  be a dozen murderous kids clapping?</p>
<p>Luciano is a techno producer whose sound-world  is uncommonly vast and even more uncommonly fertile. In a realm where  steely shades of gray compete for space within formalist grids, Luciano  favors subtle washes of color. More than that, though, he plays the  minimalist's game of placing sounds where they can grow. An evocative  rustle here, a suggestive tap there-- something interesting will always  happen in between such things if the conditions are made right.</p>
<p>They certainly are in ""Los Niños de  Fuera"". That's the first track on <i>Tribute to the Sun</i>, and  it works as both a functional charge and a wide-open statement of intent.  As the distended vocal wail (the sour-penny part) duels with the handclap  chant, the effect is simultaneously ghostly and bursting  with life-- something both exotic and immediately identifiable. It's  as good an encapsulation of Luciano's aesthetic as anything he has  done.</p>
<p>The whole album makes good on the wide  spread of Luciano's sound, which shares a lot with the lilting experimentalism  of Ricardo Villalobos and so many others tracing techno lines these  days between South America and Europe. (Luciano has roots in Chile and  a home in Switzerland.) ""Celestial"" follows the album-opener with a percussive  mix of hand-drum runs and minimal house beats that scan as South American  for all their airy, woody timbres and especially their patience. They're  also trademark Luciano in the way they're haunted by a humid bass-line  that seems to be humming to itself when not distracted to silence by  something happening out of ear-shot.</p>
<p>Tracks like ""Conspirer"" and ""Hang  for Bruno"" take mellow forays through melodic passes, the latter  with a gorgeous quasi-trumpet sound that would've worked on Miles Davis  and Gil Evans' <i>Sketches of Spain</i>. But it's the dance tracks that  prove most striking. ""Africa Sweat"" features vocals by Senegalese  singer Ali Boulo Santo and an awful lot of touch, in the infectious  rhythms as well as some subtle but wowing EQ-tweaks on the kora and  drum sounds. The same subtlety plays into ""Metodisima"", which  runs through an IDM egghead's store of rhythmic ideas while sounding  effortless and contented. Much of Luciano's best handiwork on<i> Tribute  to the Sun</i> works like that: It's easy to miss certain things in  the rush or swell of the mood, but it's just as pleasing to go back  and try to take stock of all that he's doing without making too big  a show of it.</p></div>"|13585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13585-tribute-to-the-sun/|8.3|Andy Battaglia

The percussion heavy, often amelodic beast came off as needlessly difficult and even lazy to some staffers, yet Dominique Leone claimed it to be, in so many words, the easiest entry point in the OOIOO catalogue. I don't begrudge either extreme viewpoint: OOIOO's output is divisive for the simple reason that the band has a unique capacity to both wow and disappoint. To call the new <i>Armonico Hewa</i> one of the band's best mostly acknowledges the group has refined its curatorial voice.</p>
<p>While not overtly acknowledging Boredoms comparisons, the group (founded by original Bore Yoshimi P-We in the mid 1990s) teases expectant Boredom-crazed trainspotters by sonically orbiting the mothership but never quite giving in to the white-hot bombast of its predecessor. At the same time, the group frustratingly ""rewards"" the careerist patience of its growing fanbase by fiddling with band dynamics with every release. You really never know what you're going to get, but it usually ranges between a take on Slits-esque post-punk to the incomprehensible stutter-start No Wave splendor pioneered by the antecedent Boredoms catalogue, all meaning abstracted out into pseudo-lingual screech. The first track on <i>Taiga</i>, for example, is a mess of jungle drums falling over one another, Yoshimi belting out like a megalomaniac cheerleader and announcing the abrupt (if brief) renunciation of the group's melodic sensibilities. What results is often ballyhooed, sometimes brilliant, but it almost always leaves sonic travelers all packed up for one of the group's pop-tinged psychedelic sojourns out in the cold.</p>
<p><i>Armonico</i> morphs between musical touchstones but engages the listener much more directly. ""O O I A H"" updates spacy funk with guitars in full face-melt mode and supporting members belting out a falsetto chant, but ""Ulda"" proffers a wonky, new age keyboard chord preset before morphing into a more familiar guitar-driven drone. Space-age rock guitar riffs remain a prominent signpost, but up against the monolithic axe slabs rub such dated synthesizer lines lifted from progressive electronic pioneers. Manic drumming abounds, metronomic but paradoxically indebted to the languid beatkeeping of centuries of world cultures. A notable referent is not only the rhythms of Africa, but those as transposed by progressives sharing an equatorial gaze such as Bruford-era King Crimson. OOIOO's drummer, Ai, came on board for 2006's <i>Taiga</i>, a record which arguably let its new percussive weapon direct the group's usually holistic jams. The group's previous record, <i>Kila Kila Kila</i>, suffered a similar problem in aimless, almost tuneless guitar riffage. Thing is, OOIOO operate best as a democratic entity, forming compositions out of the blind ambiguity of improvisation and the relative economy of instrumental balance. On <i>Armonico Hewa</i>, for the first time in years, the balance struck by the group's best work is approximated while largely preserving the same display of technical chops on their last two records.</p>
<p>The group is also best served by developing the possibilities of their constituents' voices as instruments. Highlights like ""Be Sure to Loop"" from <i>Feather Float</i> and the incomparable, uneven singsong chorus of <i>Gold and Green</i>'s ""Mountain Book"" elevate the female voice, sometimes to endless heights and sometimes to fall off false plateaus. <i>Armonico</i> casts the molten steel of meaningless syllables into machine-gun bursts, sonar echoes, radioactive dirges, and girl-group coos of the group's best work. It's a monument to the endless possibilities afforded by an improvisational spirit, but more importantly it highlights Yoshimi and her band's tireless and ever-evolving voice.</p></div>"|13750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13750-armonico-hewa/|7.4|Mike Orme

Last year Pyramids, a Denton, Texas, outfit, debuted with a record that sounded as if <i>A Storm in Heaven</i>-era Verve and Blut aus Nord (a French black metal act known for warping sounds in the studio) left master tracks for their albums at the same mixing desk for an unsuspecting engineer to sort out. The result was a mess: blotches of ambience, snatches of vocals, and heavily treated guitars splayed over drum machines pitter-patting this way and that. Fortunately, the album came with a second disc of remixes by Jesu, Blut aus Nord, Birchville Cat Motel, and others. Though necessarily disjointed, the disc showed the potential of collaboration with more focused outsiders.</p>
<p>Ironically, Nadja have also needed an editor. The Toronto shoegaze duo has issued over 20 releases in the past two years. Most are good listens, though Nadja's methodology virtually precludes producing duds. Guitar, bass, and synths go through software and effects, producing an overtone-rich, distorted soup. The tonalities involved are not especially challenging; strip away the technology, and you have pretty chords and melodies. Technology simply adds an element of randomness that helps to make them more prolific.</p>
<p>After collaboration with like-minded acts Fear Falls Burning, Atavist, and Black Boned Angel, Nadja could have churned out yet another enjoyable-but-forgettable effort. Instead, working with Pyramids has produced something remarkably focused. <i>Pyramids With Nadja</i> is still expansive-- it spreads four tracks across almost 58 minutes-- but it is not something to get lost in. Listeners will always know where they are.</p>
<p>The key is vocals. They're not the greatest or worst vocals in the world; they sound like Thom Yorke wandering by the abovementioned mixing desk. But they add a human element to the technology, providing time markers and textural contrast. Pop music often operates through tension and release between vocal and instrumental sections. This record dilates that interplay across long periods of time. It unfolds quite gradually. ""Into the Silent Waves"" is really a 10-minute introduction, massaging in drones and noise until it reaches a stirring density worthy of its name. Vocals enter in the next track, sounding like one of those free-tempo Bono vocal intros in late-1980s/early-90s U2. But instead of dropping into a pop song, the intro hangs and stretches into a gloriously time-free taffy.</p>
<p>Another source of tension and release is piano. Along with vocals, the acoustic instrument provides an unadorned counterpoint to all the technology at work. Notes tinkle here and there, yielding a clean, naked feeling. Sometimes distortion surges in oceanic swells, and sometimes it falls away to small instrumental gestures. Such contrast is refreshing. So much of so-called ""metalgaze"" or modern shoegaze is really new-age music with distortion. Introduction of clearly defined dynamics is almost revolutionary-- until one remembers that the best of the original 90s shoegaze bands still wrote proper, robust songs.</p></div>"|13669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13669-pyramids-with-nadja/|7.2|Cosmo Lee

Murs makes this claim on ""Protagonists"", the leadoff track from his collaboration with fellow indie MC all-star Slug, <i>Felt 3: A Tribute to Rosie Perez</i>, and despite the humility this is more indie hip-hop supergroup than mere side project. With Aesop Rock on production, Felt becomes a triangulation that canvasses almost the entirety of U.S. undie rap in terms of geography and affiliation. So why is this thing kind of a bummer?</p>
<p>It's got nothing to do with Aesop, whose beats go a long way toward invigorating <i>Rosie Perez</i>. Far from the gnarled and difficult production one might expect from a Def Jukie, <i>Rosie Perez </i>shows a good amount of sonic diversity while never straying too far from the sort of chunky, drum-knocking beats Murs and Slug typically rhyme over. You can't accuse <i>Rosie Perez </i>of being hookless: Even if Slug and Murs can't quite nail the double-time flows on ""Felt Chewed Up"", it's still nice to hear these guys do their own cheerleading over some pretty awesome turntable work, and the working man blues of ""Like You"" has an agile, back and forth vigor. The 21-deep tracklist is certainly foreboding, but the skit/interlude/instrumentals ""Kevin Spacey"" and ""Get Cake"" have a guileless charm that justify their inclusion.</p>
<p>But you remember that Atmosphere album <i>You Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're Having? </i>OK, good-- now imagine the exact opposite sentiment. I have no idea what put these guys in such a sourpuss mode, but the celebratory ""we the best"" boasting of ""Protagonists"" proves to be a red herring instead of a mood setter. The rest of the way we get to hear Murs and Slug swap out the kickin' back at the BBQ vibe of their previous releases and go off on so many archetypes/strawmen you wonder if they even think they have fans. Either way, it gets to be awfully oppressive over the span of <i>Rosie Perez</i>'s<i> </i>hourlong runtime for anyone other than the most insatiable consumers of complaint rap.</p>
<p>Hipsters, critics, ""internet rappers,"" rappers who rap about violence (""Deathmurdermayhem"") all get dealt with, but in a manner so vague that their dismissals become toothless. Come on, I'm wearing a cardigan as I type this review-- work with it! Instead they save specificity for tracks boasting the concerned but condescending attitudes towards women I expect from a Taking Back Sunday album. It's one thing to lack sympathy, but Slug and Murs crucially forgo <i>empathy </i>too often, and their subjects come off like set pieces rather than real people-- oddly enough, the fantastical fairy tale character portrait of ""Henrietta Longbottom"" comes off like the most intensely written song on the whole thing.</p>
<p>Even if you can get past the unctuous self-satisfaction, the lyrics are as lame to hear as they are to read. ""Bass for Your Truck"" almost entirely negates the draw of its speaker-blast beat by dogging girls who ""date losers 'cause it makes [them] feel superior."" Though I suppose I'll take that over Slug's insanely obtuse diss that ""the truth is just an excuse that you use to polish up a pair of selfish shoes."" Meanwhile, ""Permanent Standby"" is something along the lines of ""Welcome to the Jungle"" in its cautionary rendering of two women trying to make it in the big city, but the whole thing feels preordained-- both get caught up in drugs, prostitution, and the like, with only a lyric about ""dancing to some dubstep"" standing out as something other than stock characterization.</p>
<p>I dunno, isn't Felt supposed to be a way for Slug and Murs to blow off steam in contrast to their more intense solo albums? Even the old-school party rhymes of ""Revisiting the Styleetron"" are rapped with ""I am being <i>very, very serious</i>"" intonation, and ultimately denying any chance it has at being played at an actual party. At the end of ""Paul Reubens"", it's announced <i>Felt 4</i> will be a tribute to Heidi Fleiss, so I can only hope it augurs a record where the guys are more inclined to, um, enjoy themselves.</p></div>"|13752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13752-felt-3-a-tribute-to-rosie-perez/|5.8|Ian Cohen

The CD portion of <i>Good Evening New York City</i> cuts to the quick, however, omitting as much banter as possible despite being spread out over two discs. At first, this seems to defeat the purpose of the live-concert-on-disc experience. Without the between-song bits, listeners are left with highly energetic and ruthlessly faithful takes on well-worn songs that more often than not fail to live up to their studio counterparts.</p>
<p>In the case of the truckload of Beatles tunes essayed over the course of <i>Good Evening</i>, the qualitative gap between Citi Field and Abbey Road can be Grand-Canyon-esque. Some might chafe at the decision to use of synthesized strings and horns over actual catgut and brass during tunes like ""A Day in the Life"", ""Got to Get You Into My Life"", and ""Eleanor Rigby"", but that's as much a matter of logistics as anything-- recreating those bits of music for a country-spanning stadium tour might be a task that's too Herculean for even someone of McCartney's stature. As for the Wings tunes: old standbys like ""Band on the Run"", ""Jet"", and ""Live And Let Die"" are about what you'd expect, as is the sappy/heartfelt dedication to Linda McCartney, <i>Red Rose Speedway</i>'s ""My Love"". A pleasant surprise is ""Mrs. Vandebilt"", a jaunty <i>Band on the Run</i> cut that might surprise folks that only think of the more famous <i>Band</i> singles when considering Wings.</p>
<p>As contrarian as it might seem to say, McCartney and friends sound their best when they sidestep the greatest-hits cavalcade and give the audience something a little different. These offbeat selections certainly don't get the same reception as the more famous tunes, but it's nice to see McCartney give some of his more recent work a proper airing. He actually dips into that well after the first two songs of the show, following up ""Drive My Car"" and ""Jet"" with ""Only Mama Knows"" from <i>Memory Almost Full</i> and the title track from <i>Flaming Pie</i>. For ""Only Mama Knows"", the replacement of the original's real strings with canned ones is actually an improvement, and hearing someone of McCartney's advanced years sink his teeth into this sordid little ditty about airport-lounge hook-ups is a pleasant surprise. The same goes for ""Flaming Pie"", with the live version injecting the song with a sense of playfulness that the version recorded for the album sorely lacks.</p>
<p>The highlight of the concert's eclectic first-half could be a moving emotionally overcome performance of <i>Tug of War</i>'s ""Here Today"", a song written shortly after John Lennon's death that can still get something in a listener's eye. McCartney also gives the crowd pleasing versions of <i>Flaming Pie</i>'s ""Calico Skies"" (one of the better ballads in Macca's post-Beatles catalog) and the mandolin-driven iPod-shilling single from <i>Memory</i>, ""Dance Tonight"", as well as two songs from the Fireman's <i>Electric Arguments</i>.</p>
<p>After that album's ""Sing the Changes"" gives way to ""Band on the Run"", though, the concert becomes pure fan service, which, if you can come to terms with some of the show's aforementioned shortcomings, isn't half bad. There are some speed bumps along the way, like the treacly ""Day in the Life"" / ""Give Peace a Chance"" medley, and a totally duff sped-up and blister-free outro tacked onto an already lackluster run through ""Helter Skelter"". On the other hand, ""Hey Jude"" gives listeners a more palatable sing-along moment, the band rocks more much convincingly on ""I'm Down"" and ""Paperback Writer"", and Macca's tribute to George Harrison (a take on ""Something"" that begins with McCartney strumming a ukelele gifted to him by Harrison, with the rest of the band gradually entering the fray as the performance transforms into the version of the song most fans recognize) is the highlight of the entire show.</p>
<p>So while the audio portion of this package loses something in the translation from event to document, the performances are good enough to make some listeners wish they were there to witness the spectacle, which is really all one could ask from a set like this. One would think that the live DVD packaged with <i>Good Evening</i> would make that regret grow a little fonder. One would probably stop thinking that after hearing Alec Baldwin's hopelessly portentous introductory voice-over. (If Baldwin's introduction doesn't wear down your resolve, his equally bombastic outro, paired with a somewhat scary ""message to Paul"" from an overamped fan, will no doubt do the trick.)</p>
<p>In case you're not up on your Beatles history: One of the biggest concerts in the Beatles' career took place in 1965 at Shea Stadium, home of Major League Baseball's New York Mets. The McCartney concert documented here takes place across the street from that site at Citi Field, the current home of the Mets. Shea Stadium was closed in 2008, with one of the more notable non-baseball events that year being a Billy Joel concert that featured a McCartney cameo. (Joel's cameo in <i>Good Evening</i>, adding a little extraneous piano and belting to ""I Saw Her Standing There"", was McCartney's way of ""bridging the gap"" between Mets homes old and new.) In his introduction, over a slow-motion montage of the events in question, Baldwin recounts these factoids with the gravitas that one would expect from a speaker documenting an actual important moment in history (or an NFL Films highlight package), not a prohibitively priced rock concert. There's also the matter of Baldwin, and McCartney, repeatedly talking about the July concert ""opening"" Citi Field. While even diehard Mets fans might agree that the music at these McCartney shows was probably the best thing played at Citi Field in 2009, the Mets celebrated the field's official opening day way back in April, and played plenty of baseball prior to Sir Paul showing up.</p>
<p>Once the concert actually starts, it's all fine and good so long as the camera stays trained on the stage. However, for the purposes of this DVD, there were multiple cameras scattered through the stadium, allowing fans to film the concert from their vantage point. It's a nice idea in theory, to make fans feel part of the event and to give those at home a sense of what it was like to be there. That sort of footage makes for great viewing during some of the sing-alongs, or when the stage pyro goes off during ""Live and Let Die"". But when the folks in the editing room decide to cut away from the group to show fans dancing in the concourse area, screaming, or sharing some awkward PDAs with innocent bystanders and/or offering their thoughts on how awesome and amazing the show is, it's a bit distracting.</p>
<p>The only showy directorial flourish that the <i>Good Evening</i> DVD manages to pull off is, on paper, the most questionable one. During the performance of ""I'm Down"" (one of the songs played by the Beatles during their Shea show), the film flips back and forth between the modern-day footage and film of the Beatles playing the same song during the Shea concert. There's a slight disjoint in switching between the elder Paul and his much younger counterparts, never mind the atmosphere of the two shows-- the Citi Field crowd isn't lacking for enthusiasm, but they'd need a lot more sugar in their diet to match the unfettered frenzy that the Shea crowd achieves. As McCartney recounts between songs, the band could barely hear themselves over the Shea crowd, thanks in no small part to having their performance pumped through the stadium's rickety PA system. The performance footage definitely corroborates that-- McCartney breathlessly screams out the song's words, while Lennon and Harrison convene near an electric piano, offering their harmonies in a state of shock and awe, and with Lennon giving the keys a pounding worthy of Jerry Lee Lewis. It's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't (or wouldn't) offer more footage of the Shea show as a bonus to this package.</p>
<p>If anything, one of the pluses of these crowd inserts is they distract from McCartney's cornier bits of stage patter, as well as some of the more regrettable images used as backdrops. This isn't to say that it's not fun to hear McCartney talk about how a faux-classical guitar lick he and Harrison used to play as teenagers became the basis for ""Blackbird"", or to see footage of the <i>Band on the Run</i> cover-art photo shoot play behind the band on the big screen. It's just a bit of a bummer when Macca resorts to tried-and-true Pavlovian call-and-response between-song shtick while switching between instruments, and even the most zealous Obama supporter would probably find it a bit much to see the President's visage drawn and redrawn in twinkling multi-colored lights during ""Sing the Changes"". Of course, touches like this-- the banter, the backdrops, the shots of the crowd-- are endemic of what Pitchfork's Stuart Berman called ""McCartney's unwavering dedication to maintaining his cheery, 'cute one' persona."" To expect anything different at a show of this magnitude, or of a document of said show, would be expecting too much.

We can sympathize with her hazy recollection of the specifics-- <i>Florine </i>leaves a lingering impression of unreality in its wake. A breadcrumb trail of piano and synthesizer guide us through the misty forest  of Barwick's voice, and we come out on the other side wondering if it really happened. The mood is blissful and bewitching; lost, but somehow secure. <i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Using a loop station and pedals to produce cyclical patterns on the fly, Barwick's work can't help but recall Brian Eno's </span>Music for Airports</i>. Even so, <i>Florine </i>feels bracingly intimate and original, in its hieroglyphic way.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The most cunning thing is how the music seems wordless at first, then divulges gentle commands, both real and imagined-- <i>stay</i>, <i>higher</i>, <i>come back</i>, <i>choose</i>. Because of the album's spare substance, these little imperatives take on a divine weight. And divinity is the spark that gets <i>Florine </i>going. Barwick begins with a halogen hymn, ""Sunlight, Heaven"", and then builds a cathedral in the sky, ""Cloudbank"". But when ""The Highest"" dips into tones of serene lament, her sacred equanimity begins to slide. ""Choose"" chirrups like Enya doing Kate Bush; ""Anjos"" spills Glassian waterfalls of piano; ""Bode"" epitomizes the cherubically<span> </span>neurotic flutter of <i>Florine</i>'s second half.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Nothing you can say about <i>Florine </i>directly accounts for its elegiac, magnificent aura. Except maybe this: Barwick has remarked that the album was inspired by her memories of playing music without instruments in church, and the course it charts, out of the choir loft and into the more fluctuant realms of leftfield pop and post-minimalism, could represent... gosh, all kinds of narratives: the loss of received values, the fading of religious conviction, the basic human learning curve from clean myth to murky reality. How fitting that the first song after the opening trio of tearjerkers, at the moment when the spiritual seems to lose ground to the postmodern, is called ""Choose"". This blend of uplifting sounds and postlapsarian concept might account for the music's sorrowing, joyful, dreamlike impression-- it moves in two directions at once, floating upwards to describe a fall.</p></div>"|13735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13735-florine/|8.2|Brian Howe

Their Day-Glo party had been going on for hours and  the night was still youngish, their pupils weren't quite the appropriate  size, and everything sounded like a really awesome idea. Since then,  Urdur ""Earth"" Hákonadóttir, the singer whose robust wail  was all over the last couple of GusGus albums, has left the band, they've  hooked up with the Cologne minimal techno label Kompakt, and Iceland  has gone into a financial tailspin that makes the U.S. economy look  positively hearty by comparison. GusGus's seventh album isn't quite  a hangover, and there's still a party going on-- but the party is somewhere  far away.</p>
<p>Sometimes that's literal: the  bass thump that underscores these six songs sounds like it's echoing  across an expanse of frozen desert. <i>24/7</i> is unmistakably a dance  record, but it's about the most ascetic, burned-out, pissed-off electronic  dance record anyone's made since Depeche Mode's ""Fly on the Windscreen"".  (GusGus borrows a lot of mid-80s Depeche Mode's synth tones here, actually.)  Its lyrical themes are exile, bitterness, overwork, and the emptiness  of sex, and almost all of its beats are muted and clipped, as if the  group's longtime core of Biggi Veira and President Bongo are reserving  their machine's full strength in case they need it later. The album's  title comes from ""On the Job"", which follows two verses of  work-ethic boasting with a deliberately insipid sing-song come-on (""I  wanna make you happy 'cause I like you a lot..."")-- in its context,  it sounds like a weary prostitute's pitch.</p>
<p>Dance music's usual strategy  for dealing with hard economic times is pointed irony, and the claim  that dancing is some kind of refuge from the bad stuff: think of Donna  Summer's ""She Works Hard for the Money"" or Chic's ""Good  Times"". GusGus, on the other hand, are just sarcastic and indignant.  ""If you can't tolerate my kind you can kiss my fucking ass,""  Daniel Ágúst Haraldsson spits on ""Hateful""; when he croons  ""I feel like dancing"" on the opening track, it's only so he  can follow it up with the punch line-- ""...on the thinnest ice.""  (Then the disco backing singers show up to repeat ""feel like dancin'""  a million times, their voices reduced to hollow ricochets between the  speakers.) The only hint of hedonism comes on Jimi Tenor's brief guest  appearance, ""Take Me Baby"", and even his sexed-up muttering  is run through a filter that makes it sound mush-mouthed and creepy.</p>
<p><i>24/7</i> is full of huge,  open spaces with just a few instruments streaking across them-- the sort  of passages that trance producers and DJs tend to use for the sake of  pacing and contrast. Here, though, they're the whole story. The album's  sole instrumental, ""Bremen Cowboy"", is all breakdown and buildup;  it keeps clearing the ground for the big beat and the big hook to come  in, but they never do. And its closing 11-minute epic, ""Add This  Song"", cannibalizes itself into nonexistence. The part Haraldsson  sings is a desperate pitch for itself (to be added like an item on a  DJ's playlist? like a vague acquaintance on Facebook?), and the rest  of the song is fidgeting, flickering synths snipping at each other like  they're running out of power. Dancing won't actually save your life  when everything crashes, GusGus suggests. It might not even give you  pleasure. But what else are you going to do?</p></div>"|13674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13674-247/|6.9|Douglas Wolk

The latest Wes Anderson film, <i>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</i>, had flopped. Mild-mannered bands like the Boy Least Likely To and Belle and Sebastian were about to cross over to the Guster/Ben Folds set. And hey, you hear this guy Kanye West? Precious, indie-label pop has regained some critical currency over the past couple of years, but the most contentious stuff is different now. It has swagger.</p>
<p>At least, Vampire Weekend do. Sweden's the Tough Alliance and the acts on their Sincerely Yours label do, too, though they've obviously spent serious hours pining over old C86 and Sarah Records bands. L.A. baroque-pop quartet Princeton are similarly unapologetic about their self-presentation: boat shoes, a breakout 2008 EP inspired by London's Bloomsbury intellectual scene, and, on debut full-length <i>Cocoon of Love</i>, worldly references to everything from luxury cars and Kafka stories to hip-hop slang. But Princeton have been putting out records since before anyone heard ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"", and the group's singers-- twins Jesse and Matt Kivel-- actually grew up on Princeton Street in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>A little too clever? You're starting to understand the problem with <i>Cocoon of Love</i>. Joined by longtime pal Ben Usen on keyboards and newer addition David Kitz on drums, the Kivels tend toward Jens Lekman's dashing orchestration, unexpected samples, doo-wop finger-snaps, and Eeyore vocals. When they toss in Afro-Caribbean flavors, the effect has more to do with the recent sounds of Gothenburg, Sweden, than with certain young Columbia grads. Nevertheless, for all the names (""Sadie and Andy"", Saul and ""Silvie"") and far-flung locales (Germany, Wall Street, San Diego) in these melodic vignettes about dysfunctional couples, there's little of Lekman's unforced charm. It's as if the songs are still growing into an older relative's finest suit.</p>
<p>Princeton do better here when they outfit their jaunty tunes in more atmospheric styles: the frayed synth-pop of ""Martina and Clive Krantz"" and ""Worried Head"", the shoegaze whorls on ""I Left My Love in Nagasaki"", or the chiming tropical reverie of ""Calypso Gold"". Waltzing acoustic finale ""The Wild"", however, with its clumsy poetry, is an even bigger let down than Camera Obscura's own Leonard Cohen pastiche, ""Your Picture"", itself the worst song on the Glasgow band's still-great <i>Underachievers Please Try Harder</i>. Sure, Lekman remembers Warren G, Vampire Weekend appreciate Lil Jon's lack of modesty, and TTA have covered 50 Cent, but Princeton's ""Stunner Shades in Heaven"", featuring the kind of squeaks Serge Gainsbourg used to elicit from Brigitte Bardot (and an Arthur Russell quote you'll see coming a line away), is once again a bit too-- har har-- on the nose.</p>
<p>If <i>Cocoon of Love</i> wants to be something bigger than it is, well, there are worse sins. Like Vancouver's equally mannered No Kids, Princeton are stretching beyond the staid chamber-pop of former tourmates Ra Ra Riot-- let alone Noah and the Whale or the disappointing new Boy Least Likely To single-- and that's to be applauded. They've even performed with a dance troupe at Lincoln Center as part of a Virginia Woolf event. And Jesse Kivel has made fine, Air France-style beach fantasy-pop under the name Kisses. None of this makes it any easier to stomach when, on <i>Cocoon of Love</i>'s ""Korean War Memorial"", you hear a weirdly accented voice crooning, like nothing so much as a karaoker's Lekman, ""You said to me that you liked indie rock."" Here's the thing about swagger: You gotta own it.</p></div>"|13677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13677-cocoon-of-love/|5.9|Marc Hogan

It wasn't ""Umbrella""; however ubiquitous, that megasmash's most meaningful and believable utterances-- ""ella, ella, eh, eh, eh""-- meant nothing. It wasn't February 8, 2009, when Chris Brown beat her with enough force to warrant a 50-yard, three-year restraining order; though that incident and its aftermath informs most of <i>Rated R</i>. And it wasn't her piercing, uncomfortable, and ultimately valiant interview with Diane Sawyer, where she embraced her role as <i>de facto</i> domestic violence spokesperson with a level-headed understanding far beyond her 21 years.</p>
<p>On 2008's no. 1 single ""Take a Bow"", Rihanna blew off a philandering numbskull and delivered her most realistic performance to date. When she scoffed ""<i>please</i>"" at the whimpering chump 43 seconds into the track, she officially put the ice queen routine behind her and entered the realm of full-blooded pop stars. (Her newly severe, emo-boy-esque haircut seen in the song's video did not hurt, either.) ""Take a Bow"" was witty, funny, and as full of attitude as kiss offs come, and Rihanna definitely sounded like she was having fun with the imagined breakup. Fallouts mark <i>Rated R</i> as well, though they are decidedly heavier. Over the course of the album, Rihanna puts a revolver to her temple on ""Russian Roulette"", recalls ""white outlines"" on ""Cold Case Love"", and even threatens to crash head-on into a boyfriend on ""Fire Bomb""-- not exactly the most politically correct metaphor in the age of IEDs, but it does get her point across. In a recent interview, Rihanna described the <i>Rated R</i> recording sessions as ""theraputic,"" and the vitriolic, rough, raw end product is about as brutal as you'd expect.</p>
<p>The brutality comes in two modes: sentimentally self-lacerating and superhero defiance. The bulletproof guise is good for the record's high point on ""Hard"", a strutting statement of power bolstered by a roiling undertow of a beat from ""Umbrella"" producer Tricky Stewart. ""Brilliant/ Resilient/ Fan mail from 27 million,"" huffs Rihanna, slyly acknowledging the need for such an anthem while justifying its existence. The similarly chest-thumping ""Rockstar 101"" and ""G4L"" are harder to justify considering their mindless boasts and torpid production. The more melodramatic fare is also mixed. For every ""Fire Bomb""-- a stunningly overzealous power ballad Pink would blow shit up for-- there's something like the actually-quite-dim ""Stupid in Love"" or the lost-in-translation lesbian farce ""Te Amo"", both of which aim for Almodóvar but end up closer to Telemundo.</p>
<p>The ballads also suffer due to the fact that they require singing-- which still isn't Rihanna's forte (tellingly, aforementioned highlight ""Hard"" is a near-rap with single-syllable ""yeahs"" for a hook). The strumming ""Photographs"" comes replete with teary-eyed remembrances (""all I've got are these photographs"") and a hint of poignant anachronism-- after all, most photos are a ""delete"" button away from nothingness nowadays. On the track, Rihanna is more wounded than ever, her voice offering as-yet-unheard levels of tenderness. Then, just as her sorrow peaks, the track is sunk by an infuriatingly tone-deaf and goofy verse from producer will.i.am, who can be a real asshole. It's a frustrating moment from an album pockmarked with them.</p>
<p>Like its lyrical themes, <i>Rated R</i>'s tones are decidedly darker than anything Rihanna's done; notably, UK dubstep producers Chase &amp; Status provide production on a few tracks, marking a U.S. pop breakthrough for the bass-riddled genre. Specifically, the undercooked-yet-alluring ""Wait Your Turn"" shows promise for future dubstep crossovers, and the loping style matches Rihanna's dourness for better and worse (see: the cartoonish tough-chick clunker ""G4L""). Canned rock flourishes turn ""Rockstar 101"" [ft. Slash], ""Russian Roulette"", and ""The Last Song"" into instantly-dated missteps from a bygone era when a Slash feature was cool. The Stargate-produced ""Rude Boy"" is the flightiest thing here, a club trifle that would fit snugly on 2007's <i>Good Girl Gone Bad</i>. It also trumps much of the album's ""riskier"" material.</p>
<p>Talking about <i>Rated R</i> in a promo interview, Rihanna said, ""Anybody can make a hit, but I wanted a real album."" Such is the flawed logic of a newly legal drinker who has known only skyrocketing commercial success. While the singer is trying to accentuate her individuality and independence with this album, the ""dark"" and/or ""mature"" LP is nothing new-- from Janet Jackson's <i>The Velvet Rope</i> to Christina Aguilera's <i>Stripped</i> to Kelly Clarkson's <i>My December</i>, the rebel record is now a <i>de rigeur</i> coming-of-age maneuver. Based on <i>Rated R</i>, Rihanna's artistic aspirations are currently loftier than her abilities. Then again, her tenacity in the face of the unimaginable public humiliation this year is beyond brave. For a while, Rihanna lacked a compelling narrative but couldn't yawn without hitting the Top 10. Now her story is overflowing, but her songs aren't sticking as they once did. Not just anybody can make a hit, and no one can make hits all the time.</p></div>"|13740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13740-rated-r/|6.1|Ryan Dombal

Block out your referential nostalgia, your tendency to make punchlines out of Cazals and keytars. Unlearn everything you know about Stock-Aitken-Waterman and gated drums and the synthesizers in ""The Final Countdown"". Try to think about how the music of the era might've sounded to you if you were experiencing it for the first time, without any knowledge of where or when it was made.</p>
<p>Now you're ready to listen to Dâm-Funk. One of Stones Throw's recent breakthrough stars, L.A.'s Damon Riddick spent the 90s as a session keyboardist for assorted New Jack Swing and hip-hop acts (most prominently on the soundtrack to Master P's <i>I Got the Hook-Up</i>), and lately has parlayed his love for music into a popular 80s boogie/funk DJ night, Funkmosphere, at the Venice Boulevard club Carbon. His recent work reflects a confluence of these two bullet points on his résumé, as he jumps from retro-novel intrigue (2008's ""Burgundy City"" b/w ""Galactic Fun"") to indie-crossover remix buzz (his incredible transformation of Animal Collective's ""Summertime Clothes"") to the ambitious sprawl of a five-part debut album series, intended as a mission statement for what he calls ""modern funk.""</p>
<p>That series has been pared down to the 2xCD, 140-minute collection <i>Toeachizown</i>, which shares the name of the collection from which it draws. It's your call how best to experience this stuff; each individual volume of the original <i>Toeachizown</i> series has its own thematic undercurrent (""Hood"", ""Life"", ""Sky"", etc.) and its own strengths, but this condensed aggregation pares it down to a manageable, cohesive 24-track introduction at the cost of editing down a couple of the songs. Either way, you've got a thorough rundown of Dâm-Funk's repertoire this year, which, even in its pared-down form, is an absurdly prolific output-- apparently it would've come out sooner, but the man couldn't stop recording new tracks for it.</p>
<p>Anyone with a thing for g-funk should find instant geek-out recognition in this music, a garage-bound DIY love letter to the post-Worrell musical diaspora that covers everything from Roger Troutman's eternal bounce to the cosmic jazz crossover of the Clarke/Duke Project. In between, you get slow-ride R&amp;B jams (""One Less Day""; ""I Wanna Thank You For [Steppin Into My Life]""), grooves that toy with the more prog- and fusion-influenced corners of funk (""Flying V Ride""), post-disco dance music (""Candy Dancin'""), proto-electro (""Keep Lookin' 2 the Sky""), and just about anything else you might've heard on the SOLAR label 25 years ago. There are nods to the retrofitting treatment that the cream of late-70s/early-80s Moog funk underwent once DJ Quik and Dr. Dre got ahold of it; ""Killdat aka Killdatmuthafu*ka"" actually sounds a bit more like 1992 than 1983, all sinister chords and bop-gun percussion.</p>
<p>But calling Dâm-Funk's music straight-up throwback nostalgia only skirts what's really appealing about it. For the first minute or so, you might dredge up some roller-rink memories, but once that groove sets in-- granite-thick Moog bass coupled with drum machine breaks so propulsive their physical impetus overrides their mechanicalness-- it starts transcending historical allusions and becomes all about structure and groove, about how just plain fucking <i>great </i>fat Roland basslines and Oberheim kick drums sound together. That's about when you get waylaid by one of Riddick's solos-- fluttering and unpredictable, often flowing more like something that might come out of a free jazz sax or an acid rock guitar than a funk synthesizer. It's the secret weapon that underscores how seriously he takes this stuff, the catalyst that should provoke listeners to realize this music isn't just a fun update of a classic sound-- it's a work of real transcendence.</p>
<p>This isn't a comedic tribute to talkboxes and widebrims; there's no Snoop Dogg descending a foggy staircase through a faded VHS haze here. <i>Toeachizown </i>is a deep, astute collection that feels like a natural resuscitation and progression of funk as it stood just before hip hop usurped it. Much in the same way that Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings transform from a reenactment of a circa '66 soul revue to a distinct set of musical personalities the more you listen to them, Dâm-Funk uses all his vintage equipment as a medium to express his own voice, tucking a lot of stealthy forward progress and experimental tendencies between the notes. Chortle at that keytar all you want-- he can still make it sound like the future.</p></div>"|13634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13634-toeachizown/|8.2|Nate Patrin

Talking about the man's career, it's hard not to lapse into hyperbole, to talk like he invented rap, because in some ways he kind of did. The things that make rap what it is in 2009 existed in various forms back in 1986, when <span class=""misspell"">Rakim's</span> career launched, but Rakim isolated, elevated, streamlined, and developed them. The seen-it-all thousand-yard stare, the twisty internal rhyme schemes, the innate sense of the meter of speech and its possibilities, the mystic codes that intrigued just as they alienated, the emphasis on sheer weight of <i>presence</i>-- these are all <span class=""misspell"">Rakim's</span> legacies, and without them, rap would look very, very different.</p>
<p>Rappers and old-head fans talk about Rakim the way they talk about retired legends; but Rakim's out there, hungry, ready to work, making occasional guest appearances. He hasn't recorded an album in 10 years, but he's only one year older than Jay-Z or <span class=""misspell"">Diddy</span>. For a while, he was signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath imprint, at work on a record that seemed so titanic (arguably the greatest rapper ever united with arguably the greatest rap producer) that it almost had to disappoint. But that didn't happen, and here he is, on an album full of budget beats and nobody guest singers, radiating <span class=""misspell"">rinky</span>-dink half-hearted comeback attempt. He deserves much, much better.</p>
<p>On ""Won't Be Long"", <span class=""misspell"">Rakim</span> states his current aim: ""Complete my legacy/ Without compromising my artistic integrity."" In interviews, he's implied that he and Dre parted ways because Dre wanted him to record the sort of accessible gangsta music that's always been Dre's stock-in-trade, something <span class=""misspell"">Rakim</span> wasn't interested in doing. And lyrically at least, <i>The Seventh Seal</i> sounds very much like the album <span class=""misspell"">Rakim</span> wanted to make. There are a lot of love songs on the album, a lot of educating-the-youth songs, a lot of Obama <span class=""misspell"">namechecks</span>. There's one song about God, another about the redemptive power of music. I'm pretty sure he doesn't curse once on the whole LP, and there's not a single crass commercial cash-grab here.</p>
<p>That's great, admirable even, but you also hear what <span class=""misspell"">Rakim's</span> missing without a Dre-level executive producer on board. The beats are generally flat, lifeless <span class=""misspell"">thumpers</span> from unknown producers. And even the few decent beats from decent producers like Jake One or <span class=""misspell"">Nottz</span> have to contend with the guest singers, who show up over and over and who feel like total dead-weight voids. No rapper would be able to maintain a consistent level of force or intensity in settings like these. Understandably, Rakim sounds exhausted more often than not, his laconic basso growl never quite as effortless as it once was. A Dre-type figure could also tell Rakim that it might not be such a good idea to rhyme ""euthanasia"" with ""youth in Asia"" or to point out that ""love backwards is evil,"" simply because it's near-impossible to make moves like these without coming off corny.</p>
<p>But this is still a <span class=""misspell"">Rakim</span> album, and that goes a long way. Some of the man's greatest strengths, like his technical rigor and fluidity, are the sorts of things that naturally wear away with age. But others-- principally the rush that comes just from hearing the <span class=""misspell"">unrushed</span> weight in his voice-- have stuck around. Some of the songs here also make great use of the boundless goodwill that <span class=""misspell"">Rakim's</span> built up over the years. <span class=""misspell"">Rakim's</span> always taken his love songs seriously, committing to them as intensely as he does to his dropping-knowledge tracks; 1990's ""Mahogany"" is my favorite example. He pulls that off a few times here, talking about everyday struggles between couples without sounding like he's pandering or doing token for-the-ladies songs. And on ""Dedicated"", he brings enormous pathos to a song about his recently dead mother, making even the terrible-idea No Doubt sample on the chorus sound acceptable.</p>
<p>But this album still falls way short of what it could be, and I have to wonder how this even happened. Rappers should be lining up to work with this guy, but the only guest rapper on the whole album is perennial C-<span class=""misspell"">lister</span> <span class=""misspell"">Maino</span>. A second-generation Rakim disciple like <span class=""misspell"">Cormega</span> can score DJ Premier and Large Professor beats for <i>his</i> new album, but <span class=""misspell"">Rakim</span> himself gets stuck with pale imitations of those guys' best work. I can't say enough bad things about these hook singers. It's not a new thing for rap veterans to make limp, uninspired new albums that only barely hint at past glories. But it is a new thing for <i>this</i> rap veteran.</p></div>"|13738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13738-the-seventh-seal/|5.6|Tom Breihan

<p class=""MsoNormal"">David ""Moose"" Adamson, as Jookabox (now without the ""Grampall"") hails from the East side of Indy, which is known both for the historic neighborhood Irvington-- which Adamson refers to as ""the Irv""-- and as one of the city's areas of benign neglect.<span> </span>Boarded-up former businesses, neglected slumlord-owned rentals, higher-than-average crime and poverty rates: you know the drill.<span> </span>My uncle used to jokingly tell out-of-towners he was from ""India-no-place,"" as a way of acknowledging the sort of cultural invisibility that guys like Breslin attribute to Indy.<span> </span>On his latest album, <i>Dead Zone Boys</i>, Adamson seems to take up that sense of inconspicuousness and civic inattention, and redefine it as supernatural: ""Dead zone boys wish to take your life away, and the desperate phantoms wish to put you in their place.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sonically, <i>Boys</i> more or less picks up where <i>Ropechain</i> left off, but shapes that album's slapdash collection of half-formed songs and killer loops into something bordering on a B-movie soundtrack-- Adamson's own small-scale <i>Escape From New York</i> maybe.<span> </span>Jookabox is still only half-sane, but this time there's more of a method to the madness. <span> </span>He gets Stockholm Syndrome with his phantasmic captors on the compelling back-to-back opening tracks, before later resorting to the artillery on the grisly guitar freakout ""Gonna Need the Guns/Doom Hope"".<span> </span>Sheet-metal boom-bap rhythms underscore ""East Side Bangs/East Side Fade"", a zombiefied extended metaphor for staying positive in the face of evil temptations, and ""You Cried Me"" is a sped-up hoe-down complete with helium-voiced werewolf-style howls, in which he convinces a girl to come with him to the underground.<span> </span>It doesn't take much: ""Now we can be together forever, you and me livin' side by side.<span> </span>In an evil way! Okay? All right!""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The first half of <i>Boys</i> has all of the action, and the second side can't help but drag a bit, namely the phoned-in ""Zombie Tear Drops"" and the bluesy meditation ""Evil Guh"".<span> </span>And like any cheesy drive-in feature worth taking your date to, <i>Boys</i> lets love win in the end, but on its own horny terms.<span> </span>Closing track ""F.I.T.F. #1"" stands for ""Faith in the Fucking"", and Adamson delivers that refrain in a gas-huffing slo-mo patois.<span> </span>It feels leftover from <i>Ropechain</i>, sure, but it works well here as a closing-credit sequence.<span> </span>So, here we have it: Adamson drops the ""Grampall,"" and sheds most of <i>Ropechain'</i>s ""fidgety surburban druggie"" tendencies as well.<span> </span>In their place, a new schtick more in line with that of Hoosier TV legend <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwCIHqW3QSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sammy Terry</a>, the host of a long-running weekly horror flick showcase that bore his name.<span> </span>Sure, he's kitsch now, but that low-budget Vincent Price routine still spooked the shit out of me when I was a kid.<span> </span>Different medium: no matter.<span> </span><i>That's</i> an Indy indie legacy to follow.</p>

The percussion here is crisp, the tempos insistent-- even peppy at times-- and the guitar is slightly hazy<span> but hardly dreamy. ""In the Fire"" and the Madchester echo of ""How to Fall"" are a far cry from musical wallpaper, and the band rarely embraces atmosphere for atmosphere's sake.</span></p>
<p>The second thing you notice is that, for a band's sixth album (more, if you include Daniel Burton's parallel work in the instrumental Ativin), the disc doesn't sound like the latest endpoint in a gradual evolution as much as a new beginning, and this fresh-start theory makes some sense. <i>The Treatment</i> introduces Early Day Miners' latest lineup change, and with it has come a conscious shift in direction. Gone are the open-ended moodscapes and reverb excursions, making room for a newfound economy and an ear for greater accessibility.</p>
<p><i>The Treatment</i>'s various studio effects are sympathetic to the songs rather than an end unto themselves. Daun Fields' backing vocals constitute perhaps the best effect of all. At the same time, the group doesn't always have a clear destination in mind. ""The Surface of Things"" and ""Spaces"" start off so cool, it's disappointing how static the tracks remain. What's missing is the kind of payoff songs like ""So Slowly"" or (the admittedly long and dreamy) ""Becloud"", to name two highlights, deserve. They glide along on cool basslines or swing with the weight of epic import, but fail to build up any melodic or emotional inertia to lend them greater force.</p>
<p>That's not a real problem when crafting post-rock amorphousness or gauzy soundscapes are the tasks at hand; in those cases, lack of impact is partly the point. Here, however, Early Day Miners may have erred too strongly on the side of concision, overcompensating for past indulgence with a radical shift toward ec

onomy at the expense of edge and impact. It's rarely boring, and often full of promise, but it's a direction that calls for further tweaks, experiments, and exploration to get the balance just right.</p></div>"|13564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13564-the-treatment/|5.6|Joshua Klein

Aptly for a group so fascinated by  travel they enjoy an image as the ultimate electronic pioneers-- ""the  reason music sounds like it does today,"" as one BBC documentary put  it. Let's take for granted then that it's impossible to imagine  modern pop music without Kraftwerk and try a more interesting thought  experiment: Let's try to imagine Kraftwerk without modern pop. What  if they'd released the same body of work and influenced nobody? Would  it still sound as good?</p>
<p>This box set is an opportunity to find  out-- a remastered, sealed-off package of what Kraftwerk (or at least  remaining founder Ralf Hutter) would like you to consider its canon.  This starts with 1974's <i>Autobahn</i>. The three albums Kraftwerk made  before are beloved of many fans, but the group routinely ignore them as inconvenient prologues charting the band's messy discovery of electronics.  <i>The Catalogue</i> skips past these to give you a run of five consecutive  masterpieces, two albums whose flaws are at least intriguing, and then  2003's very fine <i>Tour De France</i>. Most of these remasters are available  as separate issues (due to licensing issues <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/36214-kraftwerk-announce-massive-eight-disc-box-set-reissue-series/"" target=""_blank"">three of them aren't in the U.S.</a>), but the box as a whole is as full a Kraftwerk story  as you're likely to be officially offered. As such it invites you  to consider their achievements and development in relation to themselves,  not to wider history.</p>
<p>So why is <i>Autobahn</i> the official starting  point? I like to think it's because this was the record where the  band suddenly hit on one of the things they could do better than anyone  else-- capture and make beautiful the precise sensations of everyday  activity. Going for a drive, catching a train, using a computer, riding  a bicycle-- these are terribly mundane things to create sound-portraits  of, but Kraftwerk find loveliness and power in them without ever losing  a basic accuracy. You might think of ""Autobahn"" itself-- the 22-minute  breakthrough for this method-- as a perverse take on psychedelia:  a recreation of a mindstate, not the altered state of a trip but the  low-level trance of day-to-day travel.</p>
<p>The electronic arrangements Kraftwerk  were using turned out to be superb tools for achieving this: precise  enough to suggest mechanization and able to showcase the group's gift  for simple, wistful melodies (like <i>Autobahn</i>'s ""Kometenmelodie 2"").  On the follow-up, <i>Radio-Activity</i>, it's these aching, slowly unfolding  tunes that make the deepest impression, on the title track and ""Radioland"".  The album is Kraftwerk at its most melancholy and oblique-- wreathed  in decaying fuzz and crackle and ghostly background tones. It's also  where the band's remastering job is least effective. The remasters  mostly add precision and sharpness to already finely-drawn music--  but <i>Radio-Activity</i>, uniquely for the group, sounds better the more indistinct  it is. The ancient wireless on its cover is the record's ideal medium.</p>
<p><i>Trans-Europe Express</i>, on the other hand,  is Kraftwerk hitting peaks of sublime clarity. Everything they do well  is here: As a hymn to a mode of travel the title suite manages to better  ""Autobahn"", and the opening tracks show off their emotional economy  and subtlety. ""The Hall of Mirrors"" is the most chilling Kraftwerk  song, a hollow man pacing a hollow space pursued by taunting, reflecting  arpeggios. ""Europe Endless"" is a love song to a continent's history  and new-found, hard-won peacefulness.</p>
<p>The cuckoo-clock rhythms of ""Europe  Endless"" turn up again on ""Franz Schubert"", clockwork keyboard  figures that bring to mind the automata which delighted 18th and 19th century courts. As an electronic group Kraftwerk  are routinely called futurists, but far more of their work is informed  by the past. On <i>The Man Machine</i>, their lushest album, they do explore  science-fictional themes, but it's the sci-fi of the 1920s and 1930s-- Fritz Lang's <i>Metropolis</i> and the earliest conceptions of robots.  This era is a constant reference point in Kraftwerk's 1970s material-- a lost time and opportunity in European, and specifically German history,  erased by totalitarianism and war.</p>
<p>Generally, though, <i>The Man Machine</i> is  unified only by consistent loveliness. Nothing has the dynamism or force  of ""Trans-Europe Express"", but the title track, ""Spacelab"", and  especially ""Neon Lights"" are thick, tone-drenched pleasures. Their  next album, <i>Computer World</i>, took this richness and mixed it with rhythmic  drive and conceptual rigour to create the group's most satisfying  record.</p>
<p><i>Computer World</i> is the first album in <i> The Catalogue</i> with no nods to history-- it abandons the 20s and 30s as touchstones and explicitly  relates to the then present day, that giddy era at the start of the  home computer boom. Then as now, tech enthusiasts preached imminent  social transformation with a mix of excitement and hope. Kraftwerk were  happy to reflect this: ""I program my home computer/ Beam myself into  the future."" But as was often the case, their lean arrangements and  simple lyrics put them into a deliciously ambiguous place between delight  and mockery. The appealing bounce of ""Pocket Calculator"" sounds  rather faux-naïve after ""Computer World"" has coolly outlined the  new networks of power which computer technology was enabling.</p>
<p>At the center of <i>Computer World</i> is ""Computer  Love"", its singer lonely and muted amidst some of the most delicately  gorgeous synthwork the band ever crafted. Its interface of desire, alienation,  and technology is a bridge into some of the music on 1986's <i>Techno  Pop</i>, like ""Sex Object"" and ""The Telephone Call"". But where <i>Computer  World</i> seemed timely, this follow-up feels like a bad magazine article:  ""Five Hot Digital Trends for the Mid-80s"". Formerly known as <i>Electric  Cafe</i>, it's a sluggish record and Kraftwerk's weakest by some distance.  The first half is a suite of dry tracks about electronic music itself:  people were making it, apparently. The second half is livelier and funnier,  and the remastered edition adds 1987 remix ""The House Phone"" which  becomes the record's best track-- as its name suggests it has a  little more dancefloor kick than the others.</p>
<p><i>Techno Pop</i>-- so like a Kraftwerk record  and yet so unsatisfying-- suggested that even the best of the group's  material was a couple of bad decisions away from being enormously irritating.  So it's easy to view <i>The Mix</i>-- a selection of their old work, digitised  and retooled to 1990-era specifications-- with suspicion. But there's  some great music on the album: a fierce re-write of ""Radioactivity""  and an edit of ""Autobahn"" that brings out the song's playfulness.  Also, unlike most mix albums of the period this one had a purpose: these  more physical and propulsive versions have fed into Kraftwerk's live  set ever since.</p>
<p>After <i>The Mix</i>, silence for a rumor-filled  decade, and then at last new work: an album about cycling, built around  their magnificent 1983 single ""Tour De France"" and probably their  most thematically focused record ever. This wasn't simply revisiting  old ground: the opening five tracks of the <i>Tour De France</i> CD build into  a rippling 20-minute piece that shares only an idea and a few keyboard  figures with the older song. This music is a wonderful piece of engineering,  with the lightness and strength of a titanium bike frame, all weightless  skitters and low-friction keyboard glide. It brings <i>The Catalogue</i> full  circle, back to the impressionist style of ""Autobahn"" and the marvellous  skill Kraftwerk have of collapsing the distance between the music and  its subject.</p>
<p>If you find <i>Tour De France</i> boring, that's  surely in part intentional-- the aim of the distance cyclist is to  hit an equilibrium where a genuine fusion of human and technology can  take place, muscle and mechanics operating in a virtuous feedback loop.  As with a lot of the music on <i>The Catalogue</i>, it shows Kraftwerk's  true strength: not as futurists or speculators or robots, but as participants  in technology. They are a band who, more than any other, catch in music  what interaction with machines really feels like-- sometimes glorious,  sometimes lonely and frightening, occasionally very funny. By presenting  their story in its own context, <i>The Catalogue</i> does this remarkable talent  a great service.</p></div>"|13742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13742-the-catalogue/|9.5|Tom Ewing

But by being so blatant about what it did wrong-- combining notoriously sloppy and notoriously methodical artists-- the Lips and GZA may have actually have provided an unintentional boost.</p>
<p>No such problem exists in BlakRoc-- the Black Keys recently toe-dipped into hip-hop by having Danger Mouse produce their last LP and their reverent, values-based approach to the blues nicely dovetails with the ethos of the MCs involved-- mostly guys who came up in NYC during the late and mid-1990s. And while this simpatico relationship ensures that <i>BlakRoc</i> allays all fears of being about as good as any previous rap-rock full-lengths, for better or worse, it ultimately serves as both the floor <i>and </i>the ceiling. If you're okay with ""solid"" being the main descriptor for a project boasting such well-known talent, <i>BlakRoc </i>won't be a disappointment.</p>
<p>In the track review for ""Stay Off the Fuckin' Flowers"", Tom Breihan described it as resembling Edan's ""<i>Beauty and the Beat</i>, but with good rapping,"" which is pretty dead-on in two aspects. Raekwon is still in Gemstar-sharp Iron Chef mode here, in a performance worthy of comparison to deeper cuts from <i>Cuban Linx</i>... <i>Pt. 2. </i>Granted, it widely deviates from the typical subject matter on <i>BlakRoc-- </i>I suppose it's a testament to the respect given the Black Keys that most raps here work within the standard blues-rock tropes of hard times (most notably, ""Hard Times"") and no-good women (""Hope You're Happy"", ""Tellin' Me Things"").</p>
<p>More importantly, in spite of the presence of tireless self-promoters like Damon Dash, Jim Jones, and RZA, they never go overboard and play up the masturbatory ""look at us, we made a rap record with psychedelic rock guitars"" angle like Edan and his ilk did, although the acknowledgment of the guys behind the boards make for the most awkward lyric on the whole thing-- ""fuck the white ones, the Black Keys got so much soul.""</p>
<p>But the Keys and Mos Def make the most of the stoned salutation ""On the Vista"", the sort of sing-rapping about the kind of ""total control"" one only feels in a hallucinatory state-- it wouldn't feel out of place on <i>The Ecstatic</i>, and most importantly, it could close the door on Mos relying on Fishbone as being some sort of apotheosis of rock music. Meanwhile, short-lived Dipset hook lady Nicole Wray (the one who made 1998's awesome ""Make It Hot"" as just plain Nicole) simmers admirably on the streetlamp-lit noir&amp;B of ""Why Can't I Forget Him"".</p>
<p>And yet for all the brown-acid reverb, <i>BlackRoc</i> often comes off as a resolutely sober affair-- mutual respect leads to no on stepping on each other's toes or letting loose. I suppose the RZA's having fun, even if it rarely feels like anyone else is in on it-- he's strictly in quasi-erudite Bobby Digital mode here, where you actually prefer his nonsensical wordplay to moments when he's actually intelligible. Even if it never really syncs up, the attempt to match Zep-drum reverb to double-time Dirty South flows on ""Coochie""-- which isn't available on digital versions of the record-- turns out to be the record's riskiest sonic experiment, but even that seems too restrained. Yes, a song called ""Coochie"" with Ol' Dirty Bastard and Ludacris is too restrained: Think about that for a second.</p>
<p>But even if the lame parts of <i>BlakRoc</i> are more noticeable than the enjoyable, what really sticks out is how easy this all feels--- not once does anything feel like awkward ambassadorship. For a project that spawned an accompanying tricked-out Camaro, it's a pleasantly modest album. And really, it's cool that a somewhat non-obvious choice like the Black Keys get to be involved with something like this. So, fine if BlakRoc's impact isn't always musical: At the very least, its optimistic approach feels pretty exciting when too many hip-hop fans are more willing to peel off self-satisfied jeremiads about the genre's demise.</p></div>"|13747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13747-blakroc/|6.7|Ian Cohen

After self-releasing most of them in limited runs, he made the jump to Barsuk in 2008 with <i>Your Anchor</i>, his best Lackthereof album yet. That makes now an opportune time for him to look back on his long-running project and give people who haven't followed it (i.e., almost everyone) a chance to sample the best moments. It wisely doesn't draw at all from <i>Your Anchor</i>, focusing on material from the lesser-heard records. Seim has doodled illustrations and scribbled out complete lyrics for every track, and he's given it a title that reflects the central inner conflict of his life during the time he made most of this music.</p>
<p>Seim plays and sings everything on all these records, and while you'd expect him to be a good drummer, he's good at writing bass and guitar parts that suit his talents, and his vocals, while mildly raspy, suit the songs. He's willing to push himself, too: His wordless self-harmony on 2003's ""Safely in Jail"" sounds good over popping programmed drums. It's stylistically similar to solo Thom Yorke, and when he brings the live drums and a small army of electronic noises in, it brings the song vividly to life. The conflict between Seim's religious upbringing and his own worldview is the subject of a few songs, but none highlight it more clearly than ""Abstinent Dry Sex"", which rides a fantastic bassline to the lines, ""You're bulimic/ I'm in love with porn/ I'd rather love you/ But that would be wrong.""</p>
<p>The compilation is sequenced out of chronological order, but a quick check through the booklet makes it clear how much Seim's craft has developed over the years. The best of the four instrumentals is the most recent, 2008's ""Both of Us"", which is beautifully contemplative and essentially free of gimmicks in the production. The best track on the whole compilation, the closing ""The Columbia"", also dates from last year and benefits from being streamlined and spooky. Most Lackthereof albums before <i>Your Anchor</i> were uneven, so it's nice to have the bulk of the strongest tracks all in one place, though the occasional indulgence does slip through. ""Pimping Is Never An Easy Task!"" from 2002 is built up with shuddering percussion to the point of being cluttered, while the Wendy Carlos synthesizer solo that opens ""Half Off Drugz"" is amusing once.</p>
<p>Other places where Seim appears to be entertaining himself work better-- the fuzzed-out Zeppelin crunch of ""Let U Down as Good as I Did"" or the odd beatboxing on ""Miko"", for instance. Lackthereof is an interesting and prolific project, and this compilation should make it easier to approach for people working their way back toward it from Menomena. Seim's well of inspiration runs deep, and people who've enjoyed his more high-profile work would be well served to check out the project that got him started.</p></div>"|13713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13713-a-retrospective-1998-2008-or-i-was-a-christian-emo-twentysomething/|7.2|Joe Tangari

Just listen to the congealing synthesizers on ""'83 Wildin"" or the absinthe jazz piano of ""Ultra '88 (Tribute)"" from 2002's <i>Primitive Plus </i>and try to figure out just how they might've played in their real-world titular years-- not to mention 2005's <i>Beauty and the Beat</i>, which took its Bomb Squad-in-Beatles-wigs premise to a bewildering, psychedelic extreme. The fact that Edan's only rarely managed to create anything as memorable since then-- indeed, much of anything at all-- has remained one of underground rap's more nagging absences. And his first major undertaking in four years turning out to be a 29-minute mix might feel like more of a stopgap than the long-anticipated follow-up that fans have almost given up waiting for.</p>
<p>Except that <i>Echo Party</i> is, as stopgaps go, completely deranged. Traffic Entertainment Group got the idea to set a mostly idle Edan loose on their old-school hip-hop archives for the purposes of creating a mix, and some two years' worth of mysterious alchemy later, the end result is, for good and bad, one of the weirder attempts to revamp the concept of an early-80s hip-hop tribute. It starts out conventionally enough-- a recognizable post-disco clap-break with some familiar vintage rockin'-it-shockin'-it lyricism, albeit sourced from a 12"" with more crackle than a burning sheet of bubble wrap. Then a creaky sounding piece of vintage electronics comes squeaking in like some kind of robotic slide whistle, the introductory break gets backspun into a sort of hissing slurp-beat, and things just go more haywire from there.</p>
<p>Not to say that <i>Echo Party </i>isn't well-constructed. The mix does a surprisingly good job of maintaining a tight, steady momentum for most of its length, and there's more than its fair share of percussive breakdowns-- sourced from hip-hop, funk, disco, and go-go rhythms-- that prove Edan's ear is just as finely tuned to a great straight-up beat-drop as it is to the psychotropic inner-space quirks that've been his calling card. And it's not purely obscurantist thanks to appearances by the fondly remembered Mr. Magic and Spyder-D. But it does seem to draw from some of the odder corners of the epoch: ""Rapper's Delight"" basslines gone filthy, session-band noodling, raps about ditching this doomed planet for a life in outer space. And there are almost no moments where an MC's line is left unmolested-- lines get flipped and reversed, chopped up into haywire-synapse stammers, and tossed down into dubbed-out concrete bunkers so their voices can justify the mix's name.</p>
<p>And the further <i>Echo Party</i> goes along, the deeper it descends into full-blown chaos, since Edan doesn't just stop at manipulating the sounds that already existed on the wax he had to work with. Aside from pulling a few odd tweaks with tape manipulation and reverb, Edan layers over his own instrumentation-- self-aware sloppy guitars, wobbly drum machines, banks of diseased-sounding synthesizers-- and pours it on to the point where most of the mix's last half diverts from the old-school mix premise and turns into a disorienting, almost grotesque flare-up of distorted fuzz and horror. And yet it still keeps that b-boy pulse going steady-- somehow, against all laws of nature and physics, though you might have to strain to focus on it. You could put together some pretty fucking alarming uprock routines to this. (An aside: the melody to b-boy national anthem ""Apache"" does appear-- but, along with a brief interpolation of the Rolling Stones' ""Miss You""-- it comes via kazoo.)</p>
<p>Twenty-nine minutes does feel a bit short for a full-length-priced CD-- and ferchrissakes, get the CD, because the liner booklet that comes with it is a ridiculously elaborate typewritten transcript of every single thing that happens in the mix and it looks like some kind of rogue producer's shack-concocted manifesto. And this still isn't quite the official third full-length that people have been waiting for; Edan doesn't actually pick up the mic to rap on this thing (though he robotulates his voice near the end to thank you for listening). But if you've ever wanted to hear classic cuts from the dawn of hip hop turned into hallucinogenic setpieces that knock and clang like glitched-up King Tubby, <i>Echo Party</i> should justify whatever the hell it is Edan's been doing with his time over the past four years.</p></div>"|13720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13720-echo-party/|6.8|Nate Patrin

She was a guitarist in Ash from her late teens through her mid-twenties, toured as a bassist for Client, and spent half of 2009 traveling the world as a member of Bat for Lashes. For fans of her first two solo albums, the fact that she is not known for her own material is rather vexing, as there is nothing minor about it. Hatherley is a confident vocalist and a deceptively clever guitarist, and if she ever experienced growing pains as a songwriter, she certainly got it all out of her system before penning her debut record, <i>Grey Will Fade</i>. Though her songs synthesize familiar elements of British art-pop and 1990s alt-rock, her style is distinct and refreshingly out of step with most of her contemporaries. This is not a woman who ought to be a footnote.</p>
<p>Hatherley's third album, <i>New Worlds</i>, is her first to be formally released and promoted in the United States, and it is her most self-assured record to date. It's also the most lyrically focused, with nearly every track describing experiences and emotions in terms of color metaphors. Rather than attempt to evoke a state of synesthesia in the listener, Hatherley articulates a synesthetic point of view in her lyrics. The tell-don't-show approach is typically a misstep, but it makes perfect sense here, as the album's most thrilling bits come when she's excitedly explaining sensations and epiphanies that don't fully translate outside the boundaries of her imaginative mind. The point is not to totally grasp her crackpot color-coded cosmology, but instead to relate to the feeling of rediscovering the world and opening up to new possibilities. This is where she's all show-don't-tell: Even if her lyrics only scratch the surface of bold notions and personal revelations, the music nails the combination of urgency, fascination, and wonderment that often accompanies moments of profound inspiration. ""Full Circle"", ""Little Sahara"", and the title track are particularly effervescent and practically overflow with manic energy despite Hatherley's tight compositions and controlled performances. Gentler songs like ""Alexander"" and ""Cinnabar"" forsake gleeful intensity in favor of a pensive majesty that captures a similar sort of magic.</p>
<p>Hatherley is a meticulous artist, and her songs are carefully constructed things designed for a powerful dynamic impact without sacrificing elegance and grace. She's the best sort of craft-driven writer, consistently avoiding ostentatious displays of technical ingenuity while subtly exerting her skill in ways that call attention to, rather than distract from, her melodies. Hatherley's focused approach to writing carries over to her lyrical themes. ""Full Circle"", the album's hyperactive centerpiece, is all about getting oneself to reject passivity and embrace creative action, and sounds something like a response to Marnie Stern's self-directed pep talks from <i>This Is It and I Am It and You Are It and So Is That and He Is It and She Is It and It Is It and That Is That</i>. Other songs, such as the lead single, ""White"", are more concerned with attaining a focused awareness of the self within a physical environment, and acknowledging how color, texture, and other physical stimuli shape our emotional responses. In either case, Hatherley is concerned with honing perceptions and getting the most of out of life by keeping her mind clear and alert.</p>
<p>The primary tension, both musically and lyrically, on <i>New Worlds</i> is between disciplined focus and wild hair intuition. It's not a binary opposition, though, but instead a cycle that enables an artist to effectively communicate their ideas. Though Hatherley foregrounds the creative process in her lyrics at some points, she's never self-conscious or overly meta in addressing her process or her muse. The astonishing thing about the album is just how relaxed it all feels despite its mannered construction. The music never sounds improvised, but when the songs pop, the sensation is raw and immediate. Hatherley is not reinventing herself, much less rock music, but with <i>New Worlds</i>, she has refined her aesthetic and the result is an album that can draw comparisons to XTC, the Breeders, Wire, the Pretenders, and other top-shelf rock bands, but ultimately sounds like nothing else but the work of its creator. If there was ever a time for Charlotte Hatherley to finally enter the spotlight, this is it.</p></div>"|13746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13746-new-worlds/|8.0|Matthew Perpetua

Living in New York, he drank heavily and got jumped outside a bar, so he moved to San Francisco, where he continued to drink heavily. Finally he decided to sober up and remove himself from the society that wanted increasingly larger pieces of him, so he trekked out to Lawrence Ferlinghetti's cabin in the wilds of Big Sur, where he dried out in seclusion and tried to right himself. He also wrote a thinly veiled fictional account of his experiences-- about the big demons, like addiction and messing with his friend's mistress, but also about the simple pleasures of washing dishes and meeting donkeys in Bixby Canyon-- called <i>Big Sur,</i> which only furthered his celebrity.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Kerouac's sojourn to Big Sur is the subject of a new documentary by Curt Worden and a new album by Jay Farrar and Ben Gibbard, both of which are titled <i>One Fast Move or I'm Gone</i>. The doc is a fawning appreciation of one of the most romanticized writers of the 20th century, and it never lets the actual man obscure the accepted myth of troubled genius. Farrar actually appears in the movie, performing ""San Francisco"" while seated on the floor of a hotel room next to an unmade bed, and the scene plays like his version of rock-and-roll fantasy camp. Even so, he and Gibbard approach the album less as a soundtrack than as a kind of <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> project, constructing songs from snippets of Kerouac's prose and setting them to languid acoustic arrangements.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The album actually follows the novel somewhat faithfully, opening with Gibbard and Kerouac crossing America on the California Zephyr: ""I'm on the California Zephyr, watching America roll by,"" Gibbard sings painting Kerouac as the most matter-of-fact writer imaginable. In both the doc and the album, the Beat writer is more idea than individual, and he seems burdened with everything that his readers and fans project onto him. For Farrar, who wrote all but the title track on <i>One Fast Move</i>, Kerouac embodies certain notions of America and Americana that jibe with his post-Uncle Tupelo output; Kerouac is Woody Guthrie with a typewriter. Once upon a time, however, Farrar was a punk in suburban America who displayed no compunction about hammering out loud and fast arrangements of old country tunes. Over the ensuing 20 years, he's grown increasingly reverent and deferential toward his heroes, which (like the worshipfulness of the doc's talking heads) saps Kerouac of his countercultural menace. Worse, it makes for an album about as listenable as a graduate seminar paper. On most of these self-serious songs, Farrar brings his usual unwavering gravity, but only on ""Low Life Kingdom"" does he find a melody strong enough to highlight that burr of a voice. <span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For an album about a doc about a book about going into the wilds of California, <i>One Fast Move</i> sounds awfully sleepy. Taking a cue from Kerouac's spontaneous approach to writing, Farrar and Gibbard recorded the songs over a five-day period, with Earlimart's Aaron Espinoza at the helm. Trouble is, it sounds that way. Lacking the earnestness in folk-rock that comes so easily to him in indie pop, the Death Cab singer takes on Kerouac's words and Farrar's melodies, but he sounds ill-suited for the setting and so can't do much with<span> </span>""California Zephyr"" and ""Williamine"". Still, the title track, which is his only songwriting credit, captures some of the novel's antsy restlessness, drawing out the title as a low-key bluesy howl.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">What this album about the so-called King of the Beats lacks is, well, a beat. Gibbard plays drums on just a few tracks, but he just hangs back timidly, barely even keeping time. The songs remain sedentary rather than hitchhike, steal a car, run, or hop a freight. This particular disregard is unfortunate, especially since the documentary takes great pains to point out the rhythmic quality of Kerouac's prose, which splattered words across the page the way Pollock applied paint to canvas. As a result, you don't get much sense of how his words sound, what they do, or what they can mean. For that, skip both the album and the doc and just read the book.</p>

So the Bravery are just about the last quasi-big rock band anyone might expect to come within downtown sneering distance of a noteworthy hit by a bona fide pop starlet. But here we are: Sam Endicott, frontman for these oft-abused New York electro-rockers, co-wrote Shakira's Italo-crazed ""She Wolf"". He didn't, however, write the lyrics.</p>
<p>New Order-style bass lines like the one on ""She Wolf"" could practically be the story of this guy's career. They anchored the Killers-lite dance-rock of the Bravery's self-titled 2005 debut-- particularly its best song, ""Honest Mistake""-- and turned scarce when the band dialed back the synths for rootsier wannabe-Brit mope on disastrous 2007 follow-up, <i>The Sun and the Moon</i>. While that synth-pop bounce is back on <i>Stir the Blood</i>, so are the group's shortcomings. Some are familiar, and some are worse than even the most hardened mid-2000s <i>NME</i> skeptics could've anticipated.</p>
<p>Endicott's voice still alternates between operatic Ian Curtis croon (remember Elefant?) and adenoidal Robert Smith whine (remember Stellastarr*?). He still sings songs that manage to evoke greats from bygone eras without any of the greatness: ""Baby, we were born to be adored,"" repeats glumly hooky synth-rock opener ""Adored"", neatly desecrating the most famous choruses from Bruce Springsteen and the Stone Roses in a single refrain. ""Born again"" stomper ""Song for Jacob"" contains a sideways allusion to the Smiths' <i>Louder Than Bombs</i>, and make-out anthem of sorts ""She's So Bendable"" has that ""How Soon Is Now"" guitar wobble. Soma-dropping dystopia ""I Have Seen the Future""-- in which the band accurately concedes, ""I am a nerve ending without a brain""-- might as well be called ""I have become aware of the title and primary neologism from <i>Brave New World</i>."" Druggy (I guess?) finale ""Sugar Pill"" avers, ""I am blissed out/ I have kaleidoscope eyes.""
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
Shakira this isn't.</p>
<p>""She Wolf"" collaborator John Hill, who co-produced Santigold's excellent debut album, doesn't seem to have been much help sonically, either. Someone clinically extracts whatever trace of messy humanity made it through the first time the Bravery worked the nu-wave shtick, on their debut; <i>Stir the Blood</i> is a parodoxically bloodless listen. In another evolution of the band's sound, lead guitarist Michael ""Moose"" Zakarin now tops the cookie-cutter chord progressions with needlessly frilly prog-metal solos. See ""Hatefuck"", which gives the band's previous woman-unfriendly tendencies a shrill, witless apotheosis (""No one can hear you here""-- hey, wasn't that part of a David Spade <a href=""http://www.dead-frog.com/comedians/jokes/david_spade/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""dirtball-comedy routine"">dirtball-comedy routine</a>?). As if that weren't enough to get us all excited, there's utterly unremarkable first single ""Slow Poison"": ""Burn, burn, house on fire/ I'm so sick and tired."" It goes on like this.</p></div>"|13727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13727-stir-the-blood/|2.3|Marc Hogan

The track-- co-produced here by Rupture and Matt Shadetek and rechristened ""Get Hustlin""-- is a shot across the bow from the Guyana-born Brooklyn MC. That opening selection might be broadcasting intentions, suggesting this heavyweight hybrid is another the-music-world-is-flat spin on bass culture.</p>
<p><i>Buzzrock Warrior </i>doesn't reach that plateau, but it does due diligence, rattling with digital bass and opening the floor to showcase the headliner's vocal talents. Co-produced by Rupture and Shadetek with a roster of collaborators, the music here drives but doesn't dislodge the bassbin, mostly settling on sleek, polyglot rhythms, some of which have been floating around for months. ""Go Round Payola"", a Shadetek joint that originally came out last year, is a restless bit of fizzy, 8-bit energy. ""Let's Go"", by cumbia artist Chancha Via Circuito (Pedro Canale), rides jazzy cymbals and bass in a tight but shuffling rhythm. ""Earthshaking"", a dirty shuffle produced by Brazilian Maga Bo, drops plodding low end over the sound of sizzling electricity, and Modeselektor's ""Dem a Idiot"" fuses strings and depth-charge beats into a midtempo burner. <i>Buzzrock </i>is positveily laid-back compared to something like the Bug's <i>London Zoo.</i></p>
<p>Blakkamoore's delivery gets plenty of room to flex, pointing to a promising talent who can bridge margins and is at home with dancehall-style riffs, dub-friendly pronouncements, and sweet harmonies, vital in a free-flowing exchange of global rhythms. He doesn't fully rise to the occasion, however, delivering a dexterous but not truly memorable performance that favors delivery over content. Blakkamoore bounces between loose and languid duets (""Rise Again""), duels with gruff MCs and soulful material such as ""Come With Me"", where he recounts his immigration experience-- staying with family as his parents worked and saved for his trip, his first snow storm, and middle-of-the-night quizzes so his story would be straight for U.S. customs officials. But his voice occasionally gets saccharine. Fired-up lover's ode ""She Said"", with pace-setting bass riffs, burns out, and the slack groove of ""The General"" is tweaked too far with Auto-Tune. On ""Get Hustlin"", he smoothly lays down rote and unremarkable lyrics, and ""Mesmerized"", a muddle of world-in-peril lyrics, is redeemed by Blakkamoore's alternately sweet and gruff wordplay while trading off lines with grime MC Durrty Goodz.</p>
<p>Combining too many flavors can often dull the final results, and while this album is far from bland, it also lacks a compelling identity or strong message. A decent set of global grooves isn't bad, but Brooklyn internationalist Blakkamoore sounds poised to achieve more.</p></div>"|13665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13665-buzzrock-warrior/|6.8|Patrick Sisson

That's a reasonable expectation. The human voice is the oldest musical instrument, and the one that resonates most frequently with people. Instrumental rock attempts to supply that resonance with, well, instruments. This is a difficult task, given that no musical instrument is as expressive as the human voice.</p>
<p>Pelican have worked with these problems for most of this decade. Early efforts, a self-titled EP and the <i>Australasia</i> full-length, got by on power and a little atmosphere. At that time, the band sounded like a more expansive, drone-oriented Neurosis. Its riffs were dark, and its tones were thick. In that style of rock/metal, vocals are often screamed or growled, adding textural abrasion instead of functioning as a lyrical instrument. Thus, Pelican's lack of vocals wasn't noticeable, since their guitars more than compensated.</p>
<p>On 2005's <i>March Into the Sea</i> EP and <i>The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw</i> full-length, Pelican changed direction. They added light and shade, stretched compositions into multi-part opuses, and experimented with major keys and acoustic guitars. No longer could the band depend on sheer volume to replace vocals. Still, vocals weren't necessary. Once a song exceeds eight minutes in length, listeners' traditional expectations fall away.</p>
<p>Pelican's current conundrum began with 2007's <i>City of Echoes</i>. The band scaled back its songs to more conventional lengths but didn't change much otherwise, making them feel like strings of sometimes-cool riffs. But the group shored up its songwriting with the <i>Pink Mammoth</i> and <i>Ephemeral</i> EPs, and now the songs on <i>What We All Come to Need</i> flow smoothly. Their riffs work with each other instead of next to each other. Drummer Larry Herweg, once maligned for playing metal like an indie rock drummer, has tightened up his act, not only keeping steady time but also providing a pleasing propulsion. Pelican no longer sound like they're grappling with their identity.</p>
<p>However, the band is almost too comfortable with its vocal-less shtick. Now it's writing efficient, fat-free five- to seven-minute songs that, with a few edits, could end up on radio. And therein lies the problem: These songs feel like conventional rock songs, with short intros and verse-like sections. With moderate distortion and loping tempos, they sound like some long-lost Pearl Jam demos, owing much to 1990s alternative rock. Divest the Smashing Pumpkins or Hum of their singers, give the bands room to jam, and this album might have ensued. Without vocals, it feels slightly empty. The final track underscores this, as a guest singer lends a ghostly air to an Alice in Chains-esque dirge that begs for radio play. It turns out what we all come to need is vocals.</p></div>"|13670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13670-what-we-all-come-to-need/|5.5|Cosmo Lee

The song seems to be partly about the struggle of creation-- grazing on the imagination, maybe-- and then Noah Lennox (Panda Bear) comes in with his thick, honeyed voice to sing a bridge that seems a distant cousin of the Beach Boys' ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"". There's tension in this opening section; the words and music suggest a sticking point, something that needs to be punctured before the song (and ideas) can really flow. And then it happens, the break, but in an unexpected way: a peppy flute melody materializes and the rhythm becomes a kind of stomp that seems designed to inspire folk dancing, while Portner and Lennox pick up the tempo and start singing rounds: ""Why do you have to go?/ Why do you have to go?""</p>
<p>The first time through, hearing ""Graze"" explode into this weird sing-along RenFaire jig is a bit of a shock. It sounds very far from what we imagine a hip, frequently name-checked indie band with abrasive experimental roots to sound like. And their performance of it is certainly not tongue-in-cheek: They sound joyful, and they're not smirking. (I'm not sure they're capable of that particular expression, to be honest.) And thus it becomes clear that Animal Collective, despite having become a certain kind of alt touchstone in 2009, doesn't much care about conventional notions of cool. If they want to get dorky and put in a section that asks you to bust out the medieval garb and hop around on one leg for a minute, they'll do it. And maybe they'll put this song in the lead spot on an EP that follows up the biggest and most successful record of their career.  All this went through my mind before finding out, after reading <i>Fall Be Kind</i>'s credits, that the flute sample comes courtesy of an artist whose name became a punchline after an endless run of goofy TV spots advertising his music: Zamfir, the Master of the Pan Flute. Cool? These guys aren't sweating it.</p>
<p>Like their last three EPs of new material, <i>Fall Be Kind</i> exists in the orbit of the full-length that preceded it but it isn't defined by it. It's got songs written before and during the creation of <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>, but they're songs that didn't fit that record for one reason or another. Given its fragmented genesis, it's surprising how listenable and of-a-piece <i>Fall Be Kind</i> is. ""Graze"" flows directly into ""What Would I Want? Sky"", a song that samples Grateful Dead's ""Unbroken Chain"" and is easily among the most warm, likeable, and melodic tracks Animal Collective have recorded.  It refracts Aquarian optimism through a modern sense of uncertainty, undercutting the loop's jovial lilt with a tricky structure and lyrics that seem confused about what will happen next. ""Sky"" contains the first officially licensed sample of the Dead, and it's the best marketing move the band's organization has made since they greenlighted Cherry Garcia. It's not easy to take a cut-up voice and make it the centerpiece of a tune, and it's harder still to sing along with it in a way that doesn't sound forced. But ""What Would I Want? Sky"" sounds as natural as something that grew out of the earth.</p>
<p>The final three songs are more abstract and dreamy. ""Bleed"" feels like an interlude, something the band might have put on an album five years ago. It's a shifting drone, with Portner and Lennox's treated voices singing one simple refrain. It doesn't develop or do much, but it's not supposed to. Instead, it serves as a bridge to the EP's darker second half, which kicks off with ""On a Highway"". Something like the A.C. version of Bob Seger's ""Turn the Page"", ""On a Highway"" is a lonesome tour lament. Over a throbbing, dubby background, which is punctuated by thwacks of hand drums that slowly rise in the mix, Portner offers a series of scenes glimpsed out the window of a van, and he gets unusually personal, even referencing his bandmate directly (""Sick of too much reading/ Jealous of Noah's dreaming/ Can't help my brain from thinking""). Lennox's closing ""I Think I Can"" is the one song here that takes a few listens to sink in. It's longer (a touch over seven minutes), with busier production (sequenced piano notes, synth pulses, percussion, and voices flying back and forth between the speakers) and a more circular melody, but the final two minutes provide a terrific payoff to the opening clatter, with Lennox repeating the title's affirmation in a quick descending pattern as the song finally opens up.</p>
<p>At 27 minutes, <i>Fall Be Kind</i> is short enough to invite another play once ""I Think I Can"" fades out, which means a return to that striking second half of ""Graze"". When a band tries something that shouldn't work and brings it off, it's a sign of confidence. Animal Collective's focus and general disinterest in looking over their shoulders obviously makes what they're doing that much more appealing. But the most interesting thing about them at this point may be that, despite all the great music they've been making the past few years, it's not hard to imagine them failing. They've honed their craft and become very good at what they do, but there still seems to be a desire to go to unfamiliar realms, and it's possible that wherever they head next will turn out to be place they don't inhabit as easily. There's still a sense of gamble with Animal Collective, nothing is fixed-- and that's exactly what makes them an especially exciting band.</p></div>"|13739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13739-fall-be-kind-ep/|8.9|Mark Richardson

It's a relatively thin jingle with which to declare  oneself king of the hill, but then today's New York is not what it was. Once  upon a time, claiming the metaphysical mayoralty of Manhattan was something  akin to becoming Heavyweight Champion of the World (back when <i>that</i> meant something). Ever since some  pie-eyed Long Island dreamer declared himself ""Walt Whitman, a cosmos,  of Manhattan the son,"" the keenest, hungriest, most desperate sons  and daughters have slugged it out to make the island their own. Norman  Mailer typically took things literally and actually ran for mayor. But  the battles for the city ring out like classic 12-rounders: Benny Goodman vs. Artie Shaw. John Coltrane vs. Charlie Parker. Andy Warhol vs. Bob Dylan. Robert De Niro vs. Al Pacino...</p>
<p>With barely a contender to speak of,  Jay has taken the title almost by default. But now, like a sleeping  giant roused by the sound of his name being taken in vain (""I'm  the new Sinatra/ Since I made it here/ I can make it anywhere""),  the Chairman of the Board has risen from the grave, with a hulking 5xCD-disc  box set called simply <i>New York</i>,  as though part of some posthumous  attempt to be declared boss of the joint in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Never mind that he was a Hoboken boy  who left for L.A. and Nevada as soon as Hollywood and the casinos called.  As this lavish package-- complete with supporting quotes from Martin Scorsese,  Nat Hentoff, Yogi Berra, Twyla Tharp, and William Friedkin-- would have you believe, New York was the capital of the 20th Century, and Sinatra was its  voice.</p>
<p>Not that actual music on these discs  would go very far in making the case. Compiling six previously unreleased  New York shows from 1955 through to 1990, on the face of it these recordings  tell a sorry tale of grand decline.</p>
<p>The 1955 set is a surprise appearance  at a 20th-anniversary celebration for Tommy Dorsey, in whose  band the young Sinatra first made his name. ""You know, there was a time about 50 years ago when I would  have said you GOTTA sing,"" laughs Dorsey, inviting his ex-front man  up on stage. Dorsey was famously, reputedly,  the original guy to receive an offer he couldn't refuse, as Sinatra  attempted to extricate himself from Dorsey's 33% of lifetime earnings  contract in the early 40s. But there seems to be no bad blood: Sinatra  is gracious, crooning respectfully through old Dorsey numbers like ""I'll  Never Smile Again"", introducing a lovely Dorsey solo with the gracious  ""you're on, Thomas,"" and only briefly forgetting the words on  ""Oh! Look At Me Now"".</p>
<p>Things are sloppier on the set from  1963, playing a staff event at the United Nations. Backed solely by  the campy vamping of pianist Skitch Henderson (""We rehearsed  for exactly one and a half minutes tonight,"" he cracks), Sinatra is awful-- forgetting  words, insulting a stagehand who addresses him as ""monsieur,"" generally  losing the plot. ""We've all had a lot of problems these last few  years,"" he drawls to the UN staff. ""Vietnam, the Congo, Lake Tahoe...  [Referring to his doomed Cal-Neva resort] Anyone wanna buy a used casino?""</p>
<p>The 1974 sets, recorded in the wake  of the successful return-from-retirement TV special and LP <i>Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back</i>, are  more rewarding. In the first, recorded at a Variety Club benefit at  Carnegie Hall (complete with mawkish tribute to the wonderful work of  the charity), his impatience with some of the crowd favorites, particularly  ""My Way"" is evident. But in the saloon singer heart of the show-- a medley of ""Last Night When We Were Young"", ""Violets for Your  Furs"", and ""Here's That Rainy Day""-- Sinatra is indomitable.</p>
<p>The second show from 1974, the renowned  ""Main Event"" recorded at  Madison Square Garden in a stage  mocked up as a boxing ring, is better still. Most notable is ""The  House I Live In"" originally recorded for a 1945 10-minute movie pleading  for racial tolerance, now revived as a hymn of post-Nixon national healing.  (He was later to sing it for his pals at the 1985 Reagan inauguration).  There's also a hushed, awestruck ""Send in the Clowns""  which makes  you wonder what later Sinatra might have been like if he'd chosen  to record more songs by Stephen Sondheim, and fewer  by David Gates  or Joe  Raposo.</p>
<p>Though he starts off snarling at the  thought of Marlon Brando singing ""Luck Be a Lady"" in the film of  <i>Guys and Dolls</i>, the 1984 set, recorded back at Carnegie Hall, finds  Sinatra almost mellowing. The shows are dedicated to the memory of Count  Basie,  Don Costa (arranger of <i>Sinatra and Strings</i>), and, particularly, Gordon Jenkins (arranger of the starkest moments of Sinatra misery,  including <i>Where Are You?</i> and <i>No One Cares</i>)-- whose work is celebrated  with a stunning ""This Is All I Ask"".</p>
<p>The 1990 show, recorded at Radio City,  finds Sinatra grouchily insisting, ""I hated and still hate this song,""  as he introduces ""Strangers in the Night"", but gradually being won  over by a crowd clearly in love with him. By the end, with a triumphant  homecoming ""Theme From New York, New York"" somehow overcoming the  limitations of his creaking voice, the cool has dropped and he's declaring,  ""You're the most exciting audience I ever played to, I swear!"".</p>
<p>If you wanted to make a real case for  Sinatra as the voice of New York's urban anomie, gangster charm, and  existential romance you'd need to compile a far different  box: It might start with the shriek that greeted Sinatra's 1942 debut at  the Paramount. It would include field recordings of the sounds of the  1944 Columbus Day Riot, when 35,000 girls tried to get into the same  venue. There'd be the 1961 Carnegie Hall benefit show for Martin Luther  King, Jr. And then the 1978 Radio City set where he debuted ""New York,  New York""...</p>
<p>Until that anthology, the incredible run of Capitol albums  from 1955's <i>In the Wee Small Hours</i> to 1959's <i>No One Cares</i>, will have to do. Because, though  recorded in the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood, Los Angeles,  these songs remain the most  vivid documents of that old New York  state of mind this side of <i>The Great Gatsby</i>.</p></div>"|13733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13733-new-york/|6.1|Stephen Troussé

Now, I'm certain nominal frontwoman Clare Manchon, her husband and prime collaborator Olivier, and the rest of the band's contributors would claim a wealth of other influences, particularly classic makers of cosmopolitan pop standards and cool orchestral platters, who've lent the group's sophomore album, <i>Arrow</i>, its air of sophisticated frothiness. Yet it doesn't change the fact that overt Beatles simulacrums are all over this record, to the point where it begins to pull your attention away from any recognition of Clare and the Reasons' charms-- though perhaps those charms aren't quite pronounced enough in the first place to convincingly outweigh games of spot-that-soundalike.</p>
<p>The Manchons learned melody well at the feet of Lennon-McCartney and the couple's other masters, as <i>Arrow</i> comes equipped with an estimable measure of charming refrains that linger with you long after the album, particularly the delicately wounded ""Ooh You Hurt Me So"", the buoyant ""You Getting Me"", and the swooningly swinging ""This Is the Story"". Unfortunately, these lightly agreeable tunes are ornamented by music that's even more unobtrusive. St. Vincent has lately demonstrated that you can construct a compelling aesthetic by juxtaposing highly mannered vocalisms with arty, unpredictable sonic fare, but Clare and the Reasons refuse to stretch beyond polite listenability in any arena. It's hard to encounter these songs and not daydream about how a little dissonance and unpredictability could add a wealth of tension and gratification to the proceedings. Instead, we get modestly friendly string-and-horn arrangements, and, if the band's feeling especially frisky, perhaps a bit of mildly burbling synth (""You Got Time"", ""Perdue a Paris"").</p>
<p>And we get lots and lots of stuff that sounds like the Beatles-- the solitary pealing guitar blurts of ""Ooh You Hurt Me So"", ""This Is the Story"", and ""Kyoto Nights"", the ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" bass of ""Murder, They Want Murder""-- even the horns on the band's superfluous cover of Genesis' ""That's All"" hearken back to <i>Revolver</i> and <i>Sgt. Pepper'</i><i>s</i> far more than anything from the Phil Collins playbook. The moptop mimesis reaches its boiling point on ""Photograph"", which manages in its two and a half minutes to evoke ""She's Leaving Home"", ""Eleanor Rigby"", and side two of <i>Abbey Road</i> (it also conjures up ""Paint It, Black"", so perhaps we should be on the lookout for Stones hagiography next time around). When the Beatles first made these sounds the effect was revolutionary-- reproducing them 40 years after the fact is, at best, a charming dead end.</p></div>"|13715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13715-arrow/|5.1|Joshua Love

Were that true, one of the last things we should be spending our time with in the final days of 2009 is the second record from a spazzy, lo-fi electro-funk band from Montreal. But to their credit, Think About Life's sophomore album doesn't feel passé-- even if the best qualities on <i>Family</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> have already been used on better records. Melding the four-on-the-floor funk and falsetto of their neighbors in Chromeo, the chaotic, catchy samples of the Go! Team, the eight-bit blips of Crystal Castles, and the soulful vocals of TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, the raucous, lightweight songs of Think About Life feel like they were designed in a lab to get indie kids dancing. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Family</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is, however, the definition of front-loaded. Its three best songs-- ""Johanna"", ""Havin' My Baby"", and ""Sweet Sixteen""-- kick off the album, which then spends the rest of its runtime trying to reach the blissful highs of its opening trifecta. Thanks to a fixation with both radio-ready hip-hop and weirdo synth-punk, Miracle Fortress' Graham Van Pelt (the band's producer, keyboardist, and primary sound architect) gives Think About Life an adaptable aesthetic that is equal parts rococo hedonism and arty affectation. To wit, ""Johanna"" kicks off with an incongruously groovy flute sample before giving into the rhythmic horns and funky guitars that could be a bed for a Kanye single; ""Havin' My Baby"" is built on a sped-up sugar-rush hook repeated so insistently that we dare you to get it out of your head; and ""Sweet Sixteen"" builds a sexy, deadpan groove worthy of James Murphy out of videogame bleeps and a steady, sparse beat.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As proved by the album's opening songs, Think About Life are at their best when they are playing fast. The furious energy of their buzzing synthesizers and throbbing<span style=""font-style: normal;""> basslines are often enough to make up for some of the more uninspired melodies or overly repetitive sections (especially given that they have washed off much of the noisy grime of their debut). But that is not to say that the album's slower moments are all duds. ""The Veldt"" is built on a plucky, almost dubby guitar melody and prominently features an ascending melody (with appropriately reflective lyrics) ripped from the Temptations' ""My Girl"". And the juxtaposition of the band's most synthetic impulses (the skittering, interrupted dance beat, the glossy, almost Italo disco synths, the chirpy vocal sample) against Martin Cesar's most world-weary, emotive vocals on ""Nueva Nueva"" is disarmingly tender. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With its sloppy, homemade charm and riotous dancefloor impulses, <i>Family</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is easy to like, but in an era of likeminded indie dance dabblers, equally easy to forget. Songs like ""Havin' My Baby"" are so winningly infectious that they will buy the band some time on the cultural radar. But as an album, </span><i>Family</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> feels a bit like the last gasp of an era.</span></p>

Flecks of heavy stoner fuzz and wafts of breezy modern rock blow in and out of <i>Spells</i>, but at its core, it's a ripper. Most of the credit goes to Sarah Negahdari; she's a powerful but economical guitarist, jutting in and out of the tracks like a jagged saw. And her voice, while thin at times, commands attention on both the stompers and the serenades; she's equally adept at twisting around the pile of power chords that is ""Silver"" as the unsettling buzz and hum of ""Turtle and Hare"". With all the right angles and sharp left turns underpinning Negahdari's acrobatic vocals, <i>Spells</i> can feel downright Deerhoofy at times, and while <i>Spells</i> goes glam and grunge where Deerhoof would opt for space and skronk, there's a feeling that this music could literally go anywhere-- and that Negahdari could figure out something to sing over it no matter where it might roam.</p>
<p>This isn't to say Negahdari's bandmates, drummer Chris Hernandez and bassist and occasional vocalist Charlie Mahoney aren't worthwhile; with somebody like this in the lead role, though, they were bound to pale in comparison. Mahoney's time behind the mic is would've been best left on the cutting room floor; his two tunes, ""DeLorean"" and ""A Man, A Plan, A Canal"" are bogged down by lyrics best described as dumbassed, and despite a tumescent chorus on ""DeLorean"" and a Pavlovian Les Savy Fav thing on ""A Man"", keeping Negahdari front and center seems in everyone's best interest.</p>
<p>Great as Negahdari is in the moment, the Hollows songs can feel a bit piecemeal in their composition, and they don't have too many tunes memorable enough to stick with you all the way through its many twists and turns. The cracking <i>Whip-Smart</i>-indebted lead single ""Death to Vivek Kemp"" gets pretty close, but it's the lone
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
exception; it is the single, after all. At 50 minutes of occasional mania and infrequent tranquility, <i>Spells</i> can seem a little much  to take in straight through; it's eclecticism does occasionally feel jumpy, but the easiest fix would be to excise the numbers Mahoney sings and just let Negahdari hog the spotlight she so clearly deserves. As good an introduction to Negahdari's obvious and still-burgeoning talents as <i>Spells</i> is, it gives the impression her best is yet to come.</p></div>"|13724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13724-spells/|7.2|Paul Thompson

But listening to Jawbox's freshly reissued 1994 major-label debut, <i>For Your Own Special Sweetheart</i>, it's difficult to conclude they made the wrong decision by recording this album for Atlantic. The obvious reason is cold, hard cash: <i>Sweetheart</i> might sound unassumingly direct, but it takes a lot of time and money to make a record this precise and balanced. The other reason is more nebulous, but no less relevant: You don't jump ship from a dogmatically anti-major label like Dischord to a behemoth like Atlantic without understanding that the next thing you do had better be really, really good. While a more naïve band might have diluted its sound to seek fame and fortune, Jawbox cashed in the chips on their shoulders and made their most uncompromising and ferocious record.</p>
<p><span><i>Sweetheart</i>'s return to Dischord reintroduces the album as a win-win prospect: a record with a mid-90s alt-rock budget, but none of that era's corny or diminishing relics. </span>Bob Weston's thoughtful remaster retains the dynamic range of the original while breathing new life into its low end; Zach Barocas' kick drum finally feels like a punch in the chest. The essential B-sides from the <i>Savory</i> EP are included as well. Even the cover art has been revised, the dated sepia toned blow-up doll image of the original replaced by a solidly cast marble figure rendered in high-contrast grayscale.</p>
<p>The new cover is apt; <i>FYOSS</i> is downright sculptural in its attention to form and structure. The brilliance of <i>FYOSS</i> lies not in any one melody, guitar line, or drum fill but rather in the interaction between these elements. Every song is a thoughtfully interrelated system, an organic economy of sound, rhythm, and gesture. At times, once-distant guitar parts come together with such effortless strength that you can visualize guitarists J. Robbins and Bill Barbot bending the necks of their instruments in unison. Ted Nicely's impeccable production lends a subtle sheen to the album's pop sensibility but never dulls its harsh edges, revealing a band that is well-versed in both harmony and discord (no pun intended).</p>
<p>At its best, <i>FYOSS</i> compresses the energy of hardcore into something more nuanced and deliberate. ""Savory"" is a masterfully constructed study in tension and release, as Robbins' simple vocal melody is made infinitely more potent by layers of dissonant guitar chords, sparse bass, and violent, propulsive drumming. Even the song's angelic chorus seems subtly unresolved and menacing, though Robbins' and Barbot's guitars chime rather than stab. The guitar ""solo"" consists of little more than occasional muted feedback bursts, instead serving to emphasize the monolithic force of the band's rhythm section in the absence of Robbins' vocals. The J.G. Ballard-inspired ""Motorist"" narrates a car crash as metallic guitars jut out from a spare, skeletal frame. ""Cruel Swing"" sounds exactly like you'd think, Barocas absolutely pummeling his kit over a walking bass figure that sounds like it's challenging you to a fight. Album closer ""Whitney Walks"" contorts the limitations of Robbins' vocal range into a uniquely seething, uneasy kind of melancholy that perfectly prefigures the song's explosive finale.</p>
<p><span>The highlight of this reissue of <i>Sweetheart</i>, however, may very well be <i>Savory</i> B-side ""68"". For an odd-time-signature rock song, ""68"" is disarmingly elegant, to the point where you barely even notice that it's chugging along in 7/4. Here, you can understand why the Dismemberment Plan were quick to cite Jawbox as an influence: The improbable chord changes and impossible rhythmic ideas on <i>FYOSS</i> are rendered as seamless and intuitive as possible. Though the playing here is solid throughout, nothing about the record is flashy or unattainable-- restraint and discipline consistently best self-aware complexity.</span></p>
<p>While <i>FYOSS</i> itself doesn't sound dated, the notion that plainly recorded guitar, bass, drums, and vocals can add up to something extraordinary sometimes does. The onslaught of radio-friendly ""alternative"" bands that followed Jawbox has left us understandably wary of well-produced, punk-informed rock music with no obvious quirks or departures. But <i>FYOSS</i> has aged well precisely because it did not pander to the aesthetic fads of its time-- mainstream or underground. Instead, Jawbox honed their sound, maximized the resources at their disposal, and made a record that hides behind no extraneous instruments, sounds, or ideologies.</p></div>"|13732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13732-for-your-own-special-sweetheart/|9.3|Matt LeMay

The Gainesville, Fla.-based band's first two albums were lumped in with the indie Americana crowd, thanks as much to their rustic instrumentations as to singer John Orth's 2002 collaboration with Isaac Brock. But a few years and a label change later, now they seem a band apart, loners entrenched in no particular scene but their own. Even the recognizable elements on their third album, <i>Oh, Glory. Oh, Wilderness.</i>, sound slightly askew. The warble in Orth's voice, more pronounced here, is too high-pitched to ever be mistaken for Conor Oberst; the drawling pedal steel is more mood-setting than alt-countrifying; and the band arrive at insinuating hooks not with pop GPS, but with the patient wanderlust to know that each song will coalesce into something expressive and affecting.</p>
<p>Holopaw's indieward progression from Sub Pop in one corner of the country to Bakery Outlet in the other only reasserts their peculiarities and idiosyncrasies, and if <i>Oh, Glory</i> isn't their most immediately commanding album, it's most definitely their Holopaw-est-- and a grower to boot, relinquishing a few more mysteries with each listen. Gone are the grafted-on electronica elements of their self-titled 2003 debut and the shambling settings of their 2005 follow-up, <i>Quit+/or Fight</i>. Instead, the band has developed a livelier sound that fluctuates between the looseness of Pavement and the melodic focus of Death Cab. The change in sound mirrors a change in line-up: Following <i>Quit</i>, most of the band members split, leaving core duo Orth and Jeff Hays to carry on. They rounded out Holopaw with a new rhythm section that moves these songs along at a more rambunctious pace, a new guitarist who doodles curlicues all over the songs, and a cellist who adds sweeping undercurrents to Orth's melodies.</p>
<p><i>Oh, Glory</i> tries to take in every style of music from Seattle to Gainesville, although Holopaw aren't merely shuffling through geographical traditions. They take many different avenues and incorporate many different styles, but nothing leads them too far from a unified sound. Horns form the bedrock of ""Little Stallion With a Glass Jaw"" and ""Oh, Glory"", suggesting neither Memphis nor New Orleans; with their fades, crescendos, and fanfares, they're more akin to Athens' Elephant 6 bands. Rangey guitars spike ""The Lazy Matador"", but it's the fluttering of Jody Bilinski's cymbal trill that drives the song to its measured finale. The band members bark out encouragement on ""P-a-l-o-m-i-n-e"" and ""Black Lacquered Shame"", their voices propelling the songs as forcefully as the rhythm section.</p>
<p>Compared to the newfound breadth of Holopaw's sound, Orth's lyrics remain often startlingly specific, striving for a soft-spoken poetry that reads on the page as well as it sounds aloud. His imagery is striking and crisp. On ""The Lazy Matador"", he recalls a lover who smells ""like changing rooms, unbridled afternoons and horseplay and towel-whips and bathing suits rolled down off sunless hips."" On ""The Art Teacher and the Little Stallion"" a teacher inspires a crush when he tucks in a student's shirt and smoothes his hair for a visit to the Met.</p>
<p>At times these songs approach Decemberistic levels of self-conscious erudition, but Orth is more restrained and less storybookish than Colin Meloy. <i>Oh, Glory</i> is motivated by desires thwarted and passions unrequited, and Orth's practiced quaver conveys an appropriate urgency and renders these songs as breathless inner monologues. For many listeners, his mannered delivery may prove as off-putting as Oberst's own vibrato, but for these songs, it sounds fittingly evocative, as if only he could sing them. In fact, no other band but Holopaw could have dreamed up this album.</p></div>"|13714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13714-oh-glory-oh-wilderness/|8.1|Stephen M. Deusner

This is the sort of insane statement you tend to come across either in a composition student's doctoral thesis or in an interview with a musician who has been awake for 108 straight hours on speed, and, considering the album's title, it had me braced for the kind of project that would make Common's <i>Electric Circus</i> look grounded. I wasn't sure whether to feel surprised, disappointed, or relieved, then, when I discovered that <i>Escape 2 Mars</i> sounds more or less exactly like a Blackalicious album.</p>
<p>Whether or not you think this is a good thing probably depends entirely on your residual affection for early-2000s Blackalicious records like <i>Nia</i> and <i>Blazing Arrow</i>. The sonic template is basically the same, with beats split evenly between the sort of moderately bumping soul/funk tracks designed to politely rattle your Prius trunk and languorous, vaguely dubby ""space funk"" explorations. Gift of Gab, still a technically astounding but painfully limited rapper, comes off far better on the former than on the latter. When he is called upon to shower you with goofy, hyperspeed tongue-twisters, he remains pleasant company: On ""El Gifto Magnifico"", he packs his syllables so tightly that the yammering verses spring out like paper snakes from a novelty peanuts can. Don't slow down to examine the lines, though, or you might notice that he is calling himself  ""a black nerd thug showin' you the total strength of what a word does.""</p>
<p>Blackalicious were always nerdy, of course, but at least they used to be nerds trying out weird, audacious shit like the wild dragons-and-swords fantasy of <i>Nia</i>'s ""Cliff Hanger"" or the insane tempo-switching lyrical workout ""Chemical Calisthenics"". <i>Escape 2 Mars</i>, sadly, doesn't contain any surprises. Instead, there's your sermonizing money-isn't-everything cautionary tale (called, yup, ""Richman, Poorman""); there's the save-the-environment ""Electric Waterfalls"", which rails against ""technology and cell phones"" in an uncomfortably Matisyahu-level Jamaican patois. And, of course, there's the ""all-rap-sounds-the-same-now"" rant: ""Mini-me clone MCs talk, but they all are sayin'/ The exact same things, the exact same themes and hooks the exact same way,"" Gab gripes on ""Rhyme Travel"", a not-untrue observation that would nonetheless carry more bite if Gab himself had varied his subject matter even once in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>There is another moment in ""Rhyme Travel"" where Gab talks about testing out new cadences-- ""let me see how it sounds when I rap <i>this</i> way!"" he cries-- and it's illuminating. As a rapper, Gab is pretty much all cadence, a flow tinkerer so caught up in devising new rhyme schemes that he forgets to listen to what he's actually saying. He gets in his own way time and again here; on ""Dreamin'"", he flounders over a stuttering, malfunctioning-robot delivery while both Del Tha Funkee Homosapien and Brother Ali lap him easily by trying half as hard. Worse, once you extricate his words from the horkheimered contraptions he has ensnared them in, you are usually left with lines limper than day-old pasta. Would that he actually pen the misbegotten freakazoid space-travel opus I was fearing; at least that would have taken him someplace unexpected. As it stands, Gift of Gab don't seem likely to escape the gilded cage of the Okayplayer ghetto any time soon.</p></div>"|13730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13730-escape-2-mars/|5.4|Jayson Greene

NNCK don't just improvise, they don't even discuss what they're going to play, traversing many styles and moods with no safety net save the one that emerges from their collective creativity. Compared to NNCK's free-form tightrope-walk, Shuford's side project D. Charles Speer and the Helix can sound downright risk-averse. A straight-up roots-rock band, the Helix deal in moves that any fan of alt-country has memorized: twangy guitars, swinging piano chords, honky-tonk beats, tear-in-beer ballads. <i>Distillation</i>, the group's second studio album, is its most unapologetically traditional, full of 10 well-worn songs that rarely stray far from the patterns set by each opening bar.</p>
<p>And yet, just as NNCK's seemingly random improvisations coalesce into unforeseen peaks, the Helix offer quite a few surprises lurking below the familiar surface of <i>Distillation</i>. One of them is actually right there on top-- Shuford's low, creaking voice, an impressively emotive tool that makes otherwise plain lines sound wistful, wry, even creepy. ""But in the end, everything works out fine,"" he sings in opening road-poem ""Mason Dixon Crime"", instilling the words with knowing irony. On the slow, stoic ""Open Season"", his bellow makes consolations like ""If it seems there's no way out/ At least you've earned some clout/ By tying up loose ends"" sound more resigned than resolved, suggesting that even simple goals like closure are ultimately mixed blessings.</p>
<p>As <i>Distillation</i> progresses, the songs slowly grow stranger, and stretch out into looser, more open territory. On the intoxicating swinger ""Life Insurance"", pianist Hans Chew spins a comic yarn about the trials and tribulations of making all your appointments on time, even if your doctor ""just makes it worse"" and ""drives a beautiful hearse."" The heavier ""Gravedigger"" is even weirder, a melange of odd imagery set against rising music that feels like a classic-rock epic, filled with Chew's pounding keys, Marc Orleans' ripping guitar solos, and passages of wistful, ""Layla""-like sway. Interestingly, the album's most far-out tune, ""The Fallika Stair"", does away with words altogether, carving a path from Russian-sounding waltz to star-seeking guitar jam.</p>
<p>Throughout these well-crafted songs, shades of proven trad-rock tweakers seep through, from the mature lilt of Wilco to the proggy curves of Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, back to the ethno-ripping stomps of Camper Van Beethoven and even the stoned lurch of the Grateful Dead's most rural moments. But the closest parallel to the Helix's smokey croon is the drunken balladry of North Carolina's Spider Bags. Play that group's excellent <i>Goodbye Cruel World, Hello Crueler World </i>back-to-back with <i>Distillation </i>whenever you want to wash away any fears of alt-country's demise.</p>

He served a few months in prison. After his release, he found a job, got married, and raised a family. But before he went to jail, Higgins made the album <i>Red Hash</i> on a shoestring budget during a 40-hour marathon recording session. Over the next three decades, the self-released LP spread through bootleg iterations. Finally, in 2005, Six Organs of Admittance Ben Chasny wrote, ""If anyone has any information on the whereabouts or fate of Gary Higgins, please contact us at Drag City,"" in the liner notes of <i>School of the Flower</i>, on which he'd covered <i>Red Hash</i>'s masterpiece, ""Thicker Than a Smokey"". By that time, Zach Cowie, the Sub Pop A&amp;R guy who signed Chasny's other outfit, Comets on Fire, was leading a one-man letter-writing campaign to find Higgins. He sent the right letter to the right address. Higgins responded. Drag City re-released <i>Red Hash</i>, and Higgins began playing occasional live shows with many of the musicians that had played on the record. He, of course, made a comeback record.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <i>Seconds</i>, Higgins' first album in 36 years, doesn't match the vitality of its backstory. In a 2005 interview for <i>Splendid</i>, writer Jennifer Kelly asked Higgins about his influences when <i>Red Hash</i> was put to tape. After he started explaining David Crosby's guitar tunings, she asked about his interest in non-Western music, ostensibly seeking the roots for the freak in his folk. ""When the Beatles went towards the Indian influence and the tabla and the sitar, everybody became somewhat into that,"" he answered in much the same way you might expect of your parents or your uncle and aunt.</p>
<p>And that's how <i>Seconds</i> feels, too: avuncular and kind, experienced and maybe a tad bitter-- like a CD Baby adult-folk offering by someone with a sketchbook of songs, some friends who like to ""jam,"" and a new copy of Garage Band. While <i>Red Hash</i> was a collection of wonderfully refracted folk-rock that seemed just out of focus, <i>Seconds</i> errs on the side of the straightforward and sharp. ""When I Was Young"", Higgins' testimonial to music's tonic power, works mostly to remind how immediate the songs and singing of Jackson Browne and Tom Petty could be. ""Demons"", meanwhile, is an overly calm three-verse reflection on a debauched friend whose riches lead him to ruins. It begins with a duet for badly recorded acoustic guitars and eventually makes way for a harpsichord solo. And ""Ten-Speed"", a laborious seven-minute listen, suffers in the worst ways-- schlocky synthesizers, slogging electric bass, thick-string acoustic solos, end rhymes you can predict a few seconds out. ""She came to me in a hand stand/ She wiped my tears with her own hand,"" it goes. ""Then I wanted to fly/ Then I wanted to cry.""</p>
<p><i>Seconds</i> isn't a total loss, though. Higgins works best here when he sidesteps the grown-man folk blues trope, either by breaking stride sonically or by taking a playful turn on a somber subject. ""Little Squirrel"" does both, floating Higgins' wise baritone over a synthesizer daydream. With no guitar to chase, Higgins relaxes to ease out a tender observational parable about a squirrel killed by a dump truck. Sure, it's a tad pedestrian, but the concern in his voice and the reflective textures beneath afford gravity to lines like, ""Mama is high in the treetop/ Daddy is chasing a new nut/ Who'll be the one that will tell them what he's done?"" The 12-minute ""5 A.M. Trilogy"" hints at both Dylan and the Dead-- the former with its juxtaposition of two unrelated stories that, in the end, make each other strong, and the latter for the intertwining acoustic guitar lines that move from sunny consonance to brooding dissonance.</p>
<p>Higgins begins ""Mr. Blew"", another droopy mid-album blues rock number, with a bit of spoken-word encouragement: ""Now there's just one thing I want everybody to know: It just doesn't fucking matter. And if there was one lesson out of this song, that would be it. Yeah, that's right."" In the end, that's the lesson of Higgins' story and this album, at least as it relates to any dismissive review like this. Even if these songs and their performances are lackluster, the tragedies of their characters-- the dead squirrel, the selfish ""Mr. Blew"", the mother mourning her soldier son on ""5 A.M. Trilogy""-- and Higgins' overarching insistence that the world will keep turning are poignant. After all, before Higgins went to jail in 1973, he spent 40 hours with many of the people who play on <i>Seconds</i>, recording<i> Red Hash</i>, the strange curio that, decades later, lent him a cult legacy. Essentially, he gave the last bits of his freedom to music before heading to prison and, then, into private life. That he was able to make another record at all-- let alone one with the support of an institution like Drag City-- says more about the possibilities of resolve and redemption than I'd ever care to say about the failure of these songs.</p></div>"|13712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13712-seconds/|3.2|Grayson Currin

Almost immediately after releasing his debut, <i>Closing Time</i>, in 1973, Waits began shaking up his act and developing the oddball facets of his current persona: the hipster Beat delivery, the fascination with prowlers of back alleys and underbellies, the appreciation for jazz and blues and other American idioms, and the unmistakable voice that has grown stranger and more thunderous with each album. By the 1980s, the transformation was complete, although albums like <i>swordfishtrombones</i> and <i>Rain Dogs</i> were gambits, alienating as many fans as they attracted. In the 2000s and likely in the 2010s, few of his peers have proven so durable, so unique, so successful.</p>
<p>His music no longer begins and ends with an acoustic guitar and a piano, but his foundational commitment to these instruments has kept his musical excursions anchored to a songcraft that favors strict structures and bold melodies. Critically speaking, Waits-- aided and abetted by wife and musical partner, Kathleen Brennan-- is a tinkerer, assembling musical contraptions out of various styles and traditions and synthesizing blues, rock, jazz, schmaltz balladry, and even hip-hop into a truly idiosyncratic art. But I seriously doubt anyone bought tickets for his Glitter and Doom Tour last year because of his relationship to American blues. Instead, they went to see Waits the showman's showman, who regales them with tall tales of hopeless city dwellers and heartbroken hucksters with a campfire intimacy that makes these otherworldly denizens feel very real. He comes across as a scourge of the past, an affront to the modern world of blogs, bailouts, and reality TV.</p>
<p>His reluctance to tour regularly made Glitter and Doom one of the most coveted tickets of 2008. For those (of us) who missed it, we have <i>Glitter and Doom Live</i>, an album that reconstructs a typical evening with Waits (even though the tracks were recorded at different stops along the tour). While his nightly set lists generally covered every phase of his career, going back as far as ""Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis"" from 1978's <i>Blue Valentine</i>, this live album culls primarily from his 90s and 00s output, including several tracks rescued on 2006's <i>Orphans</i>. There are few nods to the 1970s and 80s, as if he's trying to avoid any overlap with his previous live album, 1988's <i>Big Time</i>. <i>Glitter and Doom Live</i> is not simply a souvenir of a tour most fans didn't attend but a<i> de facto </i>greatest hits of Waits' fourth decade of music, during which his gnarly adventurousness didn't wane but only intensified.</p>
<p>Waits leads a small but versatile band that makes these songs swing, playing up the tension without overwhelming his melodies. Omar Torrez's guitar snakes around Waits' vocals sinisterly, punctuating ""Goin' Out West"" with spiky notes. Horns flare in the crosswinds of ""Metropolitan Glide"", as if alluding to all the early 20th century artists, poets, and musicians who tried to capture the hectic rhythms of the cities with equally hectic jabs of paint, word, and noise. The percussion is crucial here, whether Waits is breathing beats into the mic or his son Casey is pounding out railroad rhythms on ""Get Behind the Mule"". Opener ""Lucinda/Ain't Goin' Down"" sounds better here than it did on <i>Orphans</i>, losing its beatbox backing track for a lurching ranginess that suits Waits' delivery. Likewise, ""Such a Scream"" and ""Goin' Out West"" possess a new aggression as Waits unleashes a series of dime-novel machismo boasts: ""I don't lose my composure in a high-speed chase,"" he grunts. ""My friends say I'm ugly, but I got a masculine face.""</p>
<p>Waits flirts with self-parody on ""Circus"" and ""I'll Shoot the Moon"", but he's been doing that for years. ""Circus"", from 2004's <i>Real Gone</i>, is a rambling tale of carnival characters, and ""Moon"" is a loose, loungey crooner with minimal accompaniment-- two sides of the same Waits. On the latter, he commandeers the bridge to hit on a barfly, rattling off a fake phone number: Is it unintentional schtick or simply part of the character Waits is playing in the song? He can get sentimental and even maudlin on ""Fannin Street"" and ""The Part You Throw Away"", but he's never sappy. Closer ""Lucky Day"" (like ""Moon"", from 1993's <i>The Black Rider</i>) ends the albums on a note that's both dreamily optimistic and earthbound by the vagaries of his voice. That's the essential contradiction of late-career Waits: He is both an incorrigible dreamer and an inveterate realist.</p>
<p>He's also a darn good storyteller. Right before launching into ""Lucky Day"", he holds forth on the subject of eBay, namely bidding on the dying breath of Henry Ford. It's a typical Waits yarn, drawn out with unbelievable details dug up from America's weird past, and the audience reacts with guffaws and applause. What's atypical about this story, however, is that it's the only one included on <i>Glitter and Doom Live</i>. The rest have been compiled on a companion disc titled ""Tom Tales"", which consists of one 35-minute track of Waits expounding on a variety of subjects (Nazi alphabet soup, uncharitable shrimp) at a variety of venues. He's funny, of course, rattling off arcane factoids and admonishing a rowdy audience to get organized with their requests. While it's better to have these stories than not, their inclusion feels like an afterthought, a tacit admission that they might have been better mixed in among the songs to give a better sense of what an evening with Waits is really like. That's only a minor complaint, as their presence here-- even excised from their original context-- nicely supplements a particularly lively live album that is also a persuasive retrospective of Waits' last 20 years.</p></div>"|13725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13725-glitter-and-doom-live/|8.0|Stephen M.

The Music and Politics of Black Action Films 1968-75|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|1.0|0.0|['Soul Jazz']|2009-11-23 00:00:00|2009|2016-06-11 18:55:39.172147|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".bfk1y4ym0w.1.6:0.1.0.$13683/=1$13683.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>There's an interview with Curtis Mayfield on Rhino's 2xCD reissue of his <i>Super Fly</i> soundtrack that puts the contradictions of blaxploitation cinema's relationship with soul music into sharp, clear terms. ""For film, I usually would follow a script, and the script and its contents and all the characters and what the story was about would basically furnish me with ideas and depth to get actually into the happenings of that particular movie for scoring. However, when you're writing, just in general, you use the society and the happenings about yourself, the observances-- that becomes your script."" The perception of life through the lens of entertainment came through two separate channels when the rise of black action films in the 1970s coincided with the peak of soul music's conscious period. And when those two art forms combined in an attempt to define African-American pop culture in the post-civil rights era, a precarious balance was struck. The eyes see the hustler in his custom Cadillac, take-no-shit masculinity defined through his money and his sexual conquests and the way he throws his weight around; the ears hear a portrayal of that man as ""a victim of ghetto demands... been told I can't be nothin' else, just a hustler in spite of myself.""</p>
<p>Mayfield's ""Pusherman""-- along with Willie Hutch's ""Brother's Gonna Work It Out"", Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"", James Brown's ""Down and Out in New York City"", and many other songs-- represents that contradiction as part of Soul Jazz's 2xCD, 34-track collection <i>Can You Dig It? The Music and Politics of Black Action Films 1968-1975</i>. And because it's such a wide-ranging collection for its size, this box tells a thorough story just through the names on the back. You have stars at their peak, up-and-comers, fusion icons, jazz innovators turned soundtrack specialists, and a few composers who adapted to the genre from the outside. (The theme to <i>The Soul of Nigger Charley</i>, for instance, was written by Don Costa a few years after he produced and arranged Frank Sinatra's rendition of ""My Way"".)</p>
<p>But this collection's personality doesn't just come through the motley collection of musical backgrounds and career arcs represented in the personnel, and the songs on <i>Can You Dig It?</i> run a gamut of moods and themes even broader than the movies that spawned them. The aforementioned social-conscience numbers stand out; ""Freddie's Dead"" and ""Across 110th Street"" in particular are peerless when it comes to fusing cool, resilient poise and deep, desperate sorrow. And there are a few choice examples of the other big musical trope to come out of the genre-- the wave of ""introducing the badass"" title themes that followed in the wake of ""Shaft"", flashy character sketches of a new epoch of black power-meets-action hero icons. To give you an idea of how varied these could be, check out the themes for two different Pam Grier vehicles: Ayers' ""Coffy Is the Color"" uses the protagonist's name as a jumping-off point to riff off an abstract awareness of blackness as strength (""Coffy is the color of your skin/ Coffy is the world you live in... Coffy is feelin' something deep, yeah""), while Hutch's ""Theme of Foxy Brown"" falls somewhere between a declaration of the heroine's tough-woman nature and a straight-up mash note (""Oh girl you're cute and you're sweet/ No, but you don't play around"").</p>
<p>Still, it should be noted that well over half of the tracks on this collection don't have any lyrics at all, and it's in these instrumental selections that the notions of pimp chic, ghetto struggle, and outsized bad-motherfucker caricature recede into something more nuanced and transformative. The wah-wah pedals, conga drums, and sucker-punch horn stabs of the genre are omnipresent, but with such a glut of films to be scored in such a short period of time, musicians had to constantly outdo themselves and find outlandish ways to be creative. That's how you get Dennis Coffey and Luchi De Jesus overlaying a bizarre, almost kazoo-esque scat-singing chorus over the theme from <i>Black Belt Jones</i> and Marvin Gaye pushing the envelope for 1972's <i>Trouble Man</i> by taking a Moog out of the turf of sci-fi films and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> to create the bassline for ""'T' Plays It Cool"". Selections by Ayers (""Aragon""), Quincy Jones (""They Call Me MISTER Tibbs""), and the Blackbyrds (""Wilford's Gone"") parallel the developments in jazz-funk's rich crossover period. And uptempo selections like Hayes' tense but funky ""Run Fay Run"" and ""Pursuit of the Pimpmobile"", J.J. Johnson's Latin jazz-tinged ""Willie Chase"", and Grant Green's all-percussion monster ""Traveling to Get to Doc"" aren't just music to stage car chases by, they're also dancefloor-ready classics that fit neatly into the early, pre-boom phase of disco.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, by an odd twist of fate the tone of black cinema mostly shifted from a focus on gunslinging action flicks to comedies and musicals around the same time disco started supplanting soul on the charts, and by 1978-- the same year <i>The Wiz </i>bombed hard enough to scare Hollywood away from big-budget films aimed towards black audiences-- the standard for R&amp;B-star Oscar winners had shifted from Isaac Hayes to Donna Summer. It's a mixed blessing: As the exhaustive, bigger-than-the-CD-case liner-notes book observes, there's a current generation of black directors and actors that have expanded roles far beyond the pimps, dealers, and private eyes of the 70s, but the veterans of that original, hard-fought renaissance period eventually wound up disappearing from both sides of the camera. And yet the music survives as strong as ever, renewed through the lens of the hip-hop generation that grew up with and reinterpreted it. When Spike Lee revisited the early 70s of his childhood for <i>Crooklyn</i>, ""Pusherman"" resurfaced not as the backdrop for a cocaine kingpin's internal struggles, but the accompaniment for a couple of siblings fighting over a box of Trix and the appearance of a couple of neighborhood glue-sniffers floating through Bed-Stuy upside-down. It worked there, too.</p></div>"|13683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13683-can-you-dig-it-the-music-and-politics-of-black-action-films-1968-75/|8.7|Nate Patrin

Eliot Krimsky sings about everyday mysteries in a relaxed, uncanny falsetto, tending to keyboards that dryly flicker and drone. Instruments from the classical world, as well as various junk percussion and vocal harmonies, meld unobtrusively, with the same laconic drift. The songs feel paradoxically compact and diffused, thanks to Mike Johnson's careful blend of live and electronic drums. His gauze-wrapped take on hip-hop makes all the wispy scrollwork feel unaccountably durable and lively.</p>
<p>Just looking through Glass Ghost's early press clues you in to the difficulties of classifying them-- people have already cited Deerhoof, Captain Beefheart, Dirty Projectors, and J Dilla, comparisons that range from approximate to baffling. Glass Ghost truly resemble just one band I can think of, and them only abstractly: the Dismemberment Plan circa <i>Change</i>, whittled down to the most salient gestures. It's all there on opening track ""Time Saving Trick""-- the hip-hop swing disarticulated in shining banks of fog, the wafting existentialism, the unspoken melancholy. And ""Mechanical Life"", with pointillist bass and skating keyboards, is mostly about brushing your teeth in a mirror. It perfectly captures the sort of mundane, displaced, anxious introspection that the Dismemberment Plan borrowed from Talking Heads and ran with so fruitfully.</p>
<p>That said, Glass Ghost is less lovable than the Dismemberment Plan-- perhaps less ingratiating. They're relentlessly sleepy and captivating, all ""Sentimental Man"" and no ""Following Through"". The complacent tonal register, Krimsky's dusky singing, and the deliberate scrawniness of the music all promise to be highly divisive, as most unique things are. And there are a few moments when the taste level falters-- on ""Ending"", when Krimsky sings, ""There's a place way up high where I hold my soul and cry,"" you hope he gets back to cryptic circumlocution quickly. ""The Same"" sports a poppier, more bugged-out look that Glass Ghost wear a bit less comfortably than swirling evasion. They're at their best on ""Time Saving Device"" and ""Mechanical Life"", not to mention ""Divisions"", with its ice-drop synth arpeggios, or ""Like a Diamond"", where a piercing vocal melody floats over keyboards like reflected clouds on scattered rain puddles. This is subtle, spooked, reflective music-- a distracted elegy for something or other.</p></div>"|13722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13722-idol-omen/|7.7|Brian Howe

I'll give the digest version here. There, Gnawa are practitioners of a musical-spiritual tradition rooted in Sufism, a mystical strain of Islam. The Gnawa tradition has its deepest roots in the Arab slave trade, in which sub-Saharan Africans were kidnapped and brought north over the desert to the Maghreb, in modern-day Morocco and Algeria, though today there is no ethnic dimension to it. Gnawa musicians, mystics, and dancers provide a communication conduit between people and the <i>jinn</i>, unseen beings of smokeless fire that are important not to anger. The word is the source of our ""genie,"" and one particular type of jinn, the <i>mluk</i> (literally, ""the owners"") is said to possess people who cross its path. One of the purposes of Gnawa ceremony is to negotiate with the mluk and send it packing-- it dovetails with the Sufi quest for spiritual purity.</p>
<p>An ""Ouled Bambara"" is a suite of Gnawa songs played during the Fraja, or entertainment, phase of a Gnawa ceremony. This set of field recordings made in Marrakesh by Caitlin McNally offers samplings of both this phase and the actual mluk phase. The recording carries the sonic flavor of the courtyards in which it was made, and the musical ingredients are simple. The singing is essentially a series of solo and group chants, and it doesn't follow any song forms familiar to Western ears. The whole body of music evolves as one, pushed along by hand claps on some tracks, and iron castanets or shakers on others, and at the heart of the sound is the guimbri, a three-stringed, guitar-like instrument with a  large, closed rectangular resonating box. The instrument has loose, thick strings and plays in a bass register, and the musicians frequently drum on the resonator while playing.</p>
<p>While it provides a harmonic outline, the primary function of the guimbri is rhythmic, and the musicians favor  gradually shifting patterns, changing tempos and rhythmic emphasis as the song suites unfold. The CD offers about an hour of recorded ceremonial music, and it's very transporting. Even without the extensive liner notes, it's an interesting experience to sit in on a ceremony so different from any of our own. The accompanying half-hour DVD adds a visual dimension, showing the playing techniques for the guimbri and castanets, giving us a glimpse of the dances and trance states, including one somewhat frightening moment where a trancing dancer collapses. It includes interviews with each performer and brief insight into their lives. Mohamed Hamada, the same dancer who collapses, works a day job stoking the flames of a furnace, while Brahim Belkani shows off photos of himself with Dizzy Gillespie, Robert Plant, and Jimmy Page.</p>
<p>It's hard to rate a recording like this in the context of a bunch of indie rock and hip hop records, because it comes from a different angle entirely-- music in this world is spiritual currency, not a product or a showcase, and it's important not to go into listening to it expecting something catchy or straightforwardly funky. It's a genuine field recording and makes no concessions to pop convention or avant-garde ideas. Of course, that's also what makes it a fantastic document of a unique and thriving cultural tradition, one that has a curious place in Moroccan society as neither mainstream nor outcast. Come to listen with the right mindset, and you'll learn a lot about it.</p></div>"|13723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13723-ouled-bambara-portraits-of-gnawa/|7.3|Joe Tangari

But unlike labelmates the Embassy or the Tough Alliance, Lake Heartbeat has little to no predilection for the quirky or slightly obtuse-- boasting a set of cleanly cultivated songs that employ a definitive celestial theme, their debut is a delicate reminder of how easy it is to still appreciate this brand of wistfully earnest pop romanticism. If it weren't for Dan Lissvik (one-half of the Balearic duo Studio)-- whose production lends a stardusted quality to the music that's so well honed it often upstages the actual songwriting--<i> Numbers </i>would likely fail to register as full and melodic as it is here in finished form. By submerging these stately singer-songwriter sketches in shimmeringly ethereal sonic environments, the record takes on an authentically transportive quality that joyously maps a strange and unfamiliar world where prom night was not only fun and meaningful, but the student council actually managed to pull-off the ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" theme.</p>
<p>In Stockholm, Sweden, where the duo-- former Brainpool frontman Janne Kask on vocal and electronics duty and guitarist Kallå Kåks-- is based, they're approaching that time of year where the city will be subjugated to 17 hours of darkness a day. And though there's certainly nothing dark about Lake Heartbeat, it makes perfect sense-- in Stockholm, at least-- to sit down with <i>Numbers</i> right now. Perhaps doomed to be lazily tagged as ""summery"" in some respects (the word itself is sung at least half a dozen times), this is a record that operates quite oppositely as perfectly suited for star-gazing: While the bulk of the lyrical content is steeped in love's cause and effect (heartbreak and longing, specifically), it's impossible to ignore the cosmic inclinations that afford this album much of its chilled, intoxicating whimsy. Almost everything is coated in dream-drenched twinkles, moonlit synth bursts, and loose gossamer guitar work, bolstered by playfully low-key beat programming and Kask's breathy, frost-bitten vocals. Reminiscence of a former love on ""Blue Planet"" finds Kask recalling lights in the sky and a promise that's now ""a thousand miles away""-- much like with the rest of <i>Numbers</i>, its heart remains in orbit no matter how landlocked the owner may be.</p>
<p>So it goes without saying that it's a little schmaltzy. Songs with more oomph tend to fare better: ""Pipedream"" has a polite anthemic quality to it, affording the peppy yacht-rock template some substance; ""Build the Wall Up"" nicks Spandau Ballet's ""True"" for a sparklingly airy lovers-only mid-tempo waltz. Wisely, the more patient numbers-- like the diluted-M83 appeal of ""Between Dreams"" or the irrepressibly comely ""Southbound""-- feature wonderfully balanced female backing vocals that add melodic shape to Kask's verging-on-the-creepy hushed tone. When left to handle long stretches of verse on his own, like on the tepid mostly-acoustic closer ""Let It Die"", the absence of all that fanciful hypnotic resonance renders things downright hammy. But the big starry-eyed moments win out with each repeated listen, even if songs like ""Mars By Night"" share more in common with a John Mayer deep-cut than anything this side of Jens Lekman. There's either a fun 1960s pop twist (""Golden Chain"") or a guardedly erotic soft-rock jam (""Between Dreams"", ""Southbound"") to move onto, sublimely woven into the fabric of this big, swirling dreamscape. For the most part: pretty far-out.</p></div>"|13719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13719-trust-in-numbers/|6.9|Zach Kelly

I've wondered that occasionally ever since I listened to 2007's odd pop-soul detour <i>The Third Hand</i> and wound up feeling disappointed at its almost defiant shift away from the production style that put him on the mainstream radar seven years ago. His buzz was still strong as of early 2006, when he helmed the beats on solid albums by Soul Position and Aceyalone that dropped in consecutive months. But it seems in the ensuing years that the only prominent reminder people still have of the often-melancholy but heavy-hitting style which once made him an heir apparent to the prog-cratedigger genius of DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator is the 37 seconds of ""A Beautiful Mine"" that accompanies Don Draper's animated freefall in the opening credits of ""Mad Men"".</p>
<p>So now that RJ has his own label and the rights to put his first three Definitive Jux releases out on it, he's created a good excuse to revisit his earlier catalogue in the form of a misleadingly-titled collectors-quality vinyl box set. The titular timeline notwithstanding, <i>2002-2010</i> as it's packaged sticks significantly to the first few years of his breakthrough success, starting with 2002's <i>Deadringer</i> and encompassing its 2004 follow-up, <i>Since We Last Spoke</i>, and a couple of EPs (2003's <i>The Horror</i> and the unreleased-material collection <i>Tin Foil Hat</i>). So if you want a crash course in what made RJ Krohn one of the most exciting new hip-hop producer-auteurs of the decade's first half, you've got a good headstart in here.</p>
<p><i>Deadringer</i> was the crucial first impression that many fans and critics intially judged RJD2 by, and that impression still lingers. After honing his skills with Columbus' MHz crew in the late 90s, RJ broke out big time as a production auteur with his solo debut, and already you can hear how versatile he could be. Opener ""The Horror"" is still completely, wonderfully ridiculous-- threatening and absurd at the same time, cartoon haunted house music that actually bumps harder than most early-00s indie rap. And that sense of semi-gothic hip-hop eeriness carries on through a number of different guises-- mournful soul-blues (""Smoke &amp; Mirrors""), break-chopping John Bonhamisms (""Chicken-Bone Circuit""), glowing psych-funk drone (""The Proxy""), mocking baroque choruses (""F.H.H."", featuring anti-backpacker broadsides from sneering MHz vet Jakki da Motamouth) and, most memorably, Copywrite's anguished message to his late father on the folk-jazz requiem ""June"".</p>
<p>That album's lasting impact ensured that at least some people might be thrown off a bit by <i>Since We Last Spoke</i>-- it's put together with much of the same cratedigger eclecticism and airtight drum programming as <i>Deadringer</i>, but in the service of a work that feels more like an attempt to build a rock- and new wave-influenced funk album out of samples. RJ went completely batshit crazy on this one: The opening title track turns the Stooges' ""Gimme Danger"" aesthetic inside-out and garnishes it with nicotine-stained synthesizers, ""Iced Lightning"" is arena-prog for fog-and-laser b-boy battles, ""Exotic Talk"" rides on a beat that sounds like Keith Moon/Tony Williams conjoined twins going at a 90-piece drum kit, and ""Through the Walls"" resembles a peak-period Cars track so much he actually got Ric Ocasek himself to sing on the remix. But the soulful sorrow that made <i>Deadringer</i> stand out still comes through in the more subdued moments-- ""Clean Living"" cops Sly Stone vibes off a late-70s funk rarity featuring a young L.A. Reid on drums, and closer ""One Day"" is heartbroken, late-night cocktail R&amp;B of the finest caliber-- making <i>Spoke</i> the equivalent of an unusually good alternate-universe free-form radio station circa 1978.</p>
<p>The other two pieces of the box aren't quite as essential, though people who already own the two full-lengths might want to keep them (and the really sharp screenprinted poster) in mind when considering this purchase. <i>The Horror</i> EP doesn't include much that's worth going out of your way for, though it's nice to have instrumental versions of <i>Deadringer</i> tracks ""Final Frontier"" and ""F.H.H."" and there's a song, ""Sell the World"", that does one hell of a number on Randy Newman's ""Last Night I Had a Dream"" with some phantasmagorical Brides of Funkenstein vocals. The <i>Tin Foil Hat</i> EP is the completist's draw, featuring seven mostly-good tracks left, it seems inexplicably, on the cutting-room floor; the nine-plus-minute suite ""Thine Planetarium"" and the ""Takeover""-gone-uptown strut of ""The Move"" (featuring underrated, since-vanished MHz member Tage Proto) are the most desirable of the bunch.</p>
<p><i>2002-2010</i> isn't entirely inaccurate as a title, since the box itself is large enough to accommodate your vinyl copies of <i>The Third Hand</i> and, presumably, next year's <i>The Colossus</i> if you want. (Or the lost-classic <i>In Rare Form: Unreleased Instrumentals</i>, for that matter.) But as it stands on its own, this slice of RJD2's 2002-2004 is a necessary reminder that, as hip-hop producers of this decade go, he still deserves consideration for top 10 status. And for that short window of time-- assuming the material on <i>Tin Foil Hat</i> doesn't fall too far outside that chronological window-- the scope and quality of the music here should be seen as nothing less than impressive. Here's hoping his next decade starts off as hot as this one did.</p></div>"|13631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13631-2002-2010/|8.2|Nate Patrin

I'm just starting to grow my hair long-- which never really worked out-- and I'm wearing a grey t-shirt sporting the hundred-yard-stare of Jim Morrison of the Doors. From across the street, a guy three times my age shouts: ""Fuck! Yeah! The Doors!"" And for that moment, we are brothers.</p>
<p><i>The Kids in the Hall'</i>s Bruce McCulloch argued that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xillqqt0Y0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Doors fans are born, not made</a>. But he ducks the question of why we're not making them anymore. Today, one of the first standard-bearers of rock is less hip than Journey. Let's review the case against the band: First we have Morrison himself, who's been blown into a caricature by his super-sexual persona, his wifty poetry, and his early death in a Paris bathtub.  The music sounds like a weird cross between shit-kicking blues-rock and brain-spraining acid-jams, and it's easier to get your avant-garage fix from the Velvet Underground, your rock shaman verse from Patti Smith (or not at all), or your psychedelic extravagance from countless <i>Nuggets</i> bands. As dead 1960s rockers go, Jimi's legacy has left Janis and Jim in the dust. It may be a strange way to put it, but the problem with the Doors is that they were not efficient.</p>
<p>Let's say that's where you are with this band. So here's how this set might change your mind.</p>
<p>Rhino has reissued all four sets from their gig at the Felt Forum in January 1970, right before the release of <i>Morrison Hotel</i>-- and still in the shadow of Morrison's drunken, obnoxious, and allegedly obscene performance in Miami, which threatened him with jail time. Many tracks from these shows have been released before, but on this box you can listen to them bootleg-style, with all the repeated songs, tuning breaks, and banter with the audience.</p>
<p>The <i>Live in New York </i>set sounds like an unedited performance, but in fact, the tapes had been so worked-over for other live albums that the team had to meticulously reconstruct it from 8-track and 2-track source tapes, using fan tapes as reference. Guest John Sebastian's harmonica wasn't even captured in the original mix; producer Bruce Botnick brought him back to the studio this year to replay the solos, based on what they got from tape bleed. Why go to the trouble? Because this is the truth. It's what the Doors sounded like, without the heavy hand of an Oliver Stone looking for the juicy parts-- and without the impatience of the iPod generation trying to trim it down.</p>
<p>As you listen to the set, Morrison doesn't come off as a self-absorbed mystic: He's far more like the troubled kid in school who couldn't sit still and didn't fear anything. He demands and rewards attention. He's petulant with the audience, even barking at them or pleading to ""give the singer some"" when they won't stop talking.</p>
<p>The vibe from the crowd may explain why the fourth show starts rough: After scolding the crowd, Morrison sounds disengaged or mocking as he wanders through the first few songs. But then he suddenly rewards the audience with a rare performance of his rock suite/poetry slam, ""Celebration of the Lizard"". The piece isn't exactly a lost classic-- it's not his most powerful verse, and musically it doesn't gel like ""The End""-- but the best thing about this recording is how <i>into</i> it Morrison gets, from the quiet couplets to the screams. It's easy to see how people fell in love with the poet no matter the poetry, although some of his verse is still dangerous: The ""Horse Latitudes"" poem that he interjects in ""Moonlight Drive"" boasts his strongest imagery, and the contrast between that and the seaside groove is still striking.</p>
<p>The rest of the band is here to support the star, and it never lets him down: The Doors were a loose, groovy, and ferocious combo, here playing a setlist that sticks to rock and blues and skips all the winsome and folky stuff that cluttered up <i>Waiting for the Sun </i>and <i>The</i> <i>Soft Parade</i>. Organist Ray Manzarek played the hooks that turned songs like ""Hello, I Love You"" into pop hits, but here he's focused on driving the rhythm section. Even his legendary solo on ""Light My Fire"" changes in concert from a melodic improvisation to a jam that climaxes in frustration, as you can hear him stabbing the keys with all ten fingers and wishing he had another ten besides. On the other hand, guitarist Robby Krieger is ferocious right from the riff of ""Roadhouse Blues"", and he makes their cover of Bo Diddley's ""Who Do You Love"" one of the best recordings the Doors ever made.</p>
<p>History hates this band for its excess, but so what? The Doors thrived on excess. When Morrison gears up the crowd with his groin and his ego and roars, ""gonna have a <i>re</i>-al, good time,"" no excess, no overdose, no scream is big enough for the good time he's got in mind. And that's the way to remember him.</p></div>"|13721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13721-live-in-new-york/|7.0|Chris Dahlen

It's a short list. The White Stripes will release a great one. So will <span class=""misspell"">Coldplay, t</span>he Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and the Killers. Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party have a chance, and <span class=""misspell"">Tegan</span> and Sara could get there, too. And... that's pretty much it. Many of the great alt-rock artists of this decade were also the great alt-rock artists of the decade before-- Radiohead, Beck, Björk, the Flaming Lips, etc. With radio going directly into the <span class=""misspell"">shitter</span>, most good rock bands haven't had a chance to make anything that could, even charitably, be regarded as a hit. Sorry, Animal Collective. The whole function of a greatest-hits album-- to rescue transcendent pop singles from shitty or just-OK albums-- doesn't even make sense when transcendent, <span class=""misspell"">monocultural</span> pop is something that barely even exists anymore.</p>
<p>Given a few more OK albums, <span class=""misspell"">widescreen</span> <span class=""misspell"">MOR</span> archdukes Snow Patrol <span class=""misspell"">might've</span> snuck their way into the above paragraph. Snow Patrol have always come across like a more workmanlike <span class=""misspell"">Coldplay</span>. Same celestial choruses, same overwhelming sense of longing, same epic U2-derived comfort-food melodies. But with Snow Patrol, you never get the idea that they're out to save the world or get their faces plastered up 80 feet high in Times Square. Even their biggest, most <span class=""misspell"">heartstring</span>-yanking tunes (""Chasing Cars"", ""Run"") concern simple and <span class=""misspell"">relatable</span> experiences: falling in love and shutting the whole world out, or falling out of love and feeling your whole world crumble. They're good at what they do, and they've quietly built up a deeply solid and satisfying run of singles. It shouldn't be a problem for these guys to slap together 12 of their biggest and call it a day.</p>
<p>That's not what they do on <i>Up to Now</i>. Instead, the band has to throw every <span class=""misspell"">goddam</span>n thing at the wall: singles, sure, but also B-sides and unreleased tracks and covers and side-project joints and live tracks. If you just want to hear the hits, you're not going to need a set of random tracks from the Reindeer Section, the Scottish indie <span class=""misspell"">supergroup</span> that Snow Patrol <span class=""misspell"">frontman</span> Gary <span class=""misspell"">Lightbody</span> also leads in his spare time. And if you're such a die-hard Snow Patrol <span class=""misspell"">completist</span> that you need all their shitty B-sides, you're... well, I don't know what the hell your deal is, but you probably don't need to own ""Chasing Cars"" again. The result: two deeply overstuffed <span class=""misspell"">CDs</span> with a few great moments but just as many songs that nobody will ever need to hear a second time.</p>
<p>The worst excess on the whole set is the band's half-joking ""Crazy in Love"" cover, which-- unlike, say, Antony's version-- does not excise the Jay-Z verse. Instead, someone from the band has to fuck around with one of those awful joke-rap voices. Jay-<span class=""misspell"">Z's</span> cultural references must not have quite the same currency in Britain, since whoever takes the verse gets a few things blatantly, hilariously wrong; ""Handle like Van <span class=""misspell"">Exel</span>"" becomes ""candle like <span class=""misspell"">benex</span> soup"" or something. But even without the verse, it's the limpest, most unfunny <span class=""misspell"">MOR</span> Brit-rock joke-cover since Travis did ""Baby One More Time"". Nearly as bad is the ""Run"" B-side ""Post-Punk Progression"", on which <span class=""misspell"">Lightbody</span> flattens his voice into an imitation Ian Curtis mutter and repeats the same line again and again over a fake Joy Division crawl: ""You won't be around forever, girl; you gotta grab life with both hands."" Is the song a joke? I have no idea. I just know it has no place on what <span class=""misspell"">could've</span> been a pretty great greatest-hits album.</p>
<p>The biggest problem, though, isn't the outright clunkers; it's the sheer length of the thing. Snow Patrol's basic sweep isn't the type of thing that holds up over two hours, and after the 20th straight-faced lovelorn hymn, you'll start climbing the walls. A crisp, chronologically sequenced set <span class=""misspell"">could've</span> been a whole lot of fun-- we <span class=""misspell"">could've</span> heard them evolve from the light <span class=""misspell"">Stereolab</span> and Imperial Teen influences of their early days on Jeepster to the blandly expert arena jams they'd learn to crank out. But <i>Up to Now</i> just piles everything together and dares you to delete the extraneous stuff from your <span class=""misspell"">iTunes</span>.</p></div>"|13693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13693-up-to-now/|5.1|Tom Breihan

In fact, Bob Mould and Grant Hart went their separate ways with such force that, if anything, nearly as much dust has been kicked up in the band's wake than even a group as volcanic and vital as Hüsker Dü managed to produce during its alt-landscape-shaping lifespan. In interviews over the years, both Mould and Hart have revealed a lingering bitterness over the breakup and its aftermath, with only bassist Greg Norton apparently able to totally leave the past behind.</p>
<p>If Norton got off easy it's likely because he got out, pursuing a career as a chef. Mould, on the other hand, has released nine solo albums and a couple with Sugar, each earning comparisons (for better or for worse) to his Hüsker Dü work. Hart, always the poppier and more rousing half of the Hüsker Dü equation, has been significantly less prolific. He was first out of the gate with a solo album, 1989's raw <i>Intolerance</i>, but after the failed band experiment Nova Mob, he didn't release another solo album until 1999's equally great but sadly overlooked <i>Good News for Modern Man</i>, a DIY affair that found Hart's voice and songwriting in top form.</p>
<p>Another decade has passed, and at last Hart has returned with a third solo album, <i>Hot Wax</i>, which he recorded off and on over the past few years in both Montreal and his hometown of Minneapolis, with members of Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Silver Mt. Zion assisting. The pedigree of the collaborators has changed Hart's musical outlook: <i>Hot Wax</i> is no slab of apocalyptic post-rock; rather, it's 1960s-infused garage pop clearly from the same soul that wrote all those era-defining Hüsker Dü classics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <i>Hot Wax</i> isn't nearly on par with Hart's Hüsker highs, let alone his two previous solo albums. While all the parts are in place, the results are oddly unfocused, too unpolished to do Hart's songs justice but too hooky and promising to stop you from to considering what could have been. In an ideal world, songs such as ""You're the Reflection of the Moon on the Water"", ""Charles Hollis Jones"", or ""California Zephyr"" would be blasting out of passing cars with all the primal zest of the best garage rock revivalists. Here, however, they come off relatively neutered by lo-fi fuzz, muffled and restrained where they should be exploding.</p>
<p>We do get a couple of stylistic excursions in the form of the British Invasion throwbacks ""Barbara"" and ""I Knew All About You Since Then"", each of which displays a firm grasp of the Kinks' theatrically foppish tendencies. At the same time, the power-ballads ""Schoolbuses Are for Children"" and ""My Regrets""-- power ballads once being one of Hart's greatest strengths-- falter where likeminded anthems like ""A Letter From Anne Marie"" (from <i>Good News</i>) soared, and the rollicking rocker<span> </span>""Sailor Jack"" never takes off the way ebullient frat rock templates like, say, ""Hang On, Sloopy"" do.</p>
<p>It'd be one thing if Hart's records graced shelves (virtual or no) more often. But 10 years is a long time to wait for a writer of Hart's stature, and the fact that <i>Hot Wax</i> delivers such uneven goods is, let's face it, a bit of a bummer. Hart can do-- and Hart fans deserve-- better. The only silver lining is the fact that the record exists at all, since by ending his silence Hart implicitly suggests there may be more to come. At least, one can hope.</p></div>"|13586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13586-hot-wax/|4.2|Joshua Klein

But unlike the most famous example of this phenomenon-- the Postal Service's <i>Give Up</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">-- the story of </span><i>Carpet Madness' </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">creation (short version: London-based French singer Eglantine Gouzy and South of France resident and instrumentalist Fred Landini exchanged tracks across the English channel via the Internet) is inaudible in its execution. These songs, delivered chirpily in Gouzy's charmingly butchered English, don't sound like the product of loneliness, estrangement, or longing, and in fact, the experimental brio of their creators makes them seem like the casually tossed off results of hours spent goofing off together in the studio-- even if the duo was separated by more than 600 miles the whole time.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Get Back Guinozzi!'s quirky aesthetic mines the coquettish 1960s pop vibe of yé-yé, the hollow drum machine precision and melodic bass throb of UK post-punk and dub, and the syncopated rhythms of reggae, and tropicalia to create a deliberately lo-fi result that fuses the homegrown and the exotic. But despite such worldly appearances, there is a deliberate naivety to the songs on <i>Carpet Madness</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. ""Go Back to School"" is marked by overdubbed vocals that sound like a children's choir, before girlish giggling punctuates its final minute. Their standout cover of Junior Murvin's ""Police and Thieves"" is sung in such a sweetly effervescent coo that it makes you wonder if Gouzy understands that the English-language lyrics are about police brutality. And ""I Don't Want to Sleep Alone"" is a ballad in a sea of uptempo tracks that opens with an unusually vulnerable vocal and a repetitive, twinkly guitar riff.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Though there is something to like about each of the giddily scattershot tracks on the album, they have a tendency to meander, either eschewing a conventional chorus and/or hook or developing one only to repeat it ad nauseum. But since Get Back Guinozzi! have no regard for genre conventions, restraint, or indie rock's self-seriousness, they are easily forgiven for such kookiness. After all, there is something delightfully gluttonous about them; they want to pursue every impulse they have and squeeze as many influences as possible into a barely three-minute pop song. And throughout it all, Gouzy sings like a Gallic crossbreed of Yoko Ono and Björk-- she is a mess of shrieky ululations and mush-mouthed pronunciation. Though that probably sounds like it would be annoying (and honestly, it can be at times), it is mostly fascinating, adding another layer of drama to tracks that are already bursting at their home-sewn seams with theatricality.</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span><i>Carpet Madness</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> sounds like it was well served by the long-distance that created it.

Yes, the music was punishingly loud and, sure, the chops on display were near godlike, but a bunch of dudes pumping their fists to a hard-rock supergroup? Once the domain of the Claptons and Crosbys of the music world, the supergroup seems to be coming back into vogue. From the Jack White-helmed Raconteurs and Dead Weather to the multi-bearded onslaught of Monsters of Folk, it feels like the confines around a musician's ""main band"" are looser than ever. Which makes sense: the majors' slow death and the general grab-bag atmosphere of the industry makes these collaborations easier than ever. And, of course, they open a new revenue source and creative outlet for the parties involved, so why not?</p>
<p>Well, history is littered with plenty of reasons why not (Velvet Revolver or Zwan ring a bell?), but even those dubious of these projects couldn't help but register excitement for Them Crooked Vultures, the much-talked-about alliance of Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme, Nirvana/Foo Fighter Dave Grohl, and John Paul Jones, who once played bass for this band called Led Zeppelin. (Also recording and touring with the band is QOTSA's Alain Johannes, let's not forget.) A few of those being, y'know, some of the greatest rock groups of all time and each player a fierce instrumentalist in his own right, the stage seemed set for these gents to join together, like Voltron, into some kind of indestructible hard-rock juggernaut. That happens occasionally on their self-titled debut, but the band also tussles with some of the same problems that have befallen many a supergroup before them.</p>
<p>As he's done with past iterations of QOTSA and his long-running <i>Desert Sessions</i> project, Homme takes the lead here, serving as frontman and steering the musical direction. The record features all the trademarks of a Homme-led affair-- druggy, mutant blues, loud/soft dynamics, songs about sex, and regular forays into the silly and absurd. The musicianship throughout is as phenomenal as you'd expect, and on a gut level it's thrilling just to hear these three men play together-- the way Grohl's snapping drum hits ricochet off Jones' rapid-fire bass notes on songs like ""Scumbag Blues"", for instance. (Grohl, in particular, is excellent throughout, affirming once again his destined place in a rock band.) And the guys themselves are clearly having fun. Amidst all the technical shredding, there's a looseness at play that seems to stem in part from Homme and Grohl getting to live out a boyhood fantasy. Oddly that becomes kind of a problem on the record.</p>
<p>One of the negative aspects of a supergroup is that the presence of multiple stars tends to disrupt the natural hierarchy of a band-- meaning that there's no one to shoot down bad or unnecessary ideas. If you're Josh Homme and John Paul Jones or Dave Grohl wants to take a bass or drum solo, you let him. And <i>Them Crooked Vultures</i> often feels overstuffed with the weight of too many ideas. This is especially true on longer cuts such as ""Elephants"" and ""Warsaw or the First Breath You Take After You Give Up"", the latter nearly eight minutes of prog-fueled, time-signatured madness that closes with an extended instrumental outro. Sure, these guys have earned the right to do that, but that doesn't make it a good song. Yet for each of these trying numbers, there's a muscular hard-rock track like ""Dead End Friends"" that helps make up for it. And if you simply want to hear Homme/Jones/Grohl sync into a furious, interlocking groove, there are songs like ""Gunman"" that offer that too. Having said that, <i>Them Crooked Vultures</i> still feels like a record to be checked off a list rather than one to live with and fully invest in.</p></div>"|13717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13717-them-crooked-vultures/|6.2|Joe Colly

It's not a lack of talent-- they've got a stellar singer (and a pretty good one), and their songs are smart and durable. They're not particularly derivative, aside from their undying love for the Philadelphia soul scene that brought them together, and anyway it's not as if there are many pop artists with a fixation on that particular sound. Hall's a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6673-daryl-hall/"" target=""_blank"">fascinating interview subject</a>. But the pong of tackiness hovers around them, and this lovingly assembled, more-than-complete boxed set doesn't dispel it.</p>
<p>The first disc begins with shruggable late-1960s singles by their individual teenage soul projects, the Temptones (Hall) and the Masters (Oates), then surveys the early albums on which Hall and Oates were a nearly hitless cult item (""She's Gone"" squeaked up to #60 on the pop charts on its initial release). It ends with five songs from a 1975 London concert, by which point they seem to have settled into being an agreeable, quirky soft-rock band with really nice harmonies and a taste for the smoother end of R&amp;B.</p>
<p>On the second disc, though, both their gifts for tune and arrangement and their peculiar lapses of taste start to assert themselves. The heavy, daisy-chained hooks of ""Gino (The Manager)"" are ahead of their time-- it wouldn't sound far out of place on an A.C. Newman album-- but it is, in fact, about their then-manager (Tommy Mottola!), and for this set, Hall has jarringly replaced the original recording's drums and remixed it. ""I Don't Wanna Lose You"" is an airy Philly disco pastiche with a great chorus, but Hall nearly sinks it with oversinging. Oates takes the lead for a totally unnecessary cover of ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"". Perfectly nice grooves are defaced with curlicues of check-out-my-bulging-forehead-veins saxophone. Everything is bluntly in earnest. (Hall, in the liner notes, on ""Wait for Me"": ""It's a true story. I was feeling a certain way. I sat down and wrote the song and there it is."" Well, that settles that.)</p>
<p>Their willingness to bend with the times worked out well for their career peak, the 1980-1985 period documented on Disc Three. Hall and Oates were never quite a new wave act, but new wave's insistence on formal economy and freshness of sound were just the tonic they needed:  ""You Make My Dreams"" appropriates Devo's jerky rhythms in the service of yacht rock, and ""Private Eyes"" is essentially David Bowie's ""Fashion"" with all the archness stripped out of it. ""I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)"", their biggest hit, is everything they do best in one place: an ingeniously knotty melody, effortless starbursts of harmonies, Hall vamping freely, and an arrangement like nothing else on the radio. ""One on One"" builds a ballad around its percolating drum machine pretty much the same way. Then they discover the Mid-80s Massive Gated Snare Sound, fire off a few more good songs from within the chasm of the big bam boom, and wrap up their pre-separation career by trotting out David Ruffin and Eddie Kendrick for an embarrassing Temptations medley on a live-at-the-Apollo album-- the official jump of the shark.</p>
<p>The fourth disc, documenting everything from 1988's way too optimistically titled reunion album <i>Ooh Yeah!</i> to the present, is one long comedown, chiefly because their songwriting mojo seems to have totally dried up around 1990. After a sampling of that year's <i>Change of Season</i> album, we get one live track from a Japanese tour five years later, and then boom, it's 2003, and as Oates puts it, ""we were working with a team of English writers for the <i>Do It for Love</i> album,"" and they're covering Billy Paul and Mad Lads songs, and everything's wrap-up and nostalgia and testimonial dinner. (There's no sign of 1997's <i>Marigold Sky</i> or 2004's covers album <i>Our Kind of Soul</i>, or for that matter 2006's <i>Home for Christmas</i>. Just as well, really.)</p>
<p>There's about a disc's worth of excellent pop sprinkled throughout this set-- the same disc's worth that makes up half of <i>The Essential Daryl Hall and John Oates</i>, in fact. Hall and Oates are one of the last long-running, big-name acts to get a boxed set, and listening to the thing suggests why: their hits are toweringly better than almost everything else here, and the ""everything else"" part doesn't do much to illuminate the hits. They insist they're still a going concern, but <i>Do What You Want, Be What You Are</i> feels like a gold watch-- a pro forma reward for four decades of more or less reliable service.</p></div>"|13716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13716-do-what-you-want-be-what-you-are-the-music-of-daryl-hall-and-john-oates/|4.8|Douglas Wolk

Many of grime's primary mediums  are transient: pirate radio sets, rave clashes, or street DVD slews.  So it's difficult to sum up even the best grime artists on recorded output alone. Roll Deep's <i>Street Anthems</i> compilation comes close to doing so, however. It helps that Roll Deep are heavyweights, the equivalent of the Murderer's Row of baseball's New York Yankees or <i>galacticos</i> of soccer's Real Madrid. Among the stars that have passed through  its ranks and repped on this compilation are Wiley-- who formed Roll Deep from the ashes of another great grime collective, Pay As U Go, and helped usher the genre from rap-infused UK garage to what it is today-- the chart-topping Dizzee Rascal, supersub  star Tinchy Stryder, yardcore MC Riko, Boy Betta Know's Skepta, dubstep  fave Flowdan, and wordsmith Trim. Through their vision, experimentation, and aggression, much of grime's best moves were devised.</p>
<p>In fact, when the crew falls it's when they try to  play by other people's rules-- namely the pop industry's. You can  understand the motivation behind such chartbait as ""Shake a Leg"", ""Avenue"", and  ""Do Me Wrong""-- commercial gain, the chance to reach  a wider audience, and a reverence for U.S. pop-- but those tracks pale in comparison  to the output of their transatlantic cousins that inspired them.</p>
<p>Like grime itself, when Roll  Deep define their own terms they are strongest-- shockingly innovative and brutally uncompromising.  Recent bangers, made before the crew's  focus shifted to respective solo projects, hold their own. ""When I'm  'Ere"" lays fearsome bars from the crew over Danny Weed and Target production  trademarks. ""Celebrate"" is the closest they come to credible pop,  its riff hinting at their early Sinogrime productions.</p>
<p>But it's when <i>Street Anthems</i> unearths the relatively lost classics that the importance of  the compilation is apparent. Early grime anthems like ""Roll  Deep Regular"" and ""Bounce"" were critical in the creation of a  unique, shockingly original genre, different from the DJ-based, house-inspired  UK garage scene it rose out of. Wiley's glacial ""eski"" synths  sounded cold and alien. MCs laced these distant and strange beats them with acutely local bars-- lyrics  dripping in East London slang and narratives. Yet early Roll Deep wasn't exclusively explosive  and aggressive. ""U Were Always"", which features Wiley, Dizzee Rascal, and Ruff Sqwad's Tinchy Stryder, shows a gentler side to the sound,  exchanging jungle and dancehall for R&amp;B slowjams as an input variable  in their mutant new algorhythm.</p>
<p>Yet even amid this embarrassment  of riches, <i>Street Anthems</i> has two glittering centrepieces. If  there's one track that cemented grime as a unique proposition and  propelled Roll Deep to an A-list crew, it's the instrumental of Wiley's  ""Eskimo"". Even after nearly a half-dozen Wiley solo albums-- and  twice as many affiliated mixtapes from the crew-- these vocal mixes remained  lost until now. The original vocal is completely unheard and the fearsome  remix was to be found only on the leaked <i>Creeper Vol 2</i> mixtape.  Their appearance here is long overdue, with Riko and Trim destroying  the remix and Dizzee-- his voice young, angry, and raw-- spitting  the kind of gunchat you wouldn't catch him dead doing these days.  These days Dizzee rules the charts: Roll Deep not only run the roads,  they paved them.</p></div>"|13655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13655-street-anthems/|8.5|Martin Clark

In the case of <i>Local Currency</i>, a collection of vinyl releases and compilation appearances made in the mid-to-late 1990s by Franklin Bruno, the honor is given to award-winning poet and <i>The Nation.</i> columnist Ange Mlinko.  In addition to offering many kind words in Bruno's behalf, Mlinko compares his brand of musical erudition (specifically his lyrics) with the ouevres proffered by a rather daunting Mount Rushmore: Elvis Costello, Morrissey, Jonathan Richman, and Bob Dylan.  Impressive company, to be sure, even if it's company that one would be hard pressed to weigh any songwriter against.  For those a little suspect of such lofty praise, you're not alone: The liner notes also include some words from Bruno himself, a self-administered roast to Mlinko's well-meaning toast.  Going through this album track by track, he leads listeners down this decade-old memory lane, never hesitating to point out the overgrown lawns and dilapidated storefronts that dot the landscape.</p>
<p>Of course, an artist is often his fiercest critic, especially when it comes to their earlier works, as this description of one of <i>Local Currency</i>'s few low points (""Soggy Girl"") demonstrates: ""Imitate Calvin Johnson over a borrowed Public Enemy cassette and gratuitous key changes? Sign me up.""  Bruno also makes unflattering mention of his penchant for arcane references (cf. the shout-out to ""goddamn"" Joseph Cornell on ""In a Sourceless Light""), his less-than-robust singing voice, his more-than-robust vocabulary, and even, as he describes it, ""my disinclination to distinguish between 'pop' and 'experimental,' thus resulting in releases no one could enjoy straight through.""  And while there are a small handful of examples on <i>Local Currency</i> where Bruno's impeccable melodic instincts clash less favorably with his more experimental impulses-- the mish-mash of feedback, lo-fi tape-splice chicanery, and all-but-spoken-word meandering on ""About You I'd Ask"" come to mind-- it's those potentially questionable digressions that inform and strengthen his more traditional verse-chorus work.  As growing-pain portraits go, <i>Local Currency</i> is the sort of warts-and-all release that most songwriters would love to call their own.</p>
<p>In many ways, this compilation serves as a microcosm of Bruno's musical growth, running the gamut from his days fronting the power-poptastic Nothing Painted Blue (with ""Wholly Heavy Heart"" sounding just like a lost 0PB cut) to his modern-day dalliances with more traditional forms of songwriting (exhibited by the solo-piano Tin-Pan-Alleyisms of ""News From Cupid"").  In between these poles, Bruno offers some of the more thoughtful songs, love and otherwise, that the Amerindie underground had to offer.  Bruno himself politely mocks this practice in one of the tunes here-- ""The 101st"", with the number in the title referring to the number of songs the narrator has written (or is about to write) about a certain special someone.  But there's not much to mock if the songs in question are as heartbreaking as ""Keeping the Weekend Free"", or as despairing as ""Pointless Triangle"". Both these tunes were given flattering higher-fidelity interpretations by former Tsunami bandleader/Simple Machines labelhead Jenny Toomey-- the former on Liquorice's <i>Listening Cap</i>; the latter on Toomey's Bruno-abetted <i>Tempting</i>-- and while those versions might be prettier and shinier, there's something to be said for hearing these sentiments and songs in the writer's original voice.</p>
<p>What could get lost while admiring Bruno's lyrical knack is that his way with a tune, and his knack for getting form and fucntion to work together, is equally impressive.  ""In a Sourceless Light"" finds Bruno playfully prodding someone who'd look better in the titular light-- ""if your shadow didn't follow you around""-- with a chiming Rickenbacker echoing his spry wit, while ""Shooting Past Me"" is an embittered and eloquent kiss-off whose starkness feeds into the song's autumnal pallor.  Bruno also manages to pull off a ""pop""/""experimental"" coup of sorts with ""Medium of Exchange"", melding one of his sweeter melodies and seemingly sweeter lyrics (""If I could wave a magic wand/ I would cross every lily pond"") to a Frankensteinian backing track that's anything but sweet.  Even when he tackles subjects less fraught with pathos, like his own medical misfortunes on the whimsical ""Cat-Scratch Fever"", there's no lacking for musical or lyrical cleverness-- it's rare for a track here not to offer the listener something worth holding onto.</p>
<p>In the decade-plus since the newest tune on this compilation was originally released, Franklin Bruno's songwriting has grown immeasurably, exchanging the more pronounced flourishes of skill and smarts with more subtle, yet no less effective, shows of intellectual force-- it's evident on Bruno's last solo album (<i>A Cat May Look at a Queen</i>), and on <i>Civics</i>, the first album from his new band, the Human Hearts.  Some that are fond of the songs from Bruno's salad days might see this newer work as a step back from what's on display in <i>Local Currency</i>, while others are more in tune with where Bruno's muse is currently leading him.  But regardless of where fans stand, it's safe to say that Bruno himself won't ever be complacent with what he's done-- in regards to the final track on <i>Local Currency</i>, ""Dream Worth Dreaming"", the usually effusive Bruno has only two words: ""Still looking.""</p></div>"|13639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13639-local-currency-solo-1992-1998/|7.5|David Raposa

Honestly? Yes, you totally weird us out, dude. Unlike with most of the neurotic arrested development cases you come across in popular culture-- your Woody Allens, anyone who has Judd Apatow in their ""five""-- this sadsack figure possesses literally no sense of self-deprecating humor, is constantly waxing pathetic, and yet is somehow no less endearing and sympathetic for it. Now whether these songs document the real-life romantic pinings of frontman Brian Island or are simply a batch of shaggy jams ripped from the lovesick diary of a 15-year-old beach punk, there's an underlying story arc that saves <i>Blackout Summer </i>from being just another collection of ramshackle bummer strummers.</p>
<p>Part of the burgeoning San Diego lo-fi scene that's home to seedy droners like Crocodiles and garage revivalists like the Soft Pack, three-pieced Christmas Island are the most obvious candidate for a middle-ground house band of the movement, their amateurish ambling rendered more charming with every heartbroken admission, typically undercut by a radiant guitar lick or a breezy little groove. It's this same sort of dichotomy that characterizes most of <i>Blackout Summer</i>: The sunniest numbers are usually about rejection, depression, or the inevitability of rejection and depression (the cheery ""Doin' Swell"" boasts the lyric, ""He hung his head and cried, he hung his head and died"") and the flatter, murkier numbers are usually the hard-line love song laments (""I Don't Care"", a flip of the Ramones' song of the same name, is actually a lap-dog fantasy-- ""I don't care what you wanna do... I will do anything with you""). The band itself was actually formed after Island and now-drummer Lucy Wehryl started dating, which is kind of surprising, seeing as most of the songs here sound like the hopeless brooding of a frustrated virgin-- if that shit flew with most girls, 80% of existing pop songs would vanish instantaneously. And even while the music itself might be too categorical or flat (the band never dares delineate from their brand of frayed, play-it-loose garage-pop), a curious and compelling little study in teenage misanthropy emerges, nicely defining a complex hormonal state and the dunderheaded frustration that accompanies.</p>
<p>Take ""Dinosaurs"", by all accounts a mercilessly dumb goof that proudly features lines like, ""I can't believe you ever existed, I'm really bummed out that I missed it."" But with Island's slouch-shouldered delivery of lines like, ""I wish I could take a time machine, to a time before human beings,"" the song transforms into a simple confession of feeling out of place. It's especially apparent when wedged snugly up against ""It's True"", a less-nerdy version of ""Dinosaurs"" that's such a truly unbecoming song, so full of self-pity and doubt (""I don't know what the hell I'm doing, I'm no good at being human"") that it's hard not to see the two sides of the typical adolescent experience coexist: one shrouded in pimpled vices, the other embarrassingly earnest. This eventually brings us to ""Weird You Out"", an unsettling climax that's as sadsack as it is nutjob, a hopeless final plea that hinges on the very creepy promise, ""I'll see you at 10."" Played as both a timid first-date confirmation and a chilly threat at the same time, it affords some much needed contextual support for <i>Blackout Summer</i>; you won't remember the chorus, but hopefully you remember feeling sorry for someone, maybe even yourself.</p>
<p>If any of this is deliberate, it works extremely well, though obviously not subtly. Ronettes-influenced slow burner ""My Baby"" closes things out, as girl-leaves-boy (or disputes existence of boy) and fuck-everything thoughts like, ""It's like you're nonexistent"" permeate the air, confirming what everyone but our protagonist saw coming. It's a neat little package, even if the music itself is so stubbornly unvaried.

<p>Even if CD releases and official track listings are formal considerations that are not entirely significant to Annie's context as a star in a largely theoretical Internet pop universe, it's almost impossible to engage with any version of <i>Don't Stop</i> without thinking about what is ""missing."" The most notable omissions from <i>Don't Stop</i> are its top-notch lead single ""I Know UR Girlfriend Hates Me"" and its Italo-disco follow-up ""Anthonio"", each co-written and produced by Hannah Robinson and Richard X, the duo who previously collaborated with Annie on the excellent <i>Anniemal</i> tracks ""Chewing Gum"" and ""Me Plus One"". Though these songs were cut, ostensibly in the interest of keeping the album fresh, it's perplexing to remove such strong material. To make matters worse, the only track from Robinson and X to make it to the official <i>Don't Stop</i> is the clear highlight ""Songs Remind Me of You"". This is a strange thing: If Annie has so much proven chemistry with these two writers, why isn't she doing more with them?</p>
<p>At least part of the answer to that question is that she's been busy working with other producers, namely Girls Aloud masterminds Xenomania, Bloc Party and the Rapture collaborator Paul Epworth, and Timo Kaukolampi, who co-wrote a majority of her debut. Each has a distinct aesthetic, but there is enough balance and common ground in the arrangements that Epworth's sleek electro and Kaukolampi's dense rhythms are complemented rather than overwhelmed by Xenomania's hyperactive hooks. That's not always the case for Annie herself, though. Her demure yet sassy voice is flattered by the production team's efforts on the zippy ""My Love Is Better"" and the cutesy ""Heaven and Hell"", but she's flattened by ""Loco"", a terrific song that is nonetheless so Xenomania-by-numbers that it simply sounds like a Girls Aloud single dropped in the middle of an Annie album. It's not all her fault, though. The Xenomania sound is just so overpowering that you'd never guess that Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand happen to play on the track as well.</p>
<p>Though the Xenomania cuts are all of good-to-great quality, Paul Epworth's tracks are far more successful in emphasizing Annie's character. ""Hey Annie"", a song not present on the original leaked version of <i>Don't Stop</i>, kicks the record off with layered rhythms and spare synthesizer accents that allow her usually wispy voice to be the richest, most alluring element in the arrangement. Whereas the Xenomania crew seem indifferent to her limitations as a vocalist, Epworth is good at finding ways to highlight her best qualities-- the gentle wit, the worldliness in her girlish tone-- while keeping the emphasis placed firmly on grooves. ""Hey Annie"", along with Epworth productions ""I Don't Like Your Band"" and ""Don't Stop"" are the songs that are most effective as dance music rather than perky Europop. That said, Kaukolampi's ""The Breakfast Song"" strives for dance floor utility, but unfortunately its blunt, insistent chorus-- ""What do you WANT? What do you want for BREAK-FAST?""-- comes out sounding like a maddening jingle for the Scandinavian equivalent of IHOP. His other contributions are respectable but not particularly exciting, though ""Take You Home"" does provide a dark center for a record generally lacking in melancholy and heavy moods.</p>
<p>It is standard practice for modern pop records to be assembled in this sort of piecemeal fashion, but Annie's choice of collaborators is very deliberate, both in terms of curatorial taste, and in finding the right artists to achieve the specific end of assembling a dynamic album.

As if lingering in the moment, he now issues <i>The Apple and the Tooth</i>, which collects remixes of his breakthrough album with four new tracks. They lack the immediate impact of <i>Avenue</i>'s highs, because they pull back from wrenched beats into the more familiar territories of folk and psychedelia. They're good tracks, they just grow on you more slowly. They'd have been even better if he'd finished them.</p>
<p>The title track is killer, although it sounds more Stones Throw than Warp-- bounding flute loops, ratcheting percussion, and whizzing guitars shimmy like a bum wheel. It seems like it's building toward something great, but then just ends after a couple of minutes, mid-development. ""Rotten Rudd"" does the same thing. At least ""Bones &amp; Skulls"", sparkling but thick with incense, feels more like a song than a draft. But then on ""Steal the Lamp"" (lava, one presumes), we're back to the two-minute bailout, after glowing scales traced around pittering drums prime us for a drenching psychedelic anthem.</p>
<p>The compelling yet skimpy new material feels mostly like an occasion for the remixes, some of which are actually quite worthwhile. Bibio's own retooling of ""Palm of Your Wave"" is arguably more essential than his new productions. The vocal is the same, but there's a new guitar part that snakes like ivy. It's meaningfully transformed, yet still angelically songful. The other successful remixes follow suit. Wax Stag smooths out the jumpy ""Sugarette"" into a dreamy new-wave ballad, its vocal accents cunningly wrought into a dainty music-box lead. Eskmo turns ""Dwrcan"" into a lurching, primordial thing, amplifying a faint oozy quality already latent in it. And Leatherette puts ""Lovers' Carvings"" on ice, using pitch-shifted vocal snippets to abstractly sketch its melody.</p>
<p>Others squander the rich source material, usually by interpreting ""remix"" as ""molest."" Clark epitomizes this approach, dousing fragments of ""S'vive"" in his magic powder and reorganizing them into a scattering, tempo-warped pulse. He produces some fascinating effects, but it seems more like an expo for his skills than a tribute to Bibio. If Clark goes too far, the Gentlemen Losers don't go far enough-- they simply strip ""Haikuesque"" almost nude, though it remains very pretty. Detuned squelches have gotten tired by the time Keaver &amp; Brause's ""Fire Ant"" comes around-- the baggy evocation of horns is kind of neat, but it's more like an extended vamp than a composition.</p>
<p>At the nadir, Lone makes ""All the Flowers"" sound abysmal with unattractive detuning and throttling. Why take on a minute-long interstitial, anyway, when no one's touched ""Jealous of Roses""? The omission of <i>Avenue</i>'s most daring, soulful track, and the recruitment of some remixers who represent the murky style Bibio only recently grew out of, make <i>The Apple and the Tooth</i> feel faintly regressive, although you can't read too much into a stopgap like this. The frugality of the new material forestalls the answer as to how Bibio will be able to top <i>Avenue</i>, but it's good enough to keep us asking the question.</p></div>"|13707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13707-the-apple-and-the-tooth/|6.2|Brian Howe

That album took her outside of her comfort zone, setting her vocals in ever more intricate soundscapes and tempering its shortcomings with a see-what-sticks experimental approach. <i>Ask the Night</i> was recorded in Omaha and Athens, Georgia-- two of Fink's old haunts-- and written partly with fellow Alabaman Chris Lawson, a Birmingham poet and artist who designed the album cover.</p>
<p>It ought to be more engaging and comfortable than <i>O+S</i>, but <i>Ask the Night</i> displays little of the compelling weirdness of her previous material. Losing the full-band sound of her 2005 solo debut, <i>Invisible Ones</i>, Fink adopts a more austere and rustic approach, recording a batch of coffeehouse tunes with a parallax relationship to genre: Her history and label suggest staunch indie folk (think any of the female Broken Social Scene offshoots). Considered from a slightly different angle, however, Fink sounds like she could open for more mainstream artists like Norah Jones or Vienna Teng.</p>
<p>""High Ground"" is an exception and the most obvious keeper, with its spectral mandolin, ragged backing vocals from Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock, and a chorus as incisive as it is evocative. ""There's a rain comin' down to the valley below, and I know just how they feel,"" Fink sings plaintively, before adding the clincher, ""'cause when the water rises, they start to look for high ground, just like me when you come around."" It's the album's best moment, a hint at what it could have been, but nothing else on <i>Ask the Night</i> even begins to approach the stark candor of that unraveling metaphor. Instead, she's content to ask vaguely rhetorical questions about the night (""Why is the night sad?"") or to counsel you to ask such questions (""Ask the night what it stole from you, and can it be returned?""). Such a fixation comes across not as a powerful existential equation, but as a frustrating obliqueness that gives the album a slipshod quality, as if these songs are rough-draft sketches instead of finished paintings.</p>
<p>In fact, at times she comes across as pandering, delivering pallid bromides like ""The Garden"" with its disingenuous there-there: ""If you lose your home, and you lose all you've worked for, if you lose it all, it's all right."" That's all the wisdom she's got for us, and her perkily staccato phrasing on that last syllable suggests a passive-aggressive spirituality that's useless in the face of real tragedy. Such moments might be more forgivable if they were more ignorable, but Fink writes spartan arrangements meant to highlight her vocals. That de-emphasis doesn't benefit the music, which is too tastefully low-key even on the lazy strut of ""Alabama"" and the modified waltz of ""Sister"". Fink has a lovely voice, clear and direct and expressive especially in its lower register, but her lyrical cadences don't always match up to their melodic lines, resulting in some awkward phrasings on ""Why Is the Night Sad"" and ""The Garden"". This is an album that suffers in the context of Fink's career. She is an obviously talented artist working well below the standards she's set for herself as both one half of Azure Ray and a solo artist, and if that makes for a disappointing album... well, it's not all right at all.</p></div>"|13702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13702-ask-the-night/|4.4|Stephen M.

His voice-- a gentle, reedy, wafting falsetto reminiscent of Bon Iver's Justin Vernon or TV on the Radio's Kyp Malone-- emotes nimbly, with little apparent effort. His music, a mostly laid-back blend of all sorts of rusty Americana, rarely causes a racket; hushed, you see. And he and the Arbors have made a leap from last year's self-titled affair that feels markedly deliberate and completely natural.</p>
<p>With help from another guy who makes what he does look easy-- Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, who produced and plays on the LP-- <i>Yankee Reality</i> does its predecessor a few better in the song department"", and then close it with to ""For Reality, Wood brought in 10 appealing agile country-rock leaning yearners, then he and Mascis went to town on 'em; whereas a good chunk of Hush Arbors' past work got by on a lot of impressionistic detail, for a genial, unhurried folk record, <i>Yankee Realit</i>y feels pretty direct. Yankee Reality's a confident but freewheeling set of finely tuned heartbreakers dressed up in rollicking arrangements that aren't allowed to run riot over the tunes.</p>
<p>Things get off to a nice start on brief spindly strummer ""Day Before"", brighter and busier than anything on <i>Hush Arbors</i>, imbued with an affecting lilt and lent further warmth once Wood gets to singing. Riding a standup-slap bassline, the searching ""Lisbon"" smacks of a properly medicated Okkervil River, while ""Fast Asleep"" shuffles and drones like a less maudlin Will Oldham number. Mascis makes his presence known with a few odd guitar stabs here and there, but he's at his best behind the boards, reigning in all the jerry-rigged instrumentation and keeping the spotlight on Wood's voice. Like Mascis, Wood's a bit of a mumbler, but his plainspoken lyrics have never felt so central to the music. And, while he'll occasionally lose you in a few too many swallowed syllables, every once in a while you get a ruminative road tripper like ""that old highway in my life"" or ""wondering how many bottles have led me to here,"" and <i>Yankee Reality</i>'s hazy essence rushes into focus.</p>
<p>There are a couple of moments on <i>Yankee Reality</i> that pass by without much notice, the warmth of Wood's voice and Mascis' enveloping production occasionally coming together to lull rather than linger. But on an album this mellow, a little balance is key to cohesion, especially when you get around to closer ""Devil Made You High"". It's a barnburner, blasting off into the stratosphere on the back of Mascis' racket and Wood's bleary, almost bluesy vocal. It's testament to what a fine pairing this is that they could pull off a tune like ""Devil"" and a tumbling rockabilly ballad like ""Coming Home"" with equal success and, more importantly, ease. Wherever Hush Arbors takes Wood next, here's hoping he and Mascis run into each other again along the way.</p></div>"|13711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13711-yankee-reality/|7.3|Paul Thompson

It's not a point I'd argue-- they were otherworldly. On <i>Portrait in Jazz</i> it doesn't even sound like three musicians playing. The record meets your ear like a feeling meets your brain-- you can't grasp it but you know it's there. Few pieces of music made by more than one person suggest quiet and solitude as powerfully.</p>
<p>The Vijay Iyer Trio, with Stephan Crump on bass and Marcus Gilmore on drums, is almost a negative image of the old Bill Evans Trio. The sense of telepathic interplay is there, but it's put toward different ends. If <i>Portrait in Jazz</i> is the sound of aloneness, <i>Historicity</i> is the sound of crowds, a heaving, seething swirl of cross-talk, phrases meeting in often unexpected combinations. It reflects how far both jazz and our world have come in the last 50-odd years. Today, we're never far from information and chatter, and Iyer uses both his own compositions and those of others to stir conversation with his bandmates.</p>
<p>The most strikingly modern and heavy-hitting track is Iyer's cover of M.I.A.'s ""Galang"", a startling, compact, and ultimately breathtaking reinvention of the song. It's not some Brad Mehldau look-a-jazz-guy-playing-Radiohead thing either-- this has all the vitality of the original coursing through its thundering block chords, funky backbeat, and fluttering hints of melody on the chorus. He uses the upper octaves of the piano to hammer out a Morse code-like pattern at the beginning of each verse. It stands perfectly well on its own, but it also made me appreciate the original more than I used to, which is about all you can ask of a cover.</p>
<p>The other covers don't require quite as much stretching. Stevie Wonder's ""Big Brother"" is a natural fit for this trio, while the version of pianist Andrew Hill's ""Smoke Stack"" reveals an ingredient in Iyer's own sound with its rushing phrases and unceasing motion. Historicity is defined in the liners as ""a condition of being placed in the stream of history,"" and this is something jazz musicians have long been conscious of and displayed in the way they quote each other or interpret each other's tunes. Iyer's placement of a Hill interpretation right next to his own ""Helix"", a cascading, slow-building composition that showcases his pulsing chord-cloud style, historicizes his work in a way by showing its roots. Gilmore's solo is a marvel of textured, nuanced drumming that never gives up its sense of rhythm.</p>
<p>The trio's take on Julius Hemphill's ""Dogon A.D."" is faithful to the original's sense of hobbled rhythm and high/low melodic interaction, with Iyer's piano dueling against Crump's lurching arco bass. Iyer's own ""Segment for Sentiment #2"" creates a space for reflection at the album's close, dialing back the ferocity of the trio's interplay for a quiet, almost Evans-ish conversation. It's the kind of respite from daily overstimulation we all need. Iyer and his cohorts have spun the piano trio format into great art here, acknowledging their contemporaries and their musical ancestors. Iyer may be floating in the stream of jazz history now, but if he keeps making records like this, he may one day be a rock that influences the stream's very flow.</p></div>"|13412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13412-historicity/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Frontman Martin Courtney had just returned home to his native Ridgewood from college in Washington State, a few fresh songs in his pockets. He'd been playing music with bassist Alex Bleeker and guitarist Matthew Mondanile since high school in various forms, even covering Weezer and the Strokes records from tip to tail. But during the summer of 2008, Real Estate didn't get nostalgic for just their specific suburban nights, crushes, or favorite bands as teens-- they fashioned a tin can-and-string to memories more universal. Their self-titled debut LP is a collection of those first underwater pop songs and onward, 7"" cuts and mpfrees that have been backstroking their way across the Web and into lo-fi nerdpiles. Over the past year, many of these songs have soundtracked a time when it feels like every kid in or just out of college seems to be handcrafting/clamoring for music that shuttles us back to a time before career choices, adult responsibility, and this recession.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>And while the Jersey Shore has clearly become the beating heart of their current aesthetic, Real Estate captures a rock band several lengths ahead of the fuzzy beach bums with which they pine. Real Estate share tones with North Jersey indie rock titans Yo La Tengo and the Feelies, pouring those influences through warm impressions of oldies radio. Riffs are cyclical and massaged, harmonies familiar. Each song is dunked in reverb and delay, though always with serious restraint. Most importantly, all boast architecture that still allows for swaths of jamming, the feeling that every measure's unfolding as easily as life ought to.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>""Atlantic City"" is a fitting entrance point, an instrumental that lopes along on a humid bass line before Courtney and Mondanile (the mind behind the cassette adventures of Ducktails) begin gently braiding together strands of trebly surf guitar over Mexican <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCiro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>güiro</span></a>. Single ""Beach Comber"" keeps things light as Courtney looks for meaning in the sand while Mondanile pokes around with his Strat. The bedrock here (see ""Fake Blues"") is almost krautrock-y in the way each layer repeats itself, a bent that might prove too drowsy for some. But as is the case for much of the experience, Mondanile adds classic rock sugars throughout, taking off on a solo at the three-minute mark that unbuttons everything really gracefully.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Elsewhere, ""Black Lake"" is a gorgeous waltz whose slide recalls Modest Mouse's late-1990s take on the 1959 Santo &amp; Jonny classic ""Sleepwalk"". Because Courtney's croon can be tough to make out at times, those watercolor frequencies lend that overwhelming sense of longing real grip, jam passages often more evocative than spaces that feature vocals. Nowhere on this debut is that better absorbed than on midpoint palate-cleanser ""Let's Rock the Beach"" or the six-minute shimmer of ""Suburban Beverage"".</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>With the exception of the limp ""Pool Swimmers"", every part remains remarkably crisp. But what sets <i>Real Estate</i> apart from the rest of the herd is how evergreen its beauty can be. Despite the summery song titles and the beach balling associations that might follow these guys around, this music transcends the notion of seasons. Inside the overcast tenor of ""Black Lake"" and the airy upstrokes of ""Green River"", there's much more at play here than what goes on between the months of June through September. And impressionism aside, this is a band whose chemistry and technical gifts suggest there's more coming down the pipeline: more good times to be soundtracked, and more songs and records and sounds to communicate exactly that.</span></p></div>"|13703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13703-real-estate/|8.5|David Bevan

But his initial, late-1960s forays into the music industry illustrate that there's a fine line between ""chameleonic"" and ""indecisive""-- in his early years, Bowie tried make his name variously as a mod bluesman, a traditional folksinger, an Anthony Newley-schooled theatrical raconteur and, on his 1967 self-titled debut, a music-hall dandy. Ironically, it was a song seemingly most susceptible to a brief, novelty-tune shelf life that would prove to be his first enduring work: the 1969 single ""Space Oddity"", which, of course, riffed on the similarly titled Stanley Kubrick blockbuster of the day, and was fortuitously timed to court a space-crazed populace still abuzz from that summer's lunar landing.</p>
<p>The ploy didn't quite pay off-- though the ""Space Oddity"" single cracked the UK Top 5, the sophomore album on which it appeared flopped, as the efforts to establish the David Bowie brand resulted in a confusing release strategy. His UK label, Phillips, issued the album in Britain as <i>David Bowie</i> (making it his second self-titled album), while his U.S. benefactors at Mercury christened it with a title that begged to have it relegated to the folk-section cut-out bin: <i>Man of Words/Man of Music</i>. But rather than prompt another career about-face, the album's prog-folk hymnals (complete with guest keyboard wizardry from Rick Wakeman of Yes) helped point the way to the artful glam-rock that would make Bowie a superstar-- upon which he would reissue the album in 1972 and rename it after its most famous song.</p>
<p>As such, this 40th-anniversary reissue of <i>Space Oddity</i> does not so much commemorate a great album-- it doesn't even rank among Bowie's 10 best-- but rather the true first chapter in an often brilliant career (not to mention the dawn of Bowie's fruitful collaborative relationship with producer Tony Visconti). Tellingly, the title track has opened pretty much every Bowie greatest-hits compilation of note, and rightfully so-- not only does its still-thrilling rocket-launch structure anticipate Bowie's own supernova ascent, the song's themes of splendid isolation and uncertain futurism would prove ever-present motifs in his work up through 1980's <i>Scary Monsters</i>. But if the song dramatically reinvents Bowie as a sci-fi folkie-- serving as the middle-man between late-60s hippie idealism and early-70s disillusionment-- with few exceptions, the rest of <i>Space Oddity</i> isn't quite as eager to thrust forth into the great unknown.</p>
<p>Instead, we hear a young dude who's still back home with his Beatles and his Stones (see: the perfunctory ""Hey Jude"" group-chorus coda of ""Memory of a Free Festival"" for the former; the extended blues boogie of ""Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed"" for the latter), with a well-worn copy of Love's <i>Forever Changes</i> close at hand-- all that's missing from the mellotronic psych-folk serenade ""An Occasional Dream"" is an Arthur Lee co-write credit. So amid these stately surroundings, side-one closer ""Cygnet Committee"" stands out not just by virtue of its nine-minute length, but for its strident disavowal of hippie platitudes (""[we] stoned the poor on slogans such as 'Wish you could hear!' 'Love is all we need!' 'Kick out the jams!' 'Kick out your mother!'""); likewise, Bowie's voice overpowers the song's languid folk-rock sway as if it were a shackle, introducing his signature technique of intensifying and accelerating his delivery to break free of the verses' pre-established cadences. It's the birth of the classic David Bowie Affectation-- the one that's been embraced/lampooned by everyone from the Frogs and Ween and Destroyer to Flight of the Conchords-- making ""Cygnet Committee"" as important a breakthrough for Bowie as <i>Space Oddity</i>'s more celebrated title track.</p>
<p>Comparatively, <i>Space Oddity</i>'s other epic set pieces-- the over-orchestrated fable ""The Wild-Eyed Boy From Freecloud"" and hippie-dream requiem ""Memory of a Free Festival""-- are too baroque in their presentation to fully transcend the status of time-capsule curios. But they're still historically significant for introducing Bowie's future foil Mick Ronson, who makes an uncredited appearance on the former, while contributing some six-string muscle to the improved, two-part single version of ""Free Festival"", included on this set's 15-track bonus disc.</p>
<p>A handful of these rarities have surfaced previously-- namely on the 1989 <i>Sound+Vision</i> box set, the 1990 CD reissue of <i>Space Oddity</i> and the 2000 <i>Bowie on the Beeb</i> radio-sessions compilation-- and the set feels excessively padded with (not-so) alternate mixes. But taken together, they illuminate the rapidity of Bowie's evolution between the album's conception and its promotion, from an embryonic demo version of ""Space Oddity"" (sung in a higher register and different meter) to the superior, stripped-down versions of ""An Occasional Dream"" and ""Freecloud"", the Marc Bolan-backed single version of eventual <i>Aladdin Sane</i> track ""The Prettiest Star"" and the proto-Spiders From Mars swagger of ""London Bye Ta-Ta"". And throughout it all, Bowie even found the time to learn another language, cutting a lyrically revised Italian version of ""Space Oddity"" (""Ragazza Solo, Ragazza Sola"") to compete with a wave of successful cover versions in Italy. It 's hardly the most flattering portrait of a man who would go on to sell the world, but still a quaint keepsake from a time when he was just trying to blag his way through mainland Europe.</p></div>"|13610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13610-space-oddity-40th-anniversary-edition/|6.7|Stuart Berman

Chicago party-rapper Kid Sister dropped the breezy nail-salon jam ""Pro Nails"" in spring 2007, and the song went viral when <span class=""misspell"">Kanye</span> West showed up for a superstar cameo. Kid Sister's spent the intervening years recording a debut, scratching it, starting over, tinkering, and finally coming out with the product she really wanted to release. And it's... a 40-minute, 12-track dance-rap full-length without a single hard punchline or trenchant moment, the sort of thing that sounds like it <span class=""misspell"">could've</span> been banged out in a couple of weeks. Turns out this isn't the hipster-rap <i>Detox</i>.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Kid Sis, Sparks-addled party rap has not, as a genre, advanced much since ""Pro Nails"". A number of the tracks on <i>Ultraviolet</i> became blog favorites years ago, but beyond that, the album sounds about as current as it would've if she'd cranked it out in a timely manner. In fact, the record comes considerably less stuffed with ideas than, say, Spank Rock's <i><span class=""misspell"">YoYoYoYoYo</span></i> or <span class=""misspell"">Fannypack's</span> <i>So Stylistic</i>, years-old albums that covered similar stylistic ground but twisted and sputtered and wriggled as much as they <span class=""misspell"">could've</span> without leaving their <span class=""misspell"">dancey</span>, lightweight wheelhouses. Those albums came equipped with a restless, inventive sense of fun. <i>Ultraviolet</i>, for the most part, just sits there.</p>
<p>Production-wise, <i>Ultraviolet</i> is a dance album, not a rap album. The beats, from folks like <span class=""misspell"">XXXchange</span>, <span class=""misspell"">Sinden</span>, and boyfriend/label boss A-<span class=""misspell"">Trak</span>, blow by at frantic but assured clips, picking up and then discarding little melodic ideas as they go. We hear a lot of <span class=""misspell"">ravey</span>, diffuse <span class=""misspell"">synth</span> stabs and compressed Ed <span class=""misspell"">Bangery</span> blurts. ""Big n Bad"" stops just short of jacking Europe's ""Final Countdown"" <span class=""misspell"">synth</span> riff. ""Let Me Bang 2009"" rests on a pretty cloud of keyboards. A few moments of hammy melody call up memories of cheesed-out 90s hi-<span class=""misspell"">NRG</span> Euro-dance, stuff like <span class=""misspell"">Vengaboys</span> or DJ Sammy. But the only time the album's musical palette shifts in any significant way is on ""Switch Board"", where Chicago <span class=""misspell"">juke</span> producer DJ <span class=""misspell"">Gant</span>-Man uses the same ingredients to push a more frantic, furious idea of party-rocking. When Kid Sis and <span class=""misspell"">Gant</span>-Man abandon rapping entirely near the end and resort to barking out dance instructions and party-chants, it's like <i>finally</i>.</p>
<p>Kid Sister is not a great rapper, or even a good one. She spits out all her words with a nasal, scrunched-up, exaggerated pronunciation, the kind of thing that reminds me of actors in teen movies rapping for laughs. When she attempts punchlines, the results are pretty grisly: ""Boy, you got a problem? Holler at Dr. Phil/ I'll put a hurting on ya and I do it in some heels."" She barely stays on top of her beats, and she never switches up her cadences. Lyrically, she rarely steps far outside her favorite subject-- partying-- or even implies that much life exists beyond it. After three tracks of ""yeah, let's dance"", it's almost a relief to her her come with ""Step"", a song about flirting with an overly aggressive dude in a club-- still a song about partying, mind you, but at least a slightly new aspect of it. Kid <span class=""misspell"">Sis's</span> hipster-circuit party-rap has always been a weird and barely acknowledged corner of the rap universe, but the <span class=""misspell"">subgenre's</span> best rappers (Spank Rock's <span class=""misspell"">Naeem</span> <span class=""misspell"">Juwan</span>, for instance) radiate the same intensity that all good rappers do-- the idea that they have to keep rapping or they'll fall to pieces. Kid Sister doesn't have that.</p>
<p>And as she shows on <i>Ultraviolet</i>'s best moment, she doesn't necessarily need to lean on it. My favorite song on the album is the one with no rapping whatsoever. ""You Ain't Really Down"" is an irresistible little piece of freestyle/<span class=""misspell"">electro</span> revisionism, Kid Sis working a surprisingly nimble singing voice over a pinging, bottom-heavy track. Even though she's singing about being heartbroken, there's a fun approachability in her voice, and she <span class=""misspell"">multitracks</span> in some new jack swing backing vocals that remind me of ""<span class=""misspell"">Motownphilly</span>"" more than anything else. An album of Kid Sis singing songs like this might be worth a three-year wait. An album like this one? Not so much.</p></div>"|13684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13684-ultraviolet/|4.4|Tom Breihan

Echoes of No Wave-era noisemakers-- particularly the dogmatic rants of Lydia Lunch's Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and the urgent abstractions of Ut-- were unmistakable. But the duo also has firm roots in the present New York underground, specifically the noise-rock of veteran trio Sightings, whose Richard Hoffman guested on <i>Secret Cog</i>'s best track, ""33"".</p>
<p>Not long after that debut, Talk Normal signed to Rare Book Room Records, enabling them to record their first LP, <i>Sugarland</i>, with producer and label-owner Nicolas Vernhes. This has naturally brought an increase in clarity and detail, but the band's propensity for thick noise and rhythmic tension hasn't waned. In fact, the essential grit and guts of their music have deepened. Songs and lyrics remain simple-- most tracks feature a repetitive beat and blunt statements like ""You had it coming,"" ""Don't shut me down,"" and, aptly enough, ""I believe in structure."" But the way the pair rides these patterns to bracing climaxes is deft and relentless. And their eerie horror-movie tone has grown, approaching the cavernous territory first dug out by the early dirges of Sonic Youth and Swans.</p>
<p>That heavy atmosphere relies on Register's diverse, textured guitar, which is like a muscle stretched across the skeleton of Ambro's beats. She often begins songs with minimal chords, but soon morphs them into layered blare that sounds like Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo inhabiting one body-- or, perhaps more accurately, a multi-dimensional take on Lunch's spraying blasts. On strident pieces like ""In a Strangeland"" and ""Bold Face"", her churning noise matches the duo's coolly desperate howls. Later, her see-sawing treble on ""Transmission Lost"" adds hopeful swing to the call-and-response. And her guitar is the clear star of ""River's Edge"", a kind of ""Death Valley '69"" update that slowly loses its strict beat, indicating the duo can loosen up their rhythmic lock-step when they want to.</p>
<p>In fact, you can hear seeds of expansion on the four tracks that follow ""River's Edge"". ""Uniforms"" offers a raga-like guitar figure; Ambro's drumming on ""Warrior"" has a digital crunch not far from slow-burn IDM; and ""Outside"" features a wiry, scraping saxophone. But it's on <i>Sugarland</i>'s best track-- a cover of Roxy Music's ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache""-- where Talk Normal stretches farthest. Opening with three minutes of beatific synth and half-spoken vocals, the duo follows the original's ultimate line-- ""but you blew my mind""-- not with glam bombast, but muscular, stomping noise. It sounds less like Roxy Music than the Velvet Underground, particularly the moment when Lou Reed used the declaration ""and then my mind split open"" to throw ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" into overdrive. Talk Normal may not yet possess VU-level power, but the fact that they can even evoke such magic practically guarantees a promising future.</p></div>"|13662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13662-sugarland/|7.8|Marc Masters

Like a lush film score, theme for a forgotten Don Johnson TV pilot, or an unused in-house mixtape intended to fill intermission space, <i>Continent</i> at first seems like a throwback record that really opens up only in a specific time and place. And to a degree, that's to be expected coming from a self-professed film geek who is likely keener on the idea of chatting about Cronenberg than Kraftwerk. Michael Silver, the Montreal-based 21-year-old behind CFCF, has garnered a modest following as a producer and prolific remix artist (you might remember him as the guy who won that Crystal Castles remix contest with his ambitious reconfiguring of ""Air War""). And <i>Continent</i>, a surprisingly confident debut, suggests that he's equally concerned with how his music sounds as he is with where it's heard.</p>
<p>As successful as <i>Continent</i> is at evoking mood using deliberate pacing and ripe textures, it also managed to wrap its meticulously pruned pop reticence around everything from hushed poser-disco suites (""Invitation to Love"") to sexy, swoon-struck soft-rock grooves (""Raining Patterns""). Hell, there's even a great Fleetwood Mac cover wedged in there, too. Since it's so easy to lose yourself in these lithe, languid electronic ruminations, it's no wonder that nearly everything I've read about CFCF-- and more specifically <i>Continent</i> itself-- has focused on the cinematic characteristics in Silver's work. But fair may it be to categorize these dozen tracks as a series of very accomplished daydream canvases, <i>Continent</i> becomes a richer experience when looked at as independent of any peripheral distraction, with its pop-friendly attention-grabbers very much in the foreground.</p>
<p>There's a patient, reserved quality at work that will no doubt land <i>Continent</i> a few iPod gigs in chic bistros. But to water down these beat-bolstered two-steppers-- like the propulsive, joyous Mac cover ""Big Love"" or the Quincy Jones-styled funk-out ""Half Dreaming""-- is to rob them of their inherent catchiness and accessibility. Often a little sad or playing to a kind of ethereal, out-of-body vibe, most of the memorable moments here are ones that are felt with the hips, not the head. And that's likely because these are, for the most part, unapologetically svelte tunes jam-packed with cues taken from body-high inducing ambient atmospherics, beatific house loopings, 70s AM Easy Cheese, and bubbly Balearic turns.</p>
<p>All of this might appear indicative of how we spent our 2009 summer vacation (see ""chillwave""), and while there are unmistakable nostalgic underpinnings that help define Silver's music, it's never cloyingly obvious. Where artists like Neon Indian or Washed Out rely on instant gratification to transport a listener back to specific time or feeling, CFCF's music is less concerned with arriving at a discernible destination than it is with detailing the journey. These are lengthy tunes for the most part (a few of the best clocking in well over seven minutes), so it's easy to lose track of every fleeting emotion or quirky little melody that happens to float on by.</p>
<p>Indeed, large parts of <i>Continent</i> may be considered too cautious or circuitous for the casual listener-- Easter eggs like that Prince-in-the-driving-rain guitar solo on ""You Hear Colours"" or the patient, synth-soaked yearning that plays throughout ""Snake Charmer"" might not be able to so readily produce any real effusive payoff for some. However, by employing a bit of listener fortitude, you'll hopefully unlock the vibrancy that lies at <i>Continent</i>'s core and defines it as the sure-footed, elegantly stated electro-pop record it most certainly is.</p></div>"|13648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13648-continent/|7.7|Zach Kelly

Nice title. Nice concept, too. Here's Wayne explaining it, on one of his new <span class=""misspell"">mixtape's</span> blessedly few skits: ""I would love for you to look up into the building and understand that there <i>is</i> no ceilings; there is only the sky."" And in his case, it's true; Wayne's potential greatness seems to have no limit-- or if it does have a limit, it's difficult to say what it might be. Wayne's tough to evaluate because he's so very rarely operating at peak capacity. Whereas a classically great rapper (<i>Ready to Die</i>-era Biggie, say) might hammer his concepts straight on until he's bludgeoned them into atoms, Wayne barely ever <i>has</i> any concepts, hopscotching frantically but lazily between ideas and chasing digressions down gopher holes. <br/><br/>Wayne's digressive, distracted spirit is a huge part of what makes him great; even at his <i>Carter II</i> peak, he was always slippery and unpredictable and defiantly weird. But ever since he indisputably became the most popular rapper in the world last year, he's been in a strange zone, trusting his instincts to the point where he's now preparing to drop a whole album of <span class=""misspell"">somebody's</span> idea of rock on us. And his instincts are, more often than not, bad. Add that to his purportedly staggering drug use and his upcoming prison sentence, and it's tough to tell just how far he could fall. Wayne's got no ceilings, but he's got no floors either.<br/><br/>And given the increasingly scattered nature of his post-<i>Carter III</i> work, the existence of <i>No Ceilings</i> is just a tremendous relief. After last year's wildly disappointing <i>Dedication 3</i>, Wayne's finally back to something like his <i>Dedication 2</i>/<i>Drought 3</i> fighting shape and doing what he does best, swiping beats from all the songs on rap radio and rendering the originals obsolete. Pity F.L.Y. and <span class=""misspell"">Dorrough</span> after what Wayne did to ""Swag <span class=""misspell"">Surfin</span>'"" and ""Ice Cream Paint Job"". Beats like those are where Wayne traditionally comes off best; those cheap, tense, springy synthetic tracks make Wayne's berserk rasp sound something like catharsis. <br/><br/>Wayne's got no compunctions about snatching up a middling regional dance-rap mini-hit, and that appetite serves him well. When you throw him on something busier and bigger-budget like Jay-<span class=""misspell"">Z's</span> ""D.O.A."" or ""Run This Town"", he doesn't sound quite as at home. So it's fortunate that Wayne still has a bug up his ass about Jay. On those two tracks, he just goes absolutely <span class=""misspell"">ripshit</span>, throwing slick <span class=""misspell"">subliminals</span> at Jay or just laughing Jay's barbs off. At least on <span class=""misspell"">mixtapes</span>, Wayne doesn't have Jay's drive to build eternal monuments to his own importance; he's free to just <span class=""misspell"">spazz</span> out. So, on ""Run This Town"": ""New Orleans Coroner, his name is Frank <span class=""misspell"">Minyard</span>/ Fuck with me wrong, you'll be waking up in his yard."" (A Google search confirms that New Orleans' Coroner is indeed named Frank <span class=""misspell"">Minyard</span>. Wayne: Backing up his insane threats with verifiable facts!)<br/><br/>In some intriguing ways, the rise of Gucci Mane presents an interesting challenge to this sort of Wayne <span class=""misspell"">mixtape</span>. Gucci represents an evolution of Wayne's free-associative style, one simultaneously spacier and more focused. Gucci has none of Wayne's cursory desire for acceptance from NY true-<span class=""misspell"">schoolers</span>, and he favors the kind of dinky, catchy budget beats that Wayne loves stealing on tapes like these. Wayne raps over three Gucci tracks on <i>No Ceilings</i>, as well as one from Gucci associate <span class=""misspell"">Waka</span> <span class=""misspell"">Flocka</span>, but he doesn't treat these tracks like challenges the way he does with the Jay songs. He probably should, since the Gucci songs are the rare <span class=""misspell"">mixtape</span> tracks where Wayne can't erase the memory of the originals.<br/><br/>And <i>No Ceilings</i> certainly has its problems. Wayne might never again sound as flat-out committed as he did on <i>Dedication 2</i>. His punchlines don't always carry the same impact, and he's more likely to laugh at his own jokes. He shares valuable mic time with tolerable nonentities like <span class=""misspell"">Lucci</span> Lou and <span class=""misspell"">Gudda</span> <span class=""misspell"">Gudda</span>. He picks a few tracks like the Black Eyed Peas' ""I Gotta Feeling"", songs that just aren't conducive to great rapping. He swipes a few terrible sex-rap tracks and makes slightly less terrible sex-rap tracks out of them, though even those will dependably include a few appealingly loony lines (""I get it wetter than bass pussy"" is supposed to be seductive?). He's not quite the animal he was.<br/><br/>But <i>No Ceilings</i> once again finds Wayne in total control of beats, motivated and sliding freely between ideas. He pronounces ""alps"" and ""stealth"" and ""<span class=""misspell"">milf</span>"" like they all rhyme with each other. He's scatological: ""I'm on some shit ain't even been out the ass yet."" He's haughty: ""Elevator in my crib cause it's five floors/ I'm not expecting you to have one inside yours."" He's on his half-<span class=""misspell"">sensical</span> pop culture shit: ""I get big chips; you get <span class=""misspell"">Alvins</span>."" He's capable of coming up with lines that get stuck in your head for no conceivable reason: ""I'm flyer than the highest flying bird around this ho."" He's frankly disgusting: ""I made the pussy <span class=""misspell"">gleek</span>."" And with the twin trials of prison and <i>Rebirth</i> looming, it's just enormously gratifying to hear that he still knows how to rap, that he loves doing it. After all, nobody does it like him.</p></div>"|13672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13672-no-ceilings/|7.7|Tom Breihan

Then, of course, there's Robert Pollard. With his Boston Spaceships and at least one fine solo offering, Bob's been having a kickass 2009. But you're forgiven if you're still poring over his even more kickass 1993; there's simply so much to listen to, and more all the time.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, <i>Suitcase 3</i>, Pollard's latest 100-song foray into the mythical valise-cum-vault that contains Pollard's unreleased material. These <i>Suitcase</i> sets, obviously, have been mixed bags, flitting between fidelities and vintages and bit players with little rhyme or reason and with even less consistency than your typical Pollard 28-songer. The third time out's much the same, with 75 cuts seemingly chosen and arranged at random (credited, in trademark Pollard style, to fake bands with names like Kelsey Boo Flip, Heartthrob Johnson Firestone, Erotic Zip Codes and the like) followed by an off-the-cuff demo session from the particulary fertile <i>Bee Thousand</i>/<i>Alien Lanes</i> era. It's a neat trick, really, doing it this way; though the first three-quarters of the set will almost instantly be relegated into every Bob fan's random shuffle, the last disc's total fanperson catnip, the basement of Indie Rock Valhalla, that sort of thing. At least on paper.</p>
<p>It's true that going through the first three discs of <i>Suitcase 3</i> front-to-back isn't too far off from typing Guided by Voices into the search bar in iTunes and just letting it fly, for a couple reasons: jumping from a filthy <i>Vampire on Titus</i> track to a frothy <i>Do the Collapse</i> and almost everything changes: sonics, approach to hooks, song length, and personnel. There's no organizing principle that I can discern in <i>Suitcase 3</i>; a beat-up little banger from the early days sits next to stately late-era sweep, and back-and-forth it goes. There's an emphasis on the gnarly yet hooky mid-90s stuff, and even a few all-too-fleeting nods to the era; ""Coastal Town"" shares a few moves with <i>Alien Lanes</i>' ""Closer You Are"" and ""Old Engine Driver"" is a slightly different spin on ""Hey Aardvark"" from the sorta-classic <i>Static Airplane Jive</i> EP. You get drunken, silly Pollard (""You Gotta Lotta Nerve""), stoner metalworker Pollard (""Psychlophobia""), not-taking-more-time-to-record-this-than-it-did-to-write Pollard (""Take Me Back"", among so many others); all the Pollards, really.</p>
<p>But even if one focuses on the good stuff, the sheer volume of this thing means that these first three discs to overwhelm. Something like ""Janet Wait"", a ruddy, barely-hanging-on ballad, is as fucking sad and gorgeous a drunk's lament as this guy's ever given us (no, really). It's just a shame it'd be so easy to miss, floating in a sea of middling half-sketches and neural misfires here. I mean, were the suitcase being used for its intended purpose, at this point we'd be down to black socks and sandals, and maybe that emergency bathing suit.</p>
<p>Which I reckon goes some way toward explaining why the fourth disc falls far short of expectations. The very existence of a bunch of unheard demos from the pinnacle of one of indie rock's greatest bands seems the equivalent of a Gary Young version of <i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i> or something. What if there's another ""Echos Myron"" waiting in the wings? But Bob's been through this stuff a few times already, so if it was really something to hear, we probably would've heard it. And, as it turns out, these sessions really couldn't be more off-the-cuff. Everybody seems a little drunk and a lot worn out, several songs don't even attempt an ending, and at one point someone wanders down to the basement to chatter as the tape rolls.</p>
<p>Sure, there's at least one great scrap of Pollardiania to be had-- the acoustic intro to ""Tractor Rape Chain"" is here, in full, as ""South Rat Observatory""-- but there's also more than enough long stretches of random strumming and Bob grasping for lyrical straws. The last bit of <i>Suitcase</i> does offer some insights into Pollard's process-- turns out, for all the jokes, the guy's not exactly shitting gold, nor was he ever-- but once the voyeuristic glee of being a fly on the wall while a bunch of cool dudes get loaded and write some rock songs wear off, you're not left with a whole lot.</p>
<p>That is, until you start moving things around. The first three discs of <i>Suitcase</i> suffer from a lack of cohesion; the fourth, from far too much of it. Mix it up a little bit more, though, and you've got playlist padding and mixtape fodder and shuffly stuff for days. That relatively little of it could stand next to Bob's best isn't really the point; this is the bottom of the baggage, so to speak, and its far-flung nature and relative lack of quality control make it one just for the superfans. But that lot's hardly going to mind 100 new and newish GBV jams to have and hold in their own vaults. When you really need it, it's good to have a little extra on hand.</p></div>"|13681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13681-suitcase-3-up-we-go-now/|5.3|Paul Thompson

<p class=""MsoNormal"">But 50's nothing if not calculating, and while <i>Before I Self Destruct </i>might not be designed to reach the pretty impressive first week sales of <i>Curtis, </i>it may be a wiser move making it to appeal to listener who still might be rooting for the guy. <span> </span>In other words, the sort of guy who thought ""Blood Hound"" and ""Back Down"" were by far the best tracks from <i>Get Rich  or Die Tryin'</i>.<span> </span>It's transparent pandering on the level of ""Amusement Park"", but the difference is that 50 still can rap convincingly about his financial power moves whereas every bit of sexual pursuit simply bores him to death-- he can't even really make a love song about his guns these days (see ""Hold Me Down"").</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">He's still got that voice, and when he wants, it can still intoxicate and overwhelm with sheer menace. ""The Invitation"" and ""Death to My Enemies"" snarl with a ferocity that's refreshing in the context of 50's recent output as well as the current hip-pop landscape where meat'n'potatoes gangsta is actually kinda novel.<span> </span>He disarmingly sings along with the Jackson 5 sample that begins ""Then Days Went By"" before reshaping his ""Hate It or Love It"" verse into a squalid blaxploitation that makes you think he'd view <i>Precious </i>as a comedy.<span> </span>There's the part where a trip to the South turns into a murder spree and he pistol-whips his drug-addled uncle, but it's his staggering anti-romance that provides the most creepy shock: ""she was 20, I was 12/ Nana said she raped me/ I just smiled ear to ear saying 'take it, baby, take it.'""<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As good as the ruffneck stuff generally is, he's way more entertaining when he's fucking around with people.<span> </span>On that note, ""So Disrespectful"" is the most successful track, in that it'll be the one that gets talked about.<span> </span>We can argue about the moral implications of using other people's serious problems as comic fodder, but 50 has no such use for that.<span> </span>He starts off using the Game's claims of sexual molestation against him and just goes from there, railing on anonymous hangers-on and, most comprehensively, former ally Young Buck: ""tell momma he done smoked the TV/ I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G.""<span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><i><span> </span></i><span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A production team including Dr. Dre, <span> </span>Rick Rock, and Polow Da Don ensure that the cold and clinical Aftermath sonic architecture constantly allows <i>Before </i>to reek of amorality and fuck-you money.<span> </span>It's apt since you could make the argument that <i>Before </i>is something of a concept album portraying human relations in purely transactional terms-- it's not called a ""social contract"" for nothing.<span> </span>There's genuine hurt residing deep within a lot of the tracks here, but nearly every time, it's rendered financially and finds 50 going from playful to extremely bitter as the album goes on.<span> </span>Regarding the dissolution of G-Unit, he jokes ""keeping these motherfuckers rich ain't easy,"" but later, ""Strong Enough"" becomes one of the angriest tracks he's done in years. On ""So Disrespectful"", even his absentee father is seen as a drain on his bank account: ""I don't even know him/ So now the fuck I owe him?""<span> </span>If there's any line that could serve as <i>Before</i>'s thesis statement, it's this song's closer: ""Enemies stay enemies/ But friends they change/ Niggas go crazy over money.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But the fun of talking about the record overstates its actual quality. After initially promising a return to form, 50 doesn't have the ability or initiative to hold the listener's interest over the long run.<span> </span>The middle bogs down in post-<i>2001 </i>Aftermath muddle and by the second half, he's back trying to make would-be hits again without the inevitability. It's almost like even he's unsure of his hitmaking abilities, and in a weird way, that sorta softens him.<span> </span>But who really wants that?<span> </span>The eyeball-scorching <i>Terminator </i>cover becomes apt-- its creators wanted to have it seen as humanizing allegory, but the consumer just wants to see a remorseless killing machine in action.</p></div>"|13700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13700-before-i-self-destruct/|6.0|Ian Cohen

Not only have the band lived to see their fourth album-- while other post-Libertines peers like the Others and the View get cast aside like so much <i>NME</i> roadkill-- their chart placements keep going up; <i>Ignore the Ignorant</i> recently hit No. 8 in the UK. And the band have been equally successful at turning its heroes into collaborators; having previously enlisted the services of everyone from Bobby Conn and Orange Juice's Edwyn Collins to Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos and Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo, the Cribs are now living out the ultimate indie pop fantasy-camp dream by recruiting Smiths guitar hero Johnny Marr as a full-fledged official fourth member. That development may seem less staggering given Marr's recent Modest Mouse tenure, but while the guitarist was absorbed into that band's backwoods art-funk framework, the crystalline guitar pop heard on <i>Ignore the Ignorant</i>-- produced by Public Image Ltd./Birthday Party vet Nick Launay-- leaves little doubt as to who's taking cues from whom.   <br/><br/>Marr's presence is immediately felt on opening track ""We Were Aborted"", which fills in the spaces between the Cribs' usual staccato-riff schematic with counter-melodies that give the song more room to breathe without sacrificing its pressurized thrust, rendering it a distant British cousin to the Foo Fighters' ""Everlong"". This transformative process-- from post-punky pub-rockers to graceful pop songsmiths-- plays out all through <i>Ignore the Ignorant</i>, though not without its growing pains. As a band fond of naming indie rock influences that are several degrees more idiosyncratic than the music they actually produce, the Cribs are prone to hampering their songs' increasingly dignified presentations with screaming; the hoarse chorus howls on gleaming lead single ""Cheat on Me"" feel overly melodramatic, and the circa-1963 slow dance reverie of ""Save Your Secrets"" is upended by a lumbering, overwrough
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
t middle eight that feels like it barged in from another song. The six-minute anomaly ""City of Bugs"", meanwhile, sees the Cribs stretching out into nocturnal, Sonic Youthian terrain, but despite Ryan Jarman's best attempts at Thurston Moore-like sing-speak, the song just feels like an excuse to unleash some string-snapping guitar squall.<br/><br/><i>Ignore the Ignorant</i> fares much better when the Cribs keep their contrarian tendencies in check and remind themselves that, ""holy shit, we've got Johnny fucking Marr in our band!"" Compared to Morrissey's oblique but resonant lyricism, the Jarmans deal in provocative sound-bite slogans (e.g., ""your virility has made me forget empathy""), but the Cribs prove themselves worthy successors to a lineage of cheekily erudite Britpop that spans David Bowie (see: the ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"" sway of ""Stick to Yr Guns"") through to the Smiths ( the ""Panic""-style swing of the title track) to Pulp (the rather excellent ""We Share the Same Skies"", a shot of organ-swathed jangle-pop urgency would fit snugly on <i>His 'n' Hers</i>). And in the jubilant Jam-ready rocker ""Victim of Mass Production"", the Cribs seem to finally accept their status as a pop commodity beholden to the ""powers that be."" They might never acquire the iconoclastic cool of a Sonic Youth, but a Top 10 fate is certainly one they can live with, because, as the Jarmans sing in unison, ""we're not supposed to be here anyway.""</p></div>"|13709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13709-ignore-the-ignorant/|7.0|Stuart Berman

What tends to get lost in this sparsely arranged music, particularly when we're dealing with lesser artists and total hacks, is color and atmosphere. Without these things, songs can feel incredibly clinical and soulless-- throbbing grooves almost completely devoid of context. Little Dragon, a quartet from Gothenburg, Sweden, are not entirely removed from the electro and modern R&amp;B influences of their time, but their arrangements make a point of foregrounding ambiance and texture. Whereas too many post-Timbaland, post-electroclash records can seem like sentences stripped of adjectives and proper nouns, the tones on the group's sophomore album <i>Machine Dreams</i> suggest complex emotions and vivid scenery with exquisite detail.</p>
<p>The emphasis on atmosphere is made clear from the very start of <i>Machine Dreams</i>, as album opener ""A New"" begins and ends with electronic drones, as if to bracket the song in ellipses like an unfinished thought. The subsequent song, ""Looking Glass"", is firmer, more beat-driven, but as much as its groove is steady, as a whole it seems to wander. Motion and physicality is strongly implied by the rhythm, but the leisurely pace and subtly shifting keyboard tones indicate changes in setting, evoking a sense that we're stumbling around lost in some strange, beautiful city. This sets the tone for the rest of the album, which goes off on the tangents of different rhythms into other textural zones, but maintains a feeling of searching around for something, whether it is a person, a destination, a state of mind, or the right words to express some ineffable thought.</p>
<p>Little Dragon's palette is broad enough to lend the album a rich, luscious sound, but specific enough to ground the work in a particular time and place, though the definition of both terms is left to the listener's imagination. Some of the songs, like ""Looking Glass"" and ""My Step"", sound like a 1980s version of the future, and owe a debt to the keyboard aesthetics of freestyle and Prince circa <i>Sign 'O' the Times</i>. Others, like the gorgeous ballad ""Feather"" and the claustrophobic ""Thunder Love"", bring to mind the dystopian sexiness of Tricky's early classics on <i>Maxinquaye</i> and <i>Pre-Millennium Tension</i>. Yukimi Nagano, the band's charismatic Swedish-Japanese vocalist, has a smokey yet agile voice, and it serves as the anchor of each song. She avoids melisma, but her phrasing is in the general wheelhouse of modern R&amp;B, particularly British iterations of the genre. As with every other element of their sound, Nagano's voice places Little Dragon's music in a lineage of recognizable influences under a vague ""urban"" umbrella, but it all comes out just a bit off, which is to say, unexpected and original.</p>
<p><i>Machine Dreams</i> is at once familiar and slightly alien, and the emotional center is both intuitively obvious and intentionally vague. Nagano is the type of writer and singer who lets her words roughly sketch out a feeling that she embellishes with her voice. This approach puts more faith in the unique effects of music-- there is no sense in being direct and literal when singing can convey the sort of nuance that is almost impossible to express in other forms of communication. The album falters slightly when the music becomes more abstract and inscrutable, but on the whole it is not difficult to relate to Nagano or slip into the mood created by her bandmates. That mood is slippery and hard to define, but that's not so much a problem as it is part of the appeal, as the band navigate the strange spaces between big, easily identifiable emotions.</p></div>"|13701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13701-machine-dreams/|7.7|Matthew Perpetua

So she and guitarist Nick Zinner thought of a band name and a logo before they had written any songs, as they reveal on one of this album's interview tracks. After they'd written some (very good) songs, their reputations-- Nick Zinner's cool, Karen O's beer-soaked bravado-- still preceded their records. But then YYYs released ""Maps"". Then they became less fashionable but no less good. And they matured, even before Karen O did the most New York thing of all: move to L.A.</p>
<p>This iTunes collection spans from their first EP to <i>Its Blitz!</i>, and it shows a band willing to adapt and change without regrets or nostalgia for its past. That YYYs are ready to have a greatest hits album pangs their older fans more than the band themselves. They don't hate getting older, or ever being that young.</p>
<p>That's most apparent from their choices and interviews here, beginning with an acoustic version of their debut EP's ""Our Time"". Abrupt and bluesy, clunky and amateur, it's also got a swagger that none of their subsequent songs matches-- not that the band wants them to. By their debut LP, YYYs were already a different band. ""I was feeling a little bit more aversion to the more rockish, noisy, kinda histrionic vocals, because I wasn't relating to it as a 27-year-old or 26-year-old as well as I did when I was 21 or 22,"" Karen O explained to Pitchfork in an interview. ""And I felt like the angst fizzled out when we were writing this album, and it was more kinda like a brewing sort of... I don't know what it was."" So ""Our Time""'s makeover is YYYs' makeover.</p>
<p>Three of the five acoustic versions are from <i>It's Blitz</i>: ""Runaway"", which Karen describes as ""epic"" in one of the iTunes interviews, melts into a torch song, while ""Hysteric"" takes on a spacious, ponderous quality that its spare melody barely supports. Breaking from the cliché of the solemn acoustic version, <i>It's Blitz!</i>'s ""Dull Life"" becomes an even better stomper, one that, as Karen O says in her interview still has ""that YYYs energy.""</p>
<p>The interview portions are far too short, and even shorter than you think, since the band hem when explaining their songs. Karen O ends her answers in a trailing, adolescent ""so...."" But what's fascinating is their phrase ""that YYYs energy."" This attitude is exactly what's kept them sane, and kept them good. Since YYYs define themselves not in terms of a particular sound or instrumentation, but rather ""energies,"" the supposed leaps they've made-- from sweaty punk band to doe-eyed balladeers to electronic pied pipers-- really seem like iterations of the same band, different outfits on the same body.</p>
<p>This may be what they mean when they hope to be, ""bigger than the sound,"" as Karen O sings on their rousing ""Cheated Hearts"" (here in its original form). Other songs (""Y Control"", ""Gold Lion"", ""Down Boy"", ""Heads Will Roll"") appear in their original versions. Their best song here and everywhere else, is still ""Maps"", a song that's come to stand for YYYs in a way that transcends even a ""signature song""--more than a hit, it's bound to the band DNA. They back up Zinner's acoustic guitar with violins as they did for their Radio City Music Hall gig. Writing it was, as Karen O says, ""a moment in time for us.""</p>
<p>A ""moment in time"" for them, for their fans. But this collection includes YYYs singles too familiar to be worth re-purchasing. As Tom Breihan said, all the acoustic versions can be purchased separately via iTunes for $5.25. When you price music by the song, you start to think cost per track; and in this case the product only justifies the price if this is your first YYYs album. Ever.</p>
<p>That said, the interviews are worth it, though the band can't talk about themselves for any length. You really do have to marvel at Karen O, though. In her 2005 interview with <i>The Believer</i>, she said, ""I'm fully putting myself out there for the people and for the sake of trying to lure them into the experience and out of... detachment."" It's the sort of platitude you expect from a front woman of Karen O's consummate skill and charisma, and yet it's her sheer ability as a communicator and perpetual optimist that is the real source of YYYs ""energy.""</p></div>"|13646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13646-itunes-originals/|7.0|Jessica Suarez

This rationale is the only way I can account for the fact that the Stones' best-regarded live release, 1970's definitely pleasurable but less-than-transcendent <i>Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!</i>, routinely places highly on lists of the best concert documents in rock history. It feels like the kind of perfunctory acknowledgment that virtually all of the other typically high-ranking sets (for instance, Neil Young's <i>Live Rust</i>, the Who's <i>Live at Leeds, a</i>nd the Allman Brothers Band's <i>At Fillmore East</i>) don't need, seeing as how they're genuinely awesome.</p>
<p>Live performance never seemed as intrinsic to the Rolling Stones' essence as it did for most of 60s and 70s rock's other heavy hitters. Sure, as soon as playing basketball arenas became a viable rock-star option the always-avaricious Stones rushed to embrace the financial potentialities, but the group's music never cultivated the kind of epic, transformative breadth that best fills an enormous space like Madison Square Garden, where <i>Ya-Ya's</i> was recorded. Big venues demand that everything else be larger than life as well, but outsized song lengths (think the Grateful Dead, Allmans, Led Zep), outsized emotions (the Who, U2), and outsized spectacle (KISS, David Bowie) have never been indispensable components of the Stones' music. It's not for nothing that some of the band's most cherished officially sanctioned live work happens to be the El Mocambo club stuff from 1977's <i>Love You Live</i> as well as 1995's intimate <i>Stripped</i>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <i>Ya-Ya's</i> persists as the Stones' go-to concert recording, so it's hardly a surprise to see the band now putting out a deluxe, 3xCD/DVD reissue of the two-night event. Unfortunately, as a purchasable product, this $60-retailing set ($41.99 on Amazon) is damn near felonious. Disc One is the original album itself, remastered, though keep in mind it was already given the SACD treatment in 2002. Disc Two is a grand total of five tracks-- recordings of the tracks the Stones played those two nights that didn't make the album proper. Disc Three is material from opening acts B.B. King and Ike and Tina Turner, and ironically enough it may the part of the box that's most worth getting excited about-- particularly the devastating way Tina digs into Otis Redding's classic ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"". Disc Four is a DVD, which seems pretty enticing until you realize it only captures performances of the same five songs that were on Disc Two. Why, at the very least, a disc couldn't have been assembled that put the songs in the order in which they were actually originally played is beyond me.</p>
<p>Now, by denigrating this <i>Ya-Ya's</i> reissue as a commodity and by questioning the album's canonization in general, I don't mean to imply this set doesn't cook. Even if it's not larded with 20-minute workouts, <i>Ya-Ya's</i> is manna for guitar freaks, thanks to the fiery interplay between the immortal Keith Richards and inarguably the greatest lead guitarist the Stones ever boasted, Mick Taylor. ""Under My Thumb"" and ""Live with Me"" feature wondrously rejiggered riffs, while ""Love in Vain"", ""Street Fighting Man"", and ""Sympathy for the Devil"" soar with brilliant solos (two solos in the case of ""Sympathy""). Rhythmically, the whole set (aside from a two-song acoustic blues interlude) coagulates into one long, sweaty, irresistible throb.</p>
<p>All that said, the fault for <i>Ya-Ya's</i> falling just short of the Pantheon must then lie at the feet of Mick Jagger. In the studio, Jagger has always had time and takes to work a wealth of subtle ironic nuances into his readings, but Madison Square Garden isn't the place for nuance. As the Stones became less sexy and stylish in the 80s, Jagger's routine grew more goofily athletic, and the gigantic football stadiums the band preferred were perfect conduits for his crowd-pleasing mugging and gymnastics. In 1969, however, image and venue failed to mesh, and Jagger just seems to lack fire and imagination, aside from lasciviously dropping the age of the sexually uncaged teenage girl in ""Stray Cat Blues"" from Beggars Banquet's 15 to the Roman Polanski-approved 13. For the most part, however, Jagger fails to recognize that this was the band's moment, and that unawareness of <i>Ya-Ya's</i> epochal promise is the primary thing that keeps the album from truly belonging alongside the preeminent aural snapshots in rock history.</p></div>"|13675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13675-get-yer-ya-yas-out-the-rolling-stones-in-concert-40th-anniversary-deluxe-box-set/|5.4|Joshua Love

Released when microhouse's delicate sound-sculpting was being touted as dance music's future, and strangely first claimed by electroclash fans during that trend's brief and ignoble peak, Vitalic offered speaker-frying synth-riffs (or sometimes just synth-<i>squeals</i>) to scare off wannabe aesthetes and IDM refugees, reaffirming the productive struggle in post-acid dance between funk and floor-clearing noise. But as ""Poney Part 1"" and ""La Rock"" reared their ugly heads again and again, showing up on one compilation after another during the next three years with little <i>new</i> Vitalic material in sight, fans who valued humor and nuance as much as focused brutality may have wondered if producer Pascal Arbez had exhausted his one distortion-drenched trick.</p>
<p>So it probably helped Vitalic's long-term career prospects that his 2005 debut album, <i>OK Cowboy</i>, included enough oddities (like ""Wooo"", with John Carpenter subbing for the oompah band at a local polka night) and slow jams (like ""The Past"", a rare non-unctuous trawl through 1980s synth-pop romanticism) to keep John and Jane Doe from tuning out after the 10th consecutive helping of fuck-you. Which is not to say Monsieur Arbez wussed out in the name of crossing over. The fearsome ""Poney""-alikes far outweighed the goofball interludes, and if he'd released his second LP 12 months later, his rep as middlebrow dance music's premier scourge would have been secured. Instead, another three years passed between <i>OKC</i> and <i>Flashmob</i>, a period during which a horde of noisy, uncouth producers (many of them fellow Frenchmen in the Ed Banger orbit) popped up, turning overblown feedback and digital grime into exhausting shtick in record time. With the landscape glutted with punk-dance nobodies, Vitalic's mission-- to create deranged, over-the-top dance music that nonetheless honors disco's body-moving tradition-- became that much harder.</p>
<p>If he succeeds, and <i>Flashmob</i> proves that he does, it's because Vitalic's best productions have a near-psychedelic sweep, a sensuous appreciation for the way he can overlap often grating textures until they become both beguiling and disorienting, while so many of his contemporaries are happy to strangle the details right out of their tracks with volume. Even if he's unerringly loud, his weakness for buzzsaw mid-range obliterating the dub-influenced sense of space you hear in the best minimal and deep house, Vitalic offers sublime, spaced-out moments as crucial punctuation in even his least compromising tracks. Opener ""See the Sea (Red)"" is undeniably dominated by the fat, fuzzed-out riff that takes the place of a traditional bassline, but Arbez knows said riff will flatten listeners all the harder when it rears back up after a twinkly, almost Kompakt-ian breakdown. Justice, by contrast, would just let the riff build and build until you're begging for relief that never comes. Arbez obviously appreciates this no-mercy approach, but realizes that what's effective on a lone 12"" gets wearying when repeated a dozen times in an hour.</p>
<p>This contrast-- between short moments of catch-your-breath beauty and the violence of riffs on the edge of pure noise-- has proven to be Vitalic's greatest weapon. Perhaps that's why <i>Flashmob</i>'s slower, more even-keeled tracks feel like filler. <i>Necessary </i>filler, but nonetheless. ""Poison Lips"" is fine as post-Italo/hi-NRG pastiche goes, but it's too streamlined, too emotionally flat to feel like anything other than an interlude that got out of hand. Ditto ""Allan Dellon"" and its slow-motion electro-house, where Vitalic proves he can do straight-up, classically synth-driven beauty well enough, while lacking the melodrama of <i>Flashmob</i>'s obvious highs.</p>
<p>But you also sense that Arbez knows these tracks are glorified breathers, and has sequenced the album very carefully. For instance, following the relatively low-key and carefully sculpted vocoders of ""See the Sea (Blue)"" with ""Chicken Lady"", <i>Flashmob</i>'s most unrepentantly thuggish moment-- three minutes of Arbez dragging his knuckles around his studio as his melody-spurning machines groan and growl. Taken individually, neither is a jaw-dropper, but in tandem they mimic the one-two punch of his best work. Little of <i>Flashmob</i> could be described as ""tender,"" or even traditionally catchy, but Arbez has enough of a pop instinct to know that drama results only from careful pacing. He also knows that when you're making big, potentially dumb, and definitely unruly dance music, a sense of humor and a lack of pretension is crucial. It's hard not to laugh when a robot tells you, ""This is your disco song, made for you, for those rain days, to chase the shadows away,"" over a backdrop of mock-menacing see-sawing synth-grind.</p>
<p>That's why the best track here is ""Terminateur Benelux""; it squeezes everything Vitalic does well into four minutes, a summary of <i>Flashmob</i>'s well-crafted, winking brutalism and my pick for a single-serving download for the curious. It's hilarious and a little terrifying all at once, an unhinged homage to early-90s hardcore rave, with a clattering quasi-breakbeat that sounds like it's agitated itself into a fit, sampled ""woo!""s and ""ah-ha!""s straight off a 2 Bad Mice single, and the kind of freaky Belgian techno drone-riff that's probably ground zero for Vitalic's sonic signature. Listening, you don't know whether to giggle, run for cover, or start breakdancing. Like those first-wave rave producers, Arbez wants to have it all: to make listeners smile, shake their shit, and still walk away a little shaken by the music's intensity. <i>Flashmob</i> pulls off this near-impossible combo with more skill than even Vitalic's fans may have expected.</p></div>"|13704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13704-flashmob/|7.9|Jess Harvell

In an era when everything's preserved for posterity within a few minutes of it happening, the live album seems a particularly antiquated artifact, despite the prevalence of the things in the marketplace (this is, after all, not the only live record Pitchfork is reviewing today). <i>Rock in Dodelijk</i>, however, avoids a lot of what makes the live album seem superfluous, thanks to the band's breathless, ripchord performance and the set's searing up-front sound.</p>
<p><i>Dodelijk</i> blasts off with the snidely whiplash of ""Hi How Are You?"", that great bite-sized kiss off from the band's 2005 debut, <i>Give Blood</i>. It's a perfect attention-grabber, and Brakes knock out all its right angles with aplomb. Brakes trade in the kind of zippy, word-forward, world-weary Britrock of Arctic Monkeys or Art Brut, almost unfailingly sarcastic, as much about inflection as the words spewing from singer Eamon Hamilton's mouth. As such, a live album's a trickier proposition for Brakes than most, as the post-punky precision of the music and all that shit Hamilton talks have to fall in line just so for the whole thing to work. But Brakes have that covered-- they sound beefier here than on record, with some of the nervous energy from the studio converted into pure heft onstage. Lead guitarist Tom White, in particular, lets loose with some billowy solos given far more room to unfurl in front of the audience. As they slide from one tune to another, hardly a scrap of banter or even a few seconds' respite to be had, Brakes' blinders-on, frills-free rock feels taut, terse, and immediate; <i>Dodelijk</i> might be culled from a couple of different shows, each at least six months old, but it sounds a lot more like last night's PA mix still rattling around in your head. Kudos to producers Paul Savage and Ric Peet, who, by minimizing crowd noise and pushing Hamilton way up front, lend this thing a real immediacy.</p>
<p>The setlist largely sticks to tunes from their first and still best album, <i>Give Blood</i>, and it's here we find our highlights: silly little country ditty ""NY Pie"", name-drop nose-turner ""Heard About Your Band"", single-that-wasn't ""What's in It For Me?"" As with their studio sets, punky thrashabouts sit comfortably next to twangy tear-in-my-many-beers ditties. The already apparent holes in some of the Brakes' tunes, which at their worst can seem little more than a stutter from Hamilton and a steady scrape from the band, do pop up occasionally; then again, they rarely overstay their welcome, as <i>Dodelijk</i> sneaks 20 tunes into just shy of 45 minutes, and in a way even help the good stuff kick harder in contrast.</p></div>"|13698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13698-rock-is-dodelijk/|7.0|Paul Thompson

But there was a surprise harbinger in that album, a song that my original review actually completely overlooked due to-- or maybe despite-- a stripped-down, ambient eeriness that offset the rest of the album's aggro-beat feel. That song was ""You &amp; Me"", a strikingly delicate yet powerful collaboration with the soft-voiced singer/poet Roger Robinson. And about three months after <i>London Zoo </i>dropped, the creative partnership of Robinson and producer Kevin Martin brought forth a deservedly lauded single under the name King Midas Sound: the ghostly ""Cool Out"", which rivaled the best of Burial when it came to the more desolate corners of dubstep.</p>
<p>One year later, ""Cool Out"" has reemerged as the lead track off the first King Midas Sound full-length, and it's retained its impact-- assuming you can refer to the feeling of becoming slowly enveloped in abandoned-high-rise ambiance and serenaded by quivering, sweetly voiced murmurs as an impact. It also stands as one of the highlights of <i>Waiting for You</i>, or at least one of the most chilling moments; the fact that this album can conflate the two is a sure sign of where it's coming from. Every strength this record holds draws off the symbiotic relationship between Martin's beats and Robinson's voice, which adapt to each other in a way that the last two people in a barren environment might. This is dub production rendered as the final reverberations of a deserted cityscape, infused with a crumbling low-end that does for bass what a single fluorescent tube in an underground concrete tunnel does for light. And the voice decorates it like a spiderweb-- fragile in appearance, but structurally resilient enough to hold strong against the rhythm.</p>
<p>Robinson's singing sells his idea of zero-gravity lovers' rock like a champ, filling in the evocative cracks that his mostly straightforward lyrics don't do much to cover. The title track's lovesick sentiments are familiar, but there's this pang to his voice-- a bit disbelieving, bitter, hopeful and agonized all at once-- that holds the deeper meaning. And he's just as powerful on the other songs where he's called upon to invoke that lonely brooding atmosphere-- ""One Ting"" (sonically bleaker than the nano-orchestral lavishness of Dabrye's remix from the ""Cool Out"" 12""); the misty-eyed take-me-back begging of ""Darlin'""; ""Meltdown"" and its heavy-sighing pleads for intimacy. Robinson does have an intriguing vocal counterpart on a few tracks in the person of Dokkeki Q member Kiki Hitomi, at her ethereally malicious best on ""Goodbye Girl"" delivering spiteful reprimands and Elvis Costello quotes with a scalpel's agility (""I wish you pain 'til you can't ever feel joy/ I wish you luck with a capital F, boy""). But the more remote and abandoned Robinson's aching voice sounds, the heavier it hits.</p>
<p>Not all of <i>Waiting for You </i>has that same ambiance, though it rarely rises above the level of a soft rumble. Martin's production forgoes the stereotypical dubstep war of bassbin attrition to let the beats glow instead of flash, and even when it approaches an actual heavy knock-- like the underwater dancehall bump of ""Outta Space"" or the smothered Mantronix boom-clap of ""I Man""-- it still resembles the starker moments of <i>Mezzanine-</i>era Massive Attack more than it does something along the lines of Bug tracks like ""Skeng"" or ""Warning"". Still, a little something is lost when things digress from the cutting isolation that made ""Cool Out"" work, especially when Robinson breaks from his singing to issue scoffing spoken-word holistic reprimands on ""Earth a Kill Ya""-- a decent bit of preaching with a heavy scowl of a beat beneath, but oddly harsh and self-assured on a record that thrives on sounding vulnerable.</p></div>"|13616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13616-waiting-for-you/|7.6|Nate Patrin

This is a tricky proposition. And, so far, a successful one. This summer's self-titled debut album from the Glaswegian singer and songwriter's God Help the Girl project brought together a fine cast of female vocalists, led by Catherine Ireton, for girl group- and musical theater-leaning songs centered around some longtime B&amp;S preoccupations: sex, religion, pop. The five-song <i>Stills</i> EP, as its name and format suggest, plays more like a collection of scattered moments than a full-length motion picture.</p>
<p>The best of these snapshots comes with the EP's heartbroken title track and centerpiece. As on much of God Help the Girl's LP, we're in Anne Murray or Karen Carpenter territory here-- the kind of soft, melodic, adult pop once derided as ""Happy Housewives' Music""-- and there's nothing wrong with that. Relying on little more than minor-key piano, strings, and a wonderfully pent-up female vocal, this is a hell of a torch song, full of a level of vulnerability, tunefulness, and lyrical detail that's a lot less common, and a lot more controversial, in underground circles than supposedly more avant-garde approaches. Multiple listens reveal subtle shades of humor: ""I'm getting a lot of work done/ I smoke two packs a day."" Nice work if you can get it.</p>
<p>The four other songs may manage to captivate on film, but here they can come off sounding like relatively slight genre exercises-- well-constructed and well-sung, yes, but inessential. ""I'm in Love With the City"" has a swinging, jazz-standard feel as Ireton worries about her ""cat's chance in hell"" in a love triangle. Better than an ice cube's chance, anyway. Murdoch takes the lead on ""He's a Loving Kind of Boy"", which plays nicely with the old ""chip on his shoulder"" cliché, though mariachi-tinged horns add a distracting, novelty element. On the smoldering, bluesy ""Baby's Just Waiting"", multiple female vocalists wait on their boy to come of age, get it, then complain about losing ""the kid who was eager to please."" Finale ""The Psychiatrist Is In"", with clattering hand percussion and a whiff of Roy Orbison-style rock'n'roll balladry, builds on this theme of maturation, but Green Day did the whole shrink/whore thing more succinctly 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Murdoch recently scheduled a few God Help the Girl live shows. Available video evidence suggests the songs from the album come across even better in concert than they do as 1s and 0s, and that will no doubt be the case with the <i>Stills</i> EP material, as well. Still-- ""Stills"" aside-- though this release is now available on iTunes, it often feels like what it originally was: a 10"" vinyl issue for the diehards who signed up to receive Murdoch's God Help the Girl subscription series. Then again, if subscribers get to find out more about the story behind all this music before the rest of us, membership may indeed have its privileges.</p></div>"|13640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13640-stills/|6.3|Marc Hogan

In the span of five years,  the British five-piece have grown in interesting ways, becoming arguably  the premier electronic pop act of the decade. In that time, Alexis Taylor  emerged as the wounded soul of the group, and was subsequently at the  center of their best moments-- the gentle cooing of ""And I Was a Boy  From School"", the narcoleptic drone of ""Over and Over"", and the  brave glee of ""Ready for the Floor"". But  returning to <i>Coming on Strong</i> reveals a surprisingly even divide  between the wispy de facto front man and Joe Goddard, Hot Chip's burly,  good-natured percussionist and synth player, with both men playing a  sort of down-tempo electro, rippling with tongue-in-cheek lyrics about  love and sex and their favorite songs. Goddard sang in his Burl Ives-on-Ambien  moan nearly as much as his counterpart, but Taylor's stripped down  aesthetic seemed to dominate. Over the years, as Hot Chip's songs  have become deeper and more complex and Taylor has stepped out as the  face of the group, Goddard's swooping production and fearless programming  appears to be winning out sonically. So it was little surprise that  Taylor's small-run solo debut last year, <i>Rubbed Out</i>, was a  quiet, almost painfully intimate affair. His ""Baby"" made Lou Barlow  sound like a tough guy.</p>
<p>With <i>Harvest Festival</i>,  Goddard completes the circle with a rippling set full of throbbing synthesizers  and thudding drum machines. He has assembled an accomplished but sterile  batch of tracks, some best heard mid-mix at the club rather than in  full. Each song title is a goofy play on natural culinary treats (from  the straightforward ""Strawberry Jam"" to the clever ""Half-Time  Oranges"", wisely placed as track number six of 12). Throughout there  are flashes of the drama Goddard crafted in Hot Chip's more skittish  songs-- the through line from <i>The Warning</i>'s ""Tchaparian""  to Goddard's twitchy, dissonant ""Pineapple Chunk"" is straight  and narrow. Loop is the operative word here. ""Pear-Shaped"" is dubstep-- good  dubstep, really-- through and through. It burrows deep into your body  and moves with a fluidity that sounds easy to construct but is deceptively  difficult to conjure. Rarely does Goddard flip the mic on and sing,  most explicitly on ""Lemon &amp; Lime (Home Time)"", a throwback  to <i>Coming on Strong</i>'s quieter moments of self-reflection. ""Take  me out, I want to see the morning,"" he burrs-- whether he's emerging  from an all-night rave, or an isolated cycle of despair is hard to tell-- Goddard's  voice is nothing if not mysteriously monotonous.</p>
<p>In many ways <i>Harvest Festival</i> just feels like a workout; a jaunt for Goddard's recently founded  label, Greco-Roman. It's a landing place for kinetic but somewhat  unformed songs-- like the pulsating, irresistible, and sort of silly  ""Go Bananas""-- sloppier, dance-driven ideas that cannot or will  not make it to Hot Chip's next album, which Goddard told the <i>NME</i> will  be ""club tunes but not the really banging ones. We just felt like  we wanted to focus on trying to write some really strong pop songs,  rather than making hard, aggressive dance floor tracks that have bits  of songs bolted onto them."" A synthesis of the old Hot Chip and the  new seems wise. But it makes <i>Harvest Festival</i> feel like nothing  more than a buffer; an appetizer. Ultimately this is smart but unfinished  work. Goddard has found a rare thing in Taylor: a match; they make an  implacable team. And they needn't stray to be great.</p></div>"|13676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13676-harvest-festival/|6.9|Sean Fennessey

In some ways, the two albums were opposites. <i>Uproot </i>flowed like water, while <i>Patches</i>, with its live guitars and abrasive textures, scorched like fire. On <i>Solar Life Raft</i>, Rupture works with Matt Shadetek, with whom he runs the fledgling Dutty Artz imprint, and who contributed his breathtaking dub remix of Iron Shirt's ""I Gave You All My Love"" to <i>Uproot</i>. You might expect another new collaborator to give rise to another new style, but the album backtracks over <i>Uproot</i>'s well-excavated terrain instead.</p>
<p><i>Solar Life Raft</i> is heavy on deformed, quaking bass, with a variety of remixes, original content, and tweaked lifts, built in real time into a hulking apparatus. It also uses brief left-field surprises as ligaments, oases, and head-crackers: An excerpt from Nico Muhly's <i>Mothertongue </i>stands in for <i>Uproot</i>'s Ekkehard Ehlers drop, and 30 seconds of Luc Ferrari's strident computer noise bridges ""4th Story Waterline"", a sinuous original production, and an airy but tuff Shadetek remix of Jahdan Blakkamoore's ""Long Road"". If <i>Uproot </i>felt like it was establishing a new template, <i>Solar Life Raft</i> follows one-- one of its creator's own devising, but a template nevertheless.</p>
<p>The selections are mostly excellent, although once in awhile, concept trumps efficacy-- it's really neat that the poet Elizabeth Alexander, who read at Obama's inauguration, appears on the record, but her flat delivery is only tangentially musical. The use of poetry is much more effective on ""More Pets"", where Caroline Bergvall recites cheery nonsense about animals in a voice as fluent and mellifluous as the music. And the mixing is, of course, excellent. With two turntables, our sense of space remains somewhat flat-- this happens over here and that happens over there, with only a lateral distance implied. Rupture's three-turntable approach adds another plane, breaking that narrow tunnel wide open.</p>
<p>The album embodies the maxim ""live locally, think globally."" Geographically diverse selections from Paavoharju, Mizz Beats (""Blue Night"", an album standout), and Timeblind rub shoulders with Brooklyn natives like Telepathe, Blakkamoore, and Gang Gang Dance, who get a fleet remix of ""Bebey"". Even globe-trotting DJs have to tighten their belts in this economy. The whole thing was recorded in Brooklyn, where Shadetek also lives. He's been touted as the gritty pugilist to Rupture's tweedy chin-stroker, but that's probably an overstatement for convenience: This is a guy who named one of his albums, <i>Pale Fire</i>, after a Nabokov novel.</p>
<p>The record opens with a splicing-- ""mash-up"" does not do the transaction justice-- of Timeblind's ""Space Cadet"" and Shadetek's ""Strength in Numbers"". If you're unfamiliar with the original tracks, good luck figuring out where one ends and the other begins. You'll be surprised when you look them up. (Spoiler: the ruffling ambiance belongs to Timeblind, while the confetti-throwing reggae horns are Shadetek's.) The same goes for Stagga's ""The Bad Dance"" and Babylon System's ""Get on Up""-- it's not about just matching up bpms; the tracks get fully field-stripped and then recoupled with new functionality. The original productions rough out the poles the album navigates, from the bendy bass of collaboration ""Underwater High Rise"" to the haunting ambiance of Rupture original ""El Verdugo"". It's a thoroughly enjoyable album that rewards many listens, even if it does feel a bit, to borrow from Ghostface, like it could've been called <i>More Uproot</i>. But as someone who still spins last year's Rupture regularly, I can certainly live with that.</p></div>"|13680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13680-solar-life-raft/|7.7|Brian Howe

Yet, as Ola Podrida, he emphasizes lyrics and music equally, using each to evoke what the other cannot express. Ola Podrida may bear some similarities to groups like Band of Horses and My Morning Jacket-- in the expansiveness and Americana textures of his songs-- but his second album, <i>Belly of the Lion</i>, is unlikely to get fists pumping or crowds surging: Wingo is a strong live performer, but his music remains private rather than public, introverted rather than outgoing. He projects these songs inward, creating a record that is quietly cinematic.</p>
<p><i>Belly of the Lion</i> is more compact than Ola Podrida's 2007 self-titled debut, which means it is sharper, shapelier, and only slightly less substantial. Lyrically, the themes are identical: Every silver lining has a dark cloud, and relationships of any kind-- whether romantic, familial, or social-- are fraught with the potential for loss. What makes them especially affecting is their specificity: Wingo fills these songs with concrete nouns, proper names, and crystalline details, effectively rooting them in a real and recognizable world. ""Your Father's Basement"" imbues its coming-of-age story with a certain <i>vérité</i>, as two teenage boys blast Eric B. &amp; Rakim and look for dirty mags behind the water heater, while the music crests into an uncertain conclusion that lends magnitude to their adolescent conspiracy. Elsewhere, Wingo's guitar shimmers as ""Lakes of Wine"" pans across a tableau of mysteriously related images: a notebook found on the side of the road, a phone number scrawled on a bathroom stall. There's nothing out of the ordinary here, yet Wingo invests each carefully selected object with symbolic weight.</p>
<p>And yet, these lyrics would have much less power without the music. Wingo recorded <i>Belly of the Lion</i> in his apartment, playing all the instruments himself (although he did hire a drummer for four songs), so the range of sounds is limited. Their range of use, however, is not. He knows just how to score these miniature movies to enhance their drama-- when to bring in the droning guitars to bolster the tension of ""Donkey"", how to overlay the delicate melody of ""Monday Morning"" against a backdrop of guitar distortion, how to wring maximum effect out of an incremental tempo change on ""Roomful of Sparrows"", and when to counter a stormy crescendo with a stark acoustic guitar on closer ""This Old World"". Such techniques, no doubt picked up during his soundtrack work, draw out deeper shades of meaning in his songs, balancing optimism with despair. Or, as he sings on the countrified opener ""The Closest We Will Ever Be"": ""There's always some shadows within the prettiest of scenes/ I'll cast one on you, and you'll cast one on me."" That realization gives this short, modest album an inordinate emotional heft and makes it linger long after those last notes have stopped reverberating.</p></div>"|13682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13682-belly-of-the-lion/|7.8|Stephen M.

(There are six weeks left on the calendar, which might give them time to cut a few more tracks and maybe record and release a couple dozen live sets.) This flurry of activity comes on the heels of a comparatively sedate 2008, which saw the group push out one measly studio full-length, one LP of the live persuasion, one and a half EPs, and just the one single.  Suffice it to say that whatever caffeine-laced tall boys and/or illicit recreational substances John Dwyer has been (ab)using since adding an extra E to his band's name, they are most definitely working.  Thee Oh Sees' <i>Nuggets</i>-friendly aesthetic could very easily wear itself thin, but Dwyer and friends have found plenty of ways to keep that formula from falling flat.</p>
<p>The group's first full-length offering this year, <i>Help</i>, is the apotheosis of what Thee Oh Sees can do as a rock group-- namely, kick out jams that pack a thick and brutal punch while offering a softer, poppier, and not-so-mildly psychedelic side at the same time.  If the group rolled their joints on the sleeve of a first-edition copy of <i>Black Monk Time</i>, and took slugs of moonshine from the 13th Floor Elevators' electric jug (unplugged, of course), it wouldn't come as a surprise.  And while they couldn't be blamed if they simply opted to offer more <i>Help</i> on their second 2009 LP, it's to their credit that they upset that particular apple cart, among many others, on <i>Dog Poison</i>.</p>
<p>If it were approached from a different angle, a song like album opener ""The River Rushes (To Screw MD Over)"" might not have sounded out of place on <i>Dog Poison</i>'s predecessor.  But by switching to an acoustic guitar and letting the flute player channel Ian Anderson, Thee Oh Sees give their sound a new wrinkle.  Indeed, with Dwyer copping a few vocal moves from Mark E. Smith, ""River"" ends up sounding a little like the Fall covering the Kinks.  There's another, purer, Kinks-like turn on <i>Dog Poison</i>, with the loping high-pitched tra-la-las of ""The Sun Goes All Around"" sounding like something left on the cutting room floor from <i>Village Green Preservation Society</i>.  Elsewhere on the album, the group emulates the cavernous, smoky gait of Deerhunter (""Head of State""), shambles in a folkier fashion (""Fake Song""), spaces out a bit (""Dead Energy""), and mostly just lets it all hang out over the course of this LP's 24 minutes.</p>
<p>Even when they decide to rock out, like on the appropriately titled ""The Fizz"", Thee Oh Sees sound footloose and fancy-free. Or ""sloppy,"" if you prefer-- in terms of sound and vibe, this record has more in common with <i>Zork's Tape Bruise</i> (the aforementioned demo collection) than either of the last two ""real"" Thee Oh Sees LPs, with a not-unwelcome what-the-fuck yeah-more-flute attitude taken to how the songs get put together.  But instead of damning this as an uninspired odds-and-sods mishmash, I'd rather think of <i>Dog Poison</i> as the band officially unwinding from the (relatively) exacting precision of <i>Help</i>, and cleansing their own palette in preparation for what's next.  After all, given how John Dwyer seems to operate, it wouldn't surprise me if he'd take a relaxing break from making music by simply making more music.</p></div>"|13691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13691-dog-poison/|6.8|David Raposa

And yet, even in an era of omnivorous musical consumption and boundless genre tourism, the sight of a computerized Kurt Cobain belting out Bon Jovi's ""You Give Love a Bad Name"" in a recent <i>Guitar Hero 5</i> demo reel was enough to revert the good/bad taste divide back to 1988 borders. For Nirvana fans, the <i>Guitar Hero </i>scandal was more than just a case of a dead rock-star's visage being exploited for the sake of peddling product. Few artists treated record collections as an extension of personal politics quite like Cobain; having him sing a hair-metal hit is not just contrary to his musical taste, but his entire value system. (Though one can't help but wonder what a guy who once skewered alpha-male behavior in a song called ""Mr. Moustache"" would make of indie's current facial-hair fetish.)</p>
<div>
<p>And yet, Cobain was no stranger himself to challenging accepted notions of cool. When it first emerged 20 years ago, Nirvana's debut album, <i>Bleach</i>, represented an equally heretical notion to some indie aesthetes: Flipper-grade sludge-punk molded into Beatles-schooled pop schematics. By 1989, indie rock was already making a rightward shift across the radio dial-- Dinosaur Jr. had covered Peter Frampton, the Butthole Surfers were dropping in not-too-subtle Black Sabbath and Zeppelin references-- but rather than using post-hardcore noise to desecrate their traditional FM-radio influences, Nirvana used it to give their dinosaur rock more teeth. In Cobain, they had a frontman with uncommonly melodic instincts, but shot through a voice that sounded like it was coughing up blood; in Krist Novoselic, a bassist who could hit the heretofore untapped sweet spot between Paul McCartney and the Melvins.</p>
<p>But unlike most rock bands who divided pop history between before and after, Nirvana's impact was not immediate. Upon its release, <i>Bleach</i> was a modest indie rock success at 40,000 copies sold, and the album's low-budget legend-- it was recorded for a scant $600, footed by the band's temporary second guitarist, Jason Everman-- often overshadows the music within. At that point, Nirvana had yet to divest itself of its Pete Best: drummer Chad Channing, whose scrappy style wasn't fully suited to the band's growing propensity for crater-inducing stompers. (Three <i>Bleach</i> tracks-- ""Floyd the Barber"", ""Paper Cuts"", and ""Downer""-- were actually helmed by Melvins thud-master Dale Crover, and you can really tell.) And the album's first single-- a cover of 1960s Dutch-popsters Shocking Blue's ""Love Buzz""-- is more emblematic of the dementoid new wave that Nirvana would indulge in on their future B-sides than the metallic Pixies-punk that would turn them into stars.</p>
<p>But rather than unfairly compare it to the platinum sheen of sophomore release <i>Nevermind</i>, <i>Bleach</i> is best appreciated today as a snapshot of a specific time and place, of a Seattle scene bubbling up before it turned into a media adjective: In the Aero Zeppelin grind of ""School"" and the Mudhoney-quoting scum-bucket thrash of ""Negative Creep"", you have the perfect audio manifestation of the stark, exhilarating black-and-white Charles Peterson photos that captured late-80s Seattle like a series of strobe-light flickers (and which populate much of this reissue's 52-page photo booklet). Original producer Jack Endino's new remastering job gives <i>Bleach</i> a much-needed boost in fidelity, but there's an intrinsic, primordial murkiness to this album that can't be polished-- while Axl was welcoming the masses into the Sunset Strip jungle, Nirvana dragged the Sub Pop set into the bleak, chilly backwoods from which they came.</p>
<p>Though briskly paced, <i>Bleach</i> is a front-loaded record, the maniacal/melodic contrasts of its stellar first half-- anchored by the epochal anti-love song ""About a Girl""-- ceding to the more period-typical grunge of its second. The bonus live performance included here (recorded in 1990 at Portland's Pine Street Theater) suggests as much, mostly ignoring <i>Bleach</i>'s side B to showcase important transitional tracks: the scabrous pop of ""Sappy"" (later to emerge as ""Verse Chorus Verse"" on the 1993 <i>No Alternative</i>compilation); ""Dive"", a blueprint for <i>Nevermind</i>'s plutonium-grade rockers; and ""Been a Son"", which bears the influence of Cobain's beloved Vaselines (whose ""Molly's Lips"" is covered here). It's a testament to both Endino's live-in-the-room production style and Nirvana's raucous onstage energy that <i>Bleach</i> and the bonus concert set sound like they were cut in the same session. But the concert also presents Nirvana in a light that the band's subsequently troubled and tragic story so rarely affords them: a simple, playful power trio who could lay waste to a drunk club crowd on a Saturday night.</p>
<p>Two years and one Dave Grohl later, the circumstances couldn't have been more different for Nirvana. Amid rumors of Kurt'n'Courtney drug problems and inter-band acrimony, the trio took to the stage for their headlining Sunday-night appearance at the Reading Festival, effectively cementing their status as the biggest-- and most gossiped about-- rock band in the world. If <i>Bleach</i> contains just trace evidence of the band that would, almost overnight, force radio stations to flip formats and record stores to open up ""alternative"" sections, the <i>Live at Reading</i> CD/DVD provides formidable evidence of perhaps the last rock'n'roll band to transform the monoculture in its own image. And yet, despite Cobain's cheeky show-biz entrance-- rolled onto stage in a wheelchair by music journalist Everett True, singing a line from Bette Midler's ""The Rose"", and then mock-collapsing-- the Reading set shows a band that hadn't changed all that much fundamentally from that Pine Street Theater gig two years previous.</p>
<p>Cobain's newly acquired, generational spokesmen duties didn't make him any more fond of engaging the audience with stage banter, ceding emcee duties to the jovial Novoselic during guitar changes. And even when playing to the biggest audience of their career, Nirvana blast through the 25-song setlist with a barrel-down, no-bullshit intensity that suggests it didn't matter if they were playing to 100 people or 100,000. And most pertinently, both concerts capture the band at crucial, between-album turning points: where the Pine Street Theater set shows a band burnishing its pop appeal, <i>Live at Reading</i> betrays Cobain's eagerness to tear it down, dispensing with the obvious <i>Nevermind</i> hits by the mid-set point, while reserving the encores for seething covers of 80s California punks Fang's suitably sardonic ""The Money Will Roll Right In"" and the Wipers' ""D-7"". In retrospect, the concert crystallizes the moment when Cobain stopped serving his servants and started serving himself, pointing the way to 1993's notoriously caustic <i>In Utero</i>.</p>
<p>Given its long-standing popularity as a bootleg, you can't help but wonder why <i>Live at Reading</i> wasn't officially released back in the mid-90s instead of the live compilation <i>From the Muddy Banks of Wishkah</i>; certainly, <i>Reading </i>makes for a more appropriate, electrified complement to the band's other career-defining performance, 1994's <i>Unplugged in New York</i> release. And for the sake of squeezing the entire set (save for ""Love Buzz"") on a single disc, the <i>Reading</i> CD excises pretty much all of the DVD's between-song interactions (most notably, the goof on Boston's ""More Than a Feeling"" that precedes the similarly riffed ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"") and key contextual interludes that reveal the tumult leading up to this triumphant performance (e.g., a heartfelt plea from Cobain to have the crowd shout a conciliatory ""We love you Courtney"" in the wake of her receiving the Yoko treatment from the British tabloids). But the CD's career-spanning tracklist-- touching on the best of <i>Bleach</i>, most of <i>Nevermind</i>, choice singles and B-sides (""Sliver"", ""Aneurysm""), three <i>In Utero </i>previews (""Tourette's"", ""Dumb"", ""All Apologies""), and the aforementioned covers-- actually makes it a far superior, more comprehensive introduction for Nirvana newbies than the band's 2002 greatest-hits compilation. Like the Who's <i>Live at Leeds</i> or Cheap Trick's <i>At Budokan</i>, it's an indispensible document of a legendary band at their most invincible.</p>
<p>And even if you're the sort of Nirvana die-hard who's been sitting on an audio bootleg of this gig for the past 17 years,you really need the DVD-- for a band whose visual legacy mostly amounts to a handful of stylized videos and the lowkey <i>Unplugged</i> special, <i>Live at Reading</i> effectively grants you side-stage access to the band in their mosh-pit-stoking, drum-set-toppling prime, putting you as close to the action as the band's mysterious friend Tony, who's seen flailing onstage throughout the show like an epilpetic Bez. Like the <i>Bleach</i> reissue, the <i>Live at Reading</i> packaging is heavy on photos and other scrapbook visuals, but entirely bereft of liner-note reminiscences and analysis-- because lord knows we don't need another essay-length rumination about Nirvana's cultural import and Cobain's conflicted relationship with stardom. The most lasting images on the <i>Live at Reading</i> DVD-- from the 60,000-strong pogo pit, to the blood sprayed on Cobain's pick guard at set's end, to the awkward but poignant post-show meeting with a young, leukemia-stricken fan-- tell you everything you need to know.</p>

Things like Daytrotter, La Blogotheque, Black Cab Sessions, ""Don't Look Down"" and other Pitchfork.tv shows, and AOL Sessions, have become the ""MTV Unplugged"" for the era of inexpensive digital technology, constantly shifting economic imperatives, and small-but-fervent online publics. Though not sponsored by an outside entity, Asobi Seksu's <i>Rewolf</i>, sold at merch tables earlier this year as <i>Acoustic at Olympic Studios</i>, fits perfectly in this niche, offering nine stripped-down reimaginings of the duo's music-- most from 2009's <i>Hush</i>-- with a cover of Hope Sandoval's smoky 2002 single ""Suzanne"".</p>
<p>One of the last works recorded at the London studio most known for legendary sessions with the Beatles and Stones, <i>Rewolf</i>-- cut on an off-day during a tour-- contains a few nice surprises. Where<i> Hush</i> felt too safe and familiar, walking carefully in the footprints of the still very good <i>Citrus</i>,<i> </i>a few recut tracks here emphasize some of the group's best qualities.  ""Blind Little Rain"", for instance, was too delicate to be as pumped up with echo as it was, but the <i>Rewolf</i> version-- for just piano and voice-- sounds lovely and pristine in comparison, placing all due emphasis on the fragile melody. Though I liked the wobbly sci-fi undertones of the <i>Hush</i> version of ""Gliss"", and the brawny guitars of <i>Citrus </i>highlight ""New Years"", the stripped-down models of each-- reduced to xylophone and acoustic guitar, prove that strong compositions can withstand a bit of transformation. On the other hand, ""Urusai Tori"", from this year's <i>Transparence</i> EP (now called ""Bossa""), shifts the focus fully to the duo's aptitude at interpretation. What started as a punchy number with well-placed glitchy electronic undertones gets thoroughly, and imaginatively, remodeled as something of a Stan Getz pastiche.</p>
<p>Not everything works so well, though. ""Thursday"" is more or less the duo's signature-- and best-- song, in large part because it's the group's best use of the studio-as-instrument. Blowing away the overdubbed fog and leaving nothing but a skeletal piano/acoustic guitar/voice structure is an act of bravery, but my over-familiarity with the original is the only thing holding my attention. It's certainly not the breathily spoken French overlaying the song's second refrain. Along the same line, the inclusion of 2004's ""Walk on the Moon"" does little here save remind us that it's more or less ""Thursday""'s first draft  (<i>Hush</i>'s ""In the Sky"" was version 3.0). And though there are atmospheric similarities between Chikudate's and Hope Sandoval's approaches to singing, the ""Suzanne"" cover doesn't do much other than reaffirm the fact that the former Mazzy Star frontwoman has a lock on hazy, smoky ambience. Chikudate's porcelain-doll approach works for a lot of things, but does nothing to improve the original.</p>
<p><i>Rewolf</i> is, of course, a quickie one-off interstitial between new material, meant more as an accompaniment to previous releases than a standalone work. At the same time though, it still manages to highlight that, when they want to, these two can stretch into a starker (yet still pretty) realm that would frighten off less-talented groups with equal predilections for studio wizardry. <i>Hush </i>left me confused, and a bit concerned, as to what Asobi Seksu's next move will be. Though it's lightweight, <i>Rewolf</i> gives me a bit of hope that they'll push themselves outward a bit more next time.</p></div>"|13685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13685-rewolf/|6.4|Eric Harvey

Humorless, esoteric, unaccomplished, dilettantish-- you know, those kinds of ideas. From a consumer standpoint, such music is generally the domain of completists, fans so devoted to the flagship that they must own every record any member has ever touched.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Wilco fans need not fear <i>Extended Vacation</i>, the fourth LP by On Fillmore, the long-running if infrequent instrumental side project of Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche and upright bassist Darin Gray, formerly of Chicago standouts Brise-Glace. These seven interwoven pieces delight: Accessible but not pedestrian, complex but not esoteric, <i>Extended Vacation</i> feels improvised in spirit, but, in both structure and sound, it reveals two focused, imaginative composers and performers. The melodies and the warped sounds-- a vibraphone blurred into an organ, animal samples sculpted into a symphony, xylophone lines fashioned into music box tunes-- make <i>Extended Vacation</i> the most instantly likable On Fillmore album yet. But the latticework way in which it all comes together-- in pieces that flirt with Tropicália, drone, and Sunday morning jazz on an album that treats the unexpected like its favorite conquest-- likely makes it On Fillmore's most enduring album, too. <i>(The Album)</i> included, it's the only essential Wilco-related release of 2009.</p>
<p>The first On Fillmore LP since 2004's <i>Sleeps with Fishes</i>, <i>Extended Vacation</i> starts with a pun-- the album title. Get it: They're back? Its opening and closing tracks-- ""Checking In"" and ""Clearing Out""-- joke on function, too. Sure, On Fillmore might be instrumental, but they're also a playful band, evidenced by the fun they seem to be having with sound here. While ""Master Moon"" is guided by Gray's upright bass saunter, it's the circus of music surrounding it-- junk percussion like rattles and shakers, or a wah-wah effect applied generously to a thumb piano-- that supplies the spirit. Or when the bass and drum enter together a minute into ""Checking In"", Gray and Kotche sound ecstatic, as if they've been waiting five years for this moment.</p>
<p>Though Kotche is only an equal star here, no mention of <i>Extended Vacation </i>would be complete without acknowledging his special place in modern music. Who else in rock bands as popular as Wilco-- these days, smiling on the covers of the biggest music magazines and selling out amphitheaters and arenas on multiple continents-- consistently works with so many boundary-bending projects? Kotche has composed for Kronos Quartet and, last year, wrote new works for the Bang on a Can All-Stars that tapped the folk traditions of the American South. His most recent solo album, 2006's <i>Mobile</i>, mixed the legacies of modern composers with huge chunks of world music. Even on his flagship act's records, Kotche's never been just a drummer. He's been an explorer who refused to be circumscribed by his band's public ascendance. As appealing as it is challenging, <i>Extended Vacation </i>is the sort of album that might even make those Wilco fans who can sing only ""Kingpin"" believe it.</p></div>"|13694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13694-extended-vacation/|8.0|Grayson Currin

From gnashing noise-rock to synth-heavy freakouts to Krautrock rhythms and electronic textures, the band never lingered on any particular style or sound for very long. Listeners and critics alike have compared them to Shellac, Devo, Braniac, even Kraftwerk-- a pretty disparate group of pretty innovative bands. Even the album they recorded before breaking up, the traightforward hardcore <i>Half Control</i> (which only saw release last year), was another relative left turn. But throughout all the personnel changes and stylistic shifts, the band was never dull. Until now.</p>
<p>Singer J. Ryan and drummer-turned-guitarist Rick Pelletier are the only founding members left, joined here by Dan St. Jaques and Brian Dufresne on bass and drums. ""Hot Food"" starts the record on a reassuring note, with biting and saturated guitars, backup vocals rearranged until they sound like gargling robots, and a short, spooky Moog. The repetitive riff and call-and-response of following track ""Roam From Home"", however, are more indicative of the rest of the record. <span> </span>Almost all the songs are recorded with monotonous bottom-string guitar riffs and lurching, staccato rhythms. In their swagger and bluster, most of these songs have a surprisingly classic rock feel. (Ryan goes so far as to quote ""Come Together"" on ""Half Life"" and ""Macarthur Park"" on ""Midnight Rails"".) As for any electronic textures, there are few synthesizers in earshot, save for the aforementioned ""Hot Food"" and the occasional low-in-the-mix accoutrement on ""Half Life"" or ""Hearts and Rocks"". ""Wilson P."" adds a glassier, more distinctive guitar riff along with some organ for some needed variety, and the hushed patter of ""Rise"", the closing track, is the record's most intense moment. However, the songs fail to distinguish themselves from one another and bleed into one lumbering, forgettable whole.</p>
<p>That said, the band sounds excited to be back together. The austere production catches an undeniable energy, and although their lyrics are a little less manic in their delivery, they're still sung with convincing menace. Holding them to their past glory may not be fair, but before their hiatus, they were a forward-thinking and creatively restless band. If there's any standard they should be held to, it's that. Given that the band has been touring, there still may be bolder efforts ahead.</p></div>"|13679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13679-a-good-year-for-hardness/|4.5|Jason Crock

Their retro moves seemed less about building upon the decade's musical legacy as encapsulating its finer points for consumption by a new generation. Which, hey, was a perfectly cool way to go about things. At their best, the band positively nailed the bruised romanticism and exquisite melancholy that marked a certain strain of that decade's best pop, and besides, most of the signature propagators of said pop were by then long gone or, worse yet, distant shadows of their former selves. Plus it's not like you'll catch any of the old guard in the tiny-ish clubs and early-afternoon festival slots the Mary Onettes are used to playing, so for those seeking stadium-sized grandeur in parlor-intimate spaces, the band has something relatively unique to offer. The self-titled <i>The Mary Onettes</i> from 2007, in fact, turned out not unlike many records from the era it emulated: several excellent singles or would-be singles (""Lost"", ""Slow"", ""Void"", ""Under the Guillotine""), the token slow jam (""The Laughter""), an effective opener and closer (""Pleasure Songs"" and ""Still"", respectively), and, well, some not terribly memorable stuff in between. All of which makes <i>Islands</i>, the Mary Onettes' follow-up, an at once enchanting and frustrating listen. Yes, the high points of the previous record are duplicated here-- but so too are the same problems that occasionally bogged down that record.</p>
<p>Opener ""Puzzles"" actually betters <i>The Mary Onettes</i>' lead track, the great-tune-with-questionable-lyrics ""Pleasure Songs"", galloping along on a spritely keyboard riff and setting an appropriate tone for the nine tracks to follow. ""Let's talk about what feels strange on the inside,"" vocalist Philip Ekström offers, an apt enough invitation to the scores of disaffected youngsters with which this sort of music has always resonated best. ""Dare"", ""Symmetry"", and ""The Disappearance of My Youth"", then, are the hot singlez here, and each has the band showing off a few new tricks. ""Symmetry"" gets extra sentimental with the strings, ""Dare"" soars near the heights of ""Lost"" on the strength of plenty of ""ooohs"" and ""ahhhs"", and ""Disappearance"" features-- what else?-- a children's choir joining in to sing the title line. Their brief major label dalliance a half decade behind them, it's clear the Mary Onettes' ambitions haven't wavered in the least. Elsewhere, a few numbers-- notably the slow jam (""Cry for Love"") and the closer (""Bricks"")-- fall short of their counterparts on LP1. The former lacks the poise and grace of ""The Laughter"", while the latter generally sounds like a limp rehash of several earlier tracks on <i>Islands</i>, very much in want of a distinguishing feature. At least ""Still"" settled on a strident march beat that evoked a spirited departure off into the sunset (or, better yet, the rain); ""Bricks"" just kind of meanders off in a mid-tempo haze.</p>
<p>Indeed, distinction would serve the rest of the tracks on <i>Islands</i> well; as on <i>The Mary Onettes</i>, the stuff in between here tends to drift by largely unnoticed. Ekström has stated that the title <i>Islands</i> refers to how ""every song is like a record of its very own,"" and ironically this is perhaps the biggest snare this time around: without a sonic story arc of sorts to create continuity across <i>Islands</i>, we're encouraged to hold the tracks against one another (hence the partitioning above into ""great"" and ""just okay"" camps) rather than consider them in relation to the whole of the album. In short, somebody needs to introduce these guys to transitions, interludes, intros, outros, deliberate sketches, ambience, that sort of thing (although, in fairness, <i>Islands</i> does open with a nice bit of panoramic, cloud-parting feedbackery)-- a means to more effectively tie all these so-called ""islands"" together. The otherwise unremarkable ""Century"" includes a telling line: ""I've never been good at holding back,"" Ekström declares there. Until he is, the Mary Onettes will likely remain a killer singles band that makes just pretty good albums.</p></div>"|13657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13657-islands/|6.7|Matthew Solarski

Hurting their record sales. Hurting their ability  to control narrative. And, perhaps most crucially, hurting their ability  to self-edit. Flip cam freestyles, track-a-day mixtapes, local radio  interviews delivered worldwide. Reining it in has never been more difficult.  To his credit, Wale has appeared to be in clear control of his output.  In the space of three years he's released three proper mixtapes: 2007's  giddy grab bag <i>100 Miles &amp; Running</i>, 2008's triumphant and  savvy <i>The Mixtape About Nothing</i>, and this year's modest <i> Back to the Feature</i>. But even that tempered rollout may have been  too much. Wale's proper solo debut, <i>Attention Deficit</i>, feels  like a mishmash of those three tapes, flashing greatness but almost  never transcending, and always sounding effortful. Has he said too much  already?</p>
<p>Initially positioned as a refreshing  rejoinder in a new generation of rappers, Wale was never fit for savior-dom.  He's said the Roots' Black Thought is his favorite MC. That's  about right: technically gifted, occasionally thrilling, mostly destined  to be a cog in a machine. <i>Attention Deficit</i> seems to ignore that,  especially on the front end. What's made so many rap debuts successful  is a fluidity, a connectivity from moment to moment. Wale's been slapped  with the dreaded ""no personality"" tag in recent months. The opposite  is true: Wale seems to jump constantly from persona to persona.</p>
<p>Opener ""Triumph"", a terrific, Afro-beat-inspired production by TV on the  Radio's Dave Sitek, indicates this will be a sonic adventure. It's  not particularly. ""Mama Told Me"" is a sort of post-Kanye reflection  on how difficult it is coming up in the game, namedropping people in  his life whose names you will not recognize. It's been done before  and better. ""Mirrors"" is sonically consistent-- squealing horns  and down-low bass-- but also features that tried-and-true rap trope:  the Bun B feature. It's negligible. ""Pretty Girls"" is an ode to  women via his native Washington D.C. sound, produced by longtime partner  Best Kept Secret, sampling legendary Go-Go crew the Backyard Band, and  featuring that group's Weensey. It's a classic hip-hop raveup, loose  and fun. And then Atlanta's Gucci Mane shows up. Wasn't this supposed  to be a D.C. anthem? ""World Tour"" is typically bland, R&amp;B diva-led  (in this case Jazmine Sullivan) nostalgia-stroking patter. ""Let It  Loose"" is the Pharrell record. Six songs in and we're hitting all  the bases, without any sense of what it means to be Wale.</p>
<p>The second half reveals a bit  more: Wale is obsessed with women, whether recounting the story of a  coke-addicted fameball on Mark Ronson's delicate ""90210"", or emotionally  thrashing over an ex on the loping, gorgeous ""Diary"". He is distinctly  interested in the female experience, even if the subject is launching  him into paranoia by refusing to pick up the phone at 4 a.m. on a Saturday  night. This is a unique gift-- I can't recall the last time an MC  seemed so tapped into a woman's perspective while still feeling the  chill of romantic strain. Sitek returns with the astounding ""TV in  the Radio"", a song that both convinced me of K'Naan as a serious  rapper (debatable until now) and positioned Wale properly in the mix,  rapidly firing syllables like a semi-automatic. It's a bravura performance.</p>
<p>""Contemplate"", produced by Syience, samples Rihanna's ""Question  Existing"" and transforms it into a dark, brooding piece about the  difficulties of love. That it arrives amidst Rihanna's troubling trauma-as-promotional  run is sad and fitting. Alas, there won't be  much to gain from ""Chillin'"", the much-maligned Lady Gaga collaboration  and botched first single. This was the first step in Wale's multiple  personality debacle and he seems to know as much-- nothing else on <i> Attention Deficit</i> resembles the goofy sneakers-shouting writing  here. Ironically, it's the song that directly precedes ""Chillin'""  that feels most truthful. ""Shades"", featuring Chrisette Michele,  is a resilient look at being a dark-skinned African-American (Wale is  first generation Nigerian-American). On the song he raps, ""They napped  and slept on me/ Man, I hate black/ Skin tone, I wish I could take  it back/ But rearrange my status, maybe if I was khaki/ Associating  light-skinned with classy/ The minstrel show showed a me that was not  me."" Internal rhyme schemes, halting phrasing, thoughtful self-exploration;  this is Wale at his best. Not as a preening star filling in the gaps  for a king-making debut. A regular person, with doubts and sadness,  joy and confidence. There's just not enough of it on <i>Attention  Deficit</i>.</p></div>"|13695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13695-attention-deficit/|6.6|Sean Fennessey

""I'm tired of moving my jaw,"" she also sneers, in case you didn't pick up on her disinterest. The morose opening track on <i>Chomp More</i> reinforces the standard notion that the R.E.M. contemporaries were Athens, Georgia's version of Gang of Four. But this reissue, another DFA-sanctioned dip into the band's brief back catalog, highlights the unhinged spin the band put on post-punk, a joyous take on mechanized funk.</p>
<p>Recorded in 1982 after Pylon had already taken a U.S. road trip with Leeds' most famous Marxist rock collective, <i>Chomp</i> sounds more assured and more open. Packaged in a record sleeve with a die-cut ""bite"" on the edge and filled with stripped-down dance rhythms and proto-indie guitar riffs, it telegraphs bigger ambitions than 1980's <i>Gyrate</i>. Hay's attitude and vocals, the flipside of the bright camp coming from her contemporaries in the B-52's, swings from dry observations to passionate fury, further broadcasting the group's desire to evolve. She's slick yet airy on ""Yo-Yo"", a taut take on a relationship's heavy emotional swings, while she growls on the bright New Wave of ""No Clocks"", a passionate song about the honeymoon period. ""Crazy"" finds her slowly becoming unhinged, escalating into possessed, shriek-laden crescendo. R.E.M.'s jangly cover, which appeared on <i>Dead Letter Office</i>, wisely dials back, since Stipe's vocals lack Hay's fury and sharp edge.</p>
<p>The creative guitar playing of the late Randy Bewley, who passed away earlier this year, highlights the stylistic crossroads the group never steered away from. Bewley pivoted a bit towards college rock riffs on <i>Chomp</i>, with the wry, surf-like playing on instrumental ""Italian Movie Theme"" and the crisp, cold runs on ""Crazy"" and ""Gyrate"". But his wiry, pointillistic style, like the flinty tones that open ""Beep"", dominate and helped drive Pylon's dance floor rhythms. His scratched, staccato notes on ""Yo-Yo"" were a perfect counterpoint to the oozing bass of Michael Lachowski.</p>
<p>The expanded section of <i>Chomp More</i>-- which includes three alternate mixes and ""Four Minutes"", an echo-laden, slow-motion collage of samples and sounds-- is mostly surplus reels of studio experimentation, intriguing considering the group disbanded shortly after album's release. The 7"" mix of ""Crazy"" is more breezy and less interesting than the album cut, but the pitch-shifted vocals and faint echoes found on ""Yo-Yo (Male Version)"" suggest a faint dub feel, and the reworked ""Gyrate"" churns together sound effects, a vortex of rhythms that collapses on itself. It's unlikely there will be additional Pylon releases in the future (the band had hinted at new recordings prior to Bewley's death). In addition to getting more work from this pioneering band into wider circulation, <i>Chomp More </i>points to the upward trajectory they achieved after only a few years. Coming years after the post-punk revival strip mined the genre's signifiers, this album still manages to sound unique.</p></div>"|13692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13692-chomp-more/|7.7|Patrick Sisson

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I saw Dark Meat play a small club in Washington D.C. shortly after the release of their debut album, <i>Universal Indians</i>. The Athens collective, whose members numbered well into double digits, couldn't all fit on the tiny corner stage, so a guitarist and a horn player had to play from the audience. Decked out in warpaint and throwing handfuls of confetti like grenades, they actually outnumbered the crowd, which seemed at the time both sad and somehow impressive. Bandleader Jim McHugh has a vision, and while it may not be logistically or financially feasible, he never leaves that fifth tambourine player at home.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For their second album, <i>Truce Opium</i>, Dark Meat have shed a few members-- they're back down into the single digits-- but they actually manage to expand their sound. Where once they mixed the most avant of jazz influences with the Stonesiest of classic rock, now the band blends in, well, pretty much everything imaginable: metal drone, prog effects, throat singing, Southern folk, even granola-crusted jamband. Predictably, <i>Truce Opium</i> bursts at the seams with ideas: A fife rises out of the din on opener ""The Faint Smell of Moss"" to give the percussive riffs more emphasis. On ""Future Galaxies"", the horns swell and subside hypnotically, recalling the Doppler Effect keyboards on Kraftwerk's ""Autobahn"", and closer ""Song of the New Year"" is a 12-minute sing-along dirge that slowly accrues instruments even as it threatens to fall apart.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That crammed conceptuality is an essential part of Dark Meat's appeal, but those densely packed ideas don't seem to be arranged as exactingly or as excitingly as they were on <i>Universal Indians</i>, which is another way of saying the new songs aren't as strong. By embedding free-form noise into traditional song shapes, they made classic rock sound exotic and made the conceptual sound earthily accessible. But on <i>Truce Opium</i>, the songs are almost carelessly loose, with no recognizable elements to tether their jamming or shape their noise. ""When the Shelter Came"" twists and tangles itself melodically, initially coming across as anthemic before eventually wandering off into an extended horn break and then collapsing. It sounds unfinished; the shelter never comes.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Still, the novelty of such an unwieldy lineup translates into a distinctively dense sound, so that even when <i>Truce Opium</i> feels unmoored and aimless, the sheer force of Dark Meat comes through clearly, as on ""The Faint Smell of Moss"" and the short, spastic ""Yonderin'"", two of the most lucid songs here. Ironically, the best track may be one of the longest: After a rambling intro, the 10-minute ""No One Was There"" breaks down into an extended drum-rooted jam punctuated by an ascending theme that makes an effective hook for 10 minutes. Dark Meat still play it as loudly as possible, which compensates for so many shortcomings.</p>

Their debut full-length, 2007's <i>Beartrap Island</i>, was tricked out with all manner of art-pop production flourishes, but all the atmospheric whooshes and vaguely dubby drum sounds in the world couldn't disguise the good ol' cornfed American emo heart beating at the music's center. When they stuck with this basic impulse, they gathered momentum; the rest of the time, they lingered in muddier waters, coming across as a better-than-average average rock band with some grand ambitions.</p>
<p>Their second full-length, <i>Visitation</i>, doubles down on the art-rock signifiers, which means, unfortunately, it also doubles the production effects-- those whooshes are now accompanied by billowing synths, glitchy bursts of noise, sirenlike blares, and seven or eight different vocal filters. It's a somewhat disorienting look for what is basically meat-and-potatoes guitar rock, and it doesn't do these guys many favors.  The scrapyard drums of opener ""Reservoir"" immediately set the agenda. ""Devil Light"", meanwhile, is pockmarked with slowed-tape noises and bursts of static, with harp and celesta glimmering in the background, and yet it still sounds what it is-- a nice-enough midtempo rocker. The same goes for ""Carrier""; despite a massive wall of synths quivering in the background, the vocal melody is straight prom slow-dance material, right down to the softly glowing saxophone solo.</p>
<p>Division Day don't write bad songs, or ones that lack hooks or decent melodies. The problem is that this stuff is just too smooth and inoffensive for its layers upon layers of studio trickery. Even on the off moments when the band manages to work up some abrasive energy, Rohner Segnitz's glassy, featureless voice pours a big pot of Sleepytime Tea all over it-- see ""Malachite"", which manages to sound vaguely King Crimson-esque right up until the exact moment the vocals enter. Too much of <i>Visitation</i> lingers in draggy, po-faced ballads, making the false equation between slowing down and Saying Something Important.</p>
<p>The brisk, thrumming ""Reservoir"", which recalls the martial thrust of Bloc Party's ""Like Eating Glass"", is one of the album's most invigorating moments, and <i>Visitation</i> could use more of them. ""Surrender"", another of the record's handful of uptempo numbers, is also one of the only songs that benefits from its processed sound, its clanking industrial drums recalling a more streamlined version of Radiohead's ""15 Step"". Most of the time, though, the record's stagey atmosphere does little service to Division Day's earnest melodic gifts, and it reminds me of the Promise Ring's ill-advised bid for art-pop legitimacy with 2002's snoozy <i>Wood/Water</i>. Division Day would be doing us a favor with the more straightforward route next time; the world needs reliable emo bands more than it needs charisma-challenged art-rock hopefuls.</p></div>"|13689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13689-visitation/|6.2|Jayson Greene

Since 2004, he's been releasing his home recordings as Digital Leather, seeming to court perpetual obscurity. His music fits squarely into an arcane lineage of indie-rock bands who combine awkward vocals, lyrics that run the gamut from weird to transgressive, and oddly-shaped instrumental parts into unaccountably catchy songs: The Frogs, Mink Lungs, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, My Dad Is Dead. In other words, he's <i>sui generis</i>, fitting in only with other acts defined by not fitting in.</p>
<p>Foree's up to his usual tricks on his first Fat Possum album, squeezing a Nazi reference and a gay joke into the title alone (look it up), and inscribing it on an old guy's chest for bonus lulz. That's offensive on so many levels, but at the same time, it's hard to get worked up about, because it's trying so hard for shock value. You don't get the feeling that Foree is really a Nazi homophobe, just a louche IRL-troll with a sense of humor stuck in South Park. Nevertheless, <i>Warm Brother</i> threatens to win him a wider audience. While it's still off-kilter garage- and indie-rock with a blown-out electronic sheen, it's his first album recorded in an actual studio, and from the tootling shlock of ""Your Hand, My Glove"" to the M83-in-a-garbage-can stomper ""Not Now"", the songs really pop. It still feels defiantly niche, even as it alludes to better-known acts. The album recalls the submerged, piecemeal anthems of early Guided by Voices and the hoarse-throated barnburners of Wolf Parade (see ""Kisses"", with its chant-like vocal exhortations, and flat-footed drums thwacking through ringing chords). And the lyrics are actually pretty sweet.</p>
<p>They're also negligible. Foree's voice is nothing special-- a deep, level croon-- and while he cooks up some indelible vocal melodies, the music is the main attraction here. The drums detonate and echo like mortar rounds in a canyon; the infectious guitar parts explore gnarled acres of timbre and distortion; and the synths-- good god, the synths. They roar and spark and rip holes in the music in a way that instantly elevates offhanded ditties into four-alarm blazes. ""Photo Lie"" blends guitar-fuzz and keyboard-fuzz into an indistinguishably pounding mass. But the best songs exploit the contrast between quiet guitars and loud electronics, seeming to actually explode in Foree's hands. ""All the People"" starts off as a blocky folk strummer, before a chewed-up synth line pops out, and in ""Bugs on Glue"", a side-winding riff-fest spills riotously out of an anxious tape-manipulated haze. The balance between carefully fitted parts and their edge-of-danger deployment keeps us on thrillingly unsteady footing for the album's duration. It's a kitschy, shticky, charming curio.</p></div>"|13511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13511-warm-brother/|7.3|Brian Howe

Take out the earbuds and let it fill a space: This is music that's bigger than your iPod-- music you'll want to feel all around you.</p>
<p>Though not quite coming out of nowhere, <i>BRFM</i> seems like a surprise gift-- a striking consolidation of the spiky psych-prog tendencies of their debut into a pop framework.  In terms of career gear-shifts, the move Caribou made with <i>Andorra</i> is the most recent precedent.  Though at 41 minutes the album is economical and sharp in its execution, the band-- all from Georgia and Alabama-- still imbues its compositions with the generosity of spirit that makes the best Southern rock so invigorating.  ""Beast in Peace"" opens the record with a gentle lockstep before shifting seamlessly into a mile-wide chorus. Then, they expand <i>that </i>chorus even further, like switching to the widest camera lens to capture a vista they just realized the full vastness of. Elsewhere, as its title indicates, ""Ultimate Satisfaction"" is an IMAX-wide ode to what starts out as a simple thought, then turns bodily-- the refrain of ""coming down!"" charts the sensation spreading like a spasm.  That towering exultation is also felt on the primal ""Deafening Love"". While aiming for a similar sense of awe-inspiring bliss, ""Love"" widens the focus and luxuriates in the tremors, approximating a more protracted take on Jane's Addiction's ""Mountain Song"".</p>
<p>Yet Bear in Heaven's greatest trick is creating music that evokes the sort of physicality and scope that could soundtrack a Hollywood film, but also works equally well at stirring up intimate bodily passion.  Lush synth beds, warm electronics accenting polyrhythms, and Jon Philpot's yearning, boyish howl coalesce into a vibe that's muscular without being macho, and which strikes a rare balance between nuanced emotion and overwhelming sensation.  Even when delving into more disconcerting subject matter-- dabbling in self-loathing on ""Wholehearted Mess"" or confronting paranoia on the slinky ""You Do You""-- Philpot still manages to imbue the songs with an atmosphere of seduction and intrigue.</p>
<p>An album like <i>BRFM</i> couldn't exist without a paean to the most severe and high-stakes of endeavors, and first single ""Lovesick Teenagers"" more than meets the requirements for 2009's Epic Song About Tortured Young Romance. With briskly alternating synth chords spitting by like fast-moving highway stripes, the titular couple are doomed to crash, but most likely in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_%281973_novel%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JG Ballard sort of way</a>. The pair martyr themselves in order to eternalize their passion, and the band is generous enough to resurrect them later, in the reprise of ""Teenagers"" that closes the album, seamlessly and surprisingly emerging from ""Casual Goodbye"". As a gesture, it's a slight nod backwards to the suite-like structures of their debut, but moreoever a celebration of abundance that wraps up an album overflowing with feeling.  It's also an exclamation point signaling that Bear in Heaven not only clearly recognize their own best instincts, they're not shy about dwelling on them. Sure, bands can adapt to the current musical climate by adding extras to LPs, tweaking release dates to accommodate fan interest, or even giving away their music free.  A curtain call like ""Teenagers"", though: now <i>that's</i> generosity.</p></div>"|13618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13618-beast-rest-forth-mouth/|8.4|Eric Harvey

Since then, three of those bands flailed about: Metallica went the radio route, Megadeth tried to do the same, and Anthrax turned to hard rock. Slayer, on the other hand, remained Slayer. They kept their core ingredients: spiky tonalities, no-frills thrash laced with punk, and lyrical obsessions with serial murderers and blasphemy. But after 1990's <i>Seasons in the Abyss</i>, the Slayer team underwent turmoil. Drummer Dave Lombardo left, producer Rick Rubin reduced his participation to executive production, and cover artist Larry Carroll didn't get called back. The band fell off for several albums, generating a few great songs and a lot of filler. The return of Lombardo on 2006's  <i>Christ Illusion</i> helped right the band somewhat.</p>
<p>Now Slayer are fully functioning again-- and it's hard to believe that a 27-year-old band can be this intense. <i>World Painted Blood</i> races through 11 tracks in 40 almost fat-free minutes. Slayer haven't written a great slow song since ""Seasons in the Abyss"", but the few that are here break up the album nicely. The rest of the record is fast and finely controlled. Hooks peek through often, and the interplay between guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman is lively. Their trademark whinnying-horse solos are intact, and Lombardo still pushes the beat hard. ""Unit 731"" features some of his best drumming ever, with delightfully crackling fills. An extremely dry mix practically brings the listener into the room next to the band. This performance aspect is crucial to Slayer's success. Unlike, Metallica, whose drummer Lars Ulrich is inconsistent live, or Megadeth, who have settled into a monotonous precision, Slayer have retained their organic energy. They are one of the most electrifying musical units working today.</p>
<p>This upfront sound is double-edged, however. It's thrilling to hear the band in such close audio quarters. But as a result, it loses some mystique. The production quirks of past albums helped give Slayer an aura. <i>Hell Awaits</i>, for example, indeed sounded hellish due to an excess of reverb. The tedious sludge of <i>Diabolus in Musica</i> had a certain charm. Although Rick Rubin's production on Slayer's classic trilogy (<i>Reign in Blood</i>, <i>South of Heaven</i>, <i>Seasons in the Abyss</i>) was dry, the songs still had a smoke-rising-in-the-distance quality. Now the band is aurally inches away from one's face. Additionally, the band has turned its attention from the underworld to the real world. ""Americon"", for example, condemns the U.S.' blood-for-oil foreign policy. Slayer being timely is not Slayer being timeless. But the way they're still playing, they sure sound like it.</p></div>"|13673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13673-world-painted-blood/|7.3|Cosmo Lee

There was a great deal of affinity between the scenes in Nigeria and Ghana during that era, owing in part to their shared history of British colonization and the free flow of people back and forth between the two nations. During a period of exile, Nigerian Afrobeat king Fela Kuti sheltered in Ghana, and many of Ghana's musicians did stints in Lagos and other Nigerian cities. The horn-heavy dance band highlife sound that developed in Ghana was easily exported by E.T. Mensah to Nigeria in the 50s, and the two countries keep up their musical dialogue even today.</p>
<p>So now Soundway gives us <i>Ghana Special</i>, a two-disc, 33-track companion to the Nigerian volume and a successor to the label's two <i>Ghana Soundz</i> compilations from several years ago. Where <i>Ghana Soundz</i> focused on heavy funk and Afrobeat, this draws from a much wider spectrum, providing a panorama of the country's pop music. The influences range from local rhythms and age-old songs and the divergent palm-wine and big band highlife styles of Ghana itself to American blues, soul, and funk, European and American rock and psych (the Barbecues quote ""Black Magic Woman"" in the organ solo of ""Aaya Lolo""), Cuban pachanga, and Nigerian Afrobeat. The cycling guitars of highlife are sometimes tinged with a bit of wah pedal, and wild analog synthesizers rub shoulders with hand drums whose design hasn't changed in centuries. Highlife's two strains-- the upper class big bands with their horn sections and lower-class palm-wine with its simple guitars and socially observant lyrics-- essentially merged during this period, as record players became widespread, economic decline made it tough to keep the big bands together, and technology changed everything.</p>
<p>Some names are familiar. Collectors of these compilations will recognize the African Brothers, TO Jazz, the Sweet Talks, K. Frimpong, Ebo Taylor, Mercury Dance Band, Uhuru Dance Band, Gyedu-Blay Ambolley, and others (including a guest shot on sax by Fela Kuti backing Basa Basa Soundz), but there are plenty of other names that will be new even to the well-versed. The Barbecues, Boombaya, Pagadeja, the Wellis Band, St. Peter &amp; the Holymen and Houghas Sorowonko aren't exactly well known, even to enthusiasts. The liner notes are stuffed with biographical and collector wonk information, shedding light on just how extensive the music industry was in Ghana before its collapse in 1981. For a collector, it's a treasure trove of backstory-- I've had K. Gyasi and Kyeremateng Atwede albums for years, and now I finally know who these people were.</p>
<p>It's hard to put a foot wrong when stepping into the tracklisting. Christy Azuma &amp; Uppers International supply ethereal Afrobeat on ""Din Ya Sugri"", the Sweet Talks get sweetly funky on ""Akampanye"", the members of Pagadeja have fun imitating animal noises on ""Tamale"", and we get to hear Hedzoleh Sounds, known in the West primarily for the record they cut backing South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela, on their own, laying down a couple of mean grooves and getting crazy with a Jew's harp. ""Bukom"", by Oscar Sulley's Nezele Sounds, brilliantly showcases Sulley's arranging skills, pitting an army of traditional drums against thundering brass-- if I ran a good college marching band program, I'd be slipping this in to the repertoire to blow some minds at half-time. Soundway's Miles Cleret also includes K. Frimpong's stone classic ""Kyenkyen Bi Adi M'Awu"", which here sounds far more cleaned up and clear than any remastering I've previously heard, be it on a cassette from Ghana or Kona's excellent 2002 <i>Afro-Rock, Vol.1</i> compilation, where it made its Western debut.</p>
<p>The long instrumental intro to Vis-A-Vis's ""Obi Agye Me Dofo"" is very nearly a cover of ""Kyenkyen"", and they share a type of syncopated, hopping beat that seems unique to Ghanaian records-- it's heard several times here, including on Ebo Taylor's ""Twer Nyame"". Though no two songs handle it exactly the same way, it's something of a national rhythmic stamp that's instantly addictive. And that's one reason that Soundway had to make a Ghanaian companion to <i>Nigeria Special</i>: As intertwined as the countries' music could be, neither scene was subordinate to the other, and this music is distinctly Ghanaian. In any event, <i>Ghana Special</i> offers a spoil of riches you can dance to in any language.</p></div>"|13649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13649-ghana-special-modern-highlife-afro-sounds-ghanaian-blues-1968-1981/|8.5|Joe Tangari

They like grandly marching percussion, swirling orchestration, and frequent crescendos. Their vocals are stirring but stiff: Lusty chants, murmurs, and held notes fill out sweeping choral arrangements, mostly devoid of melisma and swing. Compensating for the slight stuffiness is a certain breed of indie gravitas-- they clap their hands and close their eyes and lift their faces to the sky with convincing reverence. If Under Byen, another Danish band who collaborated with an orchestra (on <i>Siamesisk</i>), are Denmark's Sonic Youth, then Efterklang are its Arcade Fire, with a bit of Sufjan Stevens' rootsy chamber music for good measure.</p>
<p>Under Byen are good, but they have a sneaky, disturbing sound. Efterklang are Denmark's most world-class indie band, and they seem acutely aware of it, wearing the mantle of cultural ambassador heavily. From debut album <i>Tripper </i>to <i>Parades </i>to <i>Performing Parades</i>, a live recording of their sophomore album with the Danish National Chamber Orchestra, they've charted a bourgeois-friendly course from post-rock to orchestral-rock to classical. <i>Performing Parades </i>is beautifully played and immaculately recorded-- only the well-bred applause betrays its live status. However, the music was a lot to take in before the orchestra was added, and now, it blurs the line between pageantry and pandering. From the sorrowing piano of ""Mimeo"" to the towering string trills of ""Illuminant"", the music is monotonously epic. It's like one dramatic image stretched feature-length: The hero on the cliff, jaw jutting, with his cloak blowing romantically in the wind, for a solid hour.</p>
<p>Still, there are many wonderful moments on <i>Performing Parades</i> that inspire undiluted awe. On ""Polygyne"", the orchestra lays low during the tense verses, then pushes into the mounting vocal harmonies with gusty strings and horns, to goosebumpy effect. ""Mirador"", already a very pretty song, becomes even prettier with weepy strings in counterpoint to its staggered vocal refrains. ""Frida Found a Friend"", which was originally a sort of organic IDM track, benefits from the added thickness and weight. It's just that after a few tracks, all the blood-pumping orchestration gets banal, almost deadening. The many opportunities for subtly recasting the songs are mostly ignored, in favor of high-piled fanfare. The whole thing starts sounding like postmodern holiday music, darkly chipper and overwrought-- something like Haydn's <i>Toy Symphony,</i> but with big drums and elves chanting about birds doing inspiring things on top of it. Gorgeous, but the pomp overloads the circumstance.</p></div>"|13653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13653-performing-parades/|5.7|Brian Howe

If the French-house headbangers wanted to show they could weld metal's gothic nightmarishness onto disco's giddy dancefloor excess, they could hardly have made a better symbolic choice. After creating classic film soundtracks for horror auteur Dario Argento with Goblin starting in the mid-1970s, keyboard player Claudio Simonetti went on to help pioneer what is now lovingly known as Italo disco. Horror, disco-- okay, you've met.</p>
<p>If cinematic scariness and electronic dance music were ever strange bedfellows, they certainly aren't anymore. Since ""Phantom"", Justice-style floor pummelers from Kavinsky to CFCF have acknowledged Goblin's influence. The band itself reunited for European live shows and a new album in recent years. And the guys behind German house and techno label Kompakt just started a new imprint, Fright, citing Goblin's Simonetti and <i>Halloween</i> film-scorer John Carpenter as touchstones. Within this burgeoning micro-movement, Venice's William Bottin has shown moments of demonic mastery, but his full-length debut, <i>Horror Disco</i>, rarely makes you jump out of your seat.</p>
<p>Wielding a Farfisa Syntorchestra synth like a slasher-movie villain brandishing a murder weapon, Bottin comes up with an album that is more about a spooky mood and quirky sonics than hypnotically pristine repetitions. No surprise, then, that excellent single ""No Static"" first emerged on darkly atmospheric New Jersey label Italians Do It Better; spacey arpeggios interlap and unfold seamlessly, subtle cries of ""don't stop"" and ""can do it"" giving this the feel of a contender for Nike's ""Run"" series. ""Sciarando El Scuro"" is the most ear-catching track after ""No Static"", its chirpy hook less poltergeist than poultry-geist.</p>
<p>From there, <i>Horror Disco</i> remains deeply reverent of horror and retro-futurist film music, with plenty of solid grooves to offer DJs, but not quite enough personality to make for a completely satisfying home listen. The stuttering rhythms and horn fanfares of ""Venezia Violenta"", the <i>Halloween</i>-esque repetitions of ominous finale ""Endless Mother"", and the creepy vocoder warnings of ""Slashdance"" are never unpleasant, but they're not exactly thrilling, either. Underscoring <i>Horror Disco</i>'s revivalist tendencies is ""Disco for the Devil"", which features matter-of-fact mayhem from Douglas Meakin, who sang for some of Simonetti's Italo disco projects.</p>
<p>As (dig the name) Black Devil Disco Club have shown, nu-disco doesn't have to be novel to be good, but it should usually be entertaining. <i>Horror Disco</i> proves Bottin knows his craft, and the standout tracks are worthwhile even for Italo disco noobs, but there's too much dull drift here to let me recommend it unreservedly for your 2010 Halloween party-- especially with so much similarly minded disco spookiness out there. After all, at 78 minutes, <i>Horror Disco</i> is already eight minutes longer than the Flaming Lips' sprawling new double-album. As great as <i>Embryonic</i> is, that's still a little scary.</p></div>"|13663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13663-horror-disco/|6.1|Marc Hogan

Venerable Berlin techno imprint Get Physical is turning seven, while the even more beloved Cologne label Kompakt is 10. In the fickle world of electronic music, any anniversary it seems is worth noting. Warp Records-- at 20, almost as old as all three put together-- is doing it right with an expansive, expensive-looking (and, ok, expensive) box set, some elements of which are available separately.</p>
<p>Let's be frank about the overall package: It is in no way for the casual fan. But was it ever going to be? Warp, aware that a 20th anniversary collection couldn't work as both an introduction and a want/need item for its rabid fans, wisely went all in on the latter. If music is now, to many, free, and the draw of a music product is everything but the music, Warp embraced this dilemma: Yes / Dan Holdsworth (designers of the box itself) and the label's longtime visual collaborators at the Designers Republic (who are responsible for much of the art inside of it) have created what amounts to a fetish object. Housed in a 10"" slipcase, this thing has physical heft; and with a 192-page book detailing the complete visual history to date of the label, the full Warp set looks more like an item for your shelf. Even the CDs are housed in case-bound 10"" folders rather than delicate little sleeves.</p>
<p>Inside the box, aside from the perfect-bound book, are five sets of music, three of which are also available on their own. <i>Warp20 (Chosen)</i>, is a 2xCD set featuring 10 songs selected by warp.net users (from a pre-selected pool) and 10 selected by Warp co-founder Steve Beckett. <i>Warp20 (Recreated)</i> is a 2xCD collection of new covers of Warp songs by Warp artists. Each of those are out now. <i>Warp20 (Unheard)</i>-- which comes in the box as a 3x10"" set but starting November 9 will be available on its own as a single CD or LP (<a href=""http://warp.net/records/warp20/unheard-out-now-on-cd-and-digital"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as well as included as a digital add-on for box-set purchasers</a>)-- is an 11-song gathering of unreleased tracks from Warp stars such as Boards of Canada, Autechre, Broadcast, and Plaid. Also included in the box is <i>Warp20 (Elemental)</i>, a 65-minute mix of Warp songs by Osymsyo, and <i>Warp20 (Infinite)</i>, a 2x10"" set of locked grooves.</p>
<p>The original packaging for Warp's IDM template <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> wondered, ""Are you sitting comfortably?"" before claiming that the record of home-listening electronic music was for, among other things, ""quiet nights."" The same could be said of this set, which works best when you allow yourself to live in it, to fully explore the label rather than simply skim off the top of it. That's true of any vinyl experience to a degree, but Warp's collection is a true pairing of art and sound, rather than one being supplemental to the other. The steady avoidance of fashionable, ephemeral stylistic choices in favor of clean, classic lines and colors makes the look of the set seem remarkably timeless and universal. This is particularly impressive for an electronic imprint, which avoided the temptation to look futuristic or <i>au courant</i>, and has allowed the label to retain a look from earliest singles by Forgemasters and Nightmares on Wax through their 10th and now 20th anniversary sets.</p>
<p>When Warp did this whole thing 10 years ago, before the full impact of file-sharing, the music was the thing. Back then, Warp compiled three 2xCD sets-- one of non-Warp techno and house classics, mostly from the half-decade that immediately preceded their label's launch; one of the label's top work; and one of Warp artists remixing songs from the Warp catalogue. If you somehow have not yet heard Warp's music, that actually might be a better place to start, since you'll therefore almost certainly not have also heard the Chicago and Detroit pioneers that populate that set's first disc.</p>
<p>But it's also true that Warp in part succeeded because it hasn't been beholden and overly reverent to the pioneers of techno and house. It avoided the dead end of traditionalism by both breaking from electronic music's dancefloor utilitarianism and embracing artists with wit and charisma over the sometimes monochromatic communalism favored by techno's more faceless producers. It's no surprise then that Warp found many fans outside of dance: Its colorful music tends to emphasize shifts and melodies and complex rhythm structures over the more subtle builds and crescendos of repetitive dance. As Warp has became an influence on rock and hip-hop-- Radiohead most famously championed the label around the turn of the millennium-- the label wisely invited pop-structured acts that carried the spirit and sensibility of electronic music into its fold. It now boasts a roster of not only top-notch electronic producers but also the fussy, prim indie of Grizzly Bear, the loose-limbed modern soul of Jamie Lidell, the haunted, avant-pop of Broadcast, and the askew hip-hop and wonky of Flying Lotus.</p>
<p>Picking out highlights from the 20 years would be nearly impossible, so thankfully the label has done it for me. The half of <i>Warp20 (Chosen)</i> selected by fans is music of extremely high quality, but it is also the least essential aspect of the box set. If you're interested in paying for the set, or even if you're interested in adventurous modern music, you're probably pretty well versed in most of its contents. The <a href=""http://www.warp20.net/?offset=0&amp;max=20&amp;chart=2&amp;c_offset=20&amp;v_offset=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">results of the vote</a> provided the 10 tracks here, and unfortunately older tracks were undervalued, and arguably novelty was overvalued.</p>
<p>The fan vote disc is complemented by a disc of tracks chosen by Beckett, which breaks up some of the predictability of the choices and thankfully provides spots for first-decade favorites like Nightmares on Wax, Seefeel, and Black Dog Productions (here recording as Xeper). Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Battles, and Aphex Twin make second appearances on the set, but those Beckett-chosen selections provide alternate looks at the work of each, and aren't obvious song selections. The exclusion of more primitive early tracks from artists like Sweet Exorcist, Forgemasters, and Tricky Disco is slightly regrettable. But considering that Warp10's best of, <i>Warp10+2</i>, was limited to tracks from 1989-92 it makes some sense, allowing these discs to work practically as a <i>Volume 2</i> to that set, with only LFO's ""LFO (Leeds Warehouse Mix)"" and Nightmare on Wax's ""I'm for Real"" appearing on both.</p>
<p><i>Warp20 (Recreated)</i> is the most grab-baggy thing here, at times leaving you wondering why this is a set of covers rather than remixes (see Luke Vibert's take on ""LFO"" for one). Not surprisingly, the tracks here work best when artists start with material that isn't within their comfort zone. Nightmares on Wax's slinky version of the stiff ""Hey Hey Can U Relate?"" is a marvel. Elsewhere, Mira Calix and Autechre manage to re-work Boards of Canada and LFO, respectively, without losing either a sense of the original or their own sensibilities. Gravenhurst's take on Broadcast's ""I Found the F"" and Born Ruffians' deconstruction of Aphex Twin's ""Milkman/To Cure a Weakling Child"" are odd clashes on paper that turn out to be highlights. Leila continues the decade-long rehabilitation of Aphex Twin's <i>Drukqs</i> album with a moody, hollow, piano-led take on ""Vordhosbn"", while Jimi Tenor is one of the few artists here who unearthed a relatively lost gem with his redo of Drexciya-related project Elecktroids' ""Japanese Electronics"". More on-the-nose things like Jamie Lidell's take on Grizzly Bear's ""Little Brother"" or Tim Exile's take on Lidell's ""A Little Bit More"" don't seem necessary.</p>
<p>Osymyso's mix provides a solid overview of the whole label, highlighting the strong universal sensibilities of the founders. Best known for providing himself rigid constructs (his ""Intro-Inspection"" takes the starts of 100 pop songs and combines them into one 12-minute marvel) and changing out tracks quickly, here Osymyso wisely relaxes and lets the tracks play. Warp devotees can still enjoy trainspotting song titles, but if things moved at the pace of some of Osymyso's other work it wouldn't give the less initiated a chance to catch up and locate sounds and shifts. With deft pacing and relative seamless mixing, it also rewards long after that first listen.</p>
<p>The unreleased set, <i>Warp20 (Unheard), </i>is limited to 11 well-chosen tracks. The new Boards of Canada song ""Seven Forty Seven"" sounds like Boards of Canada and you're reminded why these guys own this hazy, nostalgic sound. Broadcast, too, have tossed aside the retro albatross and become one of the more singular and consistently excellent artists of our time, and their contribution, ""Sixty Forty"", keeps the winning streak going. Clark provides the too-short ""Rattlesnake"", Flying Lotus stretches out a bit on the bleary-eyed ""Tronix"", and Plaid and Nightmares on Wax each provide a pair of songs. The most consistent record in sound and tone, <i>Warp20 (Unheard)</i> recalls the feel of the <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> comps that helped secure Warp's fame.</p>
<p>The locked grooves disc, <i>Warp20 (Infinite)</i>, is obviously a specialty item. But with so many of these tracks built on repetition to start, it's a natural albeit esoteric fit. And if you ever wanted to play ""Atlas"" by Battles or ""On"" by Aphex Twin forever, now you can. Hilariously, this leaked as mp3s for some reason.</p>
<p>Warp has long staked out its own ground online, fussy and protective of its product. The label opened its own Warpmart early in the digital music era rather than do so via a third party, and it doesn't seem to subscribe to the idea that just offering free shit all over the web is good for its artists. Part of the reason is Warp's big wigs care about sound and presentation, and it shows. <i>Warp20 (Box)</i> is another reminder of the thought that goes into what they do-- not just the records they release, but the total package of the label. It's one reason they've survived for two decades.</p>
<p>Another reason, aside from the obvious (a good ear; a willingness to regard their artists as family, giving them license to record at their own pace without regard for their bankability), is that they've slowly and organically adapted to the growing indie and dance worlds. Nominally known first as a center for the blippier end of rave, and then as the home of IDM, Warp has made wise, cautious steps toward embracing other sounds and styles. IDM itself, seen as a fad with a sneered-at tag, has proved endurable. Indeed, one of the stories of indie this decade is that mocked sounds from the margins-- freak-folk, dance-punk, electroclash/nu-rave-- wound up becoming central to the whole. IDM is practically the grandfather of this trend, and the best of its music outlasted the name, until the textures and sounds that once necessitated new descriptions no longer had to be boxed in. If Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Authechre, Black Dog/Plaid, and Aphex Twin may have once been IDM musicians, today they're just individual artists making beloved music, more known for their own singular styles than as part of an umbrella trend.</p>
<p>Warp has outlasted conceptual and contextual constructs in ways that are rare in the electronic world, where music is often tagged as easily dated. Throughout Warp's history, care in the construction of sound is important, so are syncopated rhythms, wit and whimsy, and the blending the abstract and the melodic. In the end, that there are no shortcuts to defining a Warp sound; that they are a fully trusted brand name that doesn't embrace 21st century eclecticism for the hell of it is admirable and rare. It may have been unthinkable 20 years ago that an electronic music imprint would still be around today, but it's no surprise Warp made it. And if music labels are still around in another 20, it would be no surprise if Warp was one of the survivors of these times as well.</p></div>"|13668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13668-warp20-box-set-warp20-chosen-warp20-recreated-warp20-unheard/|9.2|Scott Plagenhoef

Venerable Berlin techno imprint Get Physical is turning seven, while the even more beloved Cologne label Kompakt is 10. In the fickle world of electronic music, any anniversary it seems is worth noting. Warp Records-- at 20, almost as old as all three put together-- is doing it right with an expansive, expensive-looking (and, ok, expensive) box set, some elements of which are available separately.</p>
<p>Let's be frank about the overall package: It is in no way for the casual fan. But was it ever going to be? Warp, aware that a 20th anniversary collection couldn't work as both an introduction and a want/need item for its rabid fans, wisely went all in on the latter. If music is now, to many, free, and the draw of a music product is everything but the music, Warp embraced this dilemma: Yes / Dan Holdsworth (designers of the box itself) and the label's longtime visual collaborators at the Designers Republic (who are responsible for much of the art inside of it) have created what amounts to a fetish object. Housed in a 10"" slipcase, this thing has physical heft; and with a 192-page book detailing the complete visual history to date of the label, the full Warp set looks more like an item for your shelf. Even the CDs are housed in case-bound 10"" folders rather than delicate little sleeves.</p>
<p>Inside the box, aside from the perfect-bound book, are five sets of music, three of which are also available on their own. <i>Warp20 (Chosen)</i>, is a 2xCD set featuring 10 songs selected by warp.net users (from a pre-selected pool) and 10 selected by Warp co-founder Steve Beckett. <i>Warp20 (Recreated)</i> is a 2xCD collection of new covers of Warp songs by Warp artists. Each of those are out now. <i>Warp20 (Unheard)</i>-- which comes in the box as a 3x10"" set but starting November 9 will be available on its own as a single CD or LP (<a href=""http://warp.net/records/warp20/unheard-out-now-on-cd-and-digital"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as well as included as a digital add-on for box-set purchasers</a>)-- is an 11-song gathering of unreleased tracks from Warp stars such as Boards of Canada, Autechre, Broadcast, and Plaid. Also included in the box is <i>Warp20 (Elemental)</i>, a 65-minute mix of Warp songs by Osymsyo, and <i>Warp20 (Infinite)</i>, a 2x10"" set of locked grooves.</p>
<p>The original packaging for Warp's IDM template <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> wondered, ""Are you sitting comfortably?"" before claiming that the record of home-listening electronic music was for, among other things, ""quiet nights."" The same could be said of this set, which works best when you allow yourself to live in it, to fully explore the label rather than simply skim off the top of it. That's true of any vinyl experience to a degree, but Warp's collection is a true pairing of art and sound, rather than one being supplemental to the other. The steady avoidance of fashionable, ephemeral stylistic choices in favor of clean, classic lines and colors makes the look of the set seem remarkably timeless and universal. This is particularly impressive for an electronic imprint, which avoided the temptation to look futuristic or <i>au courant</i>, and has allowed the label to retain a look from earliest singles by Forgemasters and Nightmares on Wax through their 10th and now 20th anniversary sets.</p>
<p>When Warp did this whole thing 10 years ago, before the full impact of file-sharing, the music was the thing. Back then, Warp compiled three 2xCD sets-- one of non-Warp techno and house classics, mostly from the half-decade that immediately preceded their label's launch; one of the label's top work; and one of Warp artists remixing songs from the Warp catalogue. If you somehow have not yet heard Warp's music, that actually might be a better place to start, since you'll therefore almost certainly not have also heard the Chicago and Detroit pioneers that populate that set's first disc.</p>
<p>But it's also true that Warp in part succeeded because it hasn't been beholden and overly reverent to the pioneers of techno and house. It avoided the dead end of traditionalism by both breaking from electronic music's dancefloor utilitarianism and embracing artists with wit and charisma over the sometimes monochromatic communalism favored by techno's more faceless producers. It's no surprise then that Warp found many fans outside of dance: Its colorful music tends to emphasize shifts and melodies and complex rhythm structures over the more subtle builds and crescendos of repetitive dance. As Warp has became an influence on rock and hip-hop-- Radiohead most famously championed the label around the turn of the millennium-- the label wisely invited pop-structured acts that carried the spirit and sensibility of electronic music into its fold. It now boasts a roster of not only top-notch electronic producers but also the fussy, prim indie of Grizzly Bear, the loose-limbed modern soul of Jamie Lidell, the haunted, avant-pop of Broadcast, and the askew hip-hop and wonky of Flying Lotus.</p>
<p>Picking out highlights from the 20 years would be nearly impossible, so thankfully the label has done it for me. The half of <i>Warp20 (Chosen)</i> selected by fans is music of extremely high quality, but it is also the least essential aspect of the box set. If you're interested in paying for the set, or even if you're interested in adventurous modern music, you're probably pretty well versed in most of its contents. The <a href=""http://www.warp20.net/?offset=0&amp;max=20&amp;chart=2&amp;c_offset=20&amp;v_offset=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">results of the vote</a> provided the 10 tracks here, and unfortunately older tracks were undervalued, and arguably novelty was overvalued.</p>
<p>The fan vote disc is complemented by a disc of tracks chosen by Beckett, which breaks up some of the predictability of the choices and thankfully provides spots for first-decade favorites like Nightmares on Wax, Seefeel, and Black Dog Productions (here recording as Xeper). Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Battles, and Aphex Twin make second appearances on the set, but those Beckett-chosen selections provide alternate looks at the work of each, and aren't obvious song selections. The exclusion of more primitive early tracks from artists like Sweet Exorcist, Forgemasters, and Tricky Disco is slightly regrettable. But considering that Warp10's best of, <i>Warp10+2</i>, was limited to tracks from 1989-92 it makes some sense, allowing these discs to work practically as a <i>Volume 2</i> to that set, with only LFO's ""LFO (Leeds Warehouse Mix)"" and Nightmare on Wax's ""I'm for Real"" appearing on both.</p>
<p><i>Warp20 (Recreated)</i> is the most grab-baggy thing here, at times leaving you wondering why this is a set of covers rather than remixes (see Luke Vibert's take on ""LFO"" for one). Not surprisingly, the tracks here work best when artists start with material that isn't within their comfort zone. Nightmares on Wax's slinky version of the stiff ""Hey Hey Can U Relate?"" is a marvel. Elsewhere, Mira Calix and Autechre manage to re-work Boards of Canada and LFO, respectively, without losing either a sense of the original or their own sensibilities. Gravenhurst's take on Broadcast's ""I Found the F"" and Born Ruffians' deconstruction of Aphex Twin's ""Milkman/To Cure a Weakling Child"" are odd clashes on paper that turn out to be highlights. Leila continues the decade-long rehabilitation of Aphex Twin's <i>Drukqs</i> album with a moody, hollow, piano-led take on ""Vordhosbn"", while Jimi Tenor is one of the few artists here who unearthed a relatively lost gem with his redo of Drexciya-related project Elecktroids' ""Japanese Electronics"". More on-the-nose things like Jamie Lidell's take on Grizzly Bear's ""Little Brother"" or Tim Exile's take on Lidell's ""A Little Bit More"" don't seem necessary.</p>
<p>Osymyso's mix provides a solid overview of the whole label, highlighting the strong universal sensibilities of the founders. Best known for providing himself rigid constructs (his ""Intro-Inspection"" takes the starts of 100 pop songs and combines them into one 12-minute marvel) and changing out tracks quickly, here Osymyso wisely relaxes and lets the tracks play. Warp devotees can still enjoy trainspotting song titles, but if things moved at the pace of some of Osymyso's other work it wouldn't give the less initiated a chance to catch up and locate sounds and shifts. With deft pacing and relative seamless mixing, it also rewards long after that first listen.</p>
<p>The unreleased set, <i>Warp20 (Unheard), </i>is limited to 11 well-chosen tracks. The new Boards of Canada song ""Seven Forty Seven"" sounds like Boards of Canada and you're reminded why these guys own this hazy, nostalgic sound. Broadcast, too, have tossed aside the retro albatross and become one of the more singular and consistently excellent artists of our time, and their contribution, ""Sixty Forty"", keeps the winning streak going. Clark provides the too-short ""Rattlesnake"", Flying Lotus stretches out a bit on the bleary-eyed ""Tronix"", and Plaid and Nightmares on Wax each provide a pair of songs. The most consistent record in sound and tone, <i>Warp20 (Unheard)</i> recalls the feel of the <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> comps that helped secure Warp's fame.</p>
<p>The locked grooves disc, <i>Warp20 (Infinite)</i>, is obviously a specialty item. But with so many of these tracks built on repetition to start, it's a natural albeit esoteric fit. And if you ever wanted to play ""Atlas"" by Battles or ""On"" by Aphex Twin forever, now you can. Hilariously, this leaked as mp3s for some reason.</p>
<p>Warp has long staked out its own ground online, fussy and protective of its product. The label opened its own Warpmart early in the digital music era rather than do so via a third party, and it doesn't seem to subscribe to the idea that just offering free shit all over the web is good for its artists. Part of the reason is Warp's big wigs care about sound and presentation, and it shows. <i>Warp20 (Box)</i> is another reminder of the thought that goes into what they do-- not just the records they release, but the total package of the label. It's one reason they've survived for two decades.</p>
<p>Another reason, aside from the obvious (a good ear; a willingness to regard their artists as family, giving them license to record at their own pace without regard for their bankability), is that they've slowly and organically adapted to the growing indie and dance worlds. Nominally known first as a center for the blippier end of rave, and then as the home of IDM, Warp has made wise, cautious steps toward embracing other sounds and styles. IDM itself, seen as a fad with a sneered-at tag, has proved endurable. Indeed, one of the stories of indie this decade is that mocked sounds from the margins-- freak-folk, dance-punk, electroclash/nu-rave-- wound up becoming central to the whole. IDM is practically the grandfather of this trend, and the best of its music outlasted the name, until the textures and sounds that once necessitated new descriptions no longer had to be boxed in. If Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Authechre, Black Dog/Plaid, and Aphex Twin may have once been IDM musicians, today they're just individual artists making beloved music, more known for their own singular styles than as part of an umbrella trend.</p>
<p>Warp has outlasted conceptual and contextual constructs in ways that are rare in the electronic world, where music is often tagged as easily dated. Throughout Warp's history, care in the construction of sound is important, so are syncopated rhythms, wit and whimsy, and the blending the abstract and the melodic. In the end, that there are no shortcuts to defining a Warp sound; that they are a fully trusted brand name that doesn't embrace 21st century eclecticism for the hell of it is admirable and rare. It may have been unthinkable 20 years ago that an electronic music imprint would still be around today, but it's no surprise Warp made it. And if music labels are still around in another 20, it would be no surprise if Warp was one of the survivors of these times as well.</p></div>"|13668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13668-warp20-box-set-warp20-chosen-warp20-recreated-warp20-unheard/|7.5|Scott Plagenhoef

As Warp has became an influence on rock and hip-hop-- Radiohead most famously championed the label around the turn of the millennium-- the label wisely invited pop-structured acts that carried the spirit and sensibility of electronic music into its fold. It now boasts a roster of not only top-notch electronic producers but also the fussy, prim indie of Grizzly Bear, the loose-limbed modern soul of Jamie Lidell, the haunted, avant-pop of Broadcast, and the askew hip-hop and wonky of Flying Lotus.</p>
<p>Picking out highlights from the 20 years would be nearly impossible, so thankfully the label has done it for me. The half of <i>Warp20 (Chosen)</i> selected by fans is music of extremely high quality, but it is also the least essential aspect of the box set. If you're interested in paying for the set, or even if you're interested in adventurous modern music, you're probably pretty well versed in most of its contents. The <a href=""http://www.warp20.net/?offset=0&amp;max=20&amp;chart=2&amp;c_offset=20&amp;v_offset=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">results of the vote</a> provided the 10 tracks here, and unfortunately older tracks were undervalued, and arguably novelty was overvalued.</p>
<p>The fan vote disc is complemented by a disc of tracks chosen by Beckett, which breaks up some of the predictability of the choices and thankfully provides spots for first-decade favorites like Nightmares on Wax, Seefeel, and Black Dog Productions (here recording as Xeper). Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Battles, and Aphex Twin make second appearances on the set, but those Beckett-chosen selections provide alternate looks at the work of each, and aren't obvious song selections. The exclusion of more primitive early tracks from artists like Sweet Exorcist, Forgemasters, and Tricky Disco is slightly regrettable. But considering that Warp10's best of, <i>Warp10+2</i>, was limited to tracks from 1989-92 it makes some sense, allowing these discs to work practically as a <i>Volume 2</i> to that set, with only LFO's ""LFO (Leeds Warehouse Mix)"" and Nightmare on Wax's ""I'm for Real"" appearing on both.</p>
<p><i>Warp20 (Recreated)</i> is the most grab-baggy thing here, at times leaving you wondering why this is a set of covers rather than remixes (see Luke Vibert's take on ""LFO"" for one). Not surprisingly, the tracks here work best when artists start with material that isn't within their comfort zone. Nightmares on Wax's slinky version of the stiff ""Hey Hey Can U Relate?"" is a marvel. Elsewhere, Mira Calix and Autechre manage to re-work Boards of Canada and LFO, respectively, without losing either a sense of the original or their own sensibilities. Gravenhurst's take on Broadcast's ""I Found the F"" and Born Ruffians' deconstruction of Aphex Twin's ""Milkman/To Cure a Weakling Child"" are odd clashes on paper that turn out to be highlights. Leila continues the decade-long rehabilitation of Aphex Twin's <i>Drukqs</i> album with a moody, hollow, piano-led take on ""Vordhosbn"", while Jimi Tenor is one of the few artists here who unearthed a relatively lost gem with his redo of Drexciya-related project Elecktroids' ""Japanese Electronics"". More on-the-nose things like Jamie Lidell's take on Grizzly Bear's ""Little Brother"" or Tim Exile's take on Lidell's ""A Little Bit More"" don't seem necessary.</p>
<p>Osymyso's mix provides a solid overview of the whole label, highlighting the strong universal sensibilities of the founders. Best known for providing himself rigid constructs (his ""Intro-Inspection"" takes the starts of 100 pop songs and combines them into one 12-minute marvel) and changing out tracks quickly, here Osymyso wisely relaxes and lets the tracks play. Warp devotees can still enjoy trainspotting song titles, but if things moved at the pace of some of Osymyso's other work it wouldn't give the less initiated a chance to catch up and locate sounds and shifts. With deft pacing and relative seamless mixing, it also rewards long after that first listen.</p>
<p>The unreleased set, <i>Warp20 (Unheard), </i>is limited to 11 well-chosen tracks. The new Boards of Canada song ""Seven Forty Seven"" sounds like Boards of Canada and you're reminded why these guys own this hazy, nostalgic sound. Broadcast, too, have tossed aside the retro albatross and become one of the more singular and consistently excellent artists of our time, and their contribution, ""Sixty Forty"", keeps the winning streak going. Clark provides the too-short ""Rattlesnake"", Flying Lotus stretches out a bit on the bleary-eyed ""Tronix"", and Plaid and Nightmares on Wax each provide a pair of songs. The most consistent record in sound and tone, <i>Warp20 (Unheard)</i> recalls the feel of the <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> comps that helped secure Warp's fame.</p>
<p>The locked grooves disc, <i>Warp20 (Infinite)</i>, is obviously a specialty item. But with so many of these tracks built on repetition to start, it's a natural albeit esoteric fit. And if you ever wanted to play ""Atlas"" by Battles or ""On"" by Aphex Twin forever, now you can. Hilariously, this leaked as mp3s for some reason.</p>
<p>Warp has long staked out its own ground online, fussy and protective of its product. The label opened its own Warpmart early in the digital music era rather than do so via a third party, and it doesn't seem to subscribe to the idea that just offering free shit all over the web is good for its artists. Part of the reason is Warp's big wigs care about sound and presentation, and it shows. <i>Warp20 (Box)</i> is another reminder of the thought that goes into what they do-- not just the records they release, but the total package of the label. It's one reason they've survived for two decades.</p>
<p>Another reason, aside from the obvious (a good ear; a willingness to regard their artists as family, giving them license to record at their own pace without regard for their bankability), is that they've slowly and organically adapted to the growing indie and dance worlds. Nominally known first as a center for the blippier end of rave, and then as the home of IDM, Warp has made wise, cautious steps toward embracing other sounds and styles. IDM itself, seen as a fad with a sneered-at tag, has proved endurable. Indeed, one of the stories of indie this decade is that mocked sounds from the margins-- freak-folk, dance-punk, electroclash/nu-rave-- wound up becoming central to the whole. IDM is practically the grandfather of this trend, and the best of its music outlasted the name, until the textures and sounds that once necessitated new descriptions no longer had to be boxed in. If Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Authechre, Black Dog/Plaid, and Aphex Twin may have once been IDM musicians, today they're just individual artists making beloved music, more known for their own singular styles than as part of an umbrella trend.</p>
<p>Warp has outlasted conceptual and contextual constructs in ways that are rare in the electronic world, where music is often tagged as easily dated. Throughout Warp's history, care in the construction of sound is important, so are syncopated rhythms, wit and whimsy, and the blending the abstract and the melodic. In the end, that there are no shortcuts to defining a Warp sound; that they are a fully trusted brand name that doesn't embrace 21st century eclecticism for the hell of it is admirable and rare. It may have been unthinkable 20 years ago that an electronic music imprint would still be around today, but it's no surprise Warp made it. And if music labels are still around in another 20, it would be no surprise if Warp was one of the survivors of these times as well.</p></div>"|13668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13668-warp20-box-set-warp20-chosen-warp20-recreated-warp20-unheard/|8.0|Scott Plagenhoef

He released only two solo full-lengths and an EP this decade, and those have been handily overshadowed by his hired-gun work with Martina Topley Bird, Melissa Auf der Maur, and the Baldwin Brothers, as well as his collaborations with Greg Dulli and Isobel Campbell. He could easily take the lead on any of these projects, but Lanegan seems to think we'll like him better in small doses. That, or he's planning a sort of <i>Yojimbo</i> double-cross that will pit the Twilight Singers against Belle and Sebastian.</p>
<p>Who knows where Soulsavers would come out in such a melee? The British duo-- Rich Machin and Ian Glover-- are something of an unknown quantity, especially on American shores. They formed in 2003 as an electronica outfit specializing in remixes for bands iike Starsailor and Doves. Their distinguishing characteristic seems to be their fascination with American traditional forms, texturing their songs with buzzy threads of blues, gospel, folk, and jazz. Reportedly, touring behind their second album, <i>It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land</i>, shifted their priorities even further, away from programmed beats and toward live instrumentation to create a cinematic atmosphere on <i>Broken</i>, their third album and second with Lanegan.</p>
<p>If <i>How Far You Fall</i> was formatted to fit your screen, then <i>Broken</i> is in CinemaScope. Spaghetti-western strings swell and shiver on ""Shadows Fall"", guitars grind vigorously on the Gene Clark cover ""Some Misunderstanding"", stray synthesizer blips shoot through ""Death Bells"" like sparks, and a lone piano provides an almost gothic solemnity on the Palace Brothers cover ""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"". The record features a sizable cast that includes Jason Pierce of Spiritualized, Mike Patton of Faith No More, Richard Hawley, and Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers, and Australian newcomer <span>Red Ghost, aka Rosa Agostino. </span>Entering late in the album, she makes a good supporting actress, her smooth voice a nice compliment to Lanegan's rougher textures on ""Rolling Sky"". Perhaps she'll get more screen time on the sequel.</p>
<p><span>Lanegan, however, remains our main protagonist, roaming Soulsavers' musical landscape mostly in isolation. </span>His miles-of-bad-road voice is an obvious match for Soulsavers' gothic Americanisms, and he sounds like just another instrument in their arsenal, communicating meaning via sound more than lyrics. That's a good use of him, especially when his lyrics veer toward Biblical overstatement, as on ""All the Way Down"" when he sings about ""crystalline dawn"" and ""six white horses."" Also, there's this gem from ""Can't Catch the Train"": ""Sure as the shovel is blind, deaf, and digging/ One day you're alone at the end of your road.""</p>
<p>And that's perhaps the problem with <i>Broken</i>: Too often its soundtrack atmosphere is too thick, its arrangements as obvious as a painted backdrop. The strings sound too much like Morricone, and ""Wise Blood"" recalls the quieter moments from Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman's score for <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> more than the John Huston movie. On ""Unbalanced Pieces"" the whispered backing vocals dogging Lanegan have all the spooky effect of a horror trailer, and the menacing bassline is both seedy and Bad Seed-y, which only reinforces the unflattering comparison with the recent soundtrack work of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. In trying to literalize the often dismissive term ""soundtrack rock,"" Soulsavers emphasize the former to the neglect of the latter.</p></div>"|13558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13558-broken/|6.3|Stephen M.

It was certainly an auspicious beginning for leader James Chapman: I could go on trying to nail down what his electronically composed, beat-minded UK singer-songwriter format seeks to accomplish, but I'll just leave it at this: I've heard no less than three of his songs at a Banana Republic or someplace similar. But right away, his limitations were readily apparent, and they were not the kind that typically improve with age. There was little evidence that he might expand the range of his whispered wheeze and use lyrics for something more than placeholders, write another melody as intuitive as the slam-dunk hook on ""To the Sky"", or create an arrangement as swoony as that of ""Lost My Soul"".</p>
<p><i>Turning the Mind</i> doesn't build on those successes so much as offer a sort of fake-out. It's a more aerodynamically composed album than <i>We Can Create</i>, though there's still plenty of shoegazy gravy for your earbuds to sop up. Hooked up to headphones, you can hear how the intro of ""I Dream of Crystal"" manages to evoke the bookends of M83's discography, combining the icy funk guitars of ""Couleurs"" with the saturated synth buzz of <i>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</i>. On the other hand, the most immediate hooks on <i>Turning the Mind</i> come from a <i>Saturdays=Youth</i> rip so baldfaced (""Everything Is Shattering""), you figure that it was allowed to slide only because the two are on the same label. Elsewhere, <i>Turning</i> feels more distinctly European than its predecessor-- Chapman and producer Tim Holmes (Death in Vegas) embrace prevalent influences like French touch and Kraftwerk, but elsewhere they skew too glowsticky. ""Let Go of the Fear"" (not to be confused with <i>We Can Create</i>'s ""Don't Fear"") is an embarrassing piece of <i>Matrix</i>-inspired cyberpunk dystopianism, while ""Love Will Come"" feels like little more than a five-minute vehicle for a two-second Faux-kenfold vocal trigger.</p>
<p>Whether or not <i>Turning the Mind</i> is a more personal work than <i>We Can Create</i> is debatable, but Chapman certainly invests himself more in the lyrics. He's said that the album was inspired by the therapy school of Mindfulness, but what you'll mostly notice is how much it seems to be about drugs. As is the usual case when people decide to start writing about drugs, there are plenty of awkward baby steps here-- I don't think I have to explain why the title of ""Chemeleon"" isn't a typo. The Vaseline-smeared ""Valium in the Sunshine"" comes off like a soft-focus ad for its titular subject (""You make me feel good/ Just like I should""), while the robo-Teutonic narrator of ""Let Go of the Fear"" mutters about ""A cocaine fury/ Mother's little helper."" But more pointedly, lead single ""I Dream of Crystal"" shows how far Chapman has to go as a storyteller-- in the first verse, he's an invested observer of an abusive relationship (""But please don't hurt her, man/ Because I'll hit you as hard as I can/ But that ain't really the plan""), and next he's the defensive addict on the receiving end (""You can't knock what you've never done... so get the fuck off my case""). And then... he repeats, ""You can't change this state of mind,"" for nearly three minutes over a swollen foundation of synths, the lack of resolution coming off more like lazy songwriting than intentional ambiguity.</p>
<p>If anything has carried over from <i>We Can Create</i>, it's Chapman's use of repetition-- the kind you lose your place in, not so much the kind you can get lost in. Over the span of its six minutes, the title track morphs from a hushed salutation to a multitracked maze of harmonies and ringing chords, but it doesn't build so much as blur, its direction preordained. ""Die Happy, Die Smiling"" has a juddering rhythm that shakes you out of the second half's generally slumberous arrangements, but its format is almost identical to the penultimate track from the last album as well-- two dodgy lines repeated over and over again (""It hurts my soul to know you're crying,"" rhymes with the title), but with little else to incur the pulverizing force of ""Don't Fear""'s saturated lead lines and joyous handclaps.</p>
<p>Perhaps unintentionally, <i>Turning the Mind</i> feels chemical itself-- it's a cheap buzz that ultimately should have no problem finding its way into the wheelhouse of people who just can't get enough whooshy sound effects. But as Chapman tries to be therapeutic from the psychologist's couch instead of the mixing board, this shift on <i>Turning</i> puts him behind not just nu-gaze all-stars like M83 and the Big Pink, but also role players like Telefon Tel Aviv and Ulrich Schnauss. Then again, that might not be such a bad thing-- as Axl Rose's actions proved, you never know who's listening to this stuff.</p></div>"|13628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13628-turning-the-mind/|4.8|Ian Cohen

<p>Opener ""Trad""'s title seems apt for the familiar ground it covers: simple, sludgy riffs and a swinging beat-- although the sludge is thicker, the tone more ominous, and the pace a little more trudging than their earlier work. While there's nothing here to disappoint their fans, the band does take some chances. ""Sweet T"" has the group playing in syncopated, palm-muted unison on every note. The tones on ""FFFFF"" are so distorted they sound as if they're breaking apart, while its central riff is a nauseating, teetering two-note circus ride. The song's abrupt outro provides an artful buildup to another left-turn: the simple and satisyfing wall-of-sludge ""Dirty Sun"", a skyscraper-sized anthem that serves as the album's high-water mark.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, ""Tomorrow Midnite"" is a teasing, patient diversion that crawls to its inevitable climax. The dry, far-away tone of its opening minutes carries like the sound of an exhausted metal act coming from the rehearsal space down the hall, building to the singer's barely audible croak of simple, defeatist lyrics. ""Super Moody"" mostly lives up to its name, and its abrupt ending is less of a wry trick than an intentional experiment in dynamics, yet it's a little less fun because of it. ""Starpiss"" isn't the band's first 10-minute-long track, but, unlike B-side ""Hell Is Behind Me"", this one actually builds tension and lets the band finally release some of it in a fast and loose cacophony of snare hits and guitar soloing.</p>
<p>No one's going to mistake Part Chimp for Isis, but getting a little slower and heavier, they've left some of their irreverent charm by the wayside. That charm was part of what made the band  stand apart from its sludge-rock peers, but hearing Part Chimp continue to tweak the formula and expand upon it is still plenty rewarding.</p></div>"|13604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13604-thriller/|7.3|Jason Crock

After all, every artist, no matter how outré, wants people to listen to their records, and ideally as many people as possible. Sure, some make it easier and some make it harder, but no one wants their music to be ignored. Still, those who aspire to make pop music as such presumably value accessibility, and there are any number of tricks-- studio, stylistic, marketing-- one can enlist to pull that off. Yet it's an uphill slog if you don't have the songs to begin with, and on that front the relatively under-the-radar Jack Peñate has a leg up.</p>
<p>This being the 21st century and all, Peñate's brand of pop is predictably broad. He's a soul singer, of sorts, but his voice is closer to a charming yelp than a smooth croon-- more Edwyn Collins or Terry Hall than, say, Jamie Lidell. His music, too, references horn-drenched R&amp;B, but it also broadens its scope to include everything from Afropop to Tropicália. Best of all, it does so naturally, rarely coming off as some cynical or awkward train-jumping exercise. In this way Peñate's second album, <i>Everything Is New</i>, recalls 1980s UK pop at its most blinder-free: dance music that doesn't pander, globetrotting grooves that don't over-reach, songs hardly short on hooks but not smug about them, either.</p>
<p>The title track, with its polyrhythmic percussion, strings, harps, and copious other overdubs, could have gone the overblown route, but as busy as it may be, it's never less than down to earth in its homebrew house party vibe. ""Pull My Heart Away"", ""So Near"", and ""Be the One"" explore different sides of soul, the former slower and more melancholy despite its handclaps and massed backing vocals, the latter two string-laden disco but far from unctuous in their historical references. ""Body Down"" is down-tempo jazzbo rock that makes room for backwards vocals and a noisy space guitar breakdown.</p>
<p>When Peñate does incorporate non-Western elements, he does so minus the usual distracting assembly seams. ""Tonight's Today"" and ""Give Yourself Away"", for example, have as much West African funk in them as London club, but they don't sound like shallow fashion-parade pastiche. And when Peñate gets moody or weird, as he does on ""Every Glance"" and the herky-jerk ""Let's All Die"", respectively, he does so in keeping with the same sense of sophistication and stylistic scope that pervades and informs the rest of the album. It's harder to pull off than it sounds, but no less easy a listen for it. It's wide-eyed pop minus the fizz, demonstrating that sizzle can still be subtle.</p></div>"|13565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13565-everything-is-new/|7.4|Joshua Klein

In it, a 23-year old Julian Casablancas manhandled his mic stand, eyed the camera with a hypnotic mix of rage and anxiety, and tugged at his jacket as if he was about to burst. At one point, Casablancas swatted his mic down and left the stage in a huff only to return <i>exactly</i> as guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. wrapped up a brief solo. Chaos; control. At the end of the song, the singer tripped, completely wiped out in the middle of the stage, and somehow ended up even cooler for it. The ""Letterman"" blitz showed the Strokes at full tilt-- a rock band that set the pace for what a rock band should look, sound, and feel like in a new millennium.</p>
<p>In 2009, a 31-year-old Julian Casablancas played his solo song ""11th Dimension"" with a band that wasn't the Strokes on ""The Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien"". <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/105071/the-tonight-show-with-conan-obrien-tue-oct-27-2009?c=2302"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The performance seems unfair"">The performance just seemed unfair</a>. In it, the singer had no mic stand, eyed the camera as if he were scared and/or lost, and hunched through some of the song like he was trying to hide himself. At one point, he awkwardly pretended to roll some dice. During an atrocious circus-organ solo, Casablancas just idled in the middle of the stage. There was no chance of him falling over because he barely moved.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's unfair to gauge Casablancas against his younger self, but this is a star whose entire currency is based on a youthful brand of Lower East Side punk rebellion that's too cool to actually rebel. Considering the uncertain future of the Strokes-- ""a band is a good way to break up a friendship,"" said Casablancas in a recent interview-- and the fact that the group's last album, 2006's <i>First Impressions of Earth</i>, was something of a shit sandwich, there's more riding on the singer's solo bow than he'd probably like to admit.</p>
<p><i>Phrazes for the Young</i> is a jumble of contradictions. The music and artwork is steeped in 1970s and 1980s tropes yet also vaguely futuristic. The words are apocalyptic, depressing, and sometimes worthy of a zen self-help manual, and while there are only eight songs, this thing seems to go on forever. The ""Conan"" performance was not a momentary blunder-- this album is overstuffed with production do-dads, yet disappointingly devoid of anything coming close to the sort of tossed-off brilliance this guy used to come up with during an afternoon nap.</p>
<p>The title of <i>Phrazes for the Young</i> was based on a series of Oscar Wilde one-liners called <i><a href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Phrases_and_Philosophies_for_the_Use_of_the_Young"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young"">Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young</a></i>. Among the witticisms are gems like, ""Pleasure is the only thing one should live for. Nothing ages like happiness,"" and ""In all unimportant matters, style, not sincerity, is the essential. In all important matters, style, not sincerity, is the essential."" But instead of continuing with Wilde's flighty ""words of wisdom,"" Casablancas takes the ""from on high"" elder statesman attitude but ditches any and all traces of humor. So we get a batch of anti-pleasure, anti-happiness parables that are often too sincere for their own good.</p>
<p>Opener ""Out of the Blue"" has Casablancas reeling off a list of downers-- sadness, bitterness, anger, vengeance-- before settling with premature nostalgia: ""All that I can do is sing a song of faded glory,"" he admits. Meanwhile, ""Left &amp; Right in the Dark"" is even more dire as the singer offers lines like, ""We're in a race against time, and time might be winning,"" before imploring the world at large (or is it himself?) to ""Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!"" Here's another Wilde phrase worth re-reading: ""Dullness is the coming of age of seriousness.""</p>
<p>Produced by Jason Lader (Rilo Kiley, Maroon 5) and Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes), the album is comically slick and bouncy when it's not offering five-minute industrial-synth clusterfucks (""River of Brakelights"") or slow-motion dirges (""Tourist""). Broken free of the stylistic constraints that come with the Strokes, Casablancas makes the classic rookie solo mistake of stuffing his songs with everything in the studio while never stepping back and realizing that a six-minute, country-synth historical lament in honor of Manhattan's Ludlow St. may be a few twangy guitar solos and plodding hooks too much.</p>
<p>The record fares best when channeling Cyndi Lauper or the Eurythmics while keeping the tempo close to jumpy. Offstage, ""11th Dimension"" pumps along with endearing silliness, even if Casablancas claims he's stuck ""on the frozen surface of a fireball"" on the track. And the gorgeous electro ballad ""Glass"" finds something lovely amidst a world sadly insulated by bulletproof windows.</p>
<p>The irony is that <i>Phrazes for the Young</i> is so smoothed over-- nearly all of Casablancas' trademark vocal roughness is airbrushed into oblivion-- it instantly sounds like a plexiglass-covered museum piece. At their best, the Strokes had no trouble adding spontaneity to their meticulously arranged pop-rock songs. <i>Phrazes </i>leaves no room for such spur-of-the-moments. And, when coupled with Casablancas' often-suffocating, old-timer sentiments, the record allows itself only brief glimmers of life.

The tune, the seventh track on the shuffly garage-rockers' third LP together, is a disarmer no matter your take on it; without ruining the surprise, the tastebuds in question are attached all over the nether quarters, allowing for some heretofore unknown pleasures. It's not half as funny as Khan and Sultan think it is, but it is precisely as catchy as they think it is. If their goal was to get me to walk around my apartment describing the new sensations in my bathing-suit area, well, mission accomplished, gents.</p>
<p>Both Khan and Sultan are as good as anybody at brushing 40-odd years of dust off old <i>Nuggets</i> tropes; since their last meeting on wax, 2006's <i>What's For Dinner?</i>, Khan and his Shrines and Sultan by his lonesome have each crafted one heck of a snarling platter of 1960s-indebted rock'n'roll. But there was also the recent debacle from the Almighty Defenders, an ""evil gospel"" supergroup featuring Khan, Sultan, and the Black Lips that boasted of its quick conception while failing to address how slapdash the end product felt. It's easy to see why they were confident in pulling that off: Khan's a stupendously stylish vocalist, able to ape everybody from the Big Bopper to Otis Redding without losing a move, and Sultan's got some ear for compact arrangements and clever melodic interjections. There's a swagger here borne out of totally earned confidence; these dudes are good, and they know it. But confidence can take on ugly forms from time to time, and it does get a little grisly on <i>Invisible Girl</i>; sometimes you feel like these guys were just a bit too cocky in their abilities to finish writing the damn song.</p>
<p>It's easy to become taken in by opener ""Anala"", what with Khan's ooh-mow-mows and Sultan's surprisingly sweet croon. The somewhat curious but nevertheless successful title track comes next; eschewing the chug'n'thwomp for which they're both noted in favor of a straightahead shimmer that suggests both the Byrds and the La's, it's a lovingly crafted tune and perhaps a hint at a new direction, only slightly out of step with the other material here. From there, it's throwback time, as Khan and Sultan navigate the divide between Little Anthony and the Seeds. Throughout, it's Sultan's voice that stands out-- particularly on the slow-burning, ""Still of the Night""-like ""Third Ave.""-- among everything, sweet and shape-shifting next to Khan's gruntier style. The Sultan-led tunes tend to be less aggressive than Khan's, which is odd; not for Sultan, who handles himself admirably as a singer and player throughout <i>Invisible Girl</i>, but for Khan, whose does best when he's got a little more space to work with. Among the sharp shocks of ""Truth or Dare"" or ""Lonely Boy"", he sounds perfunctory, rushed.</p>
<p>Something you might say about even the best stuff on Invisible Girl. Khan and Sultan move between the trappings of doo-wop to skid rock so fitfully it's easy to miss that some of these tunes aren't all there lyrically. Once the guffaws stop, it can get a little predictable. Songs like ""Spin the Bottle"" and ""I'll Be Loving You"" are indebted to a period in music that was by and large not its most fertile poetically, but for all their musical formalism, they're obviously irreverent cats-- remember ""Tastebuds""? It's just too bad, for every ""Animal Party"" or ill-fated game of ""Spin the Bottle"" and well-placed anatomical joke there's one too many tunes that just go through the motions, and old ones at that. Still, the tunes on <i>Invisible Girl</i> work, because Khan and Sultan's love of the music they're ripping off is obvious and infectious, and because they've got a knack for capturing the feel of the records they're taking cues from most throwbacks can't quite muster. Sam the Sham would be proud; that is, if he's cool with dick jokes.</p></div>"|13484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13484-invisible-girl/|7.1|Paul Thompson

It was an easy plotline: The man who helped popularize and expand minimal-- a seminal contributor, as one half of Closer Musik, to Kompakt's early discography, and author of 2005's still-underheard <i>Are You Really Lost</i>-- would, with <i>Ay Ay Ay</i>, re-order our expectations for minimal's future. <i>Ay Ay Ay</i> explodes that meme, however, with an album so far removed from Aguayo's past-- it's a record of maximal, fermented oddity-- that it borders on the bizarre.</p>
<p><i>Ay Ay Ay</i> is an album composed mostly of the human voice, continuing Aguayo's penchant for silly/sexy singspeak but filling out the rest of the compositions with throaty squelches, triple-tracked a cappella nonsense, and sampled chants. More than simply ""that techno guy who sings,"" Aguayo seems to have developed a childlike fascination with the human voice on par with Timbaland, Rahzel, or (frequent collaborator) DJ Koze. Because of its sparse percussion, preponderance of voices-- chatting, yelling, singing-- and Chilean-born Aguayo's tendency to sing in Spanish, <i>Ay Ay Ay</i> often feels like world music, though less in a 1980s-Borders-Books-and-Music-endcap sense and more because it sounds well-traveled and totally foreign.</p>
<p>Foreign as in unfamiliar: <i>Ay Ay Ay</i> sounds like no other album this year, and it's no stretch to say it's one of the most out-of-character releases ever for Kompakt. Any discussion of musical influence almost seems superfluous, however, as Aguayo spends much of <i>Ay Ay Ay</i> proving his credentials as an inspired goofball. Lead track ""Menta Latte"", which barrels out of the gate with whumping bass voices, sounds like a group of skilled six year-olds putting Saturday morning to song. ""Koro Koro"" is Soweto-style pop undercut by compressed, clacking beats. The title track is stepping tropic pop. The clingy ""Rollerskate"" is disarmingly coherent in its form and presumed function: it sounds like rollerskating.</p>
<p>""Rollerskate"" is easily the most parse-able jam; I don't speak Spanish, but Aguayo's history indicates that the rest of the lyrics are husky shit-talk and/or crappy come-ons. It's hard to wonder what else would fit into the hum-hum-grind of ""Desde Rusia"" or the Talking-Heads-on-E of ""Ritmo Tres"".</p>
<p>If Aguayo's electronic background rears its head, it does so abstractly, as long stretches of the hour-long <i>Ay Ay Ay</i> can dissolve into prattling sound-soups, the clicks and thumps of the producer's previous work replaced with tongue-snaps and party favor whoops (""Mucho Viento""). Despite the expectations for the record, <i>Ay Ay Ay</i> doesn't redraw the lines of minimal electronic music. Naturally, it's not trying to. It does reroute our conception of Aguayo, however. <i>Ay Ay Ay</i> is a sticky-sweet, unbounded mess, but only the priggish and unimaginative will hold that against it.</p></div>"|13664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13664-ay-ay-ay/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

After all, collaborators and live-show bandmates notwithstanding, Sleeping States <i>is</i> Markland Starkie.  The ""group"" began as a self-sufficient one-man operation back in 2004, though enough people eventually got hip to Starkie's potent and heady lo-fi brew that he didn't need to continue self-releasing his music.  It doesn't hurt that some of these folks have impeccable pedigrees-- members of Grizzly Bear and the Klaxons have given Sleeping States some free press, and the label that currently pays Starkie, Bella Union, is run by former Cocteau Twin Simon Raymonde.  <i>Gardens</i> is actually Sleeping States' second Bella Union release-- the first was an EP, <i>Old vs. New</i>, wherein Starkie re-recorded some of his older tunes.  Even at only five songs, its stylistic careening between gussied-up punkish fervor and soothing indie-rockery showed Starkie to be as restless and precocious as he is talented, and served as an appropriate portrait of what Sleeping States were at that point.</p>
<p>But one listen to ""Rings of Saturn"", the first track off <i>Gardens</i>, and the notion of Sleeping States as the brainchild of a pastoral yet hyper-caffeinated lo-fi mad scientist quickly falls away.  Starkie sings in a breathless lilting croon, a voice that might remind some of a less bombastic Rufus Wainwright.  Most of the song is just Starkie gracefully navigating a halting and beguiling melody as a bass guitar is steadily strummed.  The words he sings are equally beguiling, offering haunting images of ""bones of lost towns"" and ""the coast at your cheek,"" which lend the song a nostalgic and melancholy air.  The circular guitar figure that enters after a minute of this adds to the mood.  But this gentle setting is gradually intruded upon-- first by a queasy bed of feedback, then (courtesy of Rose Clark, Starkie's only collaborator on <i>Gardens</i>) rolling, crashing drums.  These interlopers slowly emerge from the background of the song like shadowy figures walking out of a thick fog.  Soon Starkie stops singing, and lets the intruders have their way.  While all this is going on, however, the bass remains steadfast, weathering this ever-growing storm, playing the same sequence of notes it's played since the track began.  As the noise slowly relents, Starkie's voice returns, offering more fragmented phrases that ache with an unspecified longing-- ""every day, so many times, we never see you anymore,"" ""this is what you let us see,"" ""impressions of the morning sun""-- until the song reaches a resigned conclusion. ""Rings of Saturn"" covers a lot of  ground in its five minutes, ground that Starkie's previous work merely hinted at in passing, if ever.  If this track was meant to introduce listeners to a more mature and self-assured Sleeping States, then they made one hell of a first impression.</p>
<p><i>Gardens</i> finds Starkie ably synthesizing lessons learned from his DIY home-taping years into fully-realized songs of all shapes and sizes.  It's to his credit as a songwriter that the weakest tracks on <i>Gardens</i> are a) the most ordinary and b) weak only in comparison to their surroundings.  Perfectly fine tunes like ""Red King"" or ""The Cartographer"" might be highlights on someone else's record, but they pale in comparison to the magic Starkie works throughout the rest of the album.  When he cuts away from the pensive tension he's been building in ""Showers in Summer"" to let the song briefly pause and breathe, switching from tight snare rolls and expectant guitar plucking to gentle rushes of cymbal and guitar picking, it's like the sun briefly breaking through the clouds as the rain relents. ""Breathing Space"" is that moment of pause and reflection extended, Starkie filling the space with casual strums of guitar, the ambient noise of a lazy city street, and his enviable voice multi-tracked behind him, posing as an acrobatic angelic chorus.  His voice being his best instrument, Starkie wisely employs it as much as he can, and often to fantastic effect.  Nowhere is this more apparent than on the pseudo-title track, ""Gardens of the South"".  In some ways, the track's sparseness mirrors that of ""Rings of Saturn"", except that in this case it's the drums providing the song's steady rhythm as multiple Starkies sweetly swoon and dive  around the narrator's unabashed and unapologetic desire-- ""When you ask if I've been saying too much/ I reply, 'I can tell by your eyes and your hands/ That you haven't said enough.'""</p>
<p>If there's anything negative to say about <i>Gardens</i>, it's that it doesn't lend itself to casual listening.  These restless and nearly immaculate tales of love and longing, when taken in as a whole, might blend together to form a tastefully indistinct blur. That was never an issue in Sleeping States' past, when an album would change gears without either hesitation or purpose.  The closest this album comes to offering that sort of pace-change is with the ever-so-brief guitar squeal that opens ""On the Beach at Aldeburgh"".  But exchanging that sort of free-and-easy inconsistency for a steadier and more stately hand, if it leads to works like this, is a trade-off worth making at every opportunity.  The restless spirit that fueled Markland Starkie's previous work is still present.  It's just being expressed in a way that demands your attention instead of distracting it.  And the attention that <i>In the Gardens of the North</i> demands, it rewards tenfold.</p></div>"|13539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13539-in-the-gardens-of-the-north/|8.0|David Raposa

Bondy realizes that acknowledging his tenure as Verbena frontman Scott Bondy could help shift a few units, that doesn't mean his former life is a point of pride. This is how a writer describes Bondy's indie-rock days in the singer/songwriter's Fat Possum bio: ""He told me that he used to go by the name Scott and had played in a Rock'n'Roll group went by the name Verbena. I asked him what that was like and he muttered something about being an infant in a crib full of bats."" Still, for A.A. Bondy to now exist, Scott Bondy had to go through that ill-fated bat-crib phase. And despite the sonic differences and the name change-- the A.A. stands for Auguste Arthur-- there's an obvious through-line to be drawn between then and now. Where the old Bondy took his cues from all sorts of rock'n'roll progenitors (classic and otherwise), the new Bondy cribs notes from the blues and country folks that influenced those rock'n'rollers. And where the old Bondy would sometimes show his hand too blatantly, the new Bondy is playing his cards with greater aplomb and much greater skill. <i>When the Devil's Loose</i>, A.A. Bondy's second album, is evident of this ever-growing skill. But that's not to say there isn't room to grow.</p>
<p>In many ways, <i>When's the Devil's Loose</i> is nearly the same as 2007's <i>American Hearts</i>. Bondy's warm and weathered moan is used to good effect, abetted by some down-home instrumentation and a fair helping of flattering reverb, all in the service of songs that do their damnedest to recall a more agrarian time-- coal burning in a train furnace, rivers running free, pines dancing in the moonlight. <i>Loose</i> puts its best foot forward right from the start, with ""Mightiest of Guns"". If any tune on this album deserves to be called ""Dylanesque"" (possibly the most unbearably portentous modifier/ honorarium thrown in Bondy's direction), it's this one, with its plainspoken torrent of elusive yet evocative images-- ""And the shadows go like ghosts across your rope/ Or take the world and burn it in a spoon."" Each verse offers its own portrait of quotidian drama enlivened by Bondy's wracked croon and tasteful strokes of arcing guitar. The rest of the album offers downtrodden pleasures in a similar vein-- see the elegiac ""To the Morning"", or the player-piano balladry of ""On the Moon"". Even when Bondy's band kicks up its heels, as on the relatively ebullient ""I Can See the Pines Are Dancing"", it's doing so through a weary hard-livin' haze. Still, the music never suffers for the song's overall sorrow. Where <i>Loose</i> does suffer, if only slightly, is in its words.</p>
<p>Think back on the image of an infant trapped in a crib full of bats-- it's definitely colorful, and reads off-the-cuff, but there's something a little <i>off</i> about it, like it's trying too hard to be colorful and off-the-cuff. The bio's first line, an introduction that could be framed as a not-so-sly jab at folks like yours truly, suggests it's the singer/songwriter himself is sitting at the typewriter: ""I don't know much about music, so I guess that makes me an expert."" Regardless, it's the sense of desperately trying to sell one's self as authentic, rather than simply acting the part, that undercuts what <i>Loose</i> does so well.</p>
<p>More often than not, the music and the mood can make any potential lyrical faux pas a non-issue-- ""A Slow Parade"" and the title track falls into pat fire/desire rhyme patterns, but Bondy's voice smooths over those rough edges and sells the tunes' worry and desperation like a carny selling tickets to the egress. And while Bondy's awkward deployment of colloquialisms like ""a-callin'"" and ""a-cryin'"" in ""Oh the Vampyre"" almost steers the tune into <i>True Blood</i> fanfic territory, the succinctness of a line like, ""You know I could drink the world/ And never get my fill,"" rings as true as anything. But talk of ""a Mississippi night"" (on ""The Mercy Wheel"") or ""the cars of silver and gold"" (on ""The Coal Hits the Fire"") comes off like all-hat no-cattle flourishes from someone trying to pull a fast one. They're placeholder phrases that a more experienced and exacting writer would backtrack and replace, yet Bondy uses them to embellish, if not illuminate, his songs. That Bondy shows a fair amount of evidence on <i>Loose</i> of being the sort of exacting writer that could effortlessly avoid these pitfalls makes such missteps all the more disappointing. And that Bondy can still conjure up a collection of evocative and intriguing songs that succeeds despite this only augurs well for his future.</p></div>"|13509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13509-when-the-devils-loose/|6.6|David Raposa

Among the syndromes those experts may decide whether to include in the latest edition is Peter Pan Syndrome, adults who long for youth so powerfully they begin to act like eternal children. Think Michael Jackson, who in naming his ranch Neverland, certainly invited the diagnosis.</p>
<p>But most people with Peter Pan Syndrome regress to pre-pubertal life, an age before the complications of responsibility and sexuality. So what do we call what Rivers Cuomo has? The Weezer frontman seems to be stuck in an eternal puberty, forever 13-- confused, horny, hyperbolic, obsessed with brand names. It's a characteristic that has always been at the heart of Weezer, from ""In the Garage"" onward. But it's never been more concentrated than on <i>Raditude</i>, which, from its goofy name and cover art to its Mountain Dew-jacked sound and melodramatic lyrics, is designed to hit 13-year-old boys directly on target.</p>
<p>And Cuomo is damned good at getting inside the frightening mind of a teenage boy. ""(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To"" is a perfect title for a song about awkward courtship, and the fact that the narrator takes his date to Best Buy (teenage Mecca) before a home viewing of <i>Titanic</i> is pinpoint detail. Echoes of ""In the Garage"" turn up in, well, ""In the Mall"", written by drummer Patrick Wilson but sold by Cuomo emphatically chronicling the cruising circuit of elevator-to-escalator-to-elevator. Elsewhere on <i>Raditude</i>, Cuomo whines about going to work, pressures girls into third base, parrots hip-hop slang, escapes into ridiculous fantasy, and on bonus track ""Get Me Some"" portrays the teenage experience in four words: ""Right now/ Everything sucks.""</p>
<p>Of course, these journal scrawls are backed largely by power-pop-- what else could it be? Cuomo proved for all time with the first two Weezer records (and fleetingly since) that he's a master of the genre, popping out melodic sing-alongs and fuzz-guitar riffs, and <i>Raditude</i> largely goes back to those basics. ""Let It All Hang Out"" is a song about celebrating the weekend and forgetting your troubles and sounds like the song you would play to do exactly that. The peppy (if a bit on the creepy side) ""I'm Your Daddy"", made with Britney and Miley collaborator Dr. Luke, justly turns the table on rock-borrowing pop like ""Since U Been Gone"". All together, it sounds like the first record ever written with the goal expressly in mind of being kick-ass to play on <i>Rock Band</i>. The departures from that formula are harder to stomach, particularly the Bollywood-drenched Hallmark card ""Love Is the Answer"", which is absolutely awful.</p>
<p>I still get hate mail for saying <i>Make Believe</i> was so bad that it retroactively ruined the Blue Album and <i>Pinkerton</i>, and I still believe it-- ""Beverly Hills"" was the sound of a band that had learned to do as little as possible to write a hit. But <i>Raditude</i> doesn't have that stench of minimal calculation on it; if anything, it's as earnest as the famously confessional <i>Pinkerton</i>, just written by someone whose age doesn't match his POV. But the record's teen-boy empowerment message doesn't have much to offer anyone over 13 years old. Perhaps the proper fictional character to reference isn't Peter Pan, but Matthew McConaughey's Wooderson from <i>Dazed and Confused</i>-- we all get older, Rivers Cuomo stays the same age.</p></div>"|13656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13656-raditude/|4.5|Rob Mitchum

Neither hilly nor flat, verdant nor desert, this section of I-40 feels like a time trap: You can drive for what seems like hours through the blank fields and past service stations that dot the roadside, but once you look at the clock, you'll find that only a few minutes have passed. On their first collaboration together, Jason Molina and Will Johnson have made the musical equivalent of that length of Arkansas highway. The 14 tracks on <i>Molina and Johnson</i> comprise an especially slow drive through somber countryside, windows up and speed limit carefully maintained.</p>
<p>It's especially disappointing from these two prolific indie lifers, who have painted such distinctive American landscapes throughout their careers. An underrated singer and decoder-ring-demanding lyricist, Johnson oversees a range of projects, from the relatively pop-motivated Centro-Matic to the dustily atmospheric South San Gabriel, each playing off hardscrabble Lone Star rock to create something unique and accessible. Molina, on the other hand, has grown only more direct in his songs, abandoning the avant-Americana outfit Songs: Ohia for the more straightforward classic rock of Magnolia Electric Co., which tends to work best in big, broad landscapes (the box set ­<i>Sojourner</i>) rather than in life-size portraiture (<i>Josephine</i>, from earlier this year).</p>
<p>The duo wrote and recorded <i>Molina and Johnson</i> during a 10-day respite in Johnson's home base of Denton, Texas, where they drank, smoked, and reportedly shot BB guns. Rather than showcasing any of that genial amity, the result is a sleepy, soundtracky, unexcitable record. Slow and subdued are legitimate musical choices, but an album of such low-key songs, especially from a pair of musicians who have displayed a broader palette in the past, seems like a missed opportunity, as if each is narrowing instead of expanding the possibilities for the other. Especially in its middle third, <i>Molina and Johnson</i> lags sluggishly, packing in too many gravely austere and relentlessly funereal numbers, like Johnson's slow-moving ""In the Avalon/The Killer"" and Molina's studiously stark ""Each Star Marks a Day"". There are hints of intriguing contrast on songs on the album-- Johnson's gritty rasp, wandering piano, and earthy imagery versus Molina's airy tenor, sparking guitar licks, and celestial navigations-- but they're never explored or examined in any interesting way.</p>
<p>There are a few bright spots on this otherwise monochromatic album, most crammed toward the beginning. With its shuffling percussion and mournful guitar, opener ""Twenty Cycles to the Ground"" delivers a hook forged from hard syllables and mixes their voices evocatively. The hummed ""Now, Divide"" sounds like Dylan's <i>Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid </i>soundtrack played at the wrong speed, and ""All Gone, All Gone"" is positively Oldham-esque as a hitchhiking Sarah Jaffe shows up to wrap her voice around Johnson's. But these moments never coalesce into anything larger or more sustained, nor do they make the scenery all that intriguing, which is a shame considering the wanderlust of their previous projects. They have always been curious to see what's around the next bend or over the next hill, but <i>Molina and Johnson</i> too often sounds like it can barely make it up the incline to enjoy the view.</p></div>"|13659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13659-molina-and-johnson/|5.1|Stephen M.

Pants Yell! have named their fifth album after, basically, the Queen's accent. If the title of last year's <i>Alison Statton</i> placed the Boston trio in the less-is-more lineage of Young Marble Giants, then <i>Received Pronunciation</i> acknowledges what they still more or less are: indie pop formalists, mastering a given dialect rather than inventing unknown tongues. The band's latest does away with the horns and strings of its predecessor, following a bit more conservatively in the tradition of wordy, tuneful, earnest underdogs from Small Factory and the Trashcan Sinatras to the Lucksmiths.</p>
<p>What <i>Received Pronunciation</i> loses in variety-- my kingdom for another ""Two French Sisters""!-- it largely makes up for with increasingly accomplished songcraft. Since when has subtlety been supposed to call attention to itself, anyway? You're probably not going to like <i>Received Pronunciation</i> unless you occasionally enjoy breezy, midtempo songs with jangling/shimmering (choose one) rhythm guitar, slinky lead guitar lines, bustling drum fills, warm bass, and shy vocals, but the appeal of Pants Yell! is less about a particular sound than about lyrics and melodies. It also probably helps if you tend to appreciate understated storytelling and unexpected rhymes, though a line like, ""I remember your white sunglasses/ And the way the sun just went right past us,"" is a little more Billy Bragg than Upper West Side soweto.</p>
<p><i>Received Pronunciation</i> won't close you out like new slang; Pants Yell! would rather you make yourself at home, look around the place. First single ""Cold Hands"" sounds more inviting on each listen, with its ""First of the Gang to Die"" bounce, relationship anxiety, and wordplay that works without coming across like its singer needs a pat on the head. Parisian postcard ""Rue de la Paix"" luxuriates in detail, as singer Andrew Churchman declares, ""I remember every little thing."" But the songs more often show only what's needed: It's up to the listener to puzzle out the hungover unease of measured opener ""Frank and Sandy""; ""Not Wrong"", in which the narrator admits he can't tie a tie, has to be one of the most peaceful songs ever about getting into a fight. Underneath the polite surfaces is seething coming-of-age pathos: ""Does that asshole ever tell you that he still thinks of Megan?"" Churchman demands on ""Got to Stop"". The biggest misstep is ""Spider"", a 50-second bit of sympathy for the arachnid in winter. You can be <i>too </i>understated.</p>
<p>""What's the point of all this living?"" Churchman sings on accusatory finale ""To Take"", adding, ""Living's all I ever do."" He has told Swedish magazine <i>Devotion</i> that <i>Received Pronunciation</i> will be the final Pants Yell! album. They want to go the way of Huggy Bear and Felt rather than grow old and predictable. Too bad, because <i>Received Pronunciation</i> isn't my favorite Pants Yell! album, nor the most varied. If a recent <i>Guardian</i> column by critic Simon Reynolds is right, though, and what makes the Beatles, Motown, and great synthpop all immortal is not necessarily revolution, but ""melody and emotion,"" then Pants Yell! definitely have the ingredients to last forever-- if only for a faithful few who speak their language.</p></div>"|13605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13605-received-pronunciation/|7.3|Marc Hogan

If North Carolina (via New Jersey) drunk-rockers Spider Bags ever want to sell bumper stickers at their merch table, let this line-- taken from the teary, beery ballad ""Lord Please""-- be the slogan. It's a lyric that perfectly sums up the band's place in a venerable tradition of country-rock hurtin' songs and their singular status within it.</p>
<p>Sure, you've heard bands like Spider Bags before; on first contact, you'd swear they were some half-remembered mid-1990s band that got lost in the college-radio shuffle among the Silver Jews, the Grifters, and Ass Ponys. But it's been an awful long time since you've heard a band pull off this sort of southern-fried slop-pop with such charm, craftiness, and self-deprecating wit. On their second album, <i>Goodbye Cruel World, Hello Crueler World</i>, Spider Bags re-imagine Neil Young's <i>Tonight's the Night </i>as a Saturday-night party album: They're bleary eyed and wobbly kneed, but they're going down on swinging (or, at least, swigging).</p>
<p>Spider Bags' ragged but resilient spirit has made them heroes to Titus Andronicus, who have covered the Bags' signature song ""Waking Up Drunk"", though Bags don't share their New Jersey successors' penchant for burn-it-down drama. But the songs on <i>Goodbye Cruel World</i> twist and turn more than you'd expect from a country-rock album, riffing on standard verse-chorus-verse templates before introducing an even more rewarding, final-act change-up, whether it's the poignant pedal-steeled finale to the front-porch picker ""Swimmer on a String"" or the giddy stream of ""na na na na na""s appended to the early-Replacements trash-pop of ""Dishrag"". Even the typical juke-joint rave-up ""Long White Desert Rose"" upends the formula, revealing its chorus only during a sustained build-up in the final 90 seconds, and sending it aloft on a bed of ""ooh ooh ooh"" backing harmonies.</p>
<p>Though Spider Bags have just two albums and a handful of 7""s to the their name so far, the band's MySpace bio is quick to point out that its members have been playing in bands for 15 years, and <i>Cruel World</i>'s best songs ruminate on their refusal to grow up, albeit with a wisdom and clarity that you acquire only in your mid-30s: on the corroded jangle-pop of ""Hey Delinquents"", frontman Dan McGee plays an advisory big-brother role to a younger generation of misfits, while ""Que Viva El Rocanroll"" is a sloshed, shoulder-to-shoulder last-call waltz for those who really should know better than to stay out past 3 a.m. on a weeknight. And then there's the seven-minute colossus ""Trouble"", on which McGee owns up to a lifetime of deviancy before his mantric chorus line yields to a surprisingly nasty bout of wah-wah-pedal abuse. If there's a problem with <i>Cruel World</i>, it's that it never regains its proper footing after this monster jam; for an album that routinely inspires a certain raised-fist perseverance, the somber, Califoned pastorale ""Here Now"" is a bit of a bummer note to go out on. Sure, that album title sets you up for life's great letdowns, but Spider Bags' greatest attribute is making you believe you can rise above them.</p></div>"|13650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13650-goodbye-cruel-world-hello-crueler-world/|7.6|Stuart Berman

That's not to say their schtick isn't schtick or that it doesn't constantly threaten to expire on every song. Even Presley, perhaps the least introspective rock musician ever, evolved and developed from 1956 to 77. Meanwhile, Spencer still whoops it up like he did a quarter-century ago.</p>
<p>That's why Verta-Ray makes such a good foil for him-- even more dynamic than the Dickinson brothers or even the Sadies. The former Madder Rose bass player and Blues Explosion touring member either draws out more nuance from Spencer or allows Spencer to draw it out himself, but without watering down his delivery. That makes Heavy Trash his most successful project this decade, or at least the one that most inventively restages his schtick. Compared to Spencer Dickinson or even JSBX, the range of styles and sounds on <i>Midnight Soul Serenade­ </i>is anarchic, full of goofing-around (but never winking) allusions to Sun Studio, Louisiana Hayride, Muscle Shoals, and juvenile delinquent films, as well as more than a few side glances toward contemporaries like the Flat Duo Jets, the White Stripes, and, ahem, Southern Culture on the Skids. Out of the gate, ""Gee, I Really Love You"" cribs off the Dixie Cups' cheat sheet, turning their ""Chapel of Love"" into a lascivious wedding-night come-on. On ""Good Man"", the duo hire the chain gang from either Sam Cooke's ""Chain Gang"" or Tennessee Ernie Ford's ""Sixteeen Tons"", as if to let you know how effortless it is. On the other hand, proximity to Link Wray (the stalled ""Pimento"" and the rattletrap ""Sweet Little Bird"") just shows how hard they have to work.</p>
<p>What saves Heavy Trash in general and <i>Midnight Soul Serenade­ </i>in particular is their unironic jocularity. For them, rock is supposed to be fun and freeing, and critical handwringing over Spencer's intentions toward rock seems to miss the point of his fairly straightforward goofball approach. Even if his music is something to ""get"" rather than to just blindly enjoy, the duo's approach here means they rarely get too caught up in provenance. Sure, there are dead ends here, such as the hallucinogenic story-song ""The Pill"" and the hokily ramblin' closer ""In My Heart"", but ""Bumble Bee"" is a fever-dream cartoon that's funnier than the old <i>SNL</i> skit, and ""(Sometimes You Got to Be) Gentle"" hurls increasingly randy single entendres over tremulously dissembling guitar riffs. In fact, name aside, Heavy Trash never get too heavy on<i> Midnight Soul Serenade.</i> It might be Spencer's lightest and breeziest album to date, a testimony to his stick-to-it-iveness despite the advancing years and changing trends.</p></div>"|13652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13652-midnight-soul-serenade/|7.0|Stephen M.

<p>It's not as though he can comfortably retire  to civilian life. David Thomson  once wrote of how fame had condemned an elderly woman to live out  her  days ""sequestered in the cathedral called Greta Garbo."" By contrast,  the young Steven Patrick eagerly triple-locked the door and then tossed  away the key upon entering the gothic mansion called Morrissey. But,  self-condemned to the stage, are his fifties to be an ever decreasing circuit  of provincial theaters, hawking threadbare B-sides? I'm not cynical  enough to suggest that the fall was psychosomatically stage-managed,  but you can see how the suggestion of a final savage spotlit exit might  spice up the prospect of a Saturday night in Swindon.</p>
<p>I suppose the elegant option would  be to retreat to some Tuscan villa or Parisian hotel, like Dirk Bogarde  or Louise Brooks, and compose his perfectly poisonous memoirs. Or   he could fade to gray in Vegas residency, crooning guttering torch songs  to senile old Smiths fans. He could even return triumphant to his homeland  which is eager at last to embrace him as an iconic, harmless old English  eccentric, become a chatshow fixture, and accept a knighthood.</p>
<p>In the MGM  biopic that he has always  been reshooting in his head, the Swindon swoon makes a much better opening  scene for the closing chapter of <i>The Morrissey Story</i>.  Of course, he   has  been announcing the murderous urgency of life since he was a boy, but  the best tracks on <i>Swords</i> seem designed to provide the perfectly piquant  soundtrack. ""The Never-Played Symphonies"", perversely tucked away  originally on second CD and 12"" of ""Irish Blood, English Heart"",  when it's finer than several recent singles, finds our hero reflecting  from his death bed.  Consumed by regret,  sighing over a stuttering  player piano, he doesn't see the  glory, wealth, or adulation, only  the never-laid and the never-played: those errant hearts and songs  never now to be captured.</p>
<p>Similarly, ""Christian Dior"" addresses  a fellow ""lionized maverick,"" and sympathizes with a life hemmed-in  by style. Musically the song is another humdrum  strummed waltz, but  the image of what might have been stirs him  to heights of falsetto, hysterically overcompensating for the lack of  drama in the tune. ""Sweetie-Pie"", a rare co-writing  credit for keyboard  player Mikey Farrell, is more satisfying.  Morrissey's voice is tossed and submerged  amid a vortex of effects, as he delivers a fierce last plea for deliverance,  before disappearing beneath the waves. [<i>Correction: Morrissey's voice was not pitchshifted on the track, as was originally stated-- the second vocal on the track belongs to singer Kristeen Young-- Ed.</i>]</p>
<p>But elsewhere the music offers the  singer too little to work with.  On ""Good Looking Man About Town""  Alain Whyte  tries to spice things up with hints of raga, but unfortunately  brings to mind  Kula Shaker. ""Ganglord"" is the latest doomed  attempt to repeat the dense swampy drone of ""How Soon Is Now?"".  Lyrically, Morrissey casts around for subjects other than himself, without  much success: both ""Teenage Dad on His Estate"" and (the iTunes-only) ""Slum Mums"" would like to report  back fearlessly from the frontline of the  modern underclass, but feel peculiarly dated, right down to the reference  to the ""Jensen Interceptor"" as someone's runaround.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, asked what it exactly  it was he does, Morrissey would reply ""Well, I'm not bad with words."" For a long time now, he's been a great pop star first, a great singer  second, and a lyric writer somewhere around fourth or fifth. In the  past of course, this needn't have been a problem. In his 50th year, Frank Sinatra  could call upon songs of the quality of ""It  Was a Very Good Year"".  Morrissey naturally takes the precisely opposite  tack, but without Brill Building  industry to fall back on, he increasingly  resorts to covering the heroes of his youth: David Bowie (a stilted live take  on ""Drive-In Saturday"") and the New York Dolls (the iTunes-only ""Human Being"").</p>
<p>In the absence of a compelling   partner, Morrissey must rely on his audience to bring him to life. Initial  quantities of <i>Swords</i> come  bundled with a bonus disc of songs recorded  live in Warsaw, and what's striking is how even second division songs  like ""I Just Want to See the Boy Happy"" or ""Black Cloud"" seem  turbo-charged with intensity when performed live, how as a singer he  is able to simultaneously celebrate, interrogate, and mock his own back  catalogue,  while basking in the spotlight and the crowd's devotion.</p>
<p>""It is the terrifying power of the true pop artist,"" Morrissey once wrote, in the sleevenotes to a compilation celebrating Klaus Nomi, Nico, Johnny Thunders, and Marc Bolan, ""who seems to finally come into full bloom only at the hour of Death (as if Life is just not quite the point)?"" And though there's often been something  touchingly hypochondriac about a drug-free, vegetarian millionaire  insisting  at 50 that the hour of his death is imminent,   the  melodramatic possibility has now been raised that every show  ever after might be his last, and that, like the nightingale in  that Oscar Wilde fairytale, his song will grow ever sweeter as he approaches  his doom.</p></div>"|13651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13651-swords/|5.0|Stephen Troussé

This story has been repeated so many times that it's rare to find Cobain's music framed in any other context, especially since his suicide served only to make him a rock'n'roll martyr. Foo Fighters have something of a hero myth going on too, but it's a lot less dramatic: Following the death of his comrade, Dave Grohl rocked on as the leader of his own band, and spent the next 15 years making mainstream rock radio, uh, slightly more listenable.</p>
<p>Grohl's task may not be anywhere near as glamorous or as era-defining as that of his former band, but in a way, it's much more difficult and thankless. In the years after Cobain's death, corporate consolidation of rock radio took hold and quickly snuffed out nearly every bit of underground weirdness that made its way into the mainstream after the record industry went through its phase of signing every cult band they could get in the hopes of finding another Nirvana. The playlists got tighter, and if you're reading this site, we probably don't need to tell you just how bad the music on these stations got, and how to this day it only seems to get worse. Grohl and his band may have been grandfathered into the radio format mainly for his connection to Nirvana, but he earned his keep and turned out a reliable string of enjoyable hits.</p>
<p>This probably sounds like faint praise. Indeed, you barely need to be mediocre to outshine the likes of Nickelback, Creed, and Hoobastank, but Foo Fighters are not merely a tolerable band floating along in a sea of crap, or a decent band that somehow remains mainstream against the odds. Foo Fighters are excellent at being mainstream, and, over the course of six albums, Dave Grohl has gone through the unlikely transformation of being known only as the powerhouse drummer of Nirvana to becoming his generation's answer to Tom Petty-- a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock.</p>
<p>Part of what makes Foo Fighters thrilling, at least from an indie/alt-rock perspective, is that Grohl manages to smuggle bits of underground sounds into his arena-filling hits. ""All My Life"", a smash from 2002's <i>One By One</i>, owes a significant debt to the slashing chord progressions of math rock titans Chavez, and ""Big Me"" is one of the few songs to come out of twee to enjoy major commercial success in the United States. ""Everlong"", perhaps Grohl's most enduring and beloved composition, bridges the gap between the midwestern post-hardcore emo of Hum and Braid and the more commercial iterations of emo that would follow.</p>
<p>Grohl doesn't appropriate in order to seem hip, and his reference points are not particularly relevant to getting across the appeal of his music-- he simply has good taste and borrows ideas that work. His soaring ballads, like ""Learn to Fly"" and ""Times Like These"", are not nearly as cool, but his punk influences shine through in his total commitment to a sentimental tone without allowing for mawkishness or surrendering to cheesiness. Grohl is known to be a funny guy, but there is never a trace of an ironic smirk in the guy's music, and he shines when his earnestness is most apparent, whether it's the gleeful riffing of ""Monkey Wrench"" and ""This Is a Call"", or the tortured romantic angst of ""The Best of You"".</p>
<p>As a compilation, <i>Greatest Hits</i> offers few surprises other than that Grohl somehow resisted the temptation to title this thing <i>The Best of Foo</i>. Though the record conspicuously lacks the band's breakthrough single, ""I'll Stick Around"", the first 13 tracks make good on the promise of the title and provide a relentless hit parade of modern rock radio staples. Of course, modern-hits compilations are unnecessarily larded with new tracks recorded to promote the set upon release, and this is no exception. Like nearly all songs recorded specifically for these releases, ""Wheels"" and ""Word Forward"" are catchy but uninspired, and have no place among the heavy hitters in this collection. ""Wheels"" is particularly aggravating, sounding something like a half-hearted attempt at a country-rock crossover, which indicates a nervous desperation for continued success that has been absent from Grohl's work to date.</p>
<p>The band surely had better options for non-album tracks. Why not instead include their well-known cover of Prince's ""Darling Nikki"", their soundtrack hit ""The One"", or a new recording of a strong B-side like 1996's ""How I Miss You"" or Grohl's sole Nirvana composition, ""Marigold""? At least those songs would've fit into the general conceit of a career survey. These bonus tracks are contractual obligations and a simple fact of the modern record industry, but Foo Fighters' <i>Greatest Hits</i> is a perfect example of an otherwise valuable catalog release marred by this unnecessary meddling in the interest of stimulating first-week sales.</p></div>"|13658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|7.0|Matthew Perpetua

Full of stops and starts, dynamic swells and swan dives, razor-sharp guitar leads, and dense full-band bludgeons, these 12 tracks swell with parts and counterparts, condensing epics into tightly arranged, executed, and edited two-minute stretches. Within most any given track, Baroness twist between feelings of triumph and trouble, elation and depletion, playing all with unequal parts grace and grit. When those extremes and the sonic care that goes into creating them win over, the <i>Blue Record</i> feels like a marathon where everyone wins. That description, however, runs the risk of making Baroness' triumphant follow-up to 2007's <i>Red Album</i> seem like a laborious listen. It's not: Via expert pacing and meticulous sequencing, those peaks and valleys arise precisely where they should, creating an experience that feels more like a sunny ride in a sports car than anything resembling hard work.</p>
<p>No, Baroness, along with producer and mixer John Congleton, have done all of the heavy lifting for you. Congleton-- more familiar to the indie rock world than the metal set thanks to his work with bands like Black Mountain, Explosions in the Sky, and, more recently, St. Vincent on the texturally astounding <i>Actor-- </i>coaxes more sound out of this four-piece than they've ever allowed. Still using only bass, drums, guitars, John Baizley's full-throated roar, and a touch of piano, Baroness and Congleton render a surprisingly rich palette of sound that's well-suited for atmospheric lulls and electrified roars. Guitarist Pete Adams, new to the band after the departure of Brian Blickle late last year, flanks Baizley now. They make quite the sympathetic pair, lifting from the mid-level, mid-tempo chug that shapes the band's core into the sort of high-flying, skydiving riffs that decorate it effortlessly.</p>
<p>But Baroness are more than the sum of their guitar glories. Drummer Allen Blickle tweaks time habitually. On ""A Horse Called Golgotha"", he crams stacks of beats into tiny fills, adding exclamation marks to a tune that doesn't even need them. And on ""The Gnashing"", he steadily builds from a simple, bar-band plod into the sort of triumphant rumble that sends grown men into mosh pits. Congleton treats all of the pieces like interconnected games of seesaw, constantly cloaking one in the mix to highlight another, keeping it all in motion. For this, ""Jake Leg"" becomes more than the album's bruiser. In the verses, Congleton pulls back the marching drums back to push Baizley's bark to the fore. In the breaks, he pushes everything together, creating a mess of guitars and drums that rolls like a boulder into the next line. Think Torche with greater control and finesse. That is, the song's anthemic quality doesn't get in the way of its million moving parts. One just augments the other.</p>
<p>You're only going to notice details like that when you listen, rewind, and listen again. <i>Blue Record</i> is simply much too fun and kinetic to analyze in real time. With Baroness, one part is always changing while another prepares to do the same, everything working in concert to pull the listener along, too. These songs are invitations that are easy to accept. You'll be excused while digging for your lighter and singing along during ""Steel That Sleeps the Eye"", fingerpicking an air guitar during the serpentine intro to ""O'Er Hell and Hide"" or pumping a fist and shouting, ""Flesh is weak!"" and ""My lip needs a meal,"" during the relentless ""Jake Leg"". Even ""Ogeechee Hymnal"", a slow-burning instrumental ostensibly intended as the mid-album respite, magnetizes with its gorgeous sheets of guitar and bass. When it bleeds into ""A Horse Called Golgotha"", any inkling you might've had to <i>think</i> gets crushed by sheer power. It feels as good as Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"", but it's as accomplished as the best of a masturbatory metal dude like Marc Rizzo.</p>
<p>Baroness makes this all seam so seamless, casual, and spirited, as if four Southern badasses simply walked into a room one afternoon and ripped through this album in a jam. Every song bleeds into the other, and its flow is impeccable. But the whole production-- the peerless sound, the acoustic interludes, the interwoven lyrics-- betray careful, deliberate construction. Still, <i>Blue Record</i> never feels overthought or overworked. These guys are having too much fun for that. Complex enough to reward repetitive listening and compact enough to encourage it, <i>Blue Record</i> is one of the year's most generous hours. Or half-hours. Or, hell, however long the thing is.</p></div>"|13603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13603-blue-record/|8.5|Grayson Currin

I say Boston, you might say chowder or Red Sox or baked beans. For New Orleans, you might say gumbo or Mardi Gras or Katrina. Wichita... a lot of things might come to mind (my #1 is lineman), but soul music is probably not among the first hundred or so. Well, the Smart family begs to differ. Back in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, various Smart brothers (there were eight of them) ruled various aspects of a soul empire that included a band, club, restaurant, record store, and record label. They sent raiding parties to major cities on the West Coast, East Coast, and Third Coast, and cut enough great records to fill a pretty killer compilation.</p>
<p>The Smart Brothers Band was one of a few R&amp;B show bands to rise in Wichita in the late 50s, and by all accounts they delivered in concert, as recounted in Numero's typically extensive liner notes. John and Leroy Smart were the band's animated front line, jumping from table to table in the club while soloing, popping handstands, and dragging audience members onstage in unusual ways-- by grabbing their belt buckles with their teeth and tugging, for instance. Their bass-playing brother Dick was the businessman of the bunch, launching all the ventures listed above apart from the band itself, and he in many ways was the engine under the hood of Wichita's soul scene. The discography of the various Smart Brothers lineups, which themselves went by a few different names, is limited, and here is augmented by recordings made by other artists for Dick Smart's Solo label, many of which feature a similar group of musicians.</p>
<p>Outfits that lasted from the 50s into the 70s weren't that uncommon, and it's always fascinating to hear their evolution as styles changed around them. These tracks, recorded between 1963 and 1975, chart a progression from hard-boogying R&amp;B to deep soul and hard funk noir with a strong social conscience. The earliest sides have a ramshackle quality befitting their low recording budgets and utter obscurity. The Smart Brothers' ""Barefoot Philly"" is an instrumental led by screaming sax and packed with shouted exhortations from the other band members, while the brothers' tracks as the backing band for C.C. ""Baby"" Neal are rough but spirited and clearly the work of talented people. ""I'm Not Ashamed"" is borderline doo-wop slathered with fake crowd noise to imitate the vibe of their shows, and ""Lorraine"" has an interesting drum beat and an atmosphere similar to the frat-rock records of the same era, with lots of in-studio conversation and shouts.</p>
<p>A full 10 years later, Neal was back, leading a band called the Hard Road through a couple of sides of harmony-laden throwback soul with a decidedly more refined sound. In between, Dick Smart made some cool records hampered only by their microscopic distribution range (i.e., Dick Smart's record store). Theron &amp; Darrell's ""It's Your Love"" is a slamming Sam &amp; Dave-style soul track with a wicked bounce in its step and a breakdown that oddly quotes the breakdown of Chicago's ""South California Purples"". Fred Williams &amp; the Jewels Band's ""The Dance Got Old"" is a standup example of the ""name as many dance steps as you can"" micro-genre, and John Smart's Band's ""Herbie's Bag"" is a great R&amp;B show band instrumental-- I can see the brothers doing those backflips while the band digs into this.</p>
<p>The unfortunately-named Chocolate Snow didn't include any Smart Brothers in its multiracial lineup, but their ""It's Like Heaven"" and ""Inflation"", both released for the first time ever here, are outstanding. ""Inflation"" is a great funk-noir track featuring a spoken rumination on unemployment: ""My goodness. You gonna tell me you got no jobs today? You told me last week to come back this week."" There's also an instrumental version that purports to be a cover of the Beatles' ""A Day in the Life"", but it's pretty much unrecognizable as such, and that's probably for the best. Tracks like this make Numero's soul-archeology project more than worthwhile, and <i>Smart's Palace</i> is yet another strong entry in the Eccentric Soul series.

The greatest strength of the genre right now is the fact that there's a unique niche for every producer, or at least those who deign to nichedom instead of making their name as a scene-hopping rhythmic polyglot. So there's something weirdly blank about the idea of a producer who, having already burned through a couple of other pseudonyms, decides to make his name as a post-dubstep figure by picking his own postal code as an alias.</p>
<p>And that might be by design. 2562-- né Dave Huismans, aka A Made Up Sound-- has put the idea across that dubstep is more of a chassis than a full vehicle for his style, and it's not just the geographical distance from Croydon that sets his music apart. With an interest in a wide-spanning range of techno sounds and a background in broken beat, Huismans made his initial impacts with a pair of 2007 singles-- ""Channel Two"" and ""Kameleon""-- that blended mutated, uptempo 2-step rhythms with glassy synths to compellingly frigid effect. And, as the album <i>Aerial</i> proved the following year, it was an aesthetic he was able to draw some intriguing cross-pollinations from, owing as much to classic Orbital as it did the latest sounds out of South London.</p>
<p>But if his new album <i>Unbalance</i> is a progression, it's a regimented one. Where <i>Aerial</i> ran a wide BPM range, used chord progressions that fluctuated between ravey and ambient, and traded on a tension between static-filled negative space and percussive snap, <i>Unbalance</i> is a bit more confined and busy, establishing a narrow tempo window-- quickly paced, with little breathing room-- and sticking to it. It's one of those odd albums where nearly every track sounds good, but it's all so singleminded and monolithic in its approach that taking it in as a whole almost feels smothering.</p>
<p>In single-serving doses, it's easy to get drawn in, and picking any individual track off this album will reveal its own unique touches: the keyboards hacked up into skipping-CD stutters that make up the melodic undercurrent of ""Flashback"", the jump-cut vibes and mosquito Moogs in ""Dinosaur"", the slow build of the title track from floating dead-satellite gristle to densely stammering percussion punctuated by panicked-sounding organ stab chords. And ""Love in Outer Space"", the first single off the album, is one of Huismans' nerviest pieces of drum programming, a frenetic trap/kick/clap Benihana act that becomes only more jolting when a bank of borderline-acid synths jumps in to act as a manic counter-rhythm.</p>
<p>In comparison to <i>Great Lengths</i>-- the latest album from his closest analogue, fellow countryman and stylistic shapeshifter Martyn-- 2562's latest is missing a bit in the area of soulfulness, or much of a human touch at all. That's a serious bonus if you're in the right mindframe; revisiting this album when it's 15 degrees out and it gets dark before 5 p.m. could do it some good. And in the search to find a specific track to single out as a detriment, I couldn't do much worse than finding analogues to tracks where he did certain tricks more deftly-- i.e., the conga drums on ""Narita"" being reminiscent of but not quite as lively as ""Kameleon"". Just keep in mind that listening to this entire album's one-note routine in one sitting-- great as that note can be-- may lead you to believe that 2562 is more indistinct and anonymous than he really is.</p></div>"|13622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13622-unbalance/|6.6|Nate Patrin

And that shade of uncertainty-- that ""sort of""-- is key. Compared to U2's first three albums-- and almost everything that has come afterward-- <i>The Unforgettable Fire</i> is marked by a sketchy in-between-ness that works as a gracious foil to the the band's natural audacity. It's sort of stadium rock, sort of experimental, sort of spiritual, sort of subdued, sort of uncharacteristic, sort of brilliant, sort of a classic.</p>
<p>After their first major breakthrough with 1983's <i>War</i> and its anthems ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""New Year's Day"", U2 could have easily continued to perfect the fist-pumping, flag-waving arena battle cry. Instead, they sought out producer Brian Eno, a bold choice for a band looking to parlay semi-success into something Springsteen-ian. While Eno is now seen as a go-to stadium savior (see: Coldplay's <i>Viva La Vida</i>), back then he was still the guy who coaxed magnificent weirdness out of David Bowie and Talking Heads, to say nothing of his own work, which ranged from prog-rock insanity to elegant wallpaper. The U2/Eno braintrust has since become one of the most out-and-out successful in rock history, but <i>The Unforgettable Fire</i> finds the pair-- along with frequent conspirator Daniel Lanois-- feeling each other out and testing limits. The album ebbs and flows along the spectrum between the spiky, post-punk U2 of old and the impressionistic, Eno-assisted U2 they were yearning to become.</p>
<p>Not only were U2 and Eno an odd match musically, but their personalities clashed in a remarkable way as well. The album's interpersonal drama plays out on a half-hour making-of documentary originally released in 1984 and included in this reissue along with the remastered album and a disc of requisite B-sides and live cuts. While U2 were caricatured as honest and hardworking Irish boys who never met a stone-faced portrait they didn't admire, and Eno was the aloof London aesthete who openly mocked rock convention, you can watch the two subtly influencing each other throughout the intimate documentary. For example, after Bono is seen roiling himself into a frenzy while improvising over ""Pride (In the Name of Love)""-- screaming, sweating, and flailing like a wounded lunatic in the recording booth-- Eno is nearly left speechless before he utters a totally sincere understatement for the ages: ""I must say, this track is really bringing something out in your singing."" The producer's unflappable cool often leads to a fatherly kindness that goes lengths to explain his lasting appeal.</p>
<p>The documentary, much like the album itself, humanizes U2 while fueling the idea that this band's head was completely up its own ass in the 80s. ""I believe the songs are already written, and I think the less you get in the way of them the better,"" says Bono at one point in the film, explaining his muse, ""The minute you take up that pen... you start interfering with the song-- I don't know if that sounds too spiritual."" And while I'm not sure if the idea that God is writing your songs is truly ""spiritual,"" it does sound quite presumptuous. But that's also the beauty of this band; whether in ironic or world-saving mode, their ambition is boundless. This can lead to garish stadium extravaganzas, but it can also birth something like ""Bad"", <i>The Unforgettable Fire</i>'s centerpiece and one of the grandest arena-rock songs ever written.</p>
<p>There's no half-assing ""Bad"". After years of radio repeats, the track seems commonplace, which is a testament to just how much U2 have burrowed their way into the world's collective musical memory. Because this six-minute monoculture moment chronicling the torment of heroin addiction has no discernible chorus. Its hook is a burning build passed down from the Velvet Underground's ""Heroin"". But whereas that song ends with Lou Reed smacked up and despondent-- ""And I guess I just don't know,"" he mutters-- ""Bad"" is the sound of revelation, recovery. ""I'm wide awake!"" belts Bono, triumphant in the face of isolation, desolation, and pretty much every other -ation there is. Once again, U2 put a patently cool underground icon-- this time it's Reed-- through their mega-band filter and end up with a song that sounds just as strong in record-collector headphones as it does to 100,000 fans physically forced to clap along by some primordial urge.</p>
<p>The Reed tribute is cemented on the live version of ""Bad"", filmed at Live Aid and included in this package, where Bono introduces the song with a little ""Satellite of Love"" and ends it riffing on ""Walk on the Wild Side"". In between, the possessed singer jumps down from his high perch onstage to slow dance with a fan, effectively bringing some punk-inspired spontaneity and compassion to an event that typified notions of classic rock heroism. The performance single-handily upped U2's stock in the global rock realm, and it's easy to see why.</p>
<p>So <i>The Unforgettable Fire</i> isn't U2's biggest commercial success (that would be <i>The Joshua Tree</i>) or its most rewarding artistic coup (<i>Achtung Baby</i>), but without it those records would not exist. It's a transitional album of the highest magnitude. The hits-- ""Pride"", ""Bad""-- still hit, and even its sometimes-derided abstractions like ""Promenade"" and ""Elvis Presley and America"" contain enough mystery to keep unraveling 25 years later. The opener tells of an ambiguous return. And ""A Sort of Homecoming"" would come to define this band's fascinating internal struggle between sticking to what they know and venturing toward something undiscovered.</p></div>"|13654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13654-the-unforgettable-fire-deluxe-edition/|9.3|Ryan Dombal

""Rock Co.Kane Flow"" is a fantastic symbiosis of DOOM's many playful styles, but the beat itself feels weightier than what we're used to from De La and the stakes higher (ahem) than what we're used to from DOOM when he guests on a track.  The other high(er)-profile collaborations on <i>Unexpected </i>don't always fare as well-- while ""Da Supafriendz"" spotlights a nerdy side of Vast Aire that often goes overlooked amidst Cannibal Ox's doomsayer image, ""Fly That Knot"" is the second hopelessly corny track DOOM's done with Talib Kweli (see also: ""Old School"" from <i>The Mouse and the Mask</i>) and most of the blame lies with Kweli's increasing ineptitude at hook-writing, it's clear these two share more camaraderie than chemistry.</p>
<p>So, <i>Unexpected Guests </i>would appear to be a primer of DOOM's work on <i>other </i>people's albums... except when it's not. Even the most modest DOOM discographers likely know ""?"", a track with Kurious that dates back to 1999's <i>Operation: Doomsday</i>. If we're opening it up to collaborations from actual DOOM albums, why nothing from <i>Madvillainy</i>, or even career highlights like ""Let Me Watch"" or ""Rapp Snitch Knishes""?</p>
<p>Well, we can at least be sure this is a compilation of tracks DOOM raps on, right? Sure, except when it isn't: ""E.N.Y. House"", a DOOM production taken from Masta Killa's underwhelming sophomore album <i>Made in Brooklyn</i> is a entropic flop, two lackadaisical approaches that never seem to mesh, though the ""Street Corners (Remix)"" fares better when Inspectah Deck and GZA join the proceedings.</p>
<p><i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">But besides that, </span></i><i>Guests </i>reinforces its inessential nature by presenting, for the most part, a one-dimensional rendering of DOOM as a lyricist. It's not as easy to, um, Mad-lib a verse of parody lyrics as it is for fellow weirdo faves like Cam'ron or Lil Wayne, but you get an idea of what others expect out of DOOM-- a handful of offbeat pop culture references, alcohol abuse, plenty of third-person talk. And if you've ever faced the cold reality of trying to find a liquor store in Atlanta on Sundays, you're sure to get a kick out of ""All Outta Ale"", which combines the bootlegger science of Viktor Vaughn with the unquenchable thirst for booze that marked <i>MM</i>...<i>Food</i>. To say nothing of ""My Favorite Ladies"", which takes the narcotic personification of ""Drink Away the Pain (Situations)"" to its logical extreme.</p>
<p>The thing is, for a guy whose prolificacy was once his most identifiable characteristic, DOOM is still more comfortable in the album mindset than mixtapes-- whether it's structure or just artistic freedom, working under an established alias allows him to branch out into stone-cynical politics (""Cellz"", ""Strange Ways"", ""One Smart Nigger""), storytelling (""Bloody Chain"", ""Let Me Watch""), or any number of experimental flows (""Fancy Clown"", ""Change the Beat""). It's tough to turn down raps like, ""If the price is right he might sing a new smash/ Then laugh and twist his Rollie Fingers moustache,"" and taken in five-minute chunks, <i>Unexpected Guests</i> is undeniably entertaining. But the slapdash stitching of verse after verse of ""wacky"" DOOM manages to make one of the most consistently satisfying rappers go in one ear and out the other.</p></div>"|13643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13643-unexpected-guests/|5.9|Ian Cohen

Things were different before Isaac Hayes made the leap to scoring movies: you had your Beatles vehicles and your concert documentaries, your ripped-from-the-charts soundtracks (Easy Rider) and your film scores that became pop hits (<i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i>). But there was nothing quite like the convergence of popular and cinematic music in <i>Shaft</i>, at least not since Duke Ellington was tapped to soundtrack <i>Anatomy of a Murder</i> 12 years previous. With Shaft, Hayes didn't just break through with a #1 pop album, #1 pop single, and Academy Award, he changed the musical directions of Hollywood and R&amp;B simultaneously. Within two years, damn near everybody in soul had a soundtrack in their discography, resulting in career-defining classics (Curtis Mayfield's <i>Super Fly</i>) as well as creative transitional experiments (Marvin Gaye's <i>Trouble Man</i>). And it hit hard in the other direction, too: by 1973, Bruce Lee and James Bond alike were busting heads to Lalo Schifrin and George Martin scores that threw in the same serpentine wah-wahs and supple funk percussion that nabbed Hayes his Oscar.</p>
<p>And yet most people have a hard time looking past that first song. For all the ""baaaad mother--/ Shut yo' mouth"" rapport and whocka-chicka style that provoked a thousand deconstructions of 1970s attitude, ""Theme from Shaft"" was an intricate overture doubling as a character-establishing theme that made a title card all but redundant, and it proves how easy Hayes' transition from songwriter to film-score composer actually was. The liner notes to Stax's new, remastered Deluxe Edition reissue of the <i>Shaft</i> soundtrack make note of Hayes' previous foray into the field (the semi-obscure Norman Mailer film <i>Maidstone</i>) and the advisement of jazz composer Tom McIntosh to ""just do your thing"" instead of worrying about taking cues from the score to an epic like <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>. But despite his non-traditional approach-- The Isaac Hayes Movement was said to have recorded ""headwise,"" without the use of sheet music-- Hayes reached an ideal midpoint between film scoring convention and R&amp;B auteurism, and <i>Shaft</i> is full of cinematic cues and motifs that came naturally to a musician who'd already pushed the boundaries of symphonic soul two years before on <i>Hot Buttered Soul</i>.</p>
<p>The majority of <i>Shaft</i> is instrumental, with lots of incidental music that runs between a minute to four and change; it's best experienced in the original filmic context but still has a certain appeal on its own. Aside from being a rich vein of sample material (the agitated cricket-chirp guitars in ""Walk From Regio's"" and the simmering, brassy strut of ""No Name Bar"" being two of the richest), these tracks are also an illuminating cross-section of what Hayes and his musicians-- the Bar-Kays, the Movement, and the Memphis Strings &amp; Horns-- were capable of. The Hammond-driven ""Bumpy's Lament"" is the most distinctive nod to Stax as it existed in both the mid 60s and the early 70s, combining the grittiness of gospel roots with opulent strings and flutes. ""Ellie's Love Theme"" and ""Shaft Strikes Again"" take it even further, grafting Burt Bacharach/Hal David light-pop melodies into the mix to add an undercurrent of upscale sophistication. And the nods to jazz (the Wes Montgomery-esque guitars in ""Café Regio's"") and blues (""Bumpy's Blues"", one flying-V and raspy-smooth drawl away from being an Albert King single) were, if anything, emblematic of how versatile the Stax/Enterprise ""house style"" had actually become.</p>
<p>There are still a couple moments of Isaac Hayes as we know him in a more traditional, non-cinematic sense, even though one of them isn't just montage-ready but a sort of montage in itself. ""Soulsville"" is one of the quintessential 70s slice-of-life-as-protest songs, and while its travelogue-style breakdown of ghetto strife is a now-familiar theme, it's also clearly written as an entreaty for otherwise-oblivious whites to sympathize with Black America's troubles (""The chains that bind him are hard to see/ Unless you take this walk with me""), and its mournful sax might be the most iconic moment outside the title theme. Then there's Hayes as marathon runner: the simmering funk of ""Do Your Thing"" takes vamping to a staggering extent, starting with a slinky backbone and working its way into a manic, wailing-guitar frenzy that seems calculated to top the already-intense climax of Hayes' own ""Walk on By"". It's that rare 19 1/2-minute song that's so propulsive and energetic that it goes by like it's five, though the band does get so exhaustively thorough with wringing every last drop of sweat and power out of its groove that eventually one of the guitarists just starts riffing off the three-note NBC theme for no apparent reason. (Left on the CD/digital version: the sudden, hilariously meta ""fuck it, we're out of time"" needle-scratch ending.)</p>
<p>Within a couple of years of <i>Shaft</i>, Hayes had become so much of a soundtrack celebrity that it briefly threatened to eclipse his other work, and by 1974's <i>Tough Guys</i> and <i>Truck Turner</i> he was able to knock out an entire album's worth of soundtrack-ready funk so easily that he had more than enough time to star in the movies themselves. But while his music never really regressed-- <i>Truck Turner</i>, soundtrack or no, might be his best album of the 70s-- <i>Shaft</i> is where Hayes' meteoric popularity peaked. And for damn good reason: he created a theme song that was both ubiquitous and game-changing. But, as the liner notes reveal, it was the last thing he wrote for the score-- making it a song whose strengths were simply the culmination of an already extensive and finely-crafted soundtrack.</p></div>"|13629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13629-shaft-ost-deluxe-edition/|8.5|Nate Patrin

The Portland-based band known for its spazzy, sweaty live shows is absent on <i>Entropy</i>. Gone are the Prince-ly sex jams and Casio freakouts of debut <i>Secret Lawns</i>, as well as the Rapture-ous yelps and jagged beats of their sophomore effort. Instead, on <i>Entropy</i>, we get tightly constructed piano pop nuggets replete with overdubbed, harmonized vocals and loosely jazzy rhythms.</p>
<p>Written mostly on the piano (a first for the usually guitar-dependent Salas-Humara), the songs on <i>Entropy</i> owe an obvious debt to soft-rock stars like Steely Dan and ELO. Recorded at home in the DIY spirit of their label (Kill Rock Stars), it's an aughts version of louche 1970s pop with a puckish (and punkish) experimental attitude that keeps it from sounding like homage or imitation.</p>
<p>Opening salvo ""Laditudes for Centuries"" sets the tone with its crashing, disorienting piano line, insistent, rubbery guitar riff, and psychedelic vocal harmonies. The song feels strangely spare, despite its myriad elements, thanks to the repetition of each instrument's vamp and the space between the plinky pianos and the jangly guitars. That space is evident throughout <i>Entropy</i>, as pianos collide into shouty choruses but still leave pockets for breath or the anticipation of Kelly's syncopated rhythms. Ever since Kelly joined the band, he has given it a rhythmically sophisticated underpinning, moving Salas-Humara from breakdancing laptop trickster to full on rock'n'roll frontman. And on <i>Entropy</i>, the complex swing of his spastic drumming adds not only energy but also polish to Panther's sound.</p>
<p>The album's title is a clue to its creation. Entropy, as a doctrine, is about disintegration, degeneration, and disorder, and in many ways, <i>Entropy, </i>as an album, feels like the breaking down of a pop record. Cyclical piano lines roil insistently, their dissonant notes rubbing up against each other uncomfortably. Choruses are held together by the tension between Salas-Humara's alternately dreamy and shouty vocals or the hammered piano arpeggios and noodly guitar flourishes. Rhythms dizzily change pace. Songs end abruptly. On ""Bridge on Fire"" and ""Birds That Move"", it's easy to hear the fingerprints of Panther's AM-rock influences-- mathy piano figures, aloof, jazzy drums, an overall sense of cerebral cool-- but they are fractured, as if viewed through the warped lens of a broken mirror.</p>
<p>There are moments, too, in which the pair remind you of their back catalog; ""Springwater"", for example, is the rare track that makes use of Salas-Humara's famed falsetto and features a brief glimpse, about a minute before it ends, of the jittery rhythms and playfully buzzing synthesizers of the band's past. And for those who miss such bleeping dance beats, <i>Entropy</i> ends with a collection of bonus tracks that outnumber the originals-- including remixes by Portland producers Copy, Lips and Ribs, and E*Rock, which prove that these newer songs, though evolved from the band's glitchy past, are still able to be gussied up in an old guise.</p></div>"|13588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13588-entropy/|7.1|Rebecca Raber

""The shift-shapes still shifting like shift-shapes now,"" Richard Youngs sings over a droning see-saw of two-note organ and bass. On paper, the line seems trivial, an empty truism on the level of ""it is what it is."" But he repeats the words as if trying to penetrate them, creating something bigger than literal meaning. In the span of just a few seconds, he makes a fleeting tongue-twister sound like a time-honored hymn.</p>
<p><i>Under Stellar Stream</i> is filled with such fertile repetition. In most of the songs, Youngs sings one simple phrase in one simple melody, adding small variances in the words and even smaller ones in the notes. This might seem like a recipe for monotony, especially since his backing instrumentation is sparse and minimal-- sometimes more an echo than a tangible presence-- and his lyrics are cryptic and elusive. But Youngs' knack for catchy, familiar-sounding lines, which sound plucked from traditional folk songs, makes <i>Under Stellar Steam</i> mesmerizing.</p>
<p>It also makes lengthy repetitions sound surpisingly like fully fleshed songs. Take the second track, ""All Day Monday and Tuesday"", wherein Youngs sings the title phrase 42 straight times, each instance followed by an addendum which itself gets repeated. ""All Day Monday and Tuesday, the fuel of day, the fuel of day,"" he hums over reverberating bass plucks. ""All Day Monday and Tuesday, the machine of time, the machine of time."" As he patiently draws out each syllable, Youngs sounds most like a monk, chanting a mantra in search of meanings below the words' surface. That exercise-like quality is even stronger on the meditative ""My Mind Is in Garlands"". Here Youngs tries to empty his mind by examining it: ""My mind is in my mind/ My mind is in Garlands... My mind the underwhelming... My mind sees a clearing.""</p>
<p>After all this searching repetition, Youngs ends the album with his least repetitive piece. But even though most of the lines in ""The Bells of Spring"" don't recur, the lyrics echo previous themes. ""The underwhelming... I see the clearing,"" he sings in the same bold tones he began with. With its plaintive chords-- reminiscent of the simple piano figures on his 1990 classic <i>Advent</i>-- ""The Bells of Spring"" has the feel of a celebratory breakthrough, as if Youngs' devout chants have finally taken him to the other side. So it's possible that <i>Under Stellar Stream</i> is a journey, and ""The Bells of Spring"" is its climax. But I'd rather think of it more as a cycle without beginning or end-- if only to hope that he might someday return to this entrancing mode.</p></div>"|13647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13647-under-stellar-steam/|7.7|Marc Masters

He sang about human fragility and little yellow spiders, about old folk songs and with old folk singers, about the beauty of beards and the wealth of the world. With a versatile warble and a graceful touch to the guitar, Banhart seemed slightly manic yet strangely endearing, the rare eccentric who could turn the lightest of larks into irresistible bits of tunes. That winter, the magazine <i>Harp</i> likened him to Van Morrison, John Lennon, and Jeff Buckley, saying he possessed ""a deeper connection to the cosmos than most of us share."" By year's end, Banhart had emerged as the preeminent songwriter and personality of what was generally dubbed New Weird America, or freak-folk. He was bound, it seemed, for some bigger glory.</p>
<p>Banhart pursued that career in the most expected fashion: In 2005, he left Young God Records and Michael Gira, the small independent label and producer that had served as his guide, for XL, an international imprint of the label group that controls 4AD, Matador, and Rough Trade. Two subsequently guest-heavy records followed and looked to expand beyond those fundamental early works. Disjointed psychedelia concerned with seahorses, nothing tunes about Chinese children, smeared ballads about the war, the Beatles, and the slow burn of memory: Altogether inconsistent but often interesting, those albums seemed to find Banhart pursuing a global vernacular he'd yet to define. His audience grew, certainly, but, with these experiments, real fame still seemed beyond his grasp. He began dating a Hollywood starlet, hired Neil Young's manager, Elliot Roberts, and landed a big-time booking agent. A spotty supergroup with some friends and a New York rockstar followed, as did a bit role in a teenage romance and songs doled out to soundtracks and commercials. And, earlier this year, he signed to Reprise Records, home to Young, among many others-- a platform, it would seem, for
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
that bigger glory.</p>
<p>So one might assume that now is the time for Banhart to complete that cliché ascendance-- to make a levelheaded album of straightforward songs that stands a chance of selling. Well, maybe next time...</p>
<p>At first glance, <i>What Will We Be</i>-- Banhart's sixth album and his first for Reprise-- does feel a bit like the kind of record that might break him to an audience on the right side of an FM dial or using WiFi at Starbucks. ""16th &amp; Valencia, Roxy Music"", after all, is an agile, escapist folk-disco rave about ""ridin' six white horses"" and ""free dancin'."" ""Rats"" is a Led Zeppelin-baiting anthem with a midsection about, again, dancing, kissing, and general merriment. And from the bright-eyed opener ""Can't Help But Smiling"" through the whispered, pale country boogie of ""Goin Back"", the album's first quarter offers a rather sunny, upbeat initiation. Banhart's writing seems normalized, too: ""Love is the only thing truly worth needing,"" he posits at one point. ""Every kiss that we miss is another life we don't live,"" at another. Love, drinks, drugs, colloquialisms, creation myths: <i>What Will We Be</i> could be a great big common lawn for aged hippies, album-rock veterans, and college-rock kids alike.</p>
<p>But across its 14 tracks and 50 minutes, <i>What Will We Be</i> again sounds like Banhart's attempt to prove he can take risks and sound interesting without his acoustic guitar. A mess of scrambled styles that ostracizes more often than it charms, at least one-third of this record plays like a batch of covers cribbed from one of those Putamayo world-music collections at Whole Foods. ""Angelika"" veers left from its Brazilian-cum-bluegrass lilt to show it can samba and Banhart can twist and yowl in Spanish. ""Foolin'"" splices reggae with the Beatles and succeeds in sounding just slightly less milquetoast than Eric Clapton's turn at island music. Meanwhile, first single ""Baby"" gets goofy about romance (which makes you say ""holy moly"" and feel like a bow-tied kangaroo, apparently) over a flimsy highlife trot.</p>
<p>And every time Banhart lands something genuinely agreeable, he finds a way to hamstring it: ""Walilamdzi"", one of the most wistful tunes in Banhart's catalog, is a simple fingerpicked reverie. Sung in the mostly lost language of Northern California's Pit River Indians, though, it comes with an inherently off-putting defense. And it's not enough that ""The First Song for B"" is the latest in a series of sublime Banhart piano ballads. No, it meanders into the acoustic morass ""The Last Song for B"", where Banhart listlessly intones, ""A movement/ Attunement/ A new dream/ Beyond dream."" Who knew it was so easy to sound more vague than Akron/Family?</p>
<p>In 2004, Banhart sang, ""It's like finding home in an old folk song/ That you've never ever heard/ Still you know every word/ And, for sure, you can sing along."" And that's how those early records felt-- familiar yet foreign, as if Banhart had found and reshaped something we didn't know we'd lost. Favorable reviews of <i>What Will We Be</i> will likely toss off adjectives like multicultural or eclectic and epithets like polyglot or plunderer. ""He's only exploring,"" they'll say. But Banhart's third album of unhinged stylistic exploration feels more like a reach than a quest-- a timid attempt to distract with a grab bag of forms rather than to engage any one idea with vigor and innovation. We're left with songs afraid to stake interesting artistic claims (""Goin Back"" puts the Flying Burrito Brothers in an autoclave) or defend them (see the needlessly circuitous ""Chin Chin &amp; Muck Muck"") for very long. More focused on offering Banhart's international and oddball bona fides than crafting songs that feel at all like home, <i>What Will We Be</i> finds Banhart in need of direction and editing. Or, as Banhart sings on that awful dance tune of his, ""We don't know what to do."" Here's hoping that, someday soon, he may figure it out.</p></div>"|13645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13645-what-will-we-be/|4.0|Grayson Currin

Case in point: Tegan and Sara, who have worked their way up from cult status to wider prominence through a steady regimen of touring and a gradual musical evolution and maturation that's made it harder to ignore their increasingly impressive achievements.</p>
<p>Those achievements peaked to date with 2007's <i>The Con</i>, but that shouldn't negate the merits of the Canadian Quin sisters' somewhat likeminded follow-up, <i>Sainthood</i>. <i>The Con</i>, sympathetically produced by Chris Walla, found Tegan and Sara trading the occasional preciousness and banal power-pop tropes of their earlier work for something more eclectic and personal, and <i>Sainthood</i>, which once again enlists Walla, continues to showcase the pair's confidence and peculiarities.</p>
<p>What's different is that the Quins have closed the aperture ever so slightly, retaining some of the character of the album's predecessor while applying a slightly sharper focus to the songs and their musical scope. In theory, tracks like ""Don't Rush"", ""Hell"", ""The Cure"", and ""The Ocean"" count as power-pop, but tightly wound as they are, they're closer to high-strung 1980s new wave (think: Missing Persons), albeit thankfully short on the attendant affectations and coursing with subtly dark undercurrents. ""I've got the cure for you,"" sings Tegan in ""The Cure"", and in fact, given the enigmatic lyrics, it's unclear if the object of her attention should accept or refuse the help. Or whether they even have a choice.</p>
<p>Those aforementioned songs, incidentally, are Tegan's-- the more pop-oriented of the pair. But to set up such a dialectic does a disservice to sister Sara, whose own pop instincts clear the quirkier hurdles of songs like ""Arrow"" or ""Red Belt"". Certainly, ""On Directing"" or ""Alligator""-- two obvious album highlights, the latter playing like a late-night backroom flip of Madonna's ""Holiday""-- don't lack in hooks, but they're developed with a welcome austerity and Sara's disinclination for easy ""big moment"" build up and release.</p>
<p>Sara's ""Sentimental Tune"" is no less restrained; it could easily go for Kelly Clarkson bombast, and maybe would even be better for it, but kept in check, that song-- like <i>Sainthood</i> as a whole-- achieves a less immediate but perhaps more gratifying impact.<span> </span>The album's infectious, but with enough edge to temper its undeniable desire to connect. Which it does, just on its own terms, a broadcast from two idiosyncratic musical minds whose biggest talent may be in making their most eccentric traits sound downright normal. After all, from the Quin twins' perspective it's the audience that's accessible, and they know just how to reach them.</p></div>"|13644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13644-sainthood/|7.3|Joshua Klein

It's menacing and even potentially alienating. It's a work of loving pastiche with none of the deadening, touchy-feely hesitancy you can get when musicians attempt to wrestle with their heroes and wind up embarrassed by their own hubris halfway through the process.</p>
<p><i>Beak&gt;</i> is off the cuff in the best sense, a burst of itchy inspiration. Many of the same influences colored Portishead's <i>Third</i>, but Beak&gt; unshackle them from singer and song structure, gaining intensity for what it loses in memorability. There's a ruthlessness to Barrow's writing here, especially in regards to rhythm. Barrow understands the appeal of Can in full-tilt flow-motion far better than the average band who earns the comparison because they swipe a Jaki Liebezeit drum pattern every now again</p>
<p>But while the stamp of Cologne's finest is all over <i>Beak&gt;</i>-- mixed with a little Neu! on ""Iron Action""-- Barrow's more interested in figuring out what gave Can's records their vibe, rather than Xeroxing their jams.  ""Pill"" evokes that classic krautrock feeling of wandering clammy castle halls, getting dripped on by condensation as you try to find the band you could swear you heard jamming on one fierce, hypnotic note. All the vocals on <i>Beak&gt;</i> seem to emanate from the far end of one of those hallways, like the mumbly moans of ""I Know"", vocals that don't suggest dread or terror so much as a low-grade but fully saturated eeriness. There's something plain <i>off</i> about Beak's tense vibe -- a creepy hollowing-out of rock's usual boundless energy.</p>
<p>In one sense it's a vibe not so far removed from Portishead proper, minus Beth Gibbons' drama-queening. But it's hard to imagine Portishead ever writing ""Ham Green"", which noodles for a while before dropping the boom with 1970s doom metal's ""let's drink Cisco by the train tracks and call it a seance"" camp menace, funny and coarse in a way you just don't associate with the trio that made Barrow famous. Of course, Beak&gt; don't have Portishead's moments of mannered majesty, either. There's certainly nothing as emotionally overwhelming as ""The Rip"" on <i>Beak&gt;</i>, and compared to <i>Third</i>, this is obviously the ""lesser"" work.</p>
<p>But that looseness and liberating inconsequentiality is kind of the point. You're getting Barrow's obsessions here, unfiltered, and <i>Beak&gt;</i> is as full of odd, compulsive energy as you'd expect from something cranked out in two weeks, made by a guy who probably had creative fuel to burn, considering that his day job took 11 years between their second and third albums. This is Barrow off the leash and free to chase the beat.</p></div>"|13602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13602-beak/|6.9|Jess Harvell

Whether he's trying to erase your head via concrete-slab guitars in Napalm Death, reduce techno to a series of clockwork hammerblows with Final, or massage your pleasure centers with neo-shoegaze in Godflesh, Broadrick's music has a laudable singularity. The three-or-four-song dose mainlines his all-consuming mood of the moment without the potential dilution of trying to fill up a CD.</p>
<p>Broadrick claims to be channeling his long-unused (or presumed non-existent) pop instincts via Jesu, and the band's DNA always has too much of hard rock's cathartic oomph and pop's peaks and valleys to pass for ambient. But Jesu's extended-players like <i>Silver</i>,  <i>Lifeline</i>, and now <i>Opiate Sun</i> do seem to bring out Broadrick's more memorable riffs and choruses. If nothing else, they foreground those riffs and ringing climaxes in a way that the hour-plus ebb-and-flow of <i>Jesu</i> or <i>Conqueror</i> isn't designed to do.</p>
<p><i>Opiate Sun</i> isn't as good as the all-over bodiless sparkle of <i>Lifeline</i>, which may be the best non-collaborative release in Broadrick's unwieldy discography. It's more of a Jesu sampler, a four-song distillation of the band's major modes, with some of Broadrick's most accessible, ingratiating songwriting-- radio-ready if not for the tempos and the fuzz.</p>
<p>""Losing Streak"" and the title track are more or less arena alt-rock at a snail's pace, almost cuddly and triumphant enough to be a Foo Fighters single, or maybe Probot if Dave Grohl had drafted Kevin Shields instead of Lemmy. (Plus, I swear, a hint of slow-motion southern rock grandeur in ""Losing Streak""'s mid-song solo.)  ""Deflated"" is one of those oxymorons Jesu do so well-- the angelic dirge-- with bass skirting doom metal while the guitar auditions for some early-1990s Creation Records A&amp;R dude. ""Morning Light"" really <i>is</i> doom, the only out-and-out metal tune here, skewed only by Broadrick's multi-tracked sad-dude vox. Add it all up and (more or less) you've got Jesu.</p>
<p>So <i>Opiate Sun</i> is both the most recent fix for Jesu addicts anxiously awaiting album <i>número tres</i>, and an easy-access jump-on point for not-quite-yet-fans. <i>Opiate Sun</i>'s heavy enough to act as gateway drug for those who still know Broadrick only as the guy behind Godflesh's decade-long bad day (if such creatures even exist). It will please the post-'gaze guitar-texture freaks who cream on contact with sonorous feedback. And it's memorable enough to hook those one-and-done consumers of the album-abjuring age. Not bad for four songs.</p></div>"|13600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13600-opiate-sun/|7.0|Jess Harvell

When I interviewed Devendra Banhart around that time, Banhart made a big point about how the new weird America vanguard wasn't actually folk at all, pointing out along the way that the Espers folks were all big Sabbath fans. Made perfect sense. Chuck Eddy (my former editor at <i>The Village Voice</i>), once pointed out that that first album-- and the one after it, 2006's <i>II</i>-- sounded like wispy, atmospheric goth-metal (Katatonia, say, or Candlemass) with all the metal stuff stripped away. Totally true. It also sounded something like screwed-and-chopped Renn Faire music. It was some seriously blissed-out opium-den shit.</p>
<p>On <i>III</i> opener ""I Can't See Clear"", something's different. The tempo has crept up a couple of notches. The drums are actually audible in the mix. Meg Baird's voice remains as otherworldly as ever, but she's using it to sing a relatively straightforward melody. In short, ""I Can't See Clear"" sounds like pure Renn Faire music-- not screwed, not chopped, just straight. There's still a great little psych guitar lead in there, but the addictive gloom of previous albums is gone. And, for the most part, it stays gone throughout <i>III</i>. Only one song breaks the six-minute barrier. The vocals, from Baird and leader Greg Weeks, aren't quite so buried in the mix. The arrangements come relatively packed and, at times, almost choked or cluttered. When violins start dive-bombing the lovely ethereal acoustic harmonies of ""Sightings"", for instance, it's like the band is actively resisting the afghan-rug rapture they're capable of.</p>
<p>So what we've got here is Espers' move toward simplicity and directness, a look that doesn't suit them especially well. Those arrangements are a big part of the problem. Weeks has numbers at his disposal-- the first time I saw Espers live, they peaked at 12 people onstage. And on <i>III</i>, he apparently can't resist using those numbers. So moments that would've worked fine with just an acoustic guitar or a murmuring organ get both, plus a spindly violin or a flanged-out electric guitar or some kind of mandolin thing. When you're using all these folks to crank out some sort of stoned drone-raga, it works a whole lot better than when you're trying to play a simple folk song. The songs on <i>III</i> seem to want to be simple folk songs. And unlike on previous albums, the players aren't always pushing each other higher into new celestial realms. Sometimes, they're just getting in each other's way.</p>
<p>And yet there's an implacable heaviness to this band that <i>III</i> doesn't even come close to dissipating. Moments on the album rank among the band's heaviest, and a few of the riffs here (on ""That Which Darkly Thrives"", on ""Meridian"") could be just utterly kick-ass stoner metal riffs if played on huge distorted guitars rather than tiny lutes or whatever. If Espers don't float off into the ether on <i>III</i> as often as they once did, they still get closer, more often, than just about anyone else who came to prominence during our last great freak-folk wave. Long may they eerily flutter.</p></div>"|13642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13642-iii/|6.1|Tom Breihan

They don't have a <i>Daydream Nation</i>, a <i>Bee Thousand</i>, an <i>Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i>, or a <i>Thriller</i>. The band has a large number of classic albums, and each is distinct enough to have its own passionate partisans and detractors. Except for the most hardcore fans, most anyone with a love for R.E.M. seems to have some cut-off point where their interest falls off dramatically. For older fans, it's often the bombastic arena fodder of <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i> and <i>Document</i>. If you fell for the group at the height of ""college rock"" in the late 1980s, there is a good chance that you either tuned out during that strange cultural moment when they achieved their greatest commercial success as a morbid chamber pop outfit, or the even weirder abrasive day-glo glam-rock phase that came immediately afterward. More obviously, the departure of the band's original drummer and co-songwriter Bill Berry practically gave a large chunk of their audience permission to jump ship and/or casually dismiss their post-Berry material.</p>
<p>Part of the problem in how people understand the band's catalog is that there is no adequate career-spanning retrospective for R.E.M., and, almost as if by design, their body of work does not fit comfortably into a tidy narrative spanning from 1982's <i>Chronic Town</i> on through the present day. The three existing collections that focus on their IRS Records albums service that period well, but at this point those releases amount to only the first act of the band's story. The only hits collection focused on their Warner Bros. output is an unfortunate mess that omits songs like ""Shiny Happy People"", ""Drive"", and ""Bang and Blame"" in favor of less popular singles and lackluster bonus tracks that needlessly distort chronology.</p>
<p>Whereas artists with similarly sprawling discographies with multiple peaks, such as David Bowie, Bob Dylan, and Prince, have anthologies and singles compilations that satisfy casual listeners and provide a useful starting point for new fans, the hit-centric approach has a perverse way of underselling R.E.M. and their legacy. ""Shiny Happy People"", ""Stand"", and ""Everybody Hurts"" may be excellent songs, but they are not particularly representative of the band's core identity as a folk-tinged rock band.</p>
<p><i>Live at the Olympia</i>, a 39-song live album recorded over a five-night public rehearsal at a small venue in Dublin in 2007, is not the ideal gateway collection the band needs, but it does a provide an intriguing tour through the band's body of work that avoids obvious selections and highlights deep cuts and forgotten favorites. About a third of the set is comprised of raw and/or unfinished drafts of songs that would later turn up on 2008's <i>Accelerate</i>. The rest comes across like an alternate universe version of R.E.M. that made all the same records as in our world, but never had a significant hit after 1985's ""Driver 8"", and thus do not feel pressure to perform anything but whatever feels best in the moment.</p>
<p>The tracklisting is heavy on early-80s material-- five tunes from <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i>, just over half of <i>Reckoning</i>, all but one cut off of <i>Chronic Town</i>. From there on out, they play at least one song from every album aside from <i>Green</i>, <i>Out of Time</i>, and <i>Up</i>. Their choices are often surprising, and a large chunk of the selections had not been performed in well over a decade, in some cases nearly 20 years. Michael Stipe's stage banter is self-deprecating, calling to attention how long it had been since revisiting some of the songs, and commenting on the crudeness and opacity of his early lyrics. There's a bit of nostalgia at play here, for sure, but it's very clear that this is not a desperate attempt to ingratiate themselves to older fans but instead a healthy reexamination of previous work in an attempt to reconnect with the essence of being a rock'n'roll band after nearly a decade of being more of a studio ensemble.</p>
<p>Despite their longevity and numerous live concert films, <i>Live at the Olympia</i> is only R.E.M.'s second full-length live record. Their previous live album (which doubled as a DVD set) was released only a few months after the recording of these rehearsal concerts in 2007, and the difference between the two releases is quite stark. <i>R.E.M. Live</i> was tight, polished, and context-free, and as such was rather boring, even if it included several top-notch performances. Though nothing on <i>Live at the Olympia</i> matches or surpasses the group's studio recordings, the loose, playful, and occasionally sloppy performances are far more listenable. Sitting through all 39 tracks is hardly a chore if you already like most or all of the songs, and only the previously unreleased <i>Accelerate</i> outtake ""On the Fly"" and the <i>Around the Sun</i> dud ""The Worst Joke Ever"" drag at the momentum of the sequencing. The band sounds casual but charged with urgency and purpose as it attempts to rejuvenate itself and work its way out of the bad habits that yielded the sterility of <i>Reveal</i> and <i>Around the Sun</i>. Muscle memory guides them through spirited takes on ""Harborcoat"", ""Circus Envy"", ""Carnival of Sorts (Box Cars)"", and ""These Days"", while hunger for relevance and enmity directed toward the Bush administration give <i>Accelerate</i> numbers like ""Living Well Is the Best Revenge"", ""Horse to Water"", and ""Man-Sized Wreath"" a rush of vibrancy and vitality.</p>
<p>The remarkable thing about <i>Live at the Olympia</i> is that, despite all appearances to the contrary, it actually has utility for people other than R.E.M. completists. The notion of a 2xCD set of rehearsal recordings smacks of unnecessary indulgence, but whether you take this as an alternative canon of R.E.M. music or a document of a band working hard to find its future by revisiting its past, the album is successful in providing a new perspective on a classic group desperately in need of a new narrative thread. Though it's doubtful that many uninitiated listeners or lapsed fans will find their way to this record, it does serve as a compelling argument in favor of a staggering body of work that is too often dismissed or outright ignored by modern indie audiences simply because the group had the nerve to keep making new material rather than retiring with a neat, easily digestible discography. This is definitely not the accessible, carefully curated survey their catalog deserves, but it's close enough for now.</p></div>"|13641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13641-live-at-the-olympia/|7.4|Matthew Perpetua

This generation might not remember Black Flag, so here's a refresher. In the early 1980s, Black Flag and peers like Bad Brains and Minor Threat took punk beyond ""three chords and the truth."" The result was hardcore punk. It was deliberately ugly and harsh; Clash-fetishizing critics have mostly ignored it. Black Flag epitomized DIY-- they booked their own shows, handed out their own flyers, rehearsed with military discipline, and put out records on guitarist Greg Ginn's label, SST. Despite shifting lineups, their mission never wavered: to destroy.</p>
<p>Destruction isn't Converge's agenda. They differ from Black Flag in that aspect: They build things up, not tear them down. But they can do so because of Black Flag's groundwork. Black Flag made it okay to fight cops, to fight fans, and to do what punk always promised but rarely did: be oneself. The band was both explosive and implosive. It was destined to end.</p>
<p>Converge have learned from Black Flag's mistakes. They work as a team and have taken DIY to new levels. Singer Jacob Bannon runs the Deathwish, Inc. label and does artwork for Converge and other bands. Guitarist Kurt Ballou runs a recording studio and has become this generation's Steve Albini. Bassist Nate Newton and drummer Ben Koller have made waves with other bands like Doomriders and Cave In. Together, they whip up a catharsis matched by few. They play hard and wear their hearts on their sleeves. As a result, kids in droves wear Converge on their sleeves. (The band's Twitter handle is ""convergecult."") No other current punk band's imagery is as iconic. The face on the cover of 2001's <i>Jane Doe</i>, the hand on the cover of 2004's <i>You Fail Me</i>-- they are the Black Flag bars of today.</p>
<p>The band wasn't always so potent. It took a few albums to work through a wiry hybrid of mathcore and metal. <i>Jane Doe</i> was Converge's watershed, honing their sound to a lean, abrasive essence. Over <i>You Fail Me</i> and 2006's <i>No Heroes</i>, it expanded to include slower, abstract sludge. Black Flag went through a similar transformation. Their landmark album <i>My War</i> was equal parts lightning and Black Sabbath. <i>Axe to Fall</i> is Converge's <i>My War</i>.</p>
<p>The album is, to quote <i>The Exorcist </i>and Pantera, a vulgar display of power. Bannon's howl is exfoliating. His lyrics aren't hard to parse: ""I need to learn to love me""; ""No longer feel anyone/ No longer fear anything."" Basic stuff, but it reaches deep and pulls no punches. Ballou's guitar dials up the crackle of Metallica's <i>Kill 'Em All</i>. It gallops, shoots electric arcs, dives down to subterranean depths. Ballou mines the upper register more than ever before, turning leads into leitmotifs. The frenzied pull-offs in ""Dark Horse"" are pure Kirk Hammett; the supercharged chug of ""Reap What You Sow"" recalls the fire of early Megadeth. Ballou isn't really playing metal-- his band is too short-haired and quirky for that-- but he's out-metalling 99% of metal bands today. The title track rotates through thrash beats, blastbeats, and d-beats like a race car driver shifting gears. It's fast, greasy, and loud as a motherfucker.</p>
<p><i>Axe to Fall</i> isn't all axes, though. It's also anvils and stone pillows and beds of fallen leaves. The record is perfectly sequenced. It starts with three seamless barnburners, then settles into smooth toggling between slow and fast. The slow numbers likely won't get live airing-- kids prefer speed-- but they're amazing constructions of texture and friction. Near the end, piano and glockenspiel make like Tom Waits and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. They're elegiac and haunting, an inversion of the napalm death that preceded them. A huge array of guests help out, representing acts like Disfear, 108, Genghis Tron, and Neurosis. They are too many to list, but the bottom line is, they work. Whether they're yelling, singing, or laying down leads, they fit their songs. And that in itself is fitting.</p></div>"|13625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13625-axe-to-fall/|8.5|Cosmo Lee

The ""let's"" part I get-- the Olympia, Wash., group's second K Records LP is definitely a team effort, switching up between three complementary vocalists and they're on a label almost synonymous with community. But it's a major stretch to think about this remarkably sunny album soundtracking the construction of <i>anything</i>, let alone something intended to keep mother nature out.</p>
<p>Opener ""Breathing"" is certainly one for the beach chairs, a lulling piece of Pac-NW by way of Glasgow tunesmithery, but don't lose sight of how carefully it's composed. There's plenty going on, but it never feels like these instruments are fighting for space-- tambourines shake in and out of the mix, along with piano tones, acoustic strums, and glittering electric leads. It's indicative of LAKE's ability to sound simultaneously airy and earthy. Eli Moore's sleepy vocals deliver a catchy but subtly complex song, while Karl Blau's production lends a natural but never Spartan tidiness.  Similarly, ""Loose Wind"" is gorgeous, threatening to drift off into the ether before a surprisingly clangorous bridge leads into one of <i>Roof</i>'s many sumptuous horn charts.</p>
<p>But it's unfair to play these guys off as softies: ""Sing 99 &amp; 90"" sports a deceptively rugged garage-rock arrangement to back up some clever back and forth between the vocals. A shroud of reverb surrounds the harmonies of exploratory midpoint ""The Roof Caves In"", before a strange, dissonant guitar riff leads it off the grid. Minutes later, ""Remote Control Cars"" is likely the slinkiest song ever written about camping, but even as an instrumental, it shows LAKE's ease with more soul-inflected sounds, working in the album's most buoyant horn chart.</p>
<p>Perhaps most impressive is how <i>Let's Build a Roof </i>traverses so much ground without making a big deal about it. Between the polyrhythmic ""Gravel"" and ""Madagascar""'s sojourn into Margaritaville, it's amazing that LAKE never seem to be playing to the hackey-sack set. Similarly, closer ""Christmas Island"" cops a Camera Obscura feel without sounding derivative. So yeah, maybe <i>Let's Build a Roof </i>isn't a good indication of what to expect here: <i>Oh, the Places We'll Go </i>might've been the name of their <i>last </i>album, but it captures the playfulness and easygoing adventure of this outing as well.</p></div>"|13613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13613-lets-build-a-roof/|7.8|Ian Cohen

For that matter, several of the songs on that film's breakthrough soundtrack precede the film, too. In fact, ""Falling Slowly""-- the standout track from the film and the song that won the Swell Season its Academy Award for Best Original Song-- first appeared on the Swell Season's 2006 debut and soon after on <i>The Cost</i>-- the sixth album by Hansard's underdog band the Frames.</p>
<p>Which all goes to show the power of a prescribed narrative to trump the natural progression of a real life, though in the case of the Swell Season Hansard and Irglova have made it increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction. The film focused on two struggling musicians falling in love, and over the course of its making and promotion Hansard and Irglova themselves did indeed become lovers. While no longer a couple, the pair continue to work together in the Swell Season, so it's hard to keep in mind that <i>Strict Joy</i>, the band's second album, is a sequel to its first and not, as the prescribed narrative dictates, a sequel to the film and the emotions it captured.</p>
<p>It is complicated, however, considering this new collection of songs of romance gone wrong and right may in fact be a musical document of an actual break-up. Or, depending on the provenance of each track, a break-up that already happened. Even separated from the impact and influence of the film, a new Swell Season album-- or Frames album, or Hansard album, or Hansard and Irglova album-- would have likely gravitated to similar themes. And yet listening to songs like the fragile, heartbreakingly intimate ""In These Arms"" or the lovely Irglova-led ""Fantasy Man"" free from the pull of <i>Once</i> proves impossible, though never to the disc's detriment. The tracks don't sound forced or awkward as they follow well-trod lyrical roads littered with wounded ""you""s and ""I""s, they sound honest, and an honest love song as always is hard to resist.</p>
<p>Slightly easier to ignore are jazzy, workmanlike Van Morrison nods like ""Low Rising"", ""Feeling the Pull"", and ""Love That Conquers""-- not due to lack of craft or merit but simply due to the familiarity of the model. Elsewhere, when they're not sticking to gorgeously clear-eyed ballads like ""Two Tongues"" or ""I Have Loved You Wrong"", which highlight the duo's vocal chemistry, Hansard and Irglova do right with the atmospheric alt-MOR of ""The Verb"", ""High Horses"", and ""The Rain"", an album highlight that merges the passion of the Frames with the Swell Season's slightly gentler bent.</p>
<p>Now that the prescribed narrative has run its course, it'll be interesting to hear where the pair heads next (assuming they keep it up), not because what they've recorded so far is necessarily exceptional or unique, but because at this point the story is clearly bigger than the band itself. From here on out, the Swell Season is making it up as they go along, and there's no reason <i>Strict Joy</i> shouldn't entice all its new and old fans to come along as well.</p></div>"|13624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13624-strict-joy/|6.5|Joshua Klein

You may not have celebrated, but I'm betting Damian Lazarus did. Lazarus has seen fit to shoehorn Position Normal tracks into his compilations on two occasions-- once in 2000, and again in 2006-- and the little-known act's influence is all over his own debut album, <i>Smoke the Monster Out</i>.</p>
<p>When not stanning for Position Normal, the UK DJ and producer has spent the past 10 years setting himself up as a kind of bellwether for middlebrow trends in house and techno: He co-ran early electroclash label City Rockers, before jumping off at the exact right moment to form his own platform Crosstown Rebels. Like many dance labels in the middle of the decade, the latter imprint smoothly charted the successive rises and falls of electro-house and then minimal as the clued-in European clubber's soundtrack of choice, and Lazarus' <i>Rebel Futurism Session Two</i> mix from 2005 is one of the absolute best snapshots from the center of these stylistic drifts.</p>
<p>How to reconcile a penchant for idiosyncratic, functionless sample collages with a career based on giving the crowd what it wants? At some point Lazarus must have realized that, if you drew a line between these two impulses, in the middle you'd find those ""soundtracks to imaginary films"" that dance producers and rockers both intermittently turn to when they feel like alienating their audiences. So what's remarkable about <i>Smoke the Monster Out</i> is how it pursues this strategy while also sounding inviting and gregarious at every turn. In this, and in the album's clean lines and uncluttered rhythms, Lazarus follows the example of Booka Shade, who have comprehensively staked out this minimal-as-soundtrack territory, for better (their first two full-lengths, their DJ-Kicks mix) or worse (their tepid last album).</p>
<p>Still, Lazarus' impatient, rifling pose feels kind of unique, most ostentatiously on ""Moment"", which flits from forlorn-sounding British nursery rhyming to a smooth Björkalike chanteuse to clipped spoken word to warped baritone mewling, while the music slips from winsome tinkles through steady house pulses, on to clattering percussion, and then eerie strings and horn sections. He knows how to make the transitions subtle, but still, that's a lot of ground to cover. If the ideas-per-track count is slightly lower elsewhere, this is only relative: ""Come &amp; Play"" curiously combines a gorgeous, nervous but torpid house groove with more ethereal vocals and self-conscious samples from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' ""Red Right Hand"" (""with your red hand, come and play,"" the singer acknowledges in some cryptic allusion to copyright). ""Neverending"" is cheerful, fidgety anthemic vocal house whose marvelously fuzzed-out clomp almost makes up for its laconic, semi-Auto-Tuned indie vocals. Closing track ""After Rave Delight"", all haunting chimes and honeyed vocoder choruses, veers between moving and repellant.</p>
<p>But the inviting median position Lazarus occupies hinders as much as helps his cause, as this music seems never quite to satisfy completely any of the goals it sets itself. Only on the 45-second ""King of Fools"" does Lazarus let his sampladelic tendencies run free, with a garbled TV jingle for monster children that's straight Position Normal. Perhaps more surprisingly, there's not a single moment here that feels like it would really blow up a dancefloor, the producer's understanding of groove left underutilized. If this music were darker and more difficult, it might attract a cult following, but I suspect the very audience Lazarus most desperately wants to cultivate will find his halfway-house constructions too obvious in their reliance on melodious emotionalism. This is a shame, but I hope it also acts as a goad: Lazarus owes it to himself and to us find even better ways to make his divergent impulses run together somehow.</p></div>"|13307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13307-smoke-the-monster-out/|6.0|Tim Finney

The grammar's not there, but the idea is: Dubstep-- the nocturnal, claustrophobic subgenera of British electronic music that emerged from garage and 2-step-- is descended from dance music but doesn't sound like it's made for dancing. The tempos feel slow, the mood is usually threatening, lonely, or both. If there's any movement I can imagine going comfortably with dubstep, it's what Three 6 Mafia's DJ Paul rapped about on ""Side 2 Side"", and the standard step at indie-rock shows worldwide: ""I'm in the club posted up, got my arms folded... twistin' my body from side to side.""</p>
<p>Of all the videos of dubstep dancing I clicked through online, two stick out in my mind. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7xhsCzttGc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">One</a> is by an overweight teenager in what is likely his parents' living room, a decorative ship's lifesaver on the wall between what appear to be illustrations of the seaside, a large desktop computer at one end of the room, an open door leading to a yard on the other. A track by the producer Skream comes on, and he starts to move his fists up and down like a child banging steadily on a table, taking very deliberate steps across a carpet. That's it. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfgmjcvUeGs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The other</a> is of two men, one black and one white, dressed in suits, dancing in some kind of white, computer-generated void, as the names of their dance steps flash across the bottom of the screen. My favorite is called ""Lost in the woods (with bewildered stare)"". I don't know if the comedy was intentional. Either way, it's a sign that dubstep has reached a particular position of cultural importance: hundreds of thousands of people are watching a suburban kid dance to it on YouTube.</p>
<p>Hyperdub is usually cited as dubstep's most prominent and progressive label, but it's hard to even call most of their releases dubstep, strictly speaking. They've released off-centered hip-hop (Flying Lotus), brooding chill-out music that recasts the chill-out room as a bunker (Kode9 &amp; the Spaceape), and misfit rave music (Zomby). Hyperdub's sound isn't dubstep, it's urban noir in the 21st century, or at least how the 21st century looked in 1970s science fiction: A procession of florescent signs over an empty street. <i>5: Five Years of Hyperdub</i>-- their first CD compilation-- has the tall task of trying to anthologize the label without making it seem like they've run out of ideas. Their solution is sensible: One disc of new material; one disc of classics.</p>
<p>Like any label compilation, <i>5</i> functions as a kind of mission statement: Here's what we've done; here's what we do. Most of the music on it sounds made for the head, not the feet. In a way, it's like a modern analog to Warp's 1992 compilation, <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>, whose sleeve was a picture of an empty armchair in a living room-- electronic music that has a place in the home.</p>
<p>Describing his music to <i>The Guardian</i> in 2007, the producer Burial said, ""I want it to be like a little sanctuary. It's like that 24-hour stand selling tea on a rainy night, glowing in the dark."" His two albums, <i>Burial</i> and <i>Untrue</i>, have more in common with Massive Attack and ambient music than anything you'd hear at a club. Zomby, on the other hand-- whose <i>Where Were U in 92?</i> sounded like jungle and drum'n'bass chewed up by a Game Boy-- described his daily routine to <i>XLR8R</i> magazine as ""lots of rolling joints"" and ""eating some chicken-based dish à la carte."" These guys aren't public faces, they're lost in the crowd-- they're people spacing out in their living rooms, alone. Burial's identity was secret for two years after he started putting out records. Zomby will be photographed only while wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with Hyperdub-- or dubstep in general-- will know most of the classics disc. That's the point. One of the label's first singles-- Kode9 &amp; the Spaceape's bloodless cover of the Specials' ""Ghost Town""-- doesn't even have a beat behind it; it floats. Burial shows up twice, once with ""South London Boroughs"", once with ""Distant Lights"". There's Zomby's nightmarish ""Spliff Dub (Rustie Remix)"", whose sampled vocalist sings, ""One spliff a day keep the evil away,"" over a track of 8-bit garbage and what sounds like synthesizers in a deep fryer. (The music captures weed's paranoia more than its elation-- I mean, is it supposed to make me like pot or fear it?)</p>
<p>The word ""classics"" has a kind of accelerated, lax definition in dance music, and some of the tracks on the second disc are from as recent as earlier this year. The heaviest is Joker's ""Digidesign"", a spacious, bone-simple piece of 80s-style R&amp;B based around a handful of acidic countermelodies, so elegant it almost plays like a jingle.</p>
<p>The first disc-- the new one-- is good, but doesn't hold up to the classics. Those expected to bring it, as it were-- Burial, Zomby, Joker, Flying Lotus-- do, just not in any revelatory ways. Of the bunch, Zomby is probably the most satisfying because he's so hard to pin down: ""Tarantula"" doesn't sound exactly like anything he's released before, and his most recent single, ""Digital Flora""/""Digital Fauna"" doesn't sound like ""Tarantula"". I was never sold on Quarta 330's chiptune routine, nor on Kode9's music either-- their new contributions roll off. The only track that actively perplexes me is Black Chow's ""Purple Smoke"", whose junkshop hip-hop beats are the most brainlessly retro flourish on the whole compilation, and whose come-hither Japanese vocalist confuses sexy with corny. Minor complaints. Hyperdub deserves this: They've reshaped the little world they work in, and they've reached out to a wider one-- whether that world dances or not.</p></div>"|13614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13614-5-five-years-of-hyperdub/|8.2|Mike Powell

Not that the genre really went anywhere. Certain kids still scream through all holes whenever a DJ drops a circa-1998 hiccuping synth line. Dudes like Armin Van Buuren are still compiling mix CDs full of recent tracks with titles like ""Satori Waterfalls"". (Really.) But like most of you reading this, I couldn't set foot in a trance club without a lethal chemical cocktail to mute my sense of shame, and keeping up with the mix CDs and ephemeral whatnot feels a little too pricey when the belt is tightened enough to risk amputation.</p>
<p>So there's a new Tiësto CD, and I think, ""Hooray, a little walk down memory lane in a neighborhood I didn't really get to explore first time out."" Except Tiësto goes and makes some lame crossover electro-pop album larded with guest stars-- Jónsi from Sigur Rós, Kele Okereke from Bloc Party, Tegan and Sara, Nelly Furtado, Dizzee Rascal, which explains why we're writing about the thing in the first place-- that's ""trance"" in the way ""Poker Face"" and the recent crop of Britney singles are ""trance,"" i.e., you have to extend the definition to ""anything uptempo featuring programmed drums and synthesizers."" At which point you might as well throw in Hyperdub and ""Dare to Be Stupid"", too, you know?</p>
<p>The difference between ""prime"" (again, weirded out to be writing this) Tiësto and nu-Tiësto is apparent just by scanning <i>Kaleidoscope</i>'s tracklist. In 2004, the man was still releasing nine-track albums featuring 11-minute voyages into the smiley faced ultraworld. Here we get 17 songs (note noun choice there) averaging your pop-standard four-minutes-and-change-- a sure sign that a producer's shooting for blogland instead of clubland.  On the other hand, this is a guy who released a cackhanded trance version of ""Adagio for Strings"" four years ago, so you might think this change to a popward direction isn't such a bad idea.</p>
<p>But <i>Kaleidoscope</i> is terrible, a masterclass in half-assed dance-meets-pop ""songwriting"" that gets only slightly better when it leans on outright clichés, which Tiësto then beats 'til they're ugly. That's not even counting the times he rips off Todd Edwards (the title track), Justice (""Bend It Like You Don't Care""), and your current dance-rock act of choice (""Escape Me"") in a way that's both shameless and too technically adroit to induce enjoyable eye-rolls. Or the ""love is the message""/""universal harmony"" hippie drivel that becomes way harder to swallow when they stop being six-word catch phrases and start aspiring to actual lyrics (""I Am Strong""). The beats? They dutifully trudge along, never sounding like presets but never remotely wowing you, adding a little electro grit here, a little Van Dykian wax there.</p>
<p>About the only time <i>Kaleidoscope</i> perks up is when it stops fucking around and decides to become a trance album. ""Louder Than Boom"" has to be something of a personal peak/nadir in this regard, with synth effects that sound like god's going for a new high score on his own personal tabletop <i>Galaga</i>. But these cheesy respites are too few and far between to even recommend <i>Kaleidoscope</i> as nostalgia for the trance-deprived. The problem with dance producers trying to reclaim the sounds that pop producers have been swiping for over a decade is that by now the pop producers are just too <i>good</i> at it, along with the added bonus of (sometimes) having singers and (certainly) song-doctors to add that extra special radio pixie dust. When Diddy steals your vocab and starts spitting out gems, you need to come harder than <i>Kaleidoscope</i> in response.</p></div>"|13638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13638-kaleidoscope/|3.8|Jess Harvell

Openly embracing the jazz and vocal standards of the Tin Pan Alley era, McKay, like Day, projects unaltered exuberance, shameless optimism, and brisk and effortless confidence. McKay is certainly more of an eccentric, but both singers carved out careers with a sense of control and precociousness that belied their ages. Each is also a polyglot in a way, working with a range of styles and sounds-- their understated, commanding vocals easily adaptable to a variety of sounds.</p>
<p>All the more ironic then that most people know Day's career only from the playfully innocent films she made in the late 1950s and early 60s, particularly a trio of bedroom comedies co-starring Rock Hudson and Tony Randall. During that run of movies, Day usually portrayed a brash, independent, accomplished career woman (a union boss, a leading advertising executive, a journalism professor) who nevertheless projected both a lack of street smarts and a wholesome attitude toward sex-- she was essentially the original 40-year-old virgin.</p>
<p>On her full-length tribute to the film and music star, <i>Normal as Blueberry Pie</i>, McKay redresses some of these misgivings, covering a wide range of Day's work, from her earliest hit, ""Sentimental Journey"", to ""Send Me No Flowers"", a Burt Bacharach/Hal David song that served as the title track to one of those bedroom comedies. For the most part though, McKay skips the hits, choosing instead lesser-known album and film tracks closely associated with Day along with selections from the Great American Songbook that Day tackled. Irony-free, McKay channels Day's elegance and liveliness on not only swing, Dixieland, and showtunes, but also makes detours into bossa nova and western-inspired songs.</p>
<p>Not for nothing is the whole project named for a lyric from ""(I'm in Love With) A Wonderful Guy"", the <i>South Pacific</i> number that could double as a s
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ummation of Day's persona: It's a song about unaltered glee, feeling overjoyed rather than cynical about love, and aiming to convince others to think the same. One of the song's phrases, ""No more a smart little girl with no heart,"" could practically have been the tagline to most of those Day films above. To McKay, the song's aggressive optimism seems to work as a defiant personal statement to those who'd call her fixations on pre-rock music old-fashioned or a mere affection. (And as a bonus, the <i>South Pacific</i> character it was written for is named Nellie.)</p>
<p>And so Day and McKay each shrug off claims of the corny or clichéd by embracing these qualities, proudly being themselves rather than playing dress-up. Similarly, their communicative, crystal-clear voices project subtlety, giving each a sense of normalcy and approachability. McKay does play with the material, often styling her voice in the sort of close-mic breathiness of the crooner era, or the wistful nouveau-cool of vocal jazz. She doesn't situate the songs in the arrangements of their time, however; instead, she typically leads with her piano and avoids the fuller, orchestral accoutrements that buffered Day's swing-era recordings.</p>
<p>Appropriately, McKay takes the lead here-- embodying Day's time without being completely in debt to it. Her version of ""Sentimental Journey"" jumps immediately into the lyrics, for example, whereas Day's star-making version-- with music written, arranged, and credited to Les Brown-- allowed its creator and his Band of Renown to take center stage for almost half of its run time (as many songs of the day did). Similarly, McKay's version of the jazz standard ""Crazy Rhythm"" is blissfully free of the tap dancing that that dominates Day's version. Decisions like these, plus McKay's obvious affection rather than reverence for the material, make this a tribute rather than a pantomime.</p>
<p><i>Normal</i> is the rare tribute then that actually works to introduce and illuminate the songs it contains. McKay doesn't so much seize ownership of Day's songs as co-star with her hero. And with Day's having slipped from the public consciousness, McKay is presenting music that in many cases here is upwards of a half-century old. With the vogue in major American cities for speakeasy-style cocktails-- see NYC's Rye and Death &amp; Co., Chicago's the Violet Hour and the Whistler, and San Fran's Bourbon &amp; Branch-- it's not as old-fashioned and out of step as it may seem. Death &amp; Co. even features a gin cocktail on its menu called the Sentimental Journey. Don't worry: If you're not ready to take the leap into Doris Day or Les Brown and the Band of Renown, they have another called the Joy Division.</p></div>"|13635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13635-normal-as-blueberry-pie-a-tribute-to-doris-day/|7.4|Scott Plagenhoef

The implication in early recordings by lo-fi luminaries such as Lou Barlow and John Darnielle was that the music was homemade and authentic, and the product was the result of pure inspiration with minimal technological intervention. In the case of Guided By Voices' Robert Pollard, the hum and fuzz of intentionally lousy recordings added aura and a patina of age to his dense audio collages, encouraging the notion that each track was a magical artifact unearthed from some lost, forgotten corner of rock'n'roll history.</p>
<p>In the late 2000s, lo-fi production is a more confusing thing, having shifted from a matter of pragmatism to a sub-genre with its own dogma, canon, and stylistic offshoots. Reasonably decent digital home recording technology has never been more widely available, and as such, the impulse to create deliberately hissy and murky recordings has become more an artistic choice than a practical consideration. This is not meant to be a damning statement. The aesthetics of lo-fi are valid, and there is no reason for this style not to become a tradition unto itself long after technology has moved along.</p>
<p>Annie Sachs, the musician known as Tickley Feather, is an artistic descendant of Robert Pollard. She has released two albums to date, and on both, lo-fi production is used mainly to create ambiance and suggest subtext rather than highlight rawness or spontaneity. Her sophomore effort, <i>Hors d'Oeuvres</i>, is about as sloppy and informal as her self-titled debut from 2008, but it is far more concise and deliberate in its construction. The record is largely successful in evoking a severely addled state of mind, but it fails to convey much more than wooziness. Sachs leans so hard on distortion and reverb that any potentially communicative element to her music is essentially obliterated. She sings on a majority of the cuts, but since her lyrics are entirely incomprehensible, the overall effect is rather like meeting someone who keeps quietly mumbling in your general direction, but mutters a peevish ""nevermind..."" if you ask them to speak up.</p>
<p>Enigmatic evasiveness may be part of Sachs' project, but it denies her art from attaining any sort of depth. At best, Tickley Feather is only superficially interesting, and even then her briefest songs can try even a generous listener's patience. It is difficult not to suspect that her lo-fi approach is actually a preemptive defensive tactic intended to defuse criticism by foregrounding her limitations. If this is the case, Sachs is only holding herself back. Though her songwriting skill is rather amateurish, she occasionally displays a knack for melody that is smothered by her chintzy instrumentation and crude production. ""Trashy Boys"", the album's centerpiece and high point, has the potential to be quite good, but it suffers because Sachs' commitment to her aesthetic trumps her ability to fully commit to her songs. It is not necessary for her to project confidence, certainly not if she actually wants the music to feel shy and low-key, but there is a nagging sense throughout <i>Hors d'Oeuvres</i> that Sachs does not have faith in herself or her material, and it is incredibly off-putting.</p>
<p>Though Sachs' music would be greatly improved by a more assertive spirit and a willingness to fully realize her best ideas, she need not abandon her lo-fi sensibility. Her ear for interesting synthesizer tones is one of her albums' saving graces, and she is generally effective in establishing her desired mood of vaguely sinister nostalgia. The lo-fi sound is not the problem; it's her inability to push her music beyond the realm of insecurity and self-indulgence. She doesn't need to hire a band or work in a studio, but she desperately needs some kind of boldness and ambition.</p></div>"|13566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13566-hors-doeuvres/|3.3|Matthew Perpetua

It's a Carolyn Mark &amp; NQ Arbuckle album. There's a big, slightly frustrating difference. Rather than a full set of songs written and sung by Mark-- songs that typically sparkle with self-deprecating, seen-it-all humor and delivered in her husky, dusky voice-- <i>Let's Just Stay Here</i> pairs her with the Toronto-based alt-country band, splitting singing and songwriting between her and frontman Neville Quinlan. He's a fine singer, with a deep, roughly textured voice that sounds a bit like Richard Buckner after a few years on the rodeo circuit, but as with most artists in this genre, his proximity to Mark reduces him to mediocrity. Really, only Neko Case has sung with Mark and come away unscathed.</p>
<p>To be fair, NQ Arbuckle put up a good fight. Like Mark, Quinlan favors languorous country tunes full of concrete details and proper nouns that evoke the open highway or a decrepit roadhouse or a second-guessed relationship. Looking at life from a similarly skeptical perspective, he's fond of tragicomic lyrics full of grim humor and stabbing insights. ""Just 'cause you got chased by some bull makes you an honorary cowboy,"" he smirks on ""Saskatoon Tonight"", which might actually be a jab at bass player John Dinsmore, who was a bullfighter before joining the group. Not sure that's the guy you want to make fun of, especially when he's holding a big blunt instrument. Quinlan's best moment, however, comes early in the album: ""Officer Down"" is a well-observed consideration of marriage and music that manages to find a kernel of contentment in a tumultuous marriage. ""It's hard to be a good man listening to the Drive-By Truckers,"" he sings, not as an excuse but as a peek at his pathology. I've found just the opposite to be true, actually.</p>
<p>In truth, there's a real spark between him and Mark, who previously sang together on her 2006 duets album, <i>Just Married</i>. Their voices blend well together as they trade off lead and backing duties, although a few more proper duets like ""Itchy Feet"", with its mandolin and wine bottle solos, would have showcased their chemistry a bit better. Mark gets top billing here for a reason. With her warm twang and nonchalant sass, she has an easy way with a song, settling into opener ""All Time Low"" and the closing title track like she's crashing on someone's especially cozy couch. ""You can't get dinner in Reno/ At a place that ain't a casino,"" she sings on ""All Time Low"", making the line sound like both a Zagat critique and a philosophical inquiry. And on ""The 2nd Time"", she turns a simple question-- ""How can the second time be an accident?"" which has a certain tramp-stamp wisdom-- into a massive, ""Hey Jude""-style sing-along, during which she calls out commands that the band and her live audiences can't help but obey.</p>
<p>It takes NQ Arbuckle a few songs to finally find their niche with Mark, but by the album's second half, they've proved themselves a solid backing band. Thanks to a sturdy rhythm section and to the dueling guitars of Quinlan and Peter Kesper, they kick up a rambunctious honkytonk verve that sounds livelier than her last album, 2007's mostly acoustic <i>Nothing Is Free</i>. There's just the right amount of NQ Arbuckle on these songs, but not nearly enough Mark, who gets shunted to the margins of ""Too Sober to Sleep"" and ""When I Come Back"". She's a commanding presence relegated to a supporting role, and that imbalance means <i>Let's Just Stay Here</i> is never quite as rewarding or as satisfying as it should easily be.</p></div>"|13612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13612-lets-just-stay-here/|7.0|Stephen M.

It might have something to do with the track itself, with its elastic, repetitive riff snapping back and forth under Yow's wails and backhanded insults.

(In fairness, what record wouldn't start to go downhill after something like ""Puss""?) The start of ""Boilermaker"" is like coming out of a blackout to find yourself in the middle of a bar fight. It's weird to hear a moment of nothing but the rhythm section for even a few seconds on the track's bridge-- for most of side one, the band are become one singular, heaving <i>thing</i>; the band is completely in step with one another as Yow is free to bellow, wail and hiss over it all.<br/><br/>You can't overestimate Duane Denison's contribution to these records. <span>Few guitarists in rock this side of Thurston Moore or Gang of Four's Andy Gill did as much to </span>tear down and reimagine the form.

After all, these albums were still available and in print. In terms of needing remastering, the CD wasn't exactly a young or uncharted medium at the time, and the guy recording them, Steve Albini, is generally regarded to know what he's doing behind the boards. I'm starting to think that the reissue craze is less about keeping music on the shelves (which is arguably not an issue these days) and more about reminding overwhelmed listeners that records even exist. If someone were to tell me something sounded wrong with the old versions, I would have recommended that the listener locate their volume knob and turn it clockwise.<br/><br/>But then again...the new digipacs and their fold-out inserts for these records look great, and the remastering job was done by Bob Weston (Shellac) and Albini himself. The bonus tracks included are sparse, but are carefully chosen from singles, soundtracks, and live performances. They're separated by a track of silence from the rest of the record, <span>but their additions make sense in the context of each album.</span> Without analyzing each song's waveform, the drums seem a little louder now (rarely if ever a bad thing), and certain moments may pop out a little more, like the atonal feedback in ""Seasick"" that sounds like it may swallow your whole head when heard through headphones. If these reissues needed to be done, then they did them right, and if people really need reminding, so be it: At their best, the Jesus Lizard created some of the best rock records of the 1990s.<br/><br/><i>Head</i> lacks some the high points of later records, save for the essential ""Killer McHann"", but it shows the pieces in place from the beginning-- especially the fearsome rhythm section that asserts itself from the opening moments of ""One Evening"" and throughout. ""If You Had Lips"" also marks the beginning of the satanic rodeo rhythm that would suit them so well throughout their career, often shaking up the second sides of their later albums (see <i>Goat's</i> ""South Mouth"" or <i>Liar’s </i> ""Rope""). The CD reissue includes the <i>Pure</i> EP (as the 1992 CD did), as well as the ""Chrome"" single and live versions of ""Bloody Mary"" and ""Killer McHann"". Guitarist Duane Denison himself calls the album transitional in the new liner notes, and while he's being a little modest, <i>Head</i> can't help but sound a bit thin compared to what would come afterward.<br/><br/>Enter <i>Goat</i>, at a lean and ferocious nine tracks. Singer David Yow is his usually expressive self here: His vocals are tense, funny, and occasionally terrifying, from bullhorn-ready hollering to howls of anguish if the song calls for it. Sometimes he's just making muffled slurping noises, often multi-tracked and through both ears, like some supernatural character in a David Lynch film. Yet it's funny to think that despite how depraved the lyrics may have been (see ""Lady Shoes"" from this album, among many, many others), Yow's most enduring epithet may be calling someone a ""mouth breather."" It might have something to do with the track itself, with its elastic, repetitive riff snapping back and forth under Yow's wails and backhanded insults. The appended live version of ""Seasick"" from 1992 has crowd members audibly calling out for the song moments before it's played, showing how their reputation had been solidified-- <span>and while one song here</span> is called ""Seasick"", the whole record is unpredictable and queasy. Yow and Denison steal the show here <span>somewhat,</span> but the vicious bob of the rhythm section on ""Monkey Trick"" goes way beyond a memorable moment; it's a reason to get up in the morning.<br/><br/><i>Goat</i> and <i>Liar</i> show the band at the obvious peak of their powers. It's splitting hairs to call one record that much better than the other, though <i>Liar</i>'s second half is a little slower and moodier than the tour-de-force of the first side. (In fairness, what record wouldn't start to go downhill after something like ""Puss""?) The start of ""Boilermaker"" is like coming out of a blackout to find yourself in the middle of a bar fight. It's weird to hear a moment of nothing but the rhythm section for even a few seconds on the track's bridge-- for most of side one, the band are become one singular, heaving <i>thing</i>; the band is completely in step with one another as Yow is free to bellow, wail and hiss over it all.<br/><br/>You can't overestimate Duane Denison's contribution to these records. <span>Few guitarists in rock this side of Thurston Moore or Gang of Four's Andy Gill did as much to </span>tear down and reimagine the form. His sound on these records is jagged, minimal, and instantly recognizable. It's hard to pick just one example, but listen to ""Puss"" from <i>Liar</i>, as he uses a wah pedal to make the guitar sound like a hive of angry wasps, and then finds a glassy, piano-like tone in the bridge to let out arpeggios over a rhythm ready for a strip club. Even outside of his tone and feel, the balance he struck between blues-inspired riffs, punk catharsis, and general dissonance is nearly without peer.<br/><br/><i>Down</i> is a little less celebrated than the earlier records-- I don't know how many fans were looking to the Jesus Lizard for subtlety and nuance, but <i>Down</i> shows they were ready for it as musicians. Not to say it isn't heavy, from the swaggering descending riff of ""Fly on the Wall"" to oddly melodic bruisers like ""Destroy Before Reading"" and ""American BB"". But if the jazzy leanings of tracks like ""The Associate"" don't throw you, then Yow's earnest croon on ""Elegy""<span> indicates t</span>hey were ready to mature-- and honestly, as they lost very little of their tempo or edge, they were doing it in all the right ways here.<br/><br/>When people continue to mention Chicago in the early 90s or Touch and Go Records as a brand, they often start with these records. It's worth noting band members hail from Texas-- once home to Roky Erickson, Willie Nelson, and Butthole Surfers-- and Austin is a great place to nurture an individualist streak. Moreover, by the time the Jesus Lizard would release <i>Down</i>, their fourth album, Touch and Go and its subsidiaries were already becoming too diverse a label to be summed up by a handle like ""pigfuck"" or any other name lobbed by journalists at bands like the Jesus Lizard, Shellac, Killdozer, or the many others from that decade. And yet, whenever I try to think of one representative sound for that small pocket of gnashing geniuses, it's the sound of drummer Mac McNeilly and bassist David Sims locking in on the band's heavy, inimitable groove that they perfected over these four records.<br/><br/>For all the breathless praise, the Jesus Lizard weren't necessarily the loudest or the most twisted band out there, or had the singer that exposed himself the most often.

Julian House-- the man behind the Focus Group and the co-founder of Ghost Box records-- has designed Broadcast's album sleeves for years (in addition to work for Primal Scream, Stereolab, and others). The specificity of their aesthetic projects-- and yes, these are bands with ""aesthetic projects""-- is so pronounced that calling them kindred spirits implies too much accident: they're more like co-conspirators.</p>
<p>So <i>Witch Cults of the Radio Age</i> is predictable-- actually, it's surprising that they didn't decide to record something like it earlier. But for all their similarities, Broadcast and the Focus Group approach their peaks in very different ways. Broadcast's music is sensual and chic; it has poise, groove, and sex; it's black eyeliner. Nitsuh Abebe, writing on this site about the band's outtakes collection <i>The Future Crayon</i>, pointed out that they'd become almost expert in mapping weird onto what were ostensibly pop songs. I'd agree, but almost to their discredit. Broadcast wear their idiosyncrasies like bangles-- even when I like their music, it feels like it could change shape at any time. By contrast, the Focus Group's native tongue is the stutter; the music's imbalance is in its DNA. Rarely does it ever coalesce into something intelligible, and when it does, there's usually something smeared overtop to throw it off-course.</p>
<p>Though the album is a collaboration, it's obvious which side anchors which tracks: ""The Be Colony"", sung by Broadcast's Trish Keenan, plays like a nursery rhyme trapped in amber; ""Mr. Beard, You Chatterbox"" is 80 seconds of disjointed harpsichord and flute that flares out into static and echo. Broadcast's contributions are intoxicating and lovely; the Focus Group's sound like a three-legged kitten knocking over teacups. It's refreshing to hear two seemingly similar bands highlight each others' differences, but it's also why<i> </i>their collaboration isn't as impacting as the albums the bands make alone. <i>Witch Cults</i> is like the sound of Broadcast and the Focus Group trying to cast their spells at the same time: Some of the record is great, plenty of it is cross-chatter.</p>
<p>""For me, the paranormal is most powerful when it's unassuming,"" Trish from Broadcast recently told The <i>Wire</i>-- ""not obviously spooky or dark."" She went on to talk about how when she and Broadcast bassist James Cargill moved houses, familiar names and places took on new forms-- for example, their new downstairs neighbor looked exactly like their former roommate's girlfriend. ""Even my mom was replaced by an old toothless poodle."" It's a benign sense of horror and disorientation-- compare it, for example, to Animal Collective's professed interest in slasher movies and all the gross, visceral sounds they integrate into their songs (squish, guts, screams). Europe breeds romantic monsters like Dracula; America breeds disturbed children who grow up to disembody teenagers with mass-market appliances, like Leatherface or Michael Myers. Broadcast and the Focus Group -- together and apart-- offer something a little more prim than the image of someone getting a wooden spike through their eye, but I think the intent is roughly the same: To create a space where, for a second, there's no sense to be made.</p></div>"|13560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13560-investigate-witch-cults-of-the-radio-age/|7.2|Mike Powell

It's a romanticized view perhaps, more applicable to literature and cinema than to actual history, but that doesn't mean the need to travel-- or its cousin, the fear of standing still-- doesn't affect each generation with the force of historical truth. In the 1960s, this wanderlust coincided with a back-to-nature movement and an aggressive military draft, spurring young men to take their worldly possessions on the road to seek adventure and experience.</p>
<p>Most of the acts on the Numero Group's new compilation <i>Wayfaring Strangers: Lonesome Heroes</i> were itinerant in some way: They were nature photographers, hitchhikers, or touring musicians, and almost all of them were hounded by their local draft boards. Some reluctantly enlisted (Tim Ward); others fought their orders and won (Rob Carr); some lost brothers or friends in battle (Jack Hardy); and at least one fled to Europe (Tucker Zimmerman). Their nomadism puts them in sharp contrast to their female counterparts on 2007's <i>Wayfaring Strangers: Ladies From the Canyon</i>. The females are identified more or less with Laurel Canyon, or at least with a brand of folk music closely associated with that place, but as Rob Sevier writes in the <i>Lonesome Heroes</i> liner notes, ""The more positive experience common to these men was time spent on the open road: by car, train, or thumb, the urge to keep moving was pronounced.""</p>
<p>That urge translated into songs emphasizing guitar and voice, with fuller accompaniment only a secondary concern. The implication is that the musicians are making rough sketches on their travels, then fleshing them out during a studio respite. That's certainly the case with Jim Ransom's ""It's So Profound"", which was composed at the top of Independence Pass in Colorado. On the luminous ""As I Walk"", Kalamazoo-based strummer Richard Smyrnios is joined by his sister, who adds ghostly backing vocals, and by a fife player; the simple combination of elements gives the song an out-of-time quality. Jack Hardy managed to corral slightly higher-profile guests on ""The Tailor"", which is punctuation by harmonies from Suzzy and Terre Roche. Les Moore's strange ""Ooh Pah Do Pah Do"" is perhaps the most studio-bound composition here, although his imagery sounds somewhat out of place: ""See those who blow a big nose, see them foul up the air,"" Moore sings very gravely, ""while some in slums suffocate with Kleenex everywhere.""</p>
<p>There's possibly a pointed metaphor buried underneath all that tissue, but on the whole, these songs aren't overtly political, despite the politicized times. They approach these issues either very generally or from a particularly obtuse angle: ""Before"", by then-Buffalo Sabre Jim Schoenfeld, casts a wide net, addressing pollution, violence, war, and unhappiness in their broadest definitions, but rather than an athlete-turned-folkie novelty, the song is redeemed by Schoenfeld's sensitive guitar work and the odd background vocals that hum out a tectonic bass pattern. Similarly, Tucker Zimmerman's ""No Love Lost"" is a downcast send-off to either a friend or perhaps a politician, but underneath all its slang (""I'm not getting heavy because no one here feels you""), it's a deeply sad song and tender, almost whispered performance.</p>
<p>It's difficult to determine if that shared glancing approach is truly reflective of their output or just a byproduct of the compilers' song choices. In fact, there's little connecting these men beyond their acoustic guitars, and that ambiguity gently undercuts this collection as a historical document. Of course, the Numero Group is less concerned with documenting particular scenes than with gathering the detritus of certain movements-- the artists who made great music but never gained notoriety-- and in some ways, the loose organization of <i>Lonesome Heroes</i> reinforces the artists' nomadic isolation. Ultimately and ironically, they make good company for each other.</p></div>"|13540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13540-wayfaring-strangers-lonesome-heroes/|7.7|Stephen M. Deusner

The effect of the trip was not so much musical-- rather than experiment with sitars, tablas, and eastern modalities, the Portland band's third album, <i>Let It Die</i>, is actually their most straightforward set to date. But amid <i>Let It Die</i>'s ragged bar-band workouts, you hear a singer who's had time to peacefully ponder his place in the world, and question the predominant Western values of rat-race competitiveness and material acquisition.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Let It Die </i>isn't dramatic enough to count as a midlife-crisis record, but the album is consumed with midlife stasis: references abound to aging, setting suns, and flames dying out. And yet, that the Shaky Hands opt to wrap these anxieties in unfussy, steady-as-she-goes rockers that suggest a certain shrugged-shoulder resignation, forsaking the jittery energy and textural nuance of 2008's <i>Lunglight</i> for more surface-level classic rock comforts. But while the <i>laissez-faire</i> quality of Delffs' raspy voice makes him an eminently likable mouthpiece, the Shaky Hands aren't an especially incendiary rock'n'roll band: Delff's title-track rant is backed by a standard-issue Rolling Stones strut that doesn't waver for four verse-chorus cycles; the cruise-controlled workout ""Caught in the Storm"" splits the difference between Haight-Ashbury 1967 and the Bowery 1977, but stops cold just as it seems to be accruing some force. Only on the piano-pounded stomper ""Slip Away"" does the band exude an intensity that matches the frustration heard in Delffs' lyrics.</p>
<p>After kicking out the jams (however casually) on the album's first half, the Shaky Hands simmer down even more on <i>Let It Die</i>'s second side, downshifting into cowpoke laments like ""Don't Fail Me Now"" and, with ""Gonna Hold You Tonight"", a rather blatant attempt at a couples-cuddling, lighter-waving acoustic ballad. But the band's playful spirit is still evident in the winsome, piano-rolled lullaby ""Already Gone"", while the album's theme of dead-end ennui is best manifested on the bittersweet ""Allison and the Ancient Eyes"", whose deceptively cheery jangle-pop dressing only makes the unfulfillment described within seem all the more tragic. So, in search of spiritual salvation, Delff looks once again to the Beatles-- namely, John Lennon and George Harrison-- as he transforms the imagine-no-possessions rhetoric of closing piano ballad ""Leave It All"" into a full-on Hare Krishna hymn. <i>Let It Die </i>may speak of the sour times, but, in the end, at least Delffs has found his sweet lord.</p></div>"|13627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13627-let-it-die/|6.4|Stuart Berman

Robinson calls out specific heroes like Tom Petty (recasting ""the waiting is the hardest part"" as ""the whole thing is the hardest part""), Bruce Springsteen (appropriating the Boss' fist-pounding ""hey""! to launch riff-rafting, piano-slamming, sax-soloing ephiphanies), and Bob Dylan (adopting just about every nasal, marble-mouthed vocal trick). Love makes you do strange things.</span></p>
<p>I'm trying to cut Robinson a break because I liked his 2008 self-titled debut, a bleak, disheveled, and frequently wonderful record produced by Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor. That album came together in a couple of weeks in someone's Brooklyn living room, and despite its emotionally fraught preoccupations with addiction, homelessness, and other dead-end, drain-circling scenarios, it sounded lived-in and loose, thanks to the players' casual noise-folk jamming and Robinson's flair for leavening grim scenes with wry humor (best lines: ""Hey boy you're a death head/ I bet you'd be alright in bed/ Still I'll take sleep instead"").</p>
<p><i>Fear</i>, on the other hand, is a clusterfuck of bad pacing, pretentious lyrics histrionically sung, and overseasoned arrangements boiled to a gray mush. Robinson and producer Kyp Malone enjoyed 50 days in the studio (recording it before Robinson's first album was even released), and their shared affection for the classic rock canon, 1970s soul and funk, and complex sonics could have yielded something pretty great instead of the hot mess on hand. ""Hard Row"" makes as good (or bad) a case as any, starting spare and promising with a tight-snapping beat and pulsing guitar, only to slam into a brick wall of sneering synths, lyrics like, ""Honey, it's a hard row/ And it's one that you have to hoe"" (both the Black Keys and OutKast have deployed that awful aphorism to much sharper effect), and, finally, a pumping organ line with all the verve of a carnival carousel's. Then again, you don't know how unfocused this record is until you study ""Death by Dust""'s template, in which a modest Americana ramble segues into a noisy art-guitar solo, then yields to a full orchestra of brass, woodwinds, and the inevitable swooping, valedictory strings. If you happen to like its teeth-clenched, tears-streaming, utterly unearned ending, ""Always an Anchor"", ""The Sound"", ""The 100th of March"", and ""Summer of Fear, Pt. 2"" all repeat the trick.</p>
<p>The album's not a complete wash. When Robinson hews to his fine melodies and checks his more baroque and myopic fan-boy impulses, he gets something like the enjoyable ""Trap Door"" or populist handclapper ""Losing 4 Winners"". But for the most part, the over-styled <i>Fear</i> repudiates Robinson's low-key and actually good debut, which he's now downplaying as a demo never intended for release. Word of advice: Save excuses like that for records that aren't so hot. This one, for example.</p></div>"|13632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13632-summer-of-fear/|4.8|Amy Granzin

On different scales, each has seen its financial fortunes rise the past few years as well. The music industry's troubles are widely known, but indie's stock continues to climb. Phoenix and Animal Collective are two of the year's breakout bands. Jay-Z endorsed Grizzly Bear. Sonic Youth went on ""Gossip Girl"". As reverse indicators of indie rock's increasing popularity, there's the backlash: <i>Slate</i> recently slamming NPR and praising Creed, or recent underground interest in commercial dead ends like lo-fi and glo-fi.</p>
<p>Hollywood has hit up Brooklyn before. <i>New Moon</i>'s soundtrack is melancholy and nocturnal, as befits the book where Edward leaves protagonist Bella for her own good, but it repeats some mistakes from past indie OST close-ups. Yeah, of course, indie rock is ""just"" pop music, but the companion CDs to <i>Garden State</i>, and TV shows such as ""The O.C."", ""Gossip Girl"", and ""Grey's Anatomy"" (all at one time helmed by <i>New Moon</i> music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas) over-emphasized indie's adult-contemporary streak. By contrast, the <i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>, <i>I'm Not There</i>, and Sofia Coppola film soundtracks work partly because they share the same restless disregard for boundaries that indie listeners-- ideally, at least-- aspire toward.</p>
<p>Despite being the soundtrack to a young adult drama, the <i>New Moon</i> album alas leans toward the adult contemporary. It's packed with indie-friendly royalty, but hardly anybody here sounds anything better than pleasant. As usual, Thom Yorke fares best: The jittery synth-rock of the Radiohead frontman's ""Hearing Damage"" shows more of the heart he moved to his sleeve this year on gorgeous cover ""All for the Best"", and then an atmospheric outro steals it away again. Grizzly Bear's ""Slow Life"", with Beach House singer Victoria Legrand, and Bon Iver's ""Roslyn"", with St. Vincent-- both welcome collaborations on paper-- unfortunately fade into ethereal acoustic wallpaper: vaguely pretty, too unremarkable to have noteworthy flaws.</p>
<p>In the battle of the potential radio anthems, Death Cab for Cutie's chiming rocker ""Meet Me on the Equinox"", with its propulsive <i>Narrow Stairs</i> bass and hugely obvious ""everything ends"" chorus, beats the nonsensical baroque-pop of the Killers' ""A White Demon Love Song"". Lykke Li's feedback-streaked piano ballad ""Possibility"" is a relative bright spot, but like the rest of the tracks here, it pales in comparison to the work on her own records.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Editors could finally rid themselves of Interpol comparisons with oppressively maudlin cabaret crooner ""No Sound But the Wind"", but you'll only <i>wish</i> there were no sound. A <i>New Moon</i> remix of Muse's histrionic ""I Belong to You"" mercifully cuts the pain of the six-minute album version in half, with few other apparent improvements. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's smoky acoustic lament ""Done All Wrong"" is probably too hard on itself. The few uptempo tracks here-- the chord-crunching ""Monsters"", by former Longwave frontman Steve Schiltz's Hurricane Bells, or the wobbly Saddle Creek-ishness of L.A. band Sea Wolf's ""The Violet Hour""-- are as overly familiar as they are toe-tapping.</p>
<p>The <i>New Moon</i> OST has all the touchstones of what is considered, by many who consider themselves cognoscenti, ""good"" music-- from Yorke to Grizzly Bear to the more populist Death Cab, Killers, and Muse-- but it uses its tastefulness to solidify the borders of what is acceptable, not to broaden them. Even <i>New Moon</i>'s most adventurous musicians rarely do anything catchy, startling, or moving enough here not to blend into mostly forgettable gothic-romance slurry. Strange as it may seem, not blending in is what some people want. Catchy is what pretty much everybody wants.

And it is  insane, sort of.</p>
<p>The goal of<i> Christmas in  the Heart</i> (all domestic proceeds go to Feeding America, one of the  nation's leading hunger-relief nonprofits) is hardly reinvention.  These are mostly traditional renderings, and even Dylan's craggy,  get-off-my-lawn snarl-- the inadvertent template for decades of idiosyncratic  vocalists-- is topped with a shiny red bow (is that a hint of prim,  finger-snapping croon on ""Do You Hear What I Hear?""). Still: There's  something silly about Christmas music, there's something silly about  Bob Dylan singing ""Christmas Island"" (""How'd ya like to hang  a stocking on a great big coconut tree?""), and there's a lot silly  about the cheesecake portrait of Bettie Page in a Santa suit and garters  that graces the inside CD booklet (a companion piece, perhaps, to the  Hallmark card-aspiring sleigh ride on the cover). Ergo: How seriously  are we supposed to take <i>Christmas in the Heart</i>? And moreover:  How seriously are we supposed to take Bob Dylan in 2009?</p>
<p>It's not hard to presuppose  that Dylan-- who has an entire encyclopedia, dozens of nonfiction  treatises, and at least a handful of college courses dedicated to parsing  his lyrics and intent-- is either deeply irritated or deeply bemused  by his anointment, and is responding to over-the-top canonization by  doing deliberately oddball stuff (see also: leering at underwear models  in a Victoria's Secret commercial). Even the title-- eerily reminiscent  of Kenny Rogers' 1998 turd, <i>Christmas From the Heart</i>-- feels tongue-in-cheek. But maybe that's a trap,  too-- maybe, like zillions of red-blooded, religiously ambiguous American  dudes, Bob Dylan just likes Christmastime and Adriana Lima. And we're  stupid for presuming anything more.</p>
<p>Regardless of intent, <i>Christmas  in the Heart</i> is a surreal and occasionally rousing collection of  gooey holiday ballads, complete with animatronic backing vocals and  Nashville-smooth arrangements. Produced by Dylan-pseudonym Jack Frost and featuring David Hidalgo of Los Lobos (who contributed  some memorable accordion to <i>Together Through Life)</i>, it's a  nice assortment of hymns and popular carols. Like any good gospel singer  (or stand-up comic), Dylan is fully committed: On ""O Come All Ye Faithful  (Adeste Fidelis)"", he crows the first few verses in Latin, and on  the dizzying, Tom Waits-evoking ""Must Be Santa"", he chirps Santa  Facts with frantic, seizure-inducing certainty. And some tracks-- ""Silver Bells"" and ""The First Noel"", in particular-- already  feel familiar, like they've been a part of the holiday vernacular  for years.</p>
<p>Dylan's thing has never been  palatability, and he's clearly enamored with contrast-- in this  case, between his worn, gravel-gargle voice and everything else. And  it's his unhinged vocals that make <i>Christmas in the Heart</i> interesting,  and, in some ways, appropriate to its subject: In practice if not in  theory, Christmas songs aren't about perfect pitch and studied harmonies,  they're about slouching around an out-of-tune piano with your relatives,  sloshing back store-bought eggnog, and hollering songs you learned in kindergarten and have been singing-- with abandon, without training,  without self-consciousness-- nearly all of your life. It's Christmas:  Even Bob Dylan's allowed that.</p></div>"|13615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13615-christmas-in-the-heart/|6.8|Amanda Petrusich

On the one hand, this seems unfair to me, because it always sounds like there's some guilt driving the grudging praise that needs to be alleviated by claiming the new guy in the creative mix is responsible for the much-needed shot-in-the-arm/aesthetic steadying. Not that, say, Thomas Fehlmann is some spring chicken, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>On the other, I can't deny that the Orb's 21st-century discography is pretty inconsistent, both as a body of work and on an album-by-album basis. With that in mind, I listened to the new Orb album, <i>Baghdad Batteries: Orbsessions Vol. III</i>, completely blind. No idea whose hands/brains were responsible for which track. And it's solid enough: entertaining if rarely revelatory, which probably isn't a reasonable expectation anyway, and dangerously stuck between multiple either/ors-- uptempo and downtempo, retro and innovation. And so the Orb go casting around for proven hits.</p>
<p>For the most part, the album keeps from slumping into the kind of pleasantly familiar bulletin from a long-running act, the kind of late-career album that gets shelved after three months in favor of the older, better stuff. <i>Baghdad</i>'s sure hand with the mid-tempo isn't surprising, as the Orb helped invent the rave middle-ground, but unfortunately whimsy and personality can add only so much to Xeroxes. <i>Baghdad</i> recycles recent rave history so frequently that it's got to lean <i>very</i> hard on the Orb's way with beautiful textures to keep listeners from shrugging, sighing, and pulling out the originals.</p>
<p>The first half is muted, drizzly-day ambient-techno-- think ""The Blue Room"" snipped of the reggae-inflections for the post-Berlin generation; a more streamlined version of Jan Jelinek in throbbing 1970s prog weirdness mode; some not-unpleasant nods to the <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> first-wavers, albeit made with slicker tech. Unfortunately, occasionally, this side of <i>Baghdad</i> does slip into outright, unflattering copycat-ism, swiping from both 90s and 00s continental European classics. Opener ""Styrofoam Meltdown"" is such a shameless Chain Reaction jack that it even trots out Monolake's precipitation FX, and ""Dolly Unit"" proves <i>somebody</i> in the Orb camp has been monitoring the Field's rise to clubland acclaim.</p>
<p>Achieving, at their best, a kind of playful conviction, these aren't <i>bad</i> tracks, but they're far too derivative to bother with a third or fourth listen, especially with <i>Hong Kong</i> or <i>From Here We Go Sublime</i> only a click or two away. ""Raven's Reprise"" is the best of <i>Baghdad</i>'s cloning experiments, a truly strange graft of Gas at Wolfgang Voigt's airiest and Terry Riley when he was still nuts for the organ arpeggios. But I can't deny my ears picked up noticeably from track six onward, when things started to get more, well, Orb-esque. The appearance of that old house-meets-dub skank on ""Super Soakers"" feels downright welcome after the preceding pulseless 20 minutes, as does ""Suburban Smog"" with electro stabs further agitating some clattering jazz-house percussion.</p>
<p>But the best tracks on <i>Baghdad</i> are the shortest and least obviously indebted, tacked to the end as if they were outro-style afterthoughts. ""Pebbles"" induces a mini-swoon with just a minute's worth of Lawrence Welk-ian harp runs fed through various fidelity-degrading filters; ""Woodlarking"" reminds me of the disembodied soul-radio moans of Durutti Column's ""Otis"" if Vini Reilly had been briefly obsessed with Kraftwerk. These small-scale charmers make me wish for an album's worth of Orb miniatures, perhaps a more fruitful future avenue as Alex Paterson and pals move into their third decade. Everyone loses if we sit around waiting for another ""Little Fluffy Clouds"", but I can't exactly say who wins if the Orb spend the next 10 years looking for creative juice in other people's records.</p></div>"|13620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13620-baghdad-batteries-orbsessions-vol-iii/|5.4|Jess Harvell

(A movie, too, but we're not that voyeuristic.) <i>The First Days of Spring</i> is rife with heartbreak-- the first line is, ""It's the first day of spring/ And my life is starting over again""-- and, Marling's compliance in their cutesy-poo debut <i>Peaceful, the World Lays Me Down</i> notwithstanding, the number they must've done on each other has made Noah and the Whale sound like an entirely different band. Nothing on <i>Peaceful</i> predicted this change in tone from slick, slaphappy twee to mostly somber, stripped-down folk. Fink sounds more assured beating out demons over psuedo-slowcore than leading the preciousness parade that was Peaceful, and, while Fink's still finding his instrument as a songwriter and Noah and the Whale are still desperately in search of a sound to call their own, <i>Spring</i>'s journey to bummertown proves a way better time than the <i>Peaceful</i>'s cartwheels.</p>
<p>Opener and title track ""The First Days of Spring"" feels immediately less claustrophobic and plink-by-numbers than nearly anything on their debut, little more than strings and twangy guitar and sparingly used tympani bobbing and sweling under Fink's mournful pipes. All these tunes consisting of little more than splashes of piano and guitar, a little percussion clatter, and Fink's front-and-center vocals are quite some change from the whirlygiggery that made Peaceful so tiring. ""My Broken Heart"" has a rangy Neil Youngish quality to it that stands a bit above the din around the rest of the album, but like its predecessors, it doesn't offer too much but platitudes-- ""broken hearts are a fickle thing and complicated, too,"" or, ""I need your light in my life, need your light,"" that sort of thing. Still, it's a valiant effort at finding meaning in the face of all the silly stuff from <i>Peaceful</i>, and the bare sentiment could be suited worse to the spare, sullen music.</p>
<p>There's a huge sidestep in the middle of <i>First Days</i>, the sprightly orchestral ""Instrumental I"" and its follower, ""Love of an Orchestra"". It's the closest thing to <i>Peaceful</i> as you get on <i>Spring</i>, a big bouncy number with swirling instrumentation that's kind of Andrew Lloyd Disney about its goofiness. It works okay in such a small dose, but it'd be strangely placed virtually anywhere on the LP, and while it's a sad song, the fluttery strings create an odd mood shift. By contrast, the end of ""Stranger"" approximates a lighter Stephin Merritt chorus that still sounds roughshod enough to fit in with the rest of the LP better than ""Orchestra"". ""Blue Skies"", ""Slow Glass"", and ""My Door Is Always Open"" stick to the guitar-and-echoey-atmospherics theme; ""Blue Skies"" has an almost Calexico-like quality to it, ""Slow Glass"" sounds like Low, but these arrangements are pretty much stock-and-trade mood-streak rock, nothing that hasn't stood out of the way of better lyrics many times before.</p>
<p>Still, the uniform dishwater feel of the music fits the Xanax-ed sentiments of the lyrics. You never learn much of the particulars of what happened between Fink and Marling-- all you feel is that stuff sucks now more than before. As a lyricist, Fink's too reliant on indistinct yearn, and while you might relate to some of <i>Sprin</i>g's bummed-out bromide, Fink's moping seems too scopic to hit anyone very deep for very long. Sometimes you just put it in a letter.</p></div>"|13621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13621-the-first-days-of-spring/|5.2|Paul Thompson

Németh, a member of the group Radian and co-founder of the Mosz label,  has a background in electro-acoustic improv, low-intensity noise, and  what might be described as full-bodied microsound. Kmet, a guitarist  and member of the group Superlooper, has a similar pedigree. Their debut album, 2005's <i>7 Million</i>, was a rough blend of guitar feedback, bell tones, and buzzing drones-- the music sounded exposed and at the mercy of the elements.</p>
<p>But a strange things happen just two  minutes into ""Roads"", the opening track on their new album  for Thrill Jockey. Out of a delicate scrabble of indeterminate clicks  and clacks-- the sound of a bassy piano string being pulled from its  frame? An underwater recording from a sailboat dock?-- grows the unmistakable  shape of a song. The clanking finds a rhythm, and against a background  of massing strings, a melody arises out of the pitter-patter of glockenspiel  and mbira. Or, in any case, sounds that evoke those worldly instruments: With Lokai, you can never be sure exactly what's being played, sampled,  or processed. But there's no doubting the songliness of the thing. It's  more than mere suggestion, as contrapuntal tones stack up and ambient  rustle settles into an unmistakable groove, a 104-BPM pulse that wouldn't  be out of place on one of Lawrence or Efdemin's more muted 12"" singles.  And then, before you know it, it's gone.</p>
<p>A similar tension animates all nine  tracks here, where musical structure is always on the cusp of dissolving  into pure sound, or possibly vice versa. Usually we assume that tones  are the building blocks of what we perceive as music, but Lokai reverse  that hierarchy. Their ephemeral constructions play with the assumption  that we're hard-wired to recognize patterns in chaos, redirecting our  attention to the chaos inherent in patterns. But if that's a heavy-handed  explanation of their process, fortunately, the music is anything but.  The supple timbres of brushed percussion, bells,  Rhodes, melodica, and guitar are warm, immersive, and somehow deeply reassuring.  The songs lull the listener into such a receptive state that they may  seem much longer than they really are. In reality, only four tracks  stretch beyond the five-minute mark, and barely, at that; the rest run  between two and four minutes. They're sketches that open up into panoramic  landscapes, evoking the vistas of a Caspar David Friedrich with the  brushtrokes of a Klee.</p>
<p>Unlike some of their peers, Lokai are  content here to leave their acoustic sources relatively unvarnished  and unadulterated, unmarked by, say, the foaming granular processes  of Fennesz or Tim Hecker. (A closer comparison might be to Sweden's  Tape or Germany's September Collective.) The duo recorded the album  in Kmet's home studio over the course of four years, and that freedom--  the musicians have described it as ""a joyful process""-- is  felt in the music's unhurried pace and limpid clarity. ""Volver,""  which feels in many ways like the album's gravitational center, rolls  out pensive guitar chords over sinewave drones whose gentle dissonances  create slowly undulating pulses. ""Bruit"", which begins with  muted, rolling toms, slowly masses into a geyser of splash cymbals and  guitar feedback before subsiding into measured hand-drumming, regular  as clockwork. ""Tik"", honeycombed with tightly-looped string  drones, is the album's most luminous track, its intensity a perfect  setup for the final wind-down of ""Roads (Reprise)"", which  returns to the themes introduced in the album's opening track. You're  unlikely to pick the moments apart like this, however. At only 38 minutes  long, the album invites repeat listening and extended wandering through  the labyrinthine passages hidden within its folds.</p></div>"|13552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13552-transition/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

While they've always possessed a knack for melody that has, for their genre,  provided their music with an accessible edge, listeners unaccustomed to blood-curdling screams and metal-scraping drones have had their work cut out for them when searching for the more delicate moments that helped make last year's <i>Street Horrrsing</i> such a stunning listen.</p>
<p><i>Tarot Sport</i> represents a subtler, more mature approach to songwriting and a sharpening of their craft. But moreso, it marks a comprehensive stylistic shift for the duo's sound, from experimental noise with a buried pop sensibility to a sort of modernized electronic take on classic post-rock structures. And impressively, they've made these changes without sacrificing any of the genre-straddling adventurousness that made them intriguing in the first place.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best way to think about their transformation is to consider how the new material relates to post-rock groups like Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. The band has always had an inclination toward sweeping epics (see: ""Sweet Love for Planet Earth""), but instead of using scale as a canvas for brutality/delicacy contrasts, here they repurpose the post-rock format as a digital soundscape. Gone are the shrieks and wailing guitar chords that populated <i>Street Horrrsing; </i><span>instead these songs are built almost wholly with synth and keyboard te</span><span>xtures that originate in dance music.</span></p>
<p>Aiding the shift is producer Andrew Weatherall, who has a long history of infusing rock with dancefloor bounce and drawing the best from his groups. (His helming of Primal Scream's epochal <i>Screamadelica</i> and his remix work with My Bloody Valentine are prime examples.) From the chugging drumbeat of opener ""Surf Solar"" to the chipped-up electro backdrop of finale ""Flight of the Feathered Serpent"", the dynamics and textures of techno are the foundation of the record, making a direct link between <i>Tarot</i> and Weatherall's earlier boundary-defying productions.</p>
<p>All of which is prologue to <i>Tarot Sport</i>'s actual songs, which by and large are pretty freaking incredible. There's a cinematic, storytelling quality to the music, and the climactic builds of longer pieces such as ""The Lisbon Maru""-- with its militaristic drumbeat and huge synth melodies-- conjure the excitement of an oversized movie sequence. ""Surf Solar"", extended from the clipped-length radio edit that emerged online last month, is anxious and menacing by comparison but hits those notes without the histrionics of Fuck Buttons' previous work-- the band seems just too confident here to rely on screeches to get its point across.</p>
<p>Fuck Buttons also master shorter pieces that shift and redirect the record's momentum. Close in spirit to the tribal romp of ""Ribs Out"" from <i>Street Horrrsing--</i> but ultimately more listenable and imaginative-- ""Rough Steez"" envisions industrial techno as locomotive skronk. And ""Phantom Limb"" recalls genre-benders like Liquid Liquid and Gang Gang Dance with its cavernous atmosphere and snaky, complex arrangement. When the band returns to widescreen emotiveness for the triumphant closer ""Flight of the Feathered Serpent"", it feels like a victory lap-- the capper on a record that is a hell of a lot easier to like than even fans of<i> Street Horrrsin</i><i>g</i> would have expected. That was a great record, but <i>Tarot Sport</i> is a cut above. Perhaps surprisingly, it's also a welcoming album-- and one of the best of this already fruitful year.</p></div>"|13617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13617-tarot-sport/|9.0|Joe Colly

Sigur Rós' folkloric melodrama and emotive language made sense as a backdrop for <i>Vanilla Sky</i>, itself a sort of sci-fi fairytale about misplaced and unrequited love starring someone prone to over-excitement. The charged music of Explosions in the Sky fit the open expanses and crushing blows of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>' take on Texas high school football culture (hell, guitarist Munaf Rayani sometimes bends over his instrument like a lineman crouching down into a three-point stance). So it seemed odd that a track by Canadians Do Make Say Think was chosen for the oil industry drama <i>Syriana.</i> Not to say the Toronto post-rock band doesn't make the kind of mesmerizing music suitable for a film score (or that the more tense, overtly politicized<i> </i>music of <i>Godspeed You! Black Emperor </i>might have been a better fit). But DMST can sound so pastoral-- the music was literally recorded in a barn, in some cases-- it may seem to lack the bite for a blood-for-oil flick.</p>
<p>While Do Make Say Think can project a gentle, laid-back vibe-- member Charles Spearin did just finish <i>The Happiness Project</i>-- they're far from spinning their wheels and rehashing post-rock clichés. <i>Other Truths </i>doesn't roughen up the band's jazz-steeped aesthetic. But it does add more dimensions and sharp textures to their songwriting, which continues to get tighter yet wider in scope. Spread across a suite of four lengthy tracks and titled with the same string of verbs as the band's name, the album isn't about momentum as much as it is about transitions. Opener ""Do"" starts with crisp, intertwined guitar lines playing off one another. As the track morphs and unfurls-- cue the slow-build and crescendo-- the themes reappear more charged, parrying with horns and descending into static. ""Make"" quietly delays the payoff, slowly ratcheting things up and marching toward a climax with a floor of tense bass, echoing chants, and sinewy, stretched string notes. When a warm motif of horns and fuzzed guitars begins to cut through the dread, the song's color noticeably shifts. ""Say"" strikes a grandiose yet road-weary tone, as a lonely slide guitar melody gets echoed and expanded by trumpets and churning drums, while ""Think"" may be its companion and comedown, a slow trail set forth by a quivering, reverb-laden guitar line.</p>
<p>Compared to the group's first few albums, filled with echoing melodies reflective of cavernous recording spaces, <i>Other Truths</i> shows Do Make Say Think more adept at sketching out and imagining their own widescreen landscapes. The interplay here is more complex than <i>You, You</i>'<i>re a History in Rust</i>, showcasing restraint and more subtle shifts. Calling instrumental rock ""soundtrack music"" might be stating the obvious. But when it manages to sound as composed and calculated as <i>Other Truths</i>, it isn't meant as a slight.</p></div>"|13595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13595-other-truths/|7.2|Patrick Sisson

""I feel the pressure to change my ways/ All I see are more dark days."" By definition, BYOP was a fleeting endeavor-- a band of fuck-off teens destined to flame out rather than linger on. They wrote songs about food fights, robbing banks, and, like, adventuring; when Pearl declared, ""We ride bikes, cars are for idiots,"" narrow side lanes turned into unfuckwithable alleys of cool. To BYOP, concerns about contentment, love, and mortality were laugh lines. They even turned typical punk rebellion into a cartoon farce.</p>
<p>""Next year I'll be 21/ So look out, world, 'cause I wanna have fun,"" sang Pearl on BYOP's ""Super Soaked"". Now 22, Pearl's name is front and center on <i>Break It Up</i>, her solo bow recorded with BYOP drummer John Eatherly. The zombies and pizza parties of yore are replaced with predicted ""dark days,"" though this Brooklyn by-way-of Nashville badass is still thrashing against maturity as best as she can.</p>
<p>Case in point, here's the singer describing a recent altercation with a fan: ""dude fucked up during the last song by flicking lit cigarettes at me. not cool. i kicked his ass, there was blood, and everyone at the show cheered because he sucked."" In Pearl's world, there's black and white-- and maybe some red. Things that suck get what they deserve, whether they're asshole fans, jerky boyfriends, or simply the notion of growing up. She's an old-school punk in that there's little pretense; she thrashes about onstage because she wants to and not because she thinks it looks cool. According to her Ecstatic Peace label head (and <i>Break It Up</i> guest guitarist/vocalist) Thurston Moore, she's not ""out to impress anybody; she [is] just kicking total ass."" He should know.</p>
<p>As far as ass-kicking goes, there's plenty of it here. Nearly every song is marked with a rough-edged riff from another era, whether it be surf, garage, or girl group. And Pearl's guttural wail is intact. But there are no straight-up, minute-long goofs, and instead of raging on about pitch-perfect nonsense and suburban malaise, Pearl often turns inward. The self-reflection can be reassuring, as on the fizzy, Dave Sitek-assisted Gemini ode ""Ecstatic Appeal"", or deeply troubling, as on the laborious downer ""Retrograde"", where voices in the back of Pearl's mind tell her to ""go on, cut a little bit deeper, see how far we can go."" The LP's best reflective track finds a semi-happy middle ground between those two extremes; ""No Good"" has the singer lambasting herself for being lazy-- ""I've been trying for so long, can't get shit done""-- with the song acting as a fitful solution to the idleness.</p>
<p><i>Break It Up</i> isn't all introspection set to a Stooges beat-- there are still some hell-raiser cartoons. ""Looking for Trouble"" starts off with a classic rock'n'roll quotable (""Never sold my soul to the devil/ Gave it away for free"") but its troublemaker shtick is a little tired-- even Pearl sounds edgeless, as if she's bored with being bad. Better is ""I Hate People"", a knowing caricature co-starring Iggy Pop in full-on crooner mode. ""I hate people, and you do too,"" they sing, relishing their mutual loathing while a pepped-up Motown back beat adds another wink.</p>
<p>Faced with a child star's dilemma of symbolizing infinite irresponsibility, Pearl dips into adulthood admirably on <i>Break It Up</i>. Her frankness makes the record a difficult proposition-- if she continued to shirk and joke like she was 17, it would be dishonest; turning in a collection of mid-tempo songs about twentysomething angst would negate everything she's done leading up to this point. The record never takes a breather, though you get the feeling it's only a matter of time before she attempts her own ""Maps"". And she'll still make you bleed if the mood strikes her. But the breakup of Pearl's old band has seemingly given her a taste of finality. Even a speck of nostalgia turns up on the wistful, winning ""Nashville Shores"". But instead of glossing over the dubiousness of her hometown's seedy watering holes, she highlights all the ""dirty water,"" ""children's cries,"" and ""easy girls"" that make it live. ""Nashville shores, it's all we got,"" she concludes, proudly.</p></div>"|13611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13611-break-it-up/|7.0|Ryan Dombal

Now Grand Archives aim to make a record that can be defined on its own terms. The resulting disc, <i>Keep in Mind Frankenstein</i>,<i> </i>arguably does a good job of establishing a more singular sound for the band, but I'm not so sure their confidence is applied to the right things.</p>
<p>Brooke's voice is nice enough, sort of like a Listerine breath strip-- oddly sweet, papery, and prone to dissolving on contact. On <i>Grand Archives</i>, it proved capable of delivering loopy but ingratiating melodies while exploring some of Sub Pop's more welcoming artistic avenues. <i>Frankenstein </i>occasionally reprises what made its predecessor successful-- ""Oslo Novelist"" and ""Left for All the Strays"" play like folky, half-speed power pop with tightly-strung acoustic chords, trebly leads, and Brooke's corkscrewing vocal lines. But as the tempos slog and the hooks soften in the service of a more uniform mood, those moments feel like brief respites of vigor amidst a record whose pacing feels awfully pokey for something that's barely over a half-hour long.</p>
<p>Whatever menace gets conveyed in the repetitious invocation, ""Someday I will come back,"" from ""Topsy's Revenge"" is overshadowed by a weary arrangement, little more than plinking acoustic strums in a dragging tempo. ""Witchy Park/Tomorrow Will (Take Care of Itself)"" builds to a cyclical, beautifully melancholy refrain but takes about two minutes too many to rustle itself out of slumber, and with the exception of the aforementioned and ""Dig That Crazy Grave""'s blocky percussion, most of <i>Frankenstein </i>just kinda sails by you. Barely-there, near-instrumentals like ""Siren Echo Valley, Pt. 1"" and ""Willoughby"" (as well as actual instrumentals like ""Siren Echo Valley, Pt. 2"") try to turn Brooke and Sera Cahoone's harmonies into load-bearing instruments, but they're neither strong enough harmonically nor interesting enough texturally to feel spare as opposed to merely underwritten.</p>
<p>Maybe we all should've just been careful about what we wished for: For all the adulation accrued by <i>Grand Archives</i>, I can't remember too many people being particularly high on ""The Crime Window"" or ""Breezy No Breezy"", the former sticking out as a gung-ho shoutalong, the latter for being a Calexico-ish curiosity. Lo and behold, either of those are what's missing from <i>Frankenstein--</i> I'd hate to think that founding member Ron Lewis bolted for the Shins because he thought they'd be more attuned to the quirks and rawk he may have brought to the table. It's far from a bad record and fits the bill for the pace of a hungover Sunday. But while hangovers tend to be glorified somewhat as of late, it's worth noting that, most of the time, you're just listlessly waiting for them to pass.</p></div>"|13587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13587-keep-in-mind-frankenstein/|5.0|Ian Cohen

Over the course of a flurry of 7""s, a limited-edition cassette, and <i>two </i>full-length albums-- last spring's self-titled and now <i>Grey-Eyed Girls-- </i>you can hear the sound of a young band busily honing in on what they're good at. In case you weren't tipped off by their almost distractingly evocative band name (should we be thinking of the Only Ones, or the Young Fresh Fellows?), the Fresh &amp; Onlys traffic in jangly garage-pop, balancing psych-rock swagger with generous dollops of sweetly cockeyed melody. Their recordings are lovingly caked with crud, and their jams sometimes veer perilously close to derailing completely<i>,</i> which might seem to lump them in with other San Francisco psych revivalists like Thee Oh Sees and Sic Alps. But the Fresh &amp; Onlys are set apart by an endearingly fussy devotion to songcraft and an understated and unfakeable weirdness. Their self-titled record was fairly straightforward but satisfying garage rock; <i>Grey-Eyed Girls </i>is stranger and more interesting, toning down the swagger and finding a sweet spot somewhere in between uptempo brashness and the quirky vulnerability of Beat Happening.</p>
<p>If the Fresh &amp; Onlys come off as more winsome than your average <i>Nuggets </i>fetishists, part of that might have something to do with their diffident rhythm section, which ensures that they wobble more often than they rock. ""What's His Shadow Still Doing Here"" is a classic piece of Buddy Holly yearning that drags and nearly trips over its own feet, gaining in poignancy and charm whatever it loses in a steady backbeat. ""No Second Guessing"", meanwhile, comes off like a handmade valentine straight from Calvin Johnson: ""Be strong, be wise/ Don't ever question your place in my life,"" Tim Cohen warbles in his unsteady baritone.  ""Dude's Got a Tender Heart"", for its part, is a bad-boy-with-a-heart-of-gold tale that echoes the Crystals' ""He's a Rebel"" over a tin-can approximation of girl-group pop: ""You wouldn't know if you looked at him/ But dude's got a tender heart.""</p>
<p>There are a handful of killer straight-ahead rave-ups as well: The spectacularly catchy ""I'm Gonna Be Your Elevator"" bops along on its ""I'm gonna lift you up/ I'm gonna bring you down"" chorus chant, while ""D.Y."" supplies the Yardbirds-style barn-burner. But the most intriguing numbers branch out into more wigged-out territory, like the B-movie paranoia of ""Invisible Forces"" or ""Clowns (Took My Baby Away)"", the title of which requires no further elucidation. These little weirdo touches help distinguish the Fresh &amp; Onlys from their San Francisco brethren<i>, </i>and throughout <i>Grey-Eyed Girls</i>, their possibly unhealthy familiarity with garage-rock arcana is balanced out by a keen songwriter's eye, and their obsession with the past is elevated by genuine affection and love.</p></div>"|13507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13507-grey-eyed-girls/|7.5|Jayson Greene

Some musicians listen to records to see how they work, check out the competition, or trawl for ideas; by all available evidence, Cox feels records, deeply. If he was born without musical gifts and couldn't sing or play an instrument, one can imagine him working at a record store, amassing an enviable collection while driving people on a message board crazy with the sureness of his detailed opinions. Whatever you think of his exploits as an indie rock media figure, Cox's music fandom is easy to identify with and also offers a portal into his own work.</p>
<p>Atlas Sound, Cox's solo alias, in one sense serves as a sort of laboratory for figuring out what makes some his favorite music tick, away from the expectations of his main band. Two collaborations on <i>Logos</i>, the second Atlas Sound full-length, are excellent examples of how music listening can be absorbed into original work. First is ""Walkabout"", a track Cox wrote and recorded with Noah Lennox from Animal Collective, whom Cox got to know during a European tour. Though Cox's music shades dark and Lennox's is often flecked with uncertainty and doubt, ""Walkabout"" is the sunniest pop tune of either of their careers. Coasting on a buoyant, twinkling keyboard sample, it is a starkly catchy and irresistible, a clattery post-millennial Archies tune that straddles perfectly the border between simple and simplistic. Interestingly, it also sounds very much like a Panda Bear tune.</p>
<p>Then there is Lætitia Sadier of Stereolab, who wrote the lyrics and sings lead on <i>Logos</i>' ""Quick Canal"". The song opens with some gorgeously textured organ chords and soon a steady-state beat and drums rise up in the mix, setting the kind of relaxed-but-propulsive neo-krautrock scene that Stereolab perfected very early on. Here Cox gets to play the part of the late Mary Hansen, adding ""la-di-da"" trills behind Sadier as she intones phrases in her unfailingly lovely, for-the-ages voice. He even throws in a ""Jenny Ondioline""-style rupture about halfway through, sending the track into a breathtaking shoegaze section for its final four minutes, wherein it floats magisterially on a pillow of shifting guitar feedback. ""Quick Canal"" is almost nine minutes long and it doesn't waste a second.</p>
<p>On these tracks, the confidence Cox shows in melting his aesthetic into the soundworld of other musicians is striking-- both are unqualified successes, very different from each other but among the best things Cox has ever done. But they also sound a lot like the music his collaborators are known for. Cox's sympathetic support and sense of how to construct songs with others suggests a desire to expand the parameters of what Atlas Sound can be. And given his willingness to let others take the microphone on an Atlas Sound project on these cuts, I can't help but go back to Cox's words on <i>Logos</i> before the album was released, which suggested that this was to be less introverted and that was ""not about me.""</p>
<p>And then I remember that the cover of the album consists of a photo of Cox with his shirt off and the lyrics in the first two songs start with the word ""I"", which suggests that we probably shouldn't take these statements very seriously. While the songs may or may not be ""about"" Cox in the strictest sense, the overall vibe is at least as introverted as 2008's <i>Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel</i>, and every note bears the same signature. With its strummed guitars, hushed double-tracked vocals, and tunes more reliant on ambiance and feel than melody or rhythm, <i>Logos</i> feels every bit as diaristic and personal, but with Cox, that's a plus. At this point, we're not looking to this guy for commentary on the outside world; we want to hear him wrestle with private demons in the sanctuary of his bedroom, bathing every sound in reverb to give the illusion of space and as a sonic balm against loneliness and figuring out how to make music as affecting as the stuff he loves to listen to.</p>
<p>So tracks like ""The Light That Failed"", ""An Orchid"", and ""My Halo"" (the latter two, though different in tone, are further entries in Cox's growing line of melancholy waltz-time shuffles) function primarily as the kind of eerie, blown-out mood music he has become very good at. They are amorphous sketches that still manage to convey feeling, capturing the sort of sad, exhausted, and fragile emotional state that is Cox's area of expertise. ""Shelia"", a taut pop song with a great chorus hook, is a change-up, though the repeating refrain ""No one wants to die alone"" fits with the rest of the record's themes. And ""Washington School"", with its dissonant chime of metallic percussion that sound like gamelan or evilly out-of-tune steel drums, contains the record's most interesting production, with thick drones reminiscent of Tim Hecker and menacing rhythm track.</p>
<p>So some things are different, some are the same, but all of it works well together. It's true that every time Cox ventures out of his comfort zone on <i>Logos</i>, you wish that he'd go even further and embrace extremes-- of tunefulness, tradition, noise-- that don't necessarily come to him naturally. He may yet take a big leap with Atlas Sound, but here the steps away, though rewarding, are tentative. For the rest of the record, <i>Logos</i> feels familiar and assuring, another affecting dispatch from a corner of indie music that is increasingly starting to seem like one Cox pretty much owns.</p></div>"|13619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13619-logos/|8.2|Mark Richardson

It's just a continuation of the Slits."" That's Ari Up, in a Pitchfork news interview, giving folks a hint on what to expect, or perhaps not expect, from <i>Trapped Animal</i>. Up also told us the Slits were adding dancehall to their burgeoning bag of tricks-- which is to say, some longtime fans who weathered the sea change between <i>Cut</i>'s punky reggae party and the murky dubbed-out <i>Return of the Giant Slits</i> might not be following Jamaican music and the Slits into the digital age.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, <i>Trapped Animal</i> is, for better or worse, a Slits album-- Mark E. Smith's quip about the Fall being the Fall even if it's just Smith and your granny on the bongos seems to apply here with Ari Up (assuming your granny exchanges her bongos for a melodica). The involvement of original bassist Tessa Pollitt helps make this record's claim to the group's name a little easier to swallow, but it's Ari Up who embodies the group's indomitable <i>je ne sais quoi</i>. And no matter how far these tunes may go astray from what folks recognize as ""Slits tradition,"" Ari does her best to bring these songs back into the fold.</p>
<p>Conveniently, the album provides fence-sitting listeners with a like-it-or-lump-it test right at the start. ""Ask Ma"" has Up and friends putting mothers on blast for doing a poor job raising their sons, and for making the Aris of the world have to put up with and clean up after these sorts of men, because even though moms have it tough (since men are keeping them down), ""who's to blame when we get messed-up men?"" If you know of any crypto-feminists desperate for their own ""I Am Woman"", point them in this direction. For your sake, I just hope they're not sticklers for quality rhymes-- the couplet that pairs up ""pick up the pieces"" with ""life's feces"" might be tough for even the most fervent acolyte to stomach. That the music behind such awkward and foggy notions is more than capable only makes these words tougher to bear.</p>
<p>This sort of musical/lyrical qualitative disjoint is all over <i>Trapped Animal</i>, with the latter half of the equation usually the guilty party. It's not so much that the album tries to tackle significant issues (like psychological trauma, or the Rastafarian view of Western culture), but that it's torn between actually tackling them head-on or simply playing a two-hand touch. A plodding go-nowhere tune like ""Issues"" suffers because of this indecision, and the less said about the didactic ""history lesson"" offered in the rootsy ""Babylon"", the better. More tunes with an honest sense of perspective, like ""Peer Pressure"", would've been welcome. It also helps that ""Peer Pressure"" features some of the playfulness that brings to mind fond memories of the group's good old days-- Up acts as her own one-woman jungle, acrobatically trilling and cooing as the rest of the group chants ""peer pressure!"" over and over like a playground taunt.</p>
<p>Tracks like ""Peer Pressure"" and ""Reject"" manage the difficult trick of being musically <i>Cut</i>ting without being warmed-over rehashes of past glories. Sadly, these are the exception more than the rule. The tunes on this record either take an admirable sentiment (like the call to follow your dreams and not the money in ""Pay Rent"") and mushmouth it into a strident polemic, or they just start eating their own foot the minute Ari opens her mouth. An unfortunate example of the latter is ""Reggae Gypsy"", which sounds as advertised, but makes that sound in the most obvious (read: worst) possible way. Of course, the album also includes ""Can't Relate"", a buoyant dubby tune that actually does right by the notion of gypsy-flavored reggae. It's buried on the far end of the album's back half with another highlight, ""Cry"", an unapologetic rock-steady ballad.</p>
<p>Given the confused beast that <i>Trapped Animal</i> turned out to be, it seems like the title track's focused on the wrong prisoner, that it's actually the band that's trapped, with the Slits' history and legacy acting as the gilded cage. Returning from nearly two decades of inactivity (barring one spotty EP and a handful of live shows) with a wide-ranging album that further expanded the definition of what the Slits were, while still maintaining fidelity to the infectious and creative fuck-all spirit that fueled the group during its heyday-- in other words, a true continuation-- would've been a welcome, and widely appreciated, statement. Instead, <i>Trapped Animal</i> is nothing more than an odds-and-sods record being passed off as ""business as usual"" by a band that doesn't seem to know what that business is anymore.</p></div>"|13598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13598-trapped-animal/|4.7|David Raposa

They wrote some songs in the spring, recorded in the summer, and released their debut in the fall. I'd make a joke about drummers always rushing the beat, but the resulting album, <i>Feel Good Together</i>, sounds remarkably fleshed out, full of smart, focused, propulsive indie art-rock sounds that sound both purposeful and adventuresome. Only one of the full-time drummers kept his day job: Greg Boyd of Ghostman &amp; Sandman sits behind the kit, pounding these songs into shape, and the Black Keys' Patrick Carney rounds out the rhythm section on bass. Steven Clements from the Six Parts Seven plays keyboards like he's opening for ELO; Teeth of the Hydra's Jamie Stillman plays lead guitar like he's been confined to the drum stool for far too long; and Jon Finley of Beaten Awake plays guitar and-- more crucially-- sings like he could have fronted a successful regional metal band 25 years ago.</p>
<p>Their shared background as drummers clearly informs the way they approach their new instruments, and <i>Feel Good Together</i> emphasizes fleet rhythms over ornate melodies. On the other hand, their experience in very different groups creates a mix of styles that range from 1970s post-Beatles pop to 90s post-rock to 00s Strokes-y bluster. Despite the band name, the album is a guitar-driven record, relying primarily on Stillman's dexterous fretwork to lead the quintet in and out of geometric jams that sound vaguely prog-metal in origin. He doesn't play lead so much as he pushes rhythm guitar to the forefront, which gives ""Good Golly"" its punishing momentum and ""Connect to Lounge"" its headlong menace. ""Buddy Scapes"" sets mathematical guitar and keyboard riffs against each other at a rapid gallop, as if a ridiculous tempo is as showy as a noodly solo. The pace rarely lags, but even when Drummer slow things down, they never sacrifice magnitude of sound. In fact, the stand-out here is ""Every Nineteen Minutes"", an austerely majestic anthem that ought to make a strong show closer.</p>
<p>That song arrives midway through the album, after the precision of Drummer's music threatens to sound a bit mechanical. But Finley's high, tensile vocals add a much-needed human element, especially when he strains to reach certain notes or convey a certain desperation. ""Mature Fantasy"" is his rawest moment, his voice going scratchy as he fights against the attack of guitars. At times the album feels crowded together, as Drummer juggle too many elements or cram songs too full of time changes and tempo switches. ""Summer Control"" in particular seems a bit formless as a closer, working in crunching guitars, quacking synths, and one too many change-ups. Generally, however, Drummer streamline these songs vigorously, as if they're trying to dispel every corny drummer joke all at once.</p></div>"|13599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13599-feel-good-together/|7.5|Stephen M.

For a guy who has found himself saddled with ""Next Dylan"" baggage and has enough personal tragedy-turned-backstory to potentially swallow his output, he's continued to hammer away at an increasingly sturdy songbook. Earlier this year, Perkins' second full-length, <i>Elvis Perkins in Dearland</i>, found him with a full band at his side, three other guys to propel further his voyages in mortality and universal (though highly personal) woe.<span> </span>Subject matter tended to veer stubbornly towards the dour, but the arrangements were bright, with each song wrapped in warm layers of true blue American sound.</p>
<p>Perhaps the record's strongest, no song better exemplifies Perkins' ear for the sublime as ""Doomsday"". It's a brassy, New Orleans-style processional that gains lift with every bass thump and sterling strum, Perkins admitting early on that, yeah, things got pretty grim back there and, yeah, it could stay that way, but screw it. ""I don't let doomsday bother me,"" he sings. ""Do you let it bother you?"" The song now bookends his new EP of the very same name. But to close, Perkins has refashioned ""Doomsday"" in its original incarnation as an equally soulful, yet much more somber gospel number.</p>
<p>The shift in mood works really well sonically, and it also fulfills a bit of listening requirement. This dessert release is a stand-alone six-song exercise in tinkering with the foundations of American music. ""Gypsy Davy"" is a folk standard that Perkins wires up and detonates just before the two-minute mark, adding some squall and the brand of gloom he's come to embody. On the bouncier side, ""Stay Zombie Stay"" is an undead love story you might have copped as a digital bonus track with the aforementioned full-length. Once a strummer, it's now a twangy shuffle as well as lead-in to ""Stop Drop Rock and Roll"", a by-the-numbers roadhouse shakedown that doesn't add much to the conversation even though it both rocks and rolls.</p>
<p>""Weeping Mary"" is truly luminescent, Perkins and his band riffing faithfully on the spiritual. It's not successful because it stirs but because it also showcases just how naturally and elegantly he and this band can sink their teeth into the forms in which they've been nesting. With the exception of the lone cover in ""Gypsy Davy"", Perkins has assembled a small sampling of songs here all with their own very healthy set of bones. And like its twin, the closing undressing of ""Doomsday"" makes for engaging and sumptuous listening. It's one of six looks back, on material both his and tradition's. But it's no step forward. Hopefully that day will come sooner rather than later.</p></div>"|13609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13609-doomsday-ep/|6.9|David Bevan

""East Mountain Joint"", the opening track on <i>Green Blues</i>, is a hypnotic hymn to unscheduled freedom, and it's catchy without losing the duo's loose, do-what-we-feel-like vibe. In fact, it's so entrancing that it's made subsequent work by Matt Valentine, Erika Elder, and their various colleagues seem like insufficient attempts to recapture that magic.</p>
<p>There have been beautiful close calls along the way, though, and <i>Barn Nova </i>might be the closest. Like <i>Green Blues</i>, it starts with the strongest material, the kind of songs that cohere without constricting. ""Feelin' Fine"" is like a skeletal version of ""East Mountain Joint"", with a steady shuffle that gives Valentine's ghostly moans a pulse. The swaying ""Get Right Church"" is even better. Here Elder's chants about journeys home and evening trains support a web of overlapping guitars, presumably belonging to Valentine and longtime producer/collaborator J Mascis.</p>
<p><i>Barn Nova </i>doesn't lack strong moments after those early gems, but it wanders too far to appeal to non-diehards. ""Summer Magic"" offers some nice looping guitar from Elder and Mascis, but runs out of ideas about halfway through, merely repeating them for another three minutes. MV &amp; EE's knack for slipping into lackadaisical Neil Young mode emerges on ""Wandering Nomad"", a pleasant, listless amble that's more like Lazy Horse than Crazy Horse.</p>
<p>The group floats fully out to sea on ""Bedroom Eyes"", which meanders for what feels like a lot longer than its 11-minute duration. I have a soft spot for this indulgent side of MV &amp; EE-- the side that would rather keep playing, stoned by their own sounds, than stop or change direction just because someone else might get bored. Anyone with similar inclinations-- fans of the lengthy psych of Bardo Pond, the noise jams of Fushitsushsa, the yawning drones of Pelt-- will admire their refusal to sacrifice peaks in order to avoid valleys. But I also doubt that someone with less tolerance would find much exciting about ""Bedroom Eyes"".</p>
<p>It would be wrong to make the same claim for the whole of <i>Barn Nova </i>though. It offers a decent amount of accessible folk-rock unencumbered by commercial concerns, and the idea of a perfect MV &amp; EE album is pretty much an oxymoron anyway. Better that they continue to float freely through space, shooting at stars of every size and occasionally connecting squarely with some big ones. This time around, their batting average is good enough that when the all-killer/no-filler MV &amp; EE box set comes along, at least a few tracks from <i>Barn Nova </i>will make the cut.</p></div>"|13608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13608-barn-nova/|6.3|Marc Masters

Looking back, remix collections have usually tended to draw on songs from multiple albums, whether we're talking about the Beatles' <i>Love</i>, Madonna's <i>You Can Dance</i>, or Blur's <i>Bustin' + Dronin'</i>. These days, everybody's pulling from the <i>Further Down the Spiral</i> playbook: Bloc Party have released not one, but two remixed versions of individual albums, LCD Soundsystem recently gave us <i>45:33 Remixes</i>, and Mariah Carey is already said to be working on a remixed version of her latest, <i>Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel</i>.</p>
<p>When you compile even the best remixes from one album, rather than an entire career, there's going to be more bloat. It's just inevitable.

""You know it's the same now: There are too many remixes! There's no time to hear them, technically in a lifetime.""</p>
<p>You could almost say the same thing about new Phoenix remixes alone. The French four-piece's triumphant 2009 album, <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</i>, has been helping drive HypeMachine traffic for months, in part because the group shared the instrumental ""stems"" for first single ""1901"" at the same time they posted the original mp3. (If that wasn't enough, the band has also streamed demos and acoustic tracks from the album.) So <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (Remix Collection)</i> was probably inevitable. Its source material is impeccable. Its remixers are Internet-nerd A-list. And a few of the remixes are actually pretty fucking good.</p>
<p>As an album, the digital-only <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (Remix Collection)</i> is also kind of frustratingly odd. I doubt even Sofia Coppola will feel the need to listen to the whole thing, straight through, very many times. As for DJs, you can probably guess from the fact that only one of the compilation's 15 tracks exceeds six minutes this isn't one of those remix CDs that makes all the originals more dance-friendly. Nor is it a remixed version of the entire album: The whole thing is built from only eight underlying songs. If you're listening at home, and you want to hear ""Fences"" five times in a little more than an hour, plus ""1901"" and ""Lisztomania"" a couple of times apiece, and you're tired of simply putting <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</i>'s first three tracks on repeat, then this is the album for you.</p>
<p>It's hard to stay annoyed with any of that, though, when so many of the individual tracks are so strong. Phoenix albums are typically (gloriously) front-loaded; this one feels back-loaded by comparison. Subtitled ""Deakin's Jam"", Animal Collective's take on the Tangerine Dream-y space-out of ""Love Like a Sunset"" deserves to be mentioned alongside both group's best efforts this year, drone-drowned and ecstatic. While the original ""Rome"" burns with white-hot cigarette-ash guitar distortion, a remix credited to ""Neighbours with Devendra Banhart"" fiddles (quite nicely) with piano and acoustic guitar, creating a gentle, atmospheric space for the loveless narrator to get his shit sorted out.</p>
<p>Other high-profile remixers' work here is consistently above-average, if rarely on par with the originals a lot of us pretty much know by heart by now. Passion Pit's ""1901 Bo Flex'd"" tweak goes deeper into John Hughes movies, with hugely romantic synths, but its clickety-clackety arrangement is disappointingly cluttered. Yacht does the farty bass thing with ""Armistice"", to so-so effect (when Mars sings, ""Look what you wasted,"" it sounds almost accusatory). San Diego ex-Muslims the Soft Pack steal the show with a scuzzy, garage-rocking quasi-cover of ""Fences"".</p>
<p>The rest of the compilation definitely won't blow your hair back like the first time you heard Phoenix, but it probably won't make you get up and adjust the iPod boombox, either. UK indie-dance trio Friendly Fires' piano-house remix of ""Fences"" could use a little personality, but it's a fine idea skillfully executed; same with Brooklyn dream-pop band Chairlift's haze-ification of the same track. Turzi's ""Love Like a Sunset"" has nothing on Deakin's jam, but the French five-piece do a decent job of raising the original's Krautrock-psych quotient. England's Alex Metric and France's Boombass offer up some pounding potential Ed Banger or Kitsuné material. Speaking of: Where's that dreamy ""Lisztomania"" remix by L.A. duo Classixx that appeared on <i>Kitsuné Maison 7</i>? Or that Don Diablo ""99 Fences"" Jay-Z mash-up? (OK, copyright law, got it.)</p>
<p><i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</i> has made Phoenix, deservingly, one of the year's biggest indie-rock success stories. They've appeared on ""Saturday Night Live"", sold more than 135,000 copies, and landed a spot in a widely viewed Cadillac commercial. If the album has anything to do with the battle between Phoenix's inner Mozart and the group's inner Franz Liszt, though-- referring to the 19th-century musician who gives ""Lisztomania"" its name-- then <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (Remix Collection)</i> has more in common with whichever one suffered a momentary lapse of editing skills. Your move, Mariah.</p></div>"|13576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13576-wolfgang-amadeus-phoenix-remix-collection/|6.0|Marc Hogan

Comparing the two careers directly probably isn't fair-- after all, it was the same quartet of Ian McCulloch, Will Sergeant, Les Pattinson, and Pete de Freitas that made those first five albums, whereas the reunion version never had de Freitas (he died in a motorcycle accident in 1989) and lost Pattinson after one album. Anyone who thinks bassists and drummers aren't important to the sound of a rock band could take a lesson there, as not having their old rhythm section has clearly made a difference.</p>
<p>Of course, age has too. Whether they were trying to keep up with the Britpop kids (1997's <i>Evergreen</i>), acting their middle age (1999's <i>What Are You Going to Do With Your Life?</i>), returning to their post-punk roots (2001's <i>Flowers</i>), or hitting the autopilot (2005's <i>Siberia</i>), it was always clear that the Bunnymen's second life was (no pun) a mere echo of their first. That autopilot they engaged on <i>Siberia</i> is still pretty well punched on <i>The Fountain</i>. McCulloch's always going to be a great singer, and Sergeant's always going to be a great guitarist with his own style, but the two have reached a point here where they seem to be cranking out these second-generation Bunnymen tunes in the way a Toyota Corolla factory cranks out cars. It's efficient and the quality is solid, but it's not that exciting either.</p>
<p>You do get a few aces, chief among them lead track and single ""I Think I Need It Too"", which has the classic sonorous McCulloch vocal, some liquid guitar leads from Sergeant, and a big, pumping chorus. ""Proxy"" is a pleasant surprise, going outside the band's usual box to scare up a piano-driven pop tune with breathy ""whoa-oh-oh"" backing vocals-- it's infectiously happy, not something you can say about many songs by this band, and if I were choosing, it'd be the next single. A good portion of the rest of the album basically photocopies ""I Think I Need It Too"", mining the same general sound for less return. ""Do You Know Who I Am?"" pairs a guitar part so melodically slight it makes little impression with a verse vocal consisting entirely of two-word phrases matching verbs with the word ""it."" The title track and ""Shroud of Turin"" are rote mid-tempo Bunnymen.</p>
<p>They get more mileage from the formula on ""Drivetime"", which has good backing vocals and more considered guitar leads, while ""Life of 1,000 Crimes"" distinguishes itself with a spry, stomping rhythm, some bells low in the mix and a nimble vocal from McCulloch. That's about 180 degrees from the dour, piano-dominated closer ""The Idolness of Gods"", where McCulloch sounds weary, perhaps lulled near sleep by the string synthesizer or his own down/ground/drowned rhyme scheme. The band's classic albums and best reunion discs (<i>Evergreen</i> and <i>Flowers</i>) have a cavernous darkness and intensity that McCulloch and Sergeant simply don't muster here. Ultimately, <i>The Fountain</i> is an echo of an echo, inessential to all but the band's most devoted followers.</p></div>"|13592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13592-the-fountain/|6.1|Joe Tangari

The first: Wanting nothing to do with the online hype typhoon attending Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's first album, he kills the band with a Difficult Second Album, 2007's <i>Some Loud Thunder</i>. <i> </i>The second, equally familiar way to frame the narrative comes from Ounsworth himself: ""If I want to do something with a particular group of people, I will. And if I don't, I won't. If people are willing to work on those terms, that's good. If not, I'll just have to figure out a different way."" Though I suspect his full story includes elements of both tropes, I'll give Ounsworth the benefit of the doubt-- at the least, it makes chapter two easier to understand.</p>
<p>This latest stage sees Ounsworth as an itinerant songwriter, recruiting collaborators to flesh out a heap of previously written material.<b> </b>On <i>Skin and Bones</i>, credited to Flashy Python and available only from <a href=""http://pythonspalace.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his website</a>, he hires all manner of Philly indie luminaries/friends (members of Dr. Dog, Mazarin, the Walkmen, and Man Man appear) to collaborate on a wheezy, dark song cycle-cum-inebriated stumble down South Street. <i>Mo Beauty</i>, released on Anti-, is more a proper solo album as we know these things, yet also recorded with significant help: at New Orleans' Piety St. studio, with a dozen or so local pros. Thus, two fresh plot-twists: <i>Bones</i> is druggy rock'n'roll so uniform in sound and sentiment it feels like a one-off concept album; <i>Beauty</i> is more variegated and takes more chances: Ounsworth showing his chops.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <i>Skin and Bones</i> is a sort of treatise on growing up and settling down while staying weird, cut with lamentations on the false consciousness of those who've chosen to follow the herd. The vibe is overwhelmingly woozy, with Wurlitzer and Hammond-laden arrangements spiked with jagged guitars and Ounsworth's instantly recognizable squawk, which more than ever evokes some anachronistic eccentric, twirling around a bar and liberally quoting Ezra Pound. On the title track, he bleats out a skewed requiem for life passing him by (""Nothing's wrong, the spaceship comes from inside!"") before crying out to his wife Emily to take him home. ""Cattle's New Clothes"" is spiked with pedal steel, as Ounsworth lays into an ex-undergrounder-turned-square (""Look at him go down with the businessmen cattle"").</p>
<p>Though it's possible to enjoy the atmosphere of <i>Bones</i> without worrying about lyrics, one does need a taste for murky and tipsy ambience.  Ounsworth gets fucked up straightaway on the opening track, a giddy, staggering thing held up by Toby Leaman and Matt Barrick's muscular rhythm section. He free-associates for a few minutes before the piece trails off with Billy Dufala's skronking saxophone coda, the musical equivalent of belching loudly while getting pushed out of the bar. ""Ichiban Blues"", a sour take on exotic travel, is the most straightforward song on the album, and cinema ode ""In the Darkness"" will satiate those looking for a return to the gangly new wave of the CYHSY stuff. Like those lost evenings we've all had, <i>Bones</i> is a good time while it lasts, but not necessarily something to return to all that often.</p>
<p>Ounsworth's likeness to David Byrne began with <i>CYHSY</i>'s still lovely ""Over and Over Again"", and the comparisons won't stop with <i>Mo Beauty</i>-- though for slightly different reasons. Where Byrne himself once decamped in the Big Easy to work with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band for the spare, stately score of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10870-the-knee-plays/""><i>Knee Plays</i></a>, Ounsworth went to New Orleans to hook up with former Meters bassist George Porter, Jr., keyboardist Robert Walter of the Greyboy Allstars, and a dozen or so others. ""I've romanticized that city's aesthetic since I visited there when I was 12,"" he told our news section last August. ""The music seems to just flow out of people naturally.""</p>
<p>The result of Ounsworth bottling this ""flow"" and working it into a set of songs is an album that showcases the breadth of his talents much more than the limited palettes of Flashy Python or CYHSY. Steve Berlin's crisp production highlights the collaborators' vibrant contributions while keeping Ounsworth front and center, resulting in a balanced, evocative work with a focus, appropriately enough, on place. Between the solemn, achingly pretty ballad ""Holy, Holy, Holy Moses (Song for New Orleans)"" and the jaunty, acoustic ""South Philadelphia (Drug Days)"", Ounsworth is able, like Byrne, to balance tics with songcraft, and play in opposite ends of the emotional spectrum (post-Katrina anomie, getting fucked up as a kid) with an aura of effortlessness. Elsewhere,<b> </b>""Idiots in the Rain"" brings the brass to bear on a tune about the exuberance of a French Quarter band revving up, and ""Bones in the Grave"" is a creaky, spooky bit that by itself explains the LPs release on Anti-.</p>
<p>Yet speaking about both records, Ounsworth told us that <i>Skin and Bones</i> was ""more about me trying to erect some grand statement,"" while <i>Mo Beauty</i> is ""going down to New Orleans for a short period of time and trying to piece something together based on a collection of mostly old songs."" Hmmm, okay. But one of these ""pieced-together old songs"" happens to be ""That Is Not My Home (After Bruegel)"", a set of vignettes each beginning with ""me and the wife,"" set to a wonderful blend of swoony new wave, punchy brass, and torrid string swells, which just might be the best song he's ever done.  That's one of the ironies of authorship, though: Too often, the author himself can be his own worst enemy when it comes to his own real-life narrative, dismissing his most inspired work in lieu of something which, for whatever reason, he finds himself closer to. For our sake (and his), let's hope he relegates future Flashy Python work to footnote status, and continues staking his persona on more adventurous projects.</p></div>"|13582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13582-skin-and-bones-mo-beauty/|6.5|Eric Harvey

Their aesthetic-- a sort of aboriginal futurism, where ceremonial rattles shake alongside misfiring machines-- involves each member improvising along esoterically personal paths. Everyone inhabits the solitary world of their little drum or shaker with catatonic intensity, and the music emerges in serendipitous exchanges between private black-outs. They don't mind trawling through tedium to get where they're going: Loops seem to be crafted by trial and error, until pockets of energy flare up in the deadening spaces. At their best, Excepter urge these spasms of life toward payoffs that feel all the more rewarding for their precariousness. But on <i>Black Beach</i>, they smudge the line between letting the magic happen and just nodding out.</p>
<p>""Castle Morro"" represents Excepter at their best. Dawn-of-man percussion and a hollowed-out bass pulse gradually merge, with organic rigor, into a mutant dance track, throbbing with unnatural life. But elsewhere, the album feels meager and under-imagined. Dedicating two out of five songs to lightly manipulated seaside recordings (""Pismo Pool"" and ""[Waves]"") is half-assed. ""Sand Dollar"" is soothing, with scattered taps and rustles amid sea-hush and a quiet flute theme, but never becomes more than pleasant. The 16-minute title track is more compelling, with a broad array of primitive instruments-- guiro, thumb piano, those metal egg-shaped bell-things, rattles, gongs, steel drums, tiny wind instruments-- divulging a rainbow of timbres. The problem is that <i>Black Beach</i>, as a pure listening experience, is a little too ""you had to be there.""</p>
<p>The record comes with an artily photographed making-of DVD, and if Pitchfork were a film site, the rating would be higher-- <i>Black Beach</i> works much better in visual format. Basically, Excepter rounded up a bunch of half-dressed fashion-hippies at Big Sur and had them zone out with hand instruments, playing against natural sounds instead of mechanical loops. In the video, the pieces gain important context-- ""Sand Dollar"" is for walking down cliffs toward a seductive shore; ""Castle Morro"" buries the sun. The famously stunning scenery does a lot for the music. And the title track is just a lot cooler when you know there's a naked guy jingling bells on a strip of scavenged seaweed, and a gong being gently struck with a live crab. As a video, <i>Black Beach</i> has a nice communing-with-nature spirit that we can connect with-- although it's like putting a price tag on a Big Sur sunset, or any experience that has mostly first-hand value.</p></div>"|13581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13581-black-beach/|5.8|Brian Howe

""Chicago is an October sort of city even in spring,"" Nelson Algren wrote, and <i>Geneva</i>'s an October sort of album no matter when you put it on. <i>Geneva</i> feels very much like the city its members hang their hats: rusty and steely and shifty, overcast and a little cold, and-- Algren again-- ""battle-colored."" It evokes a long early morning's drive down the length of any one of Chicago's city-spanning north-south thoroughfares, blowing through both industrial grit and beatific parkways, eyes peeled for crumbling facades and flashes of chrome and the not-so-occasional pothole.</p>
<p>There were signposts to <i>Geneva</i> all over the spiny, immediate <i>Enter</i> and last year's prettier, driftier <i>Station</i>, but on their third go, the Circles are clearing a path all for themselves. Debts are still due to genre godheads like Mogwai and Slint, for certain, but like the best work of their obvious forebears, on <i>Geneva</i> the Circles have found a way to make three guys in a room sound like a lot more than three guys in a room. Credit where credit's due: a great deal of <i>Geneva</i>'s success lies in the string work of cellist Allison Chesley and violinist Susan Voelz, who add a resonant depth to many of the record's best moments, filling in the gaps around these insistent compositions with a kind of sweeping gothic grime. But even without the hired hands, Russian Circles are penning limber, purpose-driven tunes, then playing the hell out of them. And, in their structure and execution both, this is doubtless their finest work yet.</p>
<p>Instrumental prowess is a double-edged sword in just about any genre, but when instrumental's all you do, you run the risk of the dreaded wank with every flick of the wrist. That's something the Circles in general and Brian Cook in particular have handled admirably through the years; they're capable of sneaking thunderous Lightning Bolt-style blastoffs and fingery Yngwie thingys in with opulent drift, while coming across as neither tossers or tossed-off. Drummer Dave Turncrantz gets plenty in, but favors the boom over the barrage, and guitarist Mike Sullivan, as Pitchfork's Cosmo Lee pointed out in his review of <i>Station</i>, often cedes the presumptive lead role for the good of the group. But it's Cook who's come into his own here on <i>Geneva</i>, consistently holding down the low end with inventive but unshowy aplomb. And when he's given a shot at the spotlight-- a position he takes only a handful of times throughout-- the record is his.</p>
<p>The Circles have long done peaks far better than valleys, and there's really only one such dip on <i>Geneva</i>: ""Hexed All"", a tune they all but give over to Chesley and Voelz, flipping the melee of, well, ""Melee"" for a supine string-laden swoon. It's clearly meant as a respite from the relative brutality that surrounds it-- much like the first few minutes of ""Verses"" was to the middle of <i>Station</i>-- but it also works against the album's momentum a touch, the widescreen beauty of Explosions in the Sky reformatted to fit your screen. It's fine, but it's not necessary; the string section is so seamlessly integrated into the Circles' sound on meatier tracks like ""Fathom"", putting them front and center feels more like a conciliatory gesture than a Russian Circles tune.</p>
<p>The record's second half favors an enveloping crumble over the opening trio's crushing hypnotism; tracks unfurl more patiently, perhaps more gracefully, but with nearly the same sense of purpose that underlies the weightier start-up. Save the proggy ""Malko"", this stuff is textbook post-rock; songs start soft and slow, more elements get thrown into the mix, and we eventually have our climax. Still, there's a sense of internal dynamics in the tunes that makes this particularly good textbook post-rock; instead of a simple gradual increase in volume, they pull in sounds from left-field, lending the tunes a ratchety, rust-covered feeling that is unusually complex. Nearly all of these tunes die screaming, they just take a bit longer to get there as <i>Geneva</i> goes on. It's more a matter of contrast than anything else; were the running order reversed, you'd sit on your hands through the first half waiting for the impending blowout. I suppose this, too, is like Chicago, with the livelier South Side giving way to the statelier North, both with their unique merits. Either way, <i>Geneva</i>'s a record with dirt underneath its fingernails and resolute urgency at its heart, and like the place from which it hails, it's worth the bluster.</p></div>"|13607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13607-geneva/|7.8|Paul Thompson

Fair may it be to argue that Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie's Kiwi hipster-doofus schtick had outworn its welcome (the dubious return of Bret's ""Rap Dancin'"" crew-neck sweatshirt might be all the proof needed there), the faux-folk duo found themselves backed by better writing, more screen time for all those increasingly brilliant auxiliary characters, and, in some respects, better songs. If for nothing else, it's well worth the price of the DVD for the pleasure of having the timeless image of a baffled Jemaine confronted by an identically dressed Art Garfunkel permanently seared onto your frontal lobe.</p>
<p>But about those songs. Like their self-titled debut, <i>I Told You I Was Freaky </i>collects the musical focal point(s) from each episode, presented untouched and sold as an album. Unlike the debut, which effortlessly presented itself as a straight-up comedy record that succeeded independently of the accompanying television program, <i>Freaky</i> sort of only works as a soundtrack, slave to the mutual exclusivity of its visual counterpoint. So even the fact that most of the songs here are funnier, more varied, and in most cases more tuneful and catchy than their predecessors, most of the payoff is tied to whether or not you're able to reenact in your head the very same imprudent predicament featured on the screen.</p>
<p>For example, there's the falsetto-laden ""We're Both in Love With a Sexy Lady"", a spot-on send-up of R. Kelly and Usher's ""Same Girl"". While the idea may seem pitch-perfect, the song has an awful lot to do with the particulars of the episode where both Jemaine and Bret fall hard for a girl with an epileptic dog. If you're already on board, the song's still great fun-- if not, it's simply a plot-tie set to music. Though I seriously doubt there will be more than a couple of people out there picking up this record without having seen ""Flight of the Conchords"", it's difficult to fully enjoy something that so critically hinges on external specifics. So even in rare cases where songs fall flat, like the Police-baiting ""You Don't Have to Be a Prostitute"" or ""Angels"", you don't even have the memory of Jemaine hooking in too-short-shorts to pad them with. It's almost as if those geniuses at HBO are trying to boost DVD sales or something...</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are plenty of tracks here that require no memory-jogging to enjoy, from the crunk-tweaked ""Sugalumps"" (a clever inversion of ""My Humps"") to the trashy B-more club bounce of ""Too Many Dicks (On the Dancefloor)"" (see a theme emerging here?). In fact, quite a few of these cuts come dangerously close to seamlessly adapting to the, ahem, goof-less Hot 100 landscape, where both Trey Songz's excellent ode to sexting, ""LOL :-)"", and LMFAO's confoundingly idiotic ""I'm in Miami Bitch"" remain comfortably seated. It's no joke that there's real talent at work here: The joke-y new-wave synth exercise ""Fashion is Danger"" is too generically silly to leave a mark, but even the filler content-- ""I'm the edge, I'm the chic, I'm the taste/ I'm larger than life with just a hint of lace""-- has enough bite to resonate with the shrewdest of Lady Gaga fans. Much like with the show, if the big idea keels over, you can expect a million little baby ideas to come spilling out, each one more charming than the last.</p>
<p>But the separation anxiety that <i>Freaky</i> induces is its unfortunate undoing, though we can least be glad that someone had the good sense not to include dialogue interludes for context's sake. Call it a noble sacrifice for the good of the series, but one that ultimately leaves the album looking a little too much like a party favor long after the credits have rolled. It might be a lot to ask, but hopefully one day our heroes might get around to recording a comedy album proper, show or no show. In that case, we'll be right here. Or as Murray would say, ""present.""</p></div>"|13570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13570-i-told-you-i-was-freaky/|6.7|Zach Kelly

A good No. 2 doesn't need to be less interesting than the star-- Flavor Flav is surely a more magnetic figure than Chuck D, for example-- but at best, they establish a necessary contrast that casts the lead in sharper relief. The star shines brighter, the subtext runs deeper, and the emotional range gets broader. In indie rock terms, think of how Kim Deal's easy-going stoner femininity emphasizes Black Francis' tightly-wound nerd masculinity, or the way Lee Renaldo's hipster everyman style offsets the larger-than-life personae of Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon.</p>
<p>Pavement may not have had a vocal dynamic as profound as Public Enemy, the Pixies, or Sonic Youth, but Stephen Malkmus had his appropriate foil in the form of Scott ""Spiral Stairs"" Kannberg. Spiral was no less shambling and inscrutable, but he was very good at playing the self-effacing underdog to Malkmus' nonchalant indie alpha male. It would be an error to label his songs as more ""sincere""-- he was consistently a far more cryptic and opaque lyricist than SM-- but he was capable of projecting a nervous vulnerability that destabilized the freakishly self-assured vibe of Pavement's first four albums in a way that was positive and necessary. Even if Spiral Stairs was not crucial to either Pavement's appeal or Malkmus' success, his presence offered a subtle balance and contrast, and yielded at least a few classics: ""Kennel District"" from <i>Wowee Zowee</i>; ""Date With Ikea"" from <i>Brighten the Corners</i>.</p>
<p>In the time since Pavement's dissolution in 1999, Kannberg has stepped into the role of the frontman with mixed results. Despite the nod to George Harrison's <i>All Things Must Pass</i> in its title, his debut as the leader of the Preston School of Industry did not reveal him to be an extraordinary songwriter obscured by the flash of his former partner, but rather just a serviceable author of amiable but not especially interesting indie rock. He pushed himself further by embracing alt-country on the follow-up, <i>Monsoon</i>, but the record was a tuneless, dreary mess, and it is undoubtedly the worst release ever to be associated with anyone having to do with Pavement. The central problem with the Preston School of Industry albums is that the very things that made Kannberg an effective foil for Malkmus also made him exhausting and dull as the focal point of a band. Whereas he was once the Milhouse Van Houten to Malkmus' Bart Simpson, he had devolved into being an incoherent indie equivalent of Milhouse's dad mewling ""Can I Borrow a Feeling?""</p>
<p>After a five-year hiatus from recording, Kannberg has dissolved the Preston School of Industry, or perhaps more accurately, rebranded the project as Spiral Stairs. This is a sensible decision. Preston School of Industry was a terrible name for a band, and Spiral Stairs was always one of the better stage names in alt-rock. The reversion to the Stairs moniker could be taken as a signal that Kannberg has returned to form, but anyone expecting anything along the lines of his Pavement tunes will be let down by the contents of <i>The Real Feel</i>, his first record under the name.</p>
<p>Kannberg's new music mostly takes its cues from Neil Young and mid-period Bob Dylan, and to a certain extent, the ragged yet expansive sound suits his strengths as a guitarist and his weaknesses as an often aggravatingly nasal vocalist. ""True Love"", the album opener, is confident and sharp despite feeling more than a bit generic, and tracks like ""Maltese T"" and ""Cold Change"" are minor works, yet successful on their own terms. Even the weakest cuts on <i>The Real Feel</i> are at least passable genre exercises, but at a point it becomes difficult to tell whether they are actually good faux-Neil Young songs, or if these tunes would have any appeal at all to listeners who were not hardcore Pavement fans with an unusually large amount of goodwill for the band's less famous founding member.</p>
<p>Though he is still prone to writing nonsense lyrics nearly devoid of resonance, Kannberg has opened up significantly as a lyricist, though his most emotional and unguarded moments on ""Call the Ceasefire"" and ""Blood Money"" are mostly quite banal. Unlike many of his previous works, he seems far more interested in revealing himself and connecting with an audience, but even though his voice has grown stronger, he still sings everything as if he can't stand to make eye contact with you. The music is a clear step up from his nadir on <i>Monsoon</i>, but it's only a lateral move in terms of quality compared to the first two Preston School releases. His style may shift, but Kannberg remains an unambitious songwriter and underwhelming frontman. It could just be that he's the type of person who best thrives as a second banana. Then again, maybe all he needs is a foil of his own.</p></div>"|13547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13547-the-real-feel/|5.2|Matthew Perpetua

(Yeah, <i>in elementary school</i>-- he was a pretty weird dude.) The fact that Doseone is still sucking air contradicts his theory. The motor-mouthed rapper would have used up any reasonable allotment after Themselves' 1999 debut, <i>Them</i>, and he's continued to vent his glossomania with Subtle, cLOUDDEAD, 13 &amp; God, and other projects over the ensuing decade. But maybe my teacher was right, and this is just a ""deal with the devil"" situation, where Dose traded any prospect of mainstream success for a bottomless bag of language, an unmistakable nasal whine to distinguish his voice, and an unnatural capacity for rapid-fire enunciation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Dose was a founding member of experimental hip-hop collective Anticon, and like many of his peers, his relationship to rap has grown more abstract over the years. <i>Them </i>was a very strange record, with tweaky, minimal beats (by the other half of Themselves, Jel) that showcased Dose's verbal arsenal: rhymes so tightly clustered that ""internal"" doesn't do them justice; protean timbres and cadences; sound effects, whispers, giggles, funny accents. But for all of its spoken-wordy set pieces and surreal imagery, it was undeniably a rap record, rooted in rhymes-and-breaks fundamentals. The same cannot be said of much work by Dose's other groups, where sung vocals, electro-pop, and post-rock have at least as much traction as hip-hop.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With <i>CrownsDown</i>, their first album since 2002's indescribable <i>The No Music</i>, Themselves take up the rap-saving talking points upon which Anticon was founded in a major way, with a strong conservative slant to their science fiction. It's a back-to-basics album from a group who probably needs one, having ventured so far afield. Opening track ""Back II Burn"" is probably the closest Dose will ever come to ""Mama Said Knock You Out"", a pugilistic comeback with snarled boasts and victorious synth stabs. Jel's live MPC jam on ""Skinning the Drum"" catches up classic breaks like ""Apache"" and ""Cold Sweat"". Only ""You Ain't It"" takes a page from modern rap, with Auto-Tuned singing by Subtle's Dax Pierson. (And even that could arguably be called a nod to electro.) Most of the album is a direct homage to the aggressive, cluttered productions of the Bomb Squad and the splashy electro of Afrika Bambaataa, with Dose's flow keyed to the repetitive rhyme schemes of the old school, amid lots of turntable scratches and tick-tick-boom. Content-wise, it's about as easy to summarize as a volume of the Encyclopedia Britannica, but rest assured that it liberally treats all of the following topics: wack MCs, style-biters, cultural decline, social injustice, and the worst scourge of all, bootleggers. <span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Of course, for these guys, ""back-to-basics"" is relative. ""Oversleeping"" is full of clangorous machine noise, which clears up when Dose spits photon streams into the microphone. ""Deadcatclear II"", a sort of enigmatic confessional, surfs on wobbly drones and drum hits that spill out static like scatter bombs. ""Roman Is as Roman Does"" is like Melle Mel meets TV on the Radio, if TVOTR were heavily influenced by Alvin and the Chipmunks. The clash of hoary hip-hop tropes and future-jacking excursions creates a discordant feeling; it's like reading a novel with every fifth word translated into Martian. The record is so crammed with bizarre details, and so relentless in its full-frontal attack, that it verges on being indigestible. Themselves, whose platform surely includes anathema for instant gratification, probably wouldn't have it any other way. I prefer the more minimal style of <i>Them</i>, which was sharply critical-- and deeply personal-- without being hectoring or bombastic. But listeners who enjoy picking apart seam-bursting sonic worlds will find plenty to explore here.</p></div>"|13596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13596-crownsdown/|6.7|Brian Howe

Did you know that? I have to admit I did not. The words ""Zero 7"" probably hadn't popped into my head for nigh on five years, around the time I last worked in a record store. I remember the duo's music (specifically 2004's <i>When It Falls</i>) making a good fallback when someone complained that Franz Ferdinand was a little too abrasive, Zero 7 being the downtempo act with the gall to debut well after the fad had peaked. Hey, it was that kinda store.</p>
<p>Zero 7 would probably like you to know that <i>Yeah Ghost</i> is some sort of omnivorous post-MP3 pop record, <i>not</i> downtempo. Zero 7 was probably better off identifying <i>Yeah Ghost</i> as downtempo, a genre where it's practically impossible to limbo under where the bar's been set for what constitutes ""interesting music."" Even your voracious consumer of vacuous VH1-style adult-alternative would still have to listen reeeeeeeally hard to find anything remotely exceptional about <i>Yeah Ghost</i>. The rest of us are S.O.L.</p>
<p><i>Yeah Ghost</i> is one of those albums where it sounds like the band happened on a bargain sale for just-past-expiration fads and a few genuinely necrotic oldies. It's easy to feel generous when you've bought garbage cheap and in bulk. No <i>Ghost</i> track gets by on one bad idea when Zero 7 can give us two or three.</p>
<p>So ""Mr McGee"" treats us to some horrorshow mix of vaguely post-Amy Winehouse, generically sassy R&amp;B vocals and a cod-glam/Marc Bolan beat that was at least marginally interesting when Goldfrapp swiped it from German techno six years ago.  (""Medicine Man"" more or less repeats the exact same formula without a hint of shame.) ""Swing"" is the sort of winsome nuevo twee-pop that turned the <i>Juno</i> soundtrack into a glorified ATM for its compilers, shoved through overly glossy George Martin pastiche that dangerously ups the saccharine level. ""Everything Up (Zizou)"" is low-impact dance-rock with every possible edge shorn off. ""Sleeper"" is the bad blog-house remix of rock band <i>du jour</i>. (I hear the Gossip, yr mileage may vary.) And the overall vibe is: Every 2000s trendlet must go!</p>
<p>All these reheated ideas wouldn't be so <i>bad</i> in the aggregate if the band attacked the material with the slightest verve, rather than the pop-slumming loop-heads they come off as here. The whole thing's like Basement Jaxx for the undemanding: all of the sonically-overstuffed, cross-genre shtick, none of the energy, wit, or timeliness that makes the Jaxx (or at least <i>old</i> Jaxx) more than channel-hopping thieves. About the only time <i>Yeah Ghost</i> comes to life is on the sleepy drift of ""Ghost SYMbOL"" (admittedly about one vocal sample from being a straight Burial jack) and ""Solastalgia"" (ditto, but maybe Fennesz for Banana Republic in-store play?), which at least proves Zero 7's instincts for make-weight downtempo haven't deserted them.</p>
<p>So wait, I hear you asking, it's slightly unclear: Is <i>Yeah Ghost</i> any good? You know, as art? Well, the cover's pretty. But as music, whether pop or downtempo or lukewarm filler for marking the hours until death? Okay, it's not really very good at all. But it's there nonetheless. If you happen to work in one of the country's few remaining record stores, it will probably prove useful in placating those who don't want to be harassed by Lady Gaga as they browse. Sadly I may be among them.</p></div>"|13601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13601-yeah-ghost/|4.0|Jess Harvell

On his latest LP, <i>At the Cut</i>, he is staring mortality in the eye, taking on existential themes with a pile of cultural references, and still working his mind around the nearly fatal accident that left him paraplegic on the verge of adulthood in 1983.</p>
<p>As on 2007's <i>North Star Deserter</i>, Chesnutt is here joined by members of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Thee Silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra, as well as Fugazi's Guy Picciotto. Together they build a sound that walks a line between country-folk, Southern soul, and post-rock, which works because the music's uncertainty about its identity often mirrors Chesnutt's own doubt. Opener ""Coward"" deals in dread and aggression with its crawling tempo and doom-laden, harmonized guitar outbursts. When Chesnutt's ragged voice shreds the phrase, ""I am a coward,"" in a long, agonized shout, it's not an admission-- it's a threat. It's frightening, bombastic, and a bit messy, and it's a good announcement for an intermittently foreboding album that occasionally drags a bit.</p>
<p>The title of ""It Is What It Is"" adopts an annoying phrase as a pathway to Chesnutt's accepting not only his own flaws and inconsistencies but also whatever comes after death. The song references Victor Hugo, Shakespeare, Kafka, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Henry Darger, and W.H. Auden, and culminates in a wickedly incisive rejection of religion (""I don't need stone altars to help me hedge my bet against the looming blackness""). Not every track has quite so much to say-- the lyrics of ""Philip Guston"" are quite minimal, serving as a bit of seasoning for a broken-down violin and guitar jam, while the affecting closer, ""Granny"", is built around a simple, quiet reminiscence about Chesnutt's grandmother making pimiento cheese at the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>There are a couple of welcome leavening moments-- the bright organ and Leslie cabinet guitar of ""Concord Country Jubilee"" chief among them-- but <i>At the Cut</i> is foremost a dark album, and about as far tonally and sonically as Chesnutt has been from 2003's highly polished <i>Silver Lake</i>. The restraint of the musicians involved leaves Chesnutt's fragility at the center of the music and lends the album an air of refinement and wisdom that could have easily been drowned out by guitarists more eager to call attention to themselves.</p></div>"|13520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13520-at-the-cut/|7.2|Joe Tangari

Onstage, it was an audiovisual three-ring circus, with 16-millimeter video screening images of the roadway while costumed female hula hoopers gyrated in the foreground. Now, he has packaged the experience in a boxed set, complete with an essay in the liner notes, the DVD, a comic book, and a View-Master reel. On one hand, this is exactly the sort of quixotically huge undertaking Stevens has a weakness for. And yet, once you strip away the bells and whistles, <i>The</i> <i>BQE</i> is essentially a traditional 40-minute orchestral suite, a lightweight showpiece in which the ghosts of Gershwin, Ravel, Respighi, and other standard-orchestra-repertoire crowd-pleasers surface. In fact, until an electronic interlude crashes in about halfway through, <i>The BQ</i><i>E</i> could easily pass for the sort of palette-cleanser that might have opened a major orchestra's subscription concert in the 1950s.</p>
<p>The fact that Stevens would devote his energy to something as unwieldy and time-consuming as an old-fashioned orchestral suite while his fans wait patiently for an <i>Illinois</i> followup is perversely endearing, like learning that J.J. Abrams has put the final season of ""Lost""<i> </i>on hold so he can realize his dream of reciting<i> The Iliad</i>. But luckily, <i>The BQE</i> isn't much in need of the polar-bear-on-tricycle-style praise that greeted Elvis Costello when critics learned that he wrote his <i>Il Sogno</i> ballet suite by hand: ""Look, it's a pop musician, and he's <i>composing</i>!"" <i>The BQE </i>is a bubbly, fun, fast-paced, and deftly written piece, full of compositional fireworks, jazzy interludes, and stylistic detours.</p>
<p>It opens in full faux-pompous mode, trumpets blaring and woodwinds fluttering, before dissolving into a languid Romantic episode, the pillowy string writing and dewy, twinkling piano recalling Rachmaninov at his drowsiest. From there, Stevens flits through a dozen different moods and textures, a rustling-leaves pizzicato section collapsing directly into a kaleidoscopic, double-time electronic version of itself. The variations come and go breathlessly, each folding into the next without much attempt to locate the connective tissue linking them. The effect is superficial, but pleasantly bracing, like flipping quickly through the pages of a book.</p>
<p>The accompanying DVD, which Stevens shot himself alongside cinematographer Reuben Kleiner, is supposed to drive home the connection the work has with this project's famously clogged namesake. However, instead of animating or complementing the bustling music, the visuals bog down the project. The split-screen shots of the highway have a very staid, Ken Burns quality to them, and feel as though they could have been produced completely independently of Stevens' music. If Stevens was setting out to evoke the odd exhilaration of urban chaos-- and he seems to have been, rhapsodizing in the liner notes about the roadway's ""steep grades, sharp turns, [and] detours... [creating] a rollercoaster obstacle course for the unsuspecting driver""-- then it's ironic that the video he's produced is completely devoid of kinetic energy. Long, motionless shots of the congestion on the BQE don't give you much of a fresh perspective on traffic; they mostly feel like, well, sitting in actual traffic. When the sun sets and we're invited to gaze upon lit-up city skylines and red suns, it's a relief, mainly because we're no longer stuck in gridlock.</p>
<p>As with <i>Run Rabbit Run</i>, Osso's recent string-quartet reworking of Stevens' second album, <i>Enjoy Your Rabbit</i>, it's tough to know for whom <i>The BQE</i> project is intended. It seems doubtful that the work will find a second life in orchestral programs, and it feels equally unlikely that fans of any of his previous albums will be clamoring to hear this work live. As such, <i>The BQE</i> is probably best classified as an unusually successful vanity project, as well as evidence of Stevens' restless creativity. However, even at the close of the Brooklyn Academy of Music premiere, Stevens came out to sing some songs; one hopes that he gets back to singing and writing some more of those soon enough.</p></div>"|13593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13593-the-bqe/|7.4|Jayson Greene

At the end of every decade, she puts out a greatest-hits set: 1990's <i> The Immaculate Collection</i> was the kind of perfect straight-into-orbit  retrospective pop artists dream of achieving, and if 2001's <i>GHV2</i> felt a little less epochal, it still collected a lot of magnificently  melancholic dance songs from the following decade. Since then, she's  fallen off a bit-- which is a strange way to describe eight years in  which she's recorded a dozen #1 dance singles, but ""Hung Up""  is really the only song from the post-<i>GHV2</i> period that's lodged  in the American pop consciousness.</p>
<p>What Madonna is ostensibly  selling here-- the ""celebration,"" with its echo of her first  hit, 1983's ""Holiday""-- is 26 years of being Madonna, which  does get a big gold star. (The chronological 47-video DVD version of <i> Celebration</i> is a lot closer to the mark: A lot of the fun of her  career has always been its visual side.) But what she's actually selling  is an album, made for repeated listening, and that's a trickier proposition.  The 2xCD edition collects roughly half her singles, including everything  on <i>Immaculate</i> except ""Rescue Me"". For its first 12 minutes or so, it's incredibly strong-- the opening sequence of ""Hung  Up"" into ""Music"" into ""Vogue"" is a convincing  argument for her genius.</p>
<p>Then the sequencing turns random  or even unfortunate. Following that opening salvo with the pallid ""4  Minutes"" kills the first disc's momentum. Beginning the second  disc with eight pre-1988 tracks can't help but suggest that she peaked  earlier than she actually did, and the ""Take a Bow""/""Live  to Tell"" pair that follows a little later drags it into ballad  purgatory. Putting ""Erotica"" next to ""Justify My Love""   has the peculiar effect of suggesting that sex was just something Madonna  was interested in briefly (and following them with a new one in which  she sings, ""My sex is a killer/ Do you wanna die happy?"" sours  them in retrospect). And the title track (the other new one), a <i>pro  forma</i> trance collaboration with Paul Oakenfold, comes off as less celebratory  than obligatory: where the new songs on <i>Immaculate</i> pointed Madonna's  way forward for the next decade, these just sound like throwaways.</p>
<p>One critical line on Madonna  was once that she was merely a trend-jumper, an appropriator of subcultural  and dance-musical developments that she treated like so many berries  ripe for the plucking. As it turns out, that's exactly what's made her  special in the long term: Behind that not-quite-lovely bleat and the  image she manages as carefully and transparently as, say, Cindy Sherman,  her chief weapon is an unbelievably dead-on sense for what sounds and  styles and sexualities are ready for the big time, and a sensibility  that lets her spin four minutes of pleasure or melancholy out of anything.  The Madonna singles that hold up best over time, though (""Ray of  Light"", ""Papa Don't Preach"", ""Don't Tell Me"",  ""Secret""), aren't just celebrations or ballads; they've got  a sense of sadness or gravity that's illuminated by the glimmering light  of the disco ball. There's a lot of remarkable music on <i>Celebration</i>-- the  work of an artist who's spent a quarter-century in a passionate body-lock  with the question of what exactly makes pop music popular. She deserves  a retrospective more interesting than this haphazard piece of contract-filling  product.</p></div>"|13590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13590-celebration/|5.7|Douglas Wolk

No, wait, Leslie Feist did. It's been an eventful five years since the Norwegian duo's previous album, <i>Riot on an Empty Street,</i> featured the Canadian songstress on two tracks. After Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambæk Bøe's recent New York show, that a surprise Feist guest appearance got top media billing underscores just how eventful. Sorry, guys, I guess royalty isn't what it used to be.</p>
<p>No longer does <i>Quiet Is the New Loud</i>, the title of Øye and Bøe's 2001 Astralwerks debut, sound like such an appealing mantra. The hushed politeness that Kings of Convenience and, earlier, Belle and Sebastian reintroduced to indie listeners around the turn of the millennium must've lost its fresh feeling somewhere between Natalie Portman big-upping the Shins and the Decemberists doing a prog-folk rock opera. Then there's the more than 400,000 copies <i>Riot</i> sold in Europe, a number that looks virtually impossible for a group of such modest stature today. Throw in Øye's two mostly solid albums fronting dance-poppers the Whitest Boy Alive, and, well, what do Kings of Convenience have left to say?</p>
<p>""Quieter is the new quiet,"" apparently. Despite calls for the whisper-folk pair to make Øye's house and techno background more apparent, <i>Declaration of Dependence</i> doubles down on hushed Scandinavian understatement. No drums, unless you count slapped fretboards or squeaking fingers: just two voices, two acoustic guitars, and occasional cello, viola, or one-finger piano plinks. Along with sharper songwriting focus, this go-for-broke softness makes for the most durable, rewarding Kings of Convenience album yet-- a <i>Pink Moon</i> to past efforts' <i>Five Leaves Left</i>. Barring a last-minute José González surprise, it's also probably the best new full-length of its style you'll hear this year.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Declaration of Dependence</i> reveal everyday tensions with a cool, undemonstrative reserve. You can hear the spare but descriptive verses as about romance, the band itself, or global politics, depending on your preference. Where <i>Riot</i> opener ""Homesick"" offered the suggestive image of ""two soft voices blended in perfection,"" the new album's first track, tender ""24-25"", declares, ""What we build is bigger than the sum of two."" Slowly shuffling ""Renegade"" uses bold, vivid brush strokes to carry out that old maxim, ""If you love something, let it go""; ""Why are you whispering when the bombs are falling?"" a solitary voice asks, between slightly dissonant strums. ""Riot on an Empty Street"", a holdover since years before the album of that same name, finds a traveling singer lost for words, but not for delicate melodies.</p>
<p>Rather than become more electronic, Kings of Convenience here choose simply to apply dance music's minimalism and sense of texture more fully to their chosen acoustic-pop form. Bittersweet single ""Mrs. Cold"" has been compared to Jack Johnson, probably because both use percussive hand slapping, but the popular surfer-turned-singer has never recorded anything so perfectly poised, so deceptively depressing; a ringing lead guitar line repeats like a looped sample. ""Boat Behind"", a single in other countries, floats a melancholy violin line over a tangled tale about reuniting with someone but never belonging to them, sounding almost like another lost Arthur Russell demo. ""Rule My World"", which follows Sweden's González into forceful denunciations of theocratic zealotry, has the bouncy upswing of French house. Øye's smoky falsetto fills in for the absent Feist on songs like ""Freedom and Its Owner"".  ""Power of Not Knowing"" neatly echoes Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ""April Come She Will"".</p>
<p>Both halves of the duo now live back home in Bergen, Norway, after a multi-year absence by the Whitest Boy Alive singer. Whether inspired by lovers, each other, or the warmongers of the world, Kings of Convenience's latest is ultimately just what its title says: a bold and beautiful assertion that we are better off together than apart. Or, as ""My Ship Isn't Pretty"" wonderfully puts it: a series of ""quiet protests against loneliness."" If the album cover had you expecting 2009's umpteenth nu-Balearic cruise, be glad we got this eloquent message in a bottle instead.</p></div>"|13553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13553-declaration-of-dependence/|7.9|Marc Hogan

The Dirty Projectors decorate Dave Longstreth's Sahara-informed guitar leaps-of-technique with harmonies more rhythmically complex than most delivered on this side of rock in a long time, and Animal Collective continue to pile polyrhythms and tribal chants into skewed pop oddities. Akron/Family's burrowed further into funk than ever before, and a whole fleet of rock bands are currently situated much closer to primal blues than they are to the pasty likes of Pavement. Hell, even Monsters of Folk opened their debut with a stunning soul number about faith and doubt and god and love. And last weekend, Frere-Jones himself interviewed Justin Vernon-- a Wisconsin cracker who sings more than a little like Bill Withers with a falsetto-- for the high-society New Yorker Festival. Tough year in the biz, as they say.</p>
<p>Thing is, none of these developments-- and the above examples represent only the obvious-- are <i>responses</i> to Jones' argument. They've been around longer than that essay, ""A Paler Shade of White"". Jones simply tossed a handful of the moment's indie stars into a sea of nostalgia and hindsight, refusing to dig beyond the big bands for the (correct) fear that they'd quickly send him back to The Sketchbook of Theses. Indeed, one of the year's best counters to Jones' argument comes from Karl Blau, a prolific, curious, and mostly overlooked songwriter, producer, and instrumentalist who splits his time between Anacortes and Olympia, Wash., and K Records and Knw-Yr-Own. His latest, <i>Zebra,</i> is his ode to the African music he treasures and the music it prompted stateside. Importantly though, Blau integrates these styles into his approach, refusing to forsake his own shambling, inclusive ways to rock and folk to make some self-important, Afro-centric statement. These influences have been in his music all along. Hearing them just required a bit of attention.</p>
<p>""I've been somewhat obsessed with lots of music from Africa and music made by descendants of Africa over the last dozen years (and really my whole life),"" writes Blau, another hirsute white dude who looks a bit like a lumberjack. ""Last winter I decided to start a collection of songs recorded at Dub Narcotic in Olympia that would pay my respects to influences of African people and people of African heritage.""</p>
<p>If you're familiar with Blau's oeuvre, this move shouldn't come as a surprise. Several years ago, he began the Kelp Lunacy Advanced Plagiarism Society, through which he'd release songs of all stripes every month or so. The series eventually stretched to 28 discs. Or consider <i>Beneath Waves</i>, his excellent K debut in 2006: Opener ""Crashing Waves"" is a would-be folk-rock anthem for Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy fans, and ""Shadow"" feels like Bill Callahan mocking Lou Reed. But with syncopation that won't sit still and horn charts that erupt in fits and starts, ""My Johnny"" suggests a brass band in art school. ""Into the Nada"" is, at its core, a highlife celebration, its throbbing bass, slithering guitars, and skittering drums presaging <i>Zebra</i>'s intentions.</p>
<p>Again, that's what's most satisfying about <i>Zebra</i>. Though it's Blau's ""Africa album,"" it seems, in the end, mostly like another Karl Blau record. That's not meant to deride his lack of commitment to any sound as much as it is to note the intricacy and variety of his catalog. Certainly, on <i>Zebra</i>, dub lessons stretch the melody and scatter the tones on ""Tha' Ole Moon Smile"". The infectious, clever ""Dark Sedan"" recalls the lo-fi set trying to grapple with a Prince infatuation (which means it sounds a little like the Blow). ""Crucial Contact"" conjures the acid washes of psychedelic soul, and ""Apology to Pollinateaurs"" suggests the humid funk of New Orleans woven into Aston Barrett's beard. ""Nothing New"", with its bone-dry guitar tone and serial riff, even feels like a Group Doueh meditation that's been cut from beneath by the sorts of jarring chords McCoy Tyner often played. But these songs-- quixotic, personal reflections with intriguing little details-- remain Blau's.</p>
<p>That said, missteps and a few songs that aren't very memorable line <i>Zebra</i>. Blau played nearly everything himself here, and though he's an excellent musician on several instruments (his bass playing is fantastic), Blau occasionally overreaches his abilities: ""Free the Bird"" stumbles into a mess of Kurt Cobain vocal clichés, and Blau fumbles a few rhythm shifts. The mix of refracted guitar and tweaked synthesizer on ""Goodbye Little Song"" feels hesitant. But again, that's Blau's whole thing. On the humble <i>Zebra</i>, he highlights one chunk of his interests without letting it override the others. And, as always for him, that means offering a few songs that could stand to be reconsidered. Blau does what he's always done, just adding an extra beat, a washed-out tone, or thicker bass. It's a darker shade of white that-- sorry, Mr. Jones-- thankfully feels unaffected and fitting.</p></div>"|13591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13591-zebra/|7.2|Grayson Currin

If you've seen him perform live as White Rainbow, then you know this to be true: A typical set features Forkner alone, kneeling on stage amidst of a mess of instrumentation-- guitars, pedals, synths-- that he uses to build ambient washes and vocal-looped drones on the spot. Listening to previous records like 2007's <i>Prism of Eternal Now</i> and taking into consideration his background in jazz, one assumes he works much the same way in the studio-- letting the music develop organically.</p>
<p>Rather than turning toward more pop-oriented structures with his latest release, <i>New Clouds</i>, Forkner has indulged this spontaneous approach even further, resulting in a heady record that, while at times uneven, features some of his most compelling music yet. The album is presented like a long-form jazz or modern-classical piece, with four extended tracks (roughly 16 minutes each) that comprise one continuous movement. (Sounds arduous, I know, but it's ultimately more blissout than high-concept challenging.) It's the sort of thing that's best absorbed as a whole-- there's a general sense of moving forward through shifts in mood and momentum-- and, despite its very unplanned, impressionistic feel, mostly manages not to veer too far off course or, worse, into New Age-y background-music territory.</p>
<p>The record's best songs (heck, ""jams"" might even be more accurate) are its first and last, which bookend the album with an energy that's less present during its middle section. Opener ""Tuesday Rollers and Strollers"" takes form over whirring electrical noises and looped, tribal-like chants before introducing skittering synths and a heavy drumbeat as it progresses. It's a fuller and more dynamic sound than Forkner was able to achieve on <i>Prism of Eternal Now</i>'s shorter cuts (the longer track lengths here seem justified in that sense) and conjures ELO prog as much as it does the Field's vocal-spliced propulsion. ""Monday Boogies Forward Forever"", the finale, is sort of a blossoming drone that worms reverberant guitar notes through clattering background percussion and opens into a seductive coda.</p>
<p>The tracks sandwiched between these two, ""Major Spillage"" and ""All the Boogies in the World"", are considerably slower-paced. They shift the momentum downward, drawing more on ambient textures and delicate features like hand-drum pitter-patter and acoustic guitar strumming. It's this stretch that might test the patience of those without an appetite for loose free-jamming, and you could reasonably call it a lull, but on some level it works as a calming period after the disorientating opener and sets the stage to close the record with a bang. If you're able to view it through that lens, then <i>New Clouds</i> has much to offer as an unscripted, decidedly un-pop kind of album: mood music and drug music, yes, but more than that, the uncompromising work of a dude making sounds strictly on his own terms.</p></div>"|13594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13594-new-clouds/|7.0|Joe Colly

Ask a fan for a description and you'll likely hear more about what they do-- play loud, fast, and insanely repetitive-- than how they sound. Not so long ago ""loud and fast"" meant punk, but now those words could just as easily mean noise, prog, metal, grunge, lo-fi, even techno. Lightning Bolt's chugging riffs, splattering beats, and amplified overload contain all those styles. Often the only difference between their songs is which label fits a little more than the others.</p>
<p>Measured with that ruler, <i>Earthly Delights</i> is Lightning Bolt's metal album. We're talking degrees here-- the duo of bassist Brian Gibson and drummer Brian Chippendale still prioritize speed and volume over genre. But overall, most tracks center around the kind of growling chords and monolithic beats metal is built on. Even the more amorphous songs have a distinct gravitational pull. And as with the best metal, the simple pound can be kinda catchy, driving into your brain until it's stuck there.</p>
<p>In other words, <i>Earthly Delights</i> is no grand departure. But drastic change wouldn't fit this band. The whole point of their music is hypnotic repetition, magical moments sprouting from endless reiterations. They could stretch out further, but they'd likely lose access to those mini-epiphanies. Besides, there are enough bands rejecting their pasts in the name of diversity. Lightning Bolt are happy to grind out an eternal present, and few can dig deep into a moment quite like them.</p>
<p>This time around the duo's musical shovel seems larger, heavier, a bit more able to move earth. Gibson's riffs in particular shoot straight for the gut. He's less enamored of noodly high-end runs-- though he doesn't abandon them-- and more interested in cramming thick chords into Chippendale's frantic beats. The brutal churn of opener ""Sound Guardians"" sounds like a pile of sped-up Motörhead albums. ""Nation of Boar"" is all low-end stomp, the kind you can imagine the duo flopping some newly-grown hair to.  Even on ""Funny Farm"", about half of which is a trebly loop, they become invigorated when they shift back into heavy chug.</p>
<p><i>Earthly Delights </i>isn't all metal slam. The swinging ""Colossus"" is practically a ballad; ""Flooded Chamber"" busts ears with whines and abrasions; and the most intriguing track, ""S.O.S."", evokes the darkest noise-rock moments of Japanese bands like Fushitsusha and Gerogerigegege.  Throughout, Chippendale's humming vocal lines are sneakily melodic, perhaps a product of similar explorations he's done recently with his solo project Black Pus.</p>
<p>Still, of all the Lightning Bolt albums so far, this is the one most likely to wear you out with unrelenting heaviness and elongated mega-jamming. Appropriately enough, the album ends with its longest track, the 12-minute endurance test ""Transmissionary"". By the end whatever fatigue you feel could either be the satisfaction of a hard workout or the strain of a tedious task. But it probably doesn't matter to Lightning Bolt-- they're more concerned with testing their own limits than yours, and <i>Earthly Delights </i>shows their career is less a series of sprints than one exhilarating marathon.</p></div>"|13577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13577-earthly-delights/|7.6|Marc Masters

On a weight bench, most famously, in his brother's garage, with a chord organ and a boombox microphone. This was back before his bipolar disorder really exploded on him, well and truly seized into his life. A lot of that music is hard to separate from the way you hear it-- the tape hiss and the vulnerable voice, the excitement of hearing into someone else's strange, pretty world, straight from boombox to boombox.</p>
<p>And then a lot of his most vital music has also been recorded by other people entirely: a whole raft of covers by musicians who listened to those spare weight-bench sketches, heard a ton going on inside them, and wanted to play them big-- wanted to take the sketch and turn it into a big painting or a full-color animation. In between, well, it's been dicey: Attempts to make Johnston himself mesh with collaborators and backing bands and expensive studios haven't always gone well. How do you make the big colorful painting when the private sketch is right in the center of the canvas? Often they both lose out.</p>
<p>The biggest, greatest news about <i>Is and Always Was</i> is that it does it right, beautifully and unawkwardly-- something that, if I were producer/musician Jason Falkner, I might be prouder of than having played with Paul McCartney. The record avoids the old mistake of thinking that Johnston is a ""weird"" musician and therefore needs a weird backing, or that he's a ""raw"" musician and needs a scrappy one: Johnston writes pop songs and loves the Beatles, and on this record he gets the rich Beatlesque pop arrangements that are surely in his head. They even find a sweet spot between forcing too much personality into the instruments (and having them overwhelm Johnston) and not putting in enough (so that he sounds like he's singing karaoke); sometimes a little bland or obvious, but in a good spot. This is as much as I've ever heard Johnston sound not like an individual, not like someone who's being supported, but like the lead singer of an actual band, one he's really part of-- a great, strange, and ambitious psychedelic band. Even amid the grand, triumphant rock pomp of the closing number, Johnston sounds like he's really, genuinely <i>in it</i>.</p>
<p>It's a happy result that should bring even more cheer to Johnston fans than the news, reported recently in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>, that he has a new cat. Better still is that his songs here shine and charm in a very comfortable way. Johnston doesn't sound so vulnerable; he sounds strong. ""High Horse"", another of those songs about the girl he fell for 30 years ago-- the Ur-girl of all Johnston songs-- pairs a supremely confident melody with a bouncy arrangement that's really, really difficult not to smile at. ""Queenie the Doggie"" has him sounding reassuringly strong, too, eulogizing a pet over a vaguely Hawaiian shuffle. There's successful Johnston <i>rock</i>-- a re-recording of ""I Had Lost My Mind"" with big guitars arcing all around it, a pastiche of the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" (""Lost in My Infinite Memory""), songs with big dramatic dynamics that Johnston matches nicely. There's a punky little gem called ""Freedom"", and one called ""Fake Records of Rock and Roll"" that's like Johnston's equivalent of Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock and Roll""-- except, based on one interview quote, I think it might actually be about when you buy a cheapo release of some classic thing and it turns out to be a lame re-recording.</p>
<p>Johnston devotees will get a kick out of it, for sure-- out of the successful merging of Johnston and a rich, full-band aesthetic, and just out of the sound of Johnston doing well and writing well, finally rocking out on the wide screen he's usually had to imagine. What's funny is that this might <i>not</i> make it a good spot for Johnston newcomers to start. This, strangely enough, seems like one artist where it might be better to hear the lonely, private stuff first, to see the sketch before you see the attempt to paint it large.</p></div>"|13589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13589-is-and-always-was/|7.1|Nitsuh Abebe

Sad-eyed Swede Sarah Assbring already has one under her belt, if you count 2005 Scandinavian release <i>Look! It's El Perro Del Mar!</i> (later refashioned with a slightly different tracklisting in the UK and North America as the self-titled <i>El Perro Del Mar</i>). But that's the thing about break-ups and, by extension, break-up records: At the time each feels like a cataclysm to end all cataclysms, the definitive statement on cessation. Yet in light of the next one-- and, God help us, chances are there will be a next one-- all the ones before can seem quaint, trite, overblown, and anything but definitive. So it makes sense that Assbring should craft another ode to getting over it, just as it makes a certain sad kind of sense that the gal who sang of being sad all day long (and thinking about being sad all night long) and suggested loneliness can be pretty would again find herself in a position to make such a record. Refreshingly, <i>Love Is Not Pop</i> does indeed make what came before it seem quaint, representing a significant maturation for El Perro Del Mar both in sonics and sentiments. If <i>Look!</i>/<i> El Perro Del Mar</i> was Assbring rebounding from a failed high school romance to the tune of a candy bender and the familiar, comforting sounds of 1960s pop music, <i>Love</i> documents a more complicated, post-collegiate parting of ways against the more sophisticated sounds of late nights and dancefloors, courtesy of co-producer (and Studio half) Rasmus Hägg.</p>
<p>For one thing, she initiates this one. ""I've got something to tell you,"" Assbring begins over gentle acoustic strums and rays of synth sunshine on <i>Love</i> opener ""Gotta Get Smart"". ""Don't wanna make you sad."" Of course what she has to say will do just that, but like many an El Perro Del Mar song, this one adorns its lyrical miseries in only the most uplifting of arrangements. When much of the mix drops out to let Assbring deliver the kicker-- ""It hurts now but deep down inside/ We both know it's better to part than live in a lie""-- she sounds like the patron saint of mercy, and when a chorus of multi-tracked vocals arrives to invite us to ""Go on, go on, go on,"" it's as if they're leading us to the promised land. Getting dumped never sounded better. From there it's on to piano-and-groove album highlight ""Change of Heart"" and the dubbed-out midnight excursion ""L Is for Love"", its echoes suggesting the infinity of a night spent teasing apart those great questions of life and love in search of an elemental clarity. ""Love isn't anything,"" the chorus would seem to mock here. Least of all pop?</p>
<p>Yet El Perro's brand of pop is certainly easy <i>to</i> love, and a cozy sort of organic warmth-- characterized by thick, resonant drums and keys, and treated guitars that seem to lurch and lumber with the slightly irregular rhythms of real life-- pervades the new record. You're just as likely to swing your hips here as to curl up with the headphones on and rock yourself to sleep. Indeed, some tracks encourage both: just as ""Heavenly Arms"" threatens to carry the listener off to Nod, the beat gets reborn in double time, complete with handclaps that make for the most welcome alarm call ever. ""It Is Something (To Have Wept)"", meanwhile, hearkens directly back to the organ-saturated devotional hymns of El Perro's previous record, <i>From the Valley to the Stars</i>-- that is, until Assbring and Hägg blast the chapel straight into the stratosphere with a little bit of rhythm and a lot of production pyrotechnics. They really could have ended the record right there, but instead we get an epilogue of sorts, ""A Better Love"", wherein Assbring cuts to the very heart of the <i>other</i> thing about breakups: namely that the loves that come in between them (how's that for glass-half-empty thinking?) only tend to get, yes, better and better. ""You deserve a better love than me,"" is Assbring's ultimate admission, and with that the break-up cycle-- as viewed from the unique point of view of the enacting party-- is complete. Whatever love is or isn't, who needs it when you've got records like this one?</p></div>"|13571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13571-love-is-not-pop/|7.8|Matthew Solarski

KRS' gun-talk credentials are straight, but he's spent most of the past two decades in uplifting political rant mode; Buck has specialized in snarling, guttural street shit since day one. KRS raps in an overactive, splenetic blurt, like he can't bear to sit down for more than a minute; Buck's one of the best ever at the ominous, low-key simmer. Back in Boogie Down Productions' prime, KRS had a regular habit of bashing old associates, whereas Buck has been with the same crew of rappers, the Boot Camp Clik, for his entire career. KRS is pretty tall; Buck is almost unbelievably short. I could go on. And yet, here they are, with a collaborative album, for some reason. Welcome to rap's inexplicable 2009.</p>
<p>Actually, there's a decent reason for the team-up. KRS recently signed to Boot Camp's home label, Duck Down, presumably because it's one of the only places where purist NY hip hop still gets a push. And for Buck, it's an opportunity to do a record with one of NY rap's great institutions. Honestly, it's not like either of them really had a whole lot else going on. So here we go: an album of obstinate hardhead traditionalism that makes Slaughterhouse sound like Kid Cudi.</p>
<p>KRS has spent the past decade or so kicking frantic absurdities (remember the Nelly feud?), and his music has suffered, so the hope was that Buckshot's tough, direct consistency might help bring him back down to earth. No such luck. In fact, the opposite might be true. KRS is still raring to drop nonsensical science on the masses: ""Hip hop is a new urban faculty/ A function of the collective mental anatomy."" And instead of sticking with boxcutter talk, Buck has his own dubious moments, like where he calls himself the ""dot-com don."" Even a normally impeccable guest like Pharoahe Monch can't help but succumb to the awkwardness: ""You only get one shot, get it? One shot. Meaning half of both of their names.""</p>
<p>A pretty impressive range of guests show up on <i>Survival Skills</i>: Mary J. Blige, Bounty Killer, Slug, Talib Kweli, an Obama-bashing Immortal Technique. But the album is so tied to its goofy concepts that not many of them get a chance to make much of an impression. K'Naan, for example, gets to make his big appearance on the vaguely hectoring wise-old-man song ""Think of All the Things"", which awkwardly interpolates Harry Chapin's ""Cats in the Cradle"", of all things. The verses on ""Hear No Evil"" are based around the respective ideas of seeing and hearing (lots of third-eye stuff), which does not work at all. ""We Made It"" is a supremely wince-worthy would-be inspirational track, on which KRS congratulates you, over and over, for being alive. And even though they've enlisted a fairly impressive roster of producers like Black Milk and Nottz, it doesn't much matter when KRS basically ignores all his backing tracks.</p>
<p><i>Survival Skills</i> isn't without its charms. After all, countless of these guys' contemporaries have dropped off the map completely, so in a way it's inspirational to see them soldiering through their own bad ideas and diminished returns. If you're in the right mood, KRS' rabid bark can get adrenaline going no matter what he's saying, and the intentions are noble. (After all, when was the last time you heard an anti-Auto-Tune jam where someone admonished you to ""go online, look up Kraftwerk""?) Says KRS: ""Critics say you want us to chill; you old now/ But really, that ain't how I feel; I'm more bold now."" Well, no, he's not, not really. But if these guys want to keep making diminishing-return records, they've earned it. We just don't necessarily have to hear it. To catch a glimpse of these guys' past glories in 2009, your best option is still to go see them live; this is just a souvenir.</p></div>"|13578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13578-survival-skills/|3.9|Tom Breihan

It was around that time when I became familiar with the Long Island band's major-label debut, a record that wasn't shy about positioning itself in that easily licensed Jeff Buckley-Snow Patrol continuum-- as far as sudsy melodrama goes, it was intermittently enjoyable, but it also had a kind of Johnny-come-lately vibe.</p>
<p>To their credit, lead singer Dan Nigro tones down the cheap seats act to a good extent on <i>You Can't Take It With You</i>, and As Tall As Lions are trying to incorporate relatively artier influences. But it's ambitious in the way memorizing all the world capitals is: It's the kind of busybody accrual that you really never have to make good on. It's where the eight-minute ""epic"" is called ""Duermete"" instead of ""Fall Asleep"" despite having not one word of Spanish in its lyrics.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are plenty of points where As Tall As Lions identify what made <i>other </i>albums great, and you can pick out where they're seeking inspiration. ""Circles"" comes off like a Cliffs Notes <i>In Rainbows</i>, jumbling the beat fake-outs of ""15 Step"", a winding acoustic motif reminiscent of ""Jigsaw Falling Into Place"", and the computerized percussion of ""Videotape"". Predictably, it's a complete fucking mess of forced syncopation and aimless melody which only rights itself when ATAL settles into a straightforward 4/4 chorus that leads up to a baldfaced attempt at Jonny Greenwood's dissonant solos. ""Sixes &amp; Sevens"" barges in ass-first with choral vocals and a time signature too complex for its acoustic strumming. The title track works in slightly Oriental accents to its harps and keys before climaxing in a chorus whose unctuous sheen might perk the ears of Mutt Lange's attorneys. You know these guys have been listening to New Orleans blues because the rank gumbo of ""We's Been Waitin'"" uses one of those telephone-box vocal effects. A quarter of ""Duermete"" is taken up by droning ambiance.  Nearly everything else has some sort of backmasking effect, unorthodox percussion, and enough guitar processing effects to rival a Fennesz record-- it's overstuffed with pretty much everything except memorable hooks.</p>
<p>As overblown as <i>You Can't Take It With You </i>is musically, Nigro's not one to be upstaged by guitar pedals. Throughout, he associates falsetto with passion and cliché for truth-- ""Sixes and Sevens"" works in ""I've been hung out to dry"" and ""wake me when its over""; what might be an otherwise exhilarating, cracking-whip rhythmic workout (""In Case Of Rapture"") is actually bested in terms of Cold War Kids-aspiring uplift cliché-- ""It's better to die on your feet than live down on your knees."" It's not their fault that Passion Pit already wrote a better song with the same title about the same thing, but if whoever's dying to the sounds of ""Sleepyhead"" pulls through, I hope they tell Izzie and McSteamy that life's too short for lyrics like ""the rhythm of your heart beeps loud until it stops and robs the room of sound.""</p>
<p>I can't front: I actually like <i>You Can't Take It With You </i>more than I probably should if only because it's got such a narrow revivalist charm. It's reminiscent of that very specific span of time between 1997 and 1999 when the likes of Better Than Ezra, Days of the New, Our Lady Peace, and Live had absolutely no idea how to cope in the post-<i>OK Computer </i>world and stuffed their also-ran post-grunge with drum machines and talked mad shit about the ""electronica"" influence on their new futuristic concept album. If I didn't know any better, I'd swear I bought this thing at my college bookstore at a reduced New Artist price on the strength of a couple of three-and-a-half-star reviews praising its ""eclecticism,"" only to later sell it for beer money. But you can't really blame As Tall As Lions for going overboard on the studio wizardry: There really isn't too much here that sounds like the work of a couple guys jamming out in a room, but then again I doubt this would be much better if it did. Hell, cue the strings.</p></div>"|13584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13584-you-cant-take-it-with-you/|4.4|Ian Cohen

Dizzee's embrace of success and fame has directly coincided with his actual accrual of both, and if <i>Maths + English</i> tentatively sought to establish him as a globetrotting good-life playboy, <i>Tongue N' Cheek </i>takes that guise to its logical extreme.</p>
<p>At first glance, <i>Tongue N' Cheek </i>would appear to be Dizzee's slightest work-- 11 tracks, about 40 minutes, self-released, silly title, sillier cover. Not to mention the combination of producer one-offs (go ahead and find another album with both Shy FX and Tiësto), been-around-the-block singles, and ""did they clear that?"" samples that could make it come off like a placeholding mixtape. But whatever romantic vision one might have of his days of ringtone-influenced scavenger sounds, you can't forget that his work on Basement Jaxx's ""Lucky Star"" remains every bit of a high point in his early career: He sounds damn good over trashy, flashy electro that manages to keep pace with cadences as hyperactive as his own, and, above all, he's way more fun than he's often given credit for.</p>
<p>""Bonkers"" exhibits a deferential Dizzee offering a single, cyclical verse to serve as backdrop for Armand Van Helden's wildly distorted bass rips and drum rolls. ""Road Rage"" achieves a similar success-- despite the easy read that some form of mental illness informs the first two tracks on <i>Tongue</i>, they come off more like a celebration of instability. Tempo is key, though-- when saddled with Calvin Harris' straight-laced H&amp;M disco, one feels more inclined to wiggle into a pair of designer jeans than to shake one's ass (see ""Dance Wiv Me"", ""Holiday"").</p>
<p>What makes Dizzee such a pleasure to hear is not so much his <i>rhymes </i>that continue to be a selling point, so much as his point of view, which still manages to convey a down-to-earth wisdom. ""Can't Tek No More"" and ""Dirtee Cash"" might be initially notable for their source material (Aswad and the Adventures of Stevie V, respectively), but even as Dizzee threatens to get too vague with the big picture, he always finds a way to stay grounded-- on the former, he empathizes with a blueballed boomerang kid taking strange club pills to counter the numbing effect of living with his parents, while the latter comes off like a hi-NRG advert for fiscal responsibility. Call it contradictory that ""Dirtee Cash"" is immediately followed by ""Money, Money"", but even that sounds kinda reasonable as far as straight-up baller lyrics go: Dizzee boasts about having a <i>mortgage </i>before he turned 22, which naturally rhymes with ""blowing me like a didgeridoo.""</p>
<p>For all its strengths, <i>Maths + English </i>tended to fare most poorly when Dizzee tried to meet other, barely related stars (Lily Allen, UGK) on their own terms.  He's every bit as self-sufficient as he was <i>Boy in Da Corner</i>, but at this point, he's nowhere near as lonely. Or at least not trying to be-- it's hard to call self-explanatory party rhymes like ""Dance Wiv Me"" and ""Freaky Freaky"" morally praiseworthy (sample lyric: ""spray in her mouth and watch her kiss boyfriend""), but it's in the same vein as the pungent horndogging of <i>Showtime</i>'s ""Girls"", in that viewing women as objects of desire instead of predatory succubi can be something along the lines of progress.</p>
<p>Which makes ""Chillin Wiv Da Man Dem"" something of a departure. Musically, a sample of the Floaters' coke-hazed ""Float On"" skirts the cheeseball soul style of <i>Operation:</i> <i>Doomsday</i> (in a good way), but it's a homebound tribute to the simple pleasures of male companionship. It's actually kinda quaint that he can still kick a verse about the politics of <i>Pro Evolution Soccer</i> etiquette and all-night bull sessions, even if the track itself needlessly ends with ""fuck these bitches, I'm keepin' it real.""</p>
<p>Amongst other things, ""Leisure"" is a catch-all boast about Dizzee's natural charisma, an ability to see beyond armchair moralizing and taking other rappers to task for being unable to do the same. But as he repeats, ""I make it look <i>easy</i>,"" it might just be a riposte to those who might see <i>Tongue N' Cheek </i>as a minor inclusion in his catalog, a quickie that won't make year-end lists like <i>Boy </i>and <i>Showtime </i>or break new ground for him as a cultural polymath like <i>Maths + English.</i> Yet if this is the kind of album he can effortlessly churn out at his leisure, we're in for a promising second decade of the man's work.</p></div>"|13573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13573-tongue-n-cheek/|7.5|Ian Cohen

That was roughly the case with the first volume of the <i>Dillanthology </i>series, one of those technically good but still somewhat redundantly inessential compilations whose omissions defined it just as much as its inclusions. And that problem was easily solved by the rarities-packed <i>Volume 2</i>, which did its part by containing a whole bunch of unreleased remixes that were actually worth unearthing.</p>
<p>With the knock on Jay Dee new jacks being that they came to his stuff only through his early-mid-2000s releases, a <i>Volume 3</i> weighing heavily on that material seems even more pointless. Most of <i>Dillanthology 3</i> is sourced from four albums from this decade-- <i>Welcome 2 Detroit</i>, <i>Donuts</i>, <i>The Shining</i>, and the recent summer release <i>Jay Stay Paid-- </i>as well as a track from the <i>Ruff Draft </i>EP and a couple of Jaylib's Dilla-produced selections from the Madlib beat-trading collaboration <i>Champion Sound</i>. And make no mistake, they're all good tracks from great albums. But they're great albums that the vast majority of people with at least a passing interest in Dilla already own at least one of.</p>
<p>Odds have it that the album in question would be <i>Donuts</i>, his final, sprawling sample-collage work and one of the most definitive recent examples of albums that really work best as a whole. If there's one piece of work that shouldn't be broken up into component tracks and sprinkled across a collection of other stuff, it's that one: ""WorkinOnIt"" (which opens the compilation) and ""Anti-American Graffiti"" jump out like non-sequitirs without the surrounding context of their album and get abruptly cut off with a couple of added seconds of post-track silence tacked on at the end. It feels like watching a YouTube clip of half of a dialogue scene in a feature film and then being expected to recognize how great the movie is.</p>
<p>Granted, there are only two dismembered pieces of <i>Donuts </i>on <i>Dillanthology 3</i>, with Dilla's more single-friendly albums taking up the bulk of the tracklisting. And there's a good cross-section of music that runs a pretty wide gamut of his production techniques over the last six or so years of his life: glimmering keyboard-drenched soul (<i>The Shining</i>'s lush Common/D'Angelo feature ""So Far to Go"" and the Isley'd out ""Won't Do""), ultra-taut funk (ranging from <i>Welcome 2 Detroit </i>track ""It's Like That"" to <i>Jay Stay Paid</i>'s ""Glamour Sho75 [09]""), blown-out psychedelia (<i>Ruff Draft EP </i>highlight ""Nothing Like This"") and manic jeep beats (Jaylib cuts ""Raw Shit"" and ""The Red""). If this compilation has a real purpose, it does so by acting as a condensed proof that Dilla's career post-majors was stylistically liberating in a way, even as it ensured that his transition to the underground vanguard was a natural one.</p>
<p>But what will buying and owning this collection actually mean to the uninitiated once they finally realize how vast Dilla's career was? <i>Dillanthology 3 </i>is an adequate primer, but a transitory one; the music on here should be plenty to convert the unconverted, but not enough to monopolize their attention once they realize just how start-to-finish great the albums these tracks came from actually are. A good solution would have been to extend this compilation past its paltry 47 minutes, get these tracks (including the <i>Donuts </i>selections) to flow and segue into each other, make a genuine mixtape out of it. Maybe then it could've brought some new context to some familiar tracks-- instead, it just leaves everyone who listens wanting more.</p></div>"|13562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13562-dillanthology-3/|5.5|Nate Patrin

That album was lively but not light, an especially exuberant celebration of newfound musical possibilities. By contrast, her follow-up is the post-party comedown, a collection of hard-learned lessons about love, sex, and human connection. <i>Know Better Learn Faster</i> is a more mature record, slightly disillusioned with the world, but no less playful and with no less personality.</p>
<p>She and her backing band the Get Down Stay Down certainly live up to this album title: <i>Know Better Learn Faster</i> sports a fuller sound with more pop tricks and trickier arrangements that incorporate swirling Philip Glass-y keyboards on ""Burn You Up"" and Pavement slackness on ""Good Bye Good Luck"". New Orleans horns punctuate the imperative ""Cool Yourself"", and the shape-shifting ""The Give"" pairs her banjo with low guitar notes that draw out the distress in her lyrics. The band's energy rarely flags; instead the guitars grow only more manic and urgent as the album progresses. Vocally, Thao throws herself into the giddy pop of the title track and ""When We Swam"" with an abandon that contrasts nicely with the confessed uncertainties of ""But What of the Strangers"". On ""Body"" she plays the neglected woman with a wounded anger, questioning a distant bedmate while sounding a bit like <i>Ghost of a Dog</i>-era Edie Brickell-- no pan.</p>
<p>""Everybody please put your clothes back on,"" she commands on the loose, jangly ""Trouble Was For"". The things people do with their clothes off weigh heavily on her mind throughout the album, which is sure to generate unfairly prurient interest. She's no Liz Phair, though. Thao may be demanding, but she's never crude. ""Bring your hips to me,"" she sings repeatedly and flirtatiously on ""When We Swam"". She can be desperate but never plays the victim. ""What I am, just a body in your bed?"" she accuses on ""Body"", before turning that the question in on itself: ""Won't you reach for the body in your bed?"" These physical details and pointed demands pop out of the songs, evoking a situation rather than describing it outright, in much the same way Lucinda Williams uses geographical details or Will Sheff breaks the fourth wall.</p>
<p><i>Know Better Learn Faster</i> is an album of doomed relationships and what Thao calls ""sad sex,"" and she comes across as a chronicler of a scene, reporting from a circle of friends and acquaintances-- perhaps the same ones who shout the choruses of ""Good Bye Good Luck"". That communal perspective is crucial to making this album sound much more extroverted than its predecessor. Projecting outward, she conveys a warm exuberance that keeps the music spry despite the weighty subject matter. Or, as she intones by way of introducing the boogie-shoegazer finale ""Easy"": ""Sad people dance, too.""</p></div>"|13583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13583-know-better-learn-faster/|7.8|Stephen M.

""Slaraffenland"" is something of a state of mind, too. The word is apparently Scandinavian for ""land of milk and honey,"" and while the Danish band of the same name is hardly all sunshine, it is indeed something of a world unto itself-- a vision of musical synthesis that borrows from any number of influences and constructs those raw materials into something new.</p>
<p>Admittedly, that describes countless other style-blender bands. What sets Slaraffenland apart is the way the collective tends to avoid easy discord and dissonance and assembles often-disjointed pieces into something downright serene, even peaceful. <i>We're on Your Side</i>, the group's third album, falls on the less rigid end of the chamber-pop spectrum-- downbeat but not dour, reveling in the sweet spot between structure and open-ended art-rock exploration.</p>
<p>Put in more specific terms, the album sounds like Brian Eno fronting a more pastoral National, the familiar despondent tone and gentle melodrama of the latter intact, but the vocals a measured hum of collective call and response and warm intonation. To this Slaraffenland add unpredictable (but not distracting) percussion, mournful (but not brash) brass, and several striking but subtle embellishments ringing, swooshing, droning, and chiming away in the background, placing songs such as ""Meet and Greet"" or ""The Right Place"" in a compelling purgatory between drift and uplift.</p>
<p>It's experimental music, to be sure, but it doesn't conflate experimentation with alienation. Even on a song like ""Falling Out"", where the band casts away most familiar pop frameworks, the track's elliptical appeal pulls you in rather than pushes you away. This holds true as well when the minimalist industrial bricolage of ""Open Your Eyes"" begins to transform itself halfway through, working toward an inspiring resolution with trance-inducing drums and a circular guitar pattern that turns the song inside out.</p>
<p>""Away"" ends the album on a sleight-of-hand note, like the punctuation mark to a wonderful tone poem that leaves the listener quietly pondering just what made the preceding music so special. After all, making scary noises and offering carefully crafted unease will always be fashionable. Offering something this open and hopeful, on the other hand, is a much tougher prospect, but as strange as Slaraffenland can be, there's little doubt the disc does just that. Let others point out the looming apocalypse. Slaraffenland see the massing clouds, but would rather focus beyond them, all the way to the stars.</p></div>"|13534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13534-were-on-your-side/|7.6|Joshua Klein

When he's not making his own records as the leader of Doveman, you can probably catch him playing keyboards for someone famous or indie-famous-- Yoko Ono, Bebel Gilberto, David Byrne, Antony, Grizzly Bear, and the National, to name a few. When you play with such a range of musicians, it helps to have a personal style to retreat to when you make your own music, and over his first two albums (and his full-length cover of the <i>Footloose</i> soundtrack, which buzzkill lawyers and industry types have forced him to stop giving away on his website), he's established one. It can be summed up in a word: quiet.</p>
<p>Bartlett's vocal style seems to have been developed singing infants to sleep-- breathy, soft, hardly more than a melodic whisper, really. The music follows suit, but he manages to find a pretty amazing variety at a low decibel level. The guys in his band-- Dougie Bowne, Sam Amidon, Shahzad Ismaily, and Peter Ecklund-- have backgrounds in a wide swath of music including mountain folk, Moroccan trance, punk, jazz, blues-rock, avant-garde, and neoclassical, and you hear bits and pieces of all of these on the record, even as it remains resolute in its mission to remain hushed. The band's own website calls it ""lamp rock,"" whatever that means-- my guess is they're referring to the way the music spills into the room like light from an area lamp, providing ambiance and a bit of illumination.</p>
<p><i>The Conformist </i>bridges the album era and the mp3 era in a weird way-- it hangs together well, but sounds better broken down into individual tracks. When any of these come up in a shuffle, they sound great (and it's likely to sound different from whatever comes before and after), but the album as a unit requires quite a bit of patience due to its lack of peaks and valleys. The diversity comes from the backing tracks, which range from burbling, slow-core electro on ""Memorize"" to oozing, textural string arrangements that shift with György Ligeti-ish fluency on ""Tigers"", an American Analog Set-ish pulse on ""Hurricane"" (slathered in spacey synth), and basic strumming on closer ""Castles"", which ultimately takes on a country tinge.</p>
<p>It's hard to pick standout tracks, because the quality is as consistent as the level of intensity, meaning everything more or less comes out equal. The shifts from minimal passages to bigger arrangements and ultimately to a drum-led coda that hints at free improv elevate ""From Silence"", while Bartlett's vocal on ""The Best Thing"", doubled by a very quiet Matt Berninger of the National, offers one of the best melodies. ""The Cat Awoke"" is another candidate-- the brisk pace, led by banjo and some atmospheric guitar work, builds to a restrained climax that... well, it moves to another pretty quiet section. I don't mean for that to sound so facetious, but your enjoyment of this album will likely depend on how much attention you can devote to its subtle shifts and varied textures, as it moves from one muted moment to the next.</p></div>"|13572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13572-the-conformist/|6.9|Joe Tangari

If it's a joke, it's a kind-hearted one: Most people at Mountain Goats shows know the words and aren't afraid to sing them. Some weep while doing it. Darnielle has power over his audience, but he doesn't wield it-- instead, he posits himself as one of them: Someone moved by small stories of liquor-store clerks struggling with big concerns like salvation; a cautious optimist with empathy for the last gasp and the broken promise; someone who holds a melting candle for four-chord American folk music; a ""lyrics guy.""</p>
<p>He sings a song about best friends whose dreams of death-metal stardom are crushed when one is shipped off to school. The story ends with Darnielle crowing, ""hail Satan!"" Everyone under the roof crows with him. Darnielle's voice swells and his face fills with light. The irony is obvious, but I don't think that's why he's happy. (And I doubt he even registers it-- during performances, he squints, bucks, shouts ""yeah!"" before just about every instrumental break, and is in general totally unselfconscious.) My guess is he's happy because he's singing about two people who have found god for themselves, even if they couldn't decide whether to call their band Satan's Fingers or the Killers or the Hospital Bombers.</p>
<p>This is how he works: Imposing grand themes on squalor, lending dignity to those who have none, passing gentle hands over people who probably deserve the lash. He's written an album about the salvation of meth-heads and another about the bond between codependent alcoholics. Under a canopy of violins on last year's ""Marduk T-Shirt Men's Room Incident"", he detailed what was either a rape or a murder with a voice a prosecutor might point out as sounding almost sympathetic. On 2005's ""Love Love Love"", the sick feeling in Raskolnikov's stomach-- after murdering Alyona Ivanovna in <i>Crime and Punishment</i>-- is posited as a reflex of love. Hallmark may disagree.</p>
<p>This keeps him honest and makes it almost impossible for him to be sentimental. In an interview early last year, I asked him if he loved his characters. ""I have loads of affection for them all, for sure,"" he said. ""But my relationship to most of them is the relationship you have with a close friend who you know is also a chronic liar.""</p>
<p>These themes-- forgiveness, redemption, religion generally, and the Bible specifically-- have backlit his writing since the early 1990s, from boombox-recorded albums for tape-only labels like Shrimper to full-band albums like <i>Tallahassee</i>, which Darnielle started releasing in 2002 for 4AD. (I've told curious friends that his music was ""alt-Christian,"" which ends the conversation pretty quickly.) But he's never been as explicit about the Bible as on <i>The Life of the World to Come, </i>12 songs about ""hard lessons"" he learned from specific verses.</p>
<p>Thankfully he's not a pedant about it, and his songs aren't songs of praise. He's a lapsed Catholic and professed nonbeliever who told Pitchfork he still chants the Hare Krishna. He is, in his own words, ""into"" the Bible. He makes use of the book for what it is: A series of stories used to comfort and instruct us. Joan Didion once wrote that ""we tell ourselves stories in order to live."" Darnielle is a professed fan.</p>
<p><i>Life</i>'s tone is quiet and contemplative. The raw-nerve hollering of his early music is gone (except on ""Psalms 40:2"", where there's a blast of raw-nerve hollering so forceful that he's basically excused from straining himself in perpetuity). But over the past few albums he's filed his whisper into a tool as unique as his shout. The cataclysmic shutter-rattling of fan favorites like ""Going to Georgia"" is replaced with songs like ""Genesis 30:3"" and ""Ezekiel 7 and the Permanent Efficacy of Grace""-- in the latter (based on a verse where god promises total fucking disaster), Darnielle's narrator ties up a hostage, drives through torrential rain, shoots up in the car as the world ends, and still never breaks out of his library voice. In these cases, the music's intensity <i>comes from</i> Darnielle's restraint instead of being undermined it.</p>
<p>He still drives at uncomfortable dissonance: A vandal realizes vandalism is his way of standing closer to god; someone all but sings ""Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah"" from a hospital bed. In general, though, Darnielle's presence is ruminative and gentle. The arrangements are simpler, too-- mostly acoustic guitar, bass, and drums, occasionally accompanied by a small string section. Sometimes, just his voice and a piano, an instrument Darnielle was trained on as a child but didn't play with the Mountain Goats until 2005. (His self-taught guitar playing was a big part of the music's primitive appeal.) <i>Life </i>has no marimba jollies or effects-box glitter. No reggae-esque songs like ""New Zion"" or anthemic alt-rock like ""Autoclave"". This isn't a good, bad, or even surprising thing-- its simplicity actually echoes early Mountain Goats albums more clearly than anything he's released in the past few years.</p>
<p>While he might elicit the specific from his listeners, his music-- especially here-- is general. This is his gift and the gift of effective storytellers: to build toward the general by using the specific. Jacob works for seven years to marry Rachel. Rachel is barren. Rachel asks him to sleep with her servant, Bilhah, so they can raise children. And now there's a Mountain Goats song called ""Genesis 30:3"" about the cheeks we turn and the tasks we take on for the people we love most. In a way, it's like he's giving back to his fans or anyone who wants to listen: He spends an album relating to some of his favorite stories and tacitly invites us to do the same-- to consider what we've lived through and what we've learned.</p>
<p>At a recent Q&amp;A with the filmmaker Rian Johnson, who'd shot him playing <i>Life </i>in a Pomona College auditorium, Darnielle talked about how we'd hunted certain species to extinction, losing a relative to cancer, and valleys of paralyzing depression. He knew when to make a joke, and he made them often-- he has a really vigilant sense of humor, actually, which people who find him whiny probably don't expect. But his intensity radiates even when he's joking: One story he told involved a sound guy who'd asked him if he'd seen a particular film, and his response was, ""Does it have a guy in a hockey mask hacking up teenagers?"" The guy said no. ""Then I probably haven't seen it.""</p>
<p>""I'm not great with personal boundaries,"" he said later, ""so I'm sorry if I'm making anyone here uncomfortable."" Well, a little. But the discomfort isn't without redemption; it's part and parcel. It's probably what most of us came for.</p>

That's a great look for Massive Attack; Burial's moody skitter-fog should mesh beautifully with Massive Attack's heady creep. But if the teaser EP <i>Splitting the Atom</i> is any indication, that Burial remix joint will probably make a better and more convincing Massive Attack album than the next actual Massive Attack album.</p>
<p>That's not really a surprise. In the past 18 years, Massive Attack have released only four albums. And the last of those, 2003's <i>100th Window</i>, was the first album of theirs to fully fade into wallpaper when you weren't paying very close attention. Since then, they've busied themselves with stuff like the score to the fairly badass Jet Li flick <i>Unleashed</i>, seemingly giving up on recapturing the power they once had. Back when they were pretty much inventing trip-hop, the group built bruised hellscapes out of whatever they could find: dusty rap breakbeats, film-score orchestral stabs, creeped-out 2-Tone skank. They knew just when to drop something unexpected into the mix, like the downtuned metal guitar that always raised goosebumps on ""Angel"". But on <i>100th Window</i>, they stopped building tracks, letting the grooves just sit there instead. And despite the deeply impressive roster of guest vocalists on <i>Splitting the Atom</i>, they're still stuck in that rut-- and, just as alarmingly, so are their remixers.</p>
<p><i>Splitting the Atom</i> has four tracks: two new originals, and two remixes of new songs we've yet to hear. The title track uses the deep mutters of 3D and Daddy G and the angelic, quavery croon of reggae vet and longtime collaborator Horace Andy. The track has all the elements of the group's classic sound: funhouse organs, ""Ghost Town"" echo-rattles, organ drone, voices that just flutter in the background without ever quite revealing themselves. The lyrics evoke a slow apocalypse: ""It never stops and we'll never learn/ No hope without dope and the jobless return."" But the song's drum-track is clumsy and pedestrian, and the song doesn't move toward anything; it just plods quietly along for five minutes. ""Pray for Rain"" recruits TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe to growl stony, disconnected imagery over a sprawling, expansive groove. In its seven minutes, the song does hint at something bigger, but after the cool little Aphex Twin bleeps come in, it just doubles back to its slow beginning, repeating the whole first verse over again. These days, Adebimpe's regular producer, Dave Sitek, is way better at these nervously monolithic jams.</p>
<p>The two remixes, meanwhile, both seem content to sloppily imitate the Knife without really indicating that the songs underneath all the spooky vocoders are worthy of attention. Elbow's Guy Garvey's mewls are barely audible on the Van Rivers and the Subliminal Kid remix of ""Bulletproof Love"", and onetime Tricky muse Martina Topley-Bird growls through filters on the Flash treatment of ""Psyche"". The Knife are a good blueprint for haunted synth tracks, and the version of ""Psyche"" might be the heaviest thing here, but it sounds nothing like Massive Attack. Maybe these original tracks will make more of an impact on the actual album, but I can't see how.</p>
<p>With last year's <i>Third</i>, Bristol contemporaries Portishead proved that trip-hop old heads can still make damaged masterpieces that rival anything they ever did. But Portishead did it by leaping way beyond their old sound, not repeating their tricks and hoping they'll tickle the same buttons. If the next Massive Attack album is to mean anything, it'll need to do way more than play connect-the-dots with big-name collaborators-- it'll need to tap into something primal.</p></div>"|13574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13574-splitting-the-atom/|4.4|Tom Breihan

You can't understand the  1980s without watching the promos for ""Rio"" (yachts!) and ""Save a Prayer"" (elephants!), but the album has higher peaks. ""Hungry Like  The Wolf"" is the group at their most lustily, nonsensically exciting,  and the self-mythologizing ""Hold Back the Rain"" supercharges the  band's early synth-pop sound and strafes it with gated snare drums  to magnificently shameless effect. As for ""The Chauffeur"", <i>Rio's</i> big art-rock climax, it's a new wave ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"": cryptic,  stately, sealed into its time but defining it.</p>
<p><i>Rio</i> is, as it was in 1982, a  romp of a record-- so how does loading it with extras affect that?

With the record selling slowly  in the US, they had most of the first side remixed to sound punchier  and more dancefloor-ready. These ""Carnival Remixes"" sit next to  the songs' UK original mixes and the Night Versions-- and in some  cases the demo versions too-- and the differences honestly aren't  great enough to justify listening to all of them. The 2xCD package  is probably best used as a way of recreating whichever version of <i>Rio</i> floats your nostalgia yacht.</p>
<p><i>Live at Hammersmith  '82!</i> is a different matter.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt has morphed from dorky supporting character who can't even throw his own punches in <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i> to... dorky leading man fooling around with Zooey Deschanel in this summer's (kinda great!) <i>(500) Days of Summer</i>. Jim and Pam from ""The Office"" not only got hitched, they're already expecting. It's gotten to the point where I feel bad about my teenage cousin's romantic prospects because he started looking <i>less</i> like Michael Cera.</p>
<p>The Crayon Fields negotiate the transition from virginal boys to men with rickety chamber-pop aplomb on sophomore LP <i>All the Pleasures of the World</i>. On predecessor <i>Animal Bells</i>, which introduced the Melbourne four-piece's winningly wispy take on Zombies-Byrds harmonies and Elephant 6 ramshackleness, frontman Geoff O'Connor sang, ""I want to be famous, gee."" <i>All the Pleasures of the World </i>ditches the childishness of the debut and the obliqueness of the side project without losing sweetness or nuance. Adding strings and a new-relationship glow, it's the kind of album that could make the Crayon Fields downright lovable.</p>
<p>Reference points: the Crayon Fields covered heartbreaking New England folkie Kath Bloom as a recent B-side, and current fellow Down Under-er Jens Lekman is DJing an upcoming album release party. So on opening track ""Mirror Ball"", released on 7"" last year, the object of our narrator's affection reduces him to ""a virgin in a dancehall""; where the Velvet Underground and Nico promised ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", O'Connor reflects, ""You are still my mirror ball,"" Pavement scrawl intersecting bashful 1960s teen-pop sway. Second single ""Voice of Paradise"" starts off closer to vintage Syd Barrett spaciness, then recycles one of the previous album's lyrics, like a bedsit Kurt Vile-- all to let O'Connor's beloved know how ""lucky"" he feels. You won't gag, I promise.</p>
<p>But you may get that feeling in your stomach like you just drove over a dip in the highway. <i>All the Pleasures of the World</i> is, in some ways, a celebration of hovering between two worlds. On the title track (and upcoming third single), O'Connor is too young to love, so he just loves everything. On slightly too long string-backed love epic ""Lucky Again"", which captures the embarrassing hyperbole of freshly requited adoration more accurately than I've seen outside indie romcoms, he's too young to lie about his age, but old enough to forget. And, on ""Celebrate"": ""Surely we're old enough to have plenty to celebrate/ And young enough to have more if we wait/ But let's not today."" Not a girl, not yet a woman; the innocence of classic pop, the messiness of the recent indie past.</p>
<p>In a song title: ""Timeless"", almost. This is the one the kids who believe said romcoms will be putting on mixes for new girlfriends and boyfriends. Bells and bird chirps make it easy to picture the dawn-lit scene as O'Connor murmurs, ""When I wake up next to you, I forget I have a day to be dressed for."" The Crayon Fields could've left this one a Nick Drake strings-and-acoustic ballad. But they don't. <i>All the Pleasures of the World</i> is an album for people who listen to the Clientele while reading the Sunday newspaper and making tea, and it's an album for people who listen to Camera Obscura while sighing wistfully, and most of all it's an album for people overjoyed with finding themselves, suddenly, rapturously, between hello and goodbye. ""There are so many things I should've felt long ago that I'm just feeling now,"" O'Connor confesses on ""Graceless"". Hey, you know who used to sleep under a Peter Pan poster? Bruce Springsteen, that's who. Look it up.</p></div>"|13531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13531-all-the-pleasures-of-the-world/|7.8|Marc Hogan

Phones are all over the indie pop band's third full-length effort: they ring with no one to answer them; calls are short and only reinforce the distance, both literal and emotional, between yourself and the ones you love. The telephone serves as the great motif and most pernicious tool in reinforcing the album's overriding theme, which is how frail, fraught, and difficult to maintain the connections are between family, lovers, and friends.</p>
<p>You may be thinking this synopsis sounds pretty heady for an indie-pop record, especially coming from a band that rather guilelessly trumpets itself as ""Indie Rock for People Who Love Pop"" on its web site, and that made its biggest splash to date with a politely infectious single called ""Cherry Tulips"". It's actually quite easy to listen to <i>Wildlife</i> as a breezily low-key indie pop record if that's what you'd prefer, though that short-sells the group's admirable conceptual accomplishments. Musically, the album is largely loose-limbed and friendly, from the ringing, melodic guitar lines of ""Telephones"" to the easy sun-kissed vibes of ""Get Going"" to the almost cheekily hollow trashcan drumbeats of ""Love Song for Buddy"". ""I Don't Mind at All"" approximates the tense propulsion of Broken Social Scene, but that's about as sonically pensive as it gets. Even the group's purposefully moody musical bum trips are mostly too benign to really sting, and the album's generally undemonstrative character makes it ripe for an ignorable listen assuming you're not feeling inclined to really dig beneath its placidly shimmering surfaces.</p>
<p>So <i>Wildlife</i> isn't exactly bursting at the seams with earworms, but it's a worthy achievement for taking a poignant, powerful emotional state and carrying its thread for 42 minutes. The band's bio admits <i>Wildlife</i> was a difficult album to make, the recording process marked by a near-total scrapping of material at one point as well as the eventual departure of guitarist John Owen. It seems this tumultuous experience-- along with other, unspecified personal hardships-- deeply affected the outlooks of songwriting principals Tristan Wraight and Erin Fein. More than anything, emphasis seems to be placed on how difficult it is to maintain friendships throughout the passage of time-- maybe it's something as simple as the fact that you're ""so far from home"" (""Telephones""), or maybe your friends are physically close, but are just ""too busy growing old"" (""Dead Ends""). Fein in particular tries desperately to break through, pratically breathless in her desire on ""Secrets"" to know another's darkest moments and deepest agonies. By the end of <i>Wildlife</i>, it's almost as if the effort of trying to connect and understand has left everyone emotionally exhausted-- without wallowing in nostalgia, the closing ""Slow Down Town"" muses on ""Easier times/ When your friends were around/ And they called you on the weekend/ And you knew where all the people hung out."" If you've stayed with Headlights this long, chances are when the record ends you yourself will be grabbing a phone and making a call, and hoping you don't get sent to voice mail.</p></div>"|13580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13580-wildlife/|6.4|Joshua Love

Those words, when James Murphy over-enunciated them on what's still arguably the decade's best piece of music-as-music-criticism-- LCD Soundsystem's 2002 debut single, ""Losing My Edge""-- had the decisive feel of a gauntlet being thrown down. One 1980s baby struck back with a Nintendo Power Glove. Just a guess: Probably not what Murphy had in mind.</p>
<p>Of course, cheaply copied reminiscences of a blurrily imagined decade are basically their own genre now, cloudy and proud. The sound has many names, but none of them seem to fit just right. Dream-beat, chillwave, glo-fi, hypnagogic pop, even hipster-gogic pop-- all are imperfect phrases for describing a psychedelic music that's generally one or all of the following: synth-based, homemade-sounding, 80s-referencing, cassette-oriented, sun-baked, laid-back, warped, hazy, emotionally distant, slightly out of focus. Washed Out. Memory Tapes. Ducktails. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frGLMtGsotc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ah-woo-ooh</a>.</p>
<p>For Alan Palomo, reflecting on the music of the Reagan era has a personal component. The Texas-reared Mexico native's dad, Jorge, was a bit of a Spanish-language pop star in the late 1970s and early 80s. The analog electronics of that bygone period echo throughout the younger Palomo's increasingly promising previous recordings, whether with former band Ghosthustler (he wore the Power Glove in the video for their ""Parking Lot Nights"") or, more recently, on VEGA's <i>Well Known Pleasures</i> EP. Finally, working with Brooklyn-based visual collaborator Alicia Scardetta as Neon Indian, Palomo has brought all the best of 2009's summer sounds-- bedroom production, borrowed nostalgia, unresolved sadness, deceptively agile popcraft-- together on a single album.</p>
<p>Whatever they owe to the past, the memories on <i>Psychic Chasms</i> are Palomo's and ours. Soft vocals recalling <i>You Made Me Realise</i>-era Kevin Shields. Italo-disco synth arpeggios. Hall &amp; Oates drum sounds. Divebombing video-game effects. Brittle guitar distortion. Manipulated tapes that bend the notes the way Shields' ""glide guitar"" did, the way bluesmen's fret fingers did. Field recordings of birds. Oohing and ahhing backing vocals. And samples, on at least two songs, of the elder Palomo, whose electro-rock approach was quite similar. All combine on eight or nine unforgettable songs and a few tantalizingly brief interludes, indelibly capturing the glamor and bleary malaise of being young and horny as an empire devours itself.</p>
<p>Like a low-rent Daft Punk, Palomo takes what 1990s rock fans probably would've considered cheesy-- LinnDrum and Oberheim rhythms, Chromeo-plated electro-funk Korg riffs, processed party-vocal samples-- and not only makes them part of a distinct artistic vision, but also keeps them fun. Quick opener ""(AM)"" is rife with detail, as an indecipherable tenor floats over a mock-dramatic drum fill and 8-bit star cruisers do battle against twinkling fairy dust. Another sub-minute interstitial track, ""(If I Knew, I'd Tell You)"", keeps its secrets to itself, letting multiple melodic synth lines hint at a gulf-sized pool of melancholy over a tape-altered rhythm track. ""Laughing Gas"", at slightly more than a lyric-less minute and a half, is the one that ruins my attempted distinction between songs and interludes, with bongo drums, robot vocal samples, and euphoric giggles straight out of those Air France kids' dreams. The cumulative result is a meltdown-deadened but deliriously inventive perspective on pop.</p>
<p>""I really hope the medium by which someone writes a song isn't the only thing the song has going for it,"" Palomo told our own Ryan Dombal in a recent interview. With <i>Psychic Chasms</i>, Palomo doesn't need to worry. ""Deadbeat Summer"" and ""Should Have Taken Acid With You"" are two views of the same non-endless season-- one mind-expandingly lazy and the other too lazy for mind expansion, both undeniably catchy, both earning doctorates in <i>The Graduate</i> school of coming-of-age ennui. The Italo-alluding title track, the New Order-throbbing ""Local Joke"", and the visceral funk alarums of ""Ephemeral Artery"" are beautiful bummers, tracks with lyrics the faithful are sure to puzzle out the way kids used to with the first couple of Weezer CDs. ""Living this way held by a single strand/ But you wouldn't understand,"" worries ""6669 (I Don't Know If You Know)"", which comes back, refracted again, as 56-second finale ""7000 (Reprise)"". If you want to destroy his sweater, hold this thread as he walks away.</p>
<p>Overall, <i>Psychic Chasms</i> is something like a dream collaboration between the Tough Alliance and Atlas Sound, the latter of whose Internet-only <i>Weekend</i> EP shares a delinquent theme with one of <i>Psychic Chasms</i>' best songs. After barely a half hour, the whole thing is over, but there's enough going on in the layered electronics and enigmatic longing to make this one of the year's most replayable albums. Consider ""Terminally Chill"", which has more vocal and instrumental hooks than the average Top 40 song, but also the immediately recognizable stamp of an impressive young talent. Palomo's gear was stolen last month while on tour with VEGA, but a recent <i>FADER</i> video suggests he could launch a decently credible alternate ""career"" as an acoustic troubadour doing Mexican traditional songs. For various mundane personal reasons, this cassette-focused album is one of the actual CDs I've listened to most since I actually listened to CDs. A new generation's borrowed nostalgia? High time.</p></div>"|13510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13510-psychic-chasms/|8.6|Marc Hogan

If you're cynical, you might say he's become the thing he once railed against: an establishment artist coasting on the good will of his back catalog. If you're generous, you might argue-- fairly circuitously-- that he's simply rebelling against yesterday's rebellion. Either way, it's worth remembering that he grew up listening to Sinatra and Ellington and covered ""My Funny Valentine"" as a B-side back in 1978. Four years after releasing his debut, <i>My Aim Is True</i>, he released an album of country music covers.</p>
<p>Because it came first, that angry-young-man intensity is often taken as his default setting, but perhaps Costello's punk-era sound was just another stopover on his odyssey through 20th century popular music. That breadth of interest and influence is apparent in even his earliest material: in its emphatic melodicism, in its clever arrangements, in his osmotic absorption of contemporary styles, even if they were raw (ska, pub rock) rather than refined (jazz, Bacharach). He may have been young, he may have been righteously pissed, but he sounds worldly on those early albums, and especially on <i>Live at the El Mocambo</i>.</p>
<p>Recorded in Toronto on Costello's 1978 tour for <i>My Aim Is True</i>, the album was originally released as a promotional item, survived the 1980s as a bootleg, and finally got a commercial release as part of the 1993 box set <i>2½ Years</i>. It's now a standalone reissue as the first installment in his new series of live reissues. This version reinstates much of the stage banter that was cut from the '93 version, including Costello's boast that he and the Attractions have come to reclaim Canada for the Crown. For an artist with so many disparate releases under his belt, Costello doesn't have a whole lot of live albums, which makes <i>El Mocambo</i> particularly revealing, even if it does cover only a limited set of songs.</p>
<p>Costello here is a fierce, funny, and intelligent performer, which is certainly no surprise. Nor is the energy with which he and the band pound out raucous versions of ""Welcome to the Working Week"" and ""Lipstick Vogue"". Headlong on the studio albums, these songs are ferocious live, and it helps that they have a rowdy crowd in front of them, who whoop, holler, and call out requests for ""Allison"" (which he doesn't play). One guy yahoos so much he should get a performance credit. It's an electric atmosphere, and the setting brings out the swaggering pre- and early-rock sounds in these songs, suggesting that, even as a young artist, Costello was already fully engaged with the past. Opener ""Mystery Dance"" sounds like it was built on the same two-note guitar theme as that other Elvis' ""Jailhouse Rock"", and, on the intro to ""I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea"", each instrument seems to be playing in a different style: Bruce Thomas' strutting ska bassline throwing punches at Steve Nieve's New Wave-ish keyboard dodging Costello's swooping guitar. It's hard to keep up.</p>
<p>These are tricky, slippery songs. ""Waiting for the End of the World"" changes shape almost constantly, as Nieve's keyboard trades off leads with Costello then ducks back into the rhythm section. And just when the setlist reaches a fevered peak, they break into ""Little Triggers"", giving Costello a surprising amount of room to croon and offsetting the reckless rush of ""Lip Service"" and ""Radio, Radio"". They obliterate the reggae rhythms of ""Watching the Detectives"" but play up the noir mood before launching into a start-stop bridge. And after Costello taunts the audience (""He doesn't think I mean it!""), the Attractions and guitarist Martin Belmont hammer away at the central riff of ""Pump It Up"" violently, growing more frenzied and frantic with each repetition until the whole show falls apart, ending with a full minute of steady clapping and calls for another encore. It's a painful reminder that Costello hasn't left us wanting more in ages.</p></div>"|13533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13533-live-at-the-el-mocambo/|8.4|Stephen M. Deusner

There's a number of reasons it's been a 12"" genre from the get-go, even as running times shrank from the 14-plus-minute marathon of the original ""Rapper's Delight"" to the three-and-change of ""Sucker MC's""-- the most prominent being that 45s are an absolute bastard to cut and mix. When DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist did it during their <i>Hard Sell </i>tour a couple years back, they preceded the show with a goofy little introductory faux-industrial short that highlighted all the pitfalls of DJing with 7"" records: less surface space to work with, the looseness of center-hole adapters, and a faster speed to try and keep up with.</p>
<p>Now take into account the fact that Peanut Butter Wolf actually went and made 7"" edits of 18 different tracks ranging from the dawn of hip-hop to the peak of its late-1980s golden age. PBW's messed around with hip-hop on 45 before, most prominently on 2007's <i>Yo! 45 Raps</i> mix, but to deliberately hack down old-school hop-hop classics to bite-sized individual servings seems like kind of a weird redundancy. The vinyl version did at least result in an interesting collector's item-- a stack of newly-pressed 45s of these edits, stacked inside a PiL-style circular metal box and sold through Stones Throw's site-- yet is there really any benefit to hearing your favorite hip-hop classics, but shorter?</p>
<p>As it turns out, there damn well is-- at least if they're mixed. The vinyl box set's an interesting curio, but the CD version's where the real goldmine is. By now it should go without saying that PBW's one of those heads who talks cratedigging but walks DJing, and his skills make <i>45 Live </i>a perfectly sequenced, smartly-paced and sharply-cut love letter to hip hop across the 80s. Its 49-ish minutes are bookended with a couple of canonical favorites: Fearless Four's Kraftwerk-appropriating 1982 electro-rap classic ""Rockin' It"" begins the mix, and it's closed out by BDP's deathless ""The Bridge Is Over"", with its intro chopped and spun back so it sounds as if he's playing that breakbeat/piano loop like a yo-yo. And between those two tracks is a familiar but momentum-filled rundown of hip-hop's first decade of evolution.</p>
<p>The old-school-heavy early minutes of the mix are maybe the most intriguing, considering that the first seven tracks-- about 40 minutes' worth of music in their original form-- are cut down to less than half of their total running time, resulting in a crash course in how electrifying and strange pre-Run-DMC hip-hop could be. The first three tracks set a strong precedent with the ""Man Machine""-sourced Fearless Four opener, the minimalist percussion-only funk of Spoonie Gee's ""Love Rap"", and the burbling disco-dub cut ""Tricky Tee Rap"" (whose titular MC, the liner notes observe, sounds kind of like current Common). There's even a ringer: Busy Bee's hilarious, ""Apache""-sampling curse-word-fakeout track ""Old School"" is a straight-up throwback, recorded in 1988 and made to sound a decade older.</p>
<p>The transition from old school to early golden age is represented with a one-two that sets the pace for the rest of the mix: ""Sucker D.J.'s (I Will Survive)"", Dimples D's Marley Marl-produced response to Run-DMC, and T La Rock's Def Jam-christening lyrical watershed ""It's Yours"". From there on out it's a succession of greatness, heavy on Juice Crew material (""Make the Music With Your Mouth, Biz""; ""Marley Marl Scratch""; Big Daddy Kane's ""Just Rhymin' With Biz""), vintage headknock (JVC Force's ""Strong Island""; Just-Ice's ""Cold Gettin' Dumb"") and a two-fer of lyrical party rap that extends outside the five boroughs to Philadelphia (Cash Money &amp; Marvelous' ""Mighty Hard Rocker"") and New Haven (Stezo's ""It's My Turn"").</p>
<p>So maybe the format isn't the real point-- it's the trip down memory lane that counts. <i>45 Live </i>isn't just a historical look, but a personal one, too; PBW's liner notes outline all kinds of observations regarding coming of age listening to hip-hop across the country from where these singles were recorded (""I remember when KRS first came out, I was such an MC Shan fan, yet KRS was so dope, it really messed me up""), and he goes on the kinds of enthusiastic tangents you get only from the deeply committed. It's easy to look at the tracklisting, see the roster of well-loved old-school singles and shrug at its familiarity, even if it's still a treat to listen to all over again. But Peanut Butter Wolf didn't just have memories of his younger self's education in mind when he assembled <i>45 Live</i>-- this mix is put together in a way that makes it an ideal introduction to vintage rap for kids who are currently the same age he was when they first came out.</p></div>"|13546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13546-45-live/|7.5|Nate Patrin
