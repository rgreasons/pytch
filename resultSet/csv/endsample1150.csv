The straight-from-the-diary     lyrics, the sudden screams and that hiccuping vibrato-- the qualities that make him seem raw and, to some,     risible-- are also striking and awesome.  Oberst is a strange hybrid: He's undeniably a pop star, and also     undeniably an indie rocker.  On the pop side, he has what music journalist Simon Reynolds identified as the     power to compel your gaze, and when he gets it, those wet, penetrating eyes stare straight back.  I know it     makes me uncomfortable; why can't he just look at his feet and fumble with his guitar and murmur his songs     from a distance?</p>
<p>At the same time, where most of our pop stars spring fully formed from the heads of their handlers, Oberst     remains a DI(mostly)Y, friends-over-money, fuck-the-man independent musician.  He makes mistakes, indulges     his excesses (oh, <i>Lifted</i>, how close you were to a home run), and even shouts his politics, inarticulately     but without restraint, which is something that fewer and fewer musicians at his tier would have the guts to     do their first time on <i>Craig Kilborn</i>.</p>
<p>As you've probably heard from the media blitz, tomorrow Oberst is releasing both a record of road-tested     acoustic material and a new project of electronica-flavored pop.  The specific triumph of his two new albums     lies in how they deliver a new, more seasoned Oberst, retaining what's great in his talent while purging the     rough edges.</p>
<p>Let's start with the album that's merely ""decent.""  Oberst and producer Mike Mogis had talked about making     a more rhythmic and electronic album since even before <i>Lifted</i>, and <i>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</i> finally realizes that project, setting Oberst in front of a rock band, beats and strings.  But where a     Björk would have tackled this by flitting around the world to find the hottest club DJs and the coldest     Inuit choirs, Oberst put the record together with a small crew of his buddies: While Jimmy Tamborello of     the Postal Service co-produced the first single, ""Take It Easy (Love Nothing)"" and the Yeah Yeah Yeah's     Nick Zinner swings by for a few cameos, the producer that Oberst relies on most heavily is Mogis, who     programs under the alias the Digital Audio Engine.</p>
<p><i>Digital Ash</i> places Oberst's voice front and center, stripping away his guitar and impromptu     vocalizations and tying him to each song like a good pop star; witness the way he takes ""Devil in the     Details"" with the stance of a Bowie.  And where the lyrics are self-centered, Oberst still projects     himself more broadly and concisely than on <i>Lifted</i>, as he ruminates from up high on everything from     the circle of life and death to admitting that he's a dick when he drinks.</p>
<p>But if Oberst picked up better posture, he's still learning where to take it.  It's hard to pinpoint why     <i>Digital Ash</i> is merely ""okay.""  The songs are enjoyable, and if Tamborello chips in the most exciting     beats, Mogis' are competitive, especially the bamboo-footed-tap-dancer rhythms of ""Arc of Time (Time Code)""     or the moody ""nightmare"" sequence that launches the record.  But nothing else captures such a gripping mood.     <i>Digital Ash</i> has the claustrophobic feel of a singer locked up with a computer, and it's distractingly     chipper, like Rilo Kiley in their own Dntel homages; not every Bright Eyes record has to be an emotional     epic, but <i>Digital Ash</i> feels like a practice run.  Consider it version 1.0.</p>
<p>If <i>Digital Ash</i> sounds like indie kids breaking into pop, its sister disc, <i>I'm Wide Awake, It's     Morning</i>, is a red-blooded folk album that's coincidentally built to be hugely, hugely popular.  Oberst     has been so close to Americana that <i>I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning</i> won't surprise anyone, and even     Emmylou Harris' glorious cameos aren't a stamp of approval so much as a professional decision to bring in     someone who can nail these harmonies-- a rare and totally warranted exception to the ""friends-only"" policy,     because a twentysomething couldn't make pretty sound as weary as Harris on ""Land Locked Blues"".</p>
<p><i>I'm Wide Awake</i> perfectly captures a place and time in Oberst's life.  It chronicles his first memories     of staying in New York City, and the metropolis rarely gets a folk singer to chronicle its streets this lucidly,     at least since the hootenanny days; he frequents its parties and stumbles down its streets like a midwestern     transplant instead of a jaded hipster, sings about chemical dependency and the endless pains of love, while     capturing as a backdrop the build-up to a foreign war.  <i>I'm Wide Awake</i> weaves the personal and the     political more fluidly than most singers even care to try, and the consummate tunefulness just strengthens     those moments where he pinches a nerve-- the songs that still give me chills every time, like ""At the Bottom     of Everything"": ""Into the face of every criminal strapped firmly to a chair/ We must stare, we must stare,     we must stare.""</p>
<p>This record was made to be loved, to be obsessed over by some but remembered by everybody, to get scratched     and worn out through constant rotation in a sorority living room or your first studio apartment or your mom's     old radio, to capture Conor Oberst for the first time with more polish than spit, but still getting him deeply     under your skin.  And he earns it so thoroughly that while ""Poison Oak"" would have been a fine, graceful     closer, he propels us instead to the big Bright Eyes finale of ""Road to Joy"", where he justifies the joke     of cadging Beethoven's most famous theme, drives the cascading horns and searing guitars, and finally,     finally screams his head off.  Give yourself to it and you'll understand that when Oberst's staring so     piercingly from all those magazine covers, this is what he's looking at.</p></div>"|11683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/|8.7|Chris Dahlen

Her Gothic voice conveys gravity perhaps better than any other rock-oriented singer alive, but that ability comes with its own limitations: While Faithfull can make grim sound bitter, biting, resigned, or determined, she can't make it sound triumphant or joyful. But she has staked this darker emotional territory out and made it her own, such that any shade of hope in her voice sounds sadly tenuous.</p><p>
    
    It wasn't always so. On her early recordings, Faithfull's voice sounds ethereal, girlish, and young, which only underscores the heartache of songs like ""As Tears Go By"" and ""With You in Mind"". From that decade she has emerged as a dark angel, and the low texture now in her voice signifies the many hard years in between. It is, in fact, the perfect vessel for the compromised emotions and defeating betrayals of her new album, <i>Before the Poison</i>.</p><p>
    
    If Faithfull's voice has changed dramatically over the years, her creative method has not. From her first hit (Mick Jagger's ""As Tears Go By"") to her Kurt Weill-inspired <i>20th Century Blues</i> to 2002's celebrity-laden <i>Kissin' Time</i>, Faithfull has done her best work as a collaborator, either covering others' songs or co-writing them with Barry Reynolds or Beck. On <i>Before the Poison</i>, her primary scribe is PJ Harvey, who gives her several complex songs to sing, sometimes even writing beyond her years; Damon Albarn and Jon Brion each contribute one song, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are a perfect choice as a backing band.</p><p>
    
    The mood of these 10 songs is bleak, their subject lost or impossible crazy love. ""The mystery of love belongs to you,"" she confesses on PJ Harvey's ""The Mystery of Love"", as Harvey and Rob Ellis create an elegant tension for Faithfull's crucial question: ""Am I a fool, because of you?"" Harvey also contributes the devastating ""No Child of Mine"", on which Faithfull sings about denying love to a son, as if her rejection will prepare him for a cruel world. But for Harvey, it's an act of heroism, not hatred, and she turns the refrain into a singalong that Faithfull makes majestic: ""Go home, find your own way."" Likewise, Albarn's apocalyptic ballad ""Last Song"" imagines home as a blight: ""We saw the green fields turn into homes, such lovely homes,"" Faithfull sings on the chorus, before explaining ""it's not a love song, it's the last song for you"" in a voice that sounds ragged and weary but self-assured-- almost authoritative.</p><p>
    
    The second half of <i>Before the Poison</i> drops off noticeably, ending with the album's two weakest tracks. The strutting tempo of ""Desperanto"" and its shout-out chorus barely conceal the song's punning conceit, and Brion's gimmicky production and Faithfull's awkward lyrics on ""City of Quartz"" recall her Weill obsession of past albums. Still, Faithfull imbues every song and every word on <i>Before the Poison</i> with the weight of experience, as if age has granted her almost oracular powers. This may not be a perfect album, but it is affecting and haunting.</p></div>"|2962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2962-before-the-poison/|7.9|Stephen M. Deusner

Will Anticon be a parenthetical digression or a chapter in rap's overarching narrative? And can a movement sparked by a group of white kids find lasting purchase in the traditionally black medium of hip-hop?</p><p>
    
    Until Anticon's historical context is resolved, when the winners have been crowned and start writing memoirs, these questions will remain open. While we bandy around terms like ""terrorist"" with careless conviction, that designation is history's, not ours, to assign: George Washington, had his revolution failed, might well be remembered as a terrorist; if the Palestinians succeed in ousting the Israelites from their territories, no number of despicable acts will prevent them from going on the books as freedom fighters.</p><p>
    
    While it seems bizarre to conflate the histories of hip-hop and social violence, that's just what Pedestrian does on his debut LP. <em>Volume One: unIndian songs</em> finds him wandering through a sonic and thematic chronicle of hip-hop and the greater historical context from which it emanates, spanning the gap between old school line-swapping and modern Dirty South crunk; between canned, cracking 80s drums and folk music collage; between the cultural criticism of Public Enemy and Anticon's esoteric navel gazing; between Sage Francis and Woody Guthrie and Ice T and Sole.</p><p>
    
    As such, the album is fractured, coded, shadowy, protean, and strange. Pedestrian's sulfurous meditations on death fill the gaps between songs as diverse as ""O Hosanna"", a Run DMC-style party joint flecked with Nas samples and a gospel choir, and the critique of economic violence ""Lifelong Liquidation Sale (1850-1950)"", which is cloven into two parts-- the first, a buzzing hive of sinister electric guitar and stuttering vocals; the second, a placid dronescape that evokes the barren horizons and kaleidoscopic mutations of cLOUDDEAD. And standout track ""O Silent Bed"" is an undie-hop take on Nelly's lilting sing-song and catchy choruses-- Anticon's first certified club banger.</p><p>
    
    The formerly nonexistent borders around Anticon's sensibility are showing signs of ossification. The off-key singing, chaotic clutter, confessional/intellectual lyrics, and willful obscurity that dominate Pedestrian's debut by now have a whiff of the rote. But as Anticon releases become more predictable, they advance in ambition and coherence of vision, and it's easy to fantasize about an album that perfectly distills the Anticon aesthetic.</p><p>
    
    If one were awaiting this theoretical messiah record, one might expectantly look to this long-awaited LP from Anticon's co-founder and spiritual mentor. With its thematic ambition, fragmentary mien, and cameos from Doseone, why?, Sole, Jel, and others, <em>Volume One: unIndian Songs</em> is the consummate Anticon record in terms of its components. But a large part of Anticon's appeal has been its capacity to surprise, and while Pedestrian's record befuddles, proselytizes, and fascinates, it rarely strays from the established palette. While <em>unIndian songs</em> is a beguiling piece of cultural lore, it further cements what Anticon is, not what it could be, and so this mythical, pure articulation of Anticon potential either already exists and will be acknowledged in the final tally (Them's debut? cLOUDDEAD's <em>Ten</em>?), or shimmers tantalizingly over the next ridge.</p></div>"|6562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6562-volume-one-unindian-songs/|7.4|Brian Howe

And though the album probably serves as an accurate snapshot of his headspace at one fixed point in time, the mercurial nature of Buck's talents have fated this to seem as yet another transitional work.</p><p>
    
    Though ostensibly still a hip-hop artist, the Nova Scotia-born Buck 65 continues to play fast and loose with genre orthodoxy, even by the lax standards of his erstwhile Anticon mates. An inveterate scavenger, Buck's continual search for musical origins has again led him down some unlikely cattle-trails to forge improbable links between hip-hop and rustic C&amp;W;, Alan Lomax's folk field recordings, and Woody Guthrie's dust-bowl balladry.</p><p>
    
    Unabashedly courting comparison to Tom Waits, on <i>This Right Here</i> Buck has entirely abandoned the nasally, rapid-fire vocal delivery of his early albums, in favor of a mannered, scratchy gruffness which implies that he's aged roughly 55 years since 1999. This change is most obvious, and arguably most successful, on the remakes of such early tracks as ""Pants on Fire"" or ""B. Sc."" (otherwise known as ""Bachelor of Science"") where his newly weathered rasp imparts an air of world-weary authority to lines like ""I'd rather read the Bible than use its pages to roll joints with.""</p><p>
    
    Filled with shimmering waves of pedal steel and slide guitar, these spare, gritty reenactments will surely please fans of his 2003 urban-folk platter <i>Talkin' Honky Blues</i>, several tracks of which are included again here in unaltered form. Underground hip-hop enthusiasts, however, might be put off by Buck's near-complete disregard for the rippling, sample-laden funk of his youth, particularly on the cleaned-up version of his semi-classic ""The Centaur"". Played here in a stripped-down, acoustic arrangement (with one lyric cryptically changed from ""my cock is so big and the end of it glistens"" to ""my clock is so clean and the hour-hand is missing,"") the anarchic strangeness of the original is all but lost, while this new, dryly sophomoric edition might lead one to draw uncharitable comparisons to Buck's countrymen in the Barenaked Ladies.</p><p>
    
    But on the best tracks here, such as the coolly swaggering opener ""Bandits"" or his rambunctious cover of Guthrie's ""Talking Fishing Blues"", Buck 65 manages to connect his vivid junkyard hip-hop to deeply earthed roots that you'd never guess were there. At the risk of stretching the association beyond the breaking point, perhaps <i>This Right Here</i> can best be compared to such late-70s Tom Waits albums as <i>Blue Valentine</i> or <i>Heartattack and Vine</i>, where one hears an artist coming tantalizingly close to realizing his matured vision, renewing hopes that Buck 65 might someday deliver the hip-hop <i>Swordfishtrombones</i> he seems destined to create.</p></div>"|1069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1069-this-right-here-is-buck-65/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

The Miners' style of cozy, indolent slow-core is like a person who never gets out of bed: Lost in far-reaching escape dreams, but utterly trapped. Where all harm ends, so do schedules, responsibility, and ambition. Unburdened, the Early Day Miners' trot is a slow one. They seem neither overjoyed nor panicked by their self-imposed isolation; rather, their music reeks of a panging, misanthropic bereavement.</p><p>
    
    ""Errance"" is the getaway anthem. The song is moody and weighed down but not indolent: Propelled by a polyrhythmic drumbeat, it reveals emo-core and math-rock leanings. Early Day Miners' cushy three-guitar front line-- best employed here-- recalls the towering, interwoven melodies of Juno. ""Townes"" unfurls lazily, with a big, weepy, open sound that brings to mind My Morning Jacket or Songs: Ohia. But by and large, Early Day Miners prefer a spacier, more atmospheric style of slow-core, far removed from the melodrama of bands like Low or Red House Painters. Dan Burton doesn't yowl or weep; rather, he sings as if he may have been told to hush a lot as a child.</p><p>
    
    A bit of exaggeration might help: The band often seem bored by their own efforts. For all its droopiness, <i>All Harm Ends Here</i> doesn't engage sadness but toils obliviously in it like a three-week beard. ""The Union Trade"" takes a jittery odd-time frame and renders it comatose. ""Comfort/Guilt"", despite a peppier, shaker-drawn beat, is underpinned by a fusty synth drone, which jives awkwardly with the band's organic mantra. ""All Harm"", the quasi-title track, fares much batter, featuring a crocheted guitar melody, bright and beautiful for its well-drawn opaqueness.</p><p>
    
    As deftly as Early Day Miners work their craft, the slow-core aesthetic is still pegged in an outmoded, mid-90s frame of mind. <i>All Harm Ends Here</i> is hushed and apocryphal, but at times it sounds almost as half-hearted as it is heavy-hearted. The album also pits a nagging inclination to move forward against ruthlessly maintained simplicity. Unfortunately, Early Day Miners choose the comfort of stasis, where their music quickly grows an uneventful wash: How are we supposed to stay engaged when the band act like their own rope has run out?</p></div>"|2657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2657-all-harm-ends-here/|6.3|Sam Ubl

This time around it's a track called ""The Lost You"": An airy shard of a sample stutters and slices itself open into a big, lurching beat, the vocal comes muttering modestly in along with it, and by the time the song fleshes itself out into a chorus you're wide-eyed and wondering why every band can't be this carelessly awesome. It's at moments like this that Hood seems like the greatest thing ever: A band making the kind of Serious Innovative Music people like to imagine Radiohead are, only without a hint that they know or care that they're doing it at all. String together a tight, accessible collection of glorious moments like this, and there's hardly a critic on either side of the Atlantic who wouldn't clamor to cast these guys as the new saviors of music.</p><p>
    
    Only there's a catch: That's not really the kind of band this is. It's not that a track like ""The Lost You"" is so different from the rest of their work-- and it's not that there's anything about the songs around it that's sub-par-- it's just that they're really not interested in glory. Recent Hood recordings have less to do with grand pop gestures than with the kind of wandering pastoralia perfected by the Bristol act Movietone: Sometimes they just want to camp out in a room with acoustic guitar and violin and delay pedals and see how a song crawls into shape on its own. Instead of big-budget drama, Hood are reminiscent of the drifting sound-paintings of Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, or Slowdive's final record. Sometimes the song framework takes a back seat to letting dense arrangements of guitar and piano echo around one another.</p><p>
    
    Hood's previous full-length, <i>Cold House</i>, still made gestures toward crisp, cohesive pop, but <i>Outside Closer</i> gets pretty comfortable with the feeling of sprawl. The result is a whole load of cold-sun-on-moors, last-leaves-on-the-tree material. But what's remarkable is that instead of sounding autumnal and frigid, the bulk of this album has a warmth, an emotional weight, and a sense of underlying motion that competes damn well against the occasional fireworks. Some of these pleasures may be subtle or take time to grasp, but the sinking-in is gorgeous and worth the wait.</p><p>
    
    This, in fact, may be as good as Hood have ever been at letting songwriting and sprawl play off of one another-- even though their electronic tweaks back away and the violin takes a larger role. You'd still need the mind of a musicologist to be able to hum some of these wandering melodies and sleepy English mumbles, but that doesn't make them any harder to take in: Even the most lethargic of them-- seven minutes of slow burn on ""Closure"" and ""Any Hopeful Thoughts Arrive""-- gradually gather into something narrative, ballads recast in an impressionist haze.</p><p>
    
    When they aim for shape, there's still the same sense of variation and sprawl around the edges: The terrific ""The Negatives"" weaves samples, strings, and acoustics into a fine-tuned depth that's almost reminiscent of the Church, but it flows along according to a logic that's anything but conventional. What's most striking here depends on what you're in it for. ""Still Rain Fell"" is a big pastoral wash of acoustic guitars and violin melody that casts this band as a set of sophisticated pop songwriters-- this is the kind of relaxed, languorous sound that makes it feel like Hood are conceiving their material late at night in someone's living room. On the other hand, there are ""Winter 72""-- which actually does cross into the dubbed-out full-band headspace of Bark Psychosis-- and ""This is It, Forever"", which reduces the whole band into a momentary sound-art mutter.</p><p>
    
    It's unknown whether or not that title is a hint the band is going to call it a day. This Leeds collective has been floating through various kinds of gorgeousness for just over a decade, more or less improving with every release; they've also already tried breaking up, but without success. It's not really clear whether that mutter of a send-off genuinely marks the end for Hood, but if it does, this record is a bit of a conflicted curtain: A captivatingly strong release that still leaves you wondering if these guys have a world-conquering album somewhere inside them.</p></div>"|3918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3918-outside-closer/|8.6|Nitsuh Abebe

Not surprisingly, a handful of Italo-themed compilations have been issued in the past 12 months; only a few have been as fun, as revelatory and as representative as <i>Unclassics</i>.</p><p>
    
    Selected, mixed, and bankrolled entirely by Metro Area's Morgan Geist, this mix follows in the tradition of the Environ label head's lovingly deployed <i>Unclassics</i> vinyl releases, which themselves were sort of dust-off and rescue missions for the waylaid orphans of the Italo boom. Cherry-picked and sorta-mixed by Geist himself, the tracks on this continuous set are strung together by all the things that made Italo interesting, namely a sense of goofiness, color, and theatre. To that end, Italo represents the furthest functional extreme from dance music's other current fascination-- microhouse; in the interest of balance and perversity, it makes sense that both should be dominating dance music's discourse at same time.</p><p>
    
    Almost uniformly un-self conscious, <i>Unclassics</i> amounts to a seven-course spread of opulent synths, syrupy melodies, and joyously over-the-top vocal performances. Dance Reaction's ""Disco Train"" is sung by an adenoidal Cameo-soundalike, Victor's ""Go On Do It"" is a campy call-and-response that has slavering raps buzzing up against a female's breathy refrains, and Pluton &amp; Humanoids' ""World Invaders"" contains an opera diva and a vocoded robot anxiously engaging in some sort of epic Wellesian struggle between man and machine (their resolution: duet!)</p><p>
    
    The highlight of the mix is probably Geist's own Hot Edit of Margueritas' shimmering ""Margherita"", which strips it of its made-for-Eurovision vocals and recasts it as an ever zippier ""Popcorn"". Drenched in peppy analog pings, handclaps, and Mexican horns, it's one of the most ridiculously infectious dance tracks in recent memory. Also good is Eurofunk's ""Manshortage"", which deploys a liquid guitar line over a weird, spindly little electro groove. Come to think of it, the only thing that really approaches disco orthodoxy is the twirling strings of the Purple Flash Orchestra's penultimate ""Freedom Now""-- and even that is quickly upended by Gaz Nevada's oddball eight-minute closer, ""Special Agent Man.""</p><p>
    
    It's a weird collection of oblong disco, to be sure, and repeated listens do nothing to diminish its freshness and off-kilter appeal. Credit's due to Geist, not just for being prescient enough to release these tracks at the right time, but for swooping down to rescue them in the first place. Even if it is hard to believe that anybody could ever forget source material like this.</p></div>"|3664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3664-unclassics/|8.4|Mark Pytlik

At this point the scene's an academic discipline, excitement hardly ever reaching outside the station's DJ community. Which is a shame, because I bet there are tons of shows around as fun as Tim Sweeney's ""Beats In Space"" on WNYU 89.1.</p><p>
    Almost every Thursday for the past three years, the NYU student-turned-grad has run down the city's most consistently exciting mixed radio sets. Sweeney breaks lots of new wax, but he's insanely generous too, sneaking in the hits when they fit. While a dancekid at heart, Sweeney plays an expert dilettante, reaching deep into the bowels of hip-hop and stalwart indie alike, then ripping a sparse Playhouse twelve on his way out. After an internship at the DFA, Sweeney's reputation has grown substantially. He has mixing credits on that killer third disc of <i>DFA Compilation #2</i>, co-spins with Tim Goldsworthy and James Murphy around New York, and works regularly at APT, arguably the city's last great venue for dance music.</p><p>
    Sweeney's shows are archived and downloadable as MP3, but <i>Rvng Prsnts Mx3</i> is his first official CD release. The mix doesn't pack the surprises of Sweeney's radio sets, and the tracklisting's not nearly as risky, but Sweeney compromises with more delicate beat- and mood-matching. While other dilettante acts like 2 Many DJs and Optimo sell themselves with abrupt genre jumps and cheeky mash-ups, Sweeney is far more selfless, keeping the tracks in the limelight with thoughtful sequences. Manuel Göttsching's <i>E2-E4</i> begins the first half of <i>Mx3</i>, then is put under the scalpel. Dropping Aphex Twin (""bbydhyonchord""), UNKLE (a remix of Can's ""Vitamin C""), and Radiohead (""Kid A"") after it, Sweeney examines the monumental 1984 recording's influences, nodding at the same time to some of <i>E2-E4</i>'s own touchstones: Kraftwerk (""Numbers"") and synth-pop (Tones On Tail's ""Performance"").</p><p>
    By now Sweeney's impressed us; midway through, he just wants us to dance-- though not without a brilliant conceit. Mutant disco (Was Not Was' ""Wheel Me Out"", Yoko Ono's ""Walking On Thin Ice"") butts heads with techno legend Carl Craig (""Climax""), whose rubberfunk is chaser for Mu's sewer slime (""Let's Get Sick""), but in the end they're all servile to Sweeney's elaborate song title wordplay: ""Kick in the eye. Wheel me out. Walking in the rain. Walking on thin ice. Let's get sick. Painless. Climax. Free."" The joke nails Sweeney better than I can.</p></div>"|7801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7801-rvng-prsnts-mx3/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

The hip-hop producer's latest joint of 3 a.m. gutter-steamed grooves simultaneously hypnotizes me into a trance and makes me fidget and cringe out of restlessness. Consider it a hip-hop equivalent of sexually frustrated, adolescent foreplay.</p><p>
    Take ""Glowing"", a reason for living, number 210. A swaying, miles-deep bassline that demands call-in radio shoutouts to people who never met and neighborhoods that want you to stay out, opens the track, while a timeless soul piano melody softens a beat so crisp that it can break in half. These three elements are noble qualities but when the same six bars are repeated for more than five minutes, it is a chore.</p><p>
    It can also leave a listener anticipating events that will never happen. The best minimalism always draws out the most from the slightest gestures; in hip-hop, such instrumentation demands an MC to fill in the gaps. <i>The Surviving Elements</i> is a half-full glass, but there are still some prime breaks for DJs, as well as soundtracks for mating rituals that involve free booze, secondhand smoke, and a library-full of humanity's timeless clichés.</p><p>
    Pete Rock is best known for progressing hip-hop's love affair with jazz in his 1992 hit with C.L. Smooth, ""They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)"". Since then, our man has been an underground icon, delivering topnotch productions for ego-centric MCs. His ear catches the latent hypnosis found in funk at its best as his picks of rare basement 45s attests in BBE's <i>Funk Spectrum Vol.3</i> comp. <i>The Surviving Elements</i> is a collection of B-side instrumentals from last year's album of hip-hop grown from Brooklyn's weed patches, <i>The Soul Survivor II</i>.</p><p>
    Opener ""You Remind Me"" is a remix of Al Green's hypnotic classic, ""Let's Stay Together"", where Rock strips everything down to the mama's heartbeat, traces of an orchestra, and the Reverend's choked sighs. It's a near-perfect DJ break to be remixed, beat-juggled and crab-scratched. ""U Are What U Are"" is another Motown number chopped to the knees, where a diva belts out the track's from a Chitlin Circuit soul-45 and is repeated like a string-pulled toy. ""Hop, Skip &amp; Jump"" and ""(Pimp) Strut"" are decent meat-market fodder with a karate-chopped, electric-guitar tone and piecemeal electro-funk synths. Less successful minimalism is the tepid, baby oil-stained, softporn R&amp;B; of ""Midnight and You"" and the shopping mall Muzakbox that duels with a ring-a-ding-ding cosmic-zap in ""Fairground"".</p><p>
<i>Surviving</i>'s best moment is ""Hip 2 Hip"", a 22nd century space-funk tune that causes glass-domed cities to arise from those Brooklyn weedpatches. There is bliss for the first two minutes, and then comes the nagging feeling that something should happen. Futurism indeed.</p></div>"|6903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6903-the-surviving-elements-from-the-soul-survivor-ii-sessions/|6.8|Cameron Macdonald

Adam Green, whose Moldy
    Peaches once seemed consigned to <em>I Love the 00s</em> oblivion
    alongside 2001 novelties like bipartisanship and <em>Zero Wing</em>,
    seems to have noticed. On <em>Gemstones</em>, Green ditches the string
    flourishes of 2003's <em>Friends of Mine</em> and dips into Richman's
    quirky-pop-classicist oeuvre as if it were the anti-folk fountain of
    youth. Make that a porcelain throne, as Green also scraps Richman's
    defining naïvete in favor of his own musical essences: toilet humor,
    pharmaceuticals, and hipster poses.</p><p>
    Green's self-consciously dweeby vocals hang his off-kilter lyrics like
    a doomed curveball. We're supposed to see how clever he is when he
    invokes celebrities' names or naughty images. Occasionally, he gets his
    giggles, usually with stream-of-consciousness imagery about
    ""blank-faced footprints of the zebras in the glen"" or non sequiturs
    like ""her lips taste just like Sun Chips."" Nearly as often, though,
    Green is just the average schmuck with cool friends who mistakenly
    thinks he's the life of the party. Politics aside, Bush-bashing ""Choke
    on a Cock"" is boring. ""Carolina"" exists for its rhyme with ""vagina.""
    Crackhouses and cock-biting prostitutes also rear their proverbial
    heads, titillating would-be indie kids (I just said ""tit""). As far as
    I know, a clunker describing ""the boy with the sterilized pitchfork""
    isn't about us.</p><p>
    Prolificacy can be a curse, and 15 roughly interchangeable songs all
    clocking in between 1 and 3 minutes doesn't help Green's cause. While
    his arrangements-- relying largely on acoustic guitar and organs --
    mostly plunder Richman's simple aesthetic, Green's melodies plumb a
    deeper well, from Brian Wilson to Kurt Weill. In fact, occasionally
    Green forgets his loveable iconoclast persona and apes the best-known
    band to cover Weill's ""Alabama Song"", particularly during the ""L.A.
    Woman""-tinged breakdown that closes ""Over the Sunrise"". Coming soon: a
    cover of Jim Morrison's ""Lament for My Cock"".</p><p>
    What about Green's health? Sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll are just all
    right with me, but the man can't let a song go by without mentioning
    mind-altering substances, from coffee and vodka tonics to Xanax,
    Zoloft, ""drugstore dreams"" and a man who writes prescriptions on
    Post-It notes. ""Refill my prescription until next time,"" Green
    requests on another song, the aforementioned ""Carolina"" (vagina!).
    Given the right meds myself, I could tell you this theme constitutes a
    trenchant analysis of our pill-popping society as we hurtle toward a
    brave new dystopian tomorrow. But that's bullshit.</p><p>
    Green comes armed with paradoxical praise from Julian Casablancas:
    ""He's eccentric and down to earth."" So is Richman, still rock rock
    rockin' ""Government Center"". But Richman's cult fame lives on for a
    reason: He means it. With Green, that's never been clear.</p></div>"|3627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3627-gemstones/|5.5|Marc Hogan

That statement may sound overly romantic, but it's rooted in practical truth: like dance music, his sexed-up blues worked on the principle that the repitition of a complex rhythm will induce a trancelike state in listeners as their minds surrender to their dancing bodies.</p><p>
    
    Kimbrough's music was an utterly unique form of boogie blues, created and developed at his juke joint in Chulahoma, Miss., where he played for decades before being ""discovered,"" which is like saying the New World was discovered by Columbus and not by the millions of Native Americans already inhabiting the continent. In that venue-- which burned to the ground in 2000, two years after his death-- his music must have elicited a visceral thrill, one lost in the translation to digital media. Even muted on disk, however, his riffs still sound somehow inhuman supernatural, as if he can only channel their infinite wavelength for a few minutes at a time.</p><p>
    
    More than the lyrics or the melodies, it's Kimbrough's riffs that the 15 artists are covering on Fat Possum's tribute <i>Sunday Nights: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough</i>. Each artist has a slightly different approach producing wildly varying results, commensurate with the wide range of styles they represent. Some use the blues rhythms as jumping-off points, placing only secondary emphasis on the words. The chugging guitar pattern on Spiritualized's rendering of ""Sad Days Lonely Nights"" sounds like a perpetual-motion machine: self-propelled and apparently accelerating. That riff quickly becomes the backdrop for a sustained freak-out similar to the band's own ""Cop Shoot Cop"", although, mercifully, not as long.</p><p>
    
    Other artists cover their songs holistically, giving each element equal weight. Thee Shams' ""Release Me"" resets Kimbrough's song in a museum-quality re-creation of 60s swamp pop, and the Black Keys' elegant ""My Mind Is Ramblin'"" simmers mysteriously, with Dan Auerbach using a guitar/amp set-up identical to Kimbrough's. And while the name Pete Yorn usually doesn't inspire consumer confidence, he transforms ""I Feel Good Again"" into a shamelessly catchy pop song.</p><p>
    
    Not every interpretation pulls so much from its source material. The Ponys, Outrageous Cherry, and Whitey Kirst all submit uninspired blues-rock exercises, which weigh down the second half of the album. The vocals by Entrance's Guy Blakeslee on ""Do the Romp"" sound arch and self-conscious, especially compared to Cat Power's soulful performance. And ""Done Got Old"" gets two treatments-- from Jim White and the Heartless Bastards-- both of which sound lightweight, as if neither artist has the age or experience to grasp Kimbrough's mortal resignation.</p><p>
<i>Sunday Nights</i> begins and ends with Iggy and the Stooges, who toured with Kimbrough before his death, performing ""You Better Run"". The first version is a sped-up blues-rock number that perfectly translates Kimbrough's riff to the Stooges' guitar-drenched frenzy; the second is slowed-down and, with Mike Watt's bass bouncing steadily, much more faithful to the original. Both versions feature deranged vocals from Pop. In the song, a woman approaches the singer  and asks for a ride home, saying there's a man with a knife who wants to rape her. Halfway home, Pop snarls, ""you might still get raped, baby,"" to which she replies, ""oh, you don't have to rape me, Mr. Pop. 'Cause I love you."" Compared to Kimbrough's original, which underplayed the sexual predation hauntingly, Pop and the Stooges play the song as a lark, making an unsettling singalong out of ""Rape you, baby.""</p><p>
    
    However, Pop's seemingly cavalier take reveals a subtle table-turning: in the end the song implies that the threatened woman has been in control all along, launching a sly, manipulative seduction of the narrator. She is the story's true predator, and he is both her prize and her dupe. While they still raise some very uncomfortable questions, these two versions of ""You Better Run"" prove to be brave, audacious reimaginings that expose the dark heart of the song as well as the intricacies of meaning in all of Kimbrough's work. Of the <i>Sunday Nights</i> contributors, Iggy and the Stooges seem to have the most intuitive grasp of the man and his music. Without stooping to romanticize Kimbrough, they reveal his songs to be more than simply the sum of their riffs, melodies, and lyrics; in their hands-- as in Kimbrough's-- they're dark and mystifying forces.</p></div>"|2061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2061-sunday-nights-the-songs-of-junior-kimbrough/|7.0|Stephen M.

    But nobody outside of music school gearhead bands says they're influenced by Naked City.</p><p>
    Over a decade since their breakup, Naked City still looms over composer and saxman John Zorn's catalog.  Yet compared to his other major 
    working band, Masada, Naked City has remarkably little sway over Zorn's work now, and this box set-- which collects all seven of the group's albums, released between 1989 to 1993-- forms a puzzling legacy.  Masada produced a songbook that Zorn has exploited across two dozen records; a chunk of Naked City's material was covers, and the rest died with the band.  Masada celebrates his immersion in his Jewish heritage; Naked City emerged at a time of hostility and deep stress in Zorn's life, and half the album covers showed corpses and body parts.</p><p>
    Most people know Naked City from their only American release, the self-titled debut on Nonesuch.  Every time I move into a new place-- even before I cart in the boxes-- I set up a stereo and blast that LP in the living room: It cleans out the evil spirits and even clears out bad smells. On <i>Naked City</i>, Zorn introduced an amped-up surf/lounge/punk band featuring downtown New York's biggest talents, who blast and din through the ""James Bond"" theme song, the theme to <i>Chinatown</i>, and a sound portrait of New Orleans' Latin Quarter-- and then right when they slip into a groove, out of nowhere, the band launches punishing blasts of noise and catastrophe, flaming wreckage that blows up and collapses on a dime.</p><p>
    The vigorous rhythm section of Fred Frith on bass and Zorn's cerebellum, Joey Baron on drums, backed Wayne Horvitz and Bill Frisell on keys and guitar, genre chameleons who each brought a sonic bestiary to Zorn's arrangements.  (The band is almost unthinkable without a guitarist as unique yet accommodating as Frisell.)  And sharing the frontline with Zorn's own nasal alto sax squalls was part-time sixth member Yamatsuka Eye of the Boredoms, the star vocalist who brought a thousand screams to the hardcore tracks.  For a fun art exercise, try to sketch what the inside of Eye's throat must look like based only on how it sounds.  Don't cheat!</p><p>
    But Naked City the band differs from Naked City as a conceptual project, and over their next few albums Zorn pulled them into every possible direction.  Following the band in the early 90s meant chasing down Japanese imports that grew more unpredictable and withdrawn over time, and rather than building on the band's successes, the discs felt like a bank of unconnected lab experiments that were each searching for the biggest bang.</p><p>
    For example, on <i>Heretic</i>, they broke off into duets and trios to perform short freely improvisations. It's their weakest effort, because most of the guys understood free improv but weren't really in love with it.  (The best cuts are Zorn's duets with Eye, including ""Here Come the 7,000 Frogs"".)  The one long piece on <i>Leng Tch'e</i> features droning guitar tones that run at excruciating/ecstatic durations, pulling the flesh of your chest until Zorn and Eye come in to twist your nipples.  And <i>Absinthe</i>, their final disc, is a haunted palace of distant ambient pieces that turn the players into unrecognizable clouds of sound: chains drag and long tones ring out of the mist, in passages that are so spring-wound and intentionless that you wonder if the instruments are groaning while the band has left the building.</p><p>
<i>Grand Guignol</i>, the band's masterpiece, comes in three sections, separated like wings of a museum.  The title piece opens the album with a seventeen-minute creepshow of menacing sounds and flashes of violence; in the middle section, Zorn pays homage to modern composers like Ives, Scriabin, and Messiaen; and that's followed, as if because shit just got too quiet, by 34 cuts of their patented ""thrash jazz.""</p><p>
    Zorn's trademark move involved juxtaposing unrelated styles at breakneck speed, an effect often compared to spinning a radio dial.  (See 
    ""Speedfreaks"" for the best example and ""N. Y. Flat Top Box"" for the funniest.)  In concert, these hardcore minatures drove crowds into the mosh pit, but the studio reveals that these were meticulous compositions.  The genius of putting thrash jazz pieces on <i>Grand Guignol</i> actually wasn't to contrast them with the contemporary classical pieces; it was to compare them and highlight their meticulous construction-- even as the performers hammer them out with a bloodthirst.  Zorn was making post-modern art with the release of a primal scream.</p><p>
<i>Radio</i>, the second to last album, almost brought them back full circle to their debut; it starts out sleek and cool like a 60s Cali car chase movie, before it comes unglued in the second half in a metal/punk/funk pastiche.  It's intriguing, but it's also clinical: The kitsch is studious, and even on tunes like ""Surfer Girl"" and ""Party Girl"", the band sounds like they can't take off because they're waiting for a cue to switch to something else.</p><p>
    That record also marks the point where Naked City wore out its greatest trick: Zorn crossed the ideas on paper, but he no longer synthesized them in action.  Ten years after these albums, critics and fans are still shocked when a jazz artist makes an unexpected album-- for example, when Matthew Shipp uses beats and samples, or Cecil Taylor gigs with Thurston Moore.  These transgressions look minor next to Zorn's, but the artists can surprise us because they defy our expections of <em>them</em>: they built an identity, and the diversions have meaning.  Zorn had worn out that option.  Nothing that Naked City could do-- bluegrass, Mexicali, opera-- would have surprised anyone.  As an artist, Zorn had turned into a radio.</p><p>
    Although the chilly detachment of <i>Absinthe</i> actually made their last album more effective, it's easy to believe they were out of juice, and 
    aside from a few reunion gigs, that was the end of the band.  Naked City will always be Zorn's ""coolest"" project, the best vehicle for his early ideas, and one of the most intriguing ensembles its members ever joined.  And now, Zorn can inter it in a single box and once again set it aside.</p></div>"|5911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5911-the-complete-studio-recordings/|8.5|Chris Dahlen

Can you imagine the FDA approving a drug whose frequent side effects include increased heart rate, inability to think straight, sweating, stammering, and loss of judgment? In the past that might have been difficult, but today it doesn't seem so far-fetched. Outrageous Cherry offer love in packet form on the cover of their latest album, <i>Our Love Will Change the World</i>, an image that together with the album title forms a sort of obtuse pun that's nevertheless fairly clever.</p><p>
    
    The album itself offers packets of a different kind: Two-to-three minute packets of sugary retropop that swings to the beat of the 1960s, finding middle ground between sloppy psych, Spector reverb, <i>Nuggets</i> garage punk, and the syncopated stomp of Motown, which is coincidentally also the Cherry's hometown. It's nice to hear them so effortlessly kick out a concise, instantly appealing batch of melodious songs again-- they experimented with conceptual themes and running the clock a little too long on 2002's <i>The Book of Spectral Projections</i> and indulged in more acidic psych on last year's <i>Supernatural Equinox</i>. Drummer Carey Gustafson has that slapping Funk Brothers beat down pat, and the melodies tumble from lead Cherry Matthew Smith's head with an urgency unheard since 1999's masterful <i>Out There in the Dark</i>. That's still the band's best album, but <i>Our Love</i> is certainly a worthy successor.</p><p>
    
    A return to straight-up, ecstatic pop bliss is immediately evident: Opener ""Pretty Girls Go Insane"" has harmonica wailing over stomping drums as Smith's trumpet blasts a fanfare for the common confused lover. Smith's mild, smooth-toned tenor is a perfect counterpoint to Larry Ray's fuzzy guitar leads, and the layered male/female harmonies on the unexpected breakdown near the end build tension nicely for the finale, when the harmonica wails back into the mix. They run the gamut elsewhere from the pummeling pop explosion of ""Unless"" to the lilting midtempo goo of ""Why Don't We Talk About Something Else"" and from the title track to the melancholy balladeering of ""You're a Reflection of Infinite Chaos"", whose relative lack of reverb only makes the heartbreaking coda all the more crushing.</p><p>
    
    When Gustafson and new bassist Courtney Sheedy join Smith for some Vermont maple harmonies on ""What have You Invented Today?"", the stars align. That sticky song is the greatest kind of escapist pop singalong: It's not the kind of thing that will change the world, but it's a mighty good time.</p></div>"|6063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6063-our-love-will-change-the-world/|7.7|Joe Tangari

As with his work in Tortoise and Isotope 217, Parker's playing as a bandleader is virtually egoless, and on <i>The Relatives</i> he remains steadfast in his willingness to temper and subordinate his instrument's voice in the broader interests of the group at large.</p><p>
    
    Such cooperative benevolence would seem misplaced if Parker hadn't the wherewithal to surround himself with such sympathetic players. Joining him here is his regular rhythm section of drummer Chad Taylor and bassist Chris Lopes (both of whom played on Parker's 2003 debut as headliner, <i>Like-Coping</i>) as well as Sam Barsheshet on Fender Rhodes and Wurlitzer. Here, the quartet move in a loose-limbed, baggy lockstep, with each member given an equal place at the table. If you were to approach this album blindfolded, you might easily assume Taylor or Barsheshet to be the ringmaster, so humbly does Parker deliver his sparklingly clean, unfussy guitar contributions.</p><p>
    
    Significantly less abstract and more song-oriented than many of Parker's past recordings (particularly noise-laden improv experiments such as <i>Out Trios, Vol. 2</i>, his 2003 collaboration with Kevin Drumm and Michael Zerang), on <i>The Relatives</i> he also shares songwriting duties with his bandmates, as well as tackling an ambitious cover of Marvin Gaye's ""When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You"". The album opens with the laidback swank of Taylor's ""Istanbul"", where Parker's breezy acoustic guitar and Barsheshet's organ laze about sunning themselves on the rocks, before the driving, almost Meters-like R&amp;B; fusion of ""Mannerisms"" arrives to shake them from their idyll. The melodic riffling of Lopes' ""Sea Change"" explores some of the same dusky film noir shadows that Tortoise haunted early in their lifespan, while on the title track Barsheshet conjures up a shimmering, humid glaze from the keyboards in a manner that fondly recalls Herbie Hancock's <i>Sextant</i>.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, there are occasions when the group skirt dangerously close to the same easy-listening tar pits that have ensnared so many post-rock fusionists. When Lopes introduces a flute on the turtleneck-clad jazz-pop of ""Beanstalk"", you may fear that you've inadvertently stumbled across Anchorman's Ron Burgundy playing an after-hours set down at the supper club. Thankfully, however, such missteps are few, and over the bulk of <i>The Relatives</i> these musicians sound positively ecstatic to be playing with and for each other (if one is to trust the large number of animated hollers they give one another during the course of the album). If you grant them some attention, I expect you'll find their enthusiasm to be infectious.</p></div>"|6561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6561-the-relatives/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

    Dave Porter (aka Avey Tare) and Black Dice's Eric Copeland. On
    <i>Blasted</i>, these roomies pull from a sonic palette that wholly evokes their <i>nom de
    feedback</i> and fashion a 33-minute subterranean landscape of
    gargling mud baths inhabited by the robotic chirps of rusted aviary
    grubs. The album displays less joyful humanity/beauty than Animal
    Collective's Beach-Boy campfire jams and swivels less raucously than
    early day Black Dice; pinpointing an ambient equator, it loosely
    resembles <i>Danse Manatee</i> dry humping <i>Beaches &amp; Canyons</i>.</p><p>
    
    Looking outside the band's apartment complex, they're closest to the criminally
    forgotten Vancouver noise crew Pork Queen-- well, if those Canadians reformed to cover swatches
    of Throbbing Gristle sauerkraut, extracting porno evil, and presenting
    preternatural industrial howl as pedestrian video game music. OK, it doesn't really sound that cool; much of <i>Blasted</i> conjures wordy imagery but feels sluggish,
    lacking the liveliness of Porter/Copeland's main projects.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Gorilla In The Woods"" bequeaths a
    drowning sailor's glug to guitar-like creaking, depth-buried
    entropic repetitions, sprung rhythm, and reverb katydid swirls. If
    commissioned by Nintendo, imagine digital grubs eating ones-and-zeros
    roots. The track ends with humanoid bird caws and laughter of its
    participants, hosing off the anonymity of what came before it.</p><p>
    
    ""Our
    Single"" is drumpad plus buried vocals, and it equals an auto-asphyxiated
    Xiu Xiu suffocating inside a house of cellophane. ""West Indian Day
    Parade"" samples the event that gave it a name, but the low hum of
    celebratory language and spicy vegetable patties are inter-spliced
    with a marching band jump cut into a typewriting Burroughs fusion.
    ""Heavy Angel""'s rumbling percussion has the same soft corners as
    ""Gorilla in the Woods"" and really, this is all very gentle, somehow
    submerged and cushioned, a game of padded Pong played by termites. In addition to the titled compositions, there are a handful of
    untitled maggot granules begging listeners to loop/expand elsewhere:
    clock chiming and/or unwinding, loose cables spelling ""SOS"", a
    sand-dollar concertina stuck in the receding ocean jetsam.</p><p>
    
    But let's put it in perspective: Terrestrial Tones is often referred to in reviews as a ""super group"" but although Porter and Copeland are in popular bands,
    they're also roommates; and as any musician who's lived with other
    musicians knows, each music house supports about 30,000 bands
    depending on the night and who's around. So instead of naively reading
    <i>Blasted</i> as a meeting of indie-rock power brokers, it helps to strip
    away the distance and funnel the sounds through the framework of two
    friends getting together in the comfort of their own home and putting
    some fairly modest abstractions to tape.</p><p>
    
    Still, despite its low-key nature, <i>Blasted</i> is certainly Psych-o-Path's
    highest profile album to date, though the New York City label's
    released stronger work including two <i>Space Is No Place</i> Big Apple noise
    samplers and the shimmering, often painfully beautiful stringed
    buzz-quake of SF trio Axolotl's eponymous debut. Especially impressive
    is Mouthus' locked-groove of a self-titled debut, which along with
    <i>Loam</i>, a mesmerizing follow-up just released by Ecstatic Peace!,
    establishes the scruffy NYC duo as the most combustible new-school
    heirs to Dead C's free-range soft-black feedback (as reinvigorated by
    Lighting Bolt's punky broke-drum tribalism). But whatever, if it takes
    Terrestrial Tones' middling underwater cricket opera to put
    Psych-o-Path on the map then Copeland and Porter should rest well
    knowing they've transcended the skeletal patchiness of this fun but
    undistinguished offering.</p></div>"|8281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8281-blasted/|5.7|Brandon Stosuy

I love their unpredictability, how they insouciantly break with songs' often grid-like verse-chorus-verse panelling. Being struck by one is like venturing beneath 4th street for the first time and finding yourself suddenly deep in quaint, snarled Lower Manhattan, or like discovering a hidden package behind the tree on Christmas morning when you'd given up on getting that Red Rider BB gun. The unexpected detours on Archer Prewitt's new album <i>Wilderness</i> are even better: Rather than simply disregarding convention, Prewitt ingratiates his off-the-beaten-path escapades-- two-minute bridges, codas, and codas of codas-- into coherent form, and the resulting songs are fluid and virtuosic.</p><p>
    
    This prodigiousness may come as a surprise to those familiar with Prewitt's work. While the Sea and Cake contributor and Chicago denizen has released four accomplished solo albums since 1997, he's never before experimented as confidently with spiraling song structures or adventurous instrumental adornment, and he's seldom approached such heights. The consistency of <i>Wilderness</i>' eleven songs is almost overwhelming. Pick a track: Buried amid a complex topography of busy yet buoyant orchestration and sundry subtleties you're sure to find a sterling hook that would probably sound great even if it were handled fecklessly.</p><p>
    
    Dusting off the ashes of 2002's coarser <i>Three</i>, opener ""Way of the Sun"" steals in on a babbling bell melody. Unassumingly, Prewitt joins the fray, strumming and singing as if nothing much has changed-- it's just another humble singer-songwriter album. Out of nowhere comes a titanic, vaguely Dylan-esque chorus-- as memorable and articulate as anything Prewitt has ever done-- and it all comes into focus. Then, a lithe bridge flows in almost like an afterthought-- the first of the album's many dazzling, unforeseen twists.</p><p>
    
    ""Leaders"" starts routinely and grows more unconventional with every turn: The song's exceptional chorus is buffered by a stately harpsichord lick. Then the track slows as Prewitt reasserts the chorus at two-thirds speed before tacking on a tiptoeing Dark Side of the Moon coda. ""O, KY"" turns the trick even better, processing a bouncy, shuffled intro before deciding it would rather be plaintive and bittersweet. Stiffening up and straightening out, the track performs a wild about-face, running through a couple of nervy verses before regrouping for a dramatic finale that puts most prolix rock bands' best riffage and structural histrionics to shame. ""Think Again"" is <i>Wilderness</i>' darkest song; it also implicates Prewitt's role in the Sea and Cake-- though the song takes just as much of its dusky, open-air vibe from Thrill Jockey brethren Tortoise's <i>TNT</i>.</p><p>
    
    Part of <i>Wilderness</i>' charm is its trembling near-composure: Prewitt doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve. Rather, he lets his emotions seep out in brief moments of vulnerability before thinking better of it and curling back up. On ""Cheap Rhyme"", his vocal snarling is almost flagrant amid so much modesty. True to form, the song funnels out into a regal, horn-driven bridge, but not before Prewitt's weakness becomes apparent. He can't belt, but <i>Wilderness</i> is almost better for it: Although Prewitt doesn't possess James Mercer's earth-shattering tenor or A.C. Newman's hand at pop hooks, those limitations have only led him down a more carefully considered-- and more interesting-- route. His struggle to circumvent has earned him one of the most idiosyncratic and captivating voices in songwriting, and <i>Wilderness</i> is his most focused solo effort yet.</p></div>"|6470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6470-wilderness/|8.5|Sam Ubl

With Southern and Midwestern rappers rising to prominence over the past few years, the birthplace of hip-hop has only constituted about a third of rap radio playlists.  But the article's unspoken question was: What's going on with the West?  A pie chart showed that California rappers only constituted around 3% of those same playlists-- a far cry from the early 90s, when Dr. Dre, 2pac, and Snoop Dogg all but owned the
    rap landscape.  Since then, 2pac's been gunned down, Snoop and Ice Cube have fallen off hard, and DJ Quik and the Bay Area scene have had little success breaking through to the mainstream.  Dre's kept his name in circulation by producing Eminem and 50 Cent-- but even he hasn't released material under his own name since 1999, constantly delaying the release of his supposed masterpiece, <i>Detox</i>.</p><p>
    So The Game, Dre's newest protégé, has a lot riding on him.  The Compton MC made a name for himself on the mixtape scene that made 50 Cent a star; it made perfect sense for him to become the first West Coast representative of G-Unit.  And having spent the past few months embroiled in pointless beefs with also-rans like Joe Budden and Yukmouth-- and getting hammered from all sides-- Game needs more than ever to deliver a debut to back up his talk.</p><p>
    Now he has: <i>The Documentary</i> is the best West Coast street-rap album since DJ Quik's 2002 LP <i>Under tha Influence</i>.  All of the G-Unit solo albums thus far have been aesthetically unified, a rarity in hip-hop; the tracks on <i>The Documentary</i> actually sound like they belong on the same album.  Dre produces five of the album's 17 songs, applying his recent stripped-down cinematic style, and many of the record's other producers follow his lead.  Superstar beatmakers like Timbaland and Kanye West hold back on their signature tics, fitting their usual approaches into the album's fabric.  The end result is a rich, triumphant sonic tapestry; you can hear every dollar that went into it.</p><p>
    The Game is not a particularly singular rapper.  His hoarse, guttural voice doesn't possess any of the relaxed menace of classic West Coast rappers; he sounds more like Tha Dogg Pound member Daz Dillinger than Eazy or Snoop or The D.O.C.  He has an appealing confidence and an unforced lyrical toughness, though: ""I spit for the niggas doing 25 on they fifth year, ready to throw a nigga off the fifth tier/ For the white boys in the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, yeeah/ And every nigga who helped me to get here,"" he rhymes on the dramatic and brutally hard Just Blaze banger ""Church for Thugs"".  Unfortunately, he also frequently sounds awkward on hooks, seemingly
    hoping that simply repeating the same phrases a few times will suffice.  In fact, many of the best tracks are the ones on which 50 steps in to deliver the hook, like the bananas single ""How We Do"", where 50 pushes the music-box Dre beat perfectly.</p><p>
    Throughout the album, Game seems obsessed with his place in rap history, constantly name-checking Dre and Eazy-E; on ""Dreams"", he spits, ""The dream of Erik Wright, that's what I'm giving you/ Who walked through the White House without a business suit/ Compton hat, jheri curl dripping on Ronald Reagan's shoes.""  But the impeccable beats and The Game's authoritative gruffness carry him through the album; he never sounds like anything less than a star on the rise.  Only at the album's end, however, does he reveal his greatest gift: a powerful, heartfelt vulnerability.  On ""Like Father, Like Son"", the album's final track, he tells of the birth of his son.  Over Needlez' melodramatic, string-laden track, he raps, ""Nose, ears, eyes, chin just like your daddy/ I'll die before you grow up and be just like your daddy.""  Same rhyme or not, it lends a stark humanity to Game's sometimes empty braggadocio.</p></div>"|3663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3663-the-documentary/|8.3|Tom Breihan

The first track and indulgence of this session, ""Tremelo"", seethes for more than eight minutes, building from the titular guitar treatment echoing against itself to the full band working up a frothy sludge where the line between live performance and pre-recorded tape segments blur. The second, ""Youth of America"", tips the scales at 6:40. It's a cover of a Wipers song on which its songwriter Greg Sage claimed: ""many radical recording techniques [were]...used to bring [the song a] frantic realism.""</p><p>Astute listeners will notice that Sage's radical recording techniques eerily mirror the loop work former Burma member Martin Swope inserted into MoB's songs. Interestingly, Burma excises Sage's trippy loop chicanery from their cover, distilling the propulsive barn-burning fury from the original's grand punk meandering. Instead, Roger Miller's frantic vocals are treated with an apocryphal echo, and his guitar wrangling strikes a similarly anthemic pose. Throughout ""Snapshot"", Miller proves adept at playing the instrument as a musical tool as well as using it as a noise device, treating feedback and distortion with the same respectful disdain that a <em>Guitar World</em> coverboy would show an arpeggio and a hammer-on solo. But I digress.</p><p> Prescott's ""Absent Mind"" was the only new track essayed during this eight-song session. After its song-part ends-- you know, the verse-chorus stuff-- comes four minutes of vamping that accurately mirrors one's mind going AWOL. Miller makes like a guitar hero yet again, Clint Conley holds down the fort as best he can with his bounding bass work, and Prescott scats across his drumkit while screaming about being master of his domain and nothing ever going his way. Eventually, the stumbling and bumbling ceases, and the small crowd gathered in the studio applaud.</p><p> It's disingenuous of me to call the ""Absent Mind"" outro ""stumbling and bumbling"" as if it were some extended goof that just happened to coalesce into something useful. If <em>Snapshot</em> serves any purpose, it proves that Mission of Burma have live chops-- even though the group is only two years removed from a 19-year hiatus. Of course, the topic of Burma's inexplicable return to stage and studio is well-worn: post-punk pioneers ignored in their heyday return to active duty two decades later as standard-bearers for a growing group of fans and peers, and yadda yadda yadda, they don't suck. Still, it's not everyday that a rock group performs a concert with an opening act that named themselves after one of the headliner's albums.</p><p> In light of Burma's unavoidable influence, the pomp and circumstance that heralded their return was warranted, and a long time coming-- think of the ""Inexplicable Tour"" (the handful of reunion shows Burma played in 2002) as a long-awaited victory lap, and the recording of and touring behind their 2004 LP <em>ONoffON</em> as the post-victory spoils. Those two events served, in a sense, as the culmination of all the work Burma put into their music, along with all the music the members created outside of it. Now, after that glorious hoohah comes the part of the story where this highly influential, widely lauded bastion of rock music sets aside the accolades and adulation and goes back to making music simply for the sake of making music. And this is where <em>Snapshot</em> comes in.</p><p> The second definition of ""snapshot""-- the one that doesn't tie in with a highly-quotable Burma lyric-- is ""an isolated observation"". So consider <em>Snapshot</em> in that light: The songs chosen for this session might not be the most well-known of Burma's career-- there's no ""Revolver"" or ""Academy Fight Song"" (usually found, in live settings, riding the coattails of ""Max Ernst"")-- but they're representative of the group at this point in time. The session's opening three songs exemplify the group's inquisitive, exploratory nature, while ""Red"", ""Dirt"", and especially ""That's How I Escaped My Certain Fate"" are straight-forward sorties that pull no punches. ""Certain Fate"", in particular, sounds remarkably similar to the version recorded on <em>Vs.</em> last century. Conley nonchalantly announces the song title before the group charges straight into the track, with his vocals (""This might be!/ Your only chance!"") hitting the same frenetic notes found on the original cut. It's a remarkable performance.</p><p> In concert, it's difficult to miss the tape looper Bob Weston's contributions, even if he's stationed out of sight behind the mixing board. However, on the new record, his presence is seamlessly integrated into the fabric of the songs. He loops the delirious ping-ponging dada chant at the end of ""Max Ernst"", he throws back the ""oooh wee oooh""'s of ""Red"" at varying speeds during the bombastic climax, and he plays Roger Miller against himself near the end of ""Tremelo"". Weston's best works, however, can be found in ""Mica"", the group's best performance from this session.</p><p>  Fans will undoubtedly remember the beginning of this song: the five-note guitar figure, a tweaked version of the <em>Close Encounters</em> motif, played slowly at first, then played a little faster, then faster, then faster, until the drums hop on board and the song zips off. Weston adds a distorted brassy wheezing noise that sounds like a slowed-down train whistle. Combined with Miller's increasingly faster playing, this loop ably complements the track's locomotive introduction.</p><p> As on the recorded version, Conley's vocals are spit back at him backwards as the band stabs their way through the song. At first, this second voice is barely discernible; the second time through, however, these reversed voices almost drown out Conley's actual voice, dressing the would-be patient detailed in these lyrics in damning clothes. When the musical chaos gives way to Prescott's tribal beating towards the end, this second voice continues jabbering, making the final question posed by the lyrics-- ""What could I say to that?""-- that much more poignant. And when the song finally comes to a shuddering halt, Weston brings back that distorted whistle one last time, signaling the end of this wild ride. In the hands of lesser talents, these tricks and trials would come off as overindulgent; in Burma's hands, they're masterful additions. Peter Prescott was taking the piss with his little aside, but he was spot on. Mission of Burma: never indulgent. And rarely better.</p></div>"|8985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8985-snapshot-ep/|8.2|David Raposa

By all accounts, <em>Folkloric Feel</em> is the product of Whiteman's crush on Cuban music, which he became drawn to while living for two months in Havana. A sharp, anxious intake of breath here is understandable-- culture jacking can produce laughable and even offensive results, and there's no friend you avoid with more diligence than the one who just returned from Scotland and insists on wearing a kilt to the bars.</p><p>
    
    But the much-ballyhooed Cuban flavor is subtle, a point of departure rather than a destination. Whiteman has shown admirable restraint in burying the borrowed culture deeply within the record's gliding, murky expressivity. It mainly rears its head in certain clattering polyrhythms-- which are a familiar staple of Broken Social Scene anyway-- and in the tactful use of the tres, a Cuban guitar-like instrument that looks like an overgrown mandolin, with three courses of two (or three, in the Puerto Rican variation) strings. The tres's plinking, arpeggio-friendly tone is a staple of the Apostle of Hustle sound, albeit one swathed in a surplus of Broken Social Scene-style distortion and striated atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    Besides the Cuban influence, Whiteman claims allegiance to Manu Chao, John Zorn, and ""the Ancestors and Mentors""-- an apparent reference to old-time  musicians and their longer attention span. A long attention span is a must for the title track, a nearly eight-minute long instrumental conversation that evolves so swiftly and complexly the listener feels rather dragged behind it like a muffler sparking on the pavement. It kicks off with a plucky, spiraling tres figure that recombines and ramifies over stark stabs of bass and rattling percussion that grows incrementally more clangorous, more Waitsian. A couple minutes in, a core melody has emerged, which is batted to and fro by call/response style organs and guitars. The evolution is so purposeful that it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when the song changes from baroque folk to a Broken Social Scene seether, and by the time it dilapidates, the poor melody has been battered through an overwhelming multiplicity of inflections and moods.</p><p>
    
    From here the album unfurls like a snapping gray flag: ""Sleepwalking Ballad"" is an up-tempo box step with flashes of grandeur when the melody intermittently shouts its theretofore tacit crescendo. ""Baby, You're in Luck"" finds Whiteman at his most Notwist, trading breathy, lovelorn lines with Amy Milan over a shuffling electro-blues track. ""Gleaning"" sounds of a piece with Clinic's <em>Walking With Thee</em>, with its gently humming organ and whispery, scatted vocals (which are pretty cool, except for one part when they get a little too forceful and begin to sound a little like the guy from Korn). And ""Dark is What I Want / Strutter's Ball"" is full-bore, swaggering space rock, inflected with a jazzy swing, and contains the record's only scorching guitar solo, which is impressively forceful juxtaposed with the more arcane maneuvers it nestles in.</p><p>
    
    By Whiteman's own admission, Apostle of Hustle is a sort of catchall for ideas that are too inscrutable or personal for his other projects. <em>Folkloric Feel</em> impresses itself on your consciousness slowly, by creeping degrees. The songs are mostly too fluid and multivalent to sum up with much fidelity; only the broadest gestures can be encapsulated, and the particulars get lost in the morass. You couldn't chart their changes and components with any more precision than you could a cloud as it moves imperturbably through the sky, and it's from this mutability that the record derives its peculiar appeal, moving in the blink of an eye from genial opacity to vivid bas-relief.</p></div>"|464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/464-folkloric-feel/|7.7|Brian Howe

There's nothing to ""get"": Wolf Eyes aren't laborious (they're merely prolific), and their music's not difficult (it's merely obtuse). This week, an eBay auction of the band's ultra-rare <i>Black Rat Floods</i> three-inch closed at well over $50. I haven't heard <i>BRF</i>, but my guess is standing inside the garage at the fucking Jiffy Lube would give me a pretty good idea. Fifty fucking dollars! Think about how many times you could have your oil changed for fifty dollars.</p><p>
    
    Completist fanaticism aside, I do love Wolf Eyes. For practical reasons really. Often I find myself in a situation where I just want to drown out everything happening around me-- maybe I'm reading, or sleeping, or listening to a new record-- and Wolf Eyes always complete the task. The band's countless limited runs are utterly faceless, but it's a good utterly faceless-- a Johnny Cash utterly faceless. If anything, what makes one Wolf Eyes record better than another-- and again, <i>Burned Mind</i> is in its own league-- is the sheer number of copies floating around (fuck aura). Three cheers for Wabana then, who by re-releasing <i>Fuck Pete Larsen</i> have made this 600-copy vinyl from 2002 the second, or fourth, or 20th best Wolf Eyes record to date.</p><p>
    
    Pete Larson (not ""Larsen"") is the guitarist in husband-wife duo 25 Suaves and the head of Michigan noise label Bulb Records. He released <i>Dread</i> and the band's early sevens and a twelve, but without speculating, it's unclear why Wolf Eyes thought Larson was such an asshole. The album's two 20 minute-plus slabs of fierce analog drones don't demand a backstory though, and in fact, they're kind enough at times to show their hand: Often with Wolf Eyes it's impossible to get through the thick curtain of post-processing to the band's supporting cast of instrumentation. Whether from cassette-to-vinyl-to-CD transfer woes or no mastering, the menacing high-end squeals are pushed back far enough for repeated and lengthy listens. With this sort of distance Wolf Eyes' brand of noise becomes less dangerous and more just plain adorable-- less wild tiger escaping from the zoo, more giant tortoise caring for a stray baby hippo. Both are crazy, but only a picture of the second hangs on my wall.</p></div>"|8731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8731-fuck-pete-larsen/|7.4|Nick Sylvester

    Blow-- recently mused in her blog about ""tiny particles of feelings.""
    It's as if emotions exist as microscopic units, she wrote, and these
    tiny emo-atoms can combine to form larger meanings. Sure enough, her
    previously cassette-only debut is chock-full of what she terms ""tiny
    touches."" But its fragile guitar fumblings and sex-deprived vocals
    mostly just add up to the primitive demo tape you might expect-- no
    emotional apotheoses here.</p><p>
    Unlike Maricich's recent salvoes into glitchy lap-pop (last year's
    <em>Poor Aim: Love Songs</em>) and slinky, Gorillaz-flavored beats
    (2003's <em>Concussive Caress</em>), <em>Everyday Examples of Humans
    Facing Straight Into the Blow</em> is a stripped-down affair. Maricich
    manages to make her beginner's acoustic guitar quirky and her anygirl
    vocals sweet, but those and a pair of corduroys (and a splash of
    piano) are all you get. And Phil Elvrum and Mirah don't swoop in to save the day, as
    they did on the Blow's <em>Bonus Album</em> EP.</p><p>
    What's left is often interesting-- in typically
    understated K Records fashion. The multitracked ""oh-oh"" harmonies that
    back a capella ""Why Don't You"" would probably turn into clipped,
    dance-y samples like those on <em>Poor Aim</em>'s ""The Love That I
    Crave"" if Maricich recorded them today. As they are, they
    nicely evoke the ocean she mentions in her lyrics, until tinny,
    distorted drums (the only percussion on the album) crash in like the
    surf against a rocky Olympic Coast cliff. The bucolic vision and folky
    strums of ""Milkmaid"" could wind up on the next Devendra
    Barnhart-curated compilation. ""That Boy"" brings out the touching
    innocence in quiet lust by exposing it as something universal, not
    perverse.</p><p>
    Still, many of Maricich's touches dissipate on frequent listens.
    Opener ""Oh Canada"" drowsily blends melodic elements from Rose
    Melberg's ""My Heaven, My Sky"", the traditional ""Danny Boy"", and Oasis's
    ""She's Electric""-- a pleasant mix, but hardly a memorable
    kickoff. Eagerly adolescent ""Tidalwave"" is the forgettable,
    tempo-jumping stepsister of ""Why Don't You"". The squeaky, arrhythmic
    chord changes of ""Surf Song"" give way to vaguely sexual moans, but
    somehow that fails to shock from an artist who says The Blow is just
    an easier way to pronounce Get the Hell Out of the Way of the Volcano,
    the moniker under which she originally released this collection.</p><p>
    Taken together, the tiny nano-feelings underlying Maricich's songs
    don't form a cohesive whole, but they do paint a picture of potential.
    Nothing here is as catchy or multifaceted as later compositions like
    ""What Tom Said About Girls"" or ""How Naked Are We Going to Get"", and
    that's a sign of Maricich's growth, not a knock against her. One
    cavil, though: The reissue trims the original's flowery, Moz-length
    song titles into hopelessly mundane clichés. ""My Heart Is Like a
    Savage, My Heart Would Like a Sausage"" becomes, uh, ""My Heart"".
    Emotional particles build better when they're not being chopped down.</p></div>"|813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/813-everyday-examples-of-humans-facing-straight-into-the-blow/|6.0|Marc Hogan

    For those of us most woefully afflicted, the answer of course is ""yes."" The music-- which I like to think remains more important than the objects-- makes itself part of your fiber through repeated listening, and indeed informs your personal composition, perhaps your philosophies and your picture of locales you've never been to, like Jamaica, Wales, or Brazil. One of the dozen or so albums that pushed me to that point was <i>The Holy Bible</i> by Manic Street Preachers. Being an American, the record was not easy for me to find, and I bought it at the first record convention I ever attended, in a ballroom at the Boston Radisson, for $9.98 plus tax. It was worth the search, and it quickly became a favorite.</p><p>
    
    Had I been British, the story would have been different, of course. The record hit No. 6 on the album chart and spawned three top 40 singles, while the band briefly occupied a side ring in the UK pop circus as lyricist Richey James-- notorious previously for carving ""4 Real"" into his arm on Steve Lamacq's BBC television show-- dropped completely off the face of the earth as the band neared completion of their follow-up, <i>Everything Must Go</i>. He still hasn't been found. In the intervening years, the band, as a trio, have become bona fide superstars in the UK, scoring back-to-back No. 1 albums and constantly turning up in those annoying UK rock mag features where about 80 otherwise respectable musicians are goaded to talk about whether they smoke after sex or how many times they've mooned the opposing side's fans at a football match, but when they made the album they were still hungry, pissed off, and discovering their powers. Their previous album, <i>Gold Against the Soul</i>, was a labored, sophomore-slumping hard rock turd that had them looking washed up early, and there was really no preparation for the intensity, perversion, and genuine darkness of <i>The Holy Bible</i>.</p><p>
    
    In a way, the story of Edwards' spiral into some unknown oblivion is tied to the experience of <i>The Holy Bible</i>, which in retrospect has become a sort of horror-show eulogy for a man who couldn't live with the world around him. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Tom Lord-Alge prepared a slightly different U.S. mix of the album that never saw release, and when years later mentions of the album in conjunction with other things I liked popped up in a couple of magazines, I decided I would procure it any way possible (like I said, it pushed me over the line), unaware of the context of its creation.</p><p>
    
    Flash to 2004 and to celebrate the album's 10-year anniversary, Epic has given it the royal, double-disc/single-DVD reissue treatment, remastering the UK mix and adding live tracks (different live tracks from the ones on the Japanese version, if you're wondering) and finally shedding daylight on the abandoned U.S. mix (the band's favorite mix, actually), which is included on disc two along with a couple of unremarkable demos and three radio session recordings.</p><p>
    
    It's best to approach the record from two angles: the political and the personal. Bassist Nicky Wire's lyrics cover the band's socialist propagandizing and soapbox grandstanding bases but it's Richey's songs of intimate torment that elevate the album beyond unbearable self-righteousness. The band's far-left politics range from platitudinous (""Prejudice burns so much brighter when it's all we have to burn"") to boneheaded (""Fuck the Brady Bill""? Come live in an American city for a few months, guys.), but anorexia diary ""4st 7lb"" brims with genuine anguish drawn from Richey's own personal struggle with the disease. ""I want to walk in the snow and not leave a footprint"" sings James Dean Bradfield on his behalf, pulling you into the head of someone who knows he has a problem, and not only can't he fix it, he grows to lord it over others, twisting it into a sort of superiority complex. It's harrowing stuff.</p><p>
    
    The remastering on the UK version does its job well, adding some extra punch, bulking up the low end, and rightfully clearing up Bradfield's superlative vocals a bit, but it's easy to see why the band was so taken with the U.S. mix. Aside from the occasional over-addition of reverb (""4st 7lb"" especially) and a bit at the end of ""Yes"" where the guitar just doesn't sound right at all, it really beefs up the rhythm section and injects a little needed space into the band's tightly coiled arrangements. And Sean Moore, the unsung Manic, finally gets his due on ""Ifwhiteamericatoldthetruthforonedayitsworldwouldfallapart"" when Lord-Alge rams his frenetic, excellent drumming straight up your nose. Wiry, explosive rockers like ""Faster"" and ""Mausoleum"" naturally benefit from the new emphasis on the band's inventive riffs and rhythms.</p><p>
    
    Back when I found this album at the record convention stall, I figured it would be lost to American ears for good, and quite frankly, Epic's decision to finally put it out over here in this deluxe edition is an odd one. Though it's had plenty of time to marinate in critical acclaim, the Manics are no more popular here now than they ever were-- perhaps less so than five or six years ago, actually-- and most Americans who were interested got their hands on imports long ago, rendering this purchase unnecessary to all but a select few. Still, a late arrival is better than none at all, and this reissue proves that the band's undeniable apex (only <i>Everything Must Go</i> even comes close) still retains the visceral power that made it so great to begin with.</p></div>"|5074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5074-the-holy-bible/|8.4|Joe Tangari

However, you don't have to listen long to the crazed psych-pop created by the Italian duo of Marco Fasolo and Alessio Gastaldello to realize that these fellows possess a ridiculous abundance of just such confidence. <i>Valende</i> is Jennifer Gentle's domestic debut, following two self-released albums back home, and it reveals a manic, uncommon glint in their inventive fires, the unmistakable fervid gleam which accompanies artists who know exactly what they're doing, even if the rest of us don't.</p><p> 
    
    Syd Barrett fans should recognize the name Jennifer Gentle from a lyric in Pink Floyd's ""Lucifer Sam"", and if you think that's the end of the duo's Barrett allusions I'm afraid you're a woefully bad guesser. Thankfully, though, <i>Valende</i> proves <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i>-era Floyd to be just one influence among many, and the rapturous melting pot of their sound also incorporates Joe Meek-inspired sci-fi daffiness, the adventurous instrumental textures of Nino Rota's film music, as well as tender-hearted loner-folk. And it's all combined with enough sheer homespun oddity that Jennifer Gentle's unique sound has even managed to awe the enlightened likes of the Sun City Girls and Acid Mothers Temple (whose Kawabata Makato has toured and cut a live radio session with the duo.)</p><p> 
    
    The album opens with the relatively restrained ditty ""Universal Daughter"", a brief number with a melodic structure similar to that of Barrett's ""Terrapin"", sung by Marco in a heightened toothache pitch that suggests he may have just sucked all the helium out of the Goodyear blimp. Though actually more subtle and reined-in than much of the material from earlier Jennifer Gentle albums like 2002's <i>Funny Creatures Lane</i>, the initial rush of this track hits like a quick puff of laughing gas, and immediately sets the album's alien tone. Speaking of helium, the boys issue still more on the following ""I Do Dream You"", releasing it slowly from a toy balloon (every toddler's favorite instrument) as a solo in the middle of the frantic number, which otherwise sounds like a prime 13th Floor Elevator single played at 78 rpm, complete with hairpin organ licks.</p><p> 
    
    After this breathless introduction clears away that first wave of big-game jitters, Jennifer Gentle settle down enough to allow <i>Valende</i> out for some fresh air, using acoustic guitar, glockenspiel, and a phased-out violin to conjure sadly sweet pastoral visions on ""Circle of Sorrow"", Field recordings of chirping birdies are brought in on the lovely folk sprawl of ""The Garden"", which is split into two sections. Although on acoustic guitar Marco lacks the technical prowess of a Ben Chasny or Matt (MV) Valentine, his enthusiasm and melodic economy help make these genteel excursions memorable. Less successful is the extended free-form track ""Hessesopoa"", a cacophonous improvisation that oddly enough feels like the most retro cut on the album, recalling the instrumental freak-outs of the Red Crayola's <i>Parable of Arable Land</i> in a manner that bears little new fruit. Clocking in at more than seven minutes, ""Hessesopoa"" does little to reward repeat listens, and its appearance mid-album unfortunately slows <i>Valende</i>'s momentum considerably.</p><p> 
    
    The two quickly recover from that misstep, however, and the album closes with the insane cartoonish glee of ""Nothing Makes Sense"", where the boys' sped-up voices eventually reach true Alvin and the Chipmunks velocity. And although it's the type of conclusion that might just prompt your annoyed spouse to come into the room to ask, ""what the hell IS that?"" something tells me that the men of Jennifer Gentle would proudly consider such a response to be a resounding success.</p></div>"|4354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4354-valende/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

There could be a grain of truth there, as understood from listening to hours of Bardo Pond in one sitting. The Philadelphians cannot kick their habit of playing blues that floats among the streets after the Earth sunk underneath the sea. The Brothers Gibbons don't strum their guitars as much as shaking off distortion to let their notes dry; Ed Farnsworth's trapkit desperately flails a waterfall and gasps for air; Clint Takeda's two-chord basslines ground the chaos on earth in a codeine slumber; and Isobel Sollenberger gives CPR breaths with her prayers in tongue.</p><p>
<i>Cypher Documents I</i> amasses six MP3s that Bardo Pond released monthly on its Hummingbird Mountain website for free between 1999 and 2000. Neophytes now have the opportunity to pay $13.95 for the goods. These tracks are mainly jams that gaze at their fingernails, but what the music beholds can barely be described by the King's English. There are almost no peaks or resolutions save for when the thinly-oiled machines collapse from entropy. In a way, <i>Cypher</i> marks a transition between <i>Set and Setting</i> and <i>Dilate</i>, although the band stills recycles its cauldron-boiled thrash-blues formula. Little progression here, but that doesn't matter.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Living Testament"" (released on the 2002 comp, <i>Get Your Pots Out</i>) is vintage Bardo Pond. Takeda and the Gibbons cough up soot while delivering their ohms to the heavens as Sollenberger murmurs and agonizes over migraines. One curious tune is ""Slag""-- a near-marvel of fumigation-rock. The guitars mechanically blow steam, grind out a downer blues, blow steam, grind, and so on. It is a great idea for a hit-and-run minute, but grows rather cumbersome over four. The best from the mire is ""Black Turban"", featuring a guitar solo that stumbles around in circles to see God's thousand faces, while another guitar shimmers a drone that tell the onlookers to not worry as the good Lord is working in mysterious ways. One of the Gibbons then spends the final three minutes tapping his strings as if trying to slap the divine one awake.</p><p>
<i>Cypher</i>'s finest moments are when the band simply breathes. ""Nomad"" is a pleasant stroll across a moonless plain with specks of yellow phospherent lights on the horizon. Sollenberger's violin veers by like a distant train, while Takeda's low bass tones are akin to covering your ears to hear your bloodstream. ""Quiet Tristin"" is just as haunting where the guitars are left to dangle on a lone tree surrounded by draught-cracked pools. The finale, ""From the Sky"" is a 31-minute psych-blues sketch projected on a two-story wall that can be a public safety hazard when played on a freeway drive. The auto-pilot groove floats in midair, while the guitars bite the surface, draw blood and skitter away-- all capable of knocking you into a daze. It's a peculiar sound.</p></div>"|562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/562-cypher-documents-i/|7.8|Cameron Macdonald

Funny then, how a litany of bathetic British bands-- Travis, Coldplay, Keane, Snow Patrol-- are all teary-eyed bluster and grandiloquent piano ballads that claw at the cloud cover till it's cheesecloth. Is England so gray and soggy that she needs these maudlin, unabashedly contrived arena-packers for a morale boost? I suppose if it's cloudy out, you lack a lady, the dog's got intestinal parasites, and you're wondering how it got to be time for <i>EastEnders</i> and you're still in sweats, the music has a certain charm. But most of us in the States want to spend an introspective hour with <i>Parachutes</i>. Nine times out of 10, we go for the quick fix.</p><p>
    
    Embrace have been at it for awhile and, like Bacardi and cola, you can always count on them to get the job done. But never have they turned in an effort as pretty or economical as <i>Out of Nothing</i>. Like a concert hall built atop a subway line, the album quakes with a faint but omnipresent tremor of sadness, tempering Embrace's heavenward stomp with a melancholic gegenschein.</p><p>
    
    The album opens on high with a song appropriately titled ""Ashes"". God knows what Embrace have endured: platinum-selling albums and chart-killing singles can take a toll. ""Ashes"", however, captures the feel of post-personal disaster perspective-shift, tidily kneading lyrics like: ""Now watch me rise up and leave all the ashes you made out of me,"" into a dutifully anthemic chorus. ""Gravity"", the album's lead UK single, is the standout ballad, a kindly, ""Imagine""-style piano pulser that manages to outstrip the sum of its parts.""Someday"" is the winsome, face-the-day rocker, replete with a chorus that wrenches as much as it punches and a tumid gospel-tinged ebb.</p><p>
    
    Only on ""Wish 'Em All Away"" and ""A Glorious Day"" do the band approach Oasis' pomp, and that's not even as bad as it sounds. On the former-- a lighters-out strum-- a chorus gravitating around the word ""wish"" and some superfluous harmonica is all. ""A Glorious Day"", meanwhile, is an unneeded rehash of ""Gravity"", the better ballad. Other bad news? Don't expect any choruses the size of Travis' ""Sing"" or any of Coldplay's chart-topping singles; Embrace prefer understatement and consistency. But the result is less wish-wash, more dependable songwriting. For our non-X-dropping sort of sad sack, <i>Out of Nothing</i> provides a neat and reliable uplift, and sometimes that means the world.</p></div>"|2769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2769-out-of-nothing/|7.3|Sam Ubl

The fruitful Vancouver singer/songwriter has, over the past few years, spread his yield among no less than three bands-- Pink Mountaintops, Black Mountain, and Jerk With a Bomb-- each exploring slight but intriguing variations on reference-happy rock'n'roll. His latest undertaking is Black Mountain, whose self-titled debut full-length is a rollicking, wildly adventurous reconfiguring of 1960s and 70s nostalgia that's as duty-bound to the present as it is sympathetic to the past.</p><p>
<i>Black Mountain</i> hits somewhere between Jerk With a Bomb's stellar but more straightforward <i>Pyrokinesis</i> and Pink Mountaintops' smarmy, sex-laden brand of vespertine blues-- only jacked up a good 20 decibels. McBean's voice is pleasant and instantly recognizable; having such an established songwriter behind a freshman outing is a tremendous advantage, and Black Mountain seem to know it. When the band aren't venturing on plush, static jams, his coy bluesy vocals tether the songs in familiar melodic space.</p><p>
    
    Svelte and upbeat, opener ""Modern Music"" stands apart from the rest of the album. Over jellybone saxophone and scattershot drumming, McBean and sidekick Amber Webber take jabs at ""another pop explosion"" and claim they ""can't stand all your modern music."" It's a trite argument, but nevertheless one for which Black Mountain makes a compelling case. Ironically, ""Modern Music"" is the album's least anachronistic and, almost as if to spite itself, catchiest number. ""Druganaut"" fits better into the retro regalia the band revere, weaving a loose-limbed vamp that, besides a few simple chord changes, seldom varies but is gradually added to. The vocals don't drop until nearly two minutes in, but the gap is barely noticeable. After the vocals arrive, it's into a series of haymaker guitar stabs and beefy drum fills, followed by a beautiful guitar feature-- spotted with ran-backward licks-- that exemplifies Black Mountain's penchant for texture and sameness within traditionally peripatetic verse-chorus-verse structures.</p><p>
    
    When Black Mountain evoke glue-sniffing shredders of yesteryear such Blue Cheer and Led Zeppelin, their technique falls nearer to Galaxie 500 and the Velvet Underground, who forsook showmanship and dug deep in search of music's fundamental soul. ""No Satisfaction""-- with its chunky strumming, honky-tonk piano, radiant plucked guitar and cheap-o sax-- most directly channels those aloof, technically slovenly forebears and, not surprisingly, is this album's best song. But there's nothing overtly sloppy about <i>Black Mountain</i>: Although it often wades in droning, repetitive passages, the album is impressively tight.</p><p>
    
    Some may hear these shopworn melodies and clamor ""bar band."" But if Black Mountain ever tried to make a night-to-night living in blues cover haunts, they'd do it by torching the stage and leaving patrons agog in WTF stares. The Vancouver quintet aren't some cabal of slack beer-bellied crooners; they can play their instruments, they have multi-chord vocabularies and, perhaps most importantly, they know how to give their songs proper recorded treatment. <i>Black Mountain</i> has that golden must-be-analog sound, with the perfect amount of tarnish to make the songs feel lived-in without burying them in fry grease.</p><p>
    
    Interestingly, Black Mountain are least effective at their most unpredictable. ""Heart of Snow"" resists structure, feeling out a plaintive acoustic strum before meeting up with a frail guitar and piano line, which meanders to a tense climax before erupting into a simplistic but captivating odd-time stomp. Unfortunately, the tension is drawn out as the band acquiesces back into a lugubrious Webber vocal passage, quashing the swelling momentum and rendering the eventual resolution less cathartic. ""Don't Run Our Hearts Around"" is the antithesis: the track is mercurial but calculated; its stilted operatic grandeur is a welcome bit of certainty. Orbiting the album's most generic and derivative riff, ""Don't Run Our Hearts Around"" starts with a clarion call-- a booming full-band hit or five-- then settles into a lurching unison guitar figure. The song seesaws for a bit, then has a mood swing and dives into a forlorn interlude, before picking up right where it left off and riding its central riff raw.</p><p>
    
    Black Mountain are about as referential as they come. But despite the obvious touchstones-- which, incidentally, fucking rule-- the band are affable and idiosyncratic enough to win over those who passed on recent retrofits like Comets on Fire's <i>Blue Cathedral</i> or My Morning Jacket's <i>It Still Moves</i>, and make those records' admirers practically cream themselves. Stephen McBean may be playing it safe by partitioning his rep, but the consistency and breadth of his work is staggering amid so many once-and-dones.</p></div>"|1146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1146-black-mountain/|8.3|Sam Ubl

New Year's Eve 2004: I skittered down to Elk Grove, Calif., on Highway 99 with rain boiling my windshield; obscuring my view save for suburban neons, crimson taillights, and scant highlights of freeway signs only legible from 10 feet away. I was concentrating not on the road but on an office door that I forgot to lock before I left for the weekend; my mind was so focused that I felt I was standing by that door waiting for myself to show up.</p><p>
    
    During that drive, Build an Ark's mantra of ""You gotta have peace and love"" seemed poetic and meaningful-- not that it was ever shallow before.</p><p>
    
    The Ark recorded their antiwar opus, <i>Peace with Every Step</i>, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The L.A. collective boasts 20 Latin-folk and Afro-groove musicians and singers, all rotating duties on songs that range from duets to drum-circles to all-hands-on-deck jams. Among the ranks are 1970s Black Liberation-jazz vets like percussionist Derf Reklaw (the Pharaohs), ex-Motown trombonist Phil Ranelin (Tribe), and vocalist Dwight Trible (Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra). Together, Build an Ark emulate the pantheistic awe of Sun Ra and John Coltrane. Leftfield hip-hop producer Carlos Nino (Ammoncontact) helms the street fair that only ends when the National Guardsman come.</p><p>
    
    The music mainly dwells on the psych-groove tip: Rhodes chords bathe the skies in indigos and golds, brass sections introduce the gospel in veteran's hospitals, and congas and trapkits keep the dance-circle going through dawn and dusk. Hell, they made my New Year's predicament of facing certain death seem like a swinging time.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""You've Gotta Have Freedom"" would make any agrophobe shake hands with everyone who enters a subway station. The tune grooves in a steady bebop cadence with Nate Morgan's Rhodes telling everyone that better days are ahead, ecstatic chants of ""You gotta have peace and love,"" and Joshua Spiegelman's bass clarinet stands in a corner, sees the Light, and then speaks in tongues. ""Vibes From the Tribe"" paints a Latin-groove in pure Technicolor with Ranelin and Spiegelman quipping ""you outta know something"" phrases on trombone and flute. ""Conversations"" and ""Precious, Priceless"" perform a fine, wartime blues as Morgan shimmers his Rhodes like two-second news-clips of butcher's bills in Iraq. ""Don't you feel our wailing?/ Can't you see our cries?/ Our glass is empty/ Oh, please be wise,"" Trible croons to the self-proclaimed guardians of the Free World.</p><p>
    
    ""Love Is Our Nationality"" could be the Ark's most polarizing trac: Peter Harris delivers a pacifist proclamation, ordering soldiers to ""strip off your uniform/ Salute your equal...put down your gun and pick up your baby."" He then declares, ""We are sweet-talking freedom fighters/ We are literary to curious children."" Many people could dismiss Harris and the rest of the Ark as hippies who'd answer an enemy attack by blowing bubbles at them. But there is strength in his voice that cannot be denied-- it's a conviction that can cause warrior societies to fear for their children as their parents view peacetime as dead-time. Baba Alade then picks up a guitar to give a soulful rendition of Willy Wonka's ""Pure Imagination""-- where utopia now goes beyond all edible materialism. It's a great power.</p></div>"|1148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1148-peace-with-every-step/|8.7|Cameron Macdonald

Though he suffers from the sort of debilitating tendonitis and carpel tunnel inflammations that would send most of us permanently to the sofa, Weeks has persevered to complete the most productive and satisfying stretch of his career to date. Following up his 2003 solo EP <i>Slightly West</i> and last year's extraordinary debut with his acid-folk group Espers, <i>Blood Is Trouble</i> finds Weeks using his voice and those damaged hands to create a quietly powerful suite of songs which resolutely delve the darkest shadows of his talents.</p><p>
    
    Although his extensive use of acoustic instrumentation will probably cause <i>Blood Is Trouble</i> to get lumped into the ongoing outsider folk movement, Weeks' songcraft here owes relatively little to folk tradition-- especially in comparison to his work in Espers. You'll certainly find nothing to resemble the ballads, jigs, and reels of Fairport Convention or the Incredible String Band. <i>Blood Is Trouble</i> instead belongs alongside the rain-soaked progressive art-rock of Nico, Leonard Cohen, and the more downcast recordings from the Canterbury scene, particularly albums like Robert Wyatt's <i>Rock Bottom</i>.</p><p>
    
    As with Weeks' previous solo efforts, the arrangements on <i>Blood Is Trouble</i> are heavy on harmonium and the hums of ancient keyboards. The weight of these earthy, ever-present drones-- frequently augmented here by the dramatic sweep of Margie Weink's cello and contra bass-- supply these songs with a seemingly bottomless gravity, which can often pull Weeks' vocals and guitar under their black waves. Melodically bolder than his past solo work, the album is punctuated with the occasional prog-rock indulgence, such as on the Ghost-like cymbal-crashing interjection of ""Don't You Open Up (Your Eyes)"" or the lush, near-chamber instrumental passages of ""Nearer Thine Eyes"".</p><p>
    
    As the album's title implies (unsurprisingly, given Weeks' health maladies), the lyrics are often centered around the difficulties caused by our possession of physical bodies. Whispers of danger and injury-- both actual and spiritual-- arise repeatedly in these songs, as on the foreboding ""Violence Lake"" where Weeks warns someone to ""Hide your body away from mine/ Because I know what I want to do to it."" And on ""These Hands"", Weeks appears to be directly formulating a stubborn answer to his own health problems, repeatedly singing ""These are not my hands before me"" until he sounds able to believe it enough to allow his guitar to weave nimble threads through the thick gauze of cello and keys.</p><p>
    
    Vocally, Weeks still has his limitations, and during some of the more emotive bits one can't help but wish he had his female Espers co-vocalists by his side. He does periodically receive splendid harmonic support, and not coincidentally it's those songs (""Wet Set"", ""Skelp Level Rd."") on which the hooks sink in immediately. But if you allow it time, the rest of <i>Blood Is Trouble</i> will eventually infuse your more melancholic solitary hours as well.</p></div>"|8603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8603-blood-is-trouble/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

Back in 1995 he was on the second of Warp's <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> compilations and debuted with an EP on Skam in 1996, but he kept people waiting until 1998 for his debut album <i>Soup</i>. A trickle of singles, collaborations, and compilation tracks kept people interested but unfulfilled, during which time Bola's stature continued to grow.</p><p>
    
    Both <i>Soup</i> and its follow-up, <i>Fyuti</i>, are good albums, but sometimes it seems as though Fitton's work nestles too easily into the classic Warp/Rephlex/Skam template. While you can't fault the construction of his tracks, one wishes his voice were just a bit more distinctive, that he had an easily identifiable signature to make him stand out in this crowded field. <i>Gnayse</i> doesn't quite remedy this situation, but it does present a departure, as Fitton moves Bola toward the fog-shrouded hills of pastoral electronica. It's strange how this sort of thing works, really, that purely electronic sound born and developed inside rubber-lined metal wires can evoke the leafy English countryside. But this chill seems far removed from the city center, conjuring instead with its long, patient melody lines a druggy stroll through a tangled garden.</p><p>
    
    The change in sound comes mostly from abandoning Bola's tightly sequenced synths-- a nod to classic techno-- and replacing them with slowly unwinding single notes that hang in the air and dissipate slowly like smoke. The short and lovely ""Heirairerr"" is like a Harold Budd composition heavy on the Eno treatments, with echoing notes that seem too fragile to sit next to the whining drone that snakes through. Equally evocative is ""Sirasancerre"", which fades in slowly from silence, beginning with a faint murmur of what could be insects at Lizard Point, then introduces melodramatic synthetic strings and, eventually, a coughing beat.</p><p>
    
    Though the opening of ""Papnwea"" suggests groaning machinery being pushed randomly by heavy wind, Fitton works his magic with synthetic sources, never peppering tracks with samples. This gives <i>Gnayse</i> a certain purity that helps it maintain its very specific mood. ""Papnwea"" illustrates another point when overbearing percussion bursts in just past the two-minute mark. As happens occasionally with Boards of Canada, you sometimes wonder how Bola might sound if Fitton moved in an even more ambient direction. It's the beats, definitely, that keep Bola staked near prototypical IDM, what is by now an overly familiar sound. He does this style well-- better than most, probably-- but the pleasures to be had inside these narrow confines are not infinite.</p></div>"|1072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1072-gnayse/|7.5|Mark Richardson

That's the first lesson curious hands learn at the piano. Your fingers can wander where they please on the ebony and the pentatonic scales will agree it's the place to go. And forget about tonal gravity, because the notes won't lead you to any resolution-- you can play these weightless notes for hours. Listening to hours of it, though, is another story and it gets old fast, which I guess is why the Climax Golden Twins cut off their own stick-to-the-black-keys moment barely two minutes into their latest album. ""Upright"" is the prettily pentatonic track in question, and though it's the most basic kind of amateur, pedal-down piano noodling, it's still strangely poignant. Set against slowly arcing scrapey-droney bits (stickheads rubbing on cymbals and the like), it takes on a great deal more power, and the minimal texture-songs that surround it deny it a chance to linger for too long.</p><p>
<i>Highly Bred and Sweetly Tempered</i>, the band's fifth album, is baked from simple, sparingly implemented ingredients sometimes spiked with challenging timbres and, on occasion, indebted to the ramshackle sound of ancient acoustic blues. That scraped, crackly, hazy feel is appropriate for a band whose website sells cassettes recorded from dusty 78s on their hand-cranked 1924 Victrola and also made a name for themselves in sound installations and soundtracks. Those same 78s-- field recordings, audio letters to loved ones and heirs, dramatic readings and the like-- pop up on several of these songs, speaking out of the ether like wandering souls.</p><p>
    
    The Climax Golden Twins practice a great deal of secrecy when it comes to their identities, but this stance has a logic related to their music, as its active ambient soundscapes surrender any focus on the musicians' personalities in favor of mood and nuanced sound. Guitars don't so much enter as happen, while the drumming is all loose brushwork, breathing cymbal and understated grace. ""I Had a Cousin, very old, he believed every word in the Bible. Well, I never did,"" says the lady on the 78 as ""Billy McGee McGaw"" slides in gracefully from the side, stuffed full of airy oscillations, papery snare, and guitar. ""For Adeline (Guitar Trio)"" is the late highlight, opening with the nearly impenetrable hiss and scratch that coats a once-fresh recording of a man singing over wispy, dead piano but pupating into a stark, organic guitar conversation that counts the fret noise as much a part of the music as the notes themselves.</p><p>
    
    If there's a misstep here, it's ""Solid Gold Microphone"", which sticks out of the middle of the record like a sore thumb, both as the only vocal track and as the only thing that's terrible-- the minimal guitar and phlegmy, tentative vocals belonged on the cutting room floor instead of the middle of the record. But most of the album succeeds in spinning a web of flaxen beauty that swallows your thoughts in its texture and caresses even in its harshest moments. It's not a revelation, but it is a very pleasing album.</p></div>"|1790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1790-highly-bred-and-sweetly-tempered/|7.2|Joe Tangari

S. Congress voted to
    revise and re-imagine the Telecommunications Act of 1934: in 1996-- in
    a supposed show of support for capitalism and free competition--
    Congress (operating under then-President Bill Clinton) effectively
    eliminated rules restricting the sizes of the companies owning and
    operating media outlets. Consequently, a freshly deregulated American
    radio somersaulted through a period of massive and unchecked
    consolidation, quickly and severely limiting options for helpless
    consumers. Check it: In the past 10 years, corporate leviathan Clear
    Channel has gone from owning and operating 25 radio stations
    to commanding a stifling 1,200-- unsurprisingly, all
    this skybox-intervention has resulted in one-page playlists,
    unilateral censorship, and the disintegration of the
    DJ-as-unique-personality (see, instead, piles of middle-aged men with
    stupid names hollering obnoxious nonsense into giant microphones).
    Now, we drag duffel bags of CDs into our cars, buy adapters for our
    iPods, and think about radio stations the same way we think about
    Viacom: with disgust.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, deregulation-in-favor-of-competition is hardly a
    phenomenon that's unique to radio (nor is it inherently destructive);
    likewise, the dourness of contemporary radio is not entirely Clear
    Channel's fault. Ultimately, Clear Channel was simply the first
    corporate entity to pounce on an ample opportunity to make more cash
    by buying up every satellite in sight, acting on perfectly common--
    if vaguely depressing-- capitalist itches.</p><p>
    Given all this, the continuing prominence of the Santa Monica-based
    public broadcasting station KCRW, a community service of Santa Monica
    College, seems even more imperative. Long considered one of the
    nation's most universally-acclaimed public radio stations-- offering
    slices of NPR and PRI's programming as well as plenty of locally-grown
    news and music shows-- KCRW is to the West Coast what WFMU is to the
    East: a reliable, intensely non-commercial forum for new
    and emerging talent, determined wholly independently of major label
    marketing dollars. The results are impressive: KCRW music director
    Nic Harcourt, host of the station's celebrated weekday morning spot,
    ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"", can take at least partial responsibility for
    the stateside ""breaking"" of previously un-backed artists like Sigur
    Rós, Coldplay, Norah Jones, Dido, and David Gray.
    (Harcourt credits at least some of his influence to the impossibly
    car-bound Los Angeles record execs that comprise much of his
    audience.)</p><p>
    Each week, 15 hours of ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"" is condensed into
    a two-hour best-of, pithily dubbed ""Sounds Eclectic"". This nationally
    syndicated wrap-up, also hosted by Harcourt, features the week's best
    live performance and interview, as well as a mix of the show's
    trademark ""eclectic"" tracks. ""Sounds Eclectic""'s latest promotional
    compilation, <em>Sounds Eclectic 3</em>"" (which is available for purchase on
    KCRW's website-- all proceeds directly support the station's music
    programming), collects the show's best live tracks from 2002 and 2003,
    and features an impressive lineup, including Interpol's ""Untitled"",
    Iron &amp; Wine's cover of the Flaming Lips' ""Waiting for A Superman"",
    Steve Earle's ""Jerusalem"", Franz Ferdinand's ""Take Me Out"",
    Radiohead's ""Go to Sleep"", and My Morning Jacket's ""One Big Holiday"",
    among others.</p><p>
    All of the performances were recorded directly to two-track digital
    audio tape, and none have been re-recorded, remixed, or overdubbed,
    thus preserving all the awkward intimacy of performing rock songs in a
    radio studio at 10:30 a.m. To this end, the Flaming Lips offer a
    dawdling, piano-led version of ""Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Pt.
    1"", in which vocalist Wayne Coyne, mewing careful and soft, manages to
    sound approximately 11 years old. Given the undeniable intimacy of
    KCRW's format (and Coyne's child-nightmare lyrics), that
    pre-adolescent whining becomes oddly, staggeringly appropriate, and
    ""Yoshimi"" is instantly transcendent-- as chilling as it is charming.</p><p>
    My Morning Jacket's live version of ""One Big Holiday"" is equally
    impressive, their guitar bonanza even more spectacular when captured
    live, and so palpably ecstatic that you can almost see the hair lassos
    swinging. The Polyphonic Spree's ""It's the Sun"" booms in full,
    multi-voiced, psychedelic glory. Welsh songstress Jem coos the dulcet
    ""Flying High"" over tender acoustic strums (Jem's subsequent record
    deal with ATO is generally considered a direct result of Harcourt's
    airplay), murmuring plaintively, each breath captured with impeccable
    fidelity, making it sound like Jem is curled up in your armchair.</p><p>
    The tragic flaw of <em>Sounds Eclectic 3</em> is that the eclecticism so
    staunchly implied in the title never actually reveals itself on the
    compilation: The artists included are (by now) relatively
    well-known acts, and the comp's curators failed to slip in
    any of the weird, demo-only discoveries that contributed to ""Morning
    Becomes Eclectic""'s renown. The bands included are mostly white,
    from either North America or the UK (save Mexico's Kinky, whose
    fantastic ""Mirando De Lado"" is an immediate standout), and play quirky
    variations of radio-friendly pop, folk, and rock. No matter how
    compelling some of the performances may be, there's not much here to
    make you sprint off to the record store. (Remember: It has been two to
    three years since these songs were recorded, and the laws of
    trickle-down indienomics totally point to your dad being way into
    Franz Ferdinand right now.) Still, <em>Sounds Eclectic 3</em> features
    interesting, extremely well-recorded live cuts, and the price of the
    disc-- essentially just a small donation to support public
    broadcasting-- is more than worth it.</p><p>
    Last October, incomparable Radio 1 DJ John Peel (posthumously
    celebrated in Britain's <i>The Observer</i> by former Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker,
    who wondered: ""To have your own radio show and play just what you like!
    To communicate with the audience just as if you were talking to a friend.
    What a simple idea! How obvious! So how come no one else is doing it?"")
    died in Peru, reminding everyone what radio could (and should) be, and,
    sadly, how bad it has become. <em>Sounds Eclectic 3</em> may seem a little
    predictable in 2005, but Harcourt and KCRW are still undoubtedly precious
    commodities.</p></div>"|2060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2060-kcrw-sounds-eclectic-3/|8.0|Amanda Petrusich

I had that pleasant misfortune when I spent my junior prom night hanging outside a neighbor's Pontiac that blared Ministry's ""Everyday Is Halloween"". The song seemed about right for good times at home when your friends, acquaintances, and enemies are living fairy tales.</p>
<p>Ministry fused the American teenage wasteland with industrial music-- taking the noise out of the galleries, basements, and bridge underpasses and onto the sun-melted, third-generation tapes on so many metalheads' dashboards. Yet, their 1984 goth-disco hit, ""Everyday"" is decadence of a difference sort. The music plods along like a 45 of Bananarama's ""Venus"" spun by a worn turntable belt, while our man Al Jourgensen yowls, ""Well I live with snakes and lizards/ And other things that go bump in the night/ Cos to me everyday is Halloween,"" in a faux Aussie accent like an undead Peter Garrett. Good times, good times.</p>
<p>Last year saw a Ministry renaissance. After hang-ups with Bugs Bunny Records, co-mastermind Paul Barker's departure, and skag abuse, the Chicagoans finally regained their dues-- or at least revived 1992. Their 2004 album, <i>Houses of the Molé</i> returned to the glorious horrorshow of <i>Psalm 69</i>, namely the robotized street carnival riot of ""NWO"" (built on Bush Sr.'s declaration of a ""New World Order""). During the same year that saw Bush Jr. stay in power, up came reissues of Jourgensen's trailer-trash funk unit, Revolting Cocks, plus a director's cut of Ministry's landmark entry into Industrial with a capital ""I,"" <i>Twitched</i>. However, the most interesting releases to emerge are <i>Early Trax</i> and <i>Side Trax</i>-- episodes of Ministry's virginity and the venereal diseases it then spread to others.</p>
<p><i>Early</i> is like reading a second grade book report. Actually, the synth-pop that defined Ministry during the early 80s is decent. Hearing electroclash for the past few years somehow immunized me from both the Miami Sound Machine attack on the hexagon drums and Tron-age synths. <i>Early</i> is essentially <i>Twelve Inch Singles</i> repackaged with a few extra remixes and b-sides. The main additions are the fey, Costelloid impression in ""Overkill"" and the passable Sisters of Mercy raveup of ""I'm Falling"". However, the distant factory din can be heard on the previously unreleased oldie, ""He's Angry"", as the percussions echo like clockwork-- loosely akin to the fascist-funk of their later ""Land of Rape and Honey"".</p>
<p><i>Side</i> offers some of the best ideas that Ministry never used during their late-80s heyday, a time when thrash-metal made sense as mechanized blues for the Information Age. Chief among them went to Pailhead, Jorgensen's 1988 one-off with Ian MacKaye, and the curious 1000 Homo DJs, who released a Black Sabbath tribute EP where an uncredited Trent Reznor and Jello Biafra figured in.</p>
<p>Urban legends of Ian ""I've gotta Straight Edge"" MacKaye dropping LSD during the Pailhead sessions aside, the songs from their <i>Trait EP</i> offer a deft marriage of postpunk guitar harmonics and conveyor-belt rhythms. ""Don't Stand in Line"" could be industrial's own ""Eye of the Tiger"" (sans the camp), while ""I Will Refuse"" pits MacKaye against the din of a TV-- his lone voice of defiance fading in and out of the ether.</p>
<p>1000 Homo DJs' lone 1991 EP is best remembered for its gutbucket-metal cover of the Sabs' ""Supernaut"" where Mr. Reznor screams in his sleep. It's the happiest I've heard the boy, although Biafra does make a great actor in playing a good ole boy cop harassing a car full of metalheads in ""Hey Asshole"". However, Jorgensen gives a convincing barfly's after-school lecture in the leafblower groove of ""Better Ways"".</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Side</i> sounds like sci-fi soundtracks for the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones and the Van Dammes; where commentaries on the human condition and destiny are articulated by M-60 gunfire. PTP (Ministry with longtime collaborator Chris Connelly) delivers ESPN grooves that the Everquest and Quake burnouts might enjoy. Their standout is ""Show Me Your Spine"" from the <i>Robocop</i> soundtrack, which features the priceless orchestra-stab and Skinny Puppy Nivek Ogre's forked-tongue. Much stronger is Acid Horse (the crew versus industrial pioneers Cabaret Voltaire) and the Chicagoan electro-funk of their lone single, ""No Name, No Slogan"".</p>

I had that pleasant misfortune when I spent my junior prom night hanging outside a neighbor's Pontiac that blared Ministry's ""Everyday Is Halloween"". The song seemed about right for good times at home when your friends, acquaintances, and enemies are living fairy tales.</p>
<p>Ministry fused the American teenage wasteland with industrial music-- taking the noise out of the galleries, basements, and bridge underpasses and onto the sun-melted, third-generation tapes on so many metalheads' dashboards. Yet, their 1984 goth-disco hit, ""Everyday"" is decadence of a difference sort. The music plods along like a 45 of Bananarama's ""Venus"" spun by a worn turntable belt, while our man Al Jourgensen yowls, ""Well I live with snakes and lizards/ And other things that go bump in the night/ Cos to me everyday is Halloween,"" in a faux Aussie accent like an undead Peter Garrett. Good times, good times.</p>
<p>Last year saw a Ministry renaissance. After hang-ups with Bugs Bunny Records, co-mastermind Paul Barker's departure, and skag abuse, the Chicagoans finally regained their dues-- or at least revived 1992. Their 2004 album, <i>Houses of the Molé</i> returned to the glorious horrorshow of <i>Psalm 69</i>, namely the robotized street carnival riot of ""NWO"" (built on Bush Sr.'s declaration of a ""New World Order""). During the same year that saw Bush Jr. stay in power, up came reissues of Jourgensen's trailer-trash funk unit, Revolting Cocks, plus a director's cut of Ministry's landmark entry into Industrial with a capital ""I,"" <i>Twitched</i>. However, the most interesting releases to emerge are <i>Early Trax</i> and <i>Side Trax</i>-- episodes of Ministry's virginity and the venereal diseases it then spread to others.</p>
<p><i>Early</i> is like reading a second grade book report. Actually, the synth-pop that defined Ministry during the early 80s is decent. Hearing electroclash for the past few years somehow immunized me from both the Miami Sound Machine attack on the hexagon drums and Tron-age synths. <i>Early</i> is essentially <i>Twelve Inch Singles</i> repackaged with a few extra remixes and b-sides. The main additions are the fey, Costelloid impression in ""Overkill"" and the passable Sisters of Mercy raveup of ""I'm Falling"". However, the distant factory din can be heard on the previously unreleased oldie, ""He's Angry"", as the percussions echo like clockwork-- loosely akin to the fascist-funk of their later ""Land of Rape and Honey"".</p>
<p><i>Side</i> offers some of the best ideas that Ministry never used during their late-80s heyday, a time when thrash-metal made sense as mechanized blues for the Information Age. Chief among them went to Pailhead, Jorgensen's 1988 one-off with Ian MacKaye, and the curious 1000 Homo DJs, who released a Black Sabbath tribute EP where an uncredited Trent Reznor and Jello Biafra figured in.</p>
<p>Urban legends of Ian ""I've gotta Straight Edge"" MacKaye dropping LSD during the Pailhead sessions aside, the songs from their <i>Trait EP</i> offer a deft marriage of postpunk guitar harmonics and conveyor-belt rhythms. ""Don't Stand in Line"" could be industrial's own ""Eye of the Tiger"" (sans the camp), while ""I Will Refuse"" pits MacKaye against the din of a TV-- his lone voice of defiance fading in and out of the ether.</p>
<p>1000 Homo DJs' lone 1991 EP is best remembered for its gutbucket-metal cover of the Sabs' ""Supernaut"" where Mr. Reznor screams in his sleep. It's the happiest I've heard the boy, although Biafra does make a great actor in playing a good ole boy cop harassing a car full of metalheads in ""Hey Asshole"". However, Jorgensen gives a convincing barfly's after-school lecture in the leafblower groove of ""Better Ways"".</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Side</i> sounds like sci-fi soundtracks for the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones and the Van Dammes; where commentaries on the human condition and destiny are articulated by M-60 gunfire. PTP (Ministry with longtime collaborator Chris Connelly) delivers ESPN grooves that the Everquest and Quake burnouts might enjoy. Their standout is ""Show Me Your Spine"" from the <i>Robocop</i> soundtrack, which features the priceless orchestra-stab and Skinny Puppy Nivek Ogre's forked-tongue. Much stronger is Acid Horse (the crew versus industrial pioneers Cabaret Voltaire) and the Chicagoan electro-funk of their lone single, ""No Name, No Slogan"".</p>
<p>Some purists argue that Ministry ruined industrial music, converting the genre's multimedia terrorism and rawness into mere metal fodder. Perhaps we could have been saved from the mid-90s dreck of bands that major label sold to Hot Topic shoppers if Ministry still aped to be the next Thompson Twins. Nonetheless, <i>Side Trax</i> has a few fresh ideas still worth returning to.</p></div>"|11779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11779-early-trax-side-trax/|7.6|Cameron Macdonald

Unfortunately, the Shimmer Kids timed their arrival a couple of years too late to climb aboard the Elephant 6 and Terrastock gravy train, and though records like 2002's <i>The Natural Riot</i> showed great promise, by that point it seemed most listeners were too Olivia Tremor Controlled-out for the group to really enter their audience's collective forebrain.</p><p>
    
    In 2003, after the Shimmer Kids' accomplished <i>The Book of Mirrors</i> EP sank with barely a ripple, the group again assembled in the recording studio, but this time they found their new material to be such a drastic change from their previous work that the result was a reconfigured line-up with the new Society of Rockets name. Gone are the Shimmer Kids' grandiose paisley epics, stuffed to the rafters with dense layers of oddball instrumentation. Instead <i>Sunset Homes</i> reveals a much more sober, pared-back vision of the group as waylaid cosmic cowboys singing around the campfire in a Greyhound station parking lot.</p><p>
    
    An about-face this severe is obviously not made without some risk. Aside from the crystalline vocals of Joshua Babcock, there's virtually nothing here that even the most eagle-eared listener will recognize from the group's former incarnation. And by scaling their arrangements down so significantly, they've placed much more importance upon the quality of their playing and songwriting. Thankfully, however, the songs here are strong enough bear up under the harsh light of day, and on <i>Sunset Homes</i> the Society of Rockets sound as though they've finally staked claim to a sound they can truly make their own.</p><p>
    
    The opening ""O, Sing Transformer"" attempts to make the segue to the new land as comfortable as possible, as Babcock's voice and piano are carried skyward by a lysergic haze of squeezebox and organ. But that gentle reverie ends abruptly with the ramshackle On the Beach stomp of the following ""Untitled"", on which drummer Mike Evans provides the mule kick necessary to fully introduce the group's revamped sound.</p><p>
    
    In another break with the band's lo-fi history, <i>Sunset Homes</i> benefits from an extremely crisp analog production job by Mark Erickson. In the past, the band's predilection for exotic instrumentation would sometimes result in stray accordions or sleigh bells getting completely buried in an amorphous mash. Here instead, every element is rationed more judiciously, and in Erickson's pristine mix each musician's contribution is made that much more potent. The addition of Lorelei David's theremin to the Stones-y ""Too Many Thorns In Your Bed of Roses"" gives the song a satisfyingly precarious wobble, while the inclusion of ingredients like cello, melodica or various spacey sound effects help keep tracks like ""The Flood"" or the lovely ""Never No Fences"" from ever descending into rote alt-country traditionalism.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the biggest departure for the group is in their lyrics. Where Shimmer Kids' lyrics were a day-glo pastiche of imagery from comic books and the paranoid sci-fi of William Burroughs and Philip K. Dick, here their words are concerned with the resolutely earthbound themes of road weariness, hangovers, and broken friendships. Though at times this newfound realism finds the group nestling uncomfortably close to cliche (particularly on the skimpy album-closing piano pop of ""Let's Make a Scene"") it does force Babcock and company to find new, more honest ways to personalize their voice. In a manner reminiscent of such albums as Wilco's <i>Being There</i> or My Morning Jacket's <i>The Tennessee Fire</i>, <i>Sunset Homes</i> contains the sound of a band just beginning to tap into their full potential, as well as the realization that any attempt to map out this group's future possible destinations will likely prove futile.</p></div>"|7799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7799-sunset-homes/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

A power trio comprised of members of Bright Eyes' backing band, Desaparecidos, and the Good Life, the latest export from ""Omaha's burgeoning music scene"" (to cop a perplexingly behind-the-curve quote from the band's press bio) hews closest to the fizzy, furious pop-punk of Desaparecidos. Many sophisticated listeners have already clicked the ""Back"" arrow on their browser at the first mention of pop-punk, the Disneyland of musical genres, but those who remain might be in for a pleasant surprise.</p><p>
    
    While the '89 Cubs start with the predictable adrenaline boosts and anthemic dynamics of Desaparecidos, early Superchunk, Alkaline Trio, and the Get Up Kids, they leaven these shopworn chord changes with unusual yet intuitively sensible variations, lacing their songs with kinks, hiccups, spaz-outs, and atmospheric passages that constantly refresh their capacity to surprise and engage. I'd call it ""post-pop-punk,"" but I couldn't sleep nights if I were responsible for a new micro-genre in an already overly-specialized musical taxonomy; let's just call it aesthetically ambitious pop-punk with a strong predilection for shoegaze and sweeping, lyrical guitar passages.</p><p>
    
    The opening track, the mini-epic ""Candid Flames"" begins with a longish instrumental segment before Ryan Fox's husky, even-keeled vocals commence, deftly shifting between the gliding expressivities of My Bloody Valentine and slashing, chugging riffs which seem to say: You'll get amped and like it. The wavering, cyclic intro of ""Sorry Tornado"" rolls into a classic 4/4 lead, then into a dense and explosive verse that eventually loops back to the simple melodic figure at its core. ""We Won the Party"" counterpoises syncopated, scorching rock swathed in dissonant feedback against the sort of succinct melodic packets to be found on a Thermals record.</p><p>
    
    For fans of pop-punk, or emo-punk, or however you choose to perceive it, <em>There Are Giants in the Earth</em> could be the sleeper hit of the year (well, of last year-- thanks for bearing with us as we sweep the last dying embers from 2004's cooling hearth). Those of you who usually turn up your noses at such stuff (myself admittedly included) might find it to be a humbling, somewhat furtive pleasure-- with enough intellectual grist to justify playing it in public, but not enough to obscure the sheer exuberance at its core, the '89 Cubs temporarily rejuvenate those dormant mental channels that course with blissful, uncomplicated anima, the ones you felt certain you'd outgrown.</p></div>"|2918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2918-there-are-giants-in-the-earth/|7.3|Brian Howe

That particular someone knows all the words and all the vocals and can hit every chord on air guitar, but despite the exuberance and sincerity of the performance, it's never more than mimicry spiked with the narcissistic thrill of playing the rock star.</p><p>
    
    Similarly, <i>Amok</i> is more about imitation than innovation. The Late BP Helium is neither dead nor related in any way to British Petroleum; instead, it's a pseudonym for Bryan Poole, a veteran of Georgia-based bands Elf Power, Great Lakes, and Of Montreal. Poole's debut full-length, which follows the <i>Kumquat Mae</i> EP, is the work of an artist enamored with his own musical forebears-- 70s rock and pop giants like T. Rex and Cheap Trick, as well as Pavement and just about every Elephant 6 band you could name. Wearing his influences on his sleeve isn't necessarily a crime, but he holds too much reverence for his source material, so there's more of Marc Bolan and Bryan Ferry on <i>Amok</i> than of Poole himself.</p><p>
    
    Even if there isn't much here that you haven't already heard on <i>Electric Warrior</i>, <i>In Color</i>, or even <i>The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone</i>, Poole is having a blast on these 11 songs. ""Belief System Derailment Screnario"" trips along herky-jerky, driven by a saxophone groove that bridges the considerable gap between Roxy Music and X-Ray Spex. ""Candy for Everyone"" is a concentrated T. Rex groove complete with a kazoo solo and the album's weakest melody. ""The Emperor's Drone"", which serves as a mid-album intermission, borrows its meditative atmosphere from Can and Kraftwerk. And on ""Curse of the Trial"" Poole sounds almost exactly like <i>S&amp;E;</i>-era Stephen Malkmus as his makeshift backing band drums up a tight indie-pop hook.</p><p>
<i>Amok</i> is at its best when Poole steps out from behind the pseudonym and throws some surprises into the mix. If such occurrences are few and far between, they still redeem the album somewhat. ""The Ballad of Johnny Rad"" takes a break from its propulsive 70s pop charge to indulge a 50s-style guitar solo that morphs into Beach Boys harmonies before sliding right back into its signature hook, neatly summarizing three decades of pop music in only a few seconds. The album's best track, ""They Broke the Speed of Light"", ends with a lengthy coda that grows more exuberant and exciting as it threatens to live up to the song's title. This moment, more than any other, hints at the depths of Poole's pop savvy, if only he weren't so starstruck.</p></div>"|4977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4977-amok/|6.5|Stephen M. Deusner

It's no longer a matter of taste, other than the fact that I have good taste, whereas you, Fiery Furnaces-hater, do not. Don't have time to take in the full sweeping grandeur of <em>Blueberry Boat</em>'s 80 minutes? I have no respect for your calendar priorities. To those who find their multiple-movement symphonies and keyboard-fetish arrangements overcooked, I feel only loathing, utter disdain, and approximately one tablespoon of pity! And for the few of you that cannot handle the frenetic uber-medley that is a Fiery Furnaces live set, I want to make provocative documentary films about your inept and offensive taste and take them on the festival circuit.</p><p>
    But if my depraved fanboy rants and threats don't convince you, this here spartanly-titled EP just might. Dare you infidels bear witness as this collection of the Furnaces' assorted table scraps easily outshines most bands' main course? Not content to merely isolate the most accessible tune from their long players and ship a CD-R out to campus hundred-watts, Eleanor and Matthew Friedberger are prolific vinyl-pressers, releasing new or reinterpreted material betwixt and in conjunction with their albums. <em>EP</em> does the Soulseek virtual crate-digging for Furnaces devotees, collecting most of these odds and sods while wisely catching amnesia on their less-collectible Clash and Fall covers.</p><p>
    I know of some misguided souls who find that the accoutrements of <em>Blueberry Boat</em>'s three-ring concept album circus overwhelm any songcraft talents the siblings Friedberger originally exhibited on <em>Gallowsbird's Bark</em>, and for these people my hatred burns only slightly less bright. Nevertheless, <em>EP</em> starts off with a trilogy of tunes that should lay this ridiculous claim to rest, restoring their most recent single to its original director's cut. Running a little over 10 minutes, the suite simultaneously reminds the doubters of the Furnaces' considerable pop abilities, while not compromising on the Casio blitzes or thematic density of more recent work.
    </p><p>
    If ""Single Again"", in a slightly expanded take, remains a bit cold in with its jump-rope chant refrain and stiff drums, reinstated bridge ""Here Comes the Summer"", is the perfect thaw, showcasing the duo's deft hand with electronic rhythms, guitar pedals, and swooning melodies. ""Summer"" seasonally segues into ""Evergreen"", the band's sweetest ballad to date, and the first that comes close to making the Carpenters comparisons more than just commentary on the Friedberger's slightly creepy sibling dynamics.
    </p>
<p>
    There's enough to digest in that opening salvo to fulfill the effort's modest title, but there's still a half-hour smattering of B-sides and remakes for dessert. A few (""Duffer St. George"", ""Smelling Cigarettes"") swerve towards the ADD collage style of <em>Blueberry Boat</em>'s longer tracks, telling similarly intricate stories of infidelity, drinking, and gallivanting around London. Matthew's imaginary Cockney accent takes the lead more often than on the full-lengths, whether on the tongue-twisting sea shanty of ""Cousin Chris"" or the Bowie piano-rock of ""Sing for Me"".
    </p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, the complete reconstruction of ""Tropical Ice-land"" featured here is a taste of the band's Dylan-like compulsion to perennially revise the back catalog, expanding the sing-songy original in every direction, right down to a wonderfully gratuitous backwards-vocal verse. In the end, it's perhaps this quality of perpetual evolution, best exemplified by their delirious live shows, that has me drawing Fiery Furnaces logos on my All-Stars-- few other bands of the indie world seem to have such mercurial aspirations.
    </p>
<p>
<em>EP</em> then comes off like a quick appendix to the band's work so far, concentrating their strengths in parts while elsewhere lovingly dumping the stray ideas that may not fit into their next conceptual flight. That it still manages to skirt the hazards of being a for-fan's-only release only deepens my stalker-love, not to mention the accompanying abhorrence for all who don't see the light. Honestly, how do you people wake up in the morning; you pathetic, mouth-breathing [<em>the remaining 1,000 words of diatribe deleted by Pitchfork editors, who cordially apologize to the readership for Mr. Mitchum's unfortunate outburst -Ed.</em>]

Nobody asked him to do this obviously, and though the scene was gross, nobody protested either. Everybody just laughed-- the only option, really. ODB had so successfully blurred the line between playing the fool and actually being retarded, nobody would dare criticize him for fear of seeming pointlessly cruel or, worse, painfully out of the loop. ODB was better than a fool though: Not only did he say and do what others didn't, but where fools get away with their foolishness, ODB fell victim to his own heedlessness at every turn. He lived the life-- cash money, bitches, crack, fast cars, etc.-- but unlike others, ODB always suffered the consequences: poverty, child support, crippling addiction, prison, and traffic violations. ODB was simultaneously everything and nothing most MCs want to be.</p><p>
    
    A few seconds into ""Pop Shots""-- the lead track on the posthumous <i>Osirus: The Official Mixtape</i>-- ODB invokes his most foolish public display, that surprise interruption of Puffy's Grammy acceptance speech in 1998. ""Look here, more money, more problems, my ass/ You're a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real/ That's a trick to try to keep you where you at/ All content, while niggas ridin' Bentleys and Maybach"", the fool says. He's right to chide, wrong to look past the personal contradiction but in the end completely unassailable, if only because he's ODB.</p><p>
    
    At this point only our coolest friends can say, ""I'm Rick James, bitch!"" when they break their own rules. Really though, no one-- maybe not even Rick James himself-- deserves the line more than ODB. <i>Nigga Please</i> made the Superfreak/ODB kinship explicit, and the best tracks on <i>Osirus</i> pin Dirt's ululations and double-edged sex-crazed rants on cold-blooded, rubber-band funk. An early tit-for-tat with Rhymefest on ""Dirty Dirty"" makes the gluttonous ODB sound like a permanent morality play: ""What can make a ho look more cuter?/ Hennessy shots and smoke more buddha/ [I don't know, Dirt, now she look like Jab Zuda/ Test my manhood go get my dick ruler]/ Now you're hungry wanna eat right through her"". Similarly, none of us should ever command a girl, ""Come sit on Mini-Me and put a smile on Dr. Evil,"" as on slow jam ""P*ssy Keep Calling"", but we're happy ODB said it-- if only to remind us that we shouldn't. Says Rhymefest, ""What's rap without Dirt? What's the whole world without Dirt? Just a bunch of fucking water.""</p><p>
    
    Extend the dirt/water boast to the rapper/producer relationship on <i>Osirus</i>, and we get to the mixtape's biggest flaws-- most beats are shit, and guests flow muddily. This isn't <i>The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones Part II</i>, but RZA's production is again sorely missed. When tracks go retro-thug without a hitch (several of them do), ODB just sounds past-prime and pathetic: ""If y'all want war/ let's get it on/ Cause we don't care/ Where y'all from"" is a career nadir. ""Down South"" is, I guess, a Lil Jon crunk send-up, but the song's too listless to make a point of it.</p><p>
    
    However official this mixtape says it is, <i>Osirus</i> is still just a test run for Ol' Dirty Bastard's more official posthumous release on Roc-A-Fella later this year. Which is good news, of course. For every posthumous album, there's a Posthumous Album Game to be played, and hardcore ODB fans will surely pore over his last release hoping to uncover a death prophecy. Perfect fool that he is though, ODB has been hinting at his death since the beginning of his career. Every asinine rhyme he's dropped, every child support check he hasn't paid, every little girl he's saved from a moving vehicle's impact-- from all these, we can be sure ODB intimately understood his fate. Otherwise, wow, what a fucking retard that guy was.</p></div>"|6104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6104-osirus-the-official-mixtape/|6.4|Nick Sylvester

That thundering ""Boom! Ch-chik! Boom!"" that Phil Spector stopped time with on the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" back in 1963, that one that nobody seems to be able to trump 40 years later. It's in ""Just Like Honey"" and ""Everything Must Go"" and ""The Bear"" and ""You Are the Generation Who Bought More Shoes and You Get What You Deserve"" and it sounds just as good every damn time. If a band is stealing this intro, it's probably because it has realized it wasn't going to write a better one. Augie March's sophomore album <em>Strange Bird</em> opens with just this intro, cleverly transferred from the snare and toms to the guitar and hi-hat, but still booming with immediacy.</p><p>
    
    So now that they've got your attention, does this Aussie quintet have anything to say? Quite a lot, it turns out, with an 18-page lyric booklet to spell it out if you become lost in their heavy accents. Such charming accents, though, and more power to them for not trying to sound like they're from Southern California, even as much of their music dives deeply into Brian's sandbox and leans on Spector's Wall of Sound. <em>Strange Bird</em> is a Technicolor pop opus that's so stuffed with ideas and instruments that it's wont to rupture from time to time, as the band's ambition blows away the substance of the songs with organ overdubs and enough Zildjian crashing and bashing to overwhelm the treble.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, if there's a complaint to be made about <em>Strange Bird</em>, it's that there is a surplus of sound. At the end of ""Brundisium"", they sound like three Wrecking Crews, and it distracts a bit from the exquisite melody that the jam overtakes. Likewise, Glenn Richards' rich, soft lead vox on closer ""O Song"" are backed by a wailing accompaniment uttering the same lines low in the mix, a la Pink Floyd's ""Southampton Dock"", and it's slightly too much-- the harmonium and horns had the backing down just fine, thanks. But we're complaining too much here, I'm afraid. There's much more good stuff to talk about than bad.</p><p>
    
    Take opener ""The Vineyard"", for instance. After the Spector tribute, it becomes a languid, labyrinthine ballad stuffed with ghostly harmonies, lovely descending piano parts, wandering backwoods guitar leads and a generally warm, Fridmann/Lips glow that invites you into the band's florid poesy and symphonic arrangement sense. But it's a setup, because while you're adimiring their slow beauty, they blindside you on track two: ""This Train Will Be Taking No Passengers"" is a wailing rockabilly psych raver that chug-a-chugs through verses like ""Onward and on to the ends of love/ Pricked vanity, habit and ruse/ Onward and on to a premature silence/ Where death finds too much use."" Place those lyrics in the shadow of the death of the band's original keyboardist, still fairly fresh in 2002 when this album saw its original Australian release, and they take on other dimensions.</p><p>
    
    Having covered their ground in just two tracks, Augie March set out to refine it and expand it in the 50 or so minutes that follow. ""The Night Is a Blackbird"" is a pretty thing moving at the pace of a Galapagos tortoise, melody upon melody upon melody. ""Up the Hill and Down"" is a horn reverie to introduce ""There's Something at the Bottom of the Black Pool"", which sounds like its title, and ""Addle Brains""? Well, as if the title wasn't already enough, it's a loopy, almost Victorian swinger stuffed as usual with keyboards and character-sketching lines like ""Addle Brains would drink for four days and no eats/ And sleep in the glens of botanical parks/ And on the humped bus shelter seats.""</p><p>
    
    The original Augie March was a character dreamed up by Saul Bellow, a man ""in search of a worthwhile fate,"" and his namesake band, halfway around the world, has nicely found that fate on their second album. Frankly, it's amazing that it took two years for these songs to reach the states-- those folks down in Australia already own an entire continent, so no need to hog the greatest music they produce for themselves as well, right? At any rate, it finally made it here, and is waiting to be heard.</p></div>"|463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/463-strange-bird/|8.2|Joe Tangari

(Although heaven help you if you find yourself crossways with a sanctimonious John Stirratt fan.) Both prior to and concurrent with his time in Wilco, Kotche has lent his uniquely expansive style of percussion to a remarkable array of projects, from solo works to stints playing with such acts as the Boxhead Ensemble, Bobby Conn, the Fred Lonberg-Holm Trio, and Simon Joyner.</p><p>
    Some of Kotche's most adventurous and satisfying activities have been conducted as one half of On Fillmore, his experimental duo with bassist Darin Gray (another guy who's built himself a weird and wondrous discography with his work in bands like Brise-Glace and Dazzling Killmen.) On <i>Sleeps With Fishes</i> the two utilize double bass, vibraphone, and an inscrutable assortment of tuned percussion and field recordings to create a mesmerizing, pointillist topography; one built of tiny sounds that twinkle like the reflection of fireflies upon an ink-black river.</p><p>
    One quick side note: My dog typically ignores all music, usually remaining completely oblivious to whatever crazy sounds might be emanating from my speakers. But for\xCAsome reason <i>Sleeps With Fishes</i> drives her absolutely bananas. The main culprit is the album's first track ""Hikali"", which not only features tapes of what sounds like chirping birds or squirrels but also several bell-like tones that sound, to the unwary, suspiciously like the sound of my doorbell. To the canine mind, all of these collected sounds apparently signal some sort of call to action. Exactly what that action is supposed to entail remains vague, although it certainly seems to require a lot of barking.</p><p>
    Hopefully, however, your human response to <i>Sleeps With Fishes</i> will be more subdued though perhaps just as fervent. With Gray's serenely strolling bass anchoring Kotche's shimmering, melodic vibraphone, tracks like ""Hikali"" and ""Taisho"" can be as tranquil as doing a little nightfishing in your neighbor's koi pond using a set of glow-in-the-dark chopsticks. And invariably each of these songs reach a point where gravity fails and their various pixels can no longer hold together, so maybe you'll decide to just settle right into the pond to enjoy an extended float, with the fish generally well-behaved and nibbling on you only occasionally.</p><p>
    On shorter tracks like ""Showa"" and ""Asagi"", On Fillmore sound slightly more conventional-- their gauzy, pincushion melodies sounding something like miniature versions of Tortoise's gamelan-inspired tapestries. And on the closing ""Doitsu"" they initially slide into a sleek uptown jazz lope, before the song's swirling double-helix structure gradually dissolves into chiming hiss and static, and this beguiling apparition of an album is appropriately permitted to exit with a whisper.</p></div>"|6103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6103-sleeps-with-fishes/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

Clichés about ""auto-erotica"" aside, there is something peculiar about having so many egos become inflated by monotonous basslines.</p><p>
    I thought about this rite when I first played Thomas Fehlmann's second solo album, <i>Lowflow</i>, in my car's time-tattered, circa-1987 stereo. All of its details-- the choral hums, synth spasms, faux Middle Eastern melodies that could charm garter snakes, etc.-- were lost. Only the depth-charge basslines and clanking hip-hop beats were left. The music itself is now German dub as crunk. This treatment is nothing new as labels like ~scape, Merck, and sometimes one too many glitch-hop artists explored that connection. However, Fehlmann's minimalism admirably scrapes out landscapes with charcoal and flicking watercolors here and there. He also hails from over 25 years of importing Detroit techno into Berlin, engineering/producing The Orb's Earth Day acid-picnics, and contributing to the ~scape and Kompakt labels-- all lending further credibility. Oh, that and the fabulous Bob Mackey-style rendering of a pom-pom on <i>Lowflow</i>'s cover, as done by legendary SoCal punk artist Raymond Pettibon.</p><p>
    Opener ""Goldhaar"" sketches the album's template with its Hollywood espionage soundtrack of icepick stabs of bass, drilled brass synths that blurt their name, and an odd, droning medieval choir. The following ""Prefab"" continues the tone, spicing in steadier smacks, some decent Middle Eastern reeds and dolphin-like rattles. The too-brief ""Interstellar"" deftly kicks in the crunk through a vintage German digital-dub jaunt, while the briefer (39-second) ""Intertwine"" hammers junk-metal on the one. Elsewhere, Fehlmann further proves that he did his undergraduate studies on Dirty South hip-hop on ""Intersect"" with its marrow-thin handclaps, but the peculiar time-stretched clavichord tone earns his work a ""B-"". As what's common with quite a few German dub artists these days, he sometimes drops Weather Channel soundtracks that try to spice up coverage of seasonal, partly cloudy and 68-degree weather. The guilty are ""Lindt"" and the overpolished Bill Laswell-style dub of ""Slinky"".</p><p>
    Fehlmann's biggest strength is treating a dub groove like a storm-drain; allowing random detritus to fall into the rainwater and steadily drift along. ""Springer"" resembles a live band jamming along to a busted ghetto blaster; as ham radio transmissions sputter with a looming machina bassline. ""Andrea Is Delighted"" is a year-in-a-day trance that sets a Kompakt-style whirlpool orchestration to a classic Berlin dub strut that flickers like a skyscraper's office lights gone haywire. The closer, ""Fellmaus"" was a leftfield, grime-dub oddity on ~scape's digital-dub comp, <i>Staeditizism</i> (2000) with its spider-spun cymbals wind chime marimbas, and time-mutating rimshots. That track's inclusion on <i>Lowflow</i>  now makes it seem that Fehlmann only gave a 15-percent expression on this album. He's forgiven, but that's quite deadly for a minimalist record.</p></div>"|3025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3025-lowflow/|7.4|Cameron Macdonald

In fact, there's one right on the first track of their debut album <i>Grab That Gun</i>, buried deep beneath the snappy, melody-bearing picked bass that's the first and most conspicuous indication of where this pipe-driven Vancouver quintet derive their sound. Another tip-off is Katie Sketch's yearning, almost Gregorian vocal delivery. Sulky and chorus-laden, opener ""Brother"" nods to a lengthy roster of rockers emeritus: Morrissey, Joy Division, the Shaggs, Interpol, Blondie, and the Cure-- especially the Cure. But ""Brother"" is no microwave dinner: It's the Organ's best song, a glistening fresh-caught tuna of spot-on nostalgia that casts the brightest of <i>Grab That Gun's</i> fast-burning rays.</p><p>
    
    Rarely have I been as excited by eighth notes as I was hearing the opening bars of ""Brother"" anew. Unfortunately, it's something of a bait and switch: <i>Grab That Gun</i> starts with a bang and rides it for the entirety of its brusque 29 minutes. By the end, it's floundering in pallid melodies, stalled and spent after such a brief time. For many bands, Smiths and Joy Division invocations are about cheap thrills and scoring easy points. The Organ's enthusiasm is a bit more sincere-- the band affect their moody aesthetic as if it were a genetically inherited disorder. But accuracy isn't enough to justify a conservative approach. The Organ must convince us that reverb-swollen dirges laced with heart-melting baritone vocals are a fresh dish in 2005.</p><p>
<i>Grab That Gun</i> makes an ambiguous case. On the bright side, songs like ""Brother"" and ""There Is Nothing I Can Do"" follow trails blazed by On!Air!Library! and Interpol, who are among the more progressive-minded purveyors of new wave and post-punk revivalism. ""There Is Nothing"" is this record's obligatory sorrow-stauncher. Sketch is typically heavy, but awash in phased drums and sprightly guitars her voice takes on a more radiant character. ""Sinking Hearts"" is a paradigm of concision, packing a set of swift, seamless melodic maneuvers-- including <i>Grab That Gun's</i> best chorus-- into a stout two minutes.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, however, things feel redundant. Homogenous melodies wash over the album, bleeding into one another and taking on only slightly different hues. The Organ's forebears wrote catchy songs but often grew laborious in their gloom; by contrast, this bunch is much starchier. <i>Grab That Gun</i> strives to resurrect a sound and give it a soft safe spin for posterity's sake, but all it does is take a proven formula that's already been run into the ground and drive it further down. Nestled inside that cozy-- if occasionally fertile-- matrix, they'll have a difficult time making significant ripples.</p></div>"|6083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6083-grab-that-gun/|6.6|Sam Ubl

The music to films like <em>Rushmore</em> complimented a style that's drily bittersweet, and so quirky that his critics say he cushions his blows: the plot devices of giant aquariums and Jaguar sharks are too fantastic, real people don't live in the <em>Franny &amp; Zooey</em> world of <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>, Gene Hackman never comes out and calls Danny Glover a ""nigger,"" and on and on. Meanwhile, the legion of Anderson's fans who dig the quirk also appreciate the understated but real sadness that runs through the films-- the genuine emotion that's fed by botched dreams and unexpected, unremarkable deaths.</p><p> <em>The Life Aquatic</em> with Steve Zissou has proven more exotic and divisive than even <em>Tenenbaums</em>-- check out the 47% fresh rating at Rottentomatoes.com-- and though I'm a diehard Anderson nut, I'm still digesting it, or to paraphrase the old saying, I had trouble seeing the ocean for the millions of brightly-colored, made-up fish. So fittingly, this may be Anderson's most jumbled soundtrack record. <em>The Life Aquatic</em> splits its time between excerpts from the score that are almost too cute, and old rock songs that sound even better than you remembered.</p><p>  The instrumentals take about a third of the album, and they come from both Anderson regular Mark Mothersbaugh and Sven Libaek, whose additions are jazzy and warmly fluid. Libaek's flute propels you more gently than Mothersbaugh's harpsichord, and while Mothersbaugh has the more distinctive style-- and the gorgeous ""Ned's Theme""-- he also sounds like he's writing a score that could either be used by a big-budget movie or by junior high school kids reenacting the same. Sure, that's the point, but it's stronger on the screen.</p><p>  Anderson's soundtracks are most popular for those 1960s and 70s pop songs, as with <em>Rushmore</em>'s resurrection of the Creation's ""Making Time"". This time, along with cuts by Iggy and the Stooges, and Mothersbaugh's old band Devo, he uses two tunes from David Bowie's <em>Hunky Dory</em>, including ""Queen Bitch"" and ""Life on Mars"", the centerpiece of the whole soundtrack. As the strings on the chorus foam over like bubbles from a 50-foot-tall washing machine, Bowie's voice cascades in sublime triumph-- though Anderson probably also picked this tune because of the line about the sailors.</p><p>  When he does retreat to a softer folk cushion, he picks curveballs like Joan Baez's ""Here's to You"" as a love theme, or the Zombies' ""The Way I Feel Inside"", which is so plainly pretty and understated that I couldn't predict how it would be used in the film. Then there's Scott Walker's ""30th Century Man"", a minute-and-a-half of golden-throated absurdity: ""See the dwarves and see the giants/ Which one would you choose to be?/ And if you can't get that together/ Here's the answer, here's the key."" (Was this the inspiration for David Brent's songs on <em>The Office</em>? Wait wait guys, gimme back my critic's license-- I promise I'll never make fun of Scott Walker again.)</p><p>  You can decide for yourself if you want to pay the price of two movie tickets for new Mothersbaugh instrumentals and a handful of classics. But one thing sets <em>The Life Aquatic</em> apart from Anderson's last soundtracks: the five songs by Seu Jorge, who sings acoustic versions of Bowie songs in Portuguese. Jorge appears in the cast-- Americans may recognize him as Knockout Ned from <em>City of God</em>-- and these recordings basically come right from the set, as Jorge strums his guitar around the ship. You could treat these as a novelty, but my only complaint is that they didn't throw in more of them; Jorge's beautiful samba version of ""Rebel, Rebel"" and his vigorous ""Starman"" are the record's real highlights. Like Anderson's movies, they're strange, sweet, and revelatory.</p><p> </p></div>"|7895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7895-the-life-aquatic-with-steve-zissou-ost/|7.1|Chris Dahlen

Perhaps process shouldn't be a determining factor in the opinion of a final product, but nevertheless I respond pretty consistently to Kompakt and Force Tracks and especially Perlon releases in part because the tracks just sound more thought-out and labored over. If anything, they're extremely detailed. Sometimes detail work makes us dance harder, and on rare occasions it can even give a track some unexpectedly human quality: Michelangelo Matos talks about the thread of pessimism that courses through Luomo's <i>Vocalcity</i>, for instance. Whatever gives icy tracks like ""Tessio"" or Jan Jelinek's ""Tendency"" such emotional depth, Fruity Loops definitely doesn't have a preset for it-- at least just yet.</p><p>
    Blame the detail work, the drugs, or the greasy long hair in his eyes: Ricardo Villalobos' <i>Thè au Harem d'Archiméde</i> is the sound of paranoia, a ticking bomb that never quite goes off. Nine well-carved tracks fidget violently within a remarkably controlled spectrum of sound. While tech-house in 2004 widened its scope for bigger sounds, trading computers for synths and hard grooves for genre and song structure, Villalobos approaches <i>Thè au Harem</i> with a monkish, almost classical degree of top-down restraint. It seems as if the Chilean-Berliner sticks to only seven or eight percussive sounds throughout the whole album, running them through every possible permutation, milking them till they're miraculously warm and woozy. Villalobos gave us great hooks on 2003's <i>Alcachofa</i>; here he stalks us in a sweaty haze of Amazon rhythm, challenging us to find the hooks ourselves.</p><p>
    Dizzying and sometimes nerve-wracking, Villalobos is hardly a shyster though, hooking up <i>Thè au Harem</i>'s hardest working listeners with fantastic payoffs throughout the mix. While the first three tracks flaunt grooves as tightly-wound as Maurizio twelves, Villalobos still finds an unsettling amount of wiggle room for wind-chime strings in ""Hireklon"", swashbuckling slurps in ""Serpentin"", and noirish synth accents in ""For All Seasons"". As the album progresses, tracks become livelier and more unpredictable, each building on the rhythmic developments of the one before. Lush pun-on-title-track ""Thèorème d'Archiméde"" is the tipping point, thereafter Villalobos insisting on increasingly chaotic routines: ""Temenarc 2"" spins like a shattered Tiefschwarz record, and follow-up ""Temenarc 1"" all but bats its way out of an aluminum trash can. By the time the aptly-named ""True To Myself"" finishes out Thè au Harem, Villalobos has become quite the derelict, offering 14 minutes of weary chants and ghostly yelps. Think Dani Siciliano in Downtown 81 drag, chasing us through the jungle.</p></div>"|8507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8507-the-au-harem-darchimede/|8.2|Nick Sylvester

But as founder/frontman/Hush label boss Chad Crouch declares, he's sick of being ""nice."" Their earlier records subscribed to lush bossa nova and soothing, acoustic indie rock, cushioning lyrics that, while smart and witty, never had a victim, and never broke the peace. Blanket Music was nice, and Crouch has decided that doesn't play in today's world.</p><p>
    
    Crouch opens with both barrels in ""You Shouldn't Have Said That"", where he threatens a rock critic over a bad review. (Chad, point taken-- but John Zorn's ""Perfume of a Critic's Burning Flesh"" is, y'know, a catchier track.) But after that, Blanket Music's third studio album, <i>Cultural Norms</i>, takes subtler aim at today's ""cultural norms"", from the everyday (fat kids, filesharing, <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>) to the newsworthy: a gay bride or groom waiting to be married by Gavin Newsom, a soldier's eye view of Bush's Thanksgiving press op in Iraq.</p><p>
    
    Although the lyrics are heavier this time, the music is even catchier than <i>Move</i>, from ""I'm Fat,"" where the hook swirls from a Swiss chocolate-flavored accordion, to the Rhodes and horns on ""Guernica"". Building on sweet and simple indie pop in the vein of Belle and Sebastian, Crouch doesn't let a song go by without a great tune and swinging arrangement, aided by members of the Portland indie syndicate including the Decemberists' Chris Funk and Jenny Conlee, Reclinerland's Michael Johnson on Fender Rhodes, and best of all, the rhythm section of bassist Dave Depper and Greg Lind on drums, who bring muscle and class to Crouch's breezy strumming.</p><p>
    
    But if Crouch is sick of ""nice,"" that doesn't mean he's become nasty-- and his best weapon is his frailest: his voice, a thin reed that sounds ragged and vulnerable to the elements. While his vocal style fits the band, his best moments come when he sings a capella, cooly drawing you in by singing in a vacuum. Most of the lyrics take the form of a monologue, and while they're sometimes too literal or limited by their topicality, they catch the confusion and doubts of the characters, who never decide if what they're seeing is wrong. When Crouch is handling topics as serious as war or as banal as wage-slavery, that tact is crucial: He never hits you over the head with an idea, and what better way to bemoan, say, the trivialization of ""Guernica"", Picasso's major statement against facism, than in a song so breezy that you can dance to it a dozen times without ever hearing the lyrics?</p><p>
    
    Crouch understands the difference between getting in people's faces, and inviting them to come to him. This style of indie pop often takes the latter route, making it easy to overlook but that much more seductive. Maybe Crouch feels that in his nicer, earlier days he didn't work hard enough for the limelight, but he easily could have erred in the other direction by pitching headlong into the cultural wars. Instead, he found a perfect balance, and this is his most compelling album.</p></div>"|794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/794-cultural-norms/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

In interviews, he's perennially enthusiastic about unexceptional people and places; about the joys of music for trains, campfire songs, and handholding sing-alongs. His is the rare personality where a Zen-like awareness of the sanctity of the moment, an unremitting gratitude for the gift of existence, and an ostensibly genuine capacity to love strangers are combined into a sort of super-empathy that verges on the grotesque. This deep-seated sensitivity courses sweetly through Anderson's music, which pulls no punches in its pursuit of the bittersweet: Only one song, ""I Was Wrong"", actually has a doleful harmonica, but you can almost hear those spectral strains tacitly bleating over the others.</p><p>
    
    ""Spectral"" is the watchword for <em>The Wreath</em>, which is all about the phantom distance between memory and experience. Anderson is concerned with cataloging what's been lost, what's left behind, and what never was; and with trying to hew meaning from the tropes that float aimlessly through these void spaces. On ""O, Jac!"", a slow-burning lament flickering over a handful of guitar and piano chords, the symbolic language is articulated: an albatross, a bracelet, a noose, a millstone, ""a weird heavy amulet of expectation,"" ghost weights that alchemically transmute the heart from flesh to lead. Like most of the album's more winning songs, it achieves its peak force in its transition from simple quietude to shuddering incandescence, as Anderson trades impassioned cries of ""Where are you?"" with guest vocalist Rachael Jensen.</p><p>
    
    ""If I'm Waiting"" finds Andersen ""slowly embracing the concept of you as a ghost"", a ""never-was and never-will"", as he returns from the thrift store ""to tear through the caller ID"". This is another guitar and piano number embellished with elegiac brass-- ever since Anderson dropped his Wolf Colonel moniker and became self-titled, he's veered away from Guided By Voices style indie rock and toward emo-folk in the vein of Bright Eyes, David Dondero, and Son, Ambulance, all of whom he evokes with remarkable fidelity, down to his confessional / narrative lyrics, his occasional ventures out of key, his penchant for crescendos, swooning blue notes, and febrile vocal vibratos.</p><p>
    
    But in music so intent on preserving the past, nothing can truly disappear, and the old Wolf Colonel still rears his head on lo-fi rockers like ""Citizen's Arrest"" and ""Our Winter"". If it seems odd that someone so attuned to joy sings such gloomy songs, consider what it means to truly love the world and to live with the knowledge that it will all be spirited away. The friction between bliss and the inevitability of bliss's end lies at the heart of <em>The Wreath</em>, a pasteboard carton filled with dog-eared books, a shabby scarf, an unlabelled mix tape, and a sheaf of yellowing letters, holding fast to its secrets in the corner of a bare room. This is mo(u)rning music, where hope and bereavement collide.</p></div>"|443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/443-the-wreath/|7.3|Brian Howe

Hell, even if you're from their hometown of Danbury, Conn., it's likely you've missed them, even though they've been around in various incarnations for more than a decade. There is a chance that you've seen them without realizing it, though they may have been that group of weirdos with sheets over their heads playing incomprehensible, disorganized psych-rock at top volume before Gas Huffer came on. Their frontman, Dan Bunny, would have screeched like a baboon, maybe burned a book or something and quite possibly yelled at you. It might have been ironic, but God only knows these days.</p><p>
<i>Box the Bunny</i>, a four-CD set of everything the Bunnybrains released from 1993 to 2004, is the apotheosis of bizarre, inexplicable reissues, an unbelievably comprehensive career retrospective of a band that in all likelihood very few people care about. They've even scraped together an interminable DVD of poorly filmed, wicked low-fidelity live performances that I watched in its entirety in the name of journalistic integrity. By the time I got to the just plain weird footage of Dan Bunny gyrating naked, covered in soap with his hands in his crotch I wasn't sure what day it was, what was going on, or why I was still forcing myself to watch. In total, it barely has the appeal of a car wreck.</p><p>
    
    But even without the DVD, four CDs is a lot of music, and it's impossible to sit through all of these particular four CDs in one sitting. I've tried it, and it can't be done-- at least not without the aid of hard, hard drugs. Bunnybrains didn't exactly mature with age, and the stomping, chaotic garage-psych jams on the fourth disc, which comprises the <i>Show Me the Bunny</i> album, sounds about as soupy as and actually less developed than the first, which goes all the way back to their 1993 debut album. The basic sound of Bunnybrains is built from a few simple elements-- heavily distorted guitar, pounding drums and sporadic, gruffly shouted vocals, and in fact the last disc is the least diverse and most listless, consisting almost entirely of thrashing guitar feedback, bass strangled in fuzz and flailing crash cymbal (it seems sort of fitting that the band really devolved over the course of their...um, career doesn't quite seem like the right word). The only respites come from Dan's humorous interjections, particularly his verbatim quotation of the countoff intro to Sweet's ""Ballroom Blitz"" in the opener ""Dan Says Alright"", one of the rare songs with no parentheses in the title (most of them have more than one parenthetical [or bracketed] section).</p><p>
    
    The earlier material is more inspired after all, the band actually managed to get Matador to release one of their albums on vinyl, <i>Bunny Brains Easter</i> (one wonders if Gerard Cosloy lost some kind of bet). You get the occasional Andy Kauffman moment like ""(I'm in the) Bucket (Keith)"", where it sounds like the CD is skipping, complete with the noise of the stuck laser, a smattering of answering machine messages from angry neighbors and skits mostly involving college DJs, but it's still pretty universally ponderous stuff, and there's just no way of getting around the fact that a lot of the material just sucks, and even the stuff that's focused enough to leave an impression, like ""Hello (Reset the Single Malt)"" isn't exactly melodic. It also doesn't bother being either accessible or experimental, and frankly, I've seen dozens of bands playing in Connecticut church basements, high school cafeterias and Elks' clubs who were much better, or at least more distinctive.</p><p>
    
    There are a couple of fairly brilliant moments on the first two discs, and in fact if anything is going to make this unwieldy set worthwhile to anyone, it's undoubtedly the best material on these two volumes. ""Drugs No Way"" is an out-and-out fantastic (and sarcastic) PSA featuring schoolkids singing an anti-drug jingle that out of context could be mistaken for a real Nancy Reagan-approved ditty for fifth graders to sing to their parents. ""Jimboogie"" is credible psych in the Tadpoles vein (though not nearly as good as that band), and the two consecutive versions of ""Model Bitch"" that appeared on their first album are stomping, righteously amateur freakouts that hint at real talent unfortunately hidden elsewhere.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to imagine anyone but the most rabid 30 or 40 aficionados of American pop culture arcana and rock so obscure it barely qualifies as underground finding much worth in this nonetheless lovingly compiled collection, even with its (low by collectors' standards) $17 price tag. The sad truth is that this doesn't dig up some underappreciated geniuses or lost classics of Northeastern counterculture. It just puts the output of a willfully, justifiably obscure local band in one place for easy consumption. I suppose there's a place for that, but it's a very limited place, and this set ultimately doesn't reward the investment of time it requires.</p></div>"|1145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1145-box-the-bunny/|2.1|Joe Tangari

Lightbody's straightforward songs about the nuances of grown-up romance moved me more than they did Pitchfork reviewer Stephen ""Doozy"" Deusner, but other publications' breathless <em>Rush of Blood</em> comparisons made me queasy.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, Jeepster has a new distribution deal for Snow Patrol's first two albums, which hadn't been available in the U.S. since 2001. The illicitly downloadable versions of these records-- along with those by side project The Reindeer Section-- were my introduction to Lightbody. Snow Patrol's sophomore release, <em>When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up</em>, somehow slipped under Pitchfork's radar at the time, but nearly all of <em>Final Straw</em>'s defining elements were there: naked, lovelorn lyrics, simple melodies, and the occasional whorls of well-placed noise. Everything, that is, except the faintest echo of Gwyneth Paltrow's beau.</p><p>
    
    Where his band's debut, <em>Songs for Polar Bears</em>, tested out a broad expanse of subject material, <em>When It's All Over</em> finds Lightbody discovering his strength as an observer of relationships. Lightbody's narrator is ever aware of his own faults, watching helplessly as he fucks everything up-- though whether he's slept with his lover's best friend or merely stayed out late without calling, it's hard to say. In ""On/Off"", a subtler precursor to later gems like ""Chocolate"" or ""How to Be Dead"", Lightbody confesses, ""I knew it would hurt you, but not like this."" Lightbody idol Lou Barlow might add, ""I know you're lying, too.""</p><p>
    
    Snow Patrol's debut earned them not a few comparisons to fellow Glaswegians Belle &amp; Sebastian, but the disc also touched upon pre-<em>Parklife</em> Blur (""Starfighter Pilot"") and bizarro hip-hop (the unfortunate ""Absolute Gravity""). On the group's second outing, only airy ""Batten Down the Hatch"" and pensive ""Firelight""-- which features piano from then-labelmate Stuart Murdoch-- have much in common with B&amp;S.; Elsewhere, Snow Patrol's arrangements begin to coalesce into the sound that's won them international fame, from the crunching power chords of opener ""Never Gonna Fall in Love Again"" to the gussied-up Sebadoh verses of shoulda-been-hit ""One Night Is Not Enough"".</p><p>
    
    In retrospect, <em>When It's All Over</em> sounds like a trial run for <em>Final Straw</em>. Lightbody's unsparing eye for interpersonal dynamics and his knack for a hook were already worthy of the Barlow comparisons. But the new album's soaring ""bigness""-- likely influenced by Coldplay's now-ubiquitous arena-pop-- is absent. I miss it. Not much, though.</p></div>"|7305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7305-when-its-all-over-we-still-have-to-clear-up/|7.6|Marc Hogan

Writer-musician Alan Licht once placed the album on his ""minimal top 10"" list, and <i>The Wire</i> recently included <i>Advent</i> alongside Can, the Stooges, and Neu! in a celebration of their all-time favorite riffs. Now Youngs' longtime label Jagjaguwar reissues the album, allowing curious newcomers the easiest opportunity yet to finally catch a glimpse of this uncompromising, highly-individualized work.</p><p>
    
    In his liner notes for this edition, Youngs refers to <i>Advent</i> as ""a record by an intense young man,"" and after a few spins you're unlikely to detect anything that'd persuade you to disagree. Essentially one 41-minute composition divided into three segments, the album's primary distinguishing characteristic is a hypnotic, two-chord piano figure that pulses with limited variation throughout its entirety. This relentless piano phrase is in fact knotted so loosely that to call it a riff almost feels like an overstatement. As the album progresses the piano begins to scarcely resemble a manmade construction at all, seeming instead a simple, erosive fact of the landscape like a constant wind patiently carving an arch into sandstone or the steady drip of cave-water building a stalactite.</p><p>
    
    Over the course of the album, Youngs proceeds to stage three offensives against this piano's impenetrable bulwarks. On Part I he makes his approach wielding only his plaintive vocals, repeatedly pleading ""don't fall apart,"" in a manner that suggests he's not directly addressing anyone outside his own skull. Though Youngs' vocals have been frequently (and accurately) compared to those of Robert Wyatt, there is also a lonesome quaver in his singing here that recalls Jandek, a resemblance perhaps made more obvious by Youngs' recent and unprecedented live collaboration with the elusive Corwood Industries representative.</p><p>
    
    After that nagging, imperturbable piano emerges from Part I unscathed, Youngs brings out the heavy artillery on Parts II and III. On II he performs extensive surgery (without an anesthetic) on a diseased oboe or two, conjuring a variety of unearthly noises from every sector of the instrument's established range and beyond. Though abrasive, this caterwauling does open a nice hole in the roof to escape through as the claustrophobic walls of piano continue to press in. And the hinges are torn off completely on the 18-minute Part III when Youngs finally resorts to a full frontal electric guitar assault. Forgoing any actual recognizable notes, his guitar unleashes rapturously anarchic sheets of sound, filling the air with red sparks as he sharpens and bends all his blades in a futile attempt to overtake the unyielding piano. Though its harsh and heady minimalism undoubtedly makes <i>Advent</i> a demanding listen (and a potential room-clearer if played amongst the wrong crowd) it remains the most potently concentrated document of Youngs' peculiar and captivating talents.</p></div>"|8843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8843-advent/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

With its discarded trees, glacial lines of benevolent givers at returns and exchanges counters at every shop in the temple, and the beginning of the final week before New Year's-- six days to reflect upon how much you aged and how little you accomplished -- somehow ""Boxing Day"" just doesn't cut it.</p><p>
    
    Until Hallmark designates that day of peace and anticlimax, Parisian ""mutant disco"" label ZE offers two fitting carols from <i>ZE Xmas Record Reloaded 2004</i>, a record on which the resurrected label continues reissuing its Reagan-era backlog of ""no wave"" and avant-disco comps by throwing together its various Xmas Records into one disc. Was (Not Was)'s ""Christmas Time in Motor City"" only sees holiday joy on the Rudolph and snowman paper cut-outs tacked above the window for the welfare office. ""I can't even remember seeing Santa Claus!"" they group-pout to a Funkadelic metal-strut. Yet one bandmate vaguely recalls seeing St. Nick in the unemployment line, and queuing for soup at a shelter that'll 86 him for visiting too many times. Midway through the track, a poet interrupts and reminisces about spending his Christmas feeding pigeons and watching traffic mosey by while hearing ""Silent Night"" on a donut shop radio.</p><p>
    
    This routine of feeling ostracized from the Somebodies also drives Alan Vega's gothic R&amp;B; ballad, ""No More Christmas Blues"". The Suicide frontman perfectly exhales his undead Elvis persona, whimpering and mumbling like an alleyway drunk aglow with red and green Times Square neon: ""This year is going to be different/ I ain't going to be so broke/ I'm going to smile, smile and smile"".</p><p>
    
    Many of the artists here either attempt to pay the bills with easy listening AOR jingles or pout in a corner. Guess which songs make this record worthwhile to buy in July? On ""Things Fall Apart"", Cristina reminisces about broken Christmas tree angels, absentee boyfriends, and parties where nobody knew her name. ""I went back to my flat and wept a bit and fed my cat,"" she concludes over queasy new wave chords. Giving that glum premise a <i>Cathy</i> touch is the Waitresses' ""Christmas Wrapping"". Here, Patty Donahue of ""I Know What Boys Like"" 15-minute fame delivers a dry, schmaltzy reciting of her Christmas letters of ""low and behold"" moments. No Wave tweeker icon James White is a complete bastid as his ""Christmas with Satan"" attests. He imagines hell as the perfect escape from the Christmas hype with a brass section that parodies classic carols and Jewish folk songs with a mouth full of bile and bourbon.</p><p>
    
    White's mockery is a relief after so much AOR dreck on <i>ZE Xmas</i>. I'll keep it short and painless: synth-funk that bends its knees to look funky at an office party (Lisi's ""My Silent Night""); a Brian Wilson homage at Disneyland (Miss OD &amp; Gentlemen League's ""Bells of Christmas""); auto-pilot cheer for when you open your credit-card bills (Lio, Helena Noguerra &amp; Marie France's ""Sleigh Ride""); and John Denver's muppet ghost (Davitt Sigerson's ""It's a Big Country"").</p></div>"|2029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2029-ze-xmas-record-reloaded-2004/|7.0|Cameron Macdonald

In 2002 and 2003, he toured the U.S. and Europe with Cul de Sac as his backing band, but the method conformed to Suzuki's ""instant composition"" dictum: hours after meeting each other for the first time, Suzuki and Cul de Sac played their first show together.</p>
<p>Abhayamudra collects 11 long pieces from those tours, most of which     range between nine and 20 minutes. Supposedly Suzuki rang up Cul de Sac     after hearing one of their albums, and it's not surprising he heard     something in the band that he could work with. Early 70s Can is a huge influence on Cul de Sac, and on record they periodically break out an uncanny impersonation of Holger &amp; Co. (see ""Tailing the Strangler"" from the     <i>Strangler's Wife</i> soundtrack). In spirit, if not quite sound, we'll probably never get closer than this to a reunion of Suzuki-era Can.</p>
<p>Though ""instant composition"" seemingly could lead to chaos, many of these     tracks are quite orderly and structured. Cul de Sac's monster rhythm section     of Jonathan LaMaster (bass) and Jon Proudman (drums) give the upbeat pieces     shape, becoming the hulking mass at the center around which the other     players orbit. The opening ""Beograd 1"" has a thrusting beat reminiscent of     Eno's ""Third Uncle"" (which, of course, owed a lot to Can) as Glenn Jones lets     his guitar bleed feedback all over the tightly measured rhythms. Soaring     above it all is Suzuki, ranting at the sky like he's back busking in Munich.     Suzuki is really more of a riff-based singer, shrieking out short phrases of     sound (don't recognize much here in terms of words) that always exist in     direct relation to what the other musicians are doing.</p>
<p>On rocking tracks like ""Beograd 1"" and ""Berlin 3"" (where Proudman displays     his perfect Jaki Leibezeit tone) the record's promise is realized, and the result is an infectious sense of creative alchemy that can only be described in     spiritual terms. For minutes at a time, years of the far-out new ageisms     Suzuki has spouted in interviews make perfect sense. But balancing out     these sublime moments are a few impressionist soundscape pieces that seem to     drag forever. On ""Baltimore 5"" Cul de Sac quivers quietly in the background,     spinning out the occasional guitar arpeggio from the cloud of cymbal wash,     while Suzuki, mixed too high, babbles on and on.</p>
<p>That's the nature of experimentation; sometimes you wind up with a     pile of broken beakers and noxious gasses stinking up the lab. You still     have to hand it to Suzuki for staying on his utterly unique path for this     long, and to Cul de Sac for continuing to challenge themselves. They could     be making easier choices at this point in their respective careers, but that     would keep them from <i>Abhayamudra</i>'s occasional moments of bliss.</p></div>"|1688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1688-abhayamaudra-with-damo-suzuki/|6.3|Mark Richardson

With <i>The Secret Migration</i>, the band completely deserts the peculiarities that distinguished them from both peers and progeny in favor of a dull collection of pastoral fantasias that frequently wander dangerously close to adult contemporary.</p><p>
    
    OK, so nobody expects another <i>Boces</i> from Mercury Rev, but a reasonable derivation of <i>Deserter's Songs</i> or even <i>All Is Dream</i> would be more than what they've offered this time around. Abstaining from the bowed saw or flute solos and startling tempo changes that made previous efforts not only engaging but inestimably influential, <i>Migration</i> is a relatively dry collection of soft-psych fairytales that wouldn't sound out of place whispering through the speakers of a ponytailed yoga instructor. Particularly troubling is ""Black Forest (Lorelei)"", a prolonged dungeon-master's come-on with its checkout counter mysticism and drowsy instrumentation. Singer Jonathan Donahue asks, ""If I were a white horse/ And offered you a ride/ Through a black forest."" Well Jonny, I'd smack you on the ass and give you a good spurring to fire you up a bit. ""Across Yer Ocean"" is similarly lite in both expression and execution, with new age synths and fretless bass triggering a narcoleptic reaction first acquired thanks to repeated Sting marathons at Mom's house.</p><p> 
    
    Elsewhere, the results are less laughable but just as uninspired. ""In the Wilderness"", a pounding inquisition, has been done better both by Mercury Rev and Doves. ""In a Funny Way"" turns Phil Spector's ""Be My Baby"" into a hippie husband's anniversary song. ""The Climbing Rose"" unfortunately will come out post-Arcade Fire and cannot match their emotional intensity, supplanting it with a more generic ode to spousal support.</p><p>
    
    The face-savers on <i>Secret Migration</i> are ironically the sparest arrangements. ""My Love"", ""First-Time Mother's Joy (Flying)"", and closer ""Downed Poured the Heavens"" isolate Donahue's delicate vocals by eliminating everything but a McCartney-esque plodding piano chord, creeping guitar vines, and a simple shuffle of the drums. This trio of songs indicates the band's potential divergence from their pals in the Flaming Lips who successfully segued from thrashy psych-punk to acid-washed epics on <i>Soft Bulletin</i> and <i>Yoshimi</i>, all under the watchful eye of Dave Fridmann. Though on <i>Migration</i>, Fridmann's trademark glisten is almost too clean, too precious, sterilizing songs dedicated to personified insects and hugging trees.</p><p>
    
    The disappointment of the album is as much due to an apparent complacency in the songwriting as it is to any sense of nostalgia for what Mercury Rev has done on previous landmarks. The breadth of their influence spans over much of the current indie and mainstream heartthrobs, and that status should be a liberation for a band that made its name on its aggressive experimentation. For the first time, they seem content to sit back instead of lean forward. If that's the case, if Mercury Rev intend to hole up in the Catskills and make front porch music, they'd be better off giving up the schmaltzy mushroom rock and focusing on the noises they can actually make on the front porch.</p></div>"|5237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5237-the-secret-migration/|5.5|Peter Macia

The wind blows the sound away, and the sand flows over the writing. A journalist has impact on his time, if he's lucky."" Sadly, for many of us at Pitchfork, our brand of journalism is often reduced to pounding sand and pissing in the wind-- particularly where metal is involved. With metal, so much effort goes into pasteurizing the product, congealing an intrinsically harsh and offensive form of expression into G-rated drivel, that our wind swallows the sound. What results seldom resembles the melodic and thematic content of sometimes brilliant modern metal albums, and instead focuses on the critic's unquenchable need for primal screams directed at a genre he/she simply doesn't get.</p><p>
    
    I've been away from journalism for the better part of two years. In that time I've sat back and stiffly scrutinized the metal landscape. So much of what I've witnessed is offensive-- both in the arenas of music and music criticism. I've seen dozens of rudderless bands ebb and flow, milking the same old derivative metal props for all they're worth. I've seen an entire genre (black metal) continue its decade-long decay into a wretched puddle of milky white afterbirth. And most notably, I've watched scores of pseudo frat boys reinvent themselves as ""metalheadz."" Whether it's the crystal meth or $10 dollar cases of PBR, these guys have tons of energy, a healthy appreciation for Terrence McKenna, and above all else, a whole lot of noise to make.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately for these clowns-- and more so for the ""journalists"" who lap up this rubbish-- this wolf in American Eagle clothing is little more than the noise of hyperactive brats. Ample time is spent bemoaning the aesthetics of the so-called true metal as puerile, obsolete, and anachronistic, and at the same time lauding the dubious originality of bands like Isis, Pelican, and Neurosis, who seemingly missed the whole point in the first place by latching onto the very unmetal aesthetic of putting their audience to sleep.</p><p>
    
    And then a band like Mastodon comes along and just clusterfucks the entire landscape for every indie kid who thought they had the whole scene pegged. Starting with their ironically acclaimed 2002 release <i>Remission</i>, Mastodon's Bill Kelliher, Troy Sanders, Brent Hines, and Brann Dailor displayed considerable technicality and staggering chops. Although initially loathed by yours truly, I eventually recognized this album as a turgid-- occasionally murky-- statement from one of the most relentlessly forceful young bands on the Relapse roster.</p><p>
    
    With their 2004 beast, the aptly titled <i>Leviathan</i>, Mastodon finally find their niche as a thinking man's metal band. Blending Voivod's neuro-thrash, Therion's majestic gloom, Morbid Angel's spirit of restless and morphing liquid black melody, and EyeHateGod's Southern rock gone awry, <i>Leviathan</i> is nothing short of supernatural. Evincing a decade's worth of maturity gained in just two short years, Mastodon have authored a bombastic modern interpretation of Herman Melville's <i>Moby Dick</i>, the classic metaphor for mortality's eternal (and unwinnable) struggle with divine injustice.</p><p>
    
    On tracks like the blistering ""I Am Ahab"", the band revels in one of its most tightly structured offerings to date, showing precision and patience roaring with power chords and drummer Brann Dailor's mastery of playing both within and around the groove. With the fusion of guitar stabs and snare hits assaulting the listener like a hammer to the skull, the track evokes the unquenchable vengeance and contempt of Melville's symbolic white whale in a little over two-and-a-half minutes.</p><p>
    
    ""Iron Tusk"" is a particularly resonant ode to Sabbath's raw sludge rock sound; another swollen groove that just grows and flows in circles and waves. What's most impressive about this album is evidenced here: Mastodon have learned how to flaunt their musicianship and still allow a song to evolve. Their confidence is such that they're quite capable of building an awesome wall of drone and harmony and then getting the fuck of its way. Where a band like Isis seems to content to treat the audience like morons and basically repeat the same sound over and over again until it's nothing more than glorified elevator music, Mastodon stumbled onto the delicate art of weaving complexity and sophistication within an audience-respectful format.</p><p>
    
    ""Megaladon"" is an ode to the mythos of early 80s Maiden and Diamond Head-- and a simultaneous tip of the cap to Molly Hatchet with a wonderfully idiosyncratic, and damn near arbitrary trailer park riff before going into full throttle thrash for the remainder of the track. Fusing the narrative trademarks of King Crimson and Slayer, ""Naked Burn"" is one of the more beautiful pieces of Leviathan, a shifting, swaying exercise in orchestration and intelligible vox within a metal format. Marking a stark contrast with <i>Remission</i>, ""Hearts Alive"" continues Mastodon's revisitation of the new wave of British heavy metal-- and homage to the mysticism of the Viking Metal movement-- by unleashing a sweeping 13-minute epic, briefly featuring some of their most gentle vocals to date. Indeed, the addition of actual sung vocals-- while often suicidal to other metal bands-- lends a coherence and humanity to <i>Leviathan</i> basically alien to <i>Remission</i>.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, there's very little to dislike about Mastodon. The genesis from their marginal 2001 EP <i>Lifesblood</i> to present day has been nothing short of stunning, and I can't imagine why anyone with even half an interest in the preservation of metal as a legitimate art form doesn't have a copy of <i>Leviathan</i> on his shelf. These guys aren't part of the tedious mediocrity they've been lumped in with, nor do they hold any contempt for their audience or their forefathers. They're simply one of the best things we metal fanatics have going for us, and if that's not reason enough to toss <i>Panopticon</i> in the trash, I don't know what is.</p></div>"|5143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5143-leviathan/|8.5|Isaiah Violante

It even featured a few appearances from Suede's Brett Anderson, no stranger to glamor and bombast. Needless to say, it was a departure from the pensive, reclusive noises Stina was best known for, and if this snippet from her online bio (written in prose, but laid out on the screen as a free verse poem) is any indication, it wasn't a welcome departure:</p><p>
    
    ""For so long Stina Nordenstam appeared to be running away. Like escape itself became the destination. Her music was homeless because that's what she wanted it to be. Albums were recorded in Los Angeles; musicians were flown in from all over the world, silly amounts were spent on photo sessions in New York. Until the only constant was her voice.""</p><p>
    
    For <i>The World Is Saved</i>, Stina returned home, writing and recording the record in Stockholm, employing Swedish musicians-- including jazz trumpeter Goran Kajfes and Ken Vandermark collaborator Johan Berthling-- and even setting up her own record label (A Walk in the Park) to issue the record. (A slightly larger recording concern, V2 Records, is co-releasing this album with Stina's modest conglomerate.) As you might imagine, the result of this cautious and introspective effort is a cautious and introspective record. Complex instrumental arrangements abound, and there are plenty of moments where wry humor and sobering truths flourish, but space and silence dominate.</p><p>
    
    As her biography attests, Stina's voice remains a constant throughout her work, whether she's abetted by hyper-processed bells and attenuated whistles or alone with a guitar and studio ambiance. For example, take these lyrics from the first song off the album, ""Get on With Your Life"": ""They put a needle once in my spine/ It took them so long to find it/ I can't get this porn film out of my head/ Let's get on with it.""</p><p>
    
    Stina seemingly enjambs the first two lines when she sings them but pauses midway through the second line, after ""it took them"". Nearly a full measure goes by before she finishes the line. She turns this trick again in the second verse, stopping on the word ""love"" and then, after a few beats, finishing the thought-- ""dies every second"". It's a small detail, but it undoubtedly unsettles the listener. Beyond the way she handles the words, there's the way she sings them, voicing them in a bleached cracking mewl-- at once distraught and disinterested. She doesn't hold notes, there's no melisma or scale exercises, no multi-octave pyrotechnics. She sings the way a 10-year-old girl would sing-- if the 10-year-old had a sore throat and was afraid to annoy her parents.</p><p>
    
    To folks unfamiliar with Stina's work, this seemingly juvenile style of singing could be off-putting. However, an interesting thing happens halfway through this song, around the end of the second verse. When the orchestra-- to this point reticent and timid-- in the background of the chorus decides to gingerly enter the fray with pensive tremulous notes, Stina's recessed wisp of a voice is imbued with a fragile resonance. There are examples of this throughout this album, and her other records as well, and it's what sets her apart from other singers-- she manages to convey a range of nuanced emotions by foregoing superficial emoting, which is no easy feat.</p><p>
    
    In many ways, it's better that she avoids any demonstrative flourishes. The second song on the album, ""Winter Killing"", an incisive portrait of a love triangle-- the narrator is distancing herself from her lover (and her lover's wife)-- wouldn't be nearly as effecting in the throat of a different singer. At first, it seems as though the narrator's departure is a selfishly selfless gesture: I was stopped in customs/ Quite proud of the knack/ I have of knowing/ When it's over.""</p><p>
    
    The narrator takes pride in the distance she's created, insisting ""You're safer with me here/ And you there"". And then, near the end of the song-- against a sparser version of the song's syncopated backdrop-- this bravado is revealed to be a faltering facade: ""You'd made a lover out of me/ And spring was coming."" Instead of her moving away for his sake, she's doing it to keep herself from feeling anything: ""I'm safer with me here/ And you there"". Stina's voice presents this confession in a calm matter-of-fact fashion that belies its devastating impact.</p><p>
<i>The World Is Saved</i> is filled with these sardonic moments. Most of them are a result of Stina's lyrics juxtaposed not only with her voice but atypical musical settings as well. You find yourself sitting on a gorgeously mournful trumpet refrain? Make it into a song about writing snarky postcards to your ex-lover (""From Grand Cayman With Love"")! You want to recast Gregor Samsa as a butterfly instead of a cockroach (""Butterfly"")? Do it with this jaunty toe-tapping junk-driven jalopy! As for the title track, why not use plucked strings, craggy violin bowing, and rumbling xylophones to gleefully pervert the title's sentiment?</p><p>
    
    From the sound of this record, salvation came at a high price. The stories Stina tells, and the means she uses to tell them, paint extraordinary portraits born of hard lessons and harder struggles. If-- as her bio claims-- ""this is some of the most hopeful music"" Stina Nordenstam has ever recorded, it's a sinewy, ragged hope. Even after all that she's been through, there is something to look forward to. ""Yet I hold nothing/ In my arms but my arms"". For better or worse, and with all due apologies to her previous work, this is Stina Nordenstam.</p></div>"|5909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5909-the-world-is-saved/|8.6|David Raposa

Right after the Y2K Bug was a dud and modern civilization realized that it didn't have to organize militias to defend top ramen and Wonderbread supplies, Frankfurt electronica label Mille Plateaux announced its ""first genre"" of the 21st century.</p><p>
<i>Clicks_+_Cuts</i> was their vanguard-- a compilation of artists romancing the glitch or, ahem, intentional accidents with their audio software. The triple-disc <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts 2</i> and Mille Plateaux's tragically underrated <i>Electric Ladyland: Click-Hop Version 1.0</i> kept the street festival alive for the entire year of 2001, branching off into the virgin lands of microhouse and digital slapstick.</p><p>
    And then came the butcher's bill. As revolutions usually go, the <i>CC</i> aged in dog years and died of natural causes. A funeral wake followed within two years when Mille Plateuax dared to release <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts 3</i>. It seemed that the once almighty label began venturing into a marketing firm for Motorola cell phones, cologne, and breath-fresher gum; concocting soundtracks ripe for ladies in off-white unisex bodysuits lounging in matching rooms. The curiosities and mysteries were over.</p><p> 
    Mille Plateaux had great nerve to revive the <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> series with this fourth volume. Yet, most of its music is terribly comforting. Much of the <i>CC</i> regulars here seemingly draw from the same well of ideas-- Morse Code beats, menthol-lit, jazz organ harmonies, and locust symphonies of clickey-klack glitches. Nonetheless, there is scant homogeny-- it's more of a DJ mix that drizzles time with much breathing space. Frank Elting's ""Spoken Word"" opens with a lackluster, humidifier lounge number. The following ""Got Mad Love"" by Micronost is more promising with a crunk tune that vaguely recalls M's white-bread disco hit, ""Pop Muzik"". Eight Frozen Modules' ""Dogsbark People Grow"" then grooves with coagulated synth harmonies flailing like double-jointed limbs, and a foghorn Rhodes organ blaring hopeless warnings.</p><p>
    The majority of <i>CC 4</i> explores rain-strewn digital decay and the melancholy that entails. Electric Birds' soothing ""When I See the Sun"" ka-thunks along with confused satellite signals and a solarized guitar tone that steams through gutters. Tilman Ehrhorn's ""Clear"" ventures into the loop-jazz territory that is well-staked by Jan Jelinek. Yet, the song is somehow imbued with a greater scope as its digital static sways like birch branches; it bleeds into the amniotic digital-dub of Jay Haze's ""Too Good"" that recalls Vladislav Delay's glory days. Twerk and Thomas Brinkmann toy with oddball field recordings of Japanese chatter. The former's ""Haiiro"" sheds some Rhodes tears whilst a shaving session and a conversation between a Japanese man and kid, the latter's ""Decoupe"" enters an alleyway full of annoyed shouting, offset by some peculiar Geiger Counter funk. Ultra-red's utterly surreal ""Neue Wirtschaft (Freedom of Movement)"" begins with a sample of a rally speaker stressing the importance of defying privatized space, and then falls into spastic microfunk.</p><p>
    I wish <i>CC 4</i> had a cliffhanger ending such as Bizz Circuits' stroboscope horrorshow ""Ghetto Ambient"" instead of Håkan Libdo's anemic dub shrug, ""Lebensformen"". Sebastian Meissner (Bizz) boils a Middle Eastern orchestra in raw diesel, causing it to jitter for dear life, cutting it off when the tension sinks the soul, and proving there is still some kick left in glitch. </p></div>"|1936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1936-clicks-cuts-4/|7.8|Cameron Macdonald

It's so broad as to render the very term avant garde meaningless as a descriptor, and yet we still know it when we hear it. Yannis Kyriakides and Andy Moor come from different zones of that spectrum, Kyriakides the formal world of electronic composition and Moor the wild world of art punk (with the Ex) and large ensemble free jazz (Corkestra), but their basic desire to color outside the lines is fraternal enough that the two have not only founded the Unsounds label together, they've also recorded an album together for their imprint.</p><p>
    
    The setup is simple: Kyriakides does live programming and sound manipulation while Moor plays guitar and fiddles with a radio. The effect is something approaching minimalism, but too active to fully qualify-- it's actually quite similar the Gilbert/Lewis Wire side project Dome, and anyone who enjoyed that duo's third and fourth albums in particular is quite likely to enjoy this as well. Ex fans looking for an extracurricular fix might find themselves as puzzled as many Wire fans were after hearing Dome. But Moor's trademark six-ton razor-blade attack never makes itself known here-- instead he uses the instrument percussively or stretches out string noise to blend with Kyriakides' static-electric buzzes, twitters and crunches.</p><p>
    
    The guitar sounds as if it's being torn asunder on ""Eel"", a track that stretches and distorts the sound of knocking on the strings into a miniature replica of a black hole. On the other side of that singularity, ""Little Bittern"" is the sound of guitar leaking through a pinhole in the roof, dropping a particle at a time amid trebly buzzing and electronic sloshing noises. While some tracks are haunting, a few are too shapeless to do much harm, and tracks like ""Possible Wheels""-- which drags fumbling percussive sounds out over four-and-a half-minutes-- are the most amoebic. It's these tracks that draw the album a bit past its welcome, but they're very little harm done overall.</p><p>
    
    The reward for making it past ""The Eye on Its Side"" is great, however: the 10-minute closer ""Nocturnal"" is a haunting, suspenseful piece of music built around low-level string noise and a steadily tolling bass tone that sounds like the sort of timbre Harry Partch might have dreamed up on one of his oddball marimbas. It's a stunning conclusion that makes for the album's most affecting (the effect, in this case, being a profound fear of going into dark rooms) moment. <i>Red v Green</i> is a relentlessly abstract affair, but it still manages to get inside you more than many similar records, and it's a fascinating meeting point for two very different constituents of the modern avant garde.</p></div>"|4592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4592-red-v-green/|7.1|Joe Tangari

The syllogism goes: Stones Throw is a hip-hop label. Koushik Ghosh is on Stones Throw. Therefore, Koushik is hip-hop. Seems cogent enough. But let me tell you, friend-- this doesn't sound much like hip-hop to me. Koushik doesn't rap; he breathily sings, and <em>Be With</em> is more about gauzy collages of ephemeral melodies than hot beats. But, hey, it's on Stones Throw, got to be hip-hop. Genres are tricky like that. Cex made hip-hop safe for Radiohead fans by pretending it was indie rock. If Stones Throw signed Coldplay, would they then become hip-hop? It's a side issue anyway; let's paddle back to shallow waters before it gets any metaphysicaler up in here...</p><p>
<em>Be With</em> collects three vinyl EPs onto one compact disc: Not so hot for DJs, but top-slot for casual listeners. The first four tracks on the album are taken from an upcoming twelve-inch EP of the same name. The middle tracks are from Koushik's 2003 Stones Throw debut, <em>One in a Day</em>, and the final four are from his 2001 Text Records seven-inch, <em>Battle Times</em>.</p><p>
    
    Koushik is a talented producer who's crafted remixes for high profile friends like Four Tet and Manitoba. He cobbles together frugal astral jazz, gentle funk, and 60s pop and folk using an array of keyboards and samplers-- and it's nice. But it frequently fails to transcend nice, leaving behind a scanty impression. Thus does this amalgam of temporally diverse EPs wind up weirdly blank in its total effect. It stretches out in a long, foggy procession of pleasant monotony-- soothing yet mundane aural wallpaper.</p><p>
    
    That said, Koushik's newest material is his strongest, and one understands that the first two EPs were the product of a nascent musician finding his feet. They're spotty, but the third is consistently engaging, beginning with the title track, which reveals Koushik's favorite suspension: Hip-hop drums, a funk bass line, poppy acoustic guitar, jazzy melodic trills and sighing vocals (My Bloody Valentine type shit y'all). The brief ""Homage"" is more typical IDM fare, but displays Koushik's knack for pairing charming melodies with assertive, variegated drum patterns to good effect. And ""Pretty Soon"" begins as a pretty standard folk song (a pretty bleak one at that: ""Pretty soon I'll be ready to die"", Koushik sings in his monochromatic lilt), but quickly accumulates clattering sound effects that conceal this traditional core.</p><p>
    
    The two earlier EPs hold to this formula, but tend to be heavier on drone and lighter on detail: Koushik had yet to achieve the clarity of vision evinced by the new material, and the songs blur one into the next without his current aptitude for effectively juxtaposing soft and hard sounds. But there are still bright, flashing instances amid the filler, and it has to be mentioned that the album's most exciting song is from the first EP-- ""Battle Rhymes for Battle Times"". The track is brocaded with screwball raygun zaps, brassy jazz embellishments, one of Koushik's least tedious vocal performances, and absolutely explosive drums, making the meandering <em>Bitch's Brew</em>isms of the following song, ""Younger Than Today Part 1"", more frustrating. Koushik is hit-or-miss, but his misses aren't disagreeable-- they're simply lackluster. The progression of these EPs shows him tipping toward the hit side of the equation, and I expect Koushik will continue to refine his strengths and downplay his weaknesses on future recordings.</p></div>"|4591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4591-be-with/|6.8|Brian Howe

And you probably figured out that unreleased material sounded rough and raw, all those songs saturated in reverb and tape hiss. And you knew scattered among that scattered archive-- long stepped over, or used as coasters for countless beers, or as ashtrays, or piled 10 high for footprops-- there were bound to be a few gems. You were, more or less, right all along, as these two mini-biographies from the band's original label, Darla Records, attest; both are subtitled ""early recordings, b-sides, covers, y mas"" (that's if I'm reading the scribbles along the spines correctly), which is an adequate product description, albeit one that omits a few live versions, several alternate takes, some half-assed doodles, tape experiments, and distractions on a bored Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Most of these songs, as you could probably guess, feature just Jim James, the voice of My Morning Jacket, either strumming a guitar or playing rudimentary drum rhythms. He ostensibly compiled these tracks for Darla and divided them onto two separate disks. The first, <i>Chapter 1: The Sandworm Cometh</i>, almost has the easy flow of a proper album, beginning with the relatively polished ""Weeks Go By Like Days"", a full-band track from the <i>Darla 100</i> comp and ending with a faithful cover of Elton John's ""Rocket Man"", which is particularly affecting here because James sounds like he's singing from the void of outer space.</p>
<p>In between those two stellar tracks are alternate takes of ""They Ran"" and ""Evelyn Is Not Real"", which would end up My Morning Jacket's debut, The Tennessee Fire, with better arrangements; strong rarities like ""I Just Wanted to Be Your Friend""; some strange, short doodles (""What Will I Do?"" and ""Isobella With the White Umbrella""); a fuzzed-out version of Jefferson Airplane's ""White Rabbit""; and, best of all, a ragged rendition of Santo &amp; Johnny's ""Sleepwalk"" that leads into a live, slowed-down version of the <i>Tennessee Fire</i> track ""Olde Sept. Blues"". Surprisingly, the collection holds together remarkably well as you glimpse the band's creative process through its discarded recordings.</p>
<p><i>Chapter 2: Learning</i> is even more scattershot, both in its songs and in its tracklist. That subtitle is very likely a disclaimer, a tongue-in-cheek caveat to fans who might otherwise expect too much. The demo versions of album tracks like ""Just One Thing"" and ""Death Is the Easy Way"" anchor this volume, but other tracks uproot it. The three frontloaded covers are straightforward, but unlike ""Rocket Man"", they're also unimaginative and almost unlistenable. James peppers the band's straightlaced reading of Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"" with sound clips from Top Gun, which apparently passes for clever. That song is followed by an even greater disaster, an almost note-for-note cover of ""West End Girls"", on which James mimics Neil Tennant's half-spoken delivery without displaying the slightest awareness of the Pet Shop Boys' devastating decadence.</p>
<p>But covers are half-serious undertakings anyway, especially on a hodgepodge compilation like this, and besides, James' rendition of ""Dream a Little Dream"" is almost charming-- that is, until he starts puppy-whimpering at the end. Similarly, the full-band version of Hank Williams' ""Why Don't You Love Me"" is a hoot until the drum solo coda, which in the liner notes James calls ""Hot!"" but which might be better described as ""Incredibly annoying!"" This percussive sound spoils ""Nothing 2 Me"" as well, burying a signature My Morning Jacket melody under six feet of reverby drums. This sort of self-sabotage can often sound fascinating if it serves a larger purpose, but here it sounds self-indulgent, juvenile, and-- quite frankly-- openly hostile, as if James is daring you to keep listening. Granted, he gives you good reason to endure all the shrill noise with songs like the live version of ""Bermuda Highway"" and ""I Will Be There When You Die/Sunrides and the Girls Scream"", but that only seems to make the lesser songs all the more grating.</p>
<p>At their worst-- which is much of <i>Learning</i>-- these two hodgepodge volumes will interest only the die-hardest of fans, those who probably already own the Darla comps and the European-only EPs. But at their best-- which is most of <i>The Sandworm Cometh</i>-- they offer a compelling if not altogether listenable chronicle of a band with an already prickly creativity and only a nascent idea of what works and what doesn't.

And Arthur Russell's legacy has never been richer for it.</p><p>
    This year's mass rediscovery and mythologization of the late Russell-- an Iowan who seemed to be swinging on a tire over the Mississippi, even when in downtown Manhattan-- was remarkable. Russell's various projects-- including Dinosaur L, Indian Ocean, and Loose Joints-- got feted as textbook examples of ""mutant disco."" His disco was pure clay-- bending, scraping, and glazing its rhythms, harmonies, and vocal arrangements into permanently incomplete sculptures for DJs to puzzle over. Nonetheless, he could still hypnotize dancefloors with dozens of anxious ideas that in the 1980s-- after 1979's white flight from disco-- could only have stemmed from the NYC underground.</p><p>
    Soul Jazz's definitive primer, <em>The World of Arthur Russell</em>, and Audika's studio vault dump <em>Calling out of Context</em> both garnered this very obtuse man some retro dignity, for good or ill. Audika now thankfully reissues <em>World of Echo</em>-- a collection of almost deconstructed, ""rough draft"" versions of his singles-- in a limited-edition package with a few b-sides and a DVD of music videos and concert footage. Recorded between 1980 and 1986-- the year in which the collection was originally released-- this material still sounds timeless. It's also Russell's most personal and radical statement: Here, he isn't cloaked in any congas and hi-hats, shouting divas, or ring-a-ding-ding Latin keyboards. It's just his folksy, muppet tenor, cello, and scant electronic microtones-- all lathered with echo, distortion, and reverb.
    </p><p>
    On these tracks, Russell creates beatless dance music that travels through outer space, making the journey his destination. His onomatopoeias and string-work are uncannily percussive and seem to be faintly picked up by radio satellite. His improvisations mine every conceivable sound from his bow and cello's amplified body: hollow thuds, window-washing brushes, chipped strings, knuckled knacks, and the boom of a floor peg dropping on concrete. However, the instrument startlingly duets with his voice, as it breathes along with him and clears its throat during his awkward moments. Whatever lyrics can be understood are stream-of-conscious blurts that exhibit pinhole views of his soul.
    </p>
<p>
    The opener, ""Tone Bone Kone"", is a baffler. Russell huffs alliterations while his cello ransacks a room to chase after a ringing UFO noise. The following, three-part ""Tower of Meaning - Rabbit's Ears - Home"" is a gently narcotic ballad as he hums perfectly in-tune with his tapestry-weaving chords, uttering odd lines like ""I'm watching out of my ear"" and letting his vocal tones overpower all semantics. The nine-minute trance of ""Soon to Be Innocent Fun - Let's See"" drifts through waters that mirror the moonless sky. As Russell seemingly daydreams of escape from the urban din, he shades and trickles melodies instead of fully playing them. ""Answers Me"" is an afterthought of ""Soon"" as Russell yelps in the same key, ""I'm going where the islands are going,"" while his cello shakes its head with scrapes and mumbling harmonics.
    </p>
<p>
    The same restlessness drives ""Place I Know - Kid like You"" as Russell drenches his Hendrixian riffs in hydrochloric distortion, as he also does on the backward-looped shimmering of his bluesy space-out, ""Wax the Van."" That song's textures vaguely would resemble the garage-sold Americana of Sonic Youth's <em>Sister</em> if it wasn't for some tacky synth bloops. ""Lucky Cloud"" makes better use of the synthesizer as its tweaked swiggles and bare-boned tones fittingly offset growling strings. ""Let's Go Swimming"" eschews the fidgety Miami electro-funk of the Walter Gibbons mix for a cubistic moment where reverb-polluted drones and squeals give way to flickering chords. Russell then deadpans childlike phrases like ""What country are you swimming to?"" and ""I'm banging on your door in the clear-blue sky"" into a muffled whisper. Once the groove picks up, the music ends.
    </p>
<p>
    Russell's most poignant moments are when his production's playfulness articulates his fractured thoughts better than any lyrics. On ""Tree House"", he pits his vocals in different rooms, soaking in their acoustics, as if sneaking into his tree house to play hookey. <em>World</em>'s finest moment, ""See-Through"", lets his cello's high registers criss-cross about to blanket his dazed sighs that fade into an ether like Polaroids left in the sunlight too long. It's a fitting eulogy.

But once upon a time the word indicated a more specific, codified form of verse. In the days before widespread literacy, a ballad was a dramatic (frequently tragic) story-poem that functioned as something of an oral newspaper, constructed simply with recurring rhymes so that it could be easily remembered and repeated. And on her captivating debut album, <i>Ballads of Living and Dying</i>, Marissa Nadler does her small part to return balladry to its vivid and illustrious past.</p><p>
    
    On the surface this might not sound like a compelling proposition, but fortunately Nadler has the sort of voice that you'd follow straight to Hades. Her luxurious, resonant soprano is immediately transfixing, and throughout these songs it envelops the listener like a dense fog rolling in off the moors. Nadler's vocals are highly reminiscent of Hope Sandoval's-- with perhaps the faintest glimmer of the languid phrasing of cabaret chanteuse Marlene Dietrich-- and her unadorned arrangements recall the rain-weary solitude of early Leonard Cohen met with Mazzy Star or Opal at their most hazily narcotic.</p><p>
    
    Nadler is clearly savvy enough in her material to know that a true collection of ballads must include a body count, and the most obviously successful auld school example here is her arrangement of Edgar Allen Poe's poem ""Annabelle Lee"". As you might recall from junior high English, this is a classic tale of ill-starred love with a stretched-by-your-grave finale that fits the ballad form to perfection, and Nadler's melodic rendition here is flawless. And poor Annabelle Lee is not this album's only casualty; there's also ""Virginia"", which respectfully chronicles the death of Virginia Woolf, as well as dreamier, more ambiguous songs like ""Undertaker"" and ""Box of Cedar"" which certainly contain whispers of foreboding for their subjects.</p><p>
    
    Each song on the album comes lightly-dressed, usually borne along by little more than Nadler's voice, her fingerpicked guitars, and ornamental flourishes from the occasional accordion, autoharp, or blurry wisp of feedback. On ""Hay Tantos Muertos"", one the album's loveliest tracks, Nadler branches out from the strict balladic format, quoting lines from Pablo Neruda's haunting ""No Hay Olvido"" (""There Is No Forgetting"") in a manner resembling a traditional Portuguese fado, and on ""Days of Rum"" she busts out a banjo and takes an enchanting turn at a Dock Boggs-style country blues.</p><p>
    
    It's worth noting that, aside from the Poe and Neruda quotes, all of these songs are original compositions rather than the traditional works they appear. Throughout the album Nadler writes and performs with a weathered maturity that belies her young age. In fact, several tracks (""Mayflower May"", ""Days of Rum"", ""Fifty-Five Falls"") seem to be narrated from the perspective of older women looking back upon the adventures and mistakes of their youth. Also an accomplished visual artist, Nadler's lyrics showcase a perceptive eye and a genuine empathy for her creations; and when coupled with that intoxicating voice the resulting landscape is one you may want to get lost in for a century or two.</p></div>"|5907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5907-ballads-of-living-and-dying/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

Perhaps that's either because they toss the genre's grainy trashcan beats in favor of gentler, funked-up MIDI rhythms, or because when they sing about fucking someone's brains out they make sure back it up with mundane scene-setters like, ""I'll order a chai tea and you will have the usual au lait"". Either way, Karin and Olof Dreijer have hatched an album that works where so many others fail, proving that fun needn't be spooned with irony.</p><p>
    
    Every pop duo seems to need a gag, and The Knife's is familial: The Dreijers are siblings, and <i>Deep Cuts</i> is teeming with winking incestuous undercurrents. ""I'm in love with your brother,"" sings Karin Dreijer over a popping steel drum melody on ""Pass This On"", and it's unclear if she's being addressed or what. Elsewhere, the lyrics are generally about parties and sex, dating and relationships. But, nevertheless-- topics that few sibling acts would so affably address.</p><p>
    
    The Knife don't seem to care much about how their lyrics are interpreted. Instead, they're preoccupied with cheeky and lascivious synth sounds: hollow, creeping mallet instruments (""One for You""), glowing arena glides (""You Take My Breath Away""), and spitting saw-waves that grab for echoing space (""You Make Me Like Charity""). The varieties usually don't intertwine, except on ""Heartbeats"", <i>Deep Cuts</i>' first single and by far its standout track.</p><p>
    
    Besides being densely layered and exquisitely written, a grandiose, saw-heavy track like ""Heartbeats"" is a wistful, quixotic dancefloor closer. Bands seldom make albums full of songs like these, but you almost wish the Knife did. That's because ""Heartbeats"" is so out of step with the rest of <i>Deep Cuts</i>. Lodged in the opening slot, its plasticized emotional bombast stands apart from the album's general malaise. ""You Make Me Like Charity"" is cheap, austere and vulgar; ""Heartbeats"" is warmer and brimming with existential urgency. Karin conquers her apathy and belts like a less anglophilic Madonna. The beat is thick and shifty, providing a solid foundation for the layers and layers of cascading melody. And though you might expect a track of such intensity to spoil quickly, ""Heartbeats"" has a durable shelf life.</p><p>
    
    Even though its strongest song is a head-scratching blip on the radar, <i>Deep Cuts</i> is still an impressive effort. ""She's Having a Baby"" is as misleading as it is delightfully twisted. Beneath french horn,  vacillating sustained pad swells, and Olof's languid vocals, the track's coruscating music box melody suggests something slightly and eerily askew. Elsewhere, ""Girls' Night Out"", with its whirring synth zaps and fast clicking pulse, could score the bomb detonation scene in a techie thriller if not for carpe diem salvos like, ""and we ride through the moonlight, far beyond."" If the Knife want to make merely good records, they need only to make up their mind; but let's hope they strike a balance between the quaking sentimentality of ""Heartbeats"" and the svelte realism of their other songs and start making great ones.</p></div>"|4589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4589-deep-cuts/|7.6|Sam Ubl

From the marshes of Long Island, a man-- better yet, a Rugged Man-- arises to deliver an album so drenched in self-deprecation that listeners bypass any notes of sympathy and gas themselves, if only in solidarity with R.A.'s overwhelming antipathy.  R.A. the Rugged Man hates you, but he hates himself more.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, the former Biggie collaborator has a lot to be angry about.  <i>Die Rugged Man Die</i> is the autopsy of disaster as R.A. reflects on his heartbreaks and hostilities with a familial bluntness. By the early 90s, R.A.'s future beamed with opportunity. Russell Simmons and the Neptunes courted the raucous underground star before Jive scooped him up in '93. On the brink of celebrity, everything fell apart with Rube Goldberg precision, culminating in R.A.'s release from Jive after a sexual harassment suit and a carnivalesque CMJ showcase that prominently featured saloon-style brawling, tied-up prostitutes, and a gleefully urinating Rugged Man.</p><p>
    
    Since then, R.A. has played the albatross, trekking the underground and garnering reputation as the Chupucabra of the underground. Aside from an appearance on <i>Soundbombing, Vol. 1</i>, R.A. has been an apparition, adding a celebratory import to his Nature Sounds debut. Now, the ghost finally speaks.</p><p>
    
    No one can walk away from <i>Die Rugged Man Die</i> without a clear sense of who R.A. is: The man has a gift for autobiography and he draws the listener with the familiarity of a fireside, storytelling uncle. Granted he's the uncle who takes shits on your face while you sleep. Against Nilez' dawdling guitars on ""A Star is Born"", R.A. regurgitates his griminess as a Jive Records leper: ""'They say he's a beast, he's a creature/ Keep him in the other room, don't let him see Aaliyah.""</p><p>
    
    All vulgar showmanship aside, Rugged Man addresses subjects with clarity and humor. On the album's single ""Lessons"", he deftly caricatures the myopic label execs who stifled his career as a white rapper. Rising producer Koran pushes a pre-school child's vocals over Fischer-Price keyboards as R.A. jests: ""They say maybe if you had Dr. Dre or Timbaland/They say a white boy need a black boy to win/ Bubba Sparxxx did and so did Slim/ Just Blaze is hot. Why don't you get with him?""  Concerned with the trends of hip-hop consumers, R.A. fires a simple critique on the memory-lane ballad ""On the Block"": ""Now that rich kids love [hip-hop], so fuck the poor kids now.""</p><p>
    
    As a composite, however, <i>Die Rugged Man</i> fails to rework the well-worn, preachy ""mainstream=cancer"" equation. Aside from establishing his bad luck with majors, R.A.'s complaints often pose as a subconscious bid for sympathy, which is difficult considering his implosion from self-induced calamities. Why care about R.A's tales if he unflinchingly claims on ""Dumb"" that he doesn't give a fuck about his career?</p><p>
    
    Nonetheless, the completion of <i>Die Rugged Man</i> is a triumph in itself. Hip-hop's Forrest Gump has seen almost everything and tells his story well. Let's hope things at Nature Sounds stay civil so we don't have to wait another decade for his next album.</p></div>"|6934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6934-die-rugged-man-die/|7.5|Jamin Warren

    lachrymosity of The Lucksmiths' most recent full-length,
    <em>Naturaliste</em>. But to me, that album's bittersweet tenor (abetted
    by lead vocalist Tali White's literal one) marked a deepening of
    emotional range for an Australian outfit that always had a knack for
    sunny school's-out-for-summer melodies and idyllic Kinks guitar licks
    but often seemed, well, silly. New, unhurried ballads like
    ""Sandringham Line"" were growers, but they were also grown-up, and
    <em>Naturaliste</em> ended up topping my 2003 best-of list.</p><p>
<em>Inner North</em>, White's second outing with side project The Guild
    League, is more melancholy still (some will say maudlin), but sadder
    isn't better this time, sadly enough. The first Guild League effort,
    2002's <em>Private Transport</em>, reflected the talents of a 16-member
    outfit including members of such indie-pop groups as The Fairways, The
    Aislers Set, and Sodastream, recording on both sides of the Pacific. 
    The album's playful travelogue conceit and manifold styles were in
    keeping with its far-flung creation.</p><p>
    
    The same jangly acoustic guitars, sinuous cello and brazen bursts of
    horns that enlivened <em>Private Transport</em> remain on <em>Inner
    North</em>, as do White's clear, Aussie-next-door vocals, which occupy
    a gorgeous middle ground between Morrissey and Nick Drake. But
    now the group is down to a core trio of White, guitarist Rodrigo
    Pintos-Lopez and cellist Cressida Griffiths, all Australian, and I
    can't shake the feeling they're trying too hard to make up for what
    White might call the quiet burden of their bandmates' absence. Even
    White goes overboard like a deep-sea diver, the endlessly melismatic
    ""please"" in dismal melodrama ""Time Please Gents"" marking his nadir.</p><p>
    
    It's worth remembering that The Guild League began as a vehicle for
    White's songwriting. Though he sings for The Lucksmiths, the
    compositions are rarely his (effortlessly elegiac ""What You'll Miss""
    being a notable exception). But where the best songs on <em>Private
    Transport</em>, such as ""Cornflakes"" or ""The Neatest Hand"", boast
    bouncy melodies and lyrics that find poetry in love's subtle everyday
    quirks-- ""sugar on cereal,"" ""mixtapes with careful print""-- <em>Inner
    North</em> stems from the previous record's soporific ""Dangerous
    Safety"" (dangerous for late-night drivers, heavy-machine operators and
    sleep-deprived rock writers, that is).  That little dirge marked White
    and co-writer Pintos-Lopez's first songwriting collaboration and-- oh
    frabjous day-- they've decided to write the entire new album
    together.</p><p>
    
    There's still a lot to like about <em>Inner North</em>, particularly the
    familiar Lucksmithian wordplay (""into the morning of last night"") and
    scattered instants of exuberance (""The Storm"", the strongest song on the
    album). ""Scientist"" toes the line between
    schmaltz and true romance nearly as well as <em>Private Transport</em>'s
    finest songs. ""Shot in the Arm"" has the punch of early Lucksmiths and
    the rapid-fire lyrics of The Guild League's earlier ""Siamese
    Couplets"". Even ""Animals"", ""Citronella"", and the quietly insistent,
    love-it-or-hate-it ""Trust"" provide some charming moments. But
    worshipers of White's other works would do well to take his lyric from
    ""Fingers of Sun"" as a characteristically quiet caveat: ""It's all
    coming undone."" Please, please, please don't quit your day job.</p></div>"|3660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3660-inner-north/|6.6|Marc Hogan

Someday, as the president readjusts her bra, you'll scroll past ads for Suicide Women and find out what this publication really thinks of <em>Bloodflowers</em>; let's leave it to that future-critic to evaluate the Cure as a Big Historical Entity. For the time being, let's just note what this reissue program stands to remind us of: This is a band so idiosyncratic that people hardly even noticed as they remade themselves, drastically, again and again, with an ease that'd make Bowie blush. They made minimalist punk-scene oddities and great gloomy dirges; they made synthpop of both the fey new-wave and grim New Order varieties; they made strangely day-glo pop that used bongos and horns and occasionally pretended to be jazz; they made <em>Disintegration</em>. And all that in more or less its first decade, and all of it without sounding like anything other than The Cure just being The Cure.</p><p>
    So we start with this-- a straight-up, sonically-tweaked edition of the group's 1979 UK debut album. Later editions in this series will have the luxury of filling their bonus discs with high-quality outtakes and demos; to this one falls the task of collecting all the wobbly-legged rough takes every band gathers up in its infancy. The result is mostly anthropological-- and, yes, it's difficult to imagine anyone but die-hards and vintage punk enthusiasts needing a live rendition of a song called ""Heroin Face"". But the story told by the first half of these bonuses is a fascinating one.</p><p>
    Everyone familiar with bootlegs of a skinny 18-year-old Robert Smith and a band called the Easy Cure will recognize the sound, essentially that of the punk band that wasn't. Because no matter how much they try to sound hard, no matter how classically 1977 they get (""fiery"" guitar solos!), and no matter how close they come to sounding like an Edward Gorey version of The Buzzcocks, you can hear something else bubbling up. And over the series of ""home demos"" that follows-- almost embarrassingly private ones, as if stolen from Lol Tolhurst's attic-- you can practically hear Smith realizing what that something is: He's interested in off-kilter pop songwriting, not the straight-ahead rush of punk; he's interested in slinky Roxy Music atmosphere and a dreamy, imaginary East, not gritty social realism. You might not spent hours relistening to a cheapy bedroom rough-draft of ""10:15 Saturday Night""-- or even its first-run studio demo-- but as a chance to hear a band become itself, it's remarkable.
    </p><p>
    That's particularly true when the early result is something like <em>Three Imaginary Boys</em>, as original a record as anything else to spin off from the tail end of punk. These recordings are spare and simple-- just three guys in a room playing clean, clear lines and letting them ring. And yet everything snaps together like clockwork, from the ingenious songwriting to the precise performances to the decades-long thrill of Smith's voice. This is the simplicity of punk gone suddenly complex and spooky and sneakily psychedelic, whether it's on the creeping tick-tock thrill of ""10:15 Saturday Night"" or the sneering weirdness of ""So What"", which has Smith yelping the text of a coupon offer from a bag of sugar.
    </p>
<p>
    In spots such as the effortlessly, idiosyncratically gemlike ""Fire in Cairo"" and the bouncy, apocalyptic ""Grinding Halt""-- both of which share some of the weightless charm that put ""Boys Don't Cry"" in the middle-school alternateen canon well into the 90s-- it's odd and quirky. In others, it spreads out the echo and gets slinky, trending toward later gloom. Is this what a new wave Wire might have sounded like, if they were better musicians and smoked opium and were interested in being sexy? Is this what a new wave Joy Division might have sounded like if they went for dreamy, guarded neurosis over the whole raw-passion thing? This is as bold as I'll get: Had The Cure retired after making this record, instead of complicating our appraisals with a whole ensuing career, this LP would be feted as an after-punk gem, a shinier oddball cousin to the current canon.
    </p>
<p>
    And through the second half of that bonus disc, we come to the less anthropological material that backs it up: album outtakes, rarities, live tracks, singles. The dream-pretty ""Winter"" fills out the echo and points to the future; ""World War"" might be the band's last raw sneer. We'll spare the incomparably geeky discussion that could be had about the singles, running to alternate international releases and outdated collections and recent box sets: Suffice to say that you do get ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Jumping Someone Else's Train"", the latter one of the band's snappiest, sharpest, and most natural early tunes. Listening to ""Plastic Passion"" or ""Killing an Arab"" will, for better or worse, involve purchasing other Cure product.
    </p>
<p>
    But this Cure product is a nice Cure product, no matter how little the casual fan needs basement-grotty demos or early live recordings. And it bodes well for a series of comparable packages, moving point by point through a catalog so broad and brilliant that it contains pockets and corners you can genuinely forget. Onward, then, until everyone's shocked and amazed to discover ""The Caterpillar"".

All of these translations are in one way or another appropriate descriptors for the wondrous music created by the group, which settles beautifully into an open area somewhere between the elegant minimalist orchestrations of Max Richter, the electronically-enhanced chamber music of Rachel's albums like <i>Systems/Layers</i>, and the more contemplative moments of Godspeed! You Black Emperor.</p><p>
    
    The most obvious characteristic that separates Efterklang from these other artists is their extensive use of vocals to augment their spacious orchestral sound. The band regularly alternates between male and female lead vocals, and on many tracks it also employs a full Greenlandic choir. In addition, the band's roster now includes the trumpeter Kristina Schjelde, as well as Hildur Arsaelsdottir and Edda Run Olafsdottir from Iceland's Amina string quartet, who have also performed with Sigur Ros. The cumulative weight of these collected voices and players is considerable, imbuing even the group's most fragile melodies with an astonishing degree of dramatic authority.</p><p>
    
    Each track on <i>Tripper</i> is constructed meticulously from the ground up, with a base carpeting of electronically generated beats and effects providing the connective tissue between Efterklang's frequent slow-burning crescendos. On numbers like ""Swarming"" or the exquisite ""Collecting Shields"", every element of sound is patiently introduced in sequence, allowing the listener to become familiar with each layer before subsequent waves of instrumentation arrive to crash and roil. On busier tracks, like album closer ""Chapter 6"", electronic and acoustic elements are integrated less cautiously, resulting in jarring sonic leaps that occasionally require strenuous listening but can prove enthralling if you're willing to put in the concentrative effort.</p><p>
    
    Although most lyrics I can catch seem to be sung in English, I've only been able to pick up on every third word or so, and I'm unable to say what exactly these songs are about. Efterklang's extensive and strategic use of silence, partnered with their recurrent instrumental swells and surges will surely prompt many comparisons to Sigur Ros, and at their best the group is able to fleetingly capture something of the same dream-like, nebulous yearning that has made albums like <i>Agaetis Byrjun</i> or <i>( )</i> so endlessly compelling.</p><p>
    
    Though <i>Tripper</i> was a full year in the making-- and the members of Efterklang have obviously given their full attention to even the smallest detail-- the album is not over-composed to the point of sterility. Perhaps it's a credit to the sheer number of cooks in the kitchen, but even with this music's grand scale each song is allowed enough space to be able to breathe on its own. And with their vibrant, continually evolving arrangements, Efterklang here ensures that, as their name implies, this music should continue to reverberate in your memory for a long time to come.</p></div>"|2916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2916-tripper/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

Perhaps knowing, or hoping, he'll have new listeners, he even offers an early caveat: ""My new stuff is nothing like my old stuff was, and neither one is much when compared to the show, which will not be as good as some other one you saw."" That makes any introduction I could write for him useless and redundant. Suffice it to say, Snider has released the wittiest and feistiest album of his career, one that distills the wit, melody, and bristly songwriting of his previous albums into a dozen concentrated songs bolstered by a rowdy backing band that includes long-time cohort Will Kimbrough.</p><p>
    
    As the self-assessing ""Age Like Wine"" suggests, Snider has been in the music business for so long that it's about all he knows: almost every song on <i>East Nashville Skyline</i> is about some other song or some other singer. While this might limit some artists' scope, Snider has thrived on commenting on the music industry-- it was the satirical ""Talkin' Seattle Grunge Rock Blues"" that stood out on his 1994 debut <i>Songs for the Daily Planet</i>. ""Play a Train Song""-- which is set at some beer joint, ostensibly during one of Snider's show-- presents a character sketch about ""the unofficial mayor of East Nashville,"" a hard-living guy who buys into the romance of country music: ""Play a train song,"" he shouts at the band, ""Pour me one more round/ Make 'em leave my boots on when they lay me in the ground.""</p><p>
    
    ""The Ballad of the Kingsmen"" connects the FBI's investigation of the Kingsmen's garbled ""Louie Louie"" to Marilyn Manson's numerous controversies, all of which now seem quaint. The Manson reference is a little dated, but not as much as The Kingsmen, and damned if the Columbine reference doesn't have the force of a gut punch as Snider describes the folly of blaming musicians for such atrocities. He insists he's not preaching, though, and ends the ballad by singing ""Let's Get It On""-- a pitch-perfect punchline on several levels.</p><p>
    
    As ""The Ballad of the Kingsmen"" makes clear, Snider's songs can be surprisingly complex, doubling back on themselves to deepen and complicate their meanings. ""Nashville"" purports to defend the city against its detractors, but the song rolls along on Craig Wright's Memphis boogie piano and extols the virtues of Texas country music and Bluff City piano player Jason D. Williams. But ""there ain't nothin' wrong with Nashville,"" Snider sings, ""that we can't fix in the mix."" Similarly dodgy, the timely ""Conservative Christian, Right Wing Republican, Straight, White, American Males"" (that title just sings itself) isn't just about how those extremists blame ""tree-huggin', peace-lovin', pot-smokin', porn-watchin' lazyass hippies like me"" for the country's problems. Instead, Snider's point is that both sides settle for easy answers to complex problems, finding their solution in pointless blame-placing and muckraking. And Snider has a laugh making his point.</p><p>
    
    Snider's closing cover of ""Enjoy Yourself"" seems to sum up the most valuable lesson he's learned in his long career-- and, fittingly, it's tempered with a little grim humor: ""Enjoy yourself/ It's later than you think."" Even though he's not going to die young, Snider knows he's still going to die. In the meantime, he's looking forward to all those ""cans and cans and cans of beer, and bottles of booze, and bags of pot.""</p></div>"|7797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7797-east-nashville-skyline/|8.0|Stephen M.

This is a gently inexorable record that accumulates piece by crystalline piece.</p><p>
<strong><em>1.</em></strong>  ""When it Was Ever Everything"" clearly announces the record's intent: To tenderly envelop the listener in dappling clouds of lunar light, shot through with hot, sparking wires. A recursive circuit of sparse, plucked strings, muffled chimes, and sculpted waves of bass.</p><p>
<strong><em>2.</em></strong>  With its title track, the album rejects the impossibility of voice implied by the first song's amorphous void and opens its mouth to speak. Bootsy Holler's cherubic warbles diffuse across tidal glitch-pop that makes drums sing. Attention Lali Puna: The gauntlet has been thrown.</p><p>
<strong><em>3.</em></strong>  Once an indie dude, always an indie dude. ""Drift in Place"" features guest vocals from 764-Hero's John Atkins, who sounds more like Wayne Coyne than ever, chopped up amid Scientific American's medley of dewy, pointillistic indie electronica. Sublime.</p><p>
<strong><em>4.</em></strong>  ""Victory Hold Still"" gets back to the essence of composition, abstaining from embellishment in favor of denuded elegance. The drums spit like raindrops appearing on a sidewalk. A lonesome cascade of imbricate, synthetic strings carries the melody. A pleasant confection, if less ambitious than its forerunners.</p><p>
<strong><em>5.</em></strong>  After the lulling benevolence of ""Victory Hold Still"", it's doubly galvanizing when all hell breaks loose on ""Between Urban Movements"". Over a modulating EKG tone, crisp drums fall into rigid lockstep and you feel a freestyle coming on. Instead: a sampled belligerent voice diced into infinity. Crunkness ensues.</p><p>
<strong><em>6.</em></strong>  ""Four Hour Window"" slaloms and slithers with pickup like a sonofabitch, zero to max in six seconds flat. A superlative driving-at-night song, shifting fancily around the curves as streetlights roll over the windshield. Sveltely ominous.</p><p>
<strong><em>7.</em></strong>  ""Your Utopia"" : [UNTRANSLATABLE]. The immolated ghost of Ejak's voice commits unnatural atrocities amid a flurry of trembling binary code. Post-human.</p><p>
<strong><em>8.</em></strong>  Back on Earth, it's business as usual. ""Million Lines (Slow Fade)""  spreads out in concentric rings of skittering percussion and a jostling brace of linguistically fallow syllables - all stresses, no glides. Watch for the break.</p><p>
<strong><em>9.</em></strong>  Bootsy's back, sighing and whispering through the mutated waltz of ""The Seas are the Skies"". It gets a little claustrophobic here; you might want to open a window. Unless you're worried about the sea roaring in.</p><p>
<strong><em>10.</em></strong>  ""We All are Already Are"" closes <em>Strong for the Future</em> with an unwieldy title that somewhat reflects the vague meandering within, which has satisfying moments (see the warped piano figure that comes to the fore when the beat drops out), but lacks the focus of the album's hella strong front end. Still, while <em>Strong for the Future</em>'s clarity blurs a bit in the late stage, its hermetic, lustrous atmosphere remains intact - a soundtrack for the planetarium.</p></div>"|7796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7796-strong-for-the-future/|7.4|Brian Howe

I tend to think of it as the giant crack in a massive ""Best Friends"" necklace, with the Chunnel representing the continual efforts to rejoin the Be-Fri to the st-ends. I mean, did you see the two of them at the Iran nuke negotiations?  Darling. The pretend hatred between these two is cuter than Nick and Jessica by a country mile. It was only a matter of time before the ocean-sized heartache between the French and the English manifested itself in a collaborative artistic masterpiece. Until that happens, we'll have to settle for shit like the <i>Danny the Dog</i> soundtrack.</p><p>
    
    First of all, the film, produced by Luc Besson and directed by some guy named Louis Leterrier, aka ""The Terrier"", is a martial arts rehash of <i>Le Femme Nikita</i> starring Jet Li as a man raised as a pitbull, aka a terrier. Eeeeeyeah! If you aren't totally psyched already, you can download the trailer that features Hong Kong's most exciting action star eating ice cream with an irritating teenage girl. If the soundtrack is any indication, the movie will alternate between sleep-inducing banality, weepy sentiment, and dumb stunts.</p><p>
    
    Once upon a time, around the same time actually, brown-nosed critics worldwide were lauding Besson and Massive Attack as the Second Coming in their respective fields. They were changing the direction of art on a grand commercial scale, critically praised, artistically imitated, and publicly consumed. They arguably produced two or three classics apiece, and their money men gave them carte blanche. Besson crapped out <i>The Fifth Element</i>, and Massive Attack took four years to release the outstandingly mediocre <i>100th Window</i>. Oopsy. I'm not even sure how artists fall this hard. Hopefully, it at least involves a lot of expensive drugs and high-priced whores.</p><p>
    
    Now, like two wounded nobles with hungry commoners storming the castle from all sides, Besson and Massive Attack have banded together. Unfortunately, they are slaughtered and the commoners play soccer with their heads.</p><p>
    
    Massive Attack's efforts here range from the plodding downtempo on the titular ""Danny the Dog"" to Crystal Method outtakes like ""Simple Rules"". In between, is a whole mess of leftfield horse tranquilizers. The internets tell me that the soundtrack is sequenced chronologically, exactly how it appears in the film. If that's true, 90% of the movie will be Jet Li staring out of a window onto the rainy streets of gay Paris, the reflections of the streaking raindrops serving as metaphors for his inner turmoil.</p></div>"|5136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5136-danny-the-dog-ost/|3.0|Peter Macia

England's original mods borrowed elements of continental style and danced to western music from black America and Jamaica, filtering it all into something uniquely English. ""Mod"" is, of course, short for modern, but since the first Weller/<em>Quadrophenia</em>-inspired revival of its fashion and music, this has been chiefly forgotten. Not so by Saint Etienne, who-- although they've probably been to a few all-night soul stompers in Italian boots-- have pulled up the kickstand on their lambrettas and rode open-eyed and eared through the past 40 years of music history, making stops in Rio, Paris, Wigan, Kingston, Ibiza, Munich, New York, SoCal, Detroit, and Stockholm along the way. Over the past 15 years, Saint Etienne's music has been the result of the marriage of the best mod traditions of style and sophistication with a restless engagement with the world's best pop sounds. Their albums are like the contents of giant trunks adorned with the stickers from all the places they've visited, unpacked and arranged seamlessly alongside charity shop-purchased souvenirs of London circa 1966 and memories of the city circa 1988.</p><p>As a result, Saint Etienne have managed to make a career out of the mixing and matching of everything in the past 40 years of rock history except, well, rock'n'roll itself. Their music is a blend of girl group, Motown, Northern soul, disco, yè-yè and other French pop, soft pop/bubblegum, acid house, and Europop, with a few spots left on the dance card for techno, dub, hip-hop, bossanova, and tropicalia. They've also managed to somehow both inhabit and reflect a very familiar, ordinary world and yet somehow make it seem exotic. Cafès, clubs, dialogue from films, the detritus of failed relationships, the bonds shared by lifelong friends: It's everything your life is made up of except everyone they know is younger and better-looking and dressed more sharply than everyone you know, and yet they're still approachable and friendly enough to invite you round their house for vodka and lemonade and play you the b-side on the Frank Wilson or Skatalites or Walker Brothers 45 they found in Spitalfields market last week.</p><p>What in the hands of many bands can seem like gravedigging or posturing is with Saint Etienne rather singular, and it's no surprise that this slightly conceptual pop band has attracted such a rabid following. And yet Sub Pop's new single-disc compilation, <em>Travel Edition, 1990-2005</em>, isn't for those fans; it's for the people who've avoided Saint Etienne, a task that should have been difficult but, depressingly, has been exceedingly easy. A pop band first and foremost, Saint Etienne are perhaps the blueprint for today's fluxpop-- artists with ultimately pop sensibilites who reach the fringe of success but never crossed over and became mainstream stars (a group that today includes everyone from Annie to Fox n' Wolf to M.I.A.). In the early 90s, Saint Etienne had their share of UK top 40 singles but no honest-to-goodness hits. They butted heads against grunge, in the process kick-starting britpop, and then-- once that devolved into guitars-only, 60s worship-- butted heads against it and the laddism that enveloped it, as well. Being slightly out of step may have allowed them the freedom to do what they wanted but it didn't afford them the popularity enjoyed by most of their contemporaries.</p>
<p><em>Travel Edition</em> does a succinct and frankly fair job of cutting through a career that is difficult for newcomers to approach. With no consensus go-to Saint Etienne album, and a catalog made of distinct and unique parts, it's difficult to drop in on any single moment and feel satisfied that you've gotten the full picture. Personally, my favorite Saint Etienne LP is the difficult-to-find German version of one of their more overlooked records, <em>Tiger Bay</em>. Ask around and you'll be just as likely to hear that-- save the slight stumble of <em>The Sound of Water</em>-- any of their studio records is their career peak. Even more confusingly, they have a number of brilliant tracks hidden away on soundtracks, rarities comps, and fan club-only releases.</p>
<p><em>Travel Edition</em> is surprisingly the group's first U.S. career-spanning compilation and-- although a pale comparison to the now-OOP 1990-95 singles comp <em>Too Young to Die</em> or the two-disc 90s comp <em>Smash the System</em>-- it's still a nicely chosen primer. <em>StS</em> is still easily available, but with the exchange rate the way it is, Sub Pop's abridged edition is a welcome option for could-be U.S. fans. Its first half is all highs, sullied only by the continually baffling decision not to include Britpop blueprint ""London Belongs to Me"" on any Saint Etienne comps and the omission of ""You're in a Bad Way"". The latter is seemingly replaced by its de facto, bouncing-around-London companion piece, <em>So Tough</em> album track ""Mario's Cafè"". All inside jokes and sunny optimism, ""Mario's Cafè"" describes London as a place of lazy pleasures like morning coffee, the <em>Racing Post</em>, the KLF on TV, and the quirks, hopes, and desires of close friends. ""Everyone's dreaming of all they have to live for/ Joking around/ Still digging that sound,"" singer Sarah Cracknell coos. Sometimes losing yourself in London isn't such a bad thing.</p>
<p>The rest of the first first half of the disc is sublime: The acid-tinged cover of ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"", the single edit of ""Avenue"", and the tear-stained ballads ""Hobart Paving"" and ""Like a Motorway"" are all nearly flawless. The second half is a little heavy on tracks from Saint Etienne's prescient Swedish pop-tinged <em>Good Humour</em>-- no surprise, considering it was their only full-length studio record to come out on Sub Pop. It also includes the oft-overlooked ""Burnt Out Car"", the two best tracks from the underwhelming <em>Sound of Water</em>, and a pair from the return-to-form <em>Finisterre</em>.</p>
<p>The tugs here for longtime fans are the short, early-90s instrumental that acts as the set's overture and a new song which serves as a taster for the band's early 2005 release. Both are excellent. The instrumental, ""Primrose Hill"", is a charming little acoustic strum that hints at the melody to <em>Finisterre</em>'s ""Soft Like Me""; the full new track, ""Fascination"", is a continuation of that record's buzzing, whirling melodies and another of Cracknell's wise, detached urban-relationship narratives.</p>
<p>The album closes with the title track to <em>Finisterre</em>, which reads like the band's manifesto, almost every line a slogan and a hint at why and how they've become such unifying figures over the past 15 years. The song's title refers to Land's End, the place on the English coast in which the world supposedly ends. When paired with claims that ""I like the feeling of being slightly lost/ To find new places"", ""There are too many bands that at length sound tame"", ""So bored with...the myth of common sense"", and ""I believe in love over cynicism"", as well as Cracknell's chorus call, ""Finisterre/ To tear it down/ And start again"", the song neatly encapsulates the band's longtime realization that pop music's traditional timeline and oft-told tales have reached that mythical land's end; that the well-traveled road that led from from Elvis to the Beatles to punk to Nirvana has run into a dead end, and it's time to go back and traverse some of the more overgrown paths, to tell the stories that have been consigned to footnotes in pop's back pages, to start again. If you've not travelled those roads, this is a good a place to begin as any.</p></div>"|6975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6975-travel-edition-1990-2004/|9.0|Scott Plagenhoef

At times a leopard-printed turn-around-bright-eyes Bonnie Tyler, her vocalizations dip occasionally into the powder keg of squawky Long Island secretaries but just as often she laces her shuffle with Ann Magnuson, Kylie Minogue, and that <i>other</i> single-named downtown personality and launches into the ether around that great sparkling ball in the sky. Luckily for fans of dance-floor drama and those into the idea of a Cristina comeback, the folks at ZE have reissued her entire output, which includes 1980s sprawling, ultra percussive <i>Doll in the Box</i> and its darker 1984 synth follow-up, <i>Sleep It Off</i>.</p>
<p>Self-titled when it was originally released, <i>Doll In the Box</i> was produced by August Darnell aka Kid Creole. The humid ""Jungle Love"" arrangements are clearly his, but the frenetic Latin beats work well with her sensibilities. Obviously intended for the dancefloor, only a 21-second bit of incidental noise dips below four minutes and the majority of the tracks are well above five. For example, ""Don't Be Greedy""'s handclaps and taunting group whines contrast with the smooth vibes, horn section, and Cristina's pouty ruminations that ""every time I mention sex you turn away and say you're out of breath,"" etc. The jazzy percussion's reminiscent of Liquid Liquid: snaps, shakers, cowbell, and maracas.</p>
<p>Cristina's especially fun when she vamps: ""Temporarily Yours"", an up-tempo couples-only roller-rink spin cycle finds her asking not to be labeled a whore briefly before she makes like Veruca Salt lusting for that golden goose, breathily demanding ""Give it to me/ Give it to me/ I want it now"" over handclaps, flute, and a woozy string section. She emerges in salsa mode for ""Blame It On Disco"", lamenting the absence of her man, who she fears is dancing his life away. A taut bass and junkyard bongo army tear it down halfway through; later, she moans wantonly over a telephone synth, squeaker toys, and a heady Latin choir.</p>
<p>The original album is buttressed with five strong bonus tracks. Besides two versions of her Betty Boop cover of The Beatles ""Drive My Car,"" the creme de la creme offering is the half-spoken cabaret of ""Is That All There Is?"" which focuses on Cristina's father burning down her childhood house and her hard-ass response: ""Is that all there is to a fire?"" The track resembles David Tibet and Gogol Bordello doing the Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack: ""If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep dancing/ Let's break out the booze and have a ball."" As with many of her compositions, she squeals about the NYC club scene of the time of ""bored bankers dancing with beautiful models"" and ""beautiful boys with dyed hair dancing with each other."" Then, of course, she falls in love with the ""most wonderful boy in Manhattan"": ""He'd beat me black and blue and I loved it."" The final coda mixes in a cuckoo clock and broken glass, people talking and laughing panning between speakers, a popped cork, a balloon.</p>
<p>Proving this gem wasn't an anomaly, Cristina throwns down plenty of magic on her sophomore release, <i>Sleep It Off</i>. Adorned with a fabulous Jean-Paul Goude photograph of a long-necked Cristina swan as musical staff, the album was produced by Don Was and includes a contribution from James Chance and covers of Van Morrison's ""Blue Money"" and the 1980 country hit ""She Can't Say That Anymore"".  Perhaps mirroring the times (the bohemia promise of 1980, the gentrification of 1984) this is a darker album all in all. The subject matter is especially downtown edgy, as if she was dipping into Kathy Acker and Lydia Lunch when she sat down to pen her libretto.  Opting for shorter/tighter shorter songs (none reaching five minutes)     and more hooks, Cristina sounds especially alive while also     bringing to mind a patchwork-punk Debbie Harry with an ultra cool Euro     backing band.</p>
<p>""He Dines Out On Death"" presents a suicidal woman with a fistful of pills in a foreign hotel. In the creaky ""What's A Girl To Do"" she sings, ""My life is in a turmoil/ My thighs are black and blue/ My sheets are stained so is my brain/ What's a girl to do?"" All this amid an off-kilter, squawky synthesizer coupled with very tinny toy piano break-up, and slithering distortion. She also offers her first of many Johnny Rotten snarls. (Also check out the Julie-Ruin styling of ""Don't Mutilate My Mink"".)</p>
<p>It's on the bonus tracks that she especially shines. ""Smile"" is a Blondie-infused triumph. There are two takes on the ""Deb Behind Bars,"" more stiletto-punk cabaret. ""Things Fall Apart"" transforms a music box into fuzzed death disco w/ electric guitars. Best of all, her chirpy, whiplash cover of Prince's ""When You Were Mine"" (rendered here as ""When You Are Mine"") is an indispensable tablespoon of synth-pop sugar.</p>
<p>While these albums are obviously old-school crackly, they don't feel dated or nostalgic. And though the time's past, perhaps a pair of reissues will     give at least a glimpse of how complex and fun popular culture could've been if Harvard girl Cristina's intelligent kitsch had lodged itself in the popular conscious instead of the new-age     pabulum of a desperately seeking diva with a goddess complex.</p></div>"|11707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11707-doll-in-the-box-sleep-it-off/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

It's a little startling hearing the man who barked and onomatopoeia'ed songs like ""Casiotone Nation"" and ""Uh Zoom Zip"" now singing on <i>Skittish</i>, his first solo album, which was recorded in 1996, released with extremely minimal packaging through his web site in 1999, and finally re-released with the follow-up <i>Rockity Roll</i> by ATO Records this year.</p><p>
    
    But Doughty's soft-rock proclivities shouldn't especially surprise anyone: <i>Ruby Vroom</i> ended with the gentle ""Janine"", a duet with his answering machine that informs almost everything on <i>Skittish</i>. What is really curious, however, is hearing Doughty's reedy voice sound so much deeper and grainier; stripped of his jolting irony, he sounds not just sincere, but genuinely wounded and much older, even though the album was recorded almost eight years ago.</p><p>
    
    And there are others reasons this acoustic context is a little confounding: over three albums Soul Coughing worked a chaotic sampling aesthetic that played Doughty's half-spoken, half-scatted observations against a frenetic backdrop of funky drums, jazz bass, and Mark de Gli Antoni's samples, which sounded like another instrument altogether.</p><p>
    
    By contrast, <i>Skittish</i>-- minimally produced by Kramer-- is mostly Doughty playing acoustic guitar and singing more traditional songs that he claims the other members of Soul Coughing refused to entertain. On the whole, they are love songs and they convey edgier, more complex emotions than he was able to express with his former band. <i>Skittish</i> begins with ""The Only Answer"", about meeting a new lover and all the excitement that comes with a new relationship. Doughty reveals his hopefulness in his snappy cover of Mary J. Blige's ""Real Love"" and expresses reservations in ""Shunned + Falsified"". The progression from track 1 to track 12 has the arc of a narrative, which makes ""Rising Sign"", the final track, all the more powerful, especially when Doughty sings ""I resent the way you make me like myself."" That statement sounds especially hard-won, and <i>Skittish</i> possesses the organic perfection of an album that needed desperately to be made, as if Doughty couldn't keep the songs inside anymore. They burble out freely and fully, and despite the minor flourishes of orchestra and organ on ""No Peace, Los Angeles"" and the bass rhythms on ""Looks,"" the overall effect remains elemental, unadorned, solitary.</p><p>
    
    It's an aesthetic that he could not-- and apparently had no desire to-- maintain. Released through his web site in 2003, <i>Rockity Roll</i> dresses up similar, but lesser, songs in dinky keyboards and drum machines, and yet, for everything he adds, this mini-album seems to lose something. It sounds neither as immediate nor as fascinating as its predecessor, which is a comparative criticism but still reflects on <i>Rockity Roll</i> itself. To an extent, these six songs live and die with Pat Dillett's crisp, but often textureless, production: ""Ways + Means"" employs the same bouncy rhythms as ""Circles"" from Soul Coughing's slick swan song <i>El Oso</i>, and ""27 Jennifers"" sounds merely clever, its romantic sentiment lost among the drums and keyboards. But ""Down on the River by the Sugar Plant"" resonates with its frosty, noir-ish atmosphere and Doughty's precisely evocative lyrics about street merchants and heavy earrings, and ""40 Grand in the Hole"" offers an affecting-- and somewhat uncomfortable-- assessment of Doughty's financial, creative, and drug problems.</p><p>
    
    To tempt diehard fans who purchased both albums directly from Doughty's web site or merchandise table-- and who very likely bought the live disk he's selling now-- ATO has appended five bonus tracks to <i>Rockity Roll</i>. The two live cuts were culled from his Bonnaroo appearance, but neither adds much to its original. The studio version of ""Move On"", from <i>The Future Soundtrack of America</i> compilation, was one of that collection's and this year's best and most measured protest songs, if only for professing simultaneous love for and exasperation with America. But this stage version loses the walking rhythm that made the original sound so neighborly, as if Doughty had written and recorded it while strolling through the boroughs. And that seems to be the key to Doughty's charms as a solo musician: as these two releases make clear, he is at his best when he's at his most unassuming, when it sounds like he just picked up his guitar and sang whatever came to mind.</p></div>"|11724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11724-skittishrockity-roll/|7.5|Stephen M.

While there may be no shortage of high cheek-boned talent leeches in town, I've yet to hear any firsthand accounts of a 66-year-old Bavarian cadaver wandering about. This, I'm sure, will be good news to Gena Olivier's parents as I'm sure she's been telling them for years that she, in fact, is the lead singer of Midnight Movies.</p><p>
    
    While Olivier's ghostly baritone does occasionally hint at the Chelsea Girl's narco-drone-- especially when she drops tone at the end of a line-- she pairs the gloom with a winsome lilt that indicates actual emotion, all while pounding away on her drum kit. The easy comparisons are the nagging wench for Midnight Movies, though, and they don't stop with the singer. Guitarist Larry Schemel and keyboardist Jason Hammons blend the sprawl of Trail of Dead and Clinic's thundering hum with Stereolab's electronic flourishes, blanketing the album in a foreboding amber-tinted haze. At times though, having such contemporary influences arrests the record's momentum, particularly when they are not hidden all that well-- ""Just To Play"" damn near samples the intro to Walking With Thee's ""Harmony"".</p><p>
    
    The band's saving grace is its commitment to and execution of its textural aesthetic, owing as much to David Lynch's oneiric odes to Los Angeles as any musical counterpart. Midnight Movies shoots for a fevered dream in which the broad day's shadows and the night beyond the headlights are equally ominous, and more often than not, it succeeds. Schemel and Hammons' melodies lurk and lunge where necessary, and Olivier taps out the telltale heartbeat. Olivier's lyrics frequently resemble the diary of an apparition doomed to haunt the bearded and black-rimmed corners of neighborhood dives. On ""Human Mind Trap"" she mourns, ""Pondering inside her grave/hopeless knowing there's no end/she cries and cries"". Elsewhere, she sounds like the crazy girl who slipped pages of Gorey into your locker scribbled with poetry, most preciously on ""Words For A Love Song"", literally a laundry list of apt vocab. And here's where the Nico comparison is relevant because it is Olivier's voice as instrument that is most compelling, much in the same way that Reed, Dylan, and Cale manipulated the German ice queen's voice to reflect the intention of their compositions.</p><p>
    
    If Midnight Movies sucked you'd have read a list of influences like Lauper, Yankovic and Har Mar instead of what's above. Some bands are lucky enough to get paid to find their sound. Some never find it. If Midnight Movies don't allow hype to flop their buttocks over their ears, they should be just fine.</p></div>"|5624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5624-midnight-movies/|7.2|Peter Macia

He cut his funk 45s with Kraftwerk and helped to found the conscious, Afrocentric Zulu Nation movement, which briefly rose to prominence in the rap world in the late 80s and early 90s. As Afrika Bambaataa, he changed music forever in the space of just two 1982 singles, the sublime slices of electro-rap ""Planet Rock"" and ""Looking for the Perfect Beat"". So, given his hip-hop deity status, you'll forgive me for cutting him some slack as he continues his quest for the perfect beat at age 44.</p><p>
    
    By the sound of things, Bambaataa is influenced today by all of the things his early records influenced-- big beat, house, electro, hip hop. It's funny to hear the updated beats and tougher low-end of the 00s paired with the stiff cadence of ultra-old-school rap; the way it's so unabashedly corny is an anachronism, but an entertaining one. A casual survey of the lyrics reveals that the most commonly uttered words by Bambaataa's latest Zulu Nation crew are ""Afrika"" and ""Bambaataa,"" followed closely by ""Zulu Nation,"" but it's impossible to call it boastful-- they just seem to be celebrating their ability to make funky dance music and have a good time.</p><p>
    
    And it is a good time, uptempo and stuffed with spiky synth, the occasional scratch, catchy chant, and-- of course-- a parade of thumping, charismatic beats. ""Got That Vibe"" opens the album with a wicked sitar sample and a killer rhythm track and they're off, complete with covers of Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango's amazing 1972 club hit ""Soul Makossa"" and Gary Numan's ""Metal"". Numan even shows up to sing on ""Metal"", sounding like he has about 80 marbles in his mouth. ""2137"" and ""Almighty Rah"" show shades of ""Planet Rock"" with their tossed salad of bright beats and dark keyboards and it's on those songs that the reverb reaches Lee Perry levels, with MCs and soul samples echoing like crazy.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, when they could have stopped it at 12 tracks and had a pretty good party on their hands (provided they switched out the awful, overly repetitive ""Pick Up on This"" with the wild dancefloor rave-up ""Meet Me at the Party""), they kept right on going, and it stops being fun after a certain point-- especially when songs like ""Electro Salsa"" don't develop at all. At any rate, I never expected a masterpiece from Bambaataa at this stage of the game, and <i>Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light</i> is, as one might reasonably expect, not a masterpiece. It's also not essential listening-- Tommy Boy's <i>Looking for the Perfect Beat</i> comp is probably all the Bambaataa most people will ever need-- but it sure is fun.</p></div>"|1143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1143-dark-matter-moving-at-the-speed-of-light/|6.9|Joe Tangari

This is not so surprising from the man who fronted both Space Needle and Varnaline-- the former was a spacey rock trio with psychedelic leanings, the latter an earthier counterpart that emphasized alt-country-oriented songs. <i>Tell It to the Dust</i> (which is possibly named for John Fante's Depression-era novel <i>Ask the Dust</i>) follows Varnaline's final bow, 2001's <i>Songs in a Northern Key</i>, and mixes elements of both bands-- especially in the songs that bookend the album.</p><p>
    
    The record opens with its title track, which features the LP's loveliest melody and catchiest chorus-- both of which are sung in service to lyrics that communicate sober resignation: ""I know it's dust to dust/ I know it all will fade/ I know it's built to rust/ and that it all will change."" But the track's straightforward accompaniment turns a corner on the coda, as Parker's guitar wrings the drama out of his everyday observations. What began as personal becomes something immense and ascendant. Its counterpart, the closing ""Doornail (Hat's Off to Buster Keaton)"", works a murky blues riff into a nearly eight-minute jam, but remains grounded and mired in the mud, creating a very different kind of drama as Parker sings about how ""time won't change a thing."" Both songs inhabit the same emotional space, but the musical terrain is strikingly different.</p><p>
    
    The 10 songs between ""Tell It to the Dust"" and ""Doornail"" don't reach the heights of those two, but they do reflect the tension between Parker's restlessness and his need for strictly defined musical structures. Parker lets various instruments define different songs, which not only lends each track its own distinctive personality, but also gives the whole an added dynamic. ""Feel the Same"" fades out on a George Harrison guitar line, and ""Into the Sun"" rides a ponderous guitars riff that threatens psychedelia.</p><p>
    
    Kendall Meade's piano and Joan Wasser's violin make ""Innocents"" sound even more fragile, and kudos to Parker for using the words ""sunbeam"" and ""moonbeam"" unironically. If any song on <i>Tell It to the Dust</i> could have fallen flat, it's this one, which is a warble away from Counting Crows/Five for Fighting schmaltz. Yet in the context of these hard-luck songs (especially followed by the reassurances of ""Don't Worry Honey, Everything's Gonna Be Alright""), it succeeds as a tender ode to childhood and a lament over the hardships of adulthood.</p><p>
    
    Despite his warring urges for both making and breaking form, Parker doesn't reinvent or even update the nearly dormant alt-country genre, but he does gently nudge it: <i>Tell It to the Dust</i> tweaks his sound just enough to make it sound not ambitious or innovative, but deeply personal, like something only he-- and not Space Needle, Varnaline, or anyone else-- could have recorded.</p></div>"|6559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6559-tell-it-to-the-dust/|7.7|Stephen M.

    Volume alone doesn't make for great rock music, and A Cricket in Times Square take a risk on their debut album by ditching precision and almost rendering themselves faceless. They hit the usual reference points-- from the guitar jams of a ""Sister Ray"" to the massive shoegaze of Bailter Space-- so the trick is to set themselves apart from their forebearers. Frontman Michael Tyler often drowns his vocals by shouting into the winds, rendering himself almost anonymous. You can hear his space-weary voice more clearly on the slow numbers. He gets an extended showcase on ""Outliving Your Shadow"", a drowsy slow dance on which he sounds like he's drooling on his pillow; the last half of the song jerks awake with an extended guitar solo that wails and doubles up on itself.</p><p> 
    
    But even as the guitars try to crush the album, the band's songwriting triumphs. Each track is a distinct composition, from the climbing riffs of ""Careless"" or the ominous two-note figure that repeats through ""5 1/2-Minute Hallway"", chased by eerie leather-winged-bird noises that recall early Pink Floyd. In the quiet-to-loud Galaxie 500 dreaminess of ""Mourning Son"", the chorus hangs on like a battleship in high seas while the band struggles to bash it off course, and the frenetic melody of ""Everything Known About Medicines"" hits the highest energy mark, setting off eruptions at every chorus.</p><p>
    
    Other effects-heavy guitar bands may be more psychedelic, outro or spastic, but by taking a straighter approach to their wall of sound they play to their strength: the gigantic melodies. The band's pedal fetish doesn't get in the way of songwriting, and each wash of noise yields a memorable tune. It's not clear why they named themselves after a children's book, except that the image of a cricket chirping in the middle of skyscrapers matches the way they sound like they're shouting into a vast expanse. In spite of the static, their message hits the mark.</p></div>"|1785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1785-a-cricket-in-times-square/|7.6|Chris Dahlen

As often happens with electronic producers, the records he releases under his own name tend to showcase his more ""serious"" academic side, jettisoning beats in favor of studied digital soundscapes. As with <i>Piercing Music</i> (1994) and <i>Floating.Point</i> (1997), <i>Signal to Noise</i> comes from Henke's own Imbalance Computer Music imprint, which is now distributed by Kompakt.</p><p>
    
    One of Henke's enduring fascinations is completely digital composition that remains connected to the sounds of nature, and the three tracks on <i>Signal to Noise</i> continue his experiments in this vein. In Henke's sleeve notes, which perhaps give too much away (admitting that his ""recordings mainly consisted of harmonic droning, so I found them to be a bit boring after extensive listening""), he details his working method, which involved pitch shifting and filtering drones from the Yamaha SY77 synthesizer. The neo-moonscape photograph on the cover from Joshua Tree National Park is an appropriate visual analog to these dry and dusty tracks.</p><p>
    
    ""Signal to Noise I"" is 20-plus minutes of morphing static, with an extended chord or two that also undergo gradual filtering. While much drone music gets mileage out of slow changes that exist in the threshold of perception, Henke's filter sweeps are explicit and obvious, such that you can almost see his hands slowing turning the nobs. ""Signal to Noise II"" is more standard ambient territory, with a simple series of held tones, while ""Studies for Thunder"" sews rolling booms, explosive crackles, and cyborg cricket chirps into the digital wind.</p><p>
    
    Henke's prized Yamaha dates from 1990, but his favored textures seem much older. It all sounds a bit like an early synthesizer artifact circa Wendy Carlos' 1972 record <i>Sonic Seasonings</i>, illustrating how filtered white noise assumes the character of wind and rain with the proper tweaks applied. It's completely devoid of drama (quite intentionally, I'm sure), and instead seems to exist to facilitate some sort of meditative state. Too often, though, Henke makes the easy choices, and the predictability of these sounscapes keeps the listener from full immersion. The uninspired title was the first clue that this was one to pass on.</p></div>"|3998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3998-signal-to-noise/|4.8|Mark Richardson

But this isn't your ordinary MBV knock-off; the London-based duo fall into a glitchier category, fitting naturally and notably alongside bands like Lali Puna, Ms. John Soda, and a less sentimental Postal Service.</p><p>
    While many recent albums in its vein have thrived on maudlin excess (The Postal Service's <i>Give Up</i>, Notwist's <i>Neon Golden</i>) or facile Portishead impersonations (Beth Orton's <i>Daybreaker</i>), <i>Tiger, My Friend</i> is much frillier. Psapp tread lightly, exploring instrumentation and rhythm with a touching, childlike curiosity. Their songs don't bear much weight, musically or lyrically, and that's part of what makes them so appealing.</p><p>
    Psapp knock out intricate songs in odd meters with impressive dexterity. Frail strings, trebly pianos, and glockenspiels mingle quietly and expressively beneath Durant's breathy vocals. It's difficult enough to arrange such fickle instruments in straight time, but Psapp tackle daunting rhythmic blueprints without flinching. Most of the time it works. ""Chapter"" and the title track feature cascading polyrhythmic melodies while ""Rear Moth"" stomps out a jaunty 5/4.</p><p>
    Of course, with music this purposefully airy, Psapp suffer from a certain amount of preciousness. But even <i>Tiger, My Friend</i>'s most saccharine numbers are delivered cautiously. ""Curuncula""-- with its wistful guitar loop, click-clack beat, and faint sustained organ-- strikes the best balance: Durant levels the song's rhythmic pep with her demure vocal delivery and a chorus of, ""We have only ourselves/ Only ourselves to blame.""</p><p>
    Though Psapp are sure to draw comparisons to Múm for their use of music box and glockenspiel, the songs on which the twinkling instruments feature most prominently are actually the album's darkest. ""Calm Down"" has a chilly opening hook and whooshing, glacial background textures. The following track, ""Velvet Pong"", with similar instrumentation and an almost identical melody, is sequenced perfectly; Durant stands out during the song's chorus, singing in a hazy, coquettish croon that recalls Cocorosie's Cassidy sisters.</p><p>
<i>Tiger, My Friend</i> is surprisingly coherent for a debut album. Compared to Ben Gibbard's in-your-face emotionality or Ms. John Soda's blissed-out urbanity, Psapp are refreshingly restrained, and the result is greater consistency. Sure, greater dynamic variety and some selective risktaking would be nice, but these precocious upstarts already got the tough part pinned down: subtlety. Psapp have laid themselves a remarkably self-assured template for subsequent outings.</p></div>"|6558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6558-tiger-my-friend/|7.5|Sam Ubl

    HAMTA\xCF!! Allëhlüïa! Allëhlüïa! Allëhlüïa!</p><p>
    Dear, dear earthlings. You never realized what awaited you from beyond the skies. You lived here, with your war and death, and wouldn't take good advice from a higher species. Worst of all, you have imprisoned the innocent ambassadors from the planet Kobaïa, who only came to teach you their peaceful, technologically advanced ways. Why did you do this? Didn't you realize that the Kobaïans would send help, in the form of the Ultimate Weapon? Of course, you had let the Kobaïans go, and were it not for the one guy on your planet with any sense-- the prophet Nebehr Gudahtt-- you would've surely failed to grasp the Kobaïan creed of self purification and communication with the Supreme Being. I mean, that's the reason you entered the Time of Hatred (<i>Theusz Hamtaahk</i>) and that whole Dead Earth (<i>Wurdah Itah</i>) thing. Come on, even you, adolescent beings of the universe, can understand that.</p><p>
    Well, for the few of you still unaware, there is Magma. Magma-- don't worry, they're not aliens, just French-- play ""zeuhl"" (pronounced ""tsoil""), which means ""heavenly music"" in the Kobaïan language, and lucky for you, detail the whole shabang. Led by drummer/vocalist Christian Vander, Magma began playing this stuff in the late 60s, and throughout the 70s produced a series of records that are either some of the most bizarre, fiery prog ever, or just instant party killers. First of all, they sing everything in Kobaïan, which means ix-nay on the araoke-kay; second of all, zeuhl sounds like, well, about what you'd expect an alien rock opera to sound like: massed, chanted choral motifs, martial, repetitive percussion, sudden bursts of explosive improv and just as unexpected lapses into eerie, minimalist trance-rock. Vander actually came from a jazz background, and is a major Coltrane fanatic, so it's not hard to see why he'd be so into intense, spiritu-cosmic concerns. But even still, Magma are pretty out of left field.</p><p>
<i>K.A</i> is a nugget of wisdom revived from a different era. During the early 70s, in between such classic works as <i>Mekanik Destruktïw Kommandöh</i> and <i>Köhntarkösz</i>, Vander composed a piece entitled ""Kohntark Anteria"" that he never got a chance to record. Parts of it showed up in later albums, but like Brian Wilson's <i>Smile</i>, it lay dormant until the time was right. And that time, young pilgrims of love, is now. Believers will be delighted to know that the band's first studio album in twenty years retains all of their power; <i>K.A</i> features everything we already love about Magma and then some. Newcomers: now is your time to jump onboard the train. As Zebëhn Straïn De Geustaah might say, ""Kobaïa Is de Hundin."" Würd.</p><p>
    Of course, it's not actually required that you follow the interplanetary libretto to dig Magma, which becomes very good news over the course of <i>K.A</i> three epic-length tracks. Titled simply ""I"", ""II"", and ""III"", they're joined together to form a single, monolithic slab of sound that really only has parallel in modern-day zeuhl disciples Ruins (whose self-invented language suspiciously resembles Vander's Kobaïan), and by proxy, the so-called brutal prog bands (Flying Luttenbachers, Hella, Orthrelm, Cheval de Frise, et al.). However, Magma are much less brutal, opting for more subtle, jazz-inflected dynamics: the churning, spiraling patterns of vocals, keyboards and drums in the last movement, the impressionistic choral harmonies in the second and fluid counterpoint of the opening section. Magma are often compared to really old-schoolers like Richard Wagner and Igor Stravinsky because of their aggressive, often dissonant performances of deceptively complex music. Vander's melodies seem simple-- modal and repetitive-- but the lines weave in and around each other in a dizzying fashion.</p><p>
    What's more, no matter how often they threaten to resolve into something calm and final, Magma are restless and hyper to a fault. The final movement moves through over twenty minutes of propulsive, whiplash drumming, lengthy (and, frankly, a bit meandering) soloing, and even relatively straightforward choral melodicism, so that when it arrives at its climax of a hundred proclamations of ""hallelujah!"" (or ""allëhlüïa!""), I'm just about out of breath. Vander pushes the band harder and harder, and they ride out the last four minutes of the piece in continuous, orgasmic frenzy. In fact, another core aspect of Magma's sound is their almost religious-experience intensity. (Some people actually accused them of promoting fascism in the 70s, such was the unified, juggernaut front they presented in concert.) <i>K.A</i> is a monster, and as good an intro to this band as any. I'm only too happy to spread the gospel.</p></div>"|5623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5623-ka/|8.4|Dominique Leone

UK garage has fallen into disrepair, as has two-step (or were they the same thing?). Your own middle-American town is already clogged with more British Invasion revival bands and post-punk facsimiles than you know what to do with. You're still not exactly clear on what ""grime"" is.</p><p>
    
    But you know you like The Streets. You're feeling Dizzee Rascal. Alas, you've played the available quartet of Dizzee and Streets LPs to the point of depletion. There's tons of Brithop to be found by filesharing, but if you're the old-fashioned sort who prefers label sanctioned releases, the pickings on this side of the Atlantic are slim. Roots Manuva? Fine, but you're looking for some next shit. You feel a profound empathy for fans of Argentine literature, ""all three books of it,"" as Guy Davenport caustically remarked in a recent <em>Harper's</em> article. You sink into a slough of despair.</p><p>
    
    But then you stumble across <em>Bush Meat</em> by Infinite Livez. You can tell by the cover-- a bunch of <em>Space Invaders</em>-ish creatures menacing a sweating, Cyclopean hand puppet-- that something funny is going on. Since about a fourth of the track names include ""feat. so-and-so"", you glean that it's a hip-hop record. What's more, there are certain indications-- song titles like ""UKKrap"", a <em>sans</em>-full-stop ""Mrs"" (you've read <em>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</em>, natch)-- that maybe it's a British hip-hop record. And it is!</p><p>
    
    Infinite Livez is Bethnal Green-based MC Steven Henry, a member of the Shadowless Crew, and his alter ego...or collaborator...or publicity stunt...or <em>whatever</em>, Barry Convex, the aforementioned one-eyed puppet. Henry's style recalls London expatriate Slick Rick with its vibrant, merrily obscene storytelling and velvety flow. On ""The Adventures of the Lactating Man"", a first-person narrator laments his newfound freakhood. It's leavened with clever wordplay-- eventually, the lactating man floods the streets of London, ""Everybody staying afloat in boats, 'cause I made it rise with breast milk, way (past your eyes / pasteurize)""-- and plenty of lurid trickling sounds.</p><p>
    
    Or check out ""Pononee Girl"", which seems to be a pretty straightforward account of picking up a My Little Pony in a bar. The seduction hilariously unfolds over a bombastic bass track laced with suggestive whinnies. Over dense, bouncy beats that teem with cartoon and video game sound effects, Henry's rhymes are cadenced and musical, and will be more palatable than Mike Skinner's to those of you who dig the accent, but can't countenance his stilted anti-flow. Henry exhibits a broad range and natural sense of showmanship, his voice smoothly tripping between a plosive singsong and an intense growl.</p><p>
<em>Bush Meat</em> also salutes concept album masters De La Soul, with seamlessly sequenced skits that are inseparable from the imagined landscape of the songs. ""Claati Bros"", a slyly satirical metaphor about selling art made of elephant dung, is book ended by skits that take place at an art show, where aristocrats with Oxonian accents gush over the scatological sculptures by ""Infinite Livez, a young black artist from the gay-to."" Others, like ""The Forest Spirit Sings the Bush Meat Song"", abandon hip-hop entirely in favor of cerebral, digitally mangled post-music soundscapes.</p><p>
    
    At this stage, when the playing field for British hip-hop in America is so small, it still seems useful to weigh Infinite Livez against the genre's stateside pacesetter, The Streets. While Mike Skinner's music focuses on the mundane, Steven Henry's zeros in on outsized, lowbrow absurdity (he claims Andre Breton and Robert Crumb as influences), embracing rap's more slapstick qualities. But as more British MCs make their way to American shores, Streets comparisons will fall by the wayside. As Pitchfork's own Tom Breihan rightly noted in his review of the Lethal B posse cut, ""Forward Riddim"", ""There are hundreds of MCs running around East London, and they're hungry."" We'll see the genre shed its novelty status in the American mind and take on the sort of full-bodied variegation that Infinite Livez embodies in a single LP. That's something to look forward to.</p></div>"|4157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4157-bush-meat/|7.8|Brian Howe

Therefore, it's not surprising when a gifted producer tries to take a star turn on the other side of the boards. But for every <em>College Dropout</em>, there are a thousand dust-covered copies of Mitchell Froom's <em>Dopamine</em> or Daniel Lanois's <em>Shine</em>.</p><p>
    
    Former Lightning Seeds singer Ian Broudie's first release under his own name, <em>Tales Told</em>, is destined to languish alongside the latter releases-- though not before its scattered moments of pop pellucidity spark some second thoughts. This former producer for Echo and The Bunnymen as well as The Fall has never confined himself to the production desk. In fact, Broudie got his break playing guitar for Big in Japan, whose other members later joined The Slits, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.</p><p>
    
    Best known for his shimmering synth-pop as the primary (and often sole) member of The Lightning Seeds, Broudie has taken a requisite turn toward the meditative on his first full-length since 1999's <em>Tilt</em>. Gentle guitars replace bouncy Casio tones, and Broudie is more likely to whisper words of regret than recite unabashedly over-the-top lyrics like ""love is the truth, I realize,"" from the Seeds' exquisite 1989 hit ""Pure"" (a clear precursor to The Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights"", in all its sappy glory).</p><p>
    
    Lead single ""Song for No One"" best bridges the gap between the Seeds' infectious optimism and the new album's quiet despondency. ""I'll kiss the world with fingers crossed,"" Broudie sings over sprightly acoustic arpeggios and shaken percussion befitting The Guild League. He always had the clear, uncertain voice of an innocent, and age has only slightly rumpled its edges.</p><p>
    
    At times the zaniness of Broudie's recent knob-twiddling work for fellow Liverpudlians The Coral and The Zutons seeps in, most regrettably during the closing vamp that disrupts the bright, Zombies-esque songcraft of ""Got No Plans"". Instrumental ""Super Cinema"", which opens with screeching violins and a ""Hit the Road Jack"" bassline, dances naked to the same hodgepodge 1960s rhythm as The Coral's best singles. But vaguely psychedelic lullabies like ""He Sails Tonight"" are more in line with ""Simon Diamond"" (or a glossy revamp of Pink Floyd's ""Green Is the Colour"") than, say, ""Zuton Fever"".</p><p>
    
    Title track ""Tales Told"" echoes the plodding guitar, stately orchestration and, you know, <em>title</em> of ""Telling Tales"", from 1994 Seeds effort <em>Jollification</em>. ""The time for telling tales is gone,"" Broudie observes. Instead, one presumes from the repeated lyric at the end of closer ""Something Street""-- ""that's how I feel""-- Broudie is telling his heart. If that's the case, then he's acquitted himself admirably, but the tales were better.</p><p>
<em>Tales Told</em> lacks the charm of the Seeds' most ebullient singles, and it's certainly no <em>Crocodiles</em>, either. But buck up, Mr. Broudie. I mean, Tim Robbins directed <em>Cradle Will Rock</em>, which was pretty good, but he starred in <em>The Player</em>, which was better, and fuck if <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> isn't on cable somewhere right now. Me? I'm still holding out for a more lucrative record deal.</p></div>"|1142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1142-tales-told/|5.9|Marc Hogan

No, seriously. Tear your ceremonial American Apparel sackcloth, dirty with your salon-tussled hair with sacrificial ashes, and thank Jehovah for almost a decade of Stones Throw goodness. I mean, who else would release a comp of late 1970s/early 1980s Connecticut hip-hop?</p><p>
    
    Since PB Wolf (aka Chris Manak) dropped his opening salvo with then-deceased best friend Charizma in 1996, Stones Throw has been hip-hop's avatar, preserving all the merriness of a South Bronx block party and the dedication of a sleepy-eyed cratedigger. Since then, Stones Throw has burgeoned into funk reissue kingpins and the home of some of the finest, most original hip-hop on either coast. To christen their 100th release-- a limited edition white vinyl EP-- PB Wolf and his decks birthed a 42-track mixtape covering the breadth of the label's work.</p><p>
    
    Needless to say, covering a label's entire collection is difficult-- especially considering the Stones Throw roster epitomizes idiosyncrasy. But Wolf's track selection is impeccable as he knits a seamless mix from a truly colorful yarn. (Besides, you can't go wrong when Madlib produces 70% of the tracks.) Charizma appropriately opens the retrospective with an Oliver Twist intro, an allusion to ST's dusty beginnings: ""In the b-boy stance, I'm in the smog all alone/ When I didn't have a mic, I rapped with headphones.""</p><p>
    
    From there, <i>ST 101</i> turns ""SportsCenter"": all highlights. From Yesterday's New Quintet's sonorous, lighthearted ""Young Girl"" to J. Rocc's cavernous breaks on ""Play This One"", PB Wolf dances through the ST catatlog, including a handful of oft-forgotten tracks from his funk subsidiary, Now-Again Records. Couldn't get enough of Hoagy Carmichael's fuzzy arrangements for Boston jazzmen Stark Reality? Lost your copy of Constitution State producer Dooley-O's 1990 12"" ""Watch My Moves""? Just can't bring yourself to buy from a group called Funkaho? The gang's all here.</p><p>
    
    And, of course, the unreleased and material is on-point. Jaylib's foggy ""Blaze Up"" introduces a J. Dilla cum Max Headroom, swimming in a vocoded abyss. Meanwhile, on Madvillian's ""Figaro"", Doom's <i>braggadocio</i> marries the Bollywood cuisine of Madlib's mysterious Beat #222.</p><p>
    
    If the mix CD doesn't clearly illustrate the Stones Throw sound, the accompanying DVD fills any gaps. From Madvillain's dazzling Stan Lee cartoon free-for-all on ""All Caps"" to the choreographed breakin' and poppin' on Breakestra's fiery ""Getcho Soul Together"", the videos provide a free-spirited alternative to music video's status quo. Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf's ""Red Light, Green Light"" is a hilariously dated collage of home video and live performance with the duo's head-bobbing antics from 1993. Jaylib's burlesque ""McNasty Filth"" is the only commercial fare but, don't worry, the girls ""volunteered"" to be in the video. (Way to be, kids.)</p><p>
    
    The bonus features are the weakest part of the collection. While amateur video of Egon interviewing Lester Abrams of the obscure Omaha funk octet L.A. Carnival may hold personal value for the ST staff, the segment comes off like an inside joke. Moreover, the footage of Jaylib's first performance in London is poor and far too short. It's nice to see Dooley-O rock the mic again, but most of the bonus section seems unnecessary. Fortunately, the rest of the set is nearly flawless.</p></div>"|2004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2004-stones-throw-101/|8.6|Jamin Warren

While the title <i>Working for the Man: The Island Years</i> might imply a more comprehensive retrospective, what we have here is instead something of a sampler platter covering the years 1992-1999, and intended to whet our appetites for the day these lavish reissues finally see domestic release.</p><p>
    
    One of the most brilliant and idiosyncratic (and now longest-lived) bands to emerge from Britain in the early 90s, the Tindersticks' timing was such that they quickly found themselves caught up in the wash of music press hype and Britpop bluster, and as an unfortunate result it seems their early records are far more often discussed than actually heard. Nevertheless, I don't think it's too outlandish to suggest that their luxuriant, melancholic orchestrations have exerted some degree of influence on acts such as Crooked Fingers, The Black Heart Procession, and Belle and Sebastian.</p><p>
    
    With their blankets of violin and keyboard organized cozily around Stuart Staples' weathered baritone, some critics have suggested that Tindersticks simply comprise the lite version of Leonard Cohen or Nick Cave's literate romanticism. In fact, I was put off the group for a brief time after my mother mentioned that she enjoyed them because Staples' voice reminded her of easy-listening giant Roger Whittaker. (Although, who knows-- with his songbird whistling and pipe-tobacco warmth-- perhaps Whittaker is overdue for a Burt Bacharach-style career reappraisal.) But the uniformly excellent songs collected on <i>Working for the Man</i> amply illustrate that Tindersticks possess the inventiveness and compositional muscle to be considered the peers of bands like the Bad Seeds rather than mere imitators.</p><p>
    
    Though the group has yet to release a bad record, most of Tindersticks' best ideas can be traced back to one of their first two albums (confusingly both are self-titled), so it's not surprising that each are well represented on this 11-song collection. Included here are such highlights as the galloping spaghetti western twang of ""Her"", the archetypal ""Tiny Tears"", which once served as a backdrop while a bathrobe-clad Tony Soprano gobbled Prozac, and ""Traveling Light"", Staples' debonair duet with The Walkabouts' Carla Torgerson. The main quibble about this set is its brevity-- for a band renowned for its expansive grandeur, a mere 11 tracks feels awfully skimpy. The tremendous Island-era album <i>Curtains</i> is only represented by one lonesome track, while the group's 1996 soundtrack for the film <i>Nenette et Boni</i> is ignored entirely.</p><p>
    
    Early pressings of <i>Working for the Man</i> include a second disc of B-sides and rarities that greatly enhances the collection's appeal. Though several of these rare songs prove to be pleasant but unremarkable piffle, this disc does contain crucial tracks like the group's impeccable covers of Pavement's ""Here"" (which arguably trumps the original Slanted and Enchanted version) and Townes Van Zandt's ""Kathleen"". Reportedly these tracks will not be included as extras on any other of the album reissues, so if you want 'em, you'd better hop to. And if you've waited until now to get your first glimpse of Tindersticks' verdant landscapes, <i>Working for the Man</i> may just be the porthole you've been seeking.</p></div>"|8075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8075-working-for-the-man-the-best-of-the-island-years-1992-99/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

Over the better part of their career, the band has been more closely associated with outrageous ego trips, prolific drug use, violent feuding, and bountiful sideburns than with their actual musical output.</p><p>
    The focus on the group's extra-curricular activities has been more magnified than ever since the release of Ondi Timoner's Sundance Grand Jury Prize-winning documentary <i>Dig!</i>, which candidly charts the relative career trajectories of the Brian Jonestown Massacre and their glossy nemeses, The Dandy Warhols.  Although Newcombe has issued statements on BJM's website and elsewhere denouncing the film's portrayal of him as a tantrum-prone, self-destructive megalomaniac, there can be little doubt that the documentary has also generated an unprecedented level of interest in the band's work.  Now, recognizing an opportunity to re-direct the attention of a curious public back onto the band's music, Tee Pee Records strikes with the massive two-disc retrospective, <i>Tepid Peppermint Wonderland</i>.</p><p>
    From a distance, Brian Jonestown Massacre's rivalry with the Dandys has always seemed faintly ridiculous, since choosing between these two wildly erratic, frequently mediocre acts is a little like asking your kid which he'd prefer for dinner: a jar of pimentos or a can of water chestnuts?  Though BJM can be an enthralling live act if caught on the right night, on record, their purebred Summer of Love psych-rock often suffers in comparison with their 60s formalist peers.  They lack the wit and virtuosic scope of The Bevis Frond or Major Stars; the prodigious melodic instincts of The Green Pajamas or the Elephant 6 hordes; and the pure galaxy-flattening mass of Comets on Fire or Acid Mothers Temple.  And needless to say, unlike such psych-inclined groups as Ghost, Sunburned Hand of the Man, or Boredoms, BJM have never betrayed any interest in attempting to transcend their influences in order to actually expand on rock's known territories.</p><p>
    So where does that leave us for <i>Tepid Peppermint Wonderland</i>?  With a full 38 tracks of Brian Jonestown Massacre's patented mid-tempo <i>Between the Buttons</i>-meets-<i>The Notorious Byrd Brothers</i>-meets-<i>Loaded</i> attack to plow through, that's where. The most remarkable thing about this career-spanning collection of older, rare, unreleased, and live tracks is to note how little the band's sound has appreciably changed over the course of their creative lifetime, despite all of the intra-band disharmony, wholesale line-up changes, and general turmoil. This fact is accentuated by the set's non-chronological running order, which places newer songs like 2004's ""If Love is the Drug"" cheek-to-jowl with BJM oldies like ""Wisdom"" or ""Stars"", which Newcombe claims is the first song he ever wrote on guitar. But the group's entire oeuvre is so entirely and uncannily of a piece that it's virtually impossible to date these tracks without checking the liner notes. So while you have to give Newcombe credit for keeping to his musical course regardless of outside trends or stimuli, you're also likely to wish that they could've incorporated more variety into their <i>Tepid</i> onslaught.</p><p>
    1996 was a particularly productive year for the band, and not surprisingly many of this collection's highlights are of that vintage. The three albums they released that year (<i>Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request</i>, <i>Thank God For Mental Illness</i>, and <i>Take It From the Man!</i>) essentially mapped out the boundaries of their sound, as evidenced on this collection by such inclusions as the hazy VU drone of ""Anemone"", the cosmic country jangle of ""It Girl"", and the loose-limbed R&amp;B; shuffle of ""Oh Lord"". How much you'll enjoy any given BJM track depends almost entirely on your fondness for its riff (my personal favorite here is a live version of the Cure-like ""Swallowtail"") because once Newcombe and crew latch onto a couple chords they'll typically ride 'em straight through until sunrise. On epic-length tracks like ""She's Gone"" or the set-closing ""Sue"", their steadfast repetition can quickly cross the thin line separating the hypnotically powerful from the merely tedious.</p><p>
    Particularly when you factor in these longer, more monotonous numbers, <i>Tepid Peppermint Wonderland</i> represents a numbingly large dosage (more than two hours worth) of Brian Jonestown Massacre. Significantly more, I daresay, than most listeners are going to require to get the point. Even if you're a newcomer with an appetite this will likely be all the BJM you'll ever need, and if pressed I'd suggest you instead get your hands on a copy of <i>Satanic Majesties' Second</i> and call it a day. Diehards may find joy in some of the previously unreleased nuggets included here, but the rest of us will continue to grow increasingly impatient for the day when the Massacre's musical feats can prove as adventurous as their off-stage exploits.</p></div>"|929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/929-tepid-peppermint-wonderland-a-retrospective/|6.5|Matthew Murphy

The first: my feet are mysteriously attached to a skateboard (Birdhouse deck, Thunder trucks, 55mm Creature wheels) and no matter how hard I try not to, I somehow land every trick-- even the physically impossible ones. The second: I am walking down the Ocean City boardwalk when I see a band of bums napping in cardboard boxes. In the dream, I think to myself, ""Wait a second. A band of bums..."", and suddenly I turn into a bum and convince the other bums to start a band with me. The bums are reluctant. Then there's a fight of some sorts, then there's the kissing, and seconds later I wake up holding my hunting rifle and a copy of Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i>.</p><p>
    
    The skateboarding dream always made sense to me, but the band of bums one I don't know, I just never understood the appeal. Things started to click two years ago. In real life, Philly band Man Man, then performing as Gamelon, would show up for gigs with about 50 people in tow, half of them pushing shopping carts filled with recyclables, the other half carrying musical instruments straight off the Island of Misfit Toys: legless upright pianos, bent horns, clarinets made of human flesh, etc. I imagine that several of these instruments were trash-picked or, at the very least, made from pieces of trash. Man Man played songs that sound like Tom Waits, Captain Beef, and Frank Zappa, but there was something earthier about them, something twisted and gross and grimy (but not <i>that</i> kind of grime). Tom Waits' songs are heavyweight boxing matches we watch on pay-per-view; Man Man's debut, <i>The Man in a Blue Turban With a Face</i>, is an epic street battle between two Vietnam war vets fighting over who gets to sleep on the sewer grate.</p><p>
    
    Brand me with a scarlet R-- ""R"" for Rockist, the target-du-jour of East Coast music-writer McCarthyism-- but I'm struck most of all by Man Man's honesty. Lead singer Honus Honus isn't trying to sound like Waits; he really just can't sing, and the screams and grunts are his best approximations. Man Man doesn't play guitars on these songs either-- not because they're trying to get the CMJ ""New Ideas in Indie Rock"" wheels spinning, and not because they're parodying that Chicks On Speed song-- but because guitars are expensive and bar chords probably bore them. Several Men-Men in Man Man have moustaches. This isn't Vice Party hyper-irony though; this is December in Philadelphia, and their upper lips are cold.</p><p>
    
    Funny thing is, Man Man are spinning wheels. Trade in the six-strings for some trumpets, violins, and preschool choirs, and songs like opener ""Against the Peruvian Monster"" come along: strong melodies play off droopy rhythms, and the screemy-meemy call-and-response exchanges at the end sound scarier than <i>Alien Vs. Predator</i>, maybe even <i>Leprachaun 2</i>. On ""10lb Moustache"", Man Man kitchen-sinks saxophones, marimba bells, animal sounds, and stolen Steinways into a dirty-mouthed theme song for mutiny. ""Zebra"" cops Fiddler's avant-klezmer dog barks and clarinet melodies for Love Gone Wrong, and tops them off with bluesy bitterness: at the end, a freaky chorus sings, ""You stung me bad/ What can I do?/ But leave the stinger in/ So I won't forget you."" ""Gold Teeth"" takes the bright kindergarten melodies of ""Peruvian Monster"" and covers them in Coketown soot. The song could be about anything with lines like ""Her hips are a warm sarcophagus"", but Man Man, for all the song's fingernail dirt, rusty shaves and sleepwalking, still sound really tender. These are songs kids like Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger listened to before crying themselves to sleep.</p><p>
    
    For the second half of <i>Man in a Blue Turban With a Face</i>, Man Man trade up melody for mania. The band touches on Need New Body territory before mustering the album's most focused narratives. The gritty-gorgeous ""I, Manface"" is a first-person Roman tale of a boy raised by wolves, and the similarly involved ""Werewolf (On The Hood Of Yer Heartbreak)"", Man Man's throaty doo-wop closer, goes something like, ""You're a diamond in the rough, baby/ A werewolf on the prowl, come and save me"", but with the charm of say Elvis' ""Don't Be Cruel"", or the Drifters' ""Under the Boardwalk"". Sounds crazy, I know, maybe even impossible. But just remember: under the boardwalk, down by the sea, there are probably bums sleeping, so try not to wake them.</p></div>"|5621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5621-the-man-in-a-blue-turban-with-a-face/|8.0|Nick Sylvester

We have no direct means of communication and even through our indirect means we can speak only in generalities like ""No!"" or ""Meow"" uttered with eyes fixed on the door that hides the food.</p><p>
    
    I mention this in conjunction with Zane Trow only because the other day when I was playing <i>For Those Who Hear Actual Voices</i> at home, the more vocal of my two cats began to sing along. Not really, of course, but he was mewing and howling as he often does and Trow's frequency modulations were coursing in their aquatic way through the room. The overall effect was as though the cat was somewhere in the recording, like some strange whale lost in Trow's deep sonic abyss. Last week, I was soaking in the album on the train and the sound of the warning that precedes the door to the rail car's closing rose from somewhere within the music. Bum-bum! It's not quite a perfect fourth, but it's close, and it coincided perfectly with the swell of the music-- I think it was track five, ""Louder Sleep"". I spent the rest of the day at work testing out how it sounded at a low volume in my cubicle, mixing with the constant overhead sound of the vents and the chatter of co-workers.</p><p>
    
    Although I couldn't always hear the album that well, looping as it was from the PC speaker under my desk, it would creep into my consciousness just often enough to give the day a profoundly different feeling from the others I've spent in that sterile tower. Pure FM synthesis has strange, unique qualities, and I've loved the sound ever since I first heard some of John Chowning's 1970s experiments with the technology. As academic as most of those recordings were, they still have a haunting beauty and natural logic to them, and that carries over into <i>For Those Who Hear Actual Voices</i>, which exploits similar techniques to beautiful results. The album has a graceful flow and almost supernatural glow that Trow heightens through subtle looping, delay, and laptop mulching.</p><p>
    
    The result is purely electronic music that feels like it could be a thousand years old; it has a permanence and the terrifying clarity of Caribbean shallows, where everything beside you is crystal clear, but the water's density causes objects to appear as if from nowhere in the distance. There are no tired, glitchy beasties coming out of that unknown here, though, and I'm grateful for that. For those familiar with the general aesthetic principles that guide most of the Room40 label's output, this will be yet another piece of nearly perfect ambient, and for the uninitiated, well, imagine what it'd be like to listen to a million shades of blue, and you're getting there.</p></div>"|8279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8279-for-those-who-hear-actual-voices/|7.8|Joe Tangari

As enjoyable and righteously fierce as Breather Resist are, they start and end with the Jesus Lizard. Caveat listener-- if you're uncomfortable with a group proudly wearing a seminal predecessor's influence on their sleeve, then Alt-Tab yourself out of this browser window and give your (hopefully) well-worn copies of <i>Liar</i> and <i>Goat</i> and <i>Bang</i> another go-around. On the other hand, if you're game to hear a group gamely reinvent the Judas Cradle, then you could do worse than to give these kids a chance.</p><p>
    
    So, yeah, it's pretty clear guitarist Evan Patterson holds Duane Denison in high regard. The way Patterson's winding, nauseous leads (cf. his careening string-bending in ""Amphetamine Praise"") slither around the shredded hoarse vocals and careen off of the stiff yet febrile rhythm section, one can't help but notice the similarities. Not that this is a bad thing-- Patterson should take pride in being able to both crunch numbers (as in the gear-shifting ""Honest to God"") and perform simple math (such as the spacious noodling introducing ""Loose Lipped Error"") with such violent grace.</p><p>
<i>Charmer</i> takes little time to get up to speed. The introductory track, ""An Insomniac's Complexion"", opens with three quick hits, pauses for a moment atop a bed of squealing feedback, and then begins thrashing. The group can squeeze five minutes' worth of song into 120 seconds (""A Passing Glance""), stretch their hyper kinetic pummeling out to comfortably fit a six-minute frame (""Amphetamine Praise""), and switch seamlessly between pensive throbbing and full-on fury without breaking stride. (Take your pick from any of the 11 tracks; I'll stand behind the aforementioned opener.)</p><p>
    
    Though the sturm and drang the group regularly summons doesn't fail to impress, the quieter moments sprinkled sparingly throughout-- the guitar/trumpet duet that introduces ""As Far as Goodbyes Go"", the two minutes of relative quiet at the start of ""Loose Lipped Error"" slowly ratcheting the level of tension, and the scream at the end of the CD that morphs into what sounds like a sped-up bagpipe track digitally castrated-- might be more impressive. It's easy to just hit the one note and hold it; it takes skill and confidence to try different tacts, and it's a whole different proposition to try these sorts of changes at the speeds Breather Resist achieve.</p><p>
    
    And, lest we forget, while the band grinds their way through these taut catharses, there's vocalist Steven Sindoni riding the wave and doing his best to splay his vocal chords through volume and will. If you can actually make out any words he's screaming, then kudos to you-- it's not as if Sindoni offers any help. The few moments of vocal clarity I found were quickly subsumed and subdued. Granted, in the wake of a glorious racket such as the stuff Breather Resist concoct, it's more important to get across to the listener the unfettered aggression and fury of the music as a whole than to be implicitly understood. Breather Resist send that message out loud and clear. And I do mean loud.</p></div>"|1141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1141-charmer/|7.4|David Raposa

For one thing, she's responsible for one of the best acoustic guitar strums of 2004-- the simple notes that usher in ""Stray Paper"", the opening cut off her new album <i>Tambourine</i>. They're everything they should be and nothing more: thick, melodic and in service to the singer. And when coupled with the track's lyrics, the song suggests a stately Neil Young, but with Merritt's composed, gorgeous voice rather than a world-weary falsetto.</p><p>
    
    Already recognized for her heralded 2002 debut, <i>Bramble Rose</i>, Merritt is still languishing in pop purgatory, but <i>Tambourine</i> has all the makings of a smash. Recorded by George Drakoulias (who helmed albums for The Black Crowes and The Jayhwaks) and with session musicians instead of Merritt's backing band, the album dresses simple, solid Americana in glamorous, well-cut attire, swerving clear of prevalent mainstream gags such as goofy humor, crystalline production, and schmaltzy narratives. Instead, Merritt veers toward a more soulful sound: Tracks like ""Ain't Looking Closely"" and ""Wait It Out"" are classic backporch power pop, while ""Late Night Pilgrim"" sounds like Wilco had they hunkered down and refined their country licks instead of branching out into more experimental territory. And while these songs don't offer much variety, the buoyant, well-balanced instrumentation makes <i>Tambourine</i> a breezy listen.</p><p>
    
    Emerging singer/songwriters face a tough task: Establishing a distinct personality through subtle qualities in voice. Merritt is still working on her image-- for now, she's more likely to be described in terms of her forebears than in laudatory descriptors-- but on ""Good Hearted Man"" she gives her best shot. If the track's horn refrain sonuds familiar, that's because it swipes the opening notes from ""Pomp and Circumstance"". Fortunately, the high school graduation standard provides a fluffy foundation for Merritt to lay down her wishes and avowals. The song-- with its sprightly upbeat guitar hits, tinselly horns, and crooned backup vocals-- reveals an affection for Motown and classic American soul, a refreshing homage coming from a country singer. Merritt's lyrics are sentimental and unspectacular but her sanguine voice infuses otherwise run-of-the-mill verses about finding a suitable bedfellow with fresh blood.</p><p>
    
    And that's pretty much the norm for <i>Tambourine</i>. Who needs fancy words when an effortless turn of inflection can speak volumes? Merritt has a long way to go before she runs the risk of being mistaken for A-league stars like Emmylou Harris and Dusty Springfield. But that we can speculate about her one day achieving that status is itself a tremendous compliment.</p></div>"|5620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5620-tambourine/|7.3|Sam Ubl

His civil service is noble; too many greats were shoved to the side in many textbooks and ""hip, urban tastemaker"" namedrops that typically praise the graces of Cage, Stockhausen, Russolo, etc. Hinant was also guilty of sacrificing a few goats to these deities in his first <i>Anthology</i>. However, Hinant took his second volume into greener hinterlands. He featured the likes of BBC sound designer Daphne Oram and David Lynch collaborator/<i>Eraserhead</i> soundtrack mastermind Alan R. Splet, and he ended this set of noise and electronic music with a Captain Beefheart spoken-word performance.</p><p>
    
    Hinant actually apologizes for the shortcomings of his third volume, which focuses on Germany's electronica heritage. His survey introduces a few laudable drone and <i>musique concrete</i> artists, but gives little sense about the German electronic aesthetic. The faces of Kraftwerk, Oval, Mouse on Mars, and even <i>Der Pate Stockhausen are missing. The great krautrock legacy is reduced to Neu's Michael Rother drifting to sleep on the Autobahn with Jaki Liebezeit playing with his seatbelt in ""Feuerland"", and a tiny excerpt of </i><i>The Faust Tapes</i> that shall fly over heads. German post-techno doesn't get much justice either: Carsten Nicolai's ""time...dot (3)"" will remind one of the ""clicks and cuts"" backlash, and Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg donates a decent but monotonous recording of a chugging engine he recorded when 16.</p><p>
    
    For the non-Germanic material, Hinant offers an often enticing survey of alien and hallucinatory soundscapes. Japanese warlord Merzbow will singe memories with ""Birds and Warhorse"". Masami Akita first discomforts with peaceful birdsongs heard through a hazy cell phone-- causing me to flinch as I anticipated a thermonuclear blast of feedback at any moment. And, by gar, the bastid delivers. The birds wail like mistaken SARS carriers on their way to a government biohazard disposal-- the monolithic distortion and digital hardcore beats drive the death march.</p><p>
    
    Michel Chion also bites the neck with ""Requiem: Dies Irae"", a ballet of bathtub operas, whispered group chants, and theatrical death threats. Another fine mutation is Bernard Parmegiani's ""De Natura Sonorum: Matieres induites"". He first sandpapers synapses with microtonal brine that bleeds into rainfall with tossed trash cans and guitar pings following suit. Other bafflers include a warehouse air fumigator that skitters and blows ashes in Justin Bennett's ""Ovipool"", Francisco Lopez's hyper-real document of insects muttering at overhead jetliners in ""Untitled #148"", and the liquefied crunch of stones in Scott Gibbons' ""Stone: Reciprocal"".</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Anthology</i> dwells in kitchen-sink collages and white noise indulgence best left to term-paper footnotes. The closer, ""Eternal Love #3""-- by Swedish minimalist techno unit Phauss, along with composer CM von Hausswolff and filmmaker Erik Pauser-- fails to seek transcendence with Geiger counter clicks and lawnmower guitar hums. Where's Beefheart when we need him?</p></div>"|11711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11711-an-anthology-of-noise-electronic-musicthird-a-chronology-1952-2004/|7.1|Cameron Macdonald

Textbooks sometimes talk about chaos in terms of fluctuating animal populations, unpredictable weather patterns and ""strange attractors"", but it's everywhere, all the time. And paradoxically, there's order in it. If you put a thousand people on a deserted island, they'll turn into a society. It might seem hard to predict what they'd do for more than a very short period at a time, but if you graph their behavior, they start to look pretty orderly. Computer programs help diagram elaborate formations of tiny spirals that form massive, spiraled fractals to describe, say, the economic tendencies of your new, island society. Chaos is an attractive idea, not just because it often seems to match with daily life experiences intuitively well, but also because it feels like something nature has been trying to tell us all along.</p><p>
    
    For all their unpredictable behaviors, Brooklyn's Excepter has individual parts that are easy enough to see. John Fell Ryan (ex-No Neck Blues Band), Dan Hougland, Macrae Semans, Caitlin Cook, and Calder Martin are-- along with groups like Wolf Eyes, Black Dice, Gang Gang Dance, and Sightings-- the new sound of chaos. They share musical similarities to This Heat, Can, and Faust, in as much as most bands playing ""fractal noise"" (what I would call Excepter's sound; ""fractal"" representing the idea that ordered patterns arise from disorder) are similar to them. However, that's not the same thing as saying those bands necessarily influenced Excepter. Rather, they are all in the continuum of musicians exploring/exploiting chaos in rock.</p><p>
    
    So, yeah. Sounds kind of complicated (or just convoluted), right? It's not, really. From the seemingly limited array of possibilities that should come out of five people playing ""progs"", sampler, synth, and percussion, comes a bizarre artifice, albeit with a beautiful intrinsic logic. Excepter are ""important"" to me for the same reasons I believe they'd be important for anyone into the idea that music can represent culture, in the most general way-- so general, in fact, that it's hard to see unless you step back to look at the patterns. None of this is to say Excepter are trying to be chaotic or noisy; rather, their kind of organization is born from kernels of sound allowed to branch out into (near) infinity, restricted by nothing more than its own feedback-- much like the chaotic behavior of economies or weather.</p><p>
    
    Fusetron's CD issue of <i>KA</i> (originally on vinyl in 2003) includes Excepter's incredible 2004 <i>Vacation</i> EP. It makes a very convincing case that the superficially, peripherally related worlds of electro-acoustic improvisation, IDM, psychedelic rock, and minimalism can not only be joined, but done so in a fashion both natural and ingenious. ""Vacation"" and ""Forget Me"" are particularly so, and comprise some of the most fascinating music I've heard this year. Over a simple, persistent drum-machine pulse, disembodied voices, both male and female reverberate through clouds of synth and echoed timbales. The tonality is decidedly major, but with sharp minor-7ths straight out of Can's ""Quantum Physics"" from <i>Soon Over Babaluma</i>. In fact, if you can imagine that piece slowed down by half, but twice as dense, you're getting close to ""Vacation"". It's impenetrable in the best sense.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>KA</i> is less attractive but hardly less interesting. ""Shattered Skull"" features more ghostly voices, but replaces rhythmic pulse with the ebb and flow of a two-note loop and shaken percussion, sounding like blades of dry grass tied together. ""See Your Son"" is similarly mysterious but spookier, eventually converging on a chorus of voices in no particular harmony except during random, brief consonant asides. ""Be Beyond Me"" brings the drum machine back, though the feel of the track is turbulent where ""Vacation"" had been sublime. The track fades out in a drone, attaching a subtle synth pattern to the bass drum pulse in a way thousands of minimal techno tracks have, but never approaching watercolor bliss; rather, it's an imperfect model of repetition and mood. The one-minute ""Breast of the Wave Offering"" obscures the pulse by muffling the entire production and drenching it with bass drone and what sounds like homemade electronic squeaks. It segues into the wild ""The Fire and the Wood"", behaving like the unhinged cousin of Black Dice's <i>Creature Comforts</i>, digital animal kingdom and all. The untidy patterns are everywhere and chaos abounds.</p></div>"|2912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2912-ka/|8.4|Dominique Leone

Since the <em>Long Live the Well-Doer</em> was created, Arbouretum have developed into a touring band with a full roster; they're recording a group album now. But this record is primarily the work of Heumann and drummer David Bergander, and the skimpy lineup contributes to its clarity of vision and lucid specificity. The record rings with the quiet purity of a pin dropped on tile, locating its force in translucence and strategic omission.</p><p>
<em>Long Live the Well-Doer</em> is rather unusually divided into two distinct songwriting styles-- austere yet richly detailed instrumentals and majestic, lo-fi indie folk anthems. The demarcation is clear: Heumann doesn't allow the two modes to blur together; he deliberately counterpoises one against the other in precarious, hypnotic equilibrium. The most striking antecedent is Dave Pajo's Papa M project, particularly the instrumental/lyrical dichotomy and mirage-like shimmer of <em>Whatever, Mortal</em>.</p><p>
<em>Long Live the Well-Doer</em> immediately sets about conjuring the wilderness it wearily traverses with ""Sands and Sands"", with its intermittent cascades of clattering percussion, the ebb and flow of slithering arpeggios, and distant chimes. On ""I Am a Somnambulist"", a baroque acoustic guitar figure morphs into a ramshackle dirge of shuffling electric guitar and patchwork strings, as if a DJ were crossfading Six Organs of Admittance into Califone. ""Early Bird Gets the Worm"" changes gears, collapsing the other instrumentals' spacious atmospheres into linear articulations of forward momentum, with its clicking drums, rigid wire of guitar, lyrical bass line, and squealing electric leads.</p><p>
    
    The savage blankness of the instrumentals is tempered by vocal tracks that ascend like beacons, their brightness amplified by the murky distances between them. ""Sands Upon Sands"" bleeds into ""Jonas Got a Tooth"", a (smog)gy four-track epic that unveils Heumann's matter-of-fact baritone-- it's a long crescendo described via muted, incremental shifts in intensity and rhythm. ""Don't Let It Show"" is a staticky, coasting lament that seems always on the verge of grinding to a halt-- like melancholic moans drizzling over a plodding folk ballad. And on ""All That Has Come Isn't Gone"", Heumann parades up and down his range, his voice cracking and stretching through crisply enunciated vocal glissandos. Profiting from the tension between these two modes, <em>Long Live the Well-Doer</em> is a startlingly fine (if discomfortingly barren) expanse of windswept aridity, a haunted and piercingly simple desert music limned in stark silhouettes and sepia tones.</p></div>"|460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/460-long-live-the-well-doer/|7.5|Brian Howe

Both of these guys have gone through stretches of writing more pop songs per year than you'd think anyone would except as a stunt-- you imagine them waking up and writing one while the coffee drips, another before the toast pops, a single in line at the bank, and a couple of B-sides while sitting in traffic. Put Boyracer in a room and point cheap mics in their direction and they'll give you endless happy fast-strumming guitar-pop, stuff that sounds like exuberant English indie children in a garage in 1987. They love The Smiths but they're <i>in love</i> with The Pastels; if the packaging matched the content, the CDs would come wrapped in Scotch tape and loose-leaf.</p><p>
    
    Except that Anderson isn't messing around, and that's what elevates this stuff: Despite the rickety joy, these are good serious pop songs. The ones on <i>Happenstance</i> may not be as consistent as on the band's last LP, <i>To Get a Better Hold You've Got to Loosen Yr Grip</i>-- the first half runs to the mediocre-- but they're more varied, and in a lot of cases more serious, more emotionally affecting. At best they start to pick up on the same charm that used to carry Belle and Sebastian-- real-life recordings of a band in a room, bashing out reckless pop with an unambitious purity that immediately wins you over. Different context, same half-nostalgic postcard allure; more machine-gun drumming and guitar feedback; noisy little notes from here and there.</p><p>
    
    I read a recent complaint that the problem with Boyracer full-lengths is never knowing which tracks to put on your mix-tapes. Pretty spot-on for this collection: All 23 of these songs are about 1:30 long and hard not to like. By my count at least nine are certifiably cool, and unlike that last full-length they run to pop crooning (and pianos!) as much as guitar buzz. ""How Many Cars can You Fit in Your Garage"" sounds like a blooper from a Smiths Peel Session; ""A Chipped Tooth and Greasy Fingers"" has a creaky punkoid quality that'll sound great in cars come summer. ""I Thought Even More of You When You Told Me You Wanted Me Dead"" just looks great on a mix listing, but I'm going with ""On Bleached Gras"", which is simple old-school indie pop of the first order.</p><p>
    
    Which is the thing here: good old English band-in-basement indie pop, totally unnecessary but endlessly charming, ever winning hearts and minds in the cozy apartments of Unrest nostalgists and the suburban bedrooms of Clientele fans. It's all too modest to go telling people they need to hear it-- but if anyone does the hard work of collecting Boyracer's two-minute gems into one 74-minute collection, it'll kill.</p></div>"|899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/899-happenstance/|7.0|Nitsuh Abebe

The interdependence of sound and vision are such that the spectacle of some character flipping his leg behind his neck while he juggles two records is perfectly reasonable as long as those two records are an old funk 45 and a Godzilla sound effects platter. Not only that, to become the creme de la creme, that same character is not allowed to repeat the feat two shows in a row, lest he dare wedging the panties of a thousand air-scratching credibility auditors. Mix Master Mike is one of the rare breed to dominate every corner of the turntable culture. He's the fanboys' favorite world champion, the old-timers' anointed torchbearer, and the ambassador to the mainstream, as appointed by The Beastie Boys. Yet, despite his credentials, his records are boring.</p><p>
    
    Take the title track, ""Bangzilla"".  It's basically a Prodigy demo without that screaming idiot trouncing all over it, supplanted by Cold War samples and Parkinsonian scratching.  Now, if you were in a small venue watching the video close-ups of Mix Master's hands twitching like a <i>Thriller</i> zombie all over the place, you could probably cup your hand over your mouth and declare, ""Oh, snap!"" or something.  But on record, as far as you know, he put a vibrator on the turntable and went for a sandwich. The rest of the album follows suit. The beats are slabs of gray concrete to be scribbled and tagged over with inexorable displays of wikky-wikked film noir snippets in lieu of any coherent mood or theme. The more impressive bits will raise some eyebrows on first listen, but that's exactly where Mix Master loses out to a fellow cratedigger like DJ Shadow, whose albums are less about technical prowess than impressionist sample layers. While Shadow might not stand up to Mix Master in a battle, he understands that the production album is not a proving ground. Mix Master has little to prove.</p><p>
    
    In Doug Pray's 2001 film, <i>Scratch</i>, Mix Master has a scene where he runs through the basics of scratching in what looks like his mom's basement. It's like watching Lebron James show a fat white dude how to dunk. When Mike's done with the lesson, he rips the proverbial rim off your garage with an improvised assault on his poor little turntables. And then, of course, there are his live shows with the B-Boys where he interpolates whatever the fuck he feels like in the middle of the group's classics, enlivening the Boys' dog and pony show.</p><p>
    
    Inevitably, connoisseurs of the genre will snap up this album like it's a mint copy of ""Skull Snaps"" because it will serve as a mnemonic device for the times they've witnessed Mix Master Mike move a crowd. But for the casual listener, <i>Bangzilla</i> is nothing more than a mechanical curiosity.</p></div>"|5339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5339-bangzilla/|5.0|Peter Macia

The eighth deadly sin must surely be the curse of objectivity.  By now, having been lucky enough to spill my guts all over this site on such diverse topics as the ghosts of GBVs past, present, and future, the myth of Robert Pollard, and a religious experience at a long-gone concert when it seemed like the band might just be the answer to any question rock 'n' roll wanted to ask, it may seem that my objectivity is in short supply.  It is.  The part of me that holds an irrational, almost baseless devotion to Robert Pollard's hissed-out anthems is screaming ""10!"" from the back of my brain, and it only takes a listen to the restless ghosts of ""The Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory"", or the rejuvenated arena dinosaurs of ""Buzzards and Dreadful Crows"" to weaken my resolve.  But something's wrong, and every time that voice speaks up and asserts this album's perfection, it's shouted down by a simple, immutable truth: ""If it's right, you can tell.""</p><p>
    
    Guided By Voices got it right back in 1994.  <i>Bee Thousand</i> is the band's definitive moment, the point when the ringing Who-isms of Pollard's youth-- filtered through four-tracks and his own post-punk, X-Men, stream-of-consciousness quirks-- finally matured beyond the atonal growing pains of <i>Vampire on Titus</i> and <i>Propeller</i>.  The distinction was slight but unmistakable-- like learning to harness all the jaw-dropping, stadium-quaking power of <i>Propeller</i>'s triumphant exclamation (""I'm much greater than you think!"") without all the run-up or refining the unworked defiance of ""Exit Flagger"".  On <i>Bee Thousand</i>, GBV mastered all those fragments of greatness and assembled an entire album from them.  Sure, it stumbles occasionally, and falters as only four
    spare-time, blue-collar bandmates from Dayton, Ohio can-- that is, humanly and forgivably-- but the original <i>Bee Thousand</i> simply stands alongside the greatest of the modern era.  The original warrants a 10.</p><p>
    
    So what of <i>The Director's Cut</i>? Shouldn't this just be a bionic <i>Bee Thousand</i>? In what parody of a just universe is this not every ounce of the original plus whatever else was left over? I feel faint...</p><p>
    
    Track sequence, it turns out, is really, really important.  This new, expanded version of the record includes an early, 33-track sequence.  It's spread out over four vinyl sides, along with another record containing the standard <i>B1000</i> tracks that weren't initially included, as well as <i>The Grand Hour</i> and <i>I Am a Scientist</i> EPs.  Unfortunately, this original sequence is so bafflingly unsatisfying that it might've kept Guided by Voices in the basement for another decade had clearer heads not eventually prevailed.</p><p>
    
    ""I Am a Scientist"" first earned GBV a measure of notoriety and in some small way helped legitimize the rise of lo-fi to minor prominence in the early 90s; sadly, it wouldn't even have been included on <i>Bee Thousand</i> (here, it's relegated to the extras and outtakes disc).  And that's least of the original's tracklist problems: The ""new"" material in the early sequence is composed almost entirely of <i>Suitcase</i> and <i>King Shit and the Golden Boys</i> tracks-- material that was substandard even on those collections of outtakes.</p><p>
    
    The burden is only slightly ameliorated by an older, thinner version of the otherwise classically bombastic concert staple ""Postal Blowfish"" (better reprised on the <i>Brain Candy</i> soundtrack), a four-track demo of ""It's Like Soul Man"", and a few lazy, acoustic charmers like ""Indian Was a Angel"" or ""Supermarket the Moon"".  But for every new highlight, there's an equally inaccessible ""Deathtrot and Warlock Riding a Rooster"" or ""Zoning the Planet""; the resultant load proves to be a little too heavy for even classics like ""Echoes Myron"" to completely bear.</p><p>
    
    With the remains of the final cut haphazardly tacked on at the end, in addition to a thoroughly mixed bag like <i>The Grand Hour</i>, and almost-redundant alternates of both ""Shocker in Gloomtown"" (included <i>twice</i> in the span of four tracks, and yet still valuable for the energy infusion it provides both times) and ""I Am a Scientist"", the ""bonus record"" is as slapdash as <i>The Director's Cut</i> itself.  Thankfully, a fantastic unreleased version of ""My Valuable Hunting Knife"" ends this ordeal on perhaps its highest note, dispensing with the haunting atmospherics found on the <i>Alien Lanes</i> version and plunging into a sea of churning guitar and a clipped, punchy vocal performance from Pollard.</p><p>
    
    Of course, a phenomenal finish isn't quite enough to correct the confusing missteps of the previous hour.  Despite containing the core of one of the most stunning, unexpectedly triumphant records ever recorded, and a few wonderful tracks besides, <i>Bee Thousand: The Director's Cut</i> manages the almost impossible feat of reducing itself to a merely good album with some incredible highlights-- maddeningly similar to almost every other album our beloved Fading Captain has ever tossed off.  The slipshod nature of this expanded reissue serves only to prove two things: for better or worse, GBV is ever Robert Pollard's child (and thankfully Tobin Sprout was around to shepherd it, at least for a time), and that the final edit of <i>Bee Thousand</i> is every bit the miracle it sounds.</p></div>"|3600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3600-bee-thousand-the-directors-cut/|8.4|Eric Carr

One of DJing's founding fathers, Siano has recently made print and television appearances as well as a return to the live circuit; now we have <i>Nicky Siano's The Gallery</i>, a Soul Jazz-sponsored collection of early favorites from the legendary New York nightclub.</p><p>
    
    Although the word ""disco"" features prominently on the cover, <i>Gallery</i> more accurately is proto-disco or, better yet, primordial-disco. Spanning soul, funk, gospel, and rock, its 17 tracks are united more by a bustling energy than a faithfulness to any one genre. It's not a disco history lesson, but a testament to how exciting and new those exploratory mid-70s sets must have felt. From the inlay photos of Siano and a young Larry Levan decorating the venue with balloons to the charmingly unfinessed way that these different tracks run into each other, <i>Gallery</i> succeeds at communicating the thrill of being in on something from the beginning.</p><p>
    
    It also smolders, something you might not expect from a collection of album cuts and b-sides. Featuring a perfectly executed build, a 13-armed drum break, a narcoticized bass solo, a complete instrumental meltdown and a goosebump-inducing outro, The Isley Brothers' ""Get Into Something"" folds about 12 individually wonderful moments into its seven-and-a-half minutes. Just as tremendous is The Pointer Sisters' rendition of Allen Toussaint's ""Yes We Can Can"", which starts by coasting on a brittle, midtempo rhythm then explodes over the course of its six minutes into a loose, jubilant call-and-response.</p><p>
    
    The remaining tracks can basically be divided into two sections: the soul/funk cuts that map out as disco's direct precursors (Loleata Holloway's ""We're Getting Stronger"") and Siano's more esoteric, far-out selections. With its clickety percussion, whistles, and brittle acoustic guitars, Exuma's ""Exuma - The Obeah Man"" triangulates African folk, Tropicalia, and American roots; elsewhere, the arms-up gospel of Gloria Spencer's ""I Got It"" and the swirling keyboard rock of Bonnie Bramlett's ""Crazy 'Bout My Baby"" hammer home just how wide Siano's umbrella must have been.</p><p>
    
    Anyone who's ever seen a grade-A crate digger fall on his face can tell you that the best DJs aren't the most knowledgable ones, they're the most generous ones. And if <i>The Gallery</i> is anything to go by, Siano-- even 20 years removed from his glory days-- still manages to be both.</p></div>"|1994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1994-nicky-sianos-the-gallery/|8.4|Mark Pytlik

They are not merely psychological but physical, and, as any tongue-tied 7th-grader knows, they have weight. Music is how they breathe-- through clenched teeth or a lover's soft exhale. The Owls' debut ""mini LP,"" <em>Our Hopes and Dreams</em>, gracefully explores the vacuum left behind when they escape, like helium from a popped balloon afloat somewhere between Sarah Records and <em>Past Masters Volume Two</em>.</p><p>
    
    Opening track ""Air"" provides the pin. After an incantatory verse and skidding bass fill, multi-instrumentalist Maria May introduces the disc's koan-like vision with a deceptively simple couplet: ""There is only air/ Where I used to care."" A few tracks later she will be ""looking down over everything"" but for now, her breathy vocals are just beginning to flutter in the breeze, held aloft by acoustic guitars, piano, scattershot drums and-- nope, I don't even inhale-- a heavenly duet with The Legendary Jim Ruiz Group's Allison LaBonne. Plus, unlike that Ben Folds song a few years back, this ""Air"" doesn't even have painful associations with <em>Godzilla</em>.</p><p>
    
    LaBonne's compositions hold up admirably alongside the more immediately arresting opener. Her ""Do Ya?"" has much in common with the irrepressible ""Air"" -- its deliberate pacing, oft-repeated chorus, and whispery harmonies -- but the capricious lyrics (""I think I might blow your poor house down"") flesh out May's minimalism with greater humanity. ""Drop Me a Line"" provides a darker, wind-swept sequel to the dizzy high and bare acoustic guitars of May's ""From Far Away"". LaBonne's voice drips with desolation: ""Drop me a line when you get there, far away/ I know you may never get there/ But you'll stay."" Unfortunately, she also proffers the disc's most insipid track, the daintily sing-songy ""Baby Boy"". This tune's goofy back-and-forth is a powerful argument against piano lessons.</p><p>
    
    The Owls' most famous member, relatively speaking, is bassist Brian Tighes, frontman for Minneapolis power-pop mainstays The Hang Ups. He also happens to be LaBonne's husband. Tighes' lone songwriting contribution here, ""Forever Changing"", picks up where the classic 60s pop influences on The Hang Ups' self-titled 2003 release left off, with mellotron, instrumental passages that evince the ""sitting in an English garden"" bit of ""I Am the Walrus"", and the occasional handclaps. The title nod to Love is apt.</p><p>
    
    Clocking in at nearly 25 minutes, the eight-song disc closes with ""Even Now"", written by drummer and fellow Hang Up Stephen Ittner, who has since left the band. With a shushing sibilance straight out of ""Come Together"" and a guitar solo befitting that single's double a-side, he tears out where he used to care and plugs it with bitter resignation-- smiling and melodic all the while. ""I will never change my mind,"" he insists. An ephemeral record that wafts gently in the clouds somewhere damn near the Platonic indie pop ideal returns to Earth at last like a lovesick comet on his final, raucous word: ""Yeah!""</p></div>"|6074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6074-our-hopes-and-dreams/|7.7|Marc Hogan

No wonder the latter has been so extensively mythologized in America's books, films, and music.</p><p>
    
    In the Western mind, Japan is often a trope for mystery and otherness, and two contrary images of it exist simultaneously, like a double exposure: A samurai scheduling his honorable suicide in a Palm Pilot. One can observe our collective vision of Japan evolving, as rapidly as the culture itself, from one of historical fantasy to one of futuristic wonder. It's the Japan of <em>Lost in Translation</em>-- a garish, hyper-accelerated land of rampant technological advance and debased tradition-- that's dominant today.</p><p>
    
    Ninja Tune tends to be good at picking out international acts that avoid caricature, and Japanese duo Rainstick Orchestra's debut eschews the Western vision of Japan as a pinball machine full of lab rats. They also don't cleave to the imagined Japan of old, which occurs to us as a blur of cherry blossoms and hedge gardens, scented with vaguely detected aromas of honor, humility, feudalism, solicitousness, and quietude. </p><p>
    
    Since America is so fascinated by Japanese culture, it's no surprise that the Japanese are intrigued by the U.S.'s as well, and Rainstick Orchestra's polite, placid debut evinces no overt connection to its creators' native country. Instead, it assimilates Western fragments-- the minimalist, avant-garde compositions of Reich and Cage; the breezy demeanor of AM Gold pop and smooth jazz; chill-out techno and laid-back funk; liquid glitchcore; maybe a little Sam Prekop or Archer Prewitt-- into a glassy, frictionless surface of meditative geniality. The duo's electronically sequenced clouds of guitar, bass, piano, and synthetic sound effects have an airy, fluid quality that echoes in both their moniker and the album's, although ""Muzak for Glass Elevator"" would have been equally apposite.</p><p>
<em>The Floating Glass Key in the Sky</em> takes its sweet time-- its seven tracks are longish, five to 10 minutes each, and develop in casually relentless inflections of detail and subtly shifting layers of repetition. ""Trick"" burbles and emotes with varied melodic percussion, fluttering piano, and expressive shadings of sliding bass tones. ""Waltz for a Little Bird"" is a romantically melancholic shuffle snatched from a 70s sitcom theme, all jaunty arpeggios and twinkling xylophone. ""Kiteletu"", besides the lively flute figure that peppers it, is less clear in its melodic intention, building itself from a swirl of sonorous rhythm that collapses into the piano dirge of its middle section.</p><p>
    
    ""Electric Counterpoint Fast"" finds Rainstick Orchestra reworking Steve Reich's collaboration with guitarist Pat Metheny into an imbricate cascade of digital tones and whispery trills, and the ethereal keys of album ender ""Closed Circuit"" ebb and flow over a metronomic hi-hat. <em>The Floating Glass Key in the Sky</em> understatedly demonstrates how technical complexity can achieve pristinely simple results when melody is given priority over esotericism.</p></div>"|6933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6933-the-floating-glass-key-in-the-sky/|7.3|Brian Howe

Most notably, his brother, drummer and co-founder Kurt Dahle, left in 2001 to join the star-studded Vancouver pop juggernaut New Pornographers. The Dahle brothers also worked together in the 90s pop group Age of Electric, so the disintegration of their longtime partnership could have presaged a noticeable shift in quality and content. But while <i>In/Out</i> is an uneven Limblifter release, its strongest moments suggest that neither the extended recording absence nor Dahle's departure has impeded the band.</p><p>
    
    Which isn't to say that Kurt's absence is entirely inconspicuous. The album's most glaring flaw is Burento Follett's weaker, more anonymous drumming, which follows his predecessor's simple, effective pop style but lacks a necessary propulsive energy. Many of these songs were initially crafted around drum loops, and the technique shows-- Dahle opts for a mechanical, nondescript rhythm section to back his more interesting vocal melodies and arrangements.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Get Money"" is the first of three forays into MOR rock radio fare, but it's redeemed by Dahle's knack for melody and compositional variation-- which is highlighted by an interesting post-punk section. ""Perfect Day to Disappear"" suffers from a blander, more repetitive approach, and ""Fiercely Co-Dependent"" adds little to the formula established by the previous tracks, coasting on a standard-issue circular guitar riff.</p><p>
    
    Though <i>I/O</i> is frontloaded with potential singles, Dahle's most interesting material appears in the album's latter half. ""Drug Induced"" layers a hazy guitar line over a Supertramp Wurlitzer foundation, veiling Dahle's bizarrely graphic lyrical imagery-- it's hard to imagine any context in which the line ""I'm gonna stop whoring from endorphins to the orphans of abortion"" wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb, but its concealment almost subliminally strengthens the track. ""Alarm Bells"" makes excellent use of understated string accompaniment, and the comparably gritty, garage-oriented ""On the Moon"" almost breaks though the sterility of the album's otherwise spotless production.</p><p>
    
    The album's weakest moments-- such as the awkward free-association rocker ""Jumbo Jet Headache""-- aren't dealbreakers, but Limblifter would benefit from the diversity that has characterized Kurt's work with New Pornographers. Limblifter too often rely on rigid, conventional pop structures designed to accentuate Dahle's inventive melodies, sacrificing the complexity hinted at in the album's strongest tracks. As a comeback from an extended hiatus, <i>I/O</i> re-establishes Limblifter as a skilled pop ensemble, but the band hasn't quite reclaimed the kind of energy and spontaneity that has defined their best work.</p></div>"|4974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4974-inout/|6.7|David Moore

The Last Supper?!  Nas is a prophet, check, but the Jesus Christ of hip-hop?  Then there's that poor sonuvabitch in the white.  Didn't he read <i>The DaVinci Code</i>? Doesn't he know he's standing in for Mary Magdalene, a prostitute?  Does he not understand how stupid he looks wearing a crucifix to The Last Supper?!  This may be the most unintentionally hilarious ""intentionally hilarious"" album cover I have ever seen.</p><p>
    
    Nas practically <i>needed</i> two discs to back this sort of shit up, which is perhaps one reason why <i>Street's Disciple</i> does the dirty double, with the first disc (purportedly) for the street, and the second one (purportedly) for the home.  Sounds gimmicky--
    and yes, it's ""sprawling,"" ""massive,"" ""has lots of filler,"" ""should have been one disc,"" etc.-- but guess what: It's cocksure and it works.  Relatively speaking, Nas is an old guy now.  He doesn't rob banks; he has babies and marries Kelis.  He doesn't narrate ghetto life in the glorious present; he reminisces and takes stabs at reform.  He no longer needs to prove himself; he just has to flow. Throughout <i>Street's Disciple</i>, Nas simply sounds confident, which is the key to pulling off tracks so thematically un-gangsta:
    When your best-known lyric is ""I never sleep 'cause sleep is the cousin of death,"" it can be tough to sell a line like, ""It was my night to watch my little girl.""</p><p>
    
    ""This ain't no sucka for love shit/ This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hugs shit/ First night we fuck shit and don't call the next day,"" says Nas on ""Getting Married"". In Nas' hands, the institution becomes an avatar of badassness, much like faith becomes-- to faith's chagrin-- a vehicle for bravado on the Barry White-sampling ""Nazareth Savage"" (""I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen""), or as education advocacy oddly becomes the new thug ideal on ""War"" (""Tell my daughter try her hardest so the best schools'll take her in"").  Nas hasn't mellowed on the mic; he just has different priorities-- and impressively, he doesn't eschew the present for the sake of his dated guns-drawn Queensbridge persona.</p><p>
    
    ""Live Now"" most powerfully sums up Nas' street-tough-to-hubby transformation.  Here, Nas describes his death-- not by bullets and rap romanticism, but by old age: ""My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me... Trying to say something/ The whole room'll quiet down just to hear my last words.""  Yet, in the same song, as if to counterbalance that tenderness, he anxiously rehashes his past: ""Admit I did live it a little bit/ Sweet pickle dick, freaks licked on it/ Lips I dripped on it/ Sex I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits.""  The rhyme feels forced, but maybe pointedly so. Nas realizes hip-hop doesn't like the sissy, and he's careful to balance such personal affairs with the requisite bravado.</p><p>
    
    Nas obviously has no trouble here, and for the most part, Chucky Thompson, Salaam Remi, and L.E.S. front the boards hard and hookless, keeping the focus on the lyrics.  Check ""Nazareth Savage"" (""I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the pus, get it?""), the token girls-I-fucked track ""Remember the Times"" (""Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick/ Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement""), or the previously released ""Thief's Theme"" (""Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd/ Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth"").  The content is the same as before, but the vantage point is a rocking chair: Nas presents his past as been-there-done-that, an abridged backstory included as a contrast to his present affairs, and perhaps as a concession to some listeners: ""I had to make a song, speakin' on my old life/ For the thieves who come out at night.""</p><p>
    
    The streets are paved with rags-to-riches rappers, but few of them keep the dirt on their shoulder after MTV and the first cool mill. If the Nas of <i>Illmatic</i> was fighting to get Nas out of the ghetto, the Nas of <i>Street's Disciple</i> is fighting to get the ghetto out of the ghetto.  The Q-Tip-produced ""American Way"" is politically untimely but fiery, with Nas bemoaning the black vote's impotence, and at one point calling Condoleeza Rice a ""coon Uncle Tom fool.""  On the equally vicious ""These Are Our Heroes"", Nas sarcastically salutes ""the coons on UPN9 and WB/ Who 'Yes, master' on TV,"" and calls out Tiger Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr., and ""Mr. Goody Two-Shoes"" Jay-Z for selfishness: ""What you doin' for the hood?""  The carps aren't novel-- as Nas points out, ""It's trendy to be the conscious MC/ But next year, who knows what we'll see?""-- but carry unusual weight from the Queensbridge darling.</p><p>
<i>Street's Disciple</i> shares in the missteps we can expect from both double-disc sets and Nas albums in general (a fair number of shitty beats, and the occasional bomb like ""I'm the disciple of music!""), but there's a compelling record in here somewhere, and that album is easily Nas' best in years.  For the past decade, he's tried to prove he can thug with the best; now unconcerned, he's caught a fresh breath.  <i>Street's Disciple</i> is flawed, but Nas' second wave of confidence is one of the most exciting things to happen to hip-hop this year.</p></div>"|5711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5711-streets-disciple/|7.2|Nick Sylvester

We know electronic producers by their signature sounds, the way we know singers by their voices or songwriters by their changes. While this has sometimes led to a concern with slight variation in search of novelty or what some describe as ""fussiness,"" artists like Triola's Jörg Burger work in a completely electronic realm yet focus on typically musical concerns such as rhythm, melody, and development rather than the latest processing tweaks.</p><p>
    Burger has been at the center of the fertile Cologne music scene since the early 90s, recording under aliases such as The Modernist and Bionaut in addition to a number of collaborations. While Burger released a lot of interesting tracks in a decade that saw electronic music go in a million different directions, he returns consistently to his straightforward and affecting sound-- the bright synth pads, gentle rhythms, and dubby production flourishes of early ambient house.</p><p>
<i>Im Funftonraum</i> is Burger's first album as Triola, after releasing a number of tracks under the name on Kompakt's revered <i>Pop Ambient</i> compilations. While those one-offs were excursions in beatless ambient, the tracks on <i>Im Funftonraum</i> have a relaxed-but-steady pulse of electronic percussion, suggesting chilled-out pop instrumentals. Anyone who knows Burger/Ink's <i>Las Vegas</i>, his collaboration with Wolfgang Voigt, will recognize the sound and construction on display here. The return to those sounds-- <i>Las Vegas</i> was recorded 10 years ago-- hints at Burger's disinterest in fashion.</p><p>
    ""Leuchtturm"" opens the album on a note of gauzy bliss, serving perhaps as a lead-in from the fuzzy dronescapes of <i>Pop Ambient</i>. The next track, ""Neuland"", lays out the ground rules for <i>Im Funftonraum</i>, with a cheery whistle of synth, a bouncy keyboard line, and plenty of space for the light to shine through. ""Unland"" adds just a hint of menace, with an echoing sample of buzzing guitar string laid atop the sort of nourish bassline Jan Hammer liked to work into the background of ""Miami Vice"".</p><p>
    ""Traumsch\x9An"" is a bit tougher than the rest, with a punchy electro bass and another couple dozen extra bpms to contend with, but the bulk of <i>Im Funftonraum</i> is placid, tuneful, and understated.

What is perhaps more unexpected, is that this collaboration is a resounding success. Then again, The Walkabouts' Chris Eckman's whispery rasp (which is similar to The Auteurs' Luke Haines) and the copious echo and tremolo of prime surf aren't that far removed from each other-- Johnny Cash and old trucker songs are good precedents. When The Molesters lower the lights and inject a hint of blues and jazz noir into their sound, it's a perfect match. The Croatian band's music is already spectacularly stormy and dramatic, and Eckman had previously delivered an arresting spoken performance on ""Ice &amp; Pinewood Trees"", from The Molesters' excellent second album <i>Sonic Bullets</i>, so there was some collaborative comfort between the two parties.</p><p>
    
    Anyone who thinks of surf as expressly sunny music will have their mind changed by this record. The dual guitars of Dalibor Pavicic and Dinko Tomljanovic are dripping in cavernous spring reverb, but Hrvoje Zaborac's roomy, understated drums and Lada Furlan Zaborac's slinking bass keep them rooted on dry land, free to roam every deep old-growth forest and poorly lit alleyway they can find. Occasional piano, organ, and trumpet darken the edges, and Eckman is the deadpan centerpiece, breathily narrating the blackness of the night with a delivery perched in the gray area between spoken storytelling and melody. He goes the furthest in the latter direction on ""These Lies"", a beautiful, mostly acoustic piece of jazz-inflected folk that somehow combines the feel of a campfire in the woods and the pools of light on an empty city street.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, guitars swirl in stately rings around Eckman, and it's quite clear that this is an equal partnership. The Molesters are never relegated to backing band status-- Pavicic dances with Eckman in a melodic call-and-response on ""Tonight, I Will Say Anything"" and then trades off with Tomljanovic's Spaghetti Western rattle in the spaces between verses. ""Tonight, I will say anything/ Any stupid, fucked-up thing/ Anything that helps,"" sings Eckman in a moment of desperation, a slight sneer rising at the corner of his lips. At his most intense, he whispers his lines with utter malevolence, like Jarvis Cocker on ""I Spy"", and his frantic take on Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's ""Villier's Terrace"" is thrilling. ""See It In the Dark"" is the kind of frightening waltz a SoCal Tindersticks might dream up, with lyrics about intra-marital homicide and a two-pronged guitar attack that hits with tangled leads in the high end and grinding, swaying chords in the low.</p><p>
<i>Nights of Forgotten Films</i> doesn't even feel like a collaboration-- the dynamic interactions between the players seems natural and consistently bracing. I already thought The Bambi Molesters were the best surf band in the world today, but it turns out that they're far, far more than just that, able to sublimate their thrashier tendencies in the service of a vocalist. Perhaps where this album succeeds is that there's nothing forced-- each party involved gets to play to its strengths and they effortlessly complement each other. So give credit to Eckman and his Croatian crew: <i>Nights of Forgotten Films</i> is everything a collaboration should be.</p></div>"|7795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7795-nights-of-forgotten-films/|7.8|Joe Tangari

For the better part of the past decade, Hayes has kept busy re-working this material intended for his Plush LP <i>Fed</i>. In his attempts to force the music to meet his exacting and ambitious standards, Hayes has allowed the production to flounder somewhere alongside <i>Chinese Democracy</i>, the <i>Loveless</i> sequel, and <i>Waterworld</i> in the pantheon of seemingly doomed creative projects.</p><p>
    
    As it now stands the album's backstory is arguably more interesting than the music itself. In the mid-90s, the lushly orchestrated <i>Fed</i> was conceived to be Plush's debut LP. But after early full-band sessions bore no fruit, Hayes instead released the solo piano album <i>More You Becomes You</i> under the Plush name in 1998; he resumed his work on <i>Fed</i> the following year. As time passed and recording costs began to mount, Drag City backed away from the project, leaving Hayes to reportedly spend more than $100,000 of his own money to pay for a steady succession of studios, engineers, and guest musicians. In 2002, Hayes was finally satisfied enough to allow <i>Fed</i>'s release but so far the album has only seen issue in Japan.</p><p>
    
    So now Drag City's Sea Note imprint presents <i>Underfed</i>, a so-called official bootleg version of <i>Fed</i>. Recorded in summer 1999 under the vigilant eyes of Steve Albini and Bob Weston, this early draft of the album features the same songs in the same order as they appear on <i>Fed</i>, but here they are stripped bare of the elaborate arrangements and layers of overdubs that buried them on the final mix. And it must be said (though it probably makes Hayes' pocketbook ache just to think about) that most of the songs sound just as good if not better in this more skeletal format. Perhaps <i>Underfed</i> will ultimately stand as a reminder that an excess of in-studio tinkering is just as like to spoil a well-written song as it is to perfect it.</p><p>
    
    Even without the extra pounds of strings and horns, the songs here are still quite reasonably fleshed out. (There are certainly many more lo-fi records in Drag City's back catalog.) Accompanying Hayes' vocals, guitars, and various organs are drummer Liam Murphy and Isotope 217 bassist Matt Lux. At his best, Hayes effortlessly recalls singer-songwriters like Harry Nilsson and Todd Rundgren, and throughout <i>Underfed</i> he performs with an amiable, we'll-fix-that-later laxity that allows excellent tracks like the opening ""Whose Blues"" or ""Greyhound Bus Station"" to swing more freely than their brassier <i>Fed</i> counterparts. Even by the time of these recordings, however, turgid numbers like ""So Blind"" and ""What'll We Do?"" seem to carry the scars of their difficult birth-- Hayes' vocals sound sullen and distracted, as though he's already beginning to lose his inspiration in the material.</p><p>
    
    If you've gotten your hands on an imported copy of <i>Fed</i>, it can be fun (well, diverting) to go through and do a track-by-track comparison with these earlier versions. And though you'll notice that ""Sound of San Francisco"" eventually gained a lovely little <i>Abbey Road</i>-like intro, and the stuttering funk of ""I've Changed My Number"" is undoubtedly enhanced by the full-horn treatment, it's also interesting to note how little Hayes altered the basic structures of the songs when he added extra coats of glossy instrumentation. This seems to be an implicit acknowledgement that whatever virtues these songs might possess were already well in place by 1999.</p><p>
    
    Hayes reportedly has plans to return yet again to these songs for another round of remixing before he tries to finally get a completed version of <i>Fed</i> released domestically. Personally, I think he'd be better off burning all the masters, sowing the ground with salt, and walking away with a copy of <i>Underfed</i> as his only souvenir from this whole crazy affair.</p></div>"|6358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6358-underfed/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

The piece can only be heard-- it can mean everything or absolutely nothing. No words or anything recognizable as human language is sounded. Only machines can create and recite the poem. It can be absolute liberation or total repression.</p>
<p>Fluxus veteran and avant-garde maverick Yasunao Tone took an anthology of 8th century Japanese poems and attempted to find their hidden meanings. His product has the qualities mentioned above. Tone scanned the Chinese characters on the Man'yoshu prints through a computer and played back the audible verses-- mining the raw data of sounds heard beneath the text. The words are completely lost. The result sounds like a video arcade heard through tinnitus-damaged ears, as his 2003 eponymous album attests. Yet, such mechanized art still retains a human touch-- the loose handwritings keep a loose rhythm in the chaos. The music is also very slapstick for stumbling across the digital static and misinformation, just like the glitches heard when Tone famously battered CDs for his 1997 landmark piece, <i>Solo For Wounded CD</i>. One memory to take to your grave could be five minutes of that performance-- the twittering and skittering of CD players gasping for air is pure malevolence.</p>
<p>On <i>Palimpsest</i>, Austrian laptop-noisenik Florian Hecker mutates Tone's ""Man'Yo"" pieces to decent results. He doesn't remix as much as magnifies every bit of data by 10,000x, uncovering microorganisms that dwell in the poem's fibers and ink. In the exhaustive and sometimes aimless 28-minute title track, he finds two voices in the noise, and divides them to each stereo channel; one muttering to itself while the other panics. Hecker's touch is familiar as his scrapes, pings, and crashes of white noise all flicker about like lawn gnats or a copy of Pac Man for the Atari 2600 dipped in Coca-Cola acid. He still keeps his funk, recalling his unforgettable ""BSF(0)Tyk 5"", where he had a Culture Club studio musician fall dead on his keytar.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Palimpsest</i> are various revisions of Tone's other ""Man'Yo"" excavations. They're mostly homogenous and bring little to the table. ""Man'Yo #3A~37 / 750A54 Zero Crossings [extended mix II]"" opens with what resembles the steel-drum roll of 50 Cent's ""P.I.M.P."" Hecker then adds free jazz-style interplay between the arguing voices, where one moment features a quick pause and then a scream for dear life. His five-minute edit is slightly superior for its brevity that keeps the most memorable moments in line. Closer ""4"" simply time-stretches a roto-router buzz that hovers like a ghetto bird searching an empty weed patch. It's quite poetic, actually.</p></div>"|8277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8277-palimpsest-with-hecker/|6.6|Cameron Macdonald

As a genre, ""Christmas music"" is near-dead and embarrassingly cheap: overwrought, gloppy anthologies litter Pottery Barn checkout counters, get tucked into cereal boxes, and pipe out endlessly from shitty, strip mall speakers, stuffing our list-wielding ears with tinny, impossibly canned sounds. Plenty of ""Classic Christmas"" anthologies are released and purchased every year (almost always with noble intentions), but if they manage to escape being blankly tossed post-holiday, they usually just end up crammed haphazardly into dented cardboard boxes, left to rub up against plush, sweater-sporting reindeer and dysfunctional strings of tiny white lights. They are accessories, disposable and meaningless, inherently temporary: They are far from sacred.</p><p>
<i>Where Will You Be Christmas Day?</i>, curated by ace musicologist Dick Spottswood (and based loosely on his Washington, D.C. radio show), is the latest release from Atlanta's fledgling Dust-to-Digital, the same label that produced the mind-blowing <i>Goodbye, Babylon</i> box late last year. And much like <i>Goodbye, Babylon</i>, this record will leave you wondering why the 1960s are the years everyone always gets so mournfully nostalgic for. Charming, challenging, and endlessly captivating, <i>Where Will You Be Christmas Day?</i> is the kind of quasi-seasonal anthology that you'll totally dig out in July, popsicles and all, suddenly craving (if not requiring) its quiet, unmatched grace.</p><p>
    
    Drawing heavily from early American folk, jazz, and blues (and incorporating classic holiday songs from the Ukraine, Italy, Trinidad, and Puerto Rico), the tracks included here date from 1917 to 1959, and represent an impressive spectrum of vocal styles, stretching from four-note sacred harp hooting to brash, mid-century gospel. Consequently, <i>Where Will You Be Christmas Day?</i> is compelling simply as an anthropological peek, a crackly glimpse at secular traditions-in-the-making-- but all Smithsonian-geekiness aside, the music itself is more than satisfying, loaded with plenty of fresh, regional glee. Delta-blues gurus Lightnin' Hopkins and Lead Belly each contribute tracks, as do The Alabama Sacred Harp Singers, Fiddlin' John Carson and His Virginia Reelers, Butterbeans and Susie, The Cotton Top Mountain Sanctified Singers, Los Jibaros, Kansas City Kitty, Bessie Smith, and 14 others-- even the tracklisting reads like poetry.</p><p>
    
    Most of these cuts are swimming in tape hiss, and if the songs aren't performed a capella, the instrumentation is modest at best. Still, what's lost via archaic microphones and questionable technology is more than made up for by a complete lack of post-production studio tweakery: voices are wild and occasionally off-key, swinging earnestly from note to note, shining in their full, one-take glory. Ultimately, what's most striking about this collection is how unapologetically warm, triumphant, and giggly the whole thing is: Unlike a lot of heavy, brooding Christmas songs (see the plodding gravity of ""Silent Night""), <i>Where Will You Be Christmas Day?</i> is defiantly plucky, far more concerned with celebration than meditation.</p><p>
    
    Despite Spottswood's liner-note pledge to mix the sacred and secular, the respectable and the rowdy, he seems to concentrate mainly on conveying each performer's joy, regardless of their affiliations. Opener ""The Last Month of Year"", howled a capella by Vera Hall Ward (and recorded in Tuscaloosa, Ala., in late 1959), is full of vocal cartwheels and semi-possessed yelps, emphatic and jubilant at the very same time. ""Holy Babe"", a rollicking collaboration between Kelly Pace, Aaron Brown, Joe Green, Paul Hayes, and Matthew Johnson, is a choral masterpiece, their raucous hoots and mmm-mmm's weaving together in unexpected accord. The Alabama Sacred Harp Singers roar through ""Sherburne"", while Butterbeans and Susie's ""Papa Ain't No Santa Claus (and Mama Ain't No Christmas Tree)"" is sublimely weird, all talking-blues and rhythmic caterwauling. There's plenty of humor to be found here, too-- Lord Beginner's ""Christmas Morning the Rum Had Me Yawning"" and Leroy Carr's ""Christmas in Jail - Ain't That a Pain"" are hilariously heartfelt in their earnest, bad-boy remorse.</p><p>
    
    So while <i>Where Will You Be Christmas Day?</i> is perfectly wonderful for tree-trimming and Charlie Brown-style dance-hopping, its true triumph is its uncanny longevity: It will last longer than your evergreen.</p></div>"|2040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2040-where-will-you-be-christmas-day/|8.3|Amanda Petrusich

Records. It was so immediately appealing that it quickly jumped out of the random promo slush pile and into my permanent collection. The band's technical prowess, singularity of vision, and potent songcraft (not to mention singer Joe Haege's accomplished vocal range) make it difficult to believe that they've garnered so little national acclaim. As the grassroots press network continues to ossify, it's easy to forget that there are good bands operating outside of the high-profile indie labels, and how exciting it is to stumble across one.</p><p>It's possible that 31 Knots will continue to dispatch their sleek, expansive compositions from the figurative wilderness, but as they search for stateside distribution for their new EP, <em>The Curse of the Longest Day</em>, I'll be shocked if one of the big indies doesn't snap it up. For now, it's available on Japanese label Stiff Slack Records (you'll find ordering information below). Even if their songs weren't so striking in and of themselves, this new EP finds 31 Knots positioning themselves for greater interest. It was mixed and mastered by Deerhoof's Greg Saunier and the band is preparing to tour Europe with Q and Not U, who-- shorn of their more spastic tendencies-- would be a feasible point of reference for 31 Knots.</p><p> The importance of 31 Knots's rhythm section, the two Jays (Pellicci and Winebrenner), shouldn't be underplayed: Their supple, delicately shifting armature is a vital component of the songs' impact. But the central figure in the band is Joe Haege, who's responsible for the lyrics, vocals, guitars, samples, and piano. It's Haege's voice that first draws you to 31 Knots-- it's a powerful instrument, evoking operatic singers from Jason Molina to Jeff Buckley to Craig Wedren. Haege forgoes the mealy-mouthed style of the day and sings from the diaphragm; his voice is resonant and clear as a bell.</p><p> The EP comprises four new songs and one untitled instrumental interlude. It opens with ""Welcome to Stop"", which stutters and coasts through woozy, heavily distorted slides; intense broadsides of staccato chords; and wiry runs of plinking guitar. Featuring Haege's most aggressive vocal performance and densest instrumentation, it's sharply contrasted by the EP's second (and strongest) track. ""The Corpse and the Carcass"" is a lean, minimally symphonic piece; the cinematic evocation of its succinct, reiterative synthetic-string-and-piano phrases instantly evoke the creeping micro-grandeur of Kronos Quartet's <em>Requiem for a Dream</em> soundtrack. While Haege's lyrics tend toward the ponderous and obscure, the music is sturdy enough to hold their weight, and here he pares them down to suit the leanness of the music: ""Who's the gospel, and who is the plain truth?/ Who's the misprint, and who is just slander?"" </p><p> The unlisted instrumental is a brief interlude of winnowing, coiled ambience in the center of the EP. ""The Story of Ivan Normal"" works through so many guitar modes over its gymnastic percussion-- wafting arpeggios, syncopated leads, poppy strumming, and clattering post-punk-- that it's remarkable it coheres into a catchy, hummable tune. And ""Coward With Claws"", a morass of rambling Shudder to Thinkisms pinioned with apocalyptic digital rumbles, closes an EP that presents a unity of vision with no discernible chinks. I'd say I expect great things from 31 Knots if I didn't feel that they've already accomplished them. Now it's just a matter of waiting for the word to spread.</p></div>"|8986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8986-the-curse-of-the-longest-day-ep/|8.0|Brian Howe

His songs draw listeners in despite his rough vocals, which he describes in the liner notes to <i>The Way I Were</i>, his new collection of early demos, as ""singing, bleating, whinging, and reed-like croaks."" But like Bob Dylan's, Johnston's voice, unpolished as it is, ultimately becomes part of the attraction: It gives his music an edge of actuality so that the songs seem to belong not to the province of studios and small-club tours, but to the real world of his listeners.</p><p>
    
    This contrast between crafted songs and strained vocals is what made <i>Can You Fly?</i> and <i>This Perfect World</i>, his two most well-known albums, so remarkable and made the tragically underrated <i>Never Home</i> jumpy and raw. But as Johnston's voice either matured or was smoothed over in a crossover attempt-- as on his most recent albums, <i>Blue Days Black Nights</i> and <i>Right Between the Promises</i>-- an essential component of the equation was lost.</p><p>
    
    So it's reassuring that Johnston has at this point in his career decided to release <i>The Way I Were</i>, whose 14 songs were recorded on a four-track betweeb 1986 to 1992. Not only does it serve as a reminder of what made him so compelling in the first place, but it also indicates that Johnston hasn't forgotten that he can turn his supposed weaknesses into strengths. Packed with songs that sound like they were made up on the spot, <i>The Way I Were</i> is Johnston's best release in years.</p><p>
    
    Part of the album's appeal is its endearing goofiness and why-the-hell-not spontaneity. As witty and imaginative as they are, even Johnston's best records aren't exactly jovial, but <i>The Way I Were</i> exhibits a keen sense of humor, from its Streisantic title to the cassette-tape artwork to the silliness of ""Happy Birthday"", in which Johnston duets with himself. On ""This Really Happened"", he recounts an eventful night at a bar called the Trouble Tree (which provided a name for his first album) and repeatedly interrupts himself to warble drunkenly, ""Long ago, and oh so far away!"" And ""The Enchanted Car"" would be a toss-off if not for its enchanted bass line and the cracked humor with which Johnston sings the phrase ""she's a canceled coupe.""</p><p>
    
    The album's basic recording technology complements this sense of fun, even as it adds gritty gravity to tracks like ""Light of Doubt"" and ""When the Cryin's Done"". In this four-track setting, Johnston pares his songs down to their essential elements; untouched by studio polish or professional solemnity, the songs sound direct and immediate. Even so, Johnston is still sonically adventurous: The tongue-in-cheek ""Love Songs About Girls"" has a flamenco flourish and ""I Can't Stop Shaking"" dices his vocals on its chorus.</p><p>
    
    Johnston works well within these confines, which were admittedly the result of circumstances rather than of a specific aesthetic approach. He recorded these songs in his early twenties, after he had moved from Lawrence, Kan., to New York City, but before he signed with Bar None and sold family farmland to pay for <i>Can You Fly?</i> and its tour-- as well as before he felt the fade-out of two poorly received albums. His youthful optimism comes across on every track: <i>The Way I Were</i> is a self-portrait of an artist with all the ups and downs of his career still ahead of him.</p></div>"|4289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4289-the-way-i-were/|7.7|Stephen M.

    However, three reinterpretations of songs from Marc Bianchi (Her Space Holiday)'s dream-pop/chamber-hop joint, <i>The Young Machines</i>, garner a new appreciation of the wounded bard who sleeps under his bed. Matmos revises our man's violin handiwork on ""Tech Romance"" as a lost Appalachian-folk tune, where a tinker-toy xylophone leads a ballad of weary guitars and syrup-leaking strings. Bianchi rambles like a stranger digging through your trash for soda cans at 2 a.m. in Nobody's vinyl-hissing dub treatment of ""From South Carolina"". And then Stereolab cruelly create a sitcom punch line for Bianchi's ""Girl Problem"". The band first plays peachy keen surf-rock crescendos as he sings, ""Here is the point where I fall apart/ For the second time."" Then comes the ""Munsters""-esque shindig, where he pouts, ""I've got a girl problem/ I've got a drug problem!"" But everything is resolved by a Burt Bacharach clone on the electronic ivories as our hero exhales, ""And I will always think of you as someone that I love.""</p><p>
    
    Bianchi generally writes bad poetry that's harvested from genuine feeling, as Oscar Wilde might have called it. He definitely earned his stripes, as so many critics awarded Bianchi's testicular chutzpah for speaking his soul. Yet the remixers mainly focus more on enhancing his runny-nosed but admirable synth instrumentation than bringing his lyrics to the fore. Not everything clicks: Dntel frolics on a beach in sunset to Easy Listening schmaltz as Bianchi gives a VD clinic lecture on ""Japanese Gum"". Most surprising is Blockhead's fingerprints on ""Meet the Pressure"". There, Bianchi originally whined about critics who dissed his music: ""Don't get me wrong I don't mind getting bad reviews...But there are others who just love to cross that line/ Hoping that their viciousness will boost traffic on their site."" Blockhead had the nerve to reduce those cries into an <i>instrumental</i> theme for a Mexican soap opera-- complete with taunting flutes, flamenco guitars, and senoritas sighing.</p><p>
    
    A more appropriate treatment is the Super Furry Animals' trip to Perrey-Kingsley country on ""Sleepy California"". It's a royal choice when Bianchi announces, ""I never thought I'd say this, but I miss my mom."" Elsewhere, Arab Strap imagines the post-breakup dirge ""Something To Do With My Hands"" as a new wave disco number for a mid-80's teen dramedy. Boom Bip marinates ""The Luxury of Loneliness"" with electro-funk dribbling and hypnotic guitar murmuring-- letting fresh air into the hermit's black-walled bedroom. However, Bianchi's motivational speech still hurts, as he whispers, ""I think that the worst part of it all is that you don't know how beautiful you are/ That isn't all right.""</p></div>"|3827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3827-the-young-machines-remixed/|6.8|Cameron Macdonald

    Opener ""Locks in Shadows"" is the EP's strongest track-- competent 60s sunshine pop similar to Saturday Looks Good to Me-- but still fails to be engaging; the song is a fleeting glimpse at one of the band's many costumes. ""Spectrum of Vapor"" is a droning, heroin-spiked pop number embellished with woozy synths and hushed sitar but it meanders, settling for relatively uninteresting druggy ambience over structure.</p><p>
    
    The title track evinces another sonic diversion, this time into downbeat Madchester territory with touches of atmospheric dream pop. The song doubles as a soundtrack to the group's video project-- which consists of stark, picturesque scenes of plant life digitally mirrored to a vaguely hypnotic, kaleidoscopic effect-- but isn't remarkable on its own. An untitled track is similarly modest; the group's warmed-over Depeche Mode posturing is yet another deliberate and seemingly random image transformation. But again, the music feels primarily conceptual, and in practice fails to expand or challenge a conventional pop formula.</p><p>
    
    For a group with such lofty artistic aspirations, L-D's <i> A Sectioned Beam</i> feels largely tossed off and half-hearted. The long-running debate about the band's sincerity and artistic intent is a non-issue here, as the final product is undistinguished enough to make larger questions immaterial. L-D may theoretically challenge the traditional boundaries of pop music but in this case, mediocre material overshadows any greater collective vision. L-D's image and style is deliberately all over the map, but without strong songs the band's malleability and experimentation doesn't make for satisfying pop-- like the accompanying video, the music on <i> A Sectioned Beam</i> is all smoke and mirrors, occasionally pretty but largely forgettable.</p></div>"|4965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4965-a-sectioned-beam/|5.4|David Moore

Last winter, while browsing in a record store, I came across a compilation of shoegazer tracks, sitting there with all the finality of a collection of 60s garage. All of these bands with their echoes and their noise-- even Blind Mr. Jones! A few racks over-- you know, by the deluxe anniversary editions of Pavement records-- I got shaky. Is this what we're doing now: Packing up the 90s for posterity? And why should finality be a grave? Some reappraisal is necessary, and when it comes to those shoegazers, that goes double. As popular as the whole scene was, too many people have spent too many years saying nothing more interesting about these bands than that they weren't quite as good as My Bloody Valentine. And of all the bands that were stuck with that claim, Slowdive is the one for whom it was the most damnably untrue.</p><p>
    
    These days we all know that, in the end, Slowdive were hardly shoegazers at all. That didn't stop them from recording some of the classics of the genre, but still: There's something in this work-- from the earliest singles to the beyond-rock of their last album-- that's just singularly theirs, something that's made them as influential to today's electronic music artists (or, hell, to goths) as they have been for rock kids. Listening to <i>Catch the Breeze</i>-- which comfortably abridges a three-album career onto two discs-- you get an immediate sense of why. Frontman Neil Halstead's songs have a narcotic languor to them, a quality that makes them sound like he's constantly on the verge of drifting off. But there's something about the deliberate haze of this stuff-- the layers of echoing guitar they wrap songs in, the way the vocals emerge as distant angel moans-- that gives every word and chord a massive intensity. It's like watching film in slow motion: Everything goes watery-dreamy, but it also takes on a weight and a drama that can crush. And through every stage of their career, that's the heart of Slowdive. You're lulled into sleepy waves of melody, the hazy druggy beauty of it all, but just as you're drifting away, the whole thing squalls up into a big crushing storm or drops off into disorienting darkness. People try it with guitars and they try it with computers, and nobody does it quite like this.</p><p>
    
    So three albums, two discs. The draw for longtime fans is a selection of tracks from the band's earliest singles. This was as close as they came to sounding like a conventional rock band-- albeit a huge, deep, and sleepy one, with Halstead and Rachel Goswell already crooning with lazy grace. By my count there are eight tracks here that aren't available on the band's three albums (assuming you have the expanded U.S. version of <i>Souvlaki</i>), including a Peel Session cover of Syd Barrett's ""Golden Hair""-- convenient enough if you don't feel like hunting down 12-inches. The band's first LP, <i>Just for a Day</i>, is underrepresented here, most likely due to its occasionally fluffy, over-prettified production; instead, things leap straight on to the band's two classics, starting with 1993's <i>Souvlaki</i>. Owners of that U.S. edition will find 10 of its tracks included here, and with good reason. This album is, dare I say, every bit as good as <i>Loveless</i>, and just as singular. What's amazing about it is the way Halstead's exquisite pop songwriting comes so strongly to the forefront of the band's sound-- and meshes, magically, with an even greater sonic ambition. The result is the reason critics started calling things ""dream-pop,"" and the best songs here-- ""Alison"" and ""40 Days""-- sound exactly like that: gorgeous traditional pop songs heard in blurry, dreamlike slow motion, sleepy and crushing at the same time. Even more ambitious are the tracks that stemmed from the band's collaboration with Brian Eno-- songs like ""Sing"" and ""Souvlaki Space Station"", which wash out into dubby groove and echo, with vocals pushed back into the role of instruments.</p><p>
    
    Two years later, the band released something else entirely-- a collection of songs recorded mostly by Halstead, with a sound that left the rock-band format behind altogether. The past few years have seen a huge revival of interest in this kind of thing: The ""lost generation"" of bands-- Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, Seefeel-- for whom Simon Reynolds coined the term ""post-rock."" It's in those terms that Slowdive's last album, <i>Pygmalion</i>, has come to seem like the best thing Halstead has been involved with. The highlight, ""Blue Skied an' Clear"", is worth the price of any collection anyone sticks it on: It's one of the most achingly pretty things you'll ever hear, milking incredible pathos from a shuffling drum loop, sparkling touches of guitar, and a chorus of ghostly half-moaning vocals. ""Crazy for You"" goes even further, constructing another rush of sound and then building it up and breaking it down like dance music. <i>Catch the Breeze</i> nicks a full five songs from <i>Pygmalion</i>, an album only nine tracks long-- and for Americans, it's more than worth it: This LP can be criminally hard to find.</p><p>
    
    And that's Slowdive, in a handy two-disc set, packed and packaged. There's a scent of finality about it. This, in most cases, will be all the Slowdive anyone needs. There's a quintessential Slowdive-listening experience: You lie in bed letting those waves of sound wash over you; you drift comfortably off into dreamworld, thinking of big pretty oceans; and then you wake up, minutes later, to find a big disorienting blur shooting out of your speakers-- so massive, so intensively vivid, or so dark and ominous, that you wonder how you could sleep to this at all. It's like taking a sleeping pill and waking up to find yourself frighteningly, alarmingly drugged-- an experience I wish, fondly, on everyone who brings this collection home.</p></div>"|7791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7791-catch-the-breeze/|9.5|Nitsuh Abebe

Despite the obvious nods to The Pastels or Belle &amp; Sebastian, that's never been true-- even if you don't have enough patience for Australia's The Lucksmiths. For one thing, forebears like Felt and The Field Mice hailed from England, not Scotland. For another, albums like Fan Modine's <em>Homeland</em> provide a sparkling reminder of the winsome pop gems in American listeners' backyards.</p><p>
    
    On this sophomore effort, Fan Modine mastermind Gordon Zacharias draws from the elegance of early Magnetic Fields and the groove-based intimacy of The Folk Implosion more than, say, Beat Happening, the original exception to the Scotophiliac rule. But where <em>69 Love Songs</em> often focused on love's ironies (""Love Is Like a Bottle of Gin""), <em>Homeland</em> is an unabashed paean to its peaks. While <em>One Part Lullaby</em> explored Lou Barlow's alienation after moving across the country (""E.Z.L.A.""), Fan Modine's latest, as its title implies, is about that elusive, invaluable feeling of ""home.""</p><p>
    
    The album's centerpiece is ""Pageantry"", which pits a hushed, theatrical vocal against burbling Her Space Holiday-esque orchestration. ""Pageantry walks through the door,"" Zacharias exults at his most Stephin Merritt-like, ""and I keep repeating track number four."" Originally released as a seven-inch in 1999, ""Pageantry"" has been a long time coming to CD-- although it didn't really need to be slotted at track four, did it? Save that for the many hopeful mixtapes this song is sure to grace.</p><p>
    
    The previous song, ""We Are All Decades"", is the one most explicitly influenced by Lou Barlow's extra-Sebadoh noodlings. The prominent bass line and Barlow-esque, double-tracked vocal wouldn't have been out of place alongside Folk Implosion breakthrough ""Natural One"" on the <em>Kids</em> soundtrack, though some subtle vocoder adds a new twist. The lyrics might fit an elliptical collaboration between Sentridoh and Cole Porter: ""The more you placate everybody/ The less you can escape the world/ Act tall to the street vendor.""</p><p>
<em>Homeland</em> is arguably less ambitious than Fan Modine's debut, the self-released 1998 concept album <em>Slow Road to Tiny Empire</em>. But improved confidence and recording quality shore up a batch of songs that find beauty in the familiar as much as the abstract. Zacharias lent his elegant voice to this year's charming debut by orchestral pop duo Hercules, who return the favor with string arrangements and co-production duties on four songs here. Wordier than Zacharias' Hercules outings, these tunes expand on the violin-soaked palette of ""Pageantry"", awash in pleasant decadence. Opening with modest acoustic guitar strums, first track ""Newsstand of the Sun"" blossoms into a Mancini-esque discovery of romance. If not for further Merritt-esque lyrics about dandies, Bentleys and lion cages, ""Waiting in the Wings"" could fit on Hercules' <em>In the Alleyway</em>-- here, the song plays like an adaptation of the Henry James story <em>The Beast in the Jungle</em>, with worldly riches rather than overweening egoism preventing this John Marcher from finding ""one true love.""</p><p>
    
    Though <em>Homeland</em>'s theme emerges early on, a Hercules collaboration cements it. Amid the bouncy tin pan alley of ""Throughout Your Life"", Zacharias masterfully toes the line between fine gruyere and common EZ Cheez. ""There's nothing quite like knowing where you belong,"" he sings, asking a lover to marry him with heartbreaking earnestness you won't find on the new Jimmy Eat World album. For now, Zacharias apparently belongs in Carrboro, N.C., where he has put together a new quintet incarnation of Fan Modine including former members of Jets to Brazil, Polvo, and Idyll Swords. Good pop belongs wherever you hear it-- thanks, Scotland, but occasionally we Yanks get it right.</p></div>"|3331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3331-homeland/|8.0|Marc Hogan

That <i>The Pretty Toney Album</i> has criminally underperformed seems to defeat the commercial mandate for an outtakes collection, but the bevy of surplus material is surprisingly consistent; Ghostface's first entry under the Theodore Unit moniker serves as a nice, if unnecessary, accessory to its criminally unsuccessful counterpart.</p><p>
<i>718</i> compiles recent mixtape tracks that didn't make the cut for <i>Pretty Toney</i> and a handful of previously unreleased odds and ends. But the continuity, strength of production, and sharpness of the record's guest lineup suggests a good deal of forethought. A track like ""Guerilla Hood"", for instance, which would have sat favorably in the <i>Pretty Toney</i> tracklist, was probably reserved with a side project in mind.</p><p>
    
    ""Punch In Punch Out"" is a fairly straightforward battle-rhyme-cum-testament to black market business operations. Pejoratives like Trife's: ""You's a has-been/ Always will, always have been/ That garbage you pumpin'/ You need to save it for the trash bin,"" roam over a brooding beat underpinned by a single sustained synth note. ""88 Freestyle"" features some nimble verses but the song is sullied by a particularly garish sample: A wailing, vaguely Middle Eastern guitar bend that feels awkwardly wedged in.</p><p>
    
    Lest we forget this isn't a Ghostface solo effort, ""The Drummer"" brings a cast to make Ocean's Eleven soil its pants. On previous outings, such generosity has been an invitation to unwelcome distractions, but here the MCs' interplay is arch, transitioning quickly from voice to voice over a breathy, crackling beat. Even Method Man drops in for a droopy verse.</p><p>
    
    Despite this being a decidedly populist affair, the tawdry, blaxploitation production and the tic-addled vehemence of Ghostface's verses are intact. But beyond its reliably scruffy sound, the sampling on <i>718</i> is-- with a few catchy, well-placed exceptions-- chintzy. ""Mama Can You Hear Me"" thrives off the nervous trills of an overwrought orch-pop ballad, while ""Smith Brothers"" uses a stinging string line and cops Queen in its bawdy chorus: A serpentine verse fit to a familiar cadence before the telltale, ""Tell 'em, 'We will, we will rock you...pop you.'"" Such witticisms pervade the album but, on the whole, 718 is more introspective than previous Ghostface releases. Whereas in the past Ghostface has been preoccupied with gregarious, almost parodically violent lyrics, <i>718</i>'s ""Mama Can You Hear Me"" and ""Who Are We"" show a touching vulnerability. On the former, Solomon Childs levels charged laments (""This the projects/ Summertime ain't comin'"") in a huge baritone swollen with echo.</p><p>
    
    Of course, amid this panoply of competent lyricists, Ghostface still shines. But his closest competitor remains Trife, whose verses, delivered in a thick, cocky cadence that sounds naturally double tracked, are among <i>718</i>'s finest. It's hard to imagine why Trife doesn't yet have a solo album to his credit, but his spots on <i>Supreme Clientele</i>, <i>Pretty Toney</i>, and now <i>718</i> have given him a fantastic endorsement.</p><p>
    
    Though undoubtedly strong, <i>718</i> is a pale stand-in for a proper Ghostface full-length. That's because it's a different record, more varied, more scattershot. Even so, Ghostface chose the right men to surround himself with. Commercially feasible or not, <i>718</i> features enough stylish production and idiosyncratic rapping to service Ghostface's reputation while providing the Theodore Unit stable with a cornerstone for its own.</p></div>"|8276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8276-718/|7.0|Sam Ubl

There's an arrogance to it but at the same time, it's just about the least creative, least clever name you could give to a band-- especially since we've already had The Band and The The. If you're going to adopt the generic term for your chosen art form as your band's moniker you had damn well better make music that flattens the earth, because if you don't you will be easily forgotten. And those who are interested won't even be able to find you on the Internet because your handle brings up more than a million results.</p><p>
    
    Two albums in, I am not convinced that The Music will ever be a band that can transcend their stupid name. Their eponymous first album at least dabbled in eclecticism and flirted with dance rhythms and electronic textures alongside their big 70s rock riffs rock, but <i>Welcome to the North</i> actually narrows the band's scope, morphing the Leeds quartet into a nu-Zeppelin pop Dream Theater with a vocalist that sounds a lot like Geddy Lee or a cartoon or maybe a cartoon of Geddy Lee. In a way, The Music are lot like Oasis, in that everything they do is <i>huge</i>, but none of what they do is original at all. In a pinch, you could accurately describe them as a denser Red Rider.</p><p>
    
    Clearly, the band believes that working in nothing but sweeping gestures and keeping subtlety at arm's length is the quickest route to changing lives one stadium full of them at a time. There's a possibility that they're correct: The mountain-crushing riff that tears up the opening of ""Freedom Fighters"" certainly kicks adequate ass, but when they let you listen to this stuff for an hour, it's pretty clear that this band has nothing to say outside of platitudes and only a couple of ways to say it. Over the course of both ballads and rockers, the album is utterly monochromatic, and I can't understand how such basic hard rock can sound so dreadfully awful on headphones-- the production, courtesy of Brendan O'Brien, is hopelessly cluttered and flat given the relatively basic setup.</p><p>
    
    Guitarist Adam Nutter must have about 60 effects boxes to trip over in the studio, but were he restricted to some vacuum tube distortion and reverb he'd be three times as powerful as he is here with his overly digital, grayed-out tone. The best thing about this band is drummer Phil Jordan, whose shuffling, propulsive beats and auxiliary percussion additions save essentially every song from potential complete collapse. He's all that redeems the awful ballad ""Bleed From Within"", which begins as a limp U2 homage with lyrics like ""The sun is bleeding into mine eye"" and ""When darkness falls there will be war/ I'm bleeding/ Yeah, I'm bleeding from within."" The chorus, whose sole word is ""burn"" repeated over and over again is reasonably buoyant, but this song goes nowhere until Jordan's beat takes center stage and the rest of the band just hangs on for the ride. Vocalist Robert Harvey tries his best to ruin it with inexplicably horrendous wordless vocalizations but on an album where the band flails for gripping moments, you take what you can get.</p><p>
    
    As much as they try to break your heart and lift your downtrodden spirit, The Music really aren't up to the task, and it's a wide open question as to whether they ever will be. They have general technical proficiency and a knack for a good riff, but listening to them is nevertheless a chore-- and a boring, repetitive one at that.</p></div>"|5523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5523-welcome-to-the-north/|5.0|Joe Tangari

No, really, you've heard all of this before, but that's because it's true. Mark E. Smith's revolving door doesn't always push out masterpieces but the music is rarely less than fascinating, and the band's rigorously applied aesthetic blueprint nullifies the fatigue of their prolific tendencies. Their imperfection and profligate recording habits are part of what makes them one of my favorite bands, but with <i>Interim</i> the shit has finally hit the fan. I know MES can be somewhat cavalier regarding his fans and their expectations, but no one that I know of needs a disc like this.</p><p>
<i>Interim</i>-- aptly named as its sole purpose seems to be as space filler between proper LPs-- is a haphazard jumble of recent rehearsals and live recordings, with mastering levels randomly ranging from inaudible to deafening, fidelity that is consistently questionable but often awful, and a bizarre tracklisting that throws in a few new songs that are illicitly available on superior Peel Session bootlegs (and likely soon on a new Fall album), mock-ups of the tracks from <i>The Real New Fall LP</i>, and a few live recordings of old classics from the band's current lineup. In other words, no one really seems to have given much thought to this disc's actual value or purpose to fans, and it further muddies The Fall's already confusing and (to a newcomer) somewhat monolithic discography.</p><p>
    
    And dammit, what makes this even more frustrating is that most of the material is quite good-- maybe not prime Fall, but strong. Really, I just got versions of ""Mod Mock Goth"", ""Theme From Sparta FC"", and ""Boxoctosis"" earlier this year, and those were better than these, and I like the rearrangement on the live take on <i>This Nation's Saving Grace</i>'s fantastic ""Spoilt Victorian Child"", but the sound is terrible, with volume fluctuations and a disengaged vocal from MES sinks it further. Couldn't I just have a whole show with the current lineup? The new songs are often impressive, but why not just treat me to the whole Peel Session? Instead, ""Blindness"", (aka ""Blind Man""-- most of the songs here have slightly altered or adjusted titles) is just a nasty bassline and you're left trying to glean the rest of it through the fuzzy mud. ""All Clasp Hands"" sounds recorded by an audience member, and the crowd noise is irritating, though not quite as irritating as the odd and nearly constant clapping that sabotages ""What About Us?"" Why does the promising ""I'm Ronney the Oney"" cut off suddenly after a minute and a half?</p><p>
    
    And what the hell is that beeping sound in the middle of ""Boxoctosis Alarum"" (again with the needlessly altered titles)? It comes in like someone's pager going off in the midst of a movie, and it's louder than anything else on the recording. Seriously, this is either a post-modernist experimental joke to see how many critics will call it genius or it's just plain sloppy and careless. I say all of this with considerable conflict, because I love The Fall and normally find their erratic inscrutability a part of their allure. The songs themselves are guilty of nothing, good as they are, but the presentation is all wrong. Fall cultists, beware, because the completist in you who forces you to buy this is laying an ambush. Non-cultists, don't even contemplate laying out a red cent for this. Get <i>The Real New Fall LP</i>. Get on the peer-to-peers and find the Peel Sessions, wait for a real live album and wait for the next LP, because this is not worth your time.</p></div>"|2977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2977-interim/|5.8|Joe Tangari

As Woven Hand, Edwards has yet to miss a beat. Though it's still framed as a ""side project,"" with <i>Consider the Birds</i>, his third and strongest solo effort, Edwards achieves a passionate pitch that eternally eclipses his output with his proper band, 16 Horsepower.</p>
<p>Begeting a monumental sound hinted at on past efforts, these 10 tracks are denser and more layered than the ethereal path walked by last year's beautiful <i>Blush Music</i>, a record that more and more reminds me of a cracked and icy music box left to disintegrate back into the damp earth. On <i>Consider the Birds</i>, as though concocted with quicksand, new sounds escape from each composition over subsequent listens-- little last gasps from a toy piano show up here, a last-minute snare hit there. The works are pocked with these shadowed corners: the dark, oaken sounds of barn-raising banjo, upright bass, and guitar as well as cymbal crashes, cattail taps, possessed howls, and the faint flapping of lark wings. The elegant piano that shuffles beneath ""Speaking Hands"" is time again punctuated by crackling, splintery percussion. ""Down In The Forest"" rings ominously with bells of paradise.</p>
<p>Its title referencing the Biblical passage about God providing for our feathered friends, <i>Consider the Birds</i> is a compelling cycle of blistering sermons, spare near-spoken ballads, and seesaw tales of faith and earthly toil. Aesthetically, it drifts alongside the Bonnie Prince and the Bad Seed in a starless tar-black stream. But world-weary Edwards is singular is his sustained scowl: Will Oldham saw a darkness then managed to chase that tear-in-his-beer with creaky back-porch jests; Nick Cave has kept an upside-down smile in place longer, but peppers the pulpit with insinuation and romance.</p>
<p>Yes, Edwards' religiosity is hardcore to say the least, and his Old Testament God seems unforgiving and even violent (e.g. ""The world will bow/ The knees will be broken for those who don't know how""). In the swampy gypsy bayou of ""To Make A Ring"" Edwards beseeches nonbelievers to realize that ""judgment is not avoided by your unbelief/ Your lack of fear/ Nor by your prayers to any little idol here...The lord will not be mocked/ Not by you or me."" Gathering a gale force, the track ends with a hermetic sing-a-long around a burning maypole: ""We will weave our voice, we will weave our voice together and sing forever round the throne."" So, if like me you don't believe in God, then why listen? Well, because unlike empty teen angst or bitchy navel gazing, Edwards has a certified message and even with the spikes and thorns and judgments his work emerges from a compelling, otherworldly mindset.</p>
<p>As our country turns further towards the conservative right, it makes sense to some to be suspicious of religiosity but from my atheistic vantage, <i>Consider the Birds</i> is pleasingly scabrous and utterly apocalyptic. Instead of peppering his work with brief/sappy/peachy references, Edwards unleashes a torrent. Accordingly, religion aside, <i>Consider the Birds</i> should please any and all fans of bleak testimonials and Valley-of-Darkness soundscapes. If you really do fear Godly cooties, block out Edwards lyrics (pretend he's speaking in undecipherable tongues or talking to his girlfriend) and instead take a walk along brittle pine needles with these dark melodies, virtuosic screeches, and that humid overbearingness of his stately vocalizations.</p></div>"|8761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8761-consider-the-birds/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

Fewer than 500,000 copies sold? Hell, <i>Von</i> initially printed less than 500. A shining example of sacrosanct iconoclasm? Truly. Kitschy and tongue-in-cheek enough to win over Jack Black (who this year championed Eagles of Death Metal as his sole nomination)? Well, they're Icelandic.</p><p>
    
    Around the release of <i>Agaetis Byrjun</i>, Sigur Ros promised to ""change music...and the way people think about music"" forever. Whereas on that record-- nestled cozily inside a fully realized voice-- they sounded up to the task, <i>Von</i> is weighted down by the band's bodacious ambition. At 72 minutes, the album is bloated with ideas Sigur Ros would refine on their sophomore outing. As such, it's an exciting look back at a once-mysterious group who leaped from obscurity to mug the mainstream. Young, earnest, eerie, and overzealous, <i>Von</i> is a unique, almost belligerently unaffiliated piece of music that unsubtly blazons its idiosyncrasies.</p><p>
    
    Naturally, <i>Von</i> kicks off with a bold mission statement: ""Sigur Ros"", which is purposefully stagnant and entirely too long. At more than nine minutes in length, the track is an ambient impasse, a slow-moving mass of nothing much. Imagine the nebulous prelude of <i>Agaetis Byrjun</i> opener ""Intro"" stretched to 10 times its original length and without a tension-breaker like ""Sven-G-Englar"" to empty into. ""Dogun"" prolongs the shapelessness, though in a slightly more affable fashion: The song features the sort of ethereal, reverb-laden choral intonations that tread the fenceline between blissed-out psych and Enya-style therapop. But the voices are eventually fed through a voicebox and garbled beyond recognition, establishing Sigur Ros on the edgier side of the divide.</p><p>
    
    Things don't really get off the ground until ""Hun Jord"". Centered around a harrowing vocal refrain, the song paints with darker hues than Sigur Ros' newer material, but still bears the band's unmistakable emblem. Tape splices chatter through the opening section before a sludgy guitar and martial drums enter to pilot the fracas. Uncharacteristically, one can actually hear a well-defined set of reference points here, including Mogwai, Hawkwind, and Spacemen 3.</p><p>
    
    For the most part, however, <i>Von</i> is very distant from its time. Even in its most conventional moments, <i>Von</i> sounds utterly unlike anything from the period, and is only tentatively allusive of the band's fecund latter-day output. ""Myrkur"", though redolent of Pink Floyd and Hum, is happily and naively detached. Much like <i>Agaetis Byrjun</i>, <i>Von</i> thrives on a certain amount of landscaping-- wandering the Icelandic countryside is a surreal and uncanny experience, one that Sigur Ros convey beautifully. But in sounding so consciously epic, the album comes across more self-aware-- and thus less powerful-- than its offspring. Rather, it's a rugged, cave-dwelling cousin to <i>Agaetis Byrjun</i>'s stargazing hopefulness and environmentalism.</p></div>"|7154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7154-von/|7.8|Sam Ubl

Since the release of that landmark album, the members of the loose-knit troupe have branched out and done their share to expand the sonic parameters of the enlightened American underground.</p><p>
    
    In the past couple of years, Pat (P.G. Six) Gubler, Samara Lubelski, and Dean Roberts all released noteworthy solo albums, as well as recordings with other various outfits such as Autistic Daughters and Hall of Fame. Tim Barnes has played with Neil Haggerty, made a cameo on Wilco's <i>A Ghost is Born</i>, and operated his adventurous Quakebasket label, among other projects. Perhaps busiest of all has been Matt (MV) Valentine, who presides over the astonishing Child of Microtones CD-R empire through which he's unleashed a deluge of recordings both solo and in duet with Erika (EE) Elder. All of this activity has understandably helped foster curiosity about the work of the full Tower Recordings ensemble, so now Barnes and Valentine have gone back through their old tapes and compiled this new collection of <i>Folk Scene</i>-era material.</p><p>
    
    A veritable rogues' gallery of instrumental talent, the Tower Recordings of that era were conversant in a remarkable array of progressive folk dialects, and their resulting sound was a motley pastiche of gentle acoustic balladry, the psychedelic exoticisms of the Incredible String Band or Comus, and feral ESP-derived pagan thud. And though it contains many passages of exhilarating beauty, <i>Folk Scene</i> remains an odd record by any measuring stick; its oddity accentuated by short song lengths (most of its 22 tracks are under 2 minutes long) and wild mood shifts that can at times make it a jarring, difficult listen.</p><p>
    
    This problem has been rectified on <i>Galaxies' Incredible Sensual Transmission Field</i>. (Apparently, the group has been taking album-titling advice from Acid Mothers Temple.) Recorded in a church in upstate New York, the group here sounds loose and live, and the extended running time of these six tracks allows the group to open all of its sails and draw some serious steam. ""Harvester"" opens the album with a shambling chug, as a mysterious heap of guitar strings and scraping fiddle bows eventually collapses and permits steadfast columns of clackety percussion to carry the day. Though it takes a couple of minutes to get up to full fire, once everybody is onboard this track neatly anticipates avenues that would eventually be explored further by Sunburned Hand of the Man. ""Empress of I-91"" brings in more jingle bells, handclaps, horns (recorders, maybe?), and a graspable melody, sounding like what the residents of the <i>Wicker Man</i> island may have enjoyed. (Although, unfortunately, Britt Eckland is nowhere to be seen.)</p><p>
    
    Throughout these songs the only constant is change. Every time a piece risks growing stale through repetition someone in the room introduces a brand new element of sound-- a tinny piano, a distorted harmonica, a taped snatch of drone. And though this technique ensures a continuous succession of surprises, it also means the listener must endure the occasional patch of uninspired chaos as the band patiently pursues the next magical and elusive moment of cohesion. Thankfully, <i>Galaxies' Incredible Blah Blah </i> also succeeds in capturing so many of those moments that you'll likely find yourself hoping there will soon come a time when all of these talented individuals can once again assemble together under one banner.</p></div>"|8275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8275-galaxies-incredible-sensual-transmission-field-of-the-tower-recordings/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

They're from a small town in eastern Tennessee; three of them are brothers and the fourth is a cousin; the brothers are minister's kids; all four were home-schooled. All of which marks them as outsiders-- people untouched by industry politics or expectations who are just playing rock'n'roll 'cause they're livin' it, man! But Kings of Leon's insistence on their own honest naturalism-- from their time-capsule haircuts to Caleb Followill's overexpressive vocals to their terrible album titles-- seems disingenuous, especially in a genre (Southern rock) that prizes realness and grumbles at pretensions. The Followill clan wouldn't last a week in The Drive-By Truckers' Dirty South.</p><p>
<i>Aha Shake Heartbreak</i>, the follow-up to last year's bewilderingly well-received <i>Youth and Young Manhood</i>, is an update on the previous album's Southern bar-band rock, with just enough <i>Nuggets</i>-style pop chops to impress hipsters and critics. If the hooks aren't as good this time, the songs are more sculpted and succinct, with a greater sense of urgency and economy. On the other hand, these dozen tracks don't really mean anything. Sure, they're about stuff like women and being in a band, but they sound deeply impersonal, and often obligatory in their lazy misogyny (""Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make up"") and lazier obtuseness (""He's so the purity, the shaven and the mourning""-- even Beck is more coherent). Caleb sings about a girl with an ""hourglass body"" who ""has problems with drinking milk and being school tardy/ She'll loan you her toothbrush/ She'll bartend your party,"" but it doesn't sound like he actually knows anyone like that. Instead, the song's about a rock'n'roll archetype-- the wild heartbreaker, the man-eater, the endearing groupie-- and it never manages to transcend the blandly conceptual.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the lyrics are so self-referential they're almost narcissistic. Songs like ""Slow Night, So Long"" and ""Four Kicks"" are about what hard-livin' good ol' boys the Followills are. In particular, ""Soft"" is stupid sex wordplay that would be insulting if it weren't so self-deprecating: ""I'm passed out in your garden...I'd pop myself in your body/ I'd come into your party but I'm soft."" One word: eww. Another favorite topic is the harsh realities of endless touring and low-level fame, as if having a major-label promote you and Dave Eggers worship you in print are such hardships. But on ""Day Old Blues"" Caleb observes that ""Girls are gonna love the way I toss my hair/ Boy are going to hate the way I seem."" This boy in particular thinks that's the key to what makes this band such a bunch of fakes: They're more interested in appearances than in their music. Those haircuts don't appear anywhere in nature.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, maybe it's just the way Caleb sings that and every other line on <i>Aha Shake Heartbreak</i>. He is a terrible singer, like a drunken Randy Newman with Tourette's-- which would be a compliment if it didn't make you expect more intelligent lyrics. On just about every song here he lets loose a flurry of words in some bizarre approximation of backwater sass, but it just sounds willful and grating. On ""Day Old Blues"", he turns some lyrics into almost scat-like utterances while painfully overenunciating others. He's shooting for some sort of Southern-slash-Appalachian accent, but ultimately he defies geography and just sounds unnatural.</p><p>
    
    The album's one redeeming element is the band itself, who-- over the course of one EP and two albums-- have improved tenfold. They're tighter, more dynamic, and much more confident on <i>Aha Shake Heartbreak</i> than they were on <i>Youth and Young Manhood</i>. Granted, they still sound like they're descended from The Strokes and other garage bands rather than from southern royalty like Lynyrd Skynyrd or even Southern pop like The Gants or The Scruffs. Their boogie may have crawled out of Williamsburg instead of some backwater swamp, but Nathan, Jared, and Matthew Followill manage to incorporate vintage elements into their music without sounding overly nostalgic (which is the pitfall of soundalikes Thee Shams). ""Slow Night, So Long"" finds a twist ending in a slow coda, and songs like ""The Bucket"" and ""Razz"" pop and bounce elastically. With its hand-claps and staccato guitars, ""Taper Jean Girl"" struts such undeniable bad-ass energy that you may find yourself singing along, although you'll want to make up your own words.</p></div>"|4560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4560-aha-shake-heartbreak/|4.9|Stephen M.

His resistance to     digital music has been well-documented, and until recently, several of his releases-- including 1974's classic <i>On the Beach</i>--     had never been made available on compact disc.  So one can imagine him in an A&amp;R; office upstairs at Reprise Records, year after year, continually shooting down the concept of a compilation that attempts to condense his entire history onto a single disc.  He's already been compiled once anyway-- with the 1977 3xLP retrospective <i>Decade</i>.</p>
<p>Regardless, we're now being offered <i>Greatest Hits</i>, although Young does seems begrudging: Its only liner notes are the obligatory song credits and one line from Young himself that simply states, ""Greatest hits inclusion based on original record sales, airplay, and known download history.""  These criteria are not only anathema to his aesthetic (since when does the man behind ""This Note's For You"" care about airplay?), but here they comprise a collection that only skims the surface of his catalog: The tracklist features 16 songs from his 35-year career, ranging from 1969's ""Down by the River"" to 1991's ""Harvest Moon"".</p>
<p>Young's stubborn integrity extends beyond his politics-- which inform all of his songs, but only define a few like ""Ohio"" and ""Rockin' in the Free World""-- and saturates his music.  His catalog is riddled with sharp contrasts and sly contradictions, not least of which is the fact that this bearish-looking man sings with such a fragile falsetto.  More crucially, Young moves from ragged guitar epics to jangly country ballads with impressive agility.  He's also not one to rein in his songs, so they may often run for only two intense minutes (""The Needle and the Damage Done"") or sprawl to upwards of nine (""Down by the River"", ""Cowgirl in the Sand"").</p>
<p>These extremes make for a strange and strangely compelling <i>Greatest Hits</i>. Conceptually, it shouldn't work: Young has played many roles over five decades, but indeed, he's never been a singles artist.  In fact, he has only a passing acquaintance with the pop singles chart-- ""Heart of Gold"" went to #1, but he's had only two other solo top 40 singles-- and many of his most popular songs run much longer than the typical single's three minutes.</p>
<p>The disc begins, perversely and brilliantly, with the one-two punch of ""Down By the River"" and ""Cowgirl in the Sand"", which together total almost 20 minutes.  This seems less an act of rebellion than a simple stroke of luck, as the compilation is sequenced chronologically.  Even so, the songs illustrate clearly that Young and the hits format aren't exactly perfect for each other,     while still constituting an impressive introduction for newcomers.  Which is precisely what this record is designed to do.</p>
<p><i>Greatest Hits</i> is obviously intended mostly for curious initiates or casual listeners (although the remastered tracks will likely attract hardcore Young fans, too), and it achieves its goals sufficiently.  Those unacquainted with his work will learn that Young was a tremendous guitar player who gave himself ample room to range; that Crazy Horse understood the need to provide a good backdrop for his solos and knew how to churn a drag-the-river momentum; that Young was an able songwriter who could craft a killer line like ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" clincher ""every junkie's like a setting sun."" What they won't learn is the difference between Young's work with Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash: All 16 tracks are presented as Young's solo work, which is misleading.  Historical liner notes could have cleared this up and even introduced Young's collaborators.  Instead, the package leaves it to listeners to infer these distinctions from the song credits.</p>
<p>Fittingly, <i>Greatest Hits</i> skews to Young's early material: Eleven of these tracks represent his 1969-71 output, and only two songs postdate the 1970s (and, therefore, the still-in-print, two-disc <i>Decade</i>).  The implication is that Young more or less faded away, and that his first few albums far outshine his subsequent material.  But such a view is surely reductive: Young has not only been actively releasing albums throughout the 90s and into the 00s, but several of them been unexpectedly solid as well.  The sadly missed ""Cortez the Killer"" and ""Tonight's the Night"" are the set's most obvious exclusions, but the dismissal of late-era tracks like ""This Note's for You"", ""Fuckin' Up"", or even ""From Hank to Hendrix"" is unfortunate, too.</p>
<p>Of course, it's all too easy to nitpick any greatest-hits tracklist-- any of them could be said to carry grievous omissions or curious inclusions.  On one hand, this type of cursory overview isn't supposed to give us a detailed portrait of the artist, only a general sketch; on the other, Young is too complex a musician to be adequately represented by a mere 16 songs.  The music on <i>Greatest Hits</i> holds up undeniably well, but the concept itself-- perhaps inevitably-- falters, failing to capture the essence of one of rock's sturdiest and most ragged voices.</p></div>"|8854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8854-greatest-hits/|8.0|Stephen M.

It's seething with pretty little coke-fed nihilists with shards of hair and vintage fabrics jutting from their dancing skeletons. Skid row after parties are 10 times more populated than the actual shows, and the hordes toast caffeinated vodkas to a vacuous neo-dancepunk set by a B-list celebrity DJ. It's enough to make one want to get the hell out of town, but of course it's difficult to even afford a full tank of gas these days.  So instead hitch a ride with fellow Angelenos, Autolux, on their debut <i>Future Perfect</i>. Their optimism is reassuring.</p><p>
    
    In the first 10 seconds of album opener ""Turnstile Blues"", Carla Azar shames most every beatmaker with her ridiculous Leibezeit-cum-Bonham percussion. Azar's sturdy and creative drumming provides the thrust of Greg Edwards' heavily reverbed and distorted riffs. Meanwhile, Eugene Goreshter sings whispery lullabies of escape and alienation, and his rumbling bass rattles the brain. ""So what/ It's alright,"" he sighs, ""They're waiting for you to go.""</p><p>
    
    It's not until ""Sugarless""-- 15 minutes into <i>Future Perfect</i>-- that Autolux veer slightly and strangely away from relentless noise-pop. Like a super-cute HAL9000, Azar's soothing monotone says she's ""over it."" Over what? All of a sudden, Goreshter starts ""whoo-hoo""-ing and we realize we're hurtling toward infinity with a bunch of goddamn lunatics. The middle passage seesaws between swaggering glam and ethereal anxiety. ""Capital Kind Of Strain"" is the ship out of fuel, tumbling aimlessly through the void; ""Asleep at the Trigger"" shuts down the boosters altogether.</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly, the record's production is handled by T-Bone Burnett, soundtrack producer of the Coen Brothers' rustic comedy <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>. Burnett's laissez-faire style somehow matches as well with Autolux's intense dynamic as it does with Appalachian folk songs. He allows the musicians to speak for themselves-- the only evidence of his existence being the sound of his grumpy ass bumping around the studio in between a few songs. </p><p>
    
    The obvious talking points here are Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine, but the history of the Autolux's band members cannot be overlooked. All three survived late-90s ""alternative rock"", most notably Edwards, who was a member of Failure. That band's <i>Fantastic Planet</i>-- along with the twin moons of Cobain and Corgan-- orbits off in the distance on much of <i>Future Perfect</i>.</p><p>
    
    That said, the album sounds like the work of a band that has been in suspended animation for the past five years, hidden away from the torrent of the new wave revival and the reutn of disco as a viable rock touchstone. Azar, Edwards, and Goreshter now emerge from their slumber, preserved and prepared, ready to scorch the earth with their afterburn.</p></div>"|459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/459-future-perfect/|8.3|Peter Macia

Radiohead is one sterling example. Fugazi is another. The Beatles, natch. And if you play acoustic, folky music with a sinister edge and don't want to be compared to Will Oldham, your best bet is to shave daily.</p><p>
    
    But drawing bands into constellations of similarity is <em>de rigueur</em> in music reviews, not to mention their most serviceable function for readers who want buying guides rather than insight. What does the conscientious critic do when a band comes along who sounds like a lionized reference point in a meaningful way? To ignore it seems a slight to the reader; to mention it, a slight to the musician.</p><p>
    
    It seems the wisest course is to touch upon the similarity, but not to harp on it. When listening to The Stugglers's new EP, <em>The Fair Store</em>, Palace Music's <em>Viva Last Blues</em> instantly comes to mind: The ominous, spare folk, classic pop-rock traces, and faintly cracking vocals are of a piece with it. And since principal Struggler Randy Bickford doesn't even have a beard, you know I really mean it. But <em>A Fair Store</em> doesn't feel like a Palace facsimile-- Bickford doesn't sing about fucking mountains or anything, although he did contribute a great take on ""Riding"" to Tract's recent Oldham tribute-- it just happens to be tonally congruent.</p><p>
    
    It isn't dificult to understand why simplistic, lo-fi folk that blends modernity and antiquity is popular: It pares music down to a naked, vulnerable state where it'll stand or fall by the smallest gestures of melody, phrasing, and mood. When it doesn't work, it's usually still pleasant, if anonymous. When it does-- as in the hands of Oldham, Sam Beam, John Darnielle, and yes, Bickford-- it's often powerful.</p><p>
    
    In lo-fi folk, a distinctive voice is a must: Bickford's is strong and resonant, richly inflected, exhibiting its range most fully on the mobile melody that snakes over the strummed guitar and wistful pedal steel of ""Goodness Gracious"", and the aching, flaring inflections of the plodding title track. His voice's soft, faltering tendencies balance its steely edge. It attains the precarious ratio of gentleness to rawness that makes a singer memorable.</p><p>
    
    The melodies are winning and straightforward, laced with understated crescendos and tightly controlled flourishes. The clipped guitar and piano of ""Until I Slept"", like most of the EP, manages to be both sweet and bracing. <em>A Fair Store</em> is the most ""produced"" effort we've heard from The Strugglers. Its guitars, drums, piano, and pedal steel are arrayed in tidy procession, but are still played close to the bone. The melody of ""Light Weight"" seems a bit de-fanged; otherwise, the EP is clean but not sterile, and it retains a homegrown appeal.</p><p>
    
    The lyrics are unostentatious and the imagery is stark-- the personal opens up into the universal thanks to Bickford's suggestive, elliptical couplets. In the end, the personal/universal dichotomy is essential. To be effective, the genre sometimes called ""beardfolk"" must be at once specific-- as it's so strongly rooted in personal experience-- and general enough not to abandon folk's long history of palpating the collective and transmitting heritage. It must be old and new at the same time. It's musicians such as Bickford-- pursuing individuality while honoring the greater tradition-- who distinguish themselves from the legion.</p></div>"|7790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7790-the-fair-store/|7.5|Brian Howe

So sign the times: many microhouse producers are going after broader sounds (cf Ricardo Villalobos' <i>Alcachofa</i>, Michael Mayer's <i>Touch</i>), bigger hooks (cf Luomo's <i>The Present Lover</i>, Matthew Dear's <i>Leave Luck To Heaven</i>) or, in one impressive recent case, a high-stakes aversion to both hooks and variety (Villalobos' <i>The Au Harem D'Archimede</i>).</p><p>
    
    Losoul's Peter Kremeier has served consistently good, high-and-wide smorgasboard house for years, but upon release much of it fell victim to anachronism. His early 12-inches and 2000 full-length debut <i>Belong</i> were minimal enough to put him under the microhouse tent alongside much of the rest of Germany, but their warm strains of funk and soul undermined a lot of his trendy appeal, casting Losoul as a mere dilletante in the face of the strict clickers on Perlon and Kompakt.</p><p>
    
    Over the past four years, Kremeier's sensibilities haven't changed very much but given the genre's current climate of flirtation with disco and even trance, Losoul's follow-up album <i>Getting Even</i> comes off ironically enough as super-strict, textbook microhouse. Tracks like ""Railrude"", ""Brain Of Glass"", ""Insula"", and ""Matchbox"" are seven- and eight-minute monsters with no hurry or interest in gimmickry. Instead, Losoul squeezes every bit of energy out of his tight loops with the most insignificant of permutations. If anything, Losoul's funk and soul fetish has reconfigured itself into his instrumentation: dubby whiplashes of bass swoop in and out of tracks, and cutesy Fisher-Price piano synth heat <i>Getting Even</i> with nostalgic if not kitschy flickers of color.</p><p>
    
    Vocal tracks have always been hit-or-miss for Losoul, and the ones on <i>Getting Even</i> do nothing to change his track record. The goth-schaffel ""Warrior (Rock)"" grandly stomps with trashy reverb and clogged-artery guitar distortion, but the techy-ditty ""You Know"" sounds boxed, and the drugged out heroin's-back vocals on closer ""Blood Sample"" ruin the song's loop-finding-jazz cool down.</p><p>
    
    Not to spite Losoul's in-a-vacuum persona, but <i>Getting Even</i>'s best moments are when he's most trendy: ""Tango Acido"" is italo-disco with a pre-Ritalin attention span and the most melodically charged non-melody I've heard in a while. Metal-house cruncher ""Brain Of Glass"" could have been on the latest <i>Speicher</i> compilation, offering an answer to an old question of mine: What would it sound like if Kraftwerk covered Planet Funk's ""The Switch""?</p><p>
<i>Getting Even</i> is hardly a step back from <i>Belong</i>-- everything here is much tighter, and as a whole the release feels much more focused-- but as mere fancy, I can't help but wonder how Losoul would figure into the current tech-house pantheon had he released <i>Getting Even</i> four years ago and <i>Belong</i> this past September. Both are strong albums, but more suggestively, both are telling of how little ""strong album"" can mean to listeners caught up in the latest trend.</p></div>"|4973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4973-getting-even/|7.4|Nick Sylvester

    ""Two years ago, Page Hamilton-- singer, guitarist and founder of the proto-metal outfit Helmet-- was driving around Los Angeles with the radio on. The jock on duty had just debuted the hotly anticipated new track from some xFC-metal millionaires.""</p><p>
    And, as you might have guessed, the story (and this promo pitch) ends <i>in medias res</i>, with Helmet, unwavering bastion of all things Hard and Rock, emerging from the dry ice mists of obscurity and obsolescence to rescue the tired, huddled, headbanging masses from the ever-growing throng of bare-ass emperors. Glory be unto they who bring forth The Rock for their people beset by The Rot, were that it be The Rock they actually bring forth.</p><p>
    If Helmet had one thing going for them in their prime, it was a monochromatic discipline. They gave fans a gussied-up version of the working class scree proffered by Big Black and other Albini disciples.  With Helmet, the guitars cut like lasers, not pavement saws. The rhythms were efficient and martial, not frenetically robotic.  And while Albini's words were flecked with coal dust and offal and the scarring of 12-hour work days, Hamilton barked and yelped like a guy earning union wages with full benefits and 401K matching. Helmet did lack a certain visceral passion, but they were precise and exacting and brutal and-- when all the metaphors are bagged and tagged-- Helmet did indeed rock. It's safe to say that Helmet's million-dollar Interscope contract (inked circa 1991) paved the way for all the xFC-metal millionaires Hamilton now finds himself both befriending and opposing.</p><p>
    So, of course, in the era the unnecessary umlaut-- when the sound that made Helmet well-respected kings of rock are now commonplace among both standard bearers (Deftones, Tool, Slipknot) and shysters (take your pick), and it's safe for MTV's ""Headbanger's Ball"" to return to the airwaves-- Helmet releases a record that's about as hard as a loofah.  A DJ could easily slip tracks like ""Drug Lord"" and ""Unwound"" between offerings from Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age.  In fact, Burning Airlines could probably sue for copyright infringement-- ""See You Dead"" : ""Wheaton Calling :: ""Ice Ice Baby"" : ""Under Pressure"".</p><p>
    Instead of reinventing the wheel (or perhaps the tank tread), Helmet attempt to diversify their portfolio, offering dynamics and approachable melodies and other types of listener-friendly capitulations one wouldn't associate with the folks that dropped ""Meantime"" and ""Unsung"". The group's online bio claims Page &amp; Co. (old Helmeteer Chris Traynor and new guys John Tempesta and Frank Bello-- veterans of Testament and Anthrax, respectively) didn't set out to make <i>Meantime, Part II</i> with this new record; rather, they made <i>Wilma</i>, a less varied version of their confounding post-breakthrough album <i>Betty</i>.</p><p>
    Therein lies part of the problem. As I said, Helmet's strength is their lack of diversity-- the group is a lumbering, slow-footed, imposing heavyweight, and it succeeds by beating opponents into submission. It's awkward to witness such a gloriously thuggish monster vainly attempt the rope-a-dope. Part of this pop-centric bait-and-switch is shifting the focus away from the guitars and hi-hats towards the vocals. Unfortunately, the ""singing"" on <i>Size Matters</i> happens in two modes: the hoarse bark and the nasal sneer. Both of these styles are evident on the album's first track, ""Smart"", and neither do the group any favors. Page Hamilton as R. Lee Ermey in <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> (authoritative, stern) = yes, sir!  Page Hamilton as R. Lee Ermey in <i>Saving Silverman</i> (emotive, awkward) = unfit for command.</p><p>
    Worse yet, Helmet's clipped monosyllabic lyrical M.O. (consistent throughout their recorded output) doesn't jibe with this slight stylistic shift.  It's safe to say that lyrics were never Helmet's strong suit (""I'd like to see you/ In two pieces/ Won't be walking/ Barely breathing/ I'd like to see you/ At my door/ We're together/ Like before""), but it's not going to do any good to draw attention to them.</p><p>
    Granted, there's enough wicked fretwork and cool guitar noise throughout this record to both recall past glories and satiate those in need of a modern rock fix. Just be warned that there are some hoops to jump through. Also be wary if you believe the hype and are hoping that Helmet have returned to save us from the upstarts and charlatans who pass themselves off as metal. Indeed, Helmet have met the enemy-- and, unfortunately, the enemy is Helmet.</p></div>"|3812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3812-size-matters/|5.4|David Raposa

I myself am not above such occasional ballyhoo, most recently biting the hook hard on recently fashionable hyphenated mergers of electronics and rock, be it dance-punk or lap-pop or lance-ponk. I was completely convinced (and still am, to some extent) that guitars and computers were on the verge of ending their long, heated standoff, and that they would start making the hip new music of the future.</p><p>
    Well, among the many public services of the reissue is to remind us that there is usually nothing new under the musical sun, and so now, here's a 10th anniversary edition of <i>The Downward Spiral</i> to remind me that The Postal Service are just NIN in a better mood. When the album was first released, I wasn't concerned with any technological achievements Trent Reznor may have been conjuring-- I was too distracted by his concepts of fucking like animals, god being dead (and no one caring), and I am a big man yesIam.  Sure, NIN might have provided a perfect dose of loud guitars and screaming to score my melodramatic years, but what most drew me to collect Halos was the atmosphere: fake snuff film videos, drummer microphone injuries, the Sharon Tate murder house, and lyrical self-mutilation that made Cobain sound like Vedder.</p><p>
    Now that I'm old, boring, and presumably less susceptible to the trappings of angst, it's possible to peel back that surface layer of fishnet and makeup and take a peek at the music underneath. And surprisingly, for music built on what I'm sure was cutting edge audio technology of the early 90s, <i>The Downward Spiral</i> sounds only the slightest bit aged, and not too far flung from the aggro-beats that still rule alt-rock formats. I'd even go so far as to affix Reznor with the cliché label ""ahead of his time,"" despite the decade's worth of Wax Trax! 12-inches that surely influenced him.  Still, even with all that precedent, Reznor must've done <i>something</i> to usher industrial music into the mainstream.</p><p>
    My best guess is that Nine Inch Nails hit upon just the right amount of dance music content to gloss up his dire tunes without scaring off the homophobes.  Reznor's dance leanings are constantly bubbling just under the surface of <i>The Downward Spiral</i>, and it nearly goes without saying that the breakout hit, ""Closer"", leaned a bit more obviously in that direction than most of the rest of the album.  Easily the record's sexiest song and slinkiest beat, its disco thump still sounds markedly current.  Meanwhile, ""Heresy"", for all its Nietzsche-inspired deicide, is a couple clicks of the distortion dial away from being a Depeche Mode song.  And don't forget, ""March of the Pigs"" beat ""Firestarter"" to the digital hardcore punch by three years.</p><p>
    The B-side-filled second disc of this reissue assists this hindsight.  Reznor was always fond of emphasizing clubby rhythms rather than tortured screams on his many, many self-remixes.  I've always preferred ""Piggy (Nothing Can Stop Me Now)"" from the excellent <i>Further Down the Spiral</i> EP to the album version. The remix replaced the original's jazzy sparseness with a graveyard of broken breakbeats. ""Closer to God"" and ""All the Pigs, All Lined Up"" confirm two of my above appraisals of <i>Downward Spiral</i> album tracks.  And for fuck's sake, there's even a cover of Soft Cell's ""Memorabilia"" to balance out the much-too-easy goth karaoke of ""Dead Souls"", the set's other homage.</p><p>
    Of course, <i>The Downward Spiral</i> wasn't just opening my early-teen eyes to the wonders of blasphemy and extended remixes, but also to the joy of the concept album-- in coordination with <i>Melon Collie &amp; the Infinite Sadness</i>, 1994/5 was a bumper crop for thematic excess.  Reznor might've gone off the art-rock deep end with <i>The Fragile</i>, an album I have absolutely no recollection of whatsoever, but <i>The Downward Spiral</i> still holds together, aided by a few musical reprises and its monochromatic lyrical content.  Reznor had his album dynamics down pat at the time, chasing the brutal Gaspar Noe rape of ""Big Man with a Gun"" with ""A Warm Place"", the closest thing a teenager got to Eno in that era.  Even the much-overrated ""Hurt"", which I didn't even like in the hands of a dying country singer, is a suitable post-storm calm.</p><p>
    That Reznor's chainsaw guitars haven't dulled after a decade of Stabbing Filter Manson knockoffs is gratifying, and that they still cut glass-- remastering or no-- is a credit to his production skills.  With the benefit of Dolby 5.1 and SACD somethingorother, I'm sure the scream typhoons of ""The Becoming"" and the sedimentary synth layers of ""Eraser"" sound delightful on stereos I can't afford; (Best Buy wouldn't let me blast ""Ruiner"" in the demo room.)  But even in obsolete stereophonic, the peekaboo drums of ""Piggy"" and the oscillating broken piano of ""Closer"" still impress.</p><p>
    Which is why it's a shame Reznor has largely been in seclusion since <i>The Fragile</i> shattered on impact.  Since then, he's only emerged to restart old feuds and produce a terrible Zach de la Rocha single.  Even if his songwriting talents flamed out after <i>The Downward Spiral</i>'s extreme catharsis (how do you out-dread ""I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel?""), why has he been so selfish with his talents behind the board?  While NIN remains in limbo, watered-down versions pollute the airwaves, hysterical critics forget that electronics and rock have met before, and only the occasional anniversary reissue reminds them that a Pennsylvania goth with a bad haircut was on to something underneath all the provocation.</p></div>"|5802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5802-the-downward-spiral-deluxe-edition/|8.3|Rob Mitchum

It begins tentatively with ""Chardonnay"", an unrecorded ode to white wine by Nashville songwriter Roger Cook; gradually becomes more confident over the first half; hits its stride just before the instrumental interlude; peaks over three songs; and ends on a hopeful note with an arrangement of the traditional ""All My Trials"".</p><p>
    
    Perhaps this progression wouldn't be so noteworthy-- or even as noticeable-- if it were assembled by any other artist. But Cockahoop is Matthews' first recorded work since Catatonia's lackluster final album, <i>Paper Scissors Stone</i>, which followed her stint in rehab and preceded the band's dissolution in 2001.  After some time off, Matthews decamped to Nashville to work with producer and lap steel player Bucky Baxter, who helped corral an impressive roster of local country music veterans like pedal steel player Lloyd Green, former Notorious Cherry Bomb Richard Bennett, and bassist Dave Pomeroy, as well as former Wilco drummer Ken Coomer and Old Crow Medicine Show banjoist Ketcham Secor. The result is certainly influenced by Nashville country, but like some sort of exchange student program, it also incorporates British elements, including bazouki and bass flute.  Lending to the international vibe, Matthews sings ""La Bague"" in French and the traditional hymn ""Arglwydd Dyma Fi"" in her native Welsh.</p><p>
<i>Cockahoop</i> dynamically reflects Matthews' re-immersion into music.  The first half (before the intermission) sounds like she's dipping her toe in the water, easing into the sessions not timidly, but warily, as if disappointment looms. ""Chardonnay"" is a brave choice to kick off a post-rehab album, and ""Caught in the Middle"" and ""Louisiana"" are low-key excursions on which Matthews sounds like she's holding back vocally.  Her delivery is whispery and subdued compared to her powerhouse vocals on Catatonia songs like ""Road Rage"" and ""Apple Core.""  She sounds vulnerable here-- battered a bit by life, but still wide-eyed and hopeful.</p><p>
    
    By the second half, starting with ""Arglwydd Dyma Fi"", her vocals have grown bolder and much more confident-- she sings ""If You're Lookin' for Love"" like a giddy come-on, even cracking up on the second verse as Baxter adds banjolele, bass harp, dobro, and saxophone.  The rafter-raising ""The Good in Good-Bye"" features a fuller sound and a brassy performance that owes more to Nashville legends like Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn than to anything Catatonia recorded.</p><p>
    
    The only dud comes with the Handsome Family cover ""Weightless Again"". Singing Rennie Sparks' lines, Matthews pretends to know the answer to ""Why people O.D. on pills/ And jump from the Golden Gate Bridge.""  It is, of course, ""to feel weightless again.""  But <i>Cockahoop</i> sounds best when Matthews doesn't pretend to have the answers, as on the closer ""All My Trials,"" where she calmly accepts that ""all my trials, lord, will soon be over.""</p></div>"|5619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5619-cockahoop/|7.4|Stephen M.

Why did ""Pole"" have to retire his vinyl-mastering machine? It had so much poetry. The harmonies of a stylus bludgeoning vinyl surfaces to death as narcotic dub basslines and guitar jangles trudge through the hallways of an ex-Eastern Bloc housing project-- that was all virgin territory back in '99.</p><p>
    
    Most of the earliest artists on Betke's ~scape label seemed to extend our man's glitches-- including Kit Clayton's ectoplasmic subterranean-dub and Jan Jelinek's loops, which robotized soul-jazz records.</p><p>
    
    ""Glitches"" are barely heard on <i>But Then Again</i>, ~scape's fifth-anniversary release. That's because the album collects work from the label's current roster, a group that now focus on contorting rhythms and harmonies into new, yet rather familiar shapes. Given ~scape's feted advancements of yore, few risks are taken here, but <i>But Then Again</i> still entertains.</p><p>
    
    Opener, Cappablack's ""5th Dimension (Anti-imperialism Disco)"" shoves the listener against the wall with its sample of a lady shouting about her inability to solve a math problem. A post-Neptunes crunk beat follows as their rapper struggles to teach astrophysics. What this has to do with ""anti-imperialism"" is up to you. Bus &amp; Dabrye's ""What Is Paris?"" is better rooted in b-boy culture thanks to its electro-funk moogs and stubbed-toe beats that sound like a hungover Kraftwerk. John Tejada's ""And Many More"" is a curious microhouse ballad that laments over Nintendo GameBoy melodies-- ultimately evoking the experience of staring at tombstone apartments at dusk.</p><p>
    
    The artists who say the most with the slightest gestures create <i>But Then Again</i>'s highlights. Jan Jelinek's ""Western Mimikry"" brilliantly dangles a loop of a sleepwalking jazz-guitar riff in the breeze. Andrew Pekler's ""Unidentified"" is fine, absthine-jazz that flickers obtuse rhythms-- as if Teo Macero produced Miles Davs in 2072. And then there is Mike Shannon's ""Remembrance"" which lets a geothermal dub rhythm find its way in the dark, while guest chanteuse June scolds, ""You promised heaven far, far away!""</p><p>
    
    The record's mid-lights are civil and pay their taxes. In ""We Like It Slow and Steady"", Deadbeat remixes his older dub thunderclaps into R&amp;B; that encircles a streetlight. System's ""Hu Ra!!"" clicky-clacks to a toy solider cadence with a melodica and clarinet duet frowning at the world. Headset &amp; Soulo's ""The Fall of Knee High"" scores a few brownie points for its Tom Waits-mused, chain-gang beats and squealing harmonicas.</p><p>
    
    Let's just hope that ~scape doesn't see gold mines in the AOR-dub of Triola's ""Neuland"" and the Starbucks-friendly, lite-jazz of Epo's ""Doorstep"", on which their frontwoman sings ""sweet, sweet cherry pie"" in an herbal tea-watered croon.</p><p>
    
    Hey, wait a minute. Where did Pole go? Mr. Betke didn't even show up at his own party. But then again, maybe it's best to leave broken machines alone.</p></div>"|1976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1976-but-then-again/|7.3|Cameron Macdonald

I always thought that was bogus, particularly as the idea of emotionally honest music devolved into a marketing pose called ""emo."" Hell, just last week soon-to-be-erstwhile Secretary of State Colin Powell said the Bush Administration would refuse to recognize the closely contested electoral victor in Ukraine. But if shock-savoring joke-punk group Dwarves' latest album is any bellwether, perhaps all those <i>The New York Times</i> Op-Ed writers and cable-news talking hairdos were onto something after all.</p><p>
    
    Back when Dwarves ruled the earth (or at least the stoned free time of certain Circle Jerks-worshipping Blockbuster clerks), the joke was on any square who took them seriously. Dwarves' kinky brand of hardcore punk was as funny as it was offensive. ""Old enough to pee, then she's old enough for me,"" barked frontman Blag Dahlia on ""Let's Fuck"" from the band's 1990 master (masturbatory?) stroke, <em>Blood Guts &amp; Pussy</em>. But then 2000's buttfuck-by-numbers <em>Come Clean</em> marked a clear softening from hilarious stupidity to stupid stupidity.</p><p>
    
    This time the joke's on Dwarves. The sad thing is they don't even seem to realize it (more on that later). I wish the problem were just that their shock value had worn off, although it has. Little person on a crucifix and three naked chicks? Please, we've lived through Marilyn Manson and <em>Simple Life 2</em>. ""Fuck Eat and Fuck You Up"" has a momentarily amusing title, but who really wants to listen to White Zombie verses and Smashmouth choruses?</p><p>
    
    One of the few traditional hardcore tracks-- ""Dominator"", recycled from last year's <em>The L.A. Shakedown</em> compilation-- steals a metaphor from ""California Love"": ""You can't touch me/ I'm Elliot Ness."" Washed-up perv-rockers ripping off 2Pac and Dre isn't funny; it's pathetic and derivative, much like the cookie-cutter pop-punk of single ""Salt Lake City"", which features The Offspring's Dexter Holland. If there's any gleeful evil left in guitarist HeWhoCanNotBeNamed, he's wishing he could reprise the hoax of his own death that got the band canned from Sub Pop.</p><p>
    
    It's tough when you pick on targets half your size and you're <i>Dwarves</i>. The aforementioned ""Salt Lake City"" calls out the Osmonds for their lameness. Thank you, Captain Obvious. ""Massacre""-- one of a few misguided excursions into lobotomized rap-rock-- similarly disses sucka MCs like ""Bad"" Charlotte, ""Queens of the Trust Fund"", MTV, and Creed. Wait, Scott Stapp sucks now? Shit, I thought he rocked ""God Bless America"" during the World Series!
    
    ""Runaway #2"", is a bit stronger, infusing classic Ramones punk with (what else?) lyrics about Oedipal hospital bathroom fellatio. And admirers of quasi-Gregorian chants, Beastie Boy scratching and post-<em>Downward Spiral</em> Nine Inch Nails will soil their bloody briefs for ""Christ on a Mic"". It's ambitious, but then so is jihad. Come to think of it, maybe Dwarves should write a song about what they'd do with 10,000 virgins, or any other topic that might make them something close to relevant in 2004.</p><p>
    
    A THC-addled voice mumbles deep in my subconscious: ""Whoa, but man, what if, like, that's why the album is brilliant? Sure, it <i>seems</i> like idiocy upon idiocy, but what if that's the intentional construct of punk-rock demigods working on Another Level? After all, former Dwarves member and current Queen of the Stone Age Nick Oliveri appears on the record, too..."" In that case the album might be ironic, after all, but so what? If you're looking for shitty songs possibly spoofing shitty songs about shitty bands and shitty fucking, this Blag's for you.</p></div>"|2498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2498-must-die/|3.3|Marc Hogan

Though the group has steadily refined its thunderous sound, its path has also been peppered with so many digressions and departures that just when you think you've found the main road you realize the band has actually led you straight into the goddamn quicksand.</p><p>
    
    In fact, you might have to look back to late-80s vintage Butthole Surfers to find a band that so precariously balanced its art-rock ambitions with an unabashed and irreverent love for monolithic, sometimes psychedelic 70s heavy rock riffage. Like the Buttholes in their prime, Oneida maintain a relentless recording schedule, throwing new material into the marketplace quickly-- often without waiting until it's gathered into album-sized portions. On that tip they've now presented us with yet another EP, the strangely (but aptly?) titled <i>Nice: Splittin' Peaches</i>.</p><p>
    
    At the beginning of the year-- when Oneida delivered their 6th album, <i>Secret Wars</i>-- it seemed that songs like ""$50 Tea"" or the epic ""Changes in the City"" brought their affinity for pummeling, repetitive psych-rock riffs to a logical and ecstatic conclusion, leaving it difficult to guess how the group might continue on without backtracking. Thankfully, on these four songs Oneida broaden their vistas and move in enticing new directions.</p><p>
    
    The big-ticket item is the stupefying 14-minute extravaganza ""Hakuna Matata"". Now, I'm pleased to admit that I've never seen one frame of Disney's <i>The Lion King</i>, but I have unfortunately been exposed to its soundtrack. So while I can't claim to be an expert, I feel pretty confident this track shares nothing in common with the Elton John/Tim Rice-penned anthem besides its title, a sprightly tempo, and perhaps a certain <i>esprit de corps</i>. Although Oneida have produced ambitious trance-rock marathons in the past-- tracks as ""Sheets of Easter"" from 2002's <i>Each One Teach One</i>-- they've always placed just as much emphasis on the rock as on the trance. But on ""Hakuna Matata"" the group travels beyond rock: disembodied voices hover around drummer Kid Millions' unyielding hypnotic pulse and snaky rattles. Despite its length, the track seems to melt by in an eyeblink.</p><p>
    
    The EP's other three songs are much shorter and less audacious, though certainly not without their moments. The Beefheartian ""Summerland"" is enlivened by some scalding saxophone courtesy of veteran William Parker collaborator and Gold Sparkle Band member Charles Waters. ""Inside My Head"" is Oneida at their catchiest, featuring some outlandishly flabby tones from Bobby Matador's organ as well as what are surely some of the year's most believable lyrics (""It's all fucked up now/ Living inside my head""). The extremely brief ""Song Y"" pleasantly blends falsetto vocals and acoustic guitar with percolating keyboards, blowing out a couple square-shaped bubbles that, although pretty, are likely unfit for long-term survival.</p><p>
    
    About the only question left unanswered is whether or not the highlights of <i>Nice: Splittin' Peaches</i> are an indication of further treats to come or if they've once again duped us down a blind alley. Either way, I'm looking forward to Oneida's next move.</p></div>"|6000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6000-nice-splittin-peaches-ep/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

    involves bands like The Replacements and is meant to demonstrate that, despite perceived greatness among fans, the group in question
    was denied access to the big time.  But Nirvana was <em>the</em> global rock band for a few years not so long ago, so if it's true that
    Generation Z is ambivalent at best, well, that seems a little strange-- especially considering how much every popular American rock
    band-- the P.O.D.s and Linkin Parks, for example-- owe them.</p><p>
    
    After allowing Nirvana to lie fallow for almost a decade following the release of the live album <i>From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah</i>,
    Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, and Courtney Love are now working to reverse this trend.  A box set containing a promised mother lode of
    unreleased recordings was first discussed a few years ago, but it was delayed by legal squabbles.  Eventually, Love was granted her
    wish to release an eponymous best-of complete with ""You Know You're Right"", considered the cream of the then-unreleased crop.
    <em>Nirvana</em> did little to bolster the band's legacy, though, and with its lone new song, the collection-- otherwise pulled from
    a tiny catalog-- was most often discussed to explain the appeal of illegal file-sharing.</p><p>
    
    Now the long-awaited box arrives, bearing three music discs, a live DVD, notes by Strauss and Thurston Moore, a wonderfully obsessive
    recording history (though no discography), and ugly metallic packaging that would have made Cobain, an accomplished visual artist,
    throw up.  Only nine of the set's 51 tracks have been previously released (though many have been bootlegged), and those are culled
    from B-sides and compilation appearances.  It's a scruffy hodgepodge of solo acoustic and full-band demos, radio shots, and live
    recordings, hugely variable in terms of sound, songwriting, and performance quality.</p><p>
    
    So, first, the bad news: Those hoping for a trove of overlooked gems will be disappointed, as too much of <i>With the Lights Out</i>
    sounds like nothing so much as a dull-edged instrument lifting flakes of material from the bottom of a barrel.  Simply put, there's
    enough good stuff here for a solid single disc.  Beyond padding the release to box-set length, why include a sub-Barlow stab at
    four-track tape manipulation (""Beans""), <i>two</i> versions of ""Polly"" to go with the four already released (every Nirvana record on
    Geffen except <i>In Utero</i> features this middling song), <i>two</i> demos of ""Rape Me"" showcasing Cobain at his self-conscious
    worst, and a number of live tracks that sound like they were recorded on overused speech cassettes?  If tossed-off experiments and
    poorly recorded demos of familiar songs are fair game, one imagines the Nirvana vaults stretching into bottomless ""Dick's Picks""
    infinity.</p><p>
    
    Still, the live and demo overkill can't erase Cobain's status as a great songwriter and (usually) one of rock's best vocalists, so
    there's still a fair amount of content here to enjoy.  ""If You Must"" and ""Pen Cap Chew"" immortalize pre-<i>Bleach</i> Nirvana as
    self-loathing, drop-tuned stoners-- endearing qualities that never quite disappeared from their better known recordings.  ""Even in
    His Youth"" has that classic combination of short, tense verses with a defusing swoop of chorus.  And 1991's ""Old Age"" is loose and
    midtempo, showing Cobain stretching himself melodically, breaking free of the clipped phrases and soft/loud style that was serving
    him so well at the time.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Verse Chorus Verse"" is a completely different song than the one released under the same name on the <i>No Alternative</i>
    compilation (that one was originally called ""Sappy"", and is also included here), but shows a similar easy restraint.  The nine-minute
    instrumental jam on ""Scentless Apprentice"" was also worth rescuing, showing the lumbering riff monster Nirvana could summon when in
    the mood.  Additionally, versions of four Leadbelly songs, including ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"", document Cobain's strange
    obsession with the early folk singer.</p><p>
    
    Oddly, despite its big holiday marketing push, this is probably a set for the Nirvana fanatics in search of a complete picture of the
    band, particularly because many of its pleasures are purely historical.  There's no definitive date on the horribly recorded rehearsal
    demo of ""Smells Like Teen  Spirit"" but it's interesting to note that the structure of the song, down to the tiniest detail, was already
    complete.  And Cobain's off-the-chain scream is completely exhilarating despite the bad sound.  Same goes for ""Dive"", which remains
    powerful though the band is ragged and Cobain can't quite muster the vocal power of the <i>Incesticide</i> version.</p><p>
    
    About 20 of these tracks are solo acoustic demos, offering a leering look into Cobain's creative process. One thing we learn is that
    he wasn't a good acoustic guitarist, at least not when he was sitting at home on whatever he was on.  The sloppy strumming on ""Sliver""
    and ""Pennyroyal Tea"" is distracting, but not nearly as disconcerting as the solo demo of ""Rape Me"", on which Cobain seems to be
    struggling to maintain consciousness.  This is where the box set makes you feel a little gross, pawing through the musical equivalent
    of Cobain's journals, listening to things he never intended to release.</p><p>
    
    The DVD, on the other hand, includes some more lighthearted voyeuristic moments that are the highlight of the box.  The first nine
    tracks are given over to a 1988 rehearsal at Novoselic's mom's house, and it's a huge kick to see Cobain and Novoselic so young and
    goofy, hanging out with a few neighborhood dudes and jamming like any other local band.  For whatever reason, Cobain sings facing a
    wall with his nose two inches from the simulated wood paneling.  They have a ball with Zep (""Immigrant Song""), but then they bust out
    ""About a Girl"" and we remember that this is not your everyday garage band.  When they crank up the strobe light and hold a bottle of
    Rainier up to the camera, it's adorable enough that you might feel inclined to hug somebody.  Fittingly, most of the remainder of the
    DVD features pre-fame shows and miscellaneous tour footage; technically, it's generally of poor quality, but enjoyable nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    Though <i>With the Lights Out</i> is in many respects unsatisfying and shows Geffen to be rudderless with their handling of the Nirvana
    legacy, in the end, it's nearly enough that it documents so much material we haven't heard a million times before.  And despite the
    complete predictability and heavy-handedness of closing the set with the solo demo of ""All Apologies"", the effect is still emotionally
    devastating.  When Cobain was numb on heroin he missed the comfort in being sad, and if nothing else, <i>With the Lights Out</i> brings
    us back to this nourishing place.</p></div>"|5811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5811-with-the-lights-out/|6.3|Mark Richardson

Not quite a skirt, not quite a dish rag, the Stefani bum flap dangles off the guts of our divorced aunts and 12-year-old mall-slut daughters, the ones who steal Livestrong bracelets and dry-hump public schoolkids in Pac Sun dressing rooms.  Bum flaps are these people's stars and stripes.  Not all of us want to salute this flag, but it exists, and it gives America something else to believe in-- and it's not nearly as expensive as a valium addiction or Kaplan SAT course.</p><p>
    
    As widely predicted, 35-year old singer/fashionista Stefani has temporarily given up No Doubt to fully embrace a high-pop lifestyle with nary a pierced tongue in-cheek. The metamorphosis began with her Eve and Dr. Dre collaboration on 2001's killer single ""Let Me Blow Ya Mind"", and is completed here with her solo debut <i>Love Angel Music Baby</i>, a spineless, starfucked advertisement for her high-end clothing line.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, we can't expect 12 more cuts as personal or urgent as debut single ""What You Waiting For"", Stefani's slick self-steeling kick in the pitch-corrected plaids, and one of the best electro songs this year-- especially when the pop star openly PRs that she didn't ""really see [<i>LAMB</i>] as a 'solo' record in the typical sense... The idea was to be open and let my ego shut up and sit over in the corner and make something great based on a concept.""  If Stefani wants to sacrifice her identity, that's fine, but hot Christ, she's working with everyone from Andre 3000 to the Neptunes to New Order to Dr. Dre here.  So why isn't <i>LAMB</i> bigger, better, faster, more?  Is it the scourge of 4 Non Blondes' Linda Perry, who coaxed Stefani into finishing the solo project and all but forced her back into the studio because Perry reportedly only ""had a brief window of time available""?  What's going on?</p><p>
    
    In fairness, one of the Andre tracks, ""Bubble Pop Electric"", isn't half-bad, a brave Prince-goes-Stray Cats doowop shuffle with a great hook and an Andre-as-Johnny Vulture gentleman boyfriend cameo.  The track is silly and fun, and probably exactly what Stefani et al., wanted out of <i>LAMB</i>.  Which is what makes Andre's second contribution, ""Long Way to Go"", so perplexing: The maudlin MLK Jr. samples and the duet's pointed appeal to interracial dating (""We've got a long way to go!/ It's beyond Martin Luthur/ Upgrade computer"") feel out of place on an otherwise carefree album boasting lines like, ""You know you are my treasure chest,"" and, ""We got hydroponic love/ And we smoke it.""</p><p>
    
    And another thing about Stefani's treasure chests-- not to mention, ""We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top""; the Eve- and Dre- and Tevye-powered camp-hop ""Rich Girl""; ""I only want to fly first class desires (you're my limousine)""; ""We're luxurious like Egyptian cotton""; ""If I was a wealthy girl/ I'd get me four Harajuku girls to inspire me""; the unintentionally offensive orientalist fetishism, ""Now we get to lay back""; ""Ch-Ching Ch-Ching-- we're loaded and we're not going to blow it""; the soulless Nellee Hooper 90s R&amp;B; vanity affair ""Luxurious""; and the rest of <i>LAMB</i>'s zombied buy-<i>LAMB</i>-clothing mantras and transparent Hollywood Dream bullshit-- the Joker's free-money parade through Gotham City was a much more entertaining display of wealth, and he had Prince, not just Wendy &amp; Lisa.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere on <i>LAMB</i>, the Neptunes shit out a Queen pastiche called ""Hollaback Girl"", which has about as much club potential as a 13-year old with a milk moustache and his dad's ID.  For ""The Real Thing"", co-producers and co-players New Order unbizarrify, unlove, and untriangulate ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" just enough that the millions of people who heard about New Order on <i>Karaoke Revolution</i> won't notice the similarities right away.  Seriously, anyone remotely involved with ""The Real Thing"" should find a stray dog and let it bite him.</p><p>
    
    So, final tally: <i>LAMB</i> has one mega-hit, one okay song, three stillborns, and seven full-fledged embarrassments.  For Stefani, fashion has officially come first; to her credit, these songs are the slickest, shiniest, bum-flappiest failures of the year.</p></div>"|7789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7789-love-angel-music-baby/|5.1|Nick Sylvester

Our brains are complex computers but it doesn't take much to short the circuits. We're constantly constructing patterns based on context.</p>
<p><i>Virðulegu forsetar</i> is a long piece in four parts that depends heavily on juxtaposition. Over the course of an hour it continues to repeat a single phrase on trumpets, french horns, and tubas. Though simple, it's a bold little cluster of notes with an inherent grandeur, and the brassiest voicing early in the piece suggests a fanfare before a great announcement. But Jóhannsson invests the refrain with a host of different meanings by slowing it down, shifting the pitch, putting it beside all sorts of interesting drones, and making it disappear completely for minutes on end. Over its length the piece undergoes remarkable shifts in mood and feel, which is even more notable considering the basic instrumentation (in addition to the brass, it's scored for organs, piano, bass, glockenspiel, and subtle electronics) is the same throughout.</p>
<p>So <i>Virðulegu forsetar</i> is about minimalism and repetition, obviously, but it's also one of the most patient records I've heard.  Where last year's equally great <i>Englabörn </i>album consisted of chamber pieces at pop-song length, <i>Virðulegu forsetar</i> should be taken in all at once and in a proper way.  Listen to it loud and the organ/electronic rumble connecting the melodic bits comes alive, with odd bits of noise perfectly mucking up the pristinely deep bass pedals.  The held tones become vitally important as the piece progresses and the primary motif slows to a crawl; with more space between the notes the connecting drone that stretches to infinity becomes the focus.  The horns are always around the corner.  At times they're wounded and barely able to sound, but they're always there.  Toward the end there's a stretch of silence almost two minutes long before one last gasp of the opening theme carries the piece out on an exhausted note.</p>
<p>This gorgeous package contains a DVD audio disc with a 5.1 surround sound mix that attempts to replicate the feel of the original performance (I don't have the technology to hear it, unfortunately). <i>Virðulegu forsetar</i> was first performed in 2003 at Hallgrimskirkja, a large cathedral in Reykjavik, and the album was recorded in the same space.  During that first performance, players were positioned on all sides of the audience; it was spring in Iceland which meant a show starting around 11:00 p.m. would finish as the sun was setting. As a visual accompaniment, Jóhannsson filled the cathedral with helium balloons that were slightly underinflated, so that over the course of the piece they fell extremely slowly into the crowd.</p>
<p>Think for a moment what a fantastically beautiful image this is. And yet, there's nothing to it. An epic space, sure, but beyond that we're talking balloons, horns, and a keyboard.  Careful gestures, simple tools, and a good mind are all Jóhannsson needs.  This is the way to live.</p></div>"|4275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4275-virulegu-forsetar/|8.8|Mark Richardson

And yet, over the past few years, there has been increased interest in the blues-- mostly from white midwesterners who were introduced to it via Jimmy Page and Keith Richards. Of these new blues fetishistis, The White Stripes are the success story and The Black Keys are riding shotgun. Another Fat Possum artist, Guy Blakeslee-- the lightning-haired hippie-throwback from Entrance-- is also helping to reform a genre that has largely been forsaken since Page and Richards were clean.</p><p>
    
    After tours with Devendra Banhart and Cat Power, Blakeslee began to make a small underground clamor in 2003 with his <i>Honey Moan</i> EP. That disc showed potential, but Blakeslee has quickly blossomed. Using a peculiar guitar style-- he flips a right-handed guitar and plays it with his left-- Blakeslee creates a sound with enough feverish cacophony to raise Robert Johnson from his eternal deal. His second LP as Entrance, <i>Wandering Stranger</i>, picks up on the gutty Leadbelly-era moans of his first, tracing the eternal welcome in age-old standards while creating novel originals steeped in the form's history.</p><p>
    
    ""Rex's Blues"" is the re-telling of a song by cult country-rock troubadour Townes Van Zandt. Blakeslee's straight depression-era accompaniment-- from slow guitar-picking to a moaning, despondent fiddle-- makes the track sound like a camp-fire hymn crumpled under the faded lore of histories and proclamations that ""the South will rise again"".  His voice is a high-pitched moan/beg that aches with a sense of dusty misfortune, and is reminiscent of the husky country-folk voacls of Van Zandt contemporary Ry Cooder. As his voice gives way to a rumbling piano, Blakeslee confesses a historic allegiance to the blues but, more importantly, makes them seethe again.</p><p>
    
    On the title track, Blakeslee asks his production crew to dim the lights, setting an appropriate mood for the blistering acoustic blues jam that follows. ""Wandering Stranger"" begins with a simple guitar roll before gaining steam and storming through mournful tambourine hits and Elmore James production. Though it spends a bit too much time repeating its titular phrase, Blakeslee manages to hold your attention with his hypnotic guitar picking and vagabond desperation.</p><p>
    
    At times, Blakeslee mixes the experimental leanings of the Velvet Underground and Tim Buckley into his country-blues, and he does so to mesmerizing effect. ""Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor"" has the same sort of claustrophobic beauty heard on <i>Starsailor</i> or <i>Astral Weeks</i>. Borrowing Buckley's airy, off-key vocals and rumbling spitfire guitar strokes, Blakeslee-- frayed and torn by the sterility of modernity-- perfects the drunken torch song. ""Please Be Careful in New Orleans"" tracks the same dwindling night. Pulsing with release and forlorn grace, its swampy, lovelorn quality contributes as much to the blues as it borrows.</p><p>
    
    Ending with the weathered river-bent jam ""Happy Trails"", Blakeslee closes an album that should delight blues purists and neo-delta enthusiasts alike. His unconventional stylings meld into the time-honored necessities of repetition and stark resurgence with a grace that belies his 23 years.</p></div>"|2911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2911-wandering-stranger/|7.9|Derek Miller

Beneath super-slick production by Mitchell Froom (along with toast-of-Hollywood Jon Brion and Bowie/T. Rex knob-twiddler Tony Visconti) and the Down Under brothers' usual surging melodies, a barely disguised melancholy broods like an evil Finn twin chained up in the basement. The Finns' latest is glossy, emotional, and sure to satisfy longtime listeners-- as well as any Stereophonics or Aqualung fans paying their respects.</p><p>
    
    Tim, the elder Finn, was the first to come to international prominence, fronting clownishly costumed new-wavers Split Enz. Little brother Neil joined up on guitar prior to 1977's <em>Dizrhythmia</em>, and in 1979 his composition ""I Got You"" became the band's breakthrough hit. After garnering MTV airtime with videos like ""Six Months in a Leaky Boat"", the group folded in the mid-1980s. Tim pursued a solo career, while Neil went on to lead Crowded House, whose ""Don't Dream It's Over"" remains as brilliant as it is inoffensive (I'm pretty sure I heard it at a dentist's office once while getting a tooth filled, but I still put it on mix CDs). The brothers reunited for Crowded House's 1991 <em>Woodface</em>, which still stands as their collaborative high watermark; their first album as The Finn Brothers, 1995's <em>Finn</em>, was an exotic, eclectic affair.</p><p>
    
    While not on par with that mid-90s LP, <em>Everyone Is Here</em> combines the skillfully crafted pop effervescence of <em>Woodface</em> and the moodiness of <em>Finn</em>. Opener and first single ""Won't Give In"" is a catchy bit of lite-rock, introducing the gorgeous brotherly harmonies that recur throughout the record. But it also includes lines like ""We all have to die alone"". The song, with its ""Everyone I love is here"" chorus, is both a celebration of life and a middle-age awareness of death's nearness. The Finns' mother died not long before the album's release, and a sense of mortality occasionally manages to leak through Froom's pristine production, lavish strings and all.</p><p>
    
    The sadness floats to the top on ""Edible Flowers"", a mawkish piano ballad that some will surely love. ""Everybody wants the same thing,"" the brothers sing, ""to see another birthday."" Sure, that and an iPod. But the typically swooning chorus, while a touch easy-listening, is lush enough that it renders the sad-eyed lyrics superfluous. The bouncy, overproduced ""Homesick"" could be an anthem for disaffected progressives unable to secure Canadian residency (""Homesick for the country that I'm living in""), but it's really another example of the pathos lurking below the band's popcraft. Closer ""Gentle Hum"" provides four and a half minutes of calm, almost-meditative reflection apropos of the track's name.</p><p>
    
    Not everything here is as seamless as the brothers' interlocking voices. ""All God's Children"" starts off with a fit of garage-y guitar downstrokes (you know, like that one Strokes song) and then engages in a possibly tongue-in-cheek discussion of theogony worthy of Kevin Smith's self-importantly silly <em>Dogma</em>. The bright, earnest ""Anything Can Happen"" is hook-filled enough to be a single, but it and the subsequent love song ""Luckiest Man Alive"" rarely go past the cliches of their refrains (much like Mick Jagger's new ""Old Habits Die Hard""). You'd think lifelong songwriters would be able to come up with titles that hadn't already been used by Air Supply, in Jagger's case, and <em>World In Motion</em>-era Jackson Browne, for the Finns.</p><p>
    
    The album is at its best when the brothers' knack for pop melodies meets subject matter that is poignant, not maudlin or even merely sufficient. ""Disembodied Voices"" fulfills this album's promise, reminiscing about brotherhood, childhood, and harmony. That's what <em>Everyone Is Here</em> is really about. Again, from the opener: ""Everyone I love is here/ Play it once, then we disappear."" Darkness might be gathering somewhere, but loved ones can always gather together and raise their voices above the din to achieve a brief, transitory, but undeniable peace. Even if that means sounding like late-period Wings.</p></div>"|3330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3330-everyone-is-here/|6.7|Marc Hogan

From the musclebound Joe Weider plank snapper to the wizened loose-cannon drunk or the free-swinging pro athlete, they're just different versions of the same uninteresting dolt. That's why English louts often seen more interesting to us Americans than our homegrown ones. Buoyed by football, illicit drugs, and lager-- or the remnants of mid-90s lad culture in general-- these types often take an elemental approach to bad behavior. They integrate torrents of entertaining drunk speak into fistfights both won and lost; they're boastful, prideful, or just plain full. They're going to live fast and die young, but not until after the kebab shops close.</p><p>
    
    Kasabian is the latest UK outfit to tap into this bravado conduit, and as they've shown over singles ranging back to the beginning of 2004 (all of which appear on this self-titled debut LP), the Leicester combo likes their hedonism a la carte. ""Processed Beats"" apes shamelessly the shambolic beat and double-tracked lead vocals of vintage Stone Roses, ""L.S.F. [Lost Souls Forever]"" is a sly and seamy ride through the hybridist sonic absurdism of Lo Fidelity Allstars, and ""Butcher Blues"" is another version of Swinging London revisionism with its hazy dissolves, tube station announcement vocals, and head-nodding electronic percussion. Each of these songs possess that certain kinetic fizz that makes a great single. The strutting Mani-istic bass of ""Processed"", ""L.S.F.""'s handclaps, hip-hop breaks, and soaring chorus (""Come on! We got our backs to the wall!"")-- in its best moments, Kasabian is the soundtrack to the slow-motion Guy Ritchie movie inside every lad's head.</p><p>
    
    That quality makes ""Club Foot""'s tensely barbed guitar perfect for punching faces to. And yet, its initial rush dissipates. Like the harsh house lights of the pub at closing time, the groove can't go on forever-- especially when it eventually starts to morph into every Primal Scream song you've ever heard. That's where <i>Kasabian</i> begins to waver. It's a catchy and energizing Friday evening record that draws from its sources well, but seems to have had some staying power sapped by the spliffs. It drags in places and sags in others. ""U Boat"" tries for layered organic and electronic bliss but drifts distractedly into a wispy Beta Band mess. ""I.D."" doesn't go anywhere we haven't been before, either. Once its thumping beat and lilting synthesizer surge has transported us back to the Hacienda, <i>Kasabian</i> fades in favor of some old Happy Mondays records.</p><p>
<i>Kasabian</i> is brash, loutish, and seems liable at times to cut you; the consistent kick drum beat throughout it is like a great party's heartbeat. But like the roustabout in the corner, drinking all the lager and scratching up your old records, it can be more loudmouthed than substantial.</p></div>"|4588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4588-kasabian/|5.2|Johnny Loftus

    tracks of mono, compressing them and then adding some reverb.  (i.e., these aren't actual ""stereo"" performances, but ""duophonic."")<br/>
</li></ol>
    E. The albums are presented in miniature replicas of the original LP jackets.<br/>
</ul></p><p>
    
    II. Is it worthwhile for Beatle fanatics?  Casual fans?</p><p>
<ul>
    A. Since most fans have owned the British versions of the Beatles' albums for years, this set is most valuable to American fans who
    lived through Beatlemania, or as a curio to the rest of us.<br/>
    B. The packaging seems hastily assembled.  The CDs don't even come in inner sleeves, so they always fall out when you pick them up.<br/>
    C. Casual fans would be better off sticking to the British albums (on EMI), as they contain most of this music in superior mixes.
    They also have the notable characteristic of being the records the Beatles wanted to make, unlike these Capitol-assembled compilations.<br/>
    D. Nobody really needs to own ""Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand"" twice-- owning the <i>Past Masters</i> sets takes care of all the non-album
    singles, and the British albums have the rest.<br/>
</ul></p><p>
    
    III. Do the stereo mixes sound good?</p><p>
<ul>
    A. Remember, it's ""duophonic,"" not stereo.  The <i>Pet Sounds</i> reissue from a few years ago is a much better example of presenting
    in stereo an album that was originally released in mono.<br/>
    B. The Capitol mixes are filled with reverb.  This gets annoying after a while, because all the vocals sound cavernous.<br/>
    C. That said, the instrumental tracks are clearer.<br/>
</ul></p><p>
    
    IV. Why did they only do this for these albums, and not the rest of the catalog?</p><p>
<ul>
    A. The existing Beatles' CD catalog hasn't been remastered because there is no need.<br/>
<ol>
<li> The sound is good, especially considering when they were remastered (1987).<br/>
</li><li> They still sell well.  There's no need to fix what isn't broken.<br/>
</li></ol>
    B. That said, I'd love to hear a 24-bit treatment of the Beatles' records.  Few bands deserve to be heard in optimal sound more than
    them.<br/>
</ul></p><p>
    
    V. How do the individual albums hold up?</p><p>
<ul>
    A. <i>Meet the Beatles</i><br/>
<ol>
<li> There isn't a bad song on this record, with the possible exception of McCartney's ""Hold Me Tight"", which lacks a good melody, and
    features some of the least interesting lyrics in the Beatles' canon (""Hold me tight/ Tell me I'm the only one/ And then I might/ Never
    be the lonely one""?  D'oh!).<br/>
</li><li> Leading off with ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""I Saw Her Standing There"" leads to a slightly anti-climactic experience for the
    remainder of the record. <br/>
</li><li> I can't imagine ever listening to the mono versions of these songs again.  But then, I can't really imagine playing these albums
    much anyway.<br/>
</li></ol>
    B. <i>The Beatles' Second Album</i><br/>
<ol>
<li> Alright, that's not fair.  There is some historical value to hearing this stuff.  So, go history.<br/>
</li><li> ""She Loves You"" is still one of my favorite Beatles singles.<br/>
</li><li> Cover version war: Lennon singing ""Money"" and ""Please Mr. Postman"" towers over McCartney's ""Long Tall Sally"" and Harrison's ""Roll
    Over Beethoven"".  However, just like the British edition of <i>Beatles for Sale</i> (1964), this album seems overrun with covers.<br/>
</li></ol>
    C. <i>Something New</i><br/>
<ol>
<li> Now we're getting good: ""Things We Said Today"" and ""If I Fell"" are two of the best pre-<i>Rubber Soul</i> Beatle songs.  ""And I
    Love Her"" also nods to the direction the band would take starting in 1965.<br/>
</li><li> And yet, Capitol thought ""Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand"" complimented them well.<br/>
</li><li> Still, this seems like the most thoughtfully compiled of the Capitol albums.<br/>
</li></ol>
    D. <i>Beatles '65</i><br/>
<ol>
<li> And this is the most haphazardly compiled.  ""I'm a Loser"", ""No Reply"", and ""I'll Follow the Sun"" stand up to the best early Beatles
    songs, but seem out of place on a record featuring ""Rock and Roll Music"", ""Mr. Moonlight"", and ""Honey Don't"".<br/>
</li><li> ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby"" has more reverb than any song I've ever heard.  Okay, maybe not more than that last Acid Mothers
    Temple album, but close.<br/>
</li><li> Capitol kept releasing different versions of the Beatles' records until <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i> in 1967.  According to some, the Beatles protested in
    1966 by delivering the infamous ""butchered baby"" cover photo for <i>Yesterday... And Today</i>.  If Capitol put that in the next box,
    I'd give an extra point just on principle.<br/>
</li></ol></ul></p><p>
    
    VI. Anything else?</p><p>
<ul>
    Not really.  I'm giving this a 6 because while there's a lot of great music here, there's very little incentive for me to play it,
    and none of these albums compare favorably to their British counterparts.  Oh well.  Next up: McCartney's ready for some football.<br/>

Never mind your musical acumen-- what else would you do? This is how Swell Maps formed in 1972: six kids in their early teens calling themselves Sacred Mushroom and fancying themselves a band-- in spite of the fact that they never gigged or recorded until 1977, after punk broke and they realized they could get studio time. Even then, Swell Maps were anything but a conventional band. They were officially a sextet but they recorded with whomever happened to be in the studio at the moment.

<p>Of course, we're also talking about a band that didn't bother rehearsing, began writing their own songs because they couldn't play anyone else's, thought prog and punk were equally great in 1978, and cited Gerry Anderson's television puppet shows ""Thunderbirds"" and ""Stingray"" as equal influences to Can and T. Rex. They recorded a huge amount of material between 1977 and 1980, but only released two proper albums and a handful of maxi singles in their time together-- out of a sense of obligation, they actually finished recording their second LP after they had broken up.</p>
<p>Considering their strange story, it's hardly a wonder that the two albums Swell Maps cut are as weird and wonderful as they are. The two records-- 1979's <i>A Trip to Marineville</i> (the title was taken from an episode of ""Stingray"") and 1980's <i>Jane From Occupied Europe</i>-- are nothing if not consistent. In the case of Swell Maps, that means consistently manic, unfocused, chaotic, uniquely unprofessional, and quite charming. There aren't any other records from the post-punk era that sound quite like these-- Television Personalities' <i>And Don't the Kids Just Love it</i> comes close for cheekiness, but doesn't match them sonically-- and the reckless abandon and spontaneity of the band and producer John Rivers shines brightly and brilliantly on these remasters. Not that hi-fi sound was ever central to the Swell Maps experience, but it certainly doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>Separating the albums contextually, one could say that <i>Marineville</i> is more song-oriented and <i>Jane</i> is more jam-centered. That's correct, to a point. The fact is that both albums veer erratically from bursts of eccentric punk and (probably inebriated) harmony vocals into nightmarish noise concoctions, offering catchy psych-punk nuggets almost as an excuse for the improvised scrapings that surround them. Principle vocalist Nikki Sudden sounds like he thinks the band could have a hit on the relatively accessible and melodic ""Another Song"" and ""Spitfire Parade"", but the band also veer far into leftfield on squalls of loosely sculptured sound such as ""Adventuring into Basketry"" and ""Big Maz in the Desert"".</p>
<p>Really, it's a lot to take in-- the band don't even seem to realize the havoc that their meandering Can/surf/industrial/found object instrumentals and jarring sequencing can visit upon the listener, so it's best to just sit back and take it all in stride. What sounds like a mess when you think too much about it reveals its own internal logic when you let the charm of Epic Soundtracks' wild drum fills and the band's drinking-song harmonies work their magic. There are also surprising moments of beauty, like the strangely poignant piano piece ""Don't Throw Ashtrays at Me!"", which features the recorded mutterings of band members, or the haunting ""Trans-Europe Express"" synth line that rises out of nowhere in the droning punk song ""Cake Shop Girl"".</p>
<p>But by all means, if you have any interest in the original post-punk era, do take it all in, because Swell Maps were one of the most unique pieces of Britain's great late-70s musical puzzle.

The first is more probable (Occam's Razor and all that): They liked how it sounded. The second is unlikely, but too ingenious to ignore. Consider this scenario: Turing Machine read music criticism and glean that the field is crowded with pedants. They realize that the name ""Turing Machine"" might distinguish them from the math-rock pack and sway reviews in their favor. Sure enough, bylined sophists hit the Internet for descriptions of the machine, catching wind of a brainy metaphor for Turing Machine's music that will also justify the most self-gratifying, highfalutin prose. They expound upon its qualities as if they've been intimately familiar with them since birth, so nonchalantly that you might even think they're building one in their garage.</p><p>
    
    The sneaky part is that after you've spent a couple paragraphs linking a band's music to an arcane invention, particularly one whose inventor is synonymous with genius, it's almost impossible to speak poorly of them. It wouldn't serve the concept. I doubt Turing Machine had any of this in mind, but you never know...</p><p>
    
    Lucky for you, Reader, I don't know much of anything about Turing machines. I do understand that they're more like algorithms-- abstract computational devices-- than actual machines, and they certainly couldn't be constructed in a garage or any other physical location. Happily, my ignorance saves us all from having to slog through a lot of hubris about drums as tape cells and guitars as read-write heads or whatever.</p><p>
    
    The cumbersome analogy would be doubly unnecessary given that <em>Zwei</em>-- unlike Turing Machine's colder and mathier debut, <em>A New Machine for Living</em>-- patly describes itself. It retains Turing Machine's technical acumen while funneling it into more bodily pleasures. Math rock finds purchase in the analytical mind, which admires it from a clinical remove, but the primal throb of <em>Zwei</em> occurs in the nerve endings, in the skin.</p><p>
    
    After the demise of their math-rock band Pitchblende, Justin Chearno and Scott DeSimon teamed with Vineland drummer Gerard Fuchs to form Turing Machine. Chearno also plays in the incendiary party-punk act Panthers, but barring the occasional choppy bass line, Turing Machine has more in common with Pitchblende's unhinged skronk. At least their first album did. The superior <em>Zwei</em> relies more upon the narcotic repetition and swirling psychedelia of Krautrock icons like Can than elaborate meters.</p><p>
    
    Like Turing Machine's debut, <em>Zwei</em> is a seven-track full-length that primarily features tracks ranging from mid-sized epics to full-blown 13-minute opuses. There are no vocals, which might be a deal-breaker for those of you who swore off instrumental indie-prog after Don Cab called it quits. It was all the rage in the '90s, but as musicians realized that complexity can substitue for good songwriting, the genre became at once clogged and diluted. <em>Zwei</em>, by insinuating a steady pulse into its musical gymnastics, seems to slightly rejuvenate it.</p><p>
    
    ""Bleach It Black"" features the galloping drums and tight post-punk bass preferred by Panthers, with long, gleaming sheets of tremulously melodic, late Les Savy Fav-ish guitar leads, and dense volleys of overdriven chords. The whorls of bass and guitar on ""Bitte, Baby, Bitte"" are articulations of melodic friction, creating a rippling, lustrous surface that shifts between serrated topography and plateaued reverberation. And the rigid new wave stomp of ""Don't Mind If I Don't"" is tempered by staccato chords and questing soloing (<em>so</em> Seth Jabour, down to the guitar-as-synth tone and sprint / glide structure); like most of the record, its relentless linearity evokes rapid motion through bright and colorful spaces.</p><p>
    
    Every town has at least one band-- often including a few bookish fellows and one fat, sweaty dude-- whose sets seem more like gear expos than performances, the indie equivalents to guys who ride around town playing bass-test sequences on their customized stereo systems. No wonder the genre gets a bad rap. But enjoying <em>Zwei</em> requires no specialized knowledge of chromatic chords or alternate tunings. It's a prolonged melodic roar that mystifies without obscuring-- a clean, lambent line of power and nuance.</p></div>"|8191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8191-zwei/|7.3|Brian Howe

The famed producer's canny, famously intense production is well suited to the group's characteristically dense, distortion-smeared instrumental surges. Mono needed the boost, too: Crescendo-heavy orchestral post-rock has been spread paper thin for the better part of a decade, and the band's previous album, <i>One Step More and You Die</i>, walked already well-trod territory. In an overextended genre-- one that values sonic evolution and unique sounds-- mere competency just isn't good enough, so the follow up to <i>One Step</i> would likely be a sink-or-swim affair.</p><p>
    
    Counter-intuitively, Albini's production has dramatically subdued Mono's sound. The band's crashing waves of guitar and stereo-shattering post-rock barrages have been limited to a handful of tracks. In their place are more delicate, introspective compositions, which theoretically should expand the band's potential; in practice, however, they hinder it. The album begins promisingly enough: On the thoughtful, understated ""16.12"", Mono slowly and methodically layer guitar distortion and insistent, thundering percussion upon a backdrop of delicate strings, bass patterns, and washes of cymbal-- overwhelming the track in oppressive noise. The simple tension/release model is surprisingly effective, in part because Albini's crisp production distinguishes each instrumental element while still retaining the appealing impenetrability of the band's dense construction.</p><p>
    
    On the rest of the album the band mostly forgoes its trademark deafening climaxes in favor of fragile atmospheric pieces. One exception is the powerful ""Halcyon (Beautiful Days)"", whose unexpected mid-song wall-of-guitar explosion is a surprise highlight. Tracks such as ""Ode"" and ""Mere Your Pathetique Light"", however, develop unadorned guitar figures into adept Godspeed warm-ups without any payoffs, while ""2 Candles, 1 Wish"" offers a memorable piano/guitar melody, but sputters out in less than three minutes. The indistinguishable orchestral muddle of the title track is also brief; it's an unnecessary interlude on an album already weighed down with meandering atmospheric filler.</p><p>
    
    The dense rush of ""Lost Snow"" and bittersweet closing ballad ""A Thousand Paper Cranes""-- based on the story of Sadako, a young Hiroshima victim who attempted to overcome her leukemia by superstitiously crafting hundreds of origami cranes-- can't fully relieve the album's tedious predictability. ""Crane""'s simple piano foundation seems relatively uninspired, particularly given the emotional heft of the song's inspiration. Mono have wisely restrained from directly replicating their previous sound, but here the band has sacrificed sonic heaviness for intellectual ponderousness, and too often has fallen prey to slow, repetitive, tiresome songwriting patterns and a frustrating lack of variation.</p></div>"|5404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5404-walking-cloud-deep-red-sky-flag-fluttered-and-the-sun-shined/|6.6|David Moore

Maybe I made the trip to remind myself that there are still bands worth making big, expensive trips for; maybe I was just excited for the experience of watching the band in person. The quartet plays completely improvised music that's wrestled into shape by four distinct musicians; on record, it's difficult to tell how the players interact. At the show, I felt like a car-illiterate driver popping his hood just to stare at the engine: I wanted to watch the pieces working together, even if I wouldn't know what was going on inside of them.</p>
<p>If Supersilent has a frontman, it's Arve Henriksen, who sat on stage between keyboardists and noise generators Ståle Storløkken and Helge Sten. In addition to playing trumpet into one of two mics (one had more distortion than the other), Henriksen also sings wordlessly, high and close to how I'd imagine an adult castrati would sound. Unlike a chamber singer, he sounds untrained, airy, and wholly naked: a broken plea stops your breath.</p>
<p>Henriksen has rarely used his voice on recordings with Supersilent, but it becomes a crucial instrument on his new solo disc, <i>Chiaroscuro</i>. After working in monk-like solitude on his first album, <i>Sakuteiki</i> (""a treatise on garden making""), he collaborates on <i>Chiaroscuro</i> with two notable Norwegian musicians, percussionist Audun Kleive and sound artist Jan Bang. The thick but passive atmosphere they create warmly blankets Henriksen's trumpet and vocals.</p>
<p>The album's most striking moment is its first track, ""Opening Image"". After a trumpet performance on which he struggles for breath-- making the brass instrument sound almost like a reed or a bamboo flute-- Henriksen emits a pure cry. It's such a personal revelation that you'd think professional training would ruin him-- not because it would strip away his beauty but because you'd know what to expect from note to note, and that would ruin the importance of his telling it to you.</p>
<p><i>Chiaroscuro</i> could have been a late '70s ECM date-- from Kleive's ambiguously world influences to the enveloping moods to the sameness of the songwriting. It's so obviously beautiful that you don't feel challenged but right when you drift off, it creeps up on you: Kleive plays an inventive pattern-- for example, the hand drums on ""Parallel Action""-- or a melody starts to sink in. If the album had more variety or used these fragile-sounding elements less cautiously, this would be an exceptional session.</p>
<p>At the concert, Henriksen also revealed a rougher side, first singing garbled scat vocals into his trumpet, and then using actual words, which was unexpected from an act as abstract as Supersilent. During a skronky noise piece, Henriksen screamed at us about the recent election: ""OHIO! OHIO! WHY?! MOTHERFUCKER!"" It may have grounded the musical flights but in blue state-housed Frisco, everyone loved it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ståle Storløkken almost disappointed me. On the Supersilent albums, it's hard to separate Storløkken's contributions from Sten's. He usually reveals himself by playing melodic synth lines while Sten sticks to brutally neutralizing tones that can raze any assertion down to an ambiguous grey. Storløkken is more colorful, so in this context he risks being banal by trumping the band's subtle compromises: His loudest riffs on <i>6</i>-- the solos on ""6.1"" and the dominating statement that ends ""6.4""-- suit the pieces, but just barely. In concert, Storløkken locked in brilliantly with Sten when they played loudly but in the slow sections, he almost started to noodle-- to play lines that were merely pretty.</p>
<p>But maybe I had an eye on him because I had just heard <i>Humcrush</i>, his new duet with drummer Thomas Strønen (Food). <i>Humcrush</i> gallops like a circus-- the first track is called ""Acrobat""-- and it doesn't mind easy gestures: For example, the track called ""Japan"" sounds stereotypically Japanese. Both men use electronics to generate layers of beats, with Strønen adding rhythms that sound like playing cards on a window fan, but the live (in the studio) recording keeps even the densest textures frantic.</p>
<p>I love Storløkken's signature analog synth, even though every time I hear it I picture a little plastic spaceship being pulled across a movie screen on a wire; when Storløkken deploys it, he smears fusion-like lines across the top, while at others times-- like ""Sport'n Spice""-- he uses a quick, digital jabbing sound to grapple head-on with Strønen. While different moods emerge, <i>Humcrush</i> is one of the least reflective discs in the Rune Grammofon catalog: It breezes by instead of lingering, which is not a bad thing when you're listening to such proficient musicians dance each other in knots.</p>
<p>Henriksen, Storløkken, and Helge Sten (as Deathprod) all released solo or duet records this year, and while each one has its strengths, Supersilent remains greater than the sum of their parts. The unique tension between their players creates something unique and frequently awesome. The humanistic, almost New Age-y Henriksen and the grimly neutral Sten especially become stronger when their different approaches are at odds with one another.

Maybe I made the trip to remind myself that there are still bands worth making big, expensive trips for; maybe I was just excited for the experience of watching the band in person. The quartet plays completely improvised music that's wrestled into shape by four distinct musicians; on record, it's difficult to tell how the players interact. At the show, I felt like a car-illiterate driver popping his hood just to stare at the engine: I wanted to watch the pieces working together, even if I wouldn't know what was going on inside of them.</p>
<p>If Supersilent has a frontman, it's Arve Henriksen, who sat on stage between keyboardists and noise generators Ståle Storløkken and Helge Sten. In addition to playing trumpet into one of two mics (one had more distortion than the other), Henriksen also sings wordlessly, high and close to how I'd imagine an adult castrati would sound. Unlike a chamber singer, he sounds untrained, airy, and wholly naked: a broken plea stops your breath.</p>
<p>Henriksen has rarely used his voice on recordings with Supersilent, but it becomes a crucial instrument on his new solo disc, <i>Chiaroscuro</i>. After working in monk-like solitude on his first album, <i>Sakuteiki</i> (""a treatise on garden making""), he collaborates on <i>Chiaroscuro</i> with two notable Norwegian musicians, percussionist Audun Kleive and sound artist Jan Bang. The thick but passive atmosphere they create warmly blankets Henriksen's trumpet and vocals.</p>
<p>The album's most striking moment is its first track, ""Opening Image"". After a trumpet performance on which he struggles for breath-- making the brass instrument sound almost like a reed or a bamboo flute-- Henriksen emits a pure cry. It's such a personal revelation that you'd think professional training would ruin him-- not because it would strip away his beauty but because you'd know what to expect from note to note, and that would ruin the importance of his telling it to you.</p>
<p><i>Chiaroscuro</i> could have been a late '70s ECM date-- from Kleive's ambiguously world influences to the enveloping moods to the sameness of the songwriting. It's so obviously beautiful that you don't feel challenged but right when you drift off, it creeps up on you: Kleive plays an inventive pattern-- for example, the hand drums on ""Parallel Action""-- or a melody starts to sink in. If the album had more variety or used these fragile-sounding elements less cautiously, this would be an exceptional session.</p>
<p>At the concert, Henriksen also revealed a rougher side, first singing garbled scat vocals into his trumpet, and then using actual words, which was unexpected from an act as abstract as Supersilent. During a skronky noise piece, Henriksen screamed at us about the recent election: ""OHIO! OHIO! WHY?! MOTHERFUCKER!"" It may have grounded the musical flights but in blue state-housed Frisco, everyone loved it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ståle Storløkken almost disappointed me. On the Supersilent albums, it's hard to separate Storløkken's contributions from Sten's. He usually reveals himself by playing melodic synth lines while Sten sticks to brutally neutralizing tones that can raze any assertion down to an ambiguous grey. Storløkken is more colorful, so in this context he risks being banal by trumping the band's subtle compromises: His loudest riffs on <i>6</i>-- the solos on ""6.1"" and the dominating statement that ends ""6.4""-- suit the pieces, but just barely. In concert, Storløkken locked in brilliantly with Sten when they played loudly but in the slow sections, he almost started to noodle-- to play lines that were merely pretty.</p>
<p>But maybe I had an eye on him because I had just heard <i>Humcrush</i>, his new duet with drummer Thomas Strønen (Food). <i>Humcrush</i> gallops like a circus-- the first track is called ""Acrobat""-- and it doesn't mind easy gestures: For example, the track called ""Japan"" sounds stereotypically Japanese. Both men use electronics to generate layers of beats, with Strønen adding rhythms that sound like playing cards on a window fan, but the live (in the studio) recording keeps even the densest textures frantic.</p>
<p>I love Storløkken's signature analog synth, even though every time I hear it I picture a little plastic spaceship being pulled across a movie screen on a wire; when Storløkken deploys it, he smears fusion-like lines across the top, while at others times-- like ""Sport'n Spice""-- he uses a quick, digital jabbing sound to grapple head-on with Strønen. While different moods emerge, <i>Humcrush</i> is one of the least reflective discs in the Rune Grammofon catalog: It breezes by instead of lingering, which is not a bad thing when you're listening to such proficient musicians dance each other in knots.</p>
<p>Henriksen, Storløkken, and Helge Sten (as Deathprod) all released solo or duet records this year, and while each one has its strengths, Supersilent remains greater than the sum of their parts. The unique tension between their players creates something unique and frequently awesome. The humanistic, almost New Age-y Henriksen and the grimly neutral Sten especially become stronger when their different approaches are at odds with one another. But together or by themselves, live or on record, the members of Supersilent still have more to reveal, more corners they haven't explored. Hell, next time I might even fly to Oslo.</p></div>"|11836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11836-chiaroscuro-humcrush/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

And that might be why the four silhouettes currently twitching across America's TV screens, jerkily promoting U2-branded iPods over big, neon expanses, seem so eerily apropos: the flesh and blood members of U2 have been reduced to signifiers, mock-ups, representatives. They are bigger than their band.</p><p>
    
    Produced by arena-guru Steve Lillywhite (with help from longtime twiddlers Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Flood), U2's 11th LP, <i>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</i>, is brash, grungy, and loud-- everything R.E.M. tried (and failed) to be on <i>Monster</i>, and everything U2 opted out of being on 2000's <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i>. Still, <i>Atomic Bomb</i> is not an especially surprising record. It's a classic mix of colossal ballads and jerky rockers-- part-<i>The Unforgettable Fire</i>, part-<i>Achtung Baby</i>. Theoretically, <i>Atomic Bomb</i> weds classic U2 (echoing guitars, big sound, soaring vocals) with nu-U2 (experimental tweaks, electronic flourishes) but, high aspirations aside, the only marriage the record ultimately achieves is the union of good U2 and bad U2. So take a deep breath and prepare for a tiny handful of outstanding tracks and a whole mess of schmaltzy filler.</p><p>
    
    U2 may be a staunchly democratic machine (ask Eno), but Bono is still singularly responsible for propelling U2-as-uber-group forward, leering out from behind oversized yellow goggles, crusading righteously to reduce Third World debt, campaigning against AIDS, spitting post-Beat induction speeches from Jann Wenner's Hall of Fame podium, bobbing stupidly for Apple, talking and talking and talking about himself. Publicly, U2 are overblown and decadent, sporting silly, abstract monikers and booking colossal stadium tours, calling presidents, wearing sunglasses in the dark, anchoring the Super Bowl, pushing products. Bono is 43 years old, boasts remarkable sway both inside and outside the pop culture sphere, and fronts one of the most universally recognizable rock bands of all time: He is a neo-superstar-- global, important, impossibly entertaining, and forever tiptoeing the line between wholly extraordinary and idiotically self-obsessed.</p><p>
    
    Despite a deliberately leading album title-- and one lone, overtly suggestive song title (""Love and Peace Or Else"")-- <i>How to Dismantle An Atomic Bomb</i> is a curiously apolitical record, more about love and loyalty (and the 2001 death of Bono's father) than impending global doom. The decision to sidestep bold politicking and instead highlight feelings-and-guitars is a particularly compelling one right now, given the super-charged months preceding the record's release (and the melange of global conflicts now escalating to new levels of absurdity). Listeners are left wondering if Bono's elbows-deep international activism has somehow turned him off to the (comparably nebulous) effort of writing protest songs-- has all the dirt under his fingernails made the act of emoting into a microphone seem a little less urgent? ""Saving the world is now a daily chore,"" Bono joked to <i>The New York Times</i>-- even in jest, it's a completely ridiculous thing to say. And yet?</p><p>
    
    Deliberately or not, Bono-as-bespectacled-celebrity-crusader seeps into nearly everything U2 does, sometimes to significant aesthetic effect: When Bono starts cawing urgently about a place called ""Vertigo"", declaring it ""everything I wish I didn't know,"" it's possible that he's talking about girls or his father or his band-- or Bono might be squealing about something far worse, something awful, something most of us are lucky enough to have never witnessed. The problem is that it's extraordinarily difficult to ever really know exactly what Bono is talking about. Almost without exception, Bono yowls vague, cliched observations, his sentiments always awkwardly bombastic or hopelessly maudlin (check ""Miracle Drug,"" where we are invited to ponder how ""Freedom has a scent/ Like the top of a newborn baby's head,"" or ""A Man and A Woman"", where we contemplate ""the mysterious distance between a man and a woman,"" or even just repeated-- seriously!-- ""Where is the love?"" demands.)</p><p>
    
    Loads of listeners have already noted that opener ""Vertigo"" bears an odd resemblance to The Supremes' gorgeously desperate ""You Keep Me Hanging On"", except ""Vertigo"" is framed by a classic punk shout-down where-- get this!-- Bono's totally singing in Spanish! Wait, he said catorce! It's a classic U2 moment: worldly, frantic, irritatingly deliberate. But when the Edge slams into his guitar, hollering a smirky ""Hola!"" to Bono's quasi-confrontational ""Hello, hello!"" it's awfully easy to forgive: ""Vertigo"" is hopelessly appealing, somehow growing less stupid and more compelling with each listen.</p><p>
    
    ""Vertigo"" is followed by a pair of swirly half-ballads, the plodding, overblown ""Miracle Drug"" and the super-sappy ""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"", before we're mercifully handed ""Love and Peace Or Else"", a snarly, throbbing bit of solace. ""Love and Peace"" opens with a platter of ominous noise, shaky guitar grumbles rubbing up against high-pitched whines. Drums rumble, and Bono lodges his best semi-seductive demand: ""Lay down, lay down."" ""Love and Peace"" is chased by the equally exhilarating ""City of Blinding Lights"", an earnest and galactic fight song, and the sort of track that's best enjoyed in cars and airplanes, simply because it encites so much giddy movement. But ""City of Blinding Lights"" is the record's climax, and <i>How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb</i> begins its gnawing descent almost immediately, culminating with disastrous closer ""Yahweh"", a whiny, monotonous mess that's easily one of the worst songs U2 have ever recorded.</p><p>
    
    Maybe the biggest problem with <i>Atomic Bomb</i> is just that it sounds so much like U2, and their semi-absurd, totally unparalleled ubiquity has left all of us just a tiny bit tired of listening to things that sound like U2. This isn't completely their fault-- they tried to change (see the questionable <i>Zooropa</i> or the disastrous <i>Pop</i>), and we didn't like that, either. Bono has talked publicly about U2's longevity and quasi-diversity, crediting their shape-shifting to his band's unbreakable internal bonds-- U2 can afford to mess around, because the ""spirit"" of the band is so strong, so infinitely recognizable. But maybe U2's immortality is also their biggest curse-- and now they're forced to wallow in superstardom, forever perpetuating their own colossal myth.</p></div>"|8330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8330-how-to-dismantle-an-atomic-bomb/|6.9|Amanda Petrusich

Why bother with presents? 2005's Tickle Me Elmo was supposed to be a chicken-legged Sri Lankan with so much sex in her self-spun neons you might as well get wasted off penicillin with Willie Nelson at a secret Rex the Dog show.  But guess what?  On Halloween she showed up in Philadelphia for her <i>Fader</i> gig, sat herself under a big fucking Christmas tree, and dished out free copies of <i>Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1</i>, the mixtape masterpiece she and Diplo Hollertronix had spent the 10 previous days putting together in his apartment. Batteries included!</p>
<p>So a large portion of her forthcoming debut, <i>Arular</i>, has willfully gone leaky boat here.  Many of her tracks sound similar to one another: A 505 Groovebox queefs out splatty, farty beats and M.I.A. shouts lyrics of varying snark over them, sometimes even singing them.  (Sometimes.)  She's been irresistible in single land, but M.I.A.'s full-length runs the risk of seeming limited and discrediting her misleading but awesome ""female Dizzee Rascal"" tag, replacing that description with ""Neneh Cherry, Mk. II""-- a label that has likely dawned on anyone who has seen the ""Buffalo Stance""-like ""Galang"" video.</p>
<p>That is why this mixtape kills: The format fits M.I.A. perfectly. Her songs benefit greatly from Diplo's recent baile funk fetish (confer his recent <i>Favela On Blast</i> tape), some choice dub and American hip-hop cuts to break up the blaze to blaze and razorblades, and some flat-out brilliant mashups.</p>
<p>On the upstroke, ""Galang"" goes reggaeton; on the down, Diplo cops the song a Lil Vicious beat and a lil keyboard hook, and it's so whoa you'll have to punch yourself in the face to stop smiling.  ""Fire Fire"" goes bam bam then walks like an Egyptian in a telling Bangles mashup-- the two songs play so nicely together they could be siamese, until Diplo misdemeans ""Pass That Dutch"" with M.I.A.'s snakey music box schwarma.  M.I.A.'s ""Amazon"" coupled with Ciara's radio-friendly microcrunk squelch is an early highlight, though that squirmy synth on Clipse's ""Definition of a Roller"" makes for good freak, too, packing just enough snaggletooth funk to forgive those recent Neptunes missteps.</p>
<p>For a tape whose initial appeal was the instant and gratifying relief it brought to everyone waiting for M.I.A.'s full-length, Diplo ironically saves M.I.A.'s best cuts for last.  ""URAQT"" is a jittery mess of flirting, territory-marking, and text-messaging (!): ""You fuckin with my man and you text him all the time/ You mighta had him once but I have him all the time,"" and later, ""U-R-A-Q-T/ Is your daddy dealer, cause you're dope to me!""  For dessert, Diplo brings ""Big Pimpin'"" out of retirement to back M.I.A.'s raspy ""Bingo"": ""Do you know what is on?  Do you know what is on?  Do you know how this beat is made in fucking Lon-d-d-don?""  The song's obviously great, but between M.I.A.'s fierce deliveries and the braggart beat, it sounds weird and ominous, a black-hole closer to an album brimming with life.</p>
<p>Last week, Sasha Frere-Jones profiled M.I.A. in <i>The New Yorker</i>, spraypainting her as a consummate and naturally ""world"" artist. M.I.A. is silly, dancey, cheap, expensive, truthful, and utterly serious all at once-- just like the world (!). She's not exactly rags-to-riches (yet), but her pop carries unwittingly significant weight, and to potentially far more people than just a few hundred ecstatic MP3 blog readers.  It's one thing for M.I.A. to be a ""world"" pop star; it will be another thing for her to release an album that reflects that backstory.  For now, <i>Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1</i> takes that burden off of <i>Arular</i>: Diplo has actualized our hopes for M.I.A. qua world pop star, and we didn't even have to leave him cookies.</p></div>"|5617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5617-piracy-funds-terrorism-vol-1/|8.5|Nick Sylvester

Many other underground luminaries had already connected Dirty South crunk with the cubist contortions of Autechre and Mouse on Mars: Push Button Objects, Funkstorung, Otto Von Schirach, and Jimmy Edgar, to name a few. Deriding these artists for plagiarizing each other's ideas would be remiss. It would be like rejecting the entire generation of 60s Anglo blues geeks who mimicked (some say bastardized) the harmonics and attitudes of their Chess 45s.</p><p>
    
    That said, <i>Bidnezz</i>-- the fourth albun from Machine Drum's Travis Stewart-- could sound to some like a collection of <i>One Word Extinguisher</i> b-sides. However, Stewart's record has more breathing space than and a tunefulness that seems missing in Prefuse 73's beat obsession. Plus, Stewart already made his name in glitch-hop with the 2001 milestone, <i>Now You Know</i>, which was released months before many critics sold Herren as indie hip-hop's reason for living.</p><p>
<i>Bidnezz</i> is a continuation of the haphazard rhythms and poetics that Stewart toyed with on his previous album, <i>Urban Biology</i>, but without that record's cavity-grinding sentimentality. Soulful moments like ""Time Turned Over Itself"" resemble cool-jazz/R&amp;B; soundtracks for auto malls or mutual fund commercials whose satellite transmissions got frayed in the Earth's shattered ozone layer. It's an ace noise.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Entrau"" is a throat-clearing introduction that loops a keyboard ring from the ""dream sequence"" of some kiddie TV show. Right before the ecstasy rubs salt in the ear, the amputated crunk of ""Disa Bling"" hobbles in. There, female ""eh's"" are ricocheted between a muttering background and a shouting foreground, while some distracting dub organ vamps are thrown in for good measure. ""$$legs"" brims with AM static-clogged, hip-hop thuds that sink a Holiday Inn lounge piano tune.</p><p>
    
    And then arrives ""Babbling"", a diarrheal DSP release of scrambled voices from the dead. Stewart, bless his mortal soul, disrupts the album's groove with such abrupt tracks of whooshing musique concrete repellant like ""Worldcomin"", ""Wiggle"", and the vile ""Badgerman"". The digitally incomprehensible recording of homeys bragging about their Dirty South beats in ""Hipsteos"" almost qualifies, but at least it's about something.</p><p>
    
    Meaningful discord also graces the album's highlights-- Stewart gets bored when things grow too pleasant. ""Stevie Bam Jackson"" trudges to a waterdrop metronome as soul radio samples and Victoria's Secret muzak flash by. Our man then shreds everything and denies responsibility. <i>Bidnezz</i>'s most arresting moment, ""Mltply"", skitters a Rhodes-funk riff over a sublime, blue-sky flute duet with upright bass. ""End of C"" is a minute-long trance of strings time-stretched into a leaking flood basin that wrecks the song's recording tape. You frighten me, Stewart.</p></div>"|5021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5021-bidnezz/|7.7|Cameron Macdonald

Their slow, rueful country-tinged indie rock sound hasn't changed much during their short-lived recording career-- but the world certainly has, and an increasingly popular tendency to curl into a foetal ball and wallow in self-pity makes their music seem more timely and palatable. <i>I Before E</i>, a piecemeal album consisting of three new Carissa's tracks and a live performance, is fittingly jumbled and confused, and frequently moving.</p><p>
    
    The new tracks are among the most intricate songs the band has composed. The dirge-paced ""Phantom Fireworks"" crawls out of the gate, stumbling along with a simple, repeating guitar figure supporting Brooke's breathy vocals. Gradually, stark slide guitar and viola accompaniment emerge from the track's shadows, building until the song's group chorus. ""Die"" is the album's strongest track, and one of the best songs Carissa's Wierd has recorded. The song's liveliness conceals its melancholic directness (""Die/ Die/ I want to die""), and its flexible shifting between earnest piano ballad and upbeat pop suggests a newfound complexity in composition.</p><p>
    
    The relatively straightforward ballad ""Blue Champagne Glass"" is more characteristic of the band's earlier material, and it acts as a nice transition into the live material. The remaining tracks document the band's final performances at Seattle's Crocodile Cafe, using songs from earlier albums (which are scheduled for wider re-release later this year). The performance is solid and well received, putting the band's characteristic despondency in a context that studio albums have never provided. There is discernible warmth in these tracks, and the appreciative audience helps underscore the tenderness so often overshadowed by their recorded material's relative starkness.</p><p>
    
    Though the live tracks are an excellent gift to the group's fans, it's a shame that the songs are much simpler than the new studio material. Carissa's Wierd's sound had room for maturation and experimentation, and there's something somewhat unsatisfying about the album's lack of cohesion-- even if a certain disjointedness should be expected given the project's limitations. Still, the muted orchestral swell of ""Drunk with the Only Saints I Know"", bittersweet string melody of ""Bathtile Green"", and subtle drive of closer ""Fluorescent Light"" are excellent reminders of the band's abililty to balance an outward dreariness with great melodies and inspired songwriting. <i>I Before E</i> is scattered but ultimately rewarding, largely depressing with the slightest hints of optimism shining through a bleak exterior-- and an appropriately poignant swan song.</p></div>"|1784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1784-i-before-e/|7.2|David Moore

Luckily, these two most recent volumes are as random a mess as the first four. Imagine if Andy Partridge had carefully curated these <i>Warbles</i> albums by theme, chronology, or quality instead of just digging them out from under his bed. As it is-- even though he saved us the work of snatching up cassettes, singles, and mp3s in order to collect all of this stuff-- die-hard XTC completists still have to slog through his scattered piles.</p><p>
    
    Volumes five and six are another mixed bag: About half of the tracks are demos of songs you've already heard on XTC records, but only a few are worth listening to in this form: The skiffle version of ""Dear God"" beats the portentous final version, ""Human Alchemy"" has more nervous energy and a better bass line, ""Earn Enough For Us"" actually works better in a rougher, struggling demo. Diehards will enjoy the behind-the-scenes listen to the making of ""Mermaid Smiling"", on which Partridge mocks up the arrangement at home and finds ways to beat the back of his guitar or inject white noise as he imagines the orchestrations to come. But the miracle of modern home recording allows Partridge to simulate <i>Nonsuch</i>'s ""Rook"" and ""Omnibus"" so completely that they mirror the final versions. And speaking of inessential, do we need these (unlistenable) demos from <i>Big Express</i>?</p><p>
    
    I buy these collections for their new material, like <i>Fuzzy Warbles 6</i>'s <i>Nonsuch</i> leftovers-- the dense lyrics of buttoned-up regret on ""End Of the Pier"" and the jumbled ""Prince of Orange"", on which the keyboard riff hits as unexpectedly as a broken seconds hand. ""I Can't Tell What Truth Is Anymore"" and ""The Tiny Circus of Life"" are solid XTC tracks, and the albums are also littered with perfect ideas in half-sturdy containers: images like ""the angel that fell for me,"" from <i>5</i>'s ""Defy You Gravity"" deserve a more permanent home.</p><p>
    
    The sixth volume, which begins and ends in laughter, has the smoothest sequencing and most consistent quality level of any <i>Warbles collection so far. But </i><i>5</i> contains more revealing material, including mid-80s leftovers from <i>Mummer</i>, <i>Big Express</i>, and <i>Skylarking</i>. Those albums followed Partridge as he ditched the glitz and anxiety of touring to come home, and wrote more reflective songs about England, the challenge of supporting a family, and the pitfalls of marriage. On XTC's most famous record, <i>Skylarking</i>, he and Colin Moulding even pulled these themes into a song cycle about nothing less than the circle of life and death.</p><p>
    
    But the castoffs are more intriguing. For all the songs Partridge has written about man's destruction of nature (see: <i>Apple Venus Vol. 1</i>), none spilled oil across more pastures than the clanking rhythms and WD-40 guitar on ""Motorcycle Landscapes"", with its seared riff and lyrics like, ""Glued up youths in high spirits throw kittens on the fire/ And down molester alley, the stabbed all roll in bliss."" By contrast, the lyrics of ""Broomstick Rhythm"" anticipate <i>Skylarking</i>'s ""Season Cycle"", and the sweet melody describes Partridge's fall into the bliss of domesticity.</p><p>
    
    Volume five actually starts with Partridge's finest rarity-- the Mummer reject ""Young Cleopatra"". It's an ecstatic portrait of a 14-year-old regent of the schoolyard, a kid who irresistably draws the boys to ""be [her] dogs."" The kids will do anything, the teachers can't look away, and Partridge shows the kind of love that lets parents pull one child out of the throng and call it special, when he sings, ""Your school uniform looks grey on others but silver on you.""</p><p>
    
    When I first found the song, in an even rougher demo where you can't make out the lyrics, I actually thought Partridge was singing about his own daughter. Instead, he tells us that ""I'm glad your father is my friend/ And now that school is at an end/ He's only an excuse for me to wait here at your palace gates."" In that sense, this is a Lolita song. But it's also the purest Lolita song ever recorded. In spite of the reference to The Police's ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"", Partridge sings about the girl without lust: He's observing her from afar, celebrating her sexuality without molesting it, and what you hear in his voice is pride. And though I was wrong about his being the dad, the mistake makes more sense if you listen to the song that best complements this one-- <i>Wasp Star</i>'s ""Playground"", on which his real daughter sings regal back-up vocals.</p><p>
    
    If you spend enough time with Partridge's demos, you realize he's thrown away better songs than most people have written. He only doles out a few of them on each <i>Warbles</i> discs, but six discs in, it's still enough for fans to remain interested, try to figure out why he left them out, analyze what they can tell us about Partridge, and-- more than anything-- to play with them ourselves, at home, projecting our own song cycles onto these scraps.</p></div>"|11801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11801-fuzzy-warbles-5fuzzy-warbles-6/|6.6|Chris Dahlen

Luckily, these two most recent volumes are as random a mess as the first four. Imagine if Andy Partridge had carefully curated these <i>Warbles</i> albums by theme, chronology, or quality instead of just digging them out from under his bed. As it is-- even though he saved us the work of snatching up cassettes, singles, and mp3s in order to collect all of this stuff-- die-hard XTC completists still have to slog through his scattered piles.</p><p>
    
    Volumes five and six are another mixed bag: About half of the tracks are demos of songs you've already heard on XTC records, but only a few are worth listening to in this form: The skiffle version of ""Dear God"" beats the portentous final version, ""Human Alchemy"" has more nervous energy and a better bass line, ""Earn Enough For Us"" actually works better in a rougher, struggling demo. Diehards will enjoy the behind-the-scenes listen to the making of ""Mermaid Smiling"", on which Partridge mocks up the arrangement at home and finds ways to beat the back of his guitar or inject white noise as he imagines the orchestrations to come. But the miracle of modern home recording allows Partridge to simulate <i>Nonsuch</i>'s ""Rook"" and ""Omnibus"" so completely that they mirror the final versions. And speaking of inessential, do we need these (unlistenable) demos from <i>Big Express</i>?</p><p>
    
    I buy these collections for their new material, like <i>Fuzzy Warbles 6</i>'s <i>Nonsuch</i> leftovers-- the dense lyrics of buttoned-up regret on ""End Of the Pier"" and the jumbled ""Prince of Orange"", on which the keyboard riff hits as unexpectedly as a broken seconds hand. ""I Can't Tell What Truth Is Anymore"" and ""The Tiny Circus of Life"" are solid XTC tracks, and the albums are also littered with perfect ideas in half-sturdy containers: images like ""the angel that fell for me,"" from <i>5</i>'s ""Defy You Gravity"" deserve a more permanent home.</p><p>
    
    The sixth volume, which begins and ends in laughter, has the smoothest sequencing and most consistent quality level of any <i>Warbles collection so far. But </i><i>5</i> contains more revealing material, including mid-80s leftovers from <i>Mummer</i>, <i>Big Express</i>, and <i>Skylarking</i>. Those albums followed Partridge as he ditched the glitz and anxiety of touring to come home, and wrote more reflective songs about England, the challenge of supporting a family, and the pitfalls of marriage. On XTC's most famous record, <i>Skylarking</i>, he and Colin Moulding even pulled these themes into a song cycle about nothing less than the circle of life and death.</p><p>
    
    But the castoffs are more intriguing. For all the songs Partridge has written about man's destruction of nature (see: <i>Apple Venus Vol. 1</i>), none spilled oil across more pastures than the clanking rhythms and WD-40 guitar on ""Motorcycle Landscapes"", with its seared riff and lyrics like, ""Glued up youths in high spirits throw kittens on the fire/ And down molester alley, the stabbed all roll in bliss."" By contrast, the lyrics of ""Broomstick Rhythm"" anticipate <i>Skylarking</i>'s ""Season Cycle"", and the sweet melody describes Partridge's fall into the bliss of domesticity.</p><p>
    
    Volume five actually starts with Partridge's finest rarity-- the Mummer reject ""Young Cleopatra"". It's an ecstatic portrait of a 14-year-old regent of the schoolyard, a kid who irresistably draws the boys to ""be [her] dogs."" The kids will do anything, the teachers can't look away, and Partridge shows the kind of love that lets parents pull one child out of the throng and call it special, when he sings, ""Your school uniform looks grey on others but silver on you.""</p><p>
    
    When I first found the song, in an even rougher demo where you can't make out the lyrics, I actually thought Partridge was singing about his own daughter. Instead, he tells us that ""I'm glad your father is my friend/ And now that school is at an end/ He's only an excuse for me to wait here at your palace gates."" In that sense, this is a Lolita song. But it's also the purest Lolita song ever recorded. In spite of the reference to The Police's ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"", Partridge sings about the girl without lust: He's observing her from afar, celebrating her sexuality without molesting it, and what you hear in his voice is pride. And though I was wrong about his being the dad, the mistake makes more sense if you listen to the song that best complements this one-- <i>Wasp Star</i>'s ""Playground"", on which his real daughter sings regal back-up vocals.</p><p>
    
    If you spend enough time with Partridge's demos, you realize he's thrown away better songs than most people have written. He only doles out a few of them on each <i>Warbles</i> discs, but six discs in, it's still enough for fans to remain interested, try to figure out why he left them out, analyze what they can tell us about Partridge, and-- more than anything-- to play with them ourselves, at home, projecting our own song cycles onto these scraps.</p></div>"|11801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11801-fuzzy-warbles-5fuzzy-warbles-6/|6.4|Chris Dahlen

Prince Paul can boast the groundbreaking horrorcore of Gravediggaz and his rap-opera <i>A Prince Among Thieves</i>; Nakamura helped with both the sci-fi epic Deltron 3030 and animated pop band Gorillaz.</p><p>
    
    On their 1999 debut Handsome Boy Modeling School collaboration <i>So... How's Your Girl</i>, the two introduced themselves in slippery alter-egos, as cunning lotharios Chest Rockwell (Prince Paul) and Nathaniel Merriweather (Nakamura), two spokesmen for a $60 finishing school for jetsetters.  Between them, their understanding of hip-hop concept records is virtually unmatched-- their projects have displayed ambitious, genre-mashing blends of novelty, unity, and style.  And from dozens of in-character interviews (""Handsome people attract other handsome people,"" Merriweather once quipped), to the regal coiffure and handlebar mustaches in their press photos, Paul and Dan consistently projected the HBMS motif in their public appearances.</p><p>
    
    But an amusing concept alone isn't sufficient enough to carry an album, and <i>White People</i>, the overstuffed, underdeveloped, meandering 53-minute musical odyssey that returns them to the spotlight after a half-decade of silence, fails to reflect the audacity of their off-stage personas.  Aside from Father Guido Sarducci's sardonic monologues and skits featuring Tim Meadows, the moniker Handsome Boy Modeling School serves its purpose in title only.  It follows no particular direction, jumping from Del's sucka emcee baiting on ""The World's Gone Mad"" to Cat Power's lugubrious pleading on ""I've Been Thinking"" to RZA's punitive beatings on ""A Day in the Life"".  How these fit under <i>White People</i>'s thematic umbrella is a mystery.</p><p>
<i>White People</i> is adorned with a few quality tracks. Longtime Prince Paul compatriots De La Soul worship at the altar of fame on ""If It Wasn't For You"", setting their rhymes against a triumphant bobbing brassline and echoing woodwinds, while ""First... and Then"" resurrects an energetic Dres (Black Sheep), who crafts a workout routine for a night out.  But these noteworthy cuts do not veil Handsome Boy's central problem: The duo seem to fit the album to its guests rather than vice versa.</p><p>
    
    At the heart of this debacle lies the seven-minute colossus ""Rock and Roll (Hip-Hop Could Never Hip-Hop Like This), Pt. 2"". Bringing together such disparate characters as Lord Finesse, Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, DJ Q-Bert, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Jazzy Jay, the cut sounds more like a rework of the LP's previous material than an actual collaboration between these guests.  It's like Carmen Santiago kidnapped Pharrell Williams and Jack Johnson and forced them to record an album with Rockapell at the boards.  Combine pianist heartthrob Jamie Cullum and John Oates?  Genius!  Mike Patton and Jack Johnson got a free minute? Brilliant!  Is Rahzel even on the album?  <i>Who cares?!</i></p><p>
    
    As a result, <i>White People</i>, for all its ambitions, fails to coalesce.  Worse, it falls victim to the flipside of MF Doom's critique: Handsome Boy Modeling School is all about the image, not about the music.  ""That's the point!"" supporters might retort.  ""HBSM is parodying the state of commercial hip-hop.  The scene!""  Okay, but that's just starting a shitty band as a commentary on shitty bands and expecting people to respect you for it.  Given Paul and Nakamura's successful outings, they possess the capability to deliver a concept album brimming with energy and solidarity.  <i>White People</i>, unfortunately, bursts with inconsistency.</p></div>"|3725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3725-white-people/|6.6|Jamin Warren

And as the new career-spanning compilation <i>This Is Music: The Singles 92-98</i> reveals, the history of his band, The Verve, is a good story as well. They began by playing sprawling, kaleidoscopic, heavens-scraping jams. These 60s-style improvisatory mindfucks were then edited down into the slightly less sprawling tracks that comprise the group's 1993 debut, <em>A Storm in Heaven</em>, an intoxicating amalgam of psychedelica and shoegaze.</p><p>
    
    Then Verve became The Verve (jazz 1, rock 0) and started to discipline their diaphanous noisescapes with traditional British songcraft. They released an ecstasy-laden promise of even better things to come, 1995's <em>A Northern Soul</em>. Ashcroft earned praise in song from the biggest band in Britain, Oasis. And then the band broke up.</p><p>
    
    But Ashcroft, the story's iconic hero as well as its raconteur, had prophesied that his band would secure a place in the rock'n'roll firmament. And lo, it was so: The band reformed, and 1997's decade-defining <em>Urban Hymns</em> almost made up for the then-recent demise of Britpop.</p><p>
    
    Sure, Ashcroft went on to release solo albums littered with self-indulgent drivel, and masterful guitarist Nick McCabe has been uncharacteristically quiet. Meanwhile, bassist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury's royalty checks sure aren't writing themselves! (Late addition Simon Tong? He found a gig as Blur's new Graham Coxon.) That just means it's time for the next phase of the story: The singles compilation, complete with ""new"" tracks. If The Verve's tale is Ashcroft's epic, <em>This Is Music</em> is his short-stories anthology.</p><p>
    
    Here's where the narrative starts to fall apart. The disc doesn't follow any recognizable order. So if newcomers want a quick taste of the early Verve's vast, submarine jamming, they'll have to skip to tracks five and eleven, respectively, to hear rare-ish singles ""She's a Superstar"" and ""Gravity Grave."" The conch-shaped guitar lines of first single ""All in the Mind"" announce the group's arrival to the world on track nine. The Ride-like shimmer of ""Slide Away"" (track two) and the droning anthemics of ""Blue"" (track seven) represent the debut full-length admirably, though a little context would be nice.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, the sophomore album's ""This Is Music"" makes a stirring opener for any compilation, perfectly melding McCabe's searing guitar lines with Ashcroft's spacey vocals. ""If love is a drug then I don't need it,"" Ashcroft declares. The second single from the second record, ""On Your Own,"" introduced audiences to the acoustic balladry-- with handclaps!-- that would reach full bloom on <em>Urban Hymns</em>. It also proved that Ashcroft suffers from the same lyrical banality that often marked Noel Gallagher's compositions. ""Gotta get rid of this hole inside,"" Ashcroft chants, and it sounds like a revelation rather than a tired cliche. Two tracks earlier, ""History"" is another <em>A Northern Soul</em> ballad, with strings from John Lennon's ""Mind Games"" and enough rarefied sadness for a Ford Madox Ford novel.</p><p>
<em>This Is Music</em> boasts four songs from The Verve's masterpiece, <em>Urban Hymns</em>, and all are as revelatory now as they must have been when they capped off Ashcroft's Brit-rock bildungsroman. ""Sonnet"" verges on sappy, but some of Ashcroft's Bono-tastic bombast makes the song soar. ""Lucky Man"" applies the same formula to existential angst and what Whitney Houston called ""The Greatest Love of All."" Both ballads are good, but neither can compare to ""The Drugs Don't Work,"" a marvel of subtlety amid world-weary lyrics-- ""All this talk of getting old is bringing me down""-- and understated strings. This was a hit because it's fucking great. It's that simple.</p><p>
    
    ""Bittersweet Symphony"" marches brazenly through a day in the life, staring head-on at the immutability of the human spirit and our paradoxically mercurial nature (""I'm a million different people""); both realities are true, the song suggests. In America, it's The Verve's only well-known song, but it's one hell of a legacy.</p><p>
    
    Of course, The Verve also are to blame for the uneven British wuss-rock of Travis (once likened to ""cheese on toast"" by Damon Albarn), Keane, and The Veils. They've even influenced American bathos-mongers like Howie Day, who's been known to cover ""The Drugs Don't Work"" in his tantrum-filled live shows. Alas, the two bonus tracks at the end of the compilations don't bolster The Verve's defense. <em>Urban Hymns</em>-era unreleased track ""This Could Be My Moment"" is elegant, uplifting, and as catchy as a TV jingle, but it lacks the world-conquering vision of the songs that actually made that album. ""Monte Carlo"" features a pleasant bass groove, but as soon as I finish this sentence I'll have forgotten how it goes.</p><p>
    
    In sum, <em>This Is Music: The Singles 92-98</em> features 12 classics and two superfluous tunes from the vault. If you already own the albums, you won't have much use for this compilation. New fans ought to start with <em>Urban Hymns</em> and work their way back, and the arbitrary track order here serves no one. But the songs' quality remains undeniable, and a greatest-hits disc is better than no Verve at all-- at least until Ashcroft writes the final chapter with a ""Behind the Music""-inspired reunion tour.</p></div>"|8455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8455-this-is-music-the-singles-92-98/|8.3|Marc Hogan

He later jettisoned that group's Velvet Underground-tinged drone for an acoustic guitar and gigs on ""Sesame Street"" and in <em>There's Something About Mary</em>. Now the 53-year-old patron saint of the eternally childlike is back with <em>Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love</em>, another set of doe-eyed, goofily innocent songs of love and growing up by a boy genius who never will.</p><p>
    
    With Richman's gentle guitar and Tommy Larkins' birthday-party percussion, this record sounds much like his last outing, 2001's <em>Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow</em>, except this time Richman handles the clean, chaste production himself. But while that album described relationships in all their messy vitality, <em>Not So Much</em> is really a record about art. It obviates criticism-- ""He gave us the wine to taste, not to talk about it,"" Richman sings-- but could inspire ponderous tomes of scholarly exegesis and coloring book after coloring book of outside-the-lines Crayola scribblings.</p><p>
    
    An artist must adhere to his own, singular vision above all else, Richman proposes, and to do so apparently requires all the imagination and unbridled glee of an eight-year-old. Here the man who wrote the immortal ""Pablo Picasso"" breezily revives ""Vincent Van Gogh"", a classic from his long-out-of-print 1986 LP <em>Rockin' and Romance</em>. ""He loved color and he let it show,"" the singer explains. On ""Salvador Dali"", a characteristically earnest narrator describes how Dali's art got him through adolescence and introduced him ""to the dream world, to the dream world."" The album's title, from a prayer by St. Francis of Assisi, is far more than a homily about romantic or platonic love. What's important for Richman and his favorite painters is not popular affection, but their art-- which is an expression of love itself. See?</p><p>
<em>Not So Much</em> is suffused with this creative love. It's the kind of love that necessitates repetition. Van Morrison once called it ""the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves to love the love that loves to love the love that loves,"" layering a few simple Germanic syllables with endless mists of meaning. In a perky, 50s-style love song, Richman calls it ""My Baby Love Love Loves Me"".</p><p>
    
    This kind of love causes Richman to speak in tongues: Italian on the exuberant ""In Che Mondo Viviamo"" and the boisterous bossa nova of ""Cosi Veloce"", French for ""On a Du Soleil"" (a track that's like <em>un chat</em> yawning by a window in the afternoon) and the similarly celestial ""Les Etoiles"". I'm unable to understand either language without Babelfish, but I can still marvel at these sounds. True love ""brings up hurt from when you were five years old,"" Richman once sang. But it also brings up joy.</p></div>"|6782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6782-not-so-much-to-be-loved-as-to-love/|8.1|Marc Hogan

In the mid-90s, these guys were the toast of the post-rock scene-- even though more often than not they actually did rock. <i>Futureworld</i> and <i>The Surveillance</i> were concentrated, nasty albums that sang straight to your machine soul. By the 00s, though, Trans Am LPs became sprawling refuges for labored irony. If anyone can actually remember a thing about the second half of <i>Red Line</i>, I'd be surprised, and Trans Am have only gone downhill from there. Therefore, it only makes sense that the band's members might be itching to try something new, and drummer Sebastian Thomson is the first to head out on his own-- although exactly how new his work as The Frequency actually is to him is open for debate.</p><p>
    
    For one thing, outside of Thomson's omnipresent (and often unremarkable) vocals there's not a whole lot of difference between the dark, buzzing vibe of this album and the late work of Trans Am. There is an absolute ton of sawtoothed synth on this record, and it's heaped on top of an absolute ton of Kraftwerk-styled synth patterns and lockstep beats-- both live and programmed. Thomson's singing give the album more of a focal point than most recent Trans Am fare, but he's frequently found well inside the mix, and often there's little melodic contour for his competent everyman voice to follow. Often, his unaffected voice simply doesn't sound at home in this songs-- I never thought I'd ever have to say ""needs more vocoder,"" but here we are.</p><p>
    
    Bur this album does have plenty going for it. Thomson is a killer drummer but he's not showy, and at the heart of every song lies a solid rhythmic foundation. What Thomson does best is evil synth pop, and the songs that follow that road are usually pretty great, from opener ""You're the Perfect Size"" to the <i>Computer World</i> strut of ""One Chance"" and ""Zapatos Blancos"". ""Erasing Myself"" is less synth-oriented, but it carries the same feel and has some of the album's best vocals-- double tracking does wonders to liven up Thomson's delivery. ""Own Me"" adds almost jangly guitars to an itchy synth groove. It's the album's brightest moment, and one of its best tracks. If the LP were focused solely on this type of material, Thomson would have a pretty handsome record; as it is, he succumbs to his band's tendency to pile on subpar material, and he really loses his footing on the album's more rock-oriented numbers-- check the overripe guitar leads on ""Moonburn"" or the boring, sludgy slog of ""Forgot"", with its weakly shouted vocals and non-melody.</p><p>
    
    So, unfortunately, The Frequency doesn't seem to be a step toward regaining Trans Am's sense of pinpoint focus-- even if it is both stronger than that band's recent releases and contains its share of highlights. There are certainly worse traits for a musician to have than not knowing when to stop, but in this case it's the difference between a good album and a merely fair one.</p></div>"|3329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3329-the-frequency/|6.9|Joe Tangari

Not frustration at The Man or over crusty, narrow-minded punks accusing The Clash of selling out, but frustration over the audience response.  Simonon was upset that a crowd at New York City's Palladium was made to remain seated, effectively eliminating the crowd/band synergy The Clash had worked so hard to perfect. Opening bands know this feeling well, and it must be incredibly difficult to play a great show if the audience is having no visible reaction to your music.</p><p>
    
    Watching the DVD portion of Wire's <i>Wire on the Box</i>, I was struck by the band's energy and passion in the face of a very nearly inert crowd. In an hour-long set filmed for (then-West) Germany's ""Rockpalast"" television program, the band are tight, focused, even demented in their intensity at times, but partly because of the rules in the television studio: the tiny audience scarcely budges, and only claps politely between numbers.  The audience is only four rows deep, and they're sitting on benches.  Some audience members even look confused when the camera pans their faces between songs, as if they weren't sure what to expect from a Wire show.  Then again, perhaps you can't hold that against them; Wire were a notoriously unpredictable live act in their heyday, and nine of the songs they played in this set hadn't yet been released at the time.</p><p>
    
    Those songs that were new in February 1979 eventually became the bulk of Wire's third album, <i>154</i>.  But even as the band demoed them for live European audiences that spring (opening for Roxy Music, no less), they sounded fully formed, differing only from their studio versions in density and texture.  That Wire were already hitting audiences with new material hot on the heels of their 1978 sophomore opus <i>Chairs Missing</i> is indicative of the kind of band they were and always have been, i.e. never dwelling on the past and constantly evolving.  That unrelenting flux is also what makes <i>Wire on the Box</i> an odd release in the band's catalog.  It's the second live recording to be released from Wire's original phase, but the first one, 1981's <i>Document &amp; Eyewitness</i> felt like another step forward for the band (if at times an utterly confounding one), whereas this one is uncharacteristically retrospect, a sort of ""Greatest Hits Live"" album.</p><p>
    
    That said, if Wire felt the need to throw fans a traditional archival bone, they certainly could have done a lot worse.  The performance here is spot-on and the sound is spectacularly clear, though I'd argue that the vocals are mixed a tad too high, which distances them somewhat from the guitars.  And the packaging conceit is a brilliant one that should be employed more often: the hour-long show is available to watch on DVD (along with a mumbly but informative 20-minute interview with the band), but also appears in its entirety on a separate CD so that it can be listened to as an album, without the video feed.  That makes it a more versatile release, allowing you to enjoy the music on its own terms or to take in the spectacle of late-70s German television with the goofy prog-rock ""Rockpalast"" logo and seemingly arbitrary camerawork that quickly cuts from shots of all four band members to close-ups of Colin Newman's facial pores.</p><p>
    
    Newman is in brilliant voice for the set, shouting, yelping, and singing with ecstatic abandon.  He and bassist Graham Lewis occasionally acknowledge their meager audience or give the title of a new song, but otherwise, the lackluster assortment in front of them might as well be in another time zone-- you'd think they were playing Wembley the way they confidently range across material from their early output, dishing out a killer take on the <i>Pink Flag</i> title track and a stunning, breathtaking version of <i>Chairs Missing</i>'s ""Heartbeat"". They're clearly most content with the new material, though, ripping through <i>154</i> gems like ""The 15th"" and ""Two People in a Room"", as well as giving the full apocalyptic treatment to the epic noise wall ""A Touching Display"", on which Bruce Gilbert's processed bass sears a quasi-melody that I'd previously imagined to have come from a guitar.</p><p>
    
    More than anything else, this set highlights how singular and amazing Wire were at their peak.  They could be flattening and catchy at once, and they were a visual oddity, with skinny-tied Newman and Lewis swirling wildly between drummer Robert Gotobed, who looks almost robotic, and Gilbert, who I swear never looks away from his guitar for all 58 minutes.  And what makes the quality and ferocity of the show all the more impressive is the circumstances: How they mustered this much energy and focus for such a wallflower crowd I'll never know, but the end result is an excellent document of an essential band at the height of their powers.</p></div>"|8714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8714-wire-on-the-box-1979/|8.1|Joe Tangari

He's not the same kid who turned up out of nowhere on ""Deep Cover"". He no longer possesses that menacing lean, that cool, dangerous charisma, that effortless way of just rapping through the beat like he was always a part of it and it was always a part of him.  These days, he's that haggard-looking, vaguely creepy middle-ager who was in <i>Starsky &amp; Hutch</i>, the ""P.I.M.P."" video, and some pornos.  He's always hanging out with that pimp bishop guy.  He says ""wizzle wizzle"" a lot.  He comes out with an album every couple of years, and no one pays any attention because Dr. Dre doesn't have anything to do with it.</p><p>
    
    Finally, with <i>R&amp;G;: The Masterpiece</i>, Snoop seems to have realized he's not getting younger.  Unfortunately, he's tackled this dilemma by recording lots of terrible seductive soul tracks.  <i>R&amp;G; (Rhythm &amp; Gangsta): The Masterpiece</i> is absolutely crammed with them-- a nearly endless amount (18 songs, 78 minutes).  ""I want to get you alone so I can learn you a little better,"" he purrs on ""Stay"".  ""Everything is beautiful/ Right down to ya cuticles,"" he coos on ""Perfect"".  ""Flip the channel to Lifetime/ You stay on my mind even when I write rhymes,"" he growls on ""Promise I"".  But somehow, it's hard to take Snoop's appreciation of the opposite sex seriously when the second track on the album, ""Can You Control Ya Hoe"", advocates violence against women more brutally than anything
    he's done since ""Bitches Ain't Shit"".  But girl, you can watch Lifetime!</p><p>
<i>R&amp;G;</i> is Snoop's first album for Star Trak, the label run by fallen-off hip-hop hitmakers the Neptunes, a duo who all but ruled international radio with dazzling sci-fi stomp-clap new wave beats, but who've been starving for hits ever since they switched up their style to overcooked Vegas schmaltz-- all bloopy bass and shuffling drums and swooshing keyboards and unbelievably obnoxious falsetto crooning.  The production duo laced five of this album's songs, but their fingerprints are everywhere else here. <i>R&amp;G;</i> has a unified sound, rare in hip-hop albums, but it's a sound based on tinkly pianos and noodly guitars and windchimes. It sounds something like The Black Eyed Peas if they tried to make a Barry White album, but with more falsetto warbling.</p><p>
    
    Snoop's voice is still a cool, gravelly drawl, but he doesn't insinuate himself into the beat the way he once did.  He pretty much just talks over the beats, seemingly barely aware of their presence.  On their respective guest spots, Nelly and Daz easily outshine him.  Snoop only comes to life on a handful of rough, club-friendly tracks, most notably ""Step Yo Game Up"", a Lil' Jon production that sounds just like circa-2000 Neptunes. It's one of the few moments on the album in which he sounds like a real adult, and not just a sad old man, washed up and worn down.</p></div>"|7788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7788-rg-rhythm-gangsta-the-masterpiece/|2.1|Tom Breihan

It could be a perfect confluence of notes and timbres or a brilliantly conveyed sentiment, but it could also really be anything. It's not one of those things you can put into effective words-- you just know it when you hear it. And to me, The Ex make vital music.</p><p>
    
    For 25 years, the Dutch band have nipped at the fringe of post-punk, steering stridently clear of corporate-owned record labels and lighting up the left side of the political spectrum with more than a dozen albums proudly splattered with anarcho-syndicalist and anti-consumerist sentiment. But they're not just shouting about trade unionism, materialist greed, and the inherent contradictions of modern free-market societies; they can bring the noise, too, and their polemics come wrapped in a blistering package of smoldering art-punk informed by free jazz and global folk. On their latest album, <i>Turn</i>, they elevate their craft to near perfection over the course of two wild, unpredictable, and unforgettable discs.</p><p>
    
    The bulk of the songs that comprise <i>Turn</i> hew to The Ex's peculiar brand of crushing, dense post-punk, but the music can veer on a dime into spoken satire, Eritrean freedom songs, and savage improvisation. Steve Albini returns to the boards for them on this album, and nobody captures The Ex better than he does-- the sound is dry and caustic, allergic to reverb, as heavy as Shellac, and relentlessly intense. The band's setup is extremely basic-- guitar, standup bass, and drums-- but they wring a lot out of it, particularly the bass. The instrument is amplified and then scraped, beaten, sawed, and distorted, alternately used to create an annihilating low-end and to emulate electronic effects or panicked voices. The drums are mixed high for maximum damage and principle vocalist GW Sok-- who doesn't sing so much as rant-- winds up somewhere near the middle of it all, a voice caught in a hellstorm of overdriven guitar, unable to control his surroundings but forced to comment on them through a sense of duty.</p><p>
    
    Sok runs himself breathless on the brilliant opener ""Listen to the Painters"", clipping syllables in the mantra ""We need poets, we need painters/ We need poets, we need painters/ We need poetry and paintings,"" and his sense of English wordplay is better than that of a lot of native speakers: ""Sheep with crazy leaders/ Heading for disaster/ Courting jesters who take themselves for masters/ The shrub who took himself for a park/ The squeak who took himself for a bark."" The churning guitars and daisy cutter bass tears a hole in the crust of the earth from which Sok's frenetic second verse can pour. He takes his wordplay to incredible satirical heights on ""The Pie"", which opens with a genuinely demented reading of a recipe for sweet potato pie that, as it turns out, is being baked for the purpose of smashing it in the face of authority. Sok piles puns on top of vitriol with the lines ""In a world full of poor and an environment to protect/ An alternative flan of action flies in the face of promises not kept/ It shows that the responsible irresponsibles have faces and names which can be addressed/ Therefore bake and aim and put a smile back on the faces of the oppressed"" as the band rages beneath him; there is darkness at the heart of this humor.</p><p>
    
    The band uses the two-disc format to offer the listener a break-- 90 straight minutes of caustic, melody-averse art punk is a lot to take in-- and they intentionally place the album's most violent, punishing, exhilarating track, ""Theme from Konono"", at the beginning of disc two, right next to ""Huriye"", which is both a cover of an Eritrean protest song from their fight for independence from Ethiopia and the most beautifully melodic song on the record. ""Theme from Konono"" is basically a summary of everything the Ex do best, building over the course of several minutes from scratchy guitar interplay into a full-on juggernaut of barreling rhythm. The song piles tension upon tension, building and tightening until it's almost unbearable, finally blowing open with a pounding beat and lockstep guitar riffs and then slowly re-upping the ante. Based on an assault like this, you'd never guess any of these people are over 40.</p><p>
    
    About the only bands from punk's original era that are still as bracing and original as The Ex are Wire and The Fall. What's truly amazing about <i>Turn</i> is how colossal, how ingenious, how <i>vital it sounds. Just about any of the current post-punk crop sound downright milquetoast when put up against The Ex's vibrant assault and well-considered commentary. On ""Listen to the Painters"", The Ex remind us of the need for poets and painters and builders and dancers and writers-- by the end of the album, it's clear we need The Ex, too.</i></p></div>"|2861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2861-turn/|8.8|Joe Tangari

Just ask my youngest sib, who has to endure the nightmare of living in the shadow of the inventor of the non-fiction novel and author of <i>The Presidential Papers</i>. My name is Norman Mailer. (I also invented the goblin that returns your emails.) But Oh No, who coincidentally shares his real name with the other famous little bro/convict-to-be Michael Jackson, manages to rise above his elder sib Madlib's legacy and chalk one up for the bottom end of the birth order. Oh No acts as a veritable sponge, selectively absorbing the respective musical atmospheres of his contemporaries and squeezing out ample goodness.</p><p>
    
    True, you get the sense that novelty is hardly Oh No's strength. At times, <i>The Disrupt</i> feels like Oh No's private Halloween party with each cut in fully bloomed apparel. ""Stomp That"" draws straight from the Jaylib playbook, ripe with gorilla pimp jungle thumps and the vocal intensity of a yet-to-be-quashed beef at Detroit BBQ. Likewise, ""Perceptions"" dishes a lovable, but easily imitable 70s Soul hustle as he recites standard criminal banter: ""You got dollars/ Then come make cents with me."" But Oh No deftly xeroxes and then wisely imbellishes; each recreation tantalizes with the greatness of its association while still forging a notably eclectic niche.</p><p>
    
    Oh No's nimbleness on the mic is easily matched by his creativity in the booth. <i>The Disrupt</i> brims with an understated vibrance rarely found in a debut release. ""Seventeen"" swims in an ephemeral gloom as Oh No lends the obligatory Afterschool Special ode to the teen caught in the game. The album's opening volley, ""I'm Here"", presents Oh No's unabridged bio in less than three minutes, and does so against a sprinkle of keys and stuttering vibes. ""Life in the Ox is like life out of the Ox,"" Oh No quips about his hometown, dispelling any belief that-- despite the number of musicians it has produced-- that it's anything special.</p><p>
    
    Yet thematically, <i>The Disrupt</i> unfortunately lives up to its name-- Oh No seems to have pitched a collection of singles rather than a cohesive album. While each individual track demonstrates his strengths, the tempo and tone of the album explodes and subsides wildly and fails to build an interpretive framework. The pixilated, frenetic crescendos of ""The Ride"" barrels headlong into Aloe Blacc's sultry vocals and escapist mantra on ""The Getaway"". Perhaps the often jarring transitions are purposeful, but the gaps are still distracting and prevent the album from delivering closure.</p><p>
    
    Nonetheless, the son of soulman Otis Jackson and nephew of trumpetist Jon Faddis proudly revists his fam's talented crest. And what's more, <i>The Disrupt</i> adds another gold star to Stones Throw's heavily adorned jacket.</p></div>"|6100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6100-the-disrupt/|7.8|Jamin Warren

Consider how Kimi Recor chain-smokes her third clove and leers at a Juliet Capulet who watches a subway station's fluorescent ceiling as if bathed in divine light. ""People are such strange creatures,"" Recor purrs from the gut. ""So cold and lonely."" An acoustic bass struggles to pass through the turnstile; the ticket machines' steady clicks and bleeps serve as incidental beats. Recor then mimics Juliet's whines-- ""I was dying before I was ever born!"" Her train arrives, 10 minutes late. ""Fuck those grieving motherfuckers!"" She exhales. ""Fuck 'em all!""</p><p>
    
    That was ""Strange Creatures"", the opener for John Tejada's latest micro-glitch techno excursion, <i>Logic Memory Center</i>. While Recor's spat is the most subversive moment here, the L.A.-based producer still makes failures sound so gosh-darn funky. It's fitting that his 10th album is named after the crimson-lit room where HAL 9000 sang ""Daisy"" in <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. His melodies are best described as ""absentee melodies"" in trimming off notes to the bone. True to his beloved Detroit techno's tradition, Tejada keeps a steady drum machine thump to not distract from the groove-- letting the melodic detritus swing on the dancefloor. Comparisons to tech-house media-darling Matthew Dear are inevitable, but Tejada's sound has more fresh ideas. Although Tejada's arrangements can be too busy at times, and they often grow an acre of corn with UV-lights and hydrophonic vats.</p><p>
<i>Logic</i>'s best moments are its klutziest. ""Possessive Patterns"" marches to work at 5 a.m. to a rhythm that is still fixing its socks. The Future is seen through bleary eyes as this song's muttering organs and melodies that seemed looped from commercials polluting the downtown air, all attest. ""This Fake Place"" first sounds like it's printing itself out, given its grinding noises and acid-techno synths that try to maintain a water-cooler conversation. ""Strive"" has an Akufen-style microhouse chop that gets perverted by Looney Tunes-fashioned rubber-band wonks. ""Loose Change"", uncannily produces a tap-dancing cadence that swings between guitar fragments and microtonal blips.</p><p>
    
    Tejada's absentee-melodies don't always pay the bills and he should've done some quality control with his guest singers, James Figurine and Carl A. Finlow. The album closer, ""Something about the Drums"", putts along with a half-arsed, acid-synth squelch that doesn't complement a bush league house thump. Figurine delivers a cliche motivational speech on the otherwise engrossing, jazz-snap of ""Everything Will Be OK."" And then there's Finlow on ""Alone with You"", a Depeche Mode karaoke number. He drops zingers like ""Shadows forming over walls/ Catch the moonlight as it falls,"" and ""Tasting a teardrop from her cheek/ Gives me strength when I am weak."" Draw your own conclusions.</p></div>"|7961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7961-logic-memory-center/|7.7|Cameron Macdonald

Next week, the Nirvana box set is finally released, as is a new two-disc expanded version of Nine Inch Nails' <i>The Downward Spiral</i>; Low's upcoming Sub Pop record kicks off with a track whose rhythm section and vocal melody sound like a miniature version of Alice in Chains; <i>Q</i> magazine named The Red Hot Chili Peppers the Best Act in the World Today at its 2004 awards show; TV commercials for Green Day's <i>American Idiot</i> reminds us that 10 years ago they released <i>Dookie</i>; and now Pearl Jam are lionized with the two-disc, 33-track, best-of album, <i>Rearviewmirror</i>. I'd be frightened that we're about to undergo a full-blown 90s alternarock revival-- an era depressingly and backhandedly praised as much for what it was not (e.g. the hair metal that it ""kicked out,"" or the nu-metal that some of it slowly morphed into) than the music it produced.  But then, it never went away, did it?</p><p>
    
    In recent years, Billy Corgan's Zwan, a reunited Jane's Addiction, the Scott Weiland-fronted Velvet Revolver, and the Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine mashup Audioslave have released records to varying degrees of commercial success.  Prior to that, the nascent sounds of grunge remained among the dominant North American hard rock templates throughout the 90s and into this decade, living on in a lineage that extended from its Seattle roots through Bush and Candlebox to Creed and Nickleback.</p><p>
    
    Oddly, Pearl Jam have remained a constant since the days when <i>120 Minutes</i> graduated to <i>Alternative Nation</i>, transitioning from stadium fillers to one of American rock's largest and most beloved cult bands, a Grateful Dead for the great washed.  After deftly turning their backs on fame just as much of the public seemed poised to turn on them, Pearl Jam cultivated the unwavering support of a cabal of devotees who followed the band across a string of studio albums that casual observers have likely forgotten-- <i>No Code</i>, <i>Yield</i>, <i>Binaural</i>, and <i>Riot Act</i>-- and the almost comical release of every live show from their 2000 tour, a move that, depending on your level of cynicism, was either a thank you or an unintentional fuck you to their lemmingesque fanbase.  Musically, Pearl Jam slightly spiced up their sound over the course of a decade, adding a few Eastern-tinged delicacies and some garage-rock snackfood to their typical meat-and-potatoes diet.  By the time Creed became a permanent fixture on late-90s rock radio, the Florida band sounded as much like Pearl Jam as, well, Pearl Jam themselves.</p><p>
<i>Rearviewmirror</i> divides the band's career into an ""up side"" and a ""down side""-- the former are the earnest rockers, the latter are the earnest ballads-- although the monikers would also have been appropriate had they arranged the record chronologically.  The ""down side"" to Pearl Jam's career allowed many people to romanticize the group's shift away from the spotlight as one purely of choice, and the band has since been characterized by honesty, good intentions, and yeoman's work, the sort of qualities that often make for turgid, sometimes rote, faceless music.</p><p>
    
    In truth, Pearl Jam were always planted squarely in the middle of the road. While Nirvana was characterized by punk's sound as much as its ethos, Soundgarden had one foot in contemporary metal, Smashing Pumpkins mixed 80s goth and new wave in with their glam, and Green Day, NIN, and the RHCP were clearly creatures of the post-punk era, Pearl Jam was always a classic rock band, the one alt-nation superstar that completely ignored both punk and its aftermath.  Pearl Jam were all solos and riffs and lighters-aloft, arena-rock sentiment; like so many 60s rockers, they looked to the Asian sub-continent for their first flirtations with ""growth"" and ""maturity""; they even cuddled up to the ""right"" rock 'n' roll architects (Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, Neil Young).  To claim Pearl Jam as the greatest rock band of our time-- as many listeners and critics do-- is virtually a negation of the past 30 years of guitar-based music, a relieved sigh that the values of the 70s aren't completely lost.</p><p>
    
    And... that works for a lot of people.  Pearl Jam struck chords within listeners like few of their contemporaries.  Those diehards probably looked at the <i>Rearviewmirror</i> tracklist and chuckled, wondering why it didn't include this rarity or that B-side (it does have a few key ones, e.g. ""Yellow Ledbetter"") or a handful of what the album rock stations used to call ""deep cuts.""  This comp isn't for them, though; it's for the rest of us, and a lot of listeners will likely glance at it, wonder where the hell ""Crazy Mary"" is, and consider it a handy career-spanner-- all the Pearl Jam they'll ever need.  If they buy it, those listeners will likely be surprised that-- despite some non-descript titles (""Corduroy"", ""Go"", ""Immortality"", the title track)-- they remember most of these tracks, and despite slipping well below the radar, the band has, in many ways, improved over the years.</p><p>
    
    The record seemingly begins the same way as their debut, <i>Ten</i>, but this version of ""Once"" (like ""Alive"" and ""Black"") has been slightly re-mixed by Brendan O'Brien.  Hardly radical and barely noticeable, the new versions buff the shine from the originals, actually improving three of the band's better, more melodic early tracks.  On the album's first disc, the band's years of popularity-- through third album <i>Vitalogy</i>-- are only highlighted by the <i>Singles</i> track ""State of Love and Trust"" and the forceful ""Not For You"".</p><p>
    
    A lot of the other big guns are better left unremembered: The five-against-one mutterings of ""Animal""; ""Evenflow"", ""Rearviewmirror"", and ""Go"" plod along, monuments to the appropriateness of the tag ""grunge""; ""Spin the Black Circle"" is their first step toward the clumsy romanticism of bygone days; and ""Jeremy"" remains as painful as ever.  Perhaps that last track is only truly powerful when coupled with images of Vedder's emotive pantomimes, hard-scrawled title cards that say things like ""the serpent was subtil [sic]"" and ""90210"", or a shirtless boy both wrapped in the American flag and standing in front of a wall of flames and crouching in the woods in front of an overblown photo of a teeth-baring fox...</p><p>
    
    On the up side, the garage-esque ""Do the Evolution"" is either over-the-top fun or completely ridiculous, depending on whether or not you believe Pearl Jam actually possess a sense of humor (in this case, I think it's the former), and ""I Got Shit"" (formerly ""I Got ID""), ""Save You"", and ""Hail, Hail"" have a few more shades than the gray of the band's grunge era.</p><p>
    
    On the way down, things are also scattered.  Like they do on the early rockers, Vedder's vocal diversions, tics, and lack of enunciation occasionally move from exaggerated emoting into self-parody (see, in particular, ""Given to Fly""). His voice is still the band's hallmark sound-- a mealy-mouthed, gravely style that influenced a decade of really, really shitty music-- and it's still fun to impersonate; unfortunately, on pain-wracked attempts to convey more universal emotions (the glib ""Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town"", the lyrical disaster ""Wishlist"", ""Better Man"", the awkward cover of ""Last Kiss""), it's not very fun to listen to.</p><p>
    
    Even when Eddie's opening his mouth, the tunes are often excruciatingly drab dirges-- ""Immortality"" and ""Nothingman"" are the biggest offenders. (Yet ironically, the most overtly dirge-like track-- the almost mantra-esque, Eastern-tinged ""Who You Are""-- is one of the set's most effective.) Elsewhere, the patient ""Off He Goes"", ""Nothing As It Seems"", and ""Man of the Hour"" and the solipsistic ""I Am Mine"" all carry a more weathered, wise sense of self, and these tracks greatly upstage the more youthful and clumsy neo-emoisms of the band's better known songs-- in particular its ballads.</p><p>
    
    In some ways, it makes sense that Pearl Jam are improving as they slip further from the gaze of contemporary listeners and into the neolithic caves of mid-70s classic rock.  For all the harm it unwittingly did to rock radio-- and for as comical as it can be in its most unchecked moments-- Vedder's voice is powerful and can even be captivating. The more considered and time-tested tones it now carries fit the band's more subtle shading.</p><p>
    
    In full ham-fisted stadium rock mode, Pearl Jam now oddly seem miles away from Nirvana, still the best of their one-time Seattle contemporaries. Instead, they're not-so-distant cousins to the denim brigade, the faceless 70s arena rockers who dutifully punched time clocks and produced no-nonsense, sometimes hook-filled rock.  Today, Pearl Jam seems bruised, ever so slightly more adventurous, and, thanks to the devotion of their fans, they're afforded the chance to dress up as rock iconoclasts rather than take a slide toward VH1-ready adult contemporary balladry. It's like punk never happened.</p></div>"|6209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6209-rearviewmirror-greatest-hits-1991-2003/|5.9|Scott Plagenhoef

Unlike the easily corralled fuzz addicts ensconced in the monolithic grunge pantheon, you really ought to modify ""psych"" to make it work.</p><p>
    
    Enter The Gris Gris. They don't wrap their music in nature-friendly drone, the white-eyed haze of noisy star-melting sprawl, or the autumnal cartwheels of lo-fi acid-folk; instead, they drape themselves in classy, gauzy atmospherics that gurgle with small-scale, somehow gentle freak-outs and downcast hooks.</p><p>
    
    The Gris Gris are Bay Area residents but their take on the 60s is miles apart from most of San Francisco's candle melting mystics. The band's Oakland-via-Texas frontman Greg Ashley is more <i>Musician</i> magazine magpie than Harry Partch channeler. Tellingly, while the band's name does connote a so-called ""iron-fisted"" form of voodoo ceremonials, the more earthbound Ashley grabbed the term from Dr. John's first record rather than a magic talisman.</p><p>
    
    Recorded on an 8-track machine with half-inch tape in a three-room cement basement, the strongest aspect of this debut is its authentic mustiness. The group bows at a dark pantheon-- the spirits of Roky Erickson, The Electric Prunes, Velvet Underground, Syd Barrett, and The Rolling Stones all make appearances. Staying closer to the present, consider The Gris Gris a less cryptically insular Brother JT with a penchant for Galaxie 500.</p><p>
    
    Unlike their forefathers' black-lit laboratories, the quartet often feels emotionally vacant. It's not that the words are fatuous, clunky, embarrassing, or overwrought-- they just kinda are. Even during Ashley's most baroquely reverb-bathed lamentations, he best locates his emotional mojo in his guitar pick rather than his run-of-the-mill sentiments. This isn't necessary a death-knell; the fluidity of his musicality is detailed enough to fill those gaps with a squall of melancholy sounds: minor chords, rapturous feedback, ghostly organ. But, hey, as Extreme wisely put it back in the day, sometimes other things can be more valuable than words.</p><p>
    
    For instance, Ashley and crew possess the skills to uncover pleasing results when they wander over hills of non-vocal music. There, some of The Gris-Gris' compositions are allowed the space to ramble: The eight-plus minute ""Raygun"" could continue the lonesome path of its first two minutes ad infinitum if Ashley felt the need; instead, it rocks loose from a <i>This Is Our Music</i> guitar/voice jangle, raising a bubbling, flanging ruckus, like an crumbling aircraft ascending from a rusted silo. It's the sonic equivalent of a contact mic making out with a jar of silly string. ""Me Queda Um Bejou"" opens with a bluster until it drops a step and becomes a lovely Portuguese enchanter, a moody blue come-on that, at its midpoint, slides along a melodic saxophone. The incidental piece, ""Plain Vanilla"", blends castanets and string plucks to create windy circus music trapped in a hurricane. ""Best Regards"" flinches and fizzles with the nervous energy of The 13th Floor Elevators until Ashley begins some sort of dark cloud exorcism to the fore-- and, again, once he stops talking, the guitar theatrics really take off, this time screeching, drilling, and howling over a tight, distant rhythm section.</p><p>
    
    But in the end, even those pale, cascading salvos just aren't enough to sustain interest. A number of tunes glisten, but as you grow familiar with the aura, the more it fades. Ultimately, I want to loop the best moments and pretend Ashley doesn't return to break what's left of the spell. A songwriter needn't be a literary lion but in this case, the lack of a back story, esoteric insight, charmed charisma, or soothsayer actualization renders The Gris Gris, more or less, a solid bar band with a great list of influences.</p></div>"|3658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3658-the-gris-gris/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

Allow me to illustrate: nobody has ever written 10 words about Franz Ferdinand without five of them being ""archduke,"" ""assassination"", and ""First World War."" Consider, then, Brooklyn's Barbez, a mainstay of the John Zorn-impacted downtown NYC scene and recent signees to Important Records: (1) Their frontwoman is a Russian avant-garde dancer, (2) They have a theremin, (3) The theremin is not used for whooshy space sounds but actually <em>played</em> by a cigarette-smoking waif virtuoso who makes it sound like an entire string section, (4) They cover Kurt Weill, (5) and Schnittke, (6) They lug around a monstrous marimba, and (7) A band member coaxes scratches and squiggles out of a Palm Pilot via a proprietary piece of software. As you may imagine, every attempt at describing Barbez devolves into ritual recitation of these factoids in random order, and before you know it, your allotted 500 words are over.</p><p>
    
    So let's talk about the music, then. The songs oscillate from tra-la-la chanson to brief explosions of terrifying skronk, hitting everything in between. Although sometimes flamboyant with mid-song tempo and time signature changes, Barbez don't come across as mathy: they're going for controlled chaos, not athletics. The impression is that of a century's worth of vinyl disintegrating in a cellar-- Satie melting into The Stooges-- then somehow willing itself back together. ""The Defiant Bicycle"", the centerpiece of the album and most of their live performances, is a gorgeous suite that takes so much time to build that the listener's masochistic response (per Masoch's definition of masochism, as delayed pleasure) almost becomes a counterpoint. ""Wisconsin""-- songwriter and bandleader Dan Kaufman's ode to his surprisingly prosaic birthplace-- is the closest Barbez come to a traditional <em>lied</em> (via the Residents, perhaps).</p><p>
    
    The band's self-titled debut on Important is, in fact, their third album (before employing the blonde tornado named Ksenia Vidyaykina, they were fronted by a man with an uncanny Nick Cave bellow, which made the Weimar fetish come through stronger but shaved off some originality points). They've been playing some of the album's songs since 1999; as a result, there's a honed, easy dexterity to the entire performance. Producer Martin Bisi, who's made his name recording Swans and early Sonic Youth, appears less to have produced the album than to have captured it; it's recorded and mixed like a jazz LP-- grounded in a well-defined, specific room, without dramatic panning and loads of what sounds like natural basement reverb.</p><p>
    
    All theremin-and-Weill trivia aside, what's rather intriguing about Barbez is that a band like this would never come out of the Parisian neighborhood from which its name derives; it also couldn't have possibly emerged from any of the countries whose music and perceived ambience it references/absorbs/bites-- namely Russia, Hungary, or Poland. The sound of Barbez is driven by a distinctly American strain of Europhilia. In a cultural moment when thinking East Coasters are swept up in a bizarre cross-Atlantic camaraderie, borne of the shared November 3rd funk (one entry on sorryeverybody.com: ""Apologies from Isle of New York, off the coast of Europe""), Barbez provide a pitch-perfect soundtrack to the intelligentsia identity crisis.</p></div>"|1140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1140-barbez/|8.0|Michael Idov

The band-- named for a river outside St. Petersburg, Russia-- filled last year's eye-opening <i>Down the River of Golden Dreams</i> with gentle ballads about beds and war criminals and forgiveness, but the songs on their follow-up EP, <i>Sleep and Wake Up Songs</i>, are more brittle and fragile, like a light sleeper's snooze. The EP condenses the album's best qualities and discards most of its weaknesses, and its brevity makes it all the more emotionally forceful.</p><p>
    
    ""Rapt, in Star Wars sheets/ With my hand across your belly/ We waded through the watercolor,"" Will Sheff sings on opener ""A Favor"". The song hints at a life of sexual confusion and parental abandonment, hinging on a chorus that alludes to the impossibility of true human connection: ""I would be anything that you wanted me to be...but how can I change my body?""</p><p>
    
    Plumbing the disappointment of unrealized dreams, these songs are bleak and often desperate. They traffic in deliberately nebulous narratives-- unnamed characters, unspecified relationships, vague actions, undisclosed emotions-- anchored by concrete details. The result is a dreamlike atmosphere, simultaneously blurred and lucid. ""You're Untied Again"" turns the adage ""if you love something, set it free"" on its head, but Sheff is more interested in evoking the chill of an unreachable beach or the darkness of a diamond mine-- both of which become potent metaphors for the confinement of a relationship.</p><p>
    
    With an acoustic guitar melody as prismatic as melting icicles, ""Just Give Me Time"" plumbs the tension at the heart of a relationship, but the lyrics are so opaque as to be coded: ""I shut my eyes, ripped the train off the line/ But a sudden gust of snow blew through a hole in my girl's clothes."" This is not necessarily a criticism: refusing to provide much context for their narratives, these songs are guardedly confessional, eager to elicit emotions but hesitant to reveal too much.</p><p>
    
    To compliment this mood, the instruments sound sleepily languid, lolling around the beat rather than hitting it precisely. ""A Favor"" builds gradually to a climax reminiscent of ""The War Criminal Rises and Speaks"" from <i>Down the River of Golden Dreams</i>, but only the vocals crescendo. The other instruments maintain the same volume, as if nonplussed by Sheff's display of emotion. As a result, the song's climax becomes airily anticlimactic, further emphasizing the sense of lonely futility described in the lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Closing the EP, ""The Hidden Track"" sets up an intriguing musical metaphor: Life itself is an album, but the afterlife is the unlisted bonus song. After questioning and doubting himself throughout the song-- and suffering through what sounds like tremendous uncertainty-- Sheff admits, ""I think that there's a hidden track."" The song provides an upbeat coda to match his hopefulness, then the EP abruptly and unceremoniously ends.</p></div>"|5962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5962-sleep-and-wake-up-songs-ep/|7.7|Stephen Deusner

In fact, the instrumental four-piece band confines itself to relatively conventional time signatures on its third EP, <i>B</i>, a record steeped in heavy funk and craggy post-rock. But let's not beat around the bush-- Williams is still a guitar powerhouse and, placed alongside the reliably inventive Tyondai Braxton, plus David Konopka's guitar work and John Stanier's striated drum grooves, he's infallible-- like Barry Bonds in a lineup that won't let you pitch around him.</p><p>
    
    Battles thrive on the energy of a group of musicians being dead-aim tight, synced to the point where it almost doesn't matter what they're playing. Their instruments are tuned to be as crisp and dry as possible, reducing the margin for error within their playing. Without the gloss of overtones, every misstep leaves a glaring red tracer; amazingly, such marks are rarely seen on <i>B</i>, and when one is, it's so faint that it could pass for a deliberate impression (a staggered flam, for instance).</p><p>
    
    Virtuosic playing aside, Battles' guitar sounds are unlike those of most of their contemporaries. Placed in a more conventional sonic setting, these songs could take on an entirely different texture, but as such they're exhilaratingly off-kilter. Williams, Braxton, and Konopka sound hazy and low-res, only without the static and hissing that accompanies many poor quality recordings. Alternately guttural and glistening, ""SZ2"" opens in a formless haze of fingerings before falling into a pensive, slightly shuffled melody. In contrast to the totemic <i>EP C</i>, Battles here sound acquiescent, as if they're stepping down from the groove-heavy jams of that record into more texture-based territory. But then Stanier enters with an impossibly huge drum fill, splintering the subdued mood and booting the song awake.</p><p>
    
    The ensuing seven minutes are <i>B</i>'s strongest. Battles are impressive musicians, but the real key to these songs is restraint, and ""SZ2"" presents its selling points in a humble manner that amounts to a vastly greater whole. Unlike in Don Cab, Williams' polymathic high-wire acts are understated; they play a foundational role. Meanwhile, Stanier pounds tight-wound grooves that handle big dynamics with phenomenal sensitivity. That one-two punch is the crux of ""SZ2"", which at first taunts and pounds its chest, then backs off, performs a quick turnabout, and skitters away in lithe 3-against-4 trot.</p><p>
    
    This record is a companion to this summer's <i>Tras</i> and <i>EP C</i>, and its five songs explore, hone, and paraphrase material from those two releases. Like minimalist composers, the band work in subtle variations, treating previously recorded songs as constantly evolving entities. ""TRAS3"" isolates the girding guitar riff from <i>Tras</i>'s title track, and bathes it in echo, creating a nice arrhythmic segue after the unrelenting nine-minute opener. ""IPT2"" intercepts a track of the same name from <i>EP C</i>, removing its heavily processed drums. ""Dance"" is a strong closer; it has another insistent Stanier drum loop and vamps on an organ melody that sounds like a twisted seventh-inning stretch.</p><p>
    
    Battles' Achilles' heel is their penchant for abstruseness, witnessed here by ""BTTLS"", a plodding ambient collage built of fragmented, heavily-processed percussion clips and a smattering of tinny, modem-like squalls. At 12 minutes, the song has plenty of time to find its stride, but never really manages to do so. Perhaps Battles are miserably self-conscious, and they feel the need to try to conflate their musical strengths with an aloof intellectualism-- after all, the similarly meandering, melody-vacant ""Fantasy"" bogged down <i>Tras</i>, and the band's cryptic song titles provide unneeded obfuscation. Had they done without the outre bloviating of these more experimental numbers, the band likely wouldn't have had enough material for three separate EPs. Rather, they could have put together a leak-proof full-length of their best tracks-- and saved fans about $20.</p></div>"|1120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1120-b-ep/|8.3|Sam Ubl

Skeptics: name another genre that has its own brand of potato chips, or counts as heroes men named Notorious B.I.G. and Big Pun and Puffy and Fat Joe and Raekwon the Chef, or singlehandedly stabilized a dying French wine town with an MTV spot and a few choice Diddies. Foodtalk is facile shorthand, and after 15 years in the game, MF Doom has had his share of Warren G Cheezie Nachos and Master P Platinum BBQ Rap Snacks. But when hip-hop got fat and gangsta and lucrative-- as well as massively important, culturally influential, and-- Doom kept low, disgruntled by what he saw as big-money rap's new self-importance. ""Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck/ And still keep your attitude on self-destruct,"" Doom would say later in ""Rhymes Like Dimes"". By 1993, rap had toasted to <i>The Chronic</i>, <i>Illmatic</i>, and <i>36 Chambers</i>; had it been released then, KMD's pointed and confrontational <i>Black Bastards</i> would have sounded but a wolf cry while the rest of hip-hop was taking its first sips of gin and juice.</p><p>
    
    ""There are different topics besides murdering everybody. That seems to be the in thing-- how many people you can murder on a record. So I'm bringing it back to the old, bragging about how nice you are with the words."" Doom said this on NPR in 2003, but the sentiment holds true for his 1999 comeback solo full-length <i>Operation: Doomsday</i>. Like other rap heavyweights at the time, Doom promised world domination, but with tongue firmly in cheek, making tall boasts only to undermine them with nerdy self-deprecation and high-falutant science-fiction soap-ops. Doom ""came to destroy rap"" because rap had betrayed itself: <i>Operation: Doomsday</i> was the story of-- and vehicle for-- his return-to-roots revenge.</p><p>
    
    ""Operation Doomsday complete,"" we're told in the opening sound collage of <i>Mm..Food?</i>. As an official follow-up to <i>Operation: Doomsday</i>, <i>Mm..Food?</i> is an attempt to make good on Doom's almost fascist conceit to restore rap's golden age despite its loss of innocence. While Doom doesn't drop strictly food-related rhymes, the album's subject matter is always commonplace: friends, sucka MCs, girls, weed, and hip-hop. Post <i>Doomsday</i>, MF Doom as MF Doom has no interest in the space-laser rapocalypse of King Geedorah's <i>Take Me To Your Leader</i> or the dysfunctional gangster whim of Madvillain's <i>Madvillainy</i>. Here Doom wants nothing more than to score some Clever Points with quirky one-liners over tight beats.</p><p>
    
    ""On his own throne, the boss like King Koopa"", Doom spits silver dollars like a subway-card dispenser, but he also loosens his mask a bit for a few tender bleats: ""Look like a black wookie when he keeps his hair low,"" he confesses on ""Beef Rapp"". There aren't as many belly laughs on <i>Mm..Food?</i> as there were on <i>VV1</i> or <i>Madvillainy</i>, but Doom does manage this spam-mail slam on ""Kookies"": ""Supposed to be checkin e-mails/ All I got is messages from ass naked females [cookies]/ I don't know no Jenny, she said it's free/ And I won't owe her a penny, and that's the last time I saw her/ But thousands of more horrors are on line (Gomorrah...)"". Unlike <i>Doomsday</i>, guest spots are smartly kept to a minimum, though in fairness, ""Rapp Snitch Knishes"" co-emcee Mr. Fantastik hardly embarrasses himself: ""True to the ski mask New York's my origin/ Play a fake gangsta like a old accordian.""</p><p>
    
    Most of Doom's raps on <i>Mm..Food?</i> sacrifice cohesion for maximum punch. When Doom does muster some self-restraint, he comes off triply brilliant. From the beginning, the Count Bass-D production ""Potholderz"" darts back and forth across the metaphor until we simply can't tell whether Doom's talking about gloves or roach clips: ""What-- these old things?/ About to throw them away with the gold rings that make them don't fit like OJ"". The Whodini sample on ""Deep Fried Frenz"" is awful in that purposeful maybe-Eminem sort of way. Here Doom turns a feel-good song into a mess of betrayal, bitterness, and matter-of-fact credos: ""You could either ignore this advice, or take it from me/ Be too nice and people take you for a dummy.""</p><p>
    
    With the exception of the album's two older tracks-- the Madlib-produced, Madvillainy leftover ""One Beer"" and the PNS-produced ""Yee Haw"", here re-recorded as ""Kon Queso""-- and ""Potholderz"", Doom controls all the production on <i>Mm..Food?</i>. A lot of these beats are old no-frills <i>Special Herbs</i> loops, most lacking the marks of Doom's science-fiction fetish. Of the newer beats, the 70s Blue Note funk on ""Vomitspit"" is up there with Doom's best production work, and the stuttery ""Potholderz"" has the best bassline on any hip-hop album this year. Doom is also one of the few producers who should be allowed to do sound collage skits: ""Poo-Putt Platter"" has sample sequences that at one point reads, ""'You risked your life for us.' 'Thanks.' 'I've lost an arm.' 'Good.' 'Stop it father!'"" One skit would have been plenty though; instead, Doom dumps four of these right in the middle of the album, a nasty rut that makes <i>Mm..Food?</i> pretty much unplayable front-to-back after the first few spins, especially since the tracks that follow these skits-- the elevator-rap ""Kon Karne"" and the maudlin ""Guinnesses""-- are among Doom's worst.</p><p>
    
    If <i>Mm..Food?</i> feels merely good or somewhat inconsequential, it's because it is that way by design. Doom has no pretense here-- he's an equally great rapper and producer, and he wants people to respect him for his skills alone: ""It's about the beats/ Not about the streets and who food he about to eat"". On one hand we can admire his intentions; on the other we can criticize his pigheadedness. Hip-hop can be consequential and important when it wants to be, and perhaps the capable Doom is keeping his aspirations too far in check. The truth is that Doom could go on making five or six <i>Mm..Food?</i>'s each year for the rest of his career-- but when will ""merely good"" not be good enough?</p></div>"|5255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5255-mmfood/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

But Wainwright's inspiration has never quite matched his devotion to the project, and this baroque setting is not entirely suitable for his considerable talents. He has a distinctive voice that imbued his first two albums with an instantly recognizable personality; yet, although he seems suited to show tunes and post-SoCal pop, his voice is lost among the flourishes of harp and harpsichord in the <i>Want</i> series. Even Wainwright's songwriting seems to suffer: his usually sparkling wit seems deadened by the weight of the music; his melodies lag, burdened by the profundity of their mission.</p><p>
    
    The songs on last year's <i>Want One</i> sounded leaden under their overlush arrangements, and <i>Want Two</i> doesn't improve on that formula. If anything, it is a darker, more meditative sequel, less lively but more fragile and sensitive to the cruelties of a vicious world-- tragedy to its precursor's comedy. The album opens unpromisingly-- almost hostilely-- with the nearly six-minute ""Agnus Dei"", an overture full of gently pulsating strings and Latin lyrics. The song isn't just singularly dull, but it reveals the weaknesses of these sessions. Wainwright's gauzy vocals aren't particularly suited for this style of melodramatic music and often come across as disaffected or, worse, disengaged. Furthermore, the obsessiveness of his artistic vision often threatens to alienate his listeners through overlong songs and esoteric production.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, ""The One You Love"" quickly corrects the album's course, harking back to Wainwright's first two albums. It blends gently swaying pop with an angelic choir and the dulcimer-like guitar on 
    the chorus, and shows off his gifts for introspective lyrics full of biting wit and for arrangements that are all the more dramatic for being understated. Songs like ""This Love Affair"", ""Gay Messiah"", and ""Crumb by Crumb""-- which could have come from either of his previous albums-- only reinforce this impression.</p><p>
    
    However, the <i>Want</i> sensibility-- music as theatrical stage setting-- resurfaces throughout the album: in the recorder melody on ""Hometown Waltz"", in the chamber strings on ""Little Sister"", in the eddying instrumentation of the Jeff Buckley eulogy ""Memphis Skyline"". These songs seem uniformly static. Only the live recording of ""The Art Teacher"" manages to break form: Over a Philip Glass prism of piano chords, a plaintive horn, and a slightly sped-up tempo, Wainwright tells of a woman remembering her first love, the instructor of the title who turned her on to Romantic painter J.M.W. Turner.</p><p>
    
    In a sense, the <i>Want</i> project sounds perfectly suited to Wainwright's ability to confront his problems through lyrical witticisms and to intensify all emotions-- especially romantic longings-- to an operatic level. But His tragedies remain exclusively personal; they rarely, if ever, extend to any community, gay or otherwise, and the songs derive some power from their insistently individual scope. On ""Waiting for a Dream"", Wainwright sings in the first verse: ""You are not my lover, and you never will be/ Cause you've never done anything to hurt me."" The ""Gay Messiah"" mixes gay and Christian iconography, but the Savior-- who is ""reborn from 1970s porn""-- is Wainwright's own personal Jesus; he even proclaims himself ""Rufus the Baptist"" and turns the refrain ""The gay messiah is coming"" into frank wordplay.</p><p>
    
    Wainwright's obsession and self-destructive tendencies extend to his music as well, sabotaging the <i>Want</i> project but making both albums fascinating, even moving, in a peculiar way. Watching such an undeniably talented artist blindly follow such an errant muse can be endlessly compelling, and the failure of these two albums to capture his visions and ambitions with any adequacy possesses the pull of true tragedy. This doesn't necessarily elevate the music, but it does present Wainwright as both the fated tragic hero and the sexually ambiguous victim of the two album covers and it does recast the project as a small triumph within an extended train wreck.</p></div>"|8559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8559-want-two/|6.0|Stephen Deusner

Boards' take on electronic music is so eminent and frequently imitated that it's become almost a sub-genre in itself. Their seal of approval is a valuable currency, and their scintillating ambience is a clear influence on Bibio's music. So is the fractured mien of esoteric electronic acts like Aphex Twin and Autechre, who Bibio discovered while studying music at the University of London. Of these three influences, Autechre is the most cold and sterile; Boards the most emotive, although in this sort of music, emotion generally manifests as a tension between human desire and artificial systems-- the raw stuff of feeling abstracted and viewed through a microscope. It seems to say: this is what it would feel like to feel, were genuine emotion possible in an age of ramifying obsolescence.</p><p>
    
    To that end, Bibio inflates his music with more verdure and humanity than any of the aforementioned acts, as a large part of his style involves yoking heavily processed electronics to pastoral guitar lines and natural found sound, liked a glitched-out Windsor for the Derby. ""Bibio"", apparently, is the name of a fishing lure Wilkinson's father used on trips to Wales where a young Stephen developed his love of natural sounds. Surprisingly, his naturalist aesthetic rubs placidly against the ambient disarray of his debut, <em>fi</em>, a shoegazing drone that pays homage to the natural world simply by documenting it-- by listening, a simple thing that many of us often forget to do. Bibio sometimes veers toward the vanishing minimalism of Keith Fullerton Whitman, as on opening track ""Cherry Blossom Road"", where a quiet, beatific synth tone wraps around itself again and again. But just as often, he indulges a sort of breathy melodicism, as on the gleaming arpeggios of ""Bewley in White"" and ""Looking Through the Facets of a Plastic Jewel"".</p><p>
    
    The album is not abrasive; in fact, it's soothing, but it is also saturated with distortion and synthetic effects that seem to represent technology's degradation of the equilibrium of ecological cycles. Or perhaps the modulating crackle winding through the idyllic guitar lines, birdsongs, and ambient wind effects represents nothing less than the human virus that creates the technology, which will eventually annihilate those tenuous, fragile sounds-- a paranoid but viable vision with which Boards of Canada, too, seem familiar. But Bibio forgoes Boards' precise rhythmic thrust in favor of more meandering, ramshackle compositions that paint ephemeral imagery in broad strokes of primary colors, wafting through your peripheral vision. His analog bent and penchant for lo-fi, malfunctioning equipment bestow upon <em>fi</em> an aura of intimacy and transparency, where each sound that comprises the spacious armatures is discernible. It's a familiar formula-- begin in serenity, introduce conflict, watch the theoretical dimensions unfurl-- which Bibio, with his naturalist's disposition, eases through with a delicate and appreciative eye. One imagines strolling through a dewy glade and finding HTML tags, instead of lovers' initials, carved into the trees.</p></div>"|1137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1137-fi/|7.3|Brian Howe

Its premise: commercial jingles are the soundtrack to modern life. Such memes of social control are never more than a minute long. Therefore, The Residents concocted 40 one-minute ditties-- technically ""commercial[s]."" Never mind that the iconic, San Francisco freak-show rockers sell nothing and rarely implant Pavlovian bells in consumer minds.

    Mute recently reissued this train that, when it was first released in 1980, barely skidded off the track. Also included is a booklet of lyrics and rather awkward-looking CG art from its admirable DVD edition's 56 music videos from various prey of The Residents' spell. Special note: the Residents directed what are supposedly the earliest music videos, for <i>Commercial</i>. Some of them are on permanent display at New York's Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>
    
    If anything, The Residents usually create the perfect soundtrack for fever dreams. During that condition, to stare at a pile of dirty clothes or one's moonlit shadow is to trigger delusions about living among beasts. The Residents' grotesqueries follow the same logic-- although their creations are oddly adorable like the creatures that inhabit Edward Gorey's ""Utter Zoo Alphabet"".</p><p>
    
    To sit through <i>Commercial</i>'s 40 synthesizer'n'piecemeal percussion tunes of carnival barker serenades, bedeviled Zappa jaunts, Babylonian cabaret, and bastardized Chinese operas may disturb the stomach. It is arguably the Residents' last great album before descending into 15 years of desperate weird for weirdness' sake pretension. As mentioned before, nothing here remotely resembles a ""commercial"" for anything-- their last product placement was for Coca-Cola in their 1979 ethnodelic masterpiece <i>Eskimo</i>, where their Westernized Aleutian characters bleated ""Coca Cola adds life!""</p><p>
    
    Given <i>Commercial</i>'s volume, it's inevitably hit-or-miss-- although these poor sods should be immunized from falling in love. Witness their lopsided tap-dance number, ""Love Is..."" where they robotically chant, ""Love is only loneliness divided by another love is only living for the lonely love is only loneliness divided by another and I know that life is lonely."" Whomever in the anonymous band sings is either a nasally congested, good 'ol boy or a female music teacher for second-graders. They best gel in the Hee Haw Chinese opera of ""Amber"". Other highlights include the psychotramatic lullaby of ""The Talk of Creatures"", the literally glass-shattering gutbucket blues of ""The Coming of the Crow"", and the Martian Beatles doo-wop of ""The Simple Song"".</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Commercial</i> recycles the formula of demented, calliope-style melodies on whiny synthesizers and vocal histrionics that would've intoxicated Harry Smith had The Residents blew jugs and plucked banjos in northern Louisiana in 1952. To avoid indigestion, do not eat the whole thing.</p></div>"|6766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6766-the-commercial-album-25th-anniversary-edition/|7.0|Cameron Macdonald

So now, months later, Talbot and his Gravenhurst mates return with <i>Black Holes in the Sand</i>, an ambitious EP on which they plunge headlong into more traditional folk themes and styles, almost as if to say ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.""</p><p>
    
    Containing six songs and running just over 30 minutes ling, <i>Black Holes in the Sand</i> is just a whisker shy of what was once known as an album. While previous Gravenhurst records have essentially been solo affairs, here Talbot is joined throughout by drummer Dave Collingwood and instrumentalist Paul Nash. Their collective sound remains spare, however, and it's still unmistakably Talbot's show, and on these songs his talents are given ample opportunity to flourish in the limelight.</p><p>
    
    The track which best typifies Gravenhurst's increased emphasis on tradition is ""Flowers in Her Hair"". Over exquisite Bert Jansch-like fingerpicking, Talbot tells the haunting tale of a young woman, burned by her townspeople as a witch, whose ghost returns to seek a little good old-fashioned payback. ""Everyone you know/ Will be crawling through the snow/ At the four furthest corners of town/ Where they buried my bones,"" he sings as just the sparest hints of feedback provide the appropriate degree of wintry wind. It's a spellbinding performance, and a song that harkens back powerfully to the olde English ballads collected by Francis James Child.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, on songs like the title track or ""Winter Moon"", Talbot holds forth on our modern disconnect with the natural world-singing of mountains, trees, and frozen fields while ""In our rooms beside the fire/ We drink unaware of all nature's forces in our lives."" On these tracks he permits the occasional instrumental indulgence-- like a warm patch of droning organ or crisp electric guitar jangle-- to intrude upon his otherwise pristine vocals and acoustic guitar. (His pearly voice is in such mint condition here that its lack of burrs or scratches almost becomes a distraction on some of the EP's more emotive numbers.)</p><p>
    
    About the only track that doesn't work is the recasting of Husker Du's ""Diane"" as a gentle acoustic murder ballad. Though this cover may sound like a slam-dunk on paper, it falls irretrievably flat in practice, as Grant Hart's blunt lyrics (""We could cruise down Robert Street all night long/ I think I'll just rape you and kill you instead"") sound hopelessly unpoetic when shorn of the rabid electricity which buried them on <i>Metal Circus</i>.</p><p>
    
    Closing the record is the pleasant but uneventful instrumental ""Flashlight Seasons"", on which guitar feedback and organ blend to end matters with a polite nod towards Talbot's old Bristol faves Flying Saucer Attack. It's an unexpectedly demure finale, and one that feels quite anti-climatic after <i>Blacks Holes in the Sand</i> has hit such charged heights of intensity. And when finished, it can't help but leave you wondering whether or not we've yet been allowed the best vantage point to witness the varied aspects of Gravenhurst's still-splintered personality.</p></div>"|3641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3641-black-holes-in-the-sand/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

Far from being merely associated with cartoons, The Apples in Stereo spent the beginning of the decade on the verge of actually becoming a cartoon, for all intents and purposes. They had always been a sort of caffeinated children's band for adults, content to sing about glowworms and UFOs in their signature lo-tech hi-fi sonic environment while frontman Robert Schneider enjoyed his kingpin status in the Elephant 6 collective. Regardless of the Apples' schedule, Schneider has never wanted for work, producing more albums than you can count and picking up whatever instrument or potentially musical object happened to be lying around and going to tape with it for some friend's band. When your friends are guys like Jeff Magnum, Bill Doss, and Will Cullen Hart, you wind up on a few classic albums, and Schneider's career looks mighty enviable to this point.</p><p>
    
    But regardless, there comes a point where you look around and you're in your thirties, risking falling into some sort of indie Raffi pigeonhole. Schneider's primary accomplice, drummer Hilary Sidney, looked around and saw it too, and The Apples went to recess a couple of years ago as each of them focused on other creative endeavors. Schneider naturally kept busy with all manner of recording work and even kept up a musical correspondence with Andy Partridge that came to no fruition, and ultimately put together Ulysses for a quick run through some new material that became <i>.010</i>. Sidney, meanwhile, sent tapes back and forth in the mail to Norwegian singer Per Ole Bratset (Palermo) and the two wound up with the tracks that became The High Water Marks' debut, <i>Songs About the Ocean</i>.</p><p>
    
    Listening to the two albums together, it's clear that The Apples needed a break, and both records have a lo-fi spontaneity that the flagship band hasn't been able to muster in ages. Schneider and Ulysses went as stripped-down as possible, recording live into a single microphone in the garage of Pet Sounds Studios, tossing a couple of vocal and synth overdubs over the top and calling it done. It's a high-risk, high-return method that trims virtually all prospective fat off of Schneider's workmanlike compositions, forcing the simple arrangements to work solely for the song at hand. Sure, the recording muddies up any time he hits his distortion pedal, there's no nuance in the drums at all, and the tapes become ridiculously saturated when the band breaks loose, but it really doesn't matter much-- Schneider's final mix presents the songs in gloriously direct mono and they're simple and catchy enough to hold up.</p><p>
    
    The Sidney/Bratset tape correspondence has a similar effect, but the relaxed time frame is reflected in its more complex and considered arrangements. With two principle vocalists trading off, there's a certain natural variety to the material. The duo have sugar-coated melodies to spare, but the songs are a little compromised over the course of a whole album simply by the fact that those melodies can slip under the surface of the recording from time to time. The fidelity also varies a lot from song to song: ""Suicide"" lumbers along under too much hiss (and Sidney struggles to be heard), but ""Sixth of July"" immediately follows with a punchy, up-front melody and some strong, bright lead guitar work from Bratset (he has a penchant for noisy, Ira Kaplan-esque soloing that, oddly enough, fits fairly well).</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, both albums are somewhat torn affairs-- their relatively spontaneous creation and pointed lack of calculation are part of the charm, but you get the idea that each record could be made great simply by revisiting the material with sharper sound and greater attention to detail. For fans of The Apples In Stereo, these records are nonetheless a no-brainer, as the songs themselves are easily up to that band's standards. Schneider in particular seems to be keen on expanding his lyrical reach here-- the lines ""Inside a pissed off prostitute/ I try to take my mind off you,"" from ""Push You Away"", just wouldn't have worked on an Apples record. If nothing else, it's good to hear him and Sidney growing up a bit, even if they had to do it apart from each other.</p></div>"|11641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11641-songs-about-the-ocean-010/|6.8|Joe Tangari

The district attorney or sheriff or whoever was on TV at some press conference; he mentioned Jackson's accusations and said, ""Like I would actually listen to that kind of music.""</p><p>
    
    What kind of music was this guy talking about?  The kind that's sold nearly 150 million records worldwide?  The kind that still packs floors at weddings, clubs, and parties?  Jackson might be a walking punchline these days, but he's also the most successful solo artist of all time, someone who's written and recorded a career's worth of unspeakably great songs.  It's not like the guy had just arrested G.G. Allin or something.  But then, Jackson has been less a pop star than a freaky curiosity for more than a decade.  His 2001 album <i>Invincible</i> bricked, as did <i>Number Ones</i>, and it's hard to imagine <i>The Ultimate Collection</i>-- his new hits-and-rarities box set-- will fare much better in the current hostile climate.</p><p>
    
    Jackson, of course, may be desperate for any sort of positive attention, any way to reclaim his legacy and remind the public that he reached a level of stratospheric fame on the strength of his music.  And a lot of the music on <i>The Ultimate Collection</i> is pretty much perfect.  The set starts on a ridiculously high note with The Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back"", an unbelievably giddy blast of infectious joy.  We don't get a whole lot of other early Jackson 5 material (no ""The Love You Save"" or ""Going Back to Indiana""), but what we do get is spectacular.  Interestingly, the set leans heavily on lesser known, later-period Jackson 5 tracks like ""Enjoy Yourself"" and ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"", which are similarly revelatory and impeccably produced elegant disco-soul
    pieces.</p><p>
    
    It's fun to hear Jackson's voice progress from the joyous, energetic whoops of his early singles to the taut, clipped, more rhythmic style of his first collaborations with producer Quincy Jones, on a pair of surprisingly solid gospel-Broadway-funk tracks from the soundtrack to <i>The Wiz</i>.  This partnership would lead to <i>Off the Wall</i>, for which Jones piled layer upon layer of glistening disco strings, itchy percolating guitars, twinkling synths, blasting horns, nasty funk bass, and sophisticated, intricate rhythms behind Jackson's fragile, chiffon voice, resulting in the single best pop album of the disco era.  Four tracks from <i>Off the Wall</i> are included here, and all of them are breathtaking, particularly the swooping, ecstatic ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"".</p><p>
    
    Jackson's next collaboration with Jones was, of course, <i>Thriller</i>, still among the best-selling albums of all time.  The set's second disc is devoted to tracks from the <i>Thriller</i> era, including five songs from the album itself, as well as a shitty lite-funk demo version of ""P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)"".  <i>Thriller</i> might be overly familiar, but most of its songs still hold up surprisingly well. ""The Girl Is Mine"", a duet with Paul McCartney, is straight-up M.O.R. vanilla bullshit (on which Jackson effortlessly outsings McCartney), but other songs remain great: the limber dance-funk of ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"", the glossy plastic bubblegum-metal of ""Beat It"", and especially the chilly, paranoid masterpiece ""Billie Jean"".  Even more than Jackson's other Quincy Jones collaborations, ""Billie Jean"" sounds incredible on headphones.  The pulsing, insistent bass, the spacey synth chimes, and the shivery descending strings perfectly support the adult Jackson's definitive vocal performance, a percussive pileup of freaked-out tics, yelps, moans, and hiccups.</p><p>
    
    The second disc also includes a whole lot of utterly godawful rarities. ""Someone in the Dark"" is a maudlin faux-Broadway ballad from the <i>E.T.</i> soundtrack that includes a bewilderingly bizarre vocal cameo from the alien himself.  It seems to be the exact moment that Jackson began to make the transition from exciting young pop star to neutered humanoid elf.  We also get a solo demo version of ""We Are the World"" and ""We Are Here to Change the World""-- the theme from Jackson's incomprehensible 3-D Disney World sci-fi opus <i>Captain EO</i>.  It's difficult to believe that someone thought these tracks were more worthy of inclusion than ""The Love You Save"".</p><p>
    
    The set picks back up again on the third disc with six tracks from <i>Bad</i>, Jackson's final collaboration with Jones.  Most of these tracks still sound great, especially the feverish, insistent ""Smooth Criminal"".  By this point, his vocal style was pretty much dominated by tourettic tics, and this new approach meshes with Jones' more rhythmic synth-funk.  Jackson's later collaborations never approached the chemistry of Jones and Jackson.  On 1991's <i>Dangerous</i>, he worked with the then-cutting edge new jack swing producer Teddy Riley, who had produced major singles for smoother, cleaner singers like Bobby Brown and Guy's Aaron Hall.  But Jackson sounds lost over the hard-edged breakbeats of ""Jam"" and the staccato keyboards of ""Remember the Time"", even though the two do find the right note on ""Who Is It (HIS Mix)"", a shivery, low-key dance track.  Meanwhile, ""Black or White""-- never Jackson's finest moment, but <i>Dangerous</i>' biggest hit nonetheless-- inexplicably includes the Macaulay Culkin/George Wendt skit from the video.</p><p>
    
    Nearly everything Jackson has done since is just terrible, making the fourth disc an unbearable slog.  Oddly, the set excludes ""Scream"", Jackson's biggest hit of the past 10 years, leaning instead on the ballads from 1996's <i>HIStory</i>-- ""You Are Not Alone"" and ""Childhood (Theme from <i>Free Willy 2</i>)"".  In comparison, the material from <i>Invincible</i> almost sounds <i>good</i>, with the album's title track riding a hard Rodney Jerkins beat, and a posthumous Biggie verse ProTooled in.  Still, nothing from this era comes within a mile of touching Jackson's best material, and all of the previously unreleased material on the disc (about half the CD), is boring to the point of being unlistenable.</p><p>
    
    The set also includes a DVD of a <i>Dangerous</i>-era concert in Bucharest, which is pretty funny.  It's a dazzlingly elaborate Disney-style greatest hits revue, more memorable for the puppet skeletons that come out during ""Thriller"" or the angel that flies over the stage for ""Will You Be There"" than for the actual music.  Jackson's dancing is still amazing, and the enormous, rapturous crowd is fun to watch, but it's hard to get around the weird gold codpiece thing Jackson wears for the first half of the show or the ridiculous homoerotic Teutonic dancers.  If Jackson was hoping to call attention back to his music, and away from his inexplicable eccentricities, it's hard to believe he'd want to include this show.</p><p>
    
    In fact, the whole set is pretty strange.  <i>The Ultimate Collection</i> doesn't make a great career overview; there's just too much extraneous crap.  It would have made a lot more sense to simply box up <i>Off the Wall</i>, <i>Thriller</i>, and <i>Bad</i> in their entireties (it's not like these albums were bloated with filler) along with a disc of Jackson 5 and early solo material and maybe a DVD of videos and early TV appearances.  The rarities and recent material drag the box down enormously, but it still does what might be its primary job: to remind us that Michael Jackson is one of the greatest pop stars of all time.</p></div>"|4350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4350-the-ultimate-collection/|8.0|Tom Breihan

RZA's off-kilter, refracted beats-- his chilly minor-key  strings, bombastic horns, and sampled film dialogue-- have become the template for NYC beatmakers, and countless Gotham MCs, if not  shamelessly jacking Raekwon's ghetto Mafioso lexicon and hard-bitten cadences, have a least a couple Wuisms tucked away in their  repertoire.  Wu-Tang were among the first emcees to capitalize on New York's mythological qualities, inflating mundane street narratives to epic bildungsromans by couching them in the tropes of their beloved Kung Fu movies and Kurosawa's Wuxia interpretations.  By reincarnating the philosophical allegories of ancient Asian drama in 20th century Staten Island (a.k.a. Shaolin), they created a rare music that could touch both thugs and suburban fantasy buffs, each on their own terms.</p><p>
    
    It's been a while since we've received a unified statement from Shaolin, so a quick roll call's in order.  The RZA, a.k.a. Bobby Digital: shogun and CEO, the bipolar spitter of metaphysical knowledge and shit-talking battle raps.  Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa: the steely growlers ballasting the more flamboyant personalities like sandbags.  Method Man: the larger-than-life MCaricature with a bottomless bag of catchphrases.  Raekwon: arguably the inventor of organized crime rap, who was cutting and flipping rhymes like weight long before every street hustler began to imagine himself a mafia don.  Ol' Dirty Bastard (RIP): a deranged parody of a soul singer, a profane, gaudy libido coming unglued.  Ghostface Killah: a gifted storyteller weaving densely coded slang, crushed out heavenly in yellow Wallabies and Wu-Wear fleece.  The GZA: a candid lyrical prodigy meting out devastatingly precise similes.  And finally, U-God: the most esoteric member of the collective, sometimes a crowd-moving party rapper, other times a dextrous prose-spitter, spinning inscrutable word collages in a velvety baritone.</p><p>
    
    Amid long-running rumors of a break-up, on July 17th, 2004, the dormant Wu reconvened at the Rock the Bells festival in San Bernadino, California, and committed to tape the 27 tracks that now constitute the career-spanning live retrospective <em>Disciples of the 36 Chambers: Chapter 1</em>.  Live hip-hop albums are rare, perhaps rightfully so: Hip-hop relies so heavily upon careful production techniques that live performances can be like tabloid photos of a sex symbols caught unawares on a trip to the beach: no make-up, cellulite showing.  And how many times have you gone to a rap show only to wait three hours for half the group to appear and watch them walk off 20 minutes later?</p><p>
    
    Miraculously, all nine original members showed up (plus a few auxiliary men, including Cappadonna).  Even the famously erratic ODB was present, and even seemingly lucid, remembering all his lines and delivering them with charisma and flair.  Dirty's recent passing is especially sad because it seemed as if he was finally getting his life back on track after all the drugs, rehab, incarcerations, and high-profile public meltdowns.  Considering the unusual amount of restraint he shows here, it's a small but pleasant consolation that his final mark upon the world was so pristine.  Regardless, each member of the Clan fell effortlessly into his role, and instead of the anonymous collective shout that live posse cuts can often become, the Wu skillfully traded lines and allowed individual members to shine, only occasionally merging into a monolithic roar that, interestingly enough, makes for a strong counterpoint to the solo verses.</p><p>
<em>Disciples of the 36 Chambers</em>'s first six tracks are a medley from Wu-Tang's classic debut, <em>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</em>.  Beginning with RZA inciting the crowd to chant the group's name, the sampled voice describing Shaolin shadow-boxing that opens ""Bring Da Ruckus"" elicits an audience howl that persists until the song morphs into early single ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin'"", then onward through ""Clan in Da Front"", ""C.R.E.A.M."" (the most famous and obvious of Wu-Tang's many embedded acronyms-- e.g., ever notice that the oft-repeated lines ""Positive energy activates constant elevation"" and ""Protons electrons always cause explosions"" spell ""P.E.A.C.E.""?), ""Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit"", and ""Shame on a Nigga"".  Wu-Tang's early work was their most skeletal and grimy, brimming with crackling electricity and an intuitive call-and-response factor, and the medley gets the crowd so amped that they could have coasted for the rest of the set.</p><p>
    
    Rather, the Wu stay on point throughout, working through classics from <em>Wu-Tang Forever</em> (""Re-United"", ""It's Yourz"", ""Triumph"", etc.) with unremitting energy, peppering those cuts with more obscure favorites from their numerous solo albums.  Raekwon turns in a faithful reproduction of ""Incarcerated Scarfaces""; his partner Ghost shines on ""Criminology"", ""Ghost Deini"", and a reworked version of ""Run"" that follows Cappadonna's original version of the same song.  The GZA concisely recreates the first verse of his classic ""Liquid Swords""; Meth struts over crowd-pleasers like ""Ice Cream"" and ""Method Man""; Dirty checks in with remarkable performances of ""Brooklyn Zoo"", ""Dog S**t"", and ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"".  Wisely, the Clan only break the furious momentum of their set a couple times to address the crowd (usually to remind them that they're witnessing an historical moment of ""real hip-hop, in its purest form""), and only draw two of the best songs from their somewhat diluted later work, ""Y'all Been Warned"" and the fizzy bounce track ""Gravel Pit"".</p><p>
    
    It's also inspiring to hear prolific rappers who are entering a relative middle age outshine their younger imitators.  On <em>Disciples of the 36 Chambers</em>, the Clan sounds hungry as ever, vicious and confident, and nowhere near depleted.  Is the Wu about to make a big comeback?  The signs are there: In his closing statements, RZA asks the crowd if they'd like to hear another Wu-Tang group album, a prospect that seemed lost to solo projects, acting roles, and deodorant commercials.  The inquiry is met with a roar of undiluted enthusiasm.</p><p>
    
    It isn't clear how Ol' Dirty Bastard's passing will effect any potential reunion plans-- it could either scupper them entirely, or galvanize the Clan to greater heights, as sudden tragedies are sometimes wont to do.  Either way, I know I'll sorely miss one of the most ostentatious and original personalities in hip-hop, and Pitchfork's heartfelt condolences are extended to his friends, family, and fellow Killa Bees.  To borrow a Dirty quote, the performance documented here is ""as high as Wu-Tang gets"", and it's comforting to know that the Dirt Dog got a final chance to bask in the spotlight that was both his lifeblood and his adversary.</p></div>"|8747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8747-disciples-of-the-36-chambers-chapter-1/|7.9|Brian Howe

For all of their high-minded explorations of the man-machine principle, Kraftwerk could still entertain any tyke. Hell, the Moog synthesizer itself has an inherent charm for ages 4-7, given its sound that seems edible. And then there's Mouse on Mars-- translating dense poststructuralist theories about rhizomes and ""bodies without organs"" into what often sounds like Saturday morning cartoon music, circa 2098. LA-based, post-techno wascal Brad Laner (Electric Company) exploits that essence on <i>Creative Playthings</i>.</p><p>
    
    Laner's 10th album is too antsy to keep any conversation-- it's bound to knock into people with abrupt dissonance but leave furrowed brows and baffled smiles in its wake. Its fructose-poisoned jaunt ""A Rainbow of Traction"" rudely embodies that element with its panicking music box melodies, feminine ""ba-ba-ba-baa"" choirs, and a wicked, faux-snake charmer flute that cuts in midway.</p><p>
    
    Such Fisher-Price psychedelia is a point that Laner has long progressed toward, this time mellowing out the glitches and lopsided song structures to concentrate more on rhythm and melody. His palette: old-school Nintendo Gameboy melodies, acoustic guitars that arise and get decapitated like dandelions in sidewalk cracks, dribbling digital-dub beats, and his own vocoderized android whispers that recall Kraftwerk's most ""human"" moments. Tackiness pervades, but it's forgivable.</p><p>
    
    Opener, ""Stand Close, Don't Flatter Yourself"", sets the template with its seasick dub rhythms and a sudden blast of over-processed guitar as if scoring a melodramatic ""game over"" screen in a video game. Laner's data-crunched guitar freakouts also liven up the otherwise faceless blip-hop of ""Is There Another Door to Door?"", the Hendrixian solo on ""Crates of Dead Orange Markers"", and the Russian-style new wave polka of ""Recalcitrant"". The aquatic drone duet between guitar and synth in ""Jarhead"" simply hypnotizes.</p><p>
<i>Creative</i>'s melodrama can be laughably bad at times. ""Theme from the Mushroom Shaped Tongue"" slaps together a preset-synth orchestra that soundtracks a direct-to-video, late-80s comedy during the scene where the hero is feeln' blue and looking for The Way, namely, ""Some crazy idea that just might work!"" ""Blue's Clues"" sappiness wrecks the whiny, ""Peter and the Wolf""-style melodies of ""She'll Be in Foal Again"".</p><p>
    
    Oddly enough, the best of <i>Creative</i> are a handful of MP3s hidden on the CD. These tracks, (all titled by Laner holding down a key like ""aaaaaaa"" and ""ccccccccc""), have little to do with the album. They instead take on rather mature experiments with chalky guitar noise, glitch-hop and a loop of a woman whispering behind one's back. There is also a 19-minute concert tape from 1998 that sounds like Laner kicking and smacking an acid-fried engine to start. Makes sense.</p></div>"|2731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2731-creative-playthings/|7.1|Cameron Macdonald

To those whose eyes are still bleary from the sting of countless hasty Joy Division allusions in the past few years, I offer a simple caveat: For all intents and purposes, Prosaics are being billed as the next Interpol. Whether or not the comparison is valid is debatable, but Matador's press unit hasn't exactly underplayed the connection: ""It's rare that we find someone who captures our imaginations the same way our established faves have. Well, not without wanting millions of dollars."" Playful tone aside, the underlying motivations here are clear.</p><p>
    
    The real problem with <i>Aghast Agape</i>, Prosaics' debut EP (originally released stateside by Dim Mak), is that the band doesn't offer any material that might diffuse accusations of straightforward stylistic photocopying. Their ethereal, angular post-punk replication is competent but anonymous, and their lyrics are epigrammatic bordering on cryptic, serving as ideal, nondescript verbal placeholders. Even their back story is pretty tepid: Two guys hang out in a NYC apt., jam a bit, hire drummer. The ""Behind the Music"" nadir of this scenario involves the mishandling of a Carl Thompson bass at the hands of a prospective band member. Compelling mythology it isn't, but appropriate for the album's relative lack of originality.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Teeth"" begins with a noisy guitar attack false start before smoothly transitioning into more pristine, driving minor key pop. The track is steeped in reverb-heavy production distantly reminiscent of early Echo and the Bunnymen, punctuated with jangling guitar lines and grounded by soaring vocal melodies by singer/guitarist Andy Comer, who wallows in affected Anglophiliac misery. The song's emotive, cryptic hook (""We preach wine/ And drink water"") establishes a pattern of passionately belted oblique phrases used for choruses on nearly every track.</p><p>
    
    Other tracks reveal more contemporary influences. ""Failure"" utilizes upbeat Franz Ferdinand-style pop for its verses, layering on wailing backing vocals for another impenetrable couplet/chorus (""Acquaintances/ Aghast agape""). ""Now the Shadow of the Column"" resembles Interpol gone power-pop, with a gritty guitar pattern overlaying a pulsating bassline until the decked-out, synth choir-spiked chorus. ""Tenants"" is a brief but redeeming conclusion. The band focuses their energy into tighter production and stronger melodic hooks-- including their best chorus-- grounded by William Kuehn's dynamic, machine-gunned drumming.</p><p>
    
    The album isn't without its moments, but nothing about <i>Aghast Agape</i> distinguishes Prosaics from the growing mass of post-punk revivalists cluttering the indie landscape. The band misses the core appeal of much of the music that inspires the album: Comer has studied Ian Curtis' despondency, but sacrifices his urgency and directness for clumsy stabs at abstruse poetry; he evokes Morrissey's deprecating anguish without the counterbalancing wit. The music is pleasant but fleeting, trapped between loving homage and faceless emulation. <i>Aghast Agape</i> establishes a stifling formula, making the band's name a bit too ironic for comfort.</p></div>"|6556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6556-aghast-agape/|6.7|David Moore

    shortlist for <i>Time</i> magazine's ""Man of the Year.""  America loves a tale of redemption almost as much
    as one of comeuppance, but at the start of the decade you'd have gotten pretty long odds on the media and
    cultural elite spinning the Marshall Mathers yarn as the former before the latter.  And yet, somewhere
    between hugging Elton onstage at the Grammys and sending that guy in the Pistons jersey to pick up his
    Oscar, Em was feted by many of America's best-known cultural crits, columnist, and pundits: Frank Rich,
    Andrew Sarris, Maureen Dowd, Greil Marcus, Neal Gabler, and Paul Slansky (among others) either laid
    garlands at his feet or rhapsodized about the supposed transformation of the rapper/actor.</p><p>
    
    The epistolary weepie ""Stan"" and the survivalist self-helpisms of ""Lose Yourself"" played a part in the
    slow mainstream media embrace of Eminem, but it's that ""slash"" that seemed to complete the embrace.  For
    whatever reason, a film career can do that-- maybe it's the ability for a lengthy narrative to be more
    explicitly mutli-dimensional or maybe it's just lazy thinking and knee-jerk reactionary assumptions about
    pop, but you're now as likely to see Em torn down on <i>Vibe</i> than <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>.</p><p>
    
    Well, Maureen, Andrew, and Greil, get ready to be excited; most of the rest of you-- the ones who've been
    held enthrall by Em's complex games of shifting his identity, challenging hypocrisy, baiting liberal guilt,
    and spitting deft rhymes with his labyrinthine flow-- prepare for disappointment: <i>Encore</i> is a fourth
    fascinating record from Eminem, but it's also easily his weakest and, in many ways, tamest album to date.</p><p>
    
    Eminem's reaction to respectability seems to have been to move in two different directions: introspection
    and reconciliation on the one side, and bodily fluid-obsessed humor on the other.  Tracks in which Em
    offers confessions, explanations, and apologies for previous comments and his participation in high-profile
    beefs share time here with belching, farting, vomiting, and urinating.  He's also scrubbed his lyrics of
    homophobia (instead, the fascinating and eyebrow-raising homoeroticism hinted at on <i>The Eminem Show</i>--
    and literally fleshed out in his music video cross-dressing-- colors a handful of his songs here) and, save
    a few blasts at Kim, any elements of misogyny.</p><p>
    
    Therefore, if <i>Encore</i> is anything, it's a transitional record.  After an image-confounding trio of
    pseudo self-titled records, the Eminem of <i>Encore</i> is wounded and weary; he's removing the layers of
    meta, still laughing and nodding but rarely winking, and not disappearing behind what <i>The Village Voice</i>'s
    Frank Kogan once labeled Em's lyrical ""trapdoors and escape hatches.""  Instead, the LP is the sound of a
    man who seems bored of re-branding and playing celebrity games, and often seems to be rapping only to
    entertain himself with little regard for any potential audience.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.
    Despite the album's pronounced maturity/infantilism divide, it's a different dichotomy that characterizes
    the album's highlights: Here, Em is at his best when he's either more focused than even before or at his
    most scattered and playful.  Unfortunately, most of the tracks that don't veer toward either extreme are
    plodding and unremarkable.</p><p>
    
    Much of the first third of the record features Eminem unloading his emotional weight.  Childhood tale
    ""Yellow Brick Road"" is the closest thing to biographical narrative he's ever done, and his remorseful
    explanation of the situation around which he, as a hurt kid, lashed out in a few racially-tinged rhymes
    at a black girl is not only compelling but effectively diffuses <i>Source</i> editor Benzino's long-running
    attack campaign on the rapper.  It's also Em's best exploration of living his life in the rare space between
    America's too-wide racial divide.  Fittingly, it leads into ""Like Toy Soldiers"", a public hand-wringing
    over the feuds that Em and 50 Cent have been drawn into, the consequences of these battles, and-- most
    importantly-- the toll they've taken, both physically and emotionally.  The martial beat is a bit heavy-handed,
    but it's counterbalanced by the pleasantly surprising chorus' sample of Martika's ""Toy Soldiers"", perhaps
    a nod to either Kanye's helium-vocaled samples or the 00s trend toward trance-pop covers of 80s hits.</p><p>
    
    Em also shines when he spins well off his axis, as he does on both the hilarious ""Rain Man"" and the R. Kelly/Triumph
    the Insult Comic Dog-baiting ""Ass Like That"", songs that both tell a lot of the same sort of celebrity- or
    redneck-oriented jokes as previous Em tracks, but have new punchlines and almost completely skip the need
    for structure.  The songs sound more like mixtape or freestyle material than album tracks, and they're
    better off for it.</p><p>
    
    Outside of those tracks and a few lively guest spots from the usual suspects (50 Cent, Nate, Dre, Obie--
    hey, where's Proof?), things get sketchy.  ""Mosh""-- sadly, not yet completely past its sell-by date-- seems
    more like a plodding dirge here among the spry string of tracks that surround it.  ""Just Lose It"" is still
    most notable for dancing with paedo and homoerotic imagery: It's the one track here that seems as potentially
    multilayered as the best of <i>The Marhsall Mathers LP</i>, yet it's still more curio than anything else.
    On one of the two Kim tracks, Em confuses domestic violence with commitment, an awkward flirtation with the
    idea that you only hurt the ones you love.  Elsewhere, with their relationship now more deteriorated than
    ever, poor Kim only rates a ""you make me puke"" where she once was murder ballad ""worthy.""</p><p>
    
    Sonically, the record is more of the same: simple minor-chord piano lines, Dre's elastic funk, Em's clicky
    and too-often weak drums.  A ""Crazy on You"" sample is wasted on a weak track (""Crazy in Love"") and the belching
    chorus of ""My 1st Single"" threatens to pulls the rug out from under an otherwise durable song.  The advantage
    of Em going back to same musical well is that he's become so adept at riding these types of beats that his
    delivery and tangible personality are compelling almost no matter what the content of his rhymes; he even
    mixes things up with drastic shifts in cadence-- sometimes within the same track-- and occasional impersonations.</p><p>
    
    In the promotional run-up to <i>Encore</i>'s release, Eminem has been dressed in his courtroom best, suits
    and wire-rims-- again, great for the Manhattan media, but another MOR flag.  At 30-plus, he's also worried
    about his legacy, trying to mobilize his version of a live-free-or-die army, and the record even drops very
    vague yet odd hints at retirement.  Em has specifically said that the curtain isn't coming down, but the
    almost afterthought with which the record is framed (packaged and titled more like an addendum to <i>The
    Eminem Show</i> rather than a follow up with a two-year gap), its jaw-droppingly weak single, and the
    smoke-and-mirrors of coasting on talent and skill indicates that he either needs a breather or a new well
    of inspiration.</p></div>"|2772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2772-encore/|6.5|Scott Plagenhoef

It's usually the most visible public figures who
    succumb first-- to political pathos, to the scrounging hands of big business-- but even the tiniest calamities are fair game when
    there's a profit to be made.  Few will argue that Nick Drake's inconspicuous career didn't deserve some special recognition after the
    folk singer's untimely death in 1974, and special recognition is what it got: first in 1986 with the odds-and-sods mix <i>Time of No
    Reply</i> and expressly introductory <i>Heaven in a Wild Flower: An Exploration of Nick Drake</i>, then again in 1994 with an unneeded
    (but not necessarily unwelcome) best-of collection, <i>Way to Blue: An Introduction to Nick Drake</i>.</p><p>
    
    Ten years later, a third-wave of posthumous Drake paraphernalia has arrived: In June, Island Records issued <i>Made to Love Magic</i>,
    a piecemeal assemblage of unreleased material, and now the label brings us <i>A Treasury</i>, a revamped greatest hits compilation.
    Island is hoping recent high-profile discoveries of the man's music will move units the way his songcraft has long moved souls, but
    the whole act seems a bit redundant.</p><p>
    
    Drake's albums not only stand up well enough alone to render all the honorary drivel moot, they're as tight and succinct as any
    compilation could hope to be.  And with only three records to his credit, neophytes don't exactly face a long and spotty recorded
    history to sift through for the goods.  But-- let's be real-- who didn't see this coming: the ceremonial unveiling of a lost tomb
    of heretofore unheard tracks, followed by a sorely unneeded mix of career highlights.</p><p>
    
    The problem is that Drake's legacy is already well-worn ground.  By this point, there are likely very few remaining newcomers who
    weren't already trounced by the deluges of 1986 and 1994 or wooed by the bard's Volkswagen spot.  Of course, with an artist as fecund
    as Drake, the argument over which of his songs are ""definitive"" and warrant best-of inclusion is endless.  No one is ever going to
    produce an introductory compilation as well-formed, as enigmatic, or as emotionally charged as any of Drake's studio efforts.  Which
    is why <i>A Treasury</i>'s failure is great, but understandable.</p><p>
    
    Unlike most acts of exploitation, this one is reasonably benign.  Nearly every song on <i>A Treasury</i> is a show-stopper, and the
    track selection is fine, spotlighting Drake's weighty insights and limning the various complexions of his character.  After ""Introduction"",
    the album really gets going with ""Hazey Jane II"", which is perhaps Drake's most upbeat-sounding song, though it's actually a claustrophobic
    damning of city life.  ""What will happen,"" Drake asks, over the baffling strain of gilt cool-jazz horns, ""when in the morning, when
    the world, it gets so crowded that you can't look out your window in the morning?""  The song is from <i>Bryter Layter</i>, Drake's
    second album, which coincided with the country lad's timorous arrival in London, and the buoyant orchestration is oddly foreboding of
    the subsequent rift between Drake, the city, and producer Joe Boyd.</p><p>
    
    The poignancy of the opening track is only outshone by ""River Man"", perhaps the dearest 5/4 love ballad ever crafted and the song most
    directly responsible for critics' and biographers' eager use of the words ""sweeping"" and ""orchestral"" in describing Drake's sound.
    Like ""River Man"", ""Cello Song"" is lifted from <i>Five Leaves Left</i>, and slyly incorporates the baroque instrumentation that marked
    that album without squelching Drake's lissome guitar playing and his velvety hummed inflections.  On ""Hazey Jane I"", Drake's relationship
    with the bevy of studio musicians who accompanied him on <i>Bryter Layter</i> hits its excessive apex, but once again Drake shines:
    Amid a Morricone-esque swirl of overwrought strings and booming, tympanic drumming, Drake delivers one of his most distinctive guitar
    parts, a wily, galloping line that evokes the American West better than, well, most American artists. But first-timers would be better
    off hearing these songs in the context of their respective albums, where-- in close proximation to music written in similar moods--
    they take on a different and richer hue.</p><p>
    
    Much is made of Drake's notorious depression, and rightly so. His emotional undulations certainly colored his work, and are keenly
    felt in songs like ""Way to Blue"" and ""Northern Sky"". But singer/songwriters-- few of whom offer any contest for Drake-- often make
    their living in the doldrums, and to conflate Drake's studiously honed skills with the putative inspiration of his personal struggles
    is melodramatic. The supernal emotion of Drake's songs is more a product of a fertile mind (Drake studied English at Fitzwilliams
    College in Cambridge) and a phenomenally inventive and versatile guitar style than a tortured soul.</p><p>
    
    That said, Drake fandom is an emotional investment, and thus far more subjective than one's typical grazing interest in less magnetic,
    less substantive, less tragic artistic personalities. Nick Cave is great, but he's still alive and still churning out albums, reconfiguring
    his legacy with every new catalogue entry. Drake never had the opportunity to sully (or bolster) his quaint, near-perfect canon. Many
    would argue that's a good thing, but instead the job falls to anthology-mongering record labels, whose interest in preserving the
    artist's legacy is secondary. However huge and malfeasant the failings of this collection, the depth of persona and enormity of
    talent still shines through, and it's going to take a heck of a lot worse than this to undercut Drake's memory.</p></div>"|2446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2446-a-treasury/|3.3|Sam Ubl

As fortune would have it, however, the psych-folk landscape that Hall of Fame helped germinate is now at full bloom; <i>Paradise Now</i> is one more prize to this year's already bountiful harvest.</p><p> 
    
    Though it's doubtful that music this communal and vaporous can have a true focal point, the trio's sound is generally organized around the talents of singer-instrumentalist Samara Lubelski, who formerly played violin with artsy Rodan spin-off The Sonora Pine. Lubelski also moonlights as an engineer at the renowned Rare Book Room recording studio (where she assisted on such Pitchfork-friendly albums as Ted Leo's <i>Hearts of Oak</i> and The Fiery Furnaces' <i>Blueberry Boat</i>) and on <i>Paradise Now</i> it sounds as though Hall of Fame had ample studio time to fully marinate and slow-cook their songs to a smoke-ringed maturity.</p><p>
    
    As with fellow Siltbreeze alumni Charalambides and Tower Recordings (whose seminal 2001 release <i>Folk Scene</i> also featured contributions from Lubelski), Hall of Fame use some of the traditional instruments and methods of folk-rock as a gateway to a monumental, highly personalized cosmic drift that swiftly eludes any earthbound categorization. <i>Paradise Now</i> is more song-oriented than the trio's previous work, and in places Lubelski's languorous vocals recall some of Georgia Hubley's most engaging lullabies with Yo La Tengo. But even at their most accessible, these songs possess such unstable molecular structures that every sound is permitted to gradually and elegantly dissipate into the ether in the same manner a campfire slowly consumes a handful of pine needles.</p><p>
    
    Tracks like ""Endless Returns"" or ""Hall of Fire""-- with their gauzy guitar arpeggios and whispered, indistinct vocals-- may at first fool you into branding <i>Paradise Now</i> ""lo-fi"", but a couple of attentive listens should prove that passages initially mistaken for bottomless murk actually teem with carefully sculpted layers of light and movement. Thin shafts of violin and other plucked strings dodge and weave through the gentle, persistent hum of vintage amplifiers, while the percussion completely abandons forward propulsion and instead settles on slo-mo cymbal crashes and distant conversation. Even the placidly strummed acoustics of ""Arrow By Day"" eventually begin to disintegrate pixel-by-pixel, until the tune is carried off on the backs of dragonflies and replaced by the hazy ecstasy of ""My Sweet Miasma"" which sounds like The Jesus and Mary Chain on holiday in the Hundred Acre Wood.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album, Hall of Fame maintain such a uniform level of mood and texture that naysayers might think that the band has merely rewritten the same song 10 different times. But those who prefer to do their astral navigating uninterrupted by any superfluous intrusions from reality will surely consider Hall of Fame's consistency to be a virtue, and they could soon find immersion into the calming and restorative waters of <i>Paradise Now</i> to be their recreation of choice.</p></div>"|3997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3997-paradise-now/|8.4|Matthew Murphy

    They really don't. Over the tumbling drums and righteously acidic riffing of ""Into the Smoke and Smoke"", Spencer Moody reminds us, ""You're gravely mistaken if you think for a second that Smoke and Smoke give a fuck-fuck-fuck"". Even when that's not being overtly rammed home, disdain and apathy incessantly seep out of the strident, repetitive chords and tar-stained screeds that sear across their debut album-- nine tracks wrapped up in only about twice that many minutes. Misanthropy's not just Smoke and Smoke's guiding principle-- it's their very medium; their hookless lo-fi brutality seems built from the stuff. <em>Love Suffers Long</em> is a sustained musical middle finger that, behind a stone-faced aspect, is chuckling ironically about the banality of the gesture and wondering who would be na\x95ve enough to think it mattered.</p><p>
    With this kind of automatic cred, I guess you can get away with it. Follow the tendrils of smoke as they furl: Smoke and Smoke is comprised of Spencer Moody, Mike Kunka, and Dan Haugh. Kunka and Haugh played together in godheadSilo (Kunka was also in Enemymine), and Smoke and Smoke's musical style could be described as a much more streamlined version of those bands' grinding, repetitive proto-punk. It's perhaps a wounded version of it, which would be apt, considering that godheadSilo went kaput when Haugh injured the tendons in his left arm, and Dead Low Tide, the band Kunka played in with singer Spencer Moody (told you it was going to get twisted), fizzled when Kunka was sick for more than year with whooping cough (dude-- whooping cough? What's next, rickets?).</p><p>
    Moody is best known as the singer for Murder City Devils, but here he gruffly rants more than sings, even less melodically than his MCD style. His repertoire of Fauvist koans, bad jokes, skewed aphorisms, and lyrical anticlimaxes evoke his pal and tourmate Tim Harrington, another fuming art-punk trapped in the body of a beard-folker. (Visually, Moody's a dead-ringer for Harrington-- beard, paunch, and all.) Within the echo chamber of stabbing guitars that is ""Strike Lightning Strike"", he offers: ""The forest was already on fire when the lightning struck,"" and on the chaotic, staccato throb of opening track ""How Did the Cook Get His Finger Stuck in the Dishwasher?"", Moody checks in with a winking groaner of a punch line: ""I don't know, but they both got fired."" The collision of Moody's snarled soliloquies with his bandmates' strangely inert, slogging foundations often evokes another professional cynic, Steve Albini, singing about ""real squirrels"" on <em>1,000 Hurts</em>, particularly on absurdist dirges like ""Bathrobe Jacket"", with its curious refrain, ""Bathrobe jacket, ascot towel"". On ""Throw the Lever"", with its drunken wobble and seesawing melody, they come across like a no-wave Hold Steady.</p><p>
    The tacit message seems to be that trying is for suckers, and caring about anything, passe. In one illuminating example, the band's online blog states: ""Our full-length, <em>Love Suffers Long</em> (I think that's what it's called), will be released this coming Tuesday."" It's not exactly a new pose for rock music, but worth mentioning for the fact that Smoke and Smoke have managed to boil furious indifference down to its most basic essence. The album's live-recording style only bolsters the effect: You don't feel as if the music really wants to be listened to, and at the end of each song, it's not hard to imagine that you've wandered into Smoke and Smoke's practice space and they've abruptly stopped playing to gaze at you with mild irritation, appalled by the incredible imposition.</p></div>"|7787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7787-love-suffers-long/|7.5|Brian Howe

What happened to Bristol's most famous cultural export, a sound that teased listeners with impressions of Major-era urban Britain as a <i>Blade Runner</i> fantasy? In the days when Tricky, Massive Attack, and Portishead were heralded as the town's mavericks, the music seemed to be a fine cosmopolitan blues for the early 90s recession. Hip-hop beats that wander the streets every night to find God, basslines that hiss from soundsystems bloodied from a decade of tear, and Hollywood's spectacle of ""noir""-- all mourned utopian visions discarded by pragmatism and fashion sense. Cynics framed the genre's death certificate, dated September 29, 1998 when UNKLE's <i>Psyence Friction</i> was released to tin ears and demoralized souls. But in an age when hip-hop productions can sound dry-cleaned, some elements of trip-hop are still missed.</p><p>
<i>Retrospective</i>, a greatest-hits, b-sides, and rarities collection from Smith &amp; Mighty, could further mystify the genre. Producers Rob Smith and Ray Mighty helped import hip-hop into the city during the early 80s with their Three Stripes Sound System, which mixed soul, dub, and funk that helped catalyze the ""Bristol Sound."" Later that decade, they won a cult hit by giving that treatment to Burt Bacharach's ""Walk On By"" and Massive Attack's first single, ""Any Love"" (1988). S&amp;M; didn't release their own album until 1995's <i>Bass Is Maternal</i>, and later garnered sleeper success on !K7's <i>DJ Kicks</i> series.</p><p>
    
    So what do Smith &amp; Mighty's <i>Retrospective</i> tracks now mean to you and your family? Well it depends on how you adjust your stereo. If the volume is muffled to dentist office-level and the bass is removed, then you'll get some snazzy'n'chic beats and diva operas for your next visit to JCPenney's. But if your subwoofers are cranked loud enough to strike a dozen neighborhood watch alerts, then Smith &amp; Mighty uncannily translate British R&amp;B; and soul to the cardboard-matted dancefloor. For instance, the opener, ""Come On Back""-- sung by feted chanteuse Carlton-- could either be a dub-lite AOR tune or a bass-bruised, Trenchtown soliloquy. The dependence on drum machines and synths unfortunately date and trap most of the music in the late 80s.</p><p>
    
    The highlights inculde the S&amp;M-produced; 1989 UK hit by Funk 4, ""Wishing On a Star"", with its sample of James Brown's timeless ""Funky Drummer"". Other high points include the dub-jungle space out, ""Move You Run (Blue &amp; Red Mix)"", and dancehall toaster Niji's boasting of his speakerbox to a drum'n'bass strut in ""B Line Fine Blow"". But nothing on <i>Retrospective</i> is as radical or abstract enough as albums by fellow Bristolians like, say, Massive Attack's <i>Blue Lines</i> or Portishead's <i>Dummy</i>. The mysteries are absent-- it's up to historians and nostalgists to create new ones.</p></div>"|7786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7786-retrospective/|6.4|Cameron Macdonald

After 25 years of critical reappraisal and at least 15 years of indie and post-rock bands flaunting their influence, has Can finally gotten their just desserts? I don't think so. Not just yet. Can still seem just a little bit ahead of the curve. They really were ""post-rock,"" as opposed to just futuristic. Can's music anticipated both the musical trend toward decontextualization via electronics, post-production, and editing, and the cultural trend toward collective experience and shared information. Other bands shone as brightly in this regard (The Beatles, for one), but Can arrived as a more finished product and more capable of translating their ideas onto record than any other. And they jammed: Any randomly picked moment from ""Yoo Doo Right"" or ""Halleluwah"" is as powerful now as when it was released. You can use them as make-out music, a drug soundtrack, or just stuff to listen to while driving. You can use them to blast off or come down.</p><p>
    
    Can formed in 1968, featuring two former students of avant-garde classical composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, a former free-jazz drummer interested in math, a rock'n'roll guitarist 10 years younger than the others, and an American sculptor living in Europe in order to evade the draft. Keyboardist Irmin Schmidt had visited America in 1966, hooking up with the Fluxus musicians (Terry Riley, La Monte Young, et al.) and becoming inspired to form a rock band. He and bassist Holger Czukay (who would issue 1969's <i>Canaxis</i>, which used primitive sampling technology) were keen to incorporate experimental composition and compositional theories into a rock setting, and when Czukay's student Michael Karoli turned them onto Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles, the band's fate was sealed.</p><p>
    
    However, Can would not become just another band. For one, they eschewed the idea of a frontman or long solos. Each member of the group served a specific function, but the band operated as a collective; no individual part was more important than the whole. They recorded music in a manner befitting a modern electronic artist, editing together tracks using source material culled from marathon improv sessions. This is also similar to what Miles Davis was doing at the time on <i>In A Silent Way</i> and <i>Bitches Brew</i>, though while the trumpeter was jumping into uncharted territory for a jazz musician, Can had already memorized their instruction manuals and covered more artistic and technical ground faster than any band had ever done.</p><p>
    
    But then, Can's music transcends those kinds of props: They made music that felt at turns desolate, euphoric, tense, and blissful. They were the best possible result of intellect and inspiration in rock, and these four remastered CDs argue they are as ""important"" as any band you could name. Their sound is very much improved. For one, there is no hiss (!) and the EQ is much better than the previously available CD versions (Can liked bass). They also come with liner notes by <i>The Wire</i>'s David Stubbs; although his essays don't contain a lot new info, they'll be of interest to anyone who hasn't read much about Can.</p><p>
<i>Monster Movie</i> was released in 1969, and is Can's most rock-oriented album by a considerable margin. Its songs are raw and aggressive-- very much informed by The Velvet Underground's larval trance-rock-- and they mark Malcolm Mooney as nothing if not an inspired amateur. ""Father Cannot Yell"" leaps out of the gate with a hi-speed keyboard flutter and the snap of Jaki Liebezeit's snare. Although the band would later perfect a kind of ambient funk, here they were brawny (though precise), determined rockers to the hilt; five minutes into ""Father Cannot Yell"", the song climaxes with a blaze of bass, drums, and fuzzed-out guitar, and an entire legacy of minimalist rock (from Neu! to Comets On Fire) is predicted. Of course, the 20-minute ""Yoo Doo Right"" is the centerpiece, and gives the best indication of what Can would do afterward. The murky, primal atmosphere of drums that dominates the track never allows the listener to escape the band's propulsion; like much of Can's best music, ""Yoo Doo Right"" seduces me into hypnosis, and winds through a seemingly endless array of textures and variations. <i>Monster Movie</i> is an amazing debut, but would be Mooney's last. He suffered a nervous breakdown onstage and returned to America.</p><p>
    
    Before beginning work on their second album, Can released the compilation <i>Soundtracks</i>, containing music they'd done for films. <i>Soundtracks</i> was released mainly to capitalize on the success of the band's debut in their native Germany, and is often overlooked by listeners expecting only throwaways and outtakes. In truth, most (but not all) of the songs don't extend the same artistic reach as those on either <i>Monster Movie</i> or the subsequent records, but they're hardly throwaways. In particular, ""Mother Sky"" has an intensity matching anything on the debut, and new vocalist Damo Suzuki's presence lends the tight-lipped drone a sedated, half-gone feel that only advances its tranced-out cause. ""Tango Whiskeyman"" and ""Don't Turn the Light On, Leave Me Alone"" are short, beat-dominated variations on Can's version of pop, while ""She Brings the Rain"" (featuring Mooney) cuts out the drums entirely in favor of jazzy torch balladry. Can would later compile a more satisfying collection of non-LP material (1974's <i>Limited Edition</i>, expanded to <i>Unlimited Edition</i> two years later), but <i>Soundtracks</i> is a good sampling of their more straightforward experiments.</p><p>
    
    1971's <i>Tago Mago</i> saw Can stretching out into the beyond, and it was their first full-length studio record to feature Suzuki. Originally released as a double-LP, <i>Tago Mago</i> confirmed what ""Yoo Doo Right"" had only suggested: Can knew trance-rock as if they'd invented it. However, unlike it did on <i>Monster Movie</i>, the band didn't necessarily lull you into hypnosis via bass and beats. ""Aumgn"" and ""Peking O"" are the most experimental tracks in the Can catalog, sharing more in common with the irreverent electronic music of Stockhausen or Pierre Henry than most anything related to rock-- <i>Ummagumma</i> was a possible exception. Their often-bizarre arrays of sound effects and reverb-drenched, murky guitar sprawl have driven more than one listener to put down the pipe. Of course, when the epic ""Halleluwah"" starts with Liebezeit's industrial strength funk pattern before winding through dark, echo-chamber ambience and minimalist drone (while never letting you forget those drums), the detours seem a lot less harrowing. The shorter songs, like the gray, faintly ominous ""Paperhouse"" or the flawless funk and dark impressionism on ""Mushroom"", are merely smaller pieces of the band's most exotic pie.</p><p>
    
    The following year's <i>Ege Bamyasi</i> drops the haze and hits with a sharp pang from the get-go. Often described as the ""tense"" Can album, <i>Ege Bamyasi</i> is actually the band at its most focused, bolstered in part by the surprisingly good performance of the single ""Spoon"". The proto synth-pop (or synth-rock) song was used as the theme to a popular German television show, and made enough money for the band that they could afford a better recording environment and a chance to do justice to their ideas. ""Pinch"" is reminiscent of concurrent Miles Davis; a tough, dissonant take on rock, always kept sparse enough as to be unsettling. Likewise, ""One More Night"" was dry and efficient in the extreme, though, musically having more in common with Steve Reich than Davis. ""Sing Swan Song"" was Can's best ballad, while ""Vitamin C"" is still the best funk ever to come out of Europe. The band would refine their sound even more in coming years, but they wouldn't really ever get better than this.</p></div>"|11698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11698-monster-moviesoundtrackstago-magoege-bamyasi/|8.7|Dominique Leone

Other bands shone as brightly in this regard (The Beatles, for one), but Can arrived as a more finished product and more capable of translating their ideas onto record than any other. And they jammed: Any randomly picked moment from ""Yoo Doo Right"" or ""Halleluwah"" is as powerful now as when it was released. You can use them as make-out music, a drug soundtrack, or just stuff to listen to while driving. You can use them to blast off or come down.</p><p>
    
    Can formed in 1968, featuring two former students of avant-garde classical composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, a former free-jazz drummer interested in math, a rock'n'roll guitarist 10 years younger than the others, and an American sculptor living in Europe in order to evade the draft. Keyboardist Irmin Schmidt had visited America in 1966, hooking up with the Fluxus musicians (Terry Riley, La Monte Young, et al.) and becoming inspired to form a rock band. He and bassist Holger Czukay (who would issue 1969's <i>Canaxis</i>, which used primitive sampling technology) were keen to incorporate experimental composition and compositional theories into a rock setting, and when Czukay's student Michael Karoli turned them onto Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles, the band's fate was sealed.</p><p>
    
    However, Can would not become just another band. For one, they eschewed the idea of a frontman or long solos. Each member of the group served a specific function, but the band operated as a collective; no individual part was more important than the whole. They recorded music in a manner befitting a modern electronic artist, editing together tracks using source material culled from marathon improv sessions. This is also similar to what Miles Davis was doing at the time on <i>In A Silent Way</i> and <i>Bitches Brew</i>, though while the trumpeter was jumping into uncharted territory for a jazz musician, Can had already memorized their instruction manuals and covered more artistic and technical ground faster than any band had ever done.</p><p>
    
    But then, Can's music transcends those kinds of props: They made music that felt at turns desolate, euphoric, tense, and blissful. They were the best possible result of intellect and inspiration in rock, and these four remastered CDs argue they are as ""important"" as any band you could name. Their sound is very much improved. For one, there is no hiss (!) and the EQ is much better than the previously available CD versions (Can liked bass). They also come with liner notes by <i>The Wire</i>'s David Stubbs; although his essays don't contain a lot new info, they'll be of interest to anyone who hasn't read much about Can.</p><p>
<i>Monster Movie</i> was released in 1969, and is Can's most rock-oriented album by a considerable margin. Its songs are raw and aggressive-- very much informed by The Velvet Underground's larval trance-rock-- and they mark Malcolm Mooney as nothing if not an inspired amateur. ""Father Cannot Yell"" leaps out of the gate with a hi-speed keyboard flutter and the snap of Jaki Liebezeit's snare. Although the band would later perfect a kind of ambient funk, here they were brawny (though precise), determined rockers to the hilt; five minutes into ""Father Cannot Yell"", the song climaxes with a blaze of bass, drums, and fuzzed-out guitar, and an entire legacy of minimalist rock (from Neu! to Comets On Fire) is predicted. Of course, the 20-minute ""Yoo Doo Right"" is the centerpiece, and gives the best indication of what Can would do afterward. The murky, primal atmosphere of drums that dominates the track never allows the listener to escape the band's propulsion; like much of Can's best music, ""Yoo Doo Right"" seduces me into hypnosis, and winds through a seemingly endless array of textures and variations. <i>Monster Movie</i> is an amazing debut, but would be Mooney's last. He suffered a nervous breakdown onstage and returned to America.</p><p>
    
    Before beginning work on their second album, Can released the compilation <i>Soundtracks</i>, containing music they'd done for films. <i>Soundtracks</i> was released mainly to capitalize on the success of the band's debut in their native Germany, and is often overlooked by listeners expecting only throwaways and outtakes. In truth, most (but not all) of the songs don't extend the same artistic reach as those on either <i>Monster Movie</i> or the subsequent records, but they're hardly throwaways. In particular, ""Mother Sky"" has an intensity matching anything on the debut, and new vocalist Damo Suzuki's presence lends the tight-lipped drone a sedated, half-gone feel that only advances its tranced-out cause. ""Tango Whiskeyman"" and ""Don't Turn the Light On, Leave Me Alone"" are short, beat-dominated variations on Can's version of pop, while ""She Brings the Rain"" (featuring Mooney) cuts out the drums entirely in favor of jazzy torch balladry. Can would later compile a more satisfying collection of non-LP material (1974's <i>Limited Edition</i>, expanded to <i>Unlimited Edition</i> two years later), but <i>Soundtracks</i> is a good sampling of their more straightforward experiments.</p><p>
    
    1971's <i>Tago Mago</i> saw Can stretching out into the beyond, and it was their first full-length studio record to feature Suzuki. Originally released as a double-LP, <i>Tago Mago</i> confirmed what ""Yoo Doo Right"" had only suggested: Can knew trance-rock as if they'd invented it. However, unlike it did on <i>Monster Movie</i>, the band didn't necessarily lull you into hypnosis via bass and beats. ""Aumgn"" and ""Peking O"" are the most experimental tracks in the Can catalog, sharing more in common with the irreverent electronic music of Stockhausen or Pierre Henry than most anything related to rock-- <i>Ummagumma</i> was a possible exception. Their often-bizarre arrays of sound effects and reverb-drenched, murky guitar sprawl have driven more than one listener to put down the pipe. Of course, when the epic ""Halleluwah"" starts with Liebezeit's industrial strength funk pattern before winding through dark, echo-chamber ambience and minimalist drone (while never letting you forget those drums), the detours seem a lot less harrowing. The shorter songs, like the gray, faintly ominous ""Paperhouse"" or the flawless funk and dark impressionism on ""Mushroom"", are merely smaller pieces of the band's most exotic pie.</p><p>
    
    The following year's <i>Ege Bamyasi</i> drops the haze and hits with a sharp pang from the get-go. Often described as the ""tense"" Can album, <i>Ege Bamyasi</i> is actually the band at its most focused, bolstered in part by the surprisingly good performance of the single ""Spoon"". The proto synth-pop (or synth-rock) song was used as the theme to a popular German television show, and made enough money for the band that they could afford a better recording environment and a chance to do justice to their ideas. ""Pinch"" is reminiscent of concurrent Miles Davis; a tough, dissonant take on rock, always kept sparse enough as to be unsettling. Likewise, ""One More Night"" was dry and efficient in the extreme, though, musically having more in common with Steve Reich than Davis. ""Sing Swan Song"" was Can's best ballad, while ""Vitamin C"" is still the best funk ever to come out of Europe. The band would refine their sound even more in coming years, but they wouldn't really ever get better than this.</p></div>"|11698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11698-monster-moviesoundtrackstago-magoege-bamyasi/|9.8|Dominique Leone

The real litmus test-- as recent compilations by such veteran imprints as Merge and Matador have demonstrated-- is what happens to a label once it begins to undergo significant turnover; how it recovers and redefines itself when its top bands break up, defect to greener pastures, or otherwise descend into inactivity. Does the label shrivel and fade into memory, or does it have the taste, persistence, and clout necessary to reload its roster and maintain its relevance?</p><p>
    
    By this measure, the decade-old Chicago-based Kranky has to be considered a resounding success, as evidenced by this 21-track, two-disc sampler. Most of the faces here are relative label newcomers (only three of the 18 acts presented also appeared on Kranky's 1998 Europe-only compilation) but nevertheless this collection amply proves Kranky capable of sustaining its high level of quality while simultaneously performing the rare feat of preserving a coherent and immediately recognizable (if not easily definable) aesthetic.</p><p>
    
    In the latter half of the 90s, Kranky released seminal recordings by the likes of Labradford, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and Low. Records by artists such as Jessamine and Bowery Electric feel, in retrospect, like transitional works for the label, representative of those zany post-rock days when experimental-minded, rock-bred performers began segueing into the freer realms of improv, abstract electronica, dub, and minimalism. As <i>Kompilation</i> makes evident, this transition is now complete-- there's hardly a peep on either of these two discs that bears anything but the most indirect relation to rock. Despite widely divergent instrumentation and methods, all of the artists showcased here share certain genetic traits: an appreciation for empty space, talent for gradually unfurling melodies, and the infinite patience required to stalk transcendence.</p><p>
    
    On disc one Kranky immediately throws down the gauntlet, exhibiting such an imposing mountain of drone that it almost feels as if the listener has been presented with a dare. The set opens with ""Even If You're Never Awake"", a track from Stars of the Lid's forthcoming album, which seems appropriate considering that the duo has always produced what is perhaps the purest distillation of the Kranky sound. Voiceless soundwaves throb and swell glacially over the course of eight minutes, and as always Stars of the Lid marvelously capture the chilly shape-shifting of ice shelves slowly receding beneath the northern lights. Keith Fullerton Whitman keeps the drone flowing with his appropriately named new piece ""Stereo Music for Serge Modulator Synthesizer"" which sounds something like a set of bagpipes decaying in time lapse.</p><p>
    
    Other highlights of the first disc include an exclusive track from the always-captivating Pan American and an alternate mix of ""Campestral"" by electronic microtexturalist Greg Davis. The only significant misstep is Growing's ""Primitive Associations/Great Mass Above"" which skirts dangerously close to New Age territory with its field recordings of chirping birdies. Although all of the artists here are usually best appreciated in album-length doses, these pieces manage to complement one another unusually well in this more abbreviated context.</p><p>
    
    One of Kranky's biggest recent artistic coups was their recent alliance with Texan psych-folk juggernaut Charalambides. This collection features a pair of entrancing solo works by group members Christina and Tom Carter, and Kompilation's second disc kicks off with the title track from Charalambides' recent masterpiece <i>Joy Shapes</i>. The ecstatic nature of the group's improvisational vocals and guitar may seem out of keeping with some of the fussier, more distanced pieces neighboring them here; but their dazzling, ocean-wide sound and heavenward yearning correspond perfectly with Kranky's broader objectives.</p><p>
    
    More dynamic than the first disc (a couple of tracks even feature decadent luxuries such as percussion), the collection's second disc trips down memory lane, exploring Kranky's recent history. Previously released tracks like Jessica Bailiff's ""Swallowed"", Clear Horizon's ""For Days"", or Outhud's ""Dad, There's a Little Thing Called Too Much Information"" obviously aren't particularly new anymore, but still they all sound just dandy lined up so neatly together in a row. At record's end, Kranky thoughtfully drop us back off where we began with Stars of the Lid, going all the way back to 2001's ""Requiem for the Dying Mothers Part 2"" where we find them still placidly rolling the same boulder up the same hill.</p><p>
    
    Featuring nearly 150 minutes of music-- and carrying a retail price comparable to that of your average EP-- <i>Kompilation</i> has to qualify as one of 2004's best musical bargains. (In fact, if you want to factor value into the equation, go ahead and mentally bump the above rating up a couple of notches.) If you're an established Kranky hardliner, the new tracks and low cost pretty much make this a must-grab; and if you've always been intrigued by the label's output but been too shy to introduce yourself, this is as painless an initiation as you could hope for. It sure looks from here like everybody is a winner.</p></div>"|2055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2055-kompilation/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

That Jesse Poe's Tanakh project was started in Richmond, Va.-- my hometown-- won't mean much to most people, so outsiders will have to trust me when I say that elements of the city are captured on this self-titled double album.</p><p>
    
    During this time in Richmond, Poe lived with several musicians in a former Masonic Temple in Church Hill, one of the city's oldest neighborhoods. Tanakh's HQ was called the Pyramid Institute and they made noise with whatever happened to be lying around. For instance, a broken piano found on the street was disemboweled and the wires were bolted to the walls of the space and tuned. The bowed drone of those strings provide the tonal center for this record.</p><p>
    
    The first disc contains an almost hour-long piece that begins with a simple three-note motif before, one-by-one, various sounds slowly crawl from dark corners of the temple. Some are easy to identify (guitar, piano, short-wave radio, djembe) and many of them aren't (the various flavors of metallic rustling may or may not come from the mounted strings), but it all coalesces into a singular sound universe that implies industry, decay, anxiety, and, possibly, evil. The second disc is just under 30 minutes and features some of the same types of sounds but with added cello and more guitar, as Mick Turner-style moments of blurred lyricism mix with the groan and wheeze. Both tracks are effective slices of dark ambience.</p><p>
    
    This is a much different Tanakh than we've heard on their past two records, the second of which saw Poe moving increasingly toward a song-oriented direction. But here there's no voice and nothing approaching a tune-- just two long pieces of constantly shifting drone. It has something of a classic Alien 8 sound, as these two tracks fit easily next to some of Sam Shalabi's quieter improv releases. It's easy for such records to devolve into a messy thicket of meaningless noise, but the players in Tanakh are generous with space and have a strong sense of balance, allowing the listener's focus to shift gradually from one detailed and finely rendered element to the next.</p><p>
    
    One final bit of history: The church on this hill where the album was recorded is St. John's Episcopal, where Patrick Henry gave his ""Give me liberty or give me death"" speech in 1775. The church is still standing and the blocks surrounding it are filled with ancient brick homes in various states of repair, endless tangles of wrought iron, and dark, overgrown alleyways with broken cobblestone underfoot. Church Hill is, in short, one of the more shadowy and gothic places in America, and Tanakh is an excellent choice for its soundtrack.</p></div>"|7928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7928-tanakh/|7.6|Mark Richardson

(He actually teaches my kids at day care.) The former KMD black sheep's beats and rhymes overfloweth from his work on Madvillain to his innumerable cameos. But even the most ardent fans usually forget that Doom started his career as a designer for Wizard trading cards, home of the middle school pastime Magic: The Gathering. The names of tracks from the 2004 compendium <i>Special Herbs Vol. 3-8</i> were delivered as promo package to the Magic: Eleven Noon series. It is my privilege to recreate the play-by-play of a match from earlier this year in which Doom faced his card-slinging nemesis Cut Chemist in the Malibu Beatmakers Magic/Yu-Gi-Oh Throwdown.</p><p>
    
    MAGES BEGIN:</p><p>
    
    Currently, Doom and Chemist are tied at 16 life apiece. Doom taps four mana to enchant both his Vermillion Bandit and Ghost Prawn with the redolent Saffron. An audacious move. Saffron, the most expensive of all Greek spices, woos both Bandit and Prawn with sumptuous scratching and delicate wafting keys. The subtle vibes and upbeat tempo imbues both creatures with +1/+1 upgrade and a fistful of flavor. Chemist counters by dropping an extra Forest mana and introducing Seshiro the Annointed, a legendary 3/4 snake monk. Chemist has also released the feisty Zatar, queen of the Middle Eastern spices. Zatar's ghastly power lies in her mimicry, and she adopts the form of Patti LaBelle circa 1986 and smothers Ghost Prawn with her bosom. Prawn deceases. A single tear rolls from Doom's steel faceplate.</p><p>
    
    Sensing that his ass is exposed, Doom reluctantly taps more Island mana to release both Brass Secretary and the Greasemonger. To add to their collective fury, Doom endows them with carcinogenic Monosodium Glutatmate. Bathed in the Roland rhythms of my parents' 1985 class reunion dancefloor, Monosodium evokes the spirit of Los Angeles funk in all its gel-soaked patent leather glory and casts the spell of self-doubt over Chemist's beastly arsenal. Greasemonger redoubles, launches a stream of toejam, and deals four damage to Chemist's self-esteem.</p><p>
    
    To avoid a potential rout, Chemist pumps up the jam and kicks out a classic from the <i>Special Herbs Vol. 3 &amp; 4</i>-- as any good wizard would do. By introducing the campy Arabic Gum, Chemist momentarily distracts Doom's assault with the herb's BOOM network meanderings. The six-step breakbeat boogie combines with the suspicious brass of 50s cartoons and dazes Doom's creatures with its blatant sardonicism. Metal Fingers returns the gesture with the gritty Four Thieves Vinegar. In stark contrast to the herbs of <i>Volume 3 &amp; 4</i>'s childish facade, Vinegar poses a formidable threat, remorsely bludgeoning Seshiro with hypnotic guitar squeals until the snake monk succumbs to its repetitive fury.</p><p>
    
    The match momentarily stalls as Doom rolls a blunt laced with the lunar-landing Calamus Root and pours a pot of subtly hyperkinetic Agrimony to purify the blood and cure his acne (note the mask). Doom then pulls out all the stops, taps all of his mana, and releases the a slew of minons from his 2004 Pro Tour Nagoya set-- including Sundering Titan, Viridian Shaman, and Kiki Jiki the Mirror Breaker. He also unleashes the toporific brilliance of High John. This herb, a favorite of mojo bag aficionados and the sexually deviant, draws Chemist into its blanket of seductive saxes and lilting organics. Doom embraces victory as Kiki Jiki delivers a definitive 12+ damage. The victory herb Cedar spews from eyeholes in Doom's mask as dozens of disco balls filled with the ashes of The Meters fall from the ceiling. The two share a tearful embrace.</p><p>
    
    After an exhausting match, Doom mixes a pitcher of Country Time lemonade as Chemist cues a Tivo'd episode of Malchemy in the Middle.</p></div>"|5615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5615-special-herbs-vol-3-8/|7.5|Jamin Warren

The Vladislav Delay comparisons are not far off: McIlwain is as competent a free-former as he is a slick beatmaker, and as Lusine (and earlier as Lusine icl and L'usine), he's produced legitimate specimens of everything from Warp-inspired ambient techno to proper microhouse to lush loop manipulations. Few electronic artists manage such variety with uniformly good results. And by carrying themes and textures across his otherwise disparate tracks and/or sequencing his albums so their tracks self-compound, Lusine has shown that he's capable of producing an engaging and eclectic full-length. He just, well, hasn't done it yet.</p><p>
<i>Serial Hodgepodge</i> is not perfect, but its ambition is admirable. As the name of the album implies, Lusine has an unabashedly short attention span here. Gorgeous processed vocals on ""Ask You"" (think Markus Popp's So project) open the album with chilly pessimism, a current which carries throughout the album's impeccable first third. Glassy synth and displaced melodies on ""Slur"" pick up where the <i>Richard D. James Album</i> left off, while the short but soaked drone ""Drip"" plays off a distant piano flutter we heard on Tim Hecker's <i>Radio Amor</i>. In each of these tracks Lusine is remarkably frugal-- he often forgoes percussion accents when they can be understood in the rhythm of his samples, sometimes even distracting us from the beat with perfectly concurrent melodies. ""The Stop"" benefits the most from his spare approach. It's Akufen-style cut-up house but without actual cut-ups, those same processed vocals quickly squeezing out the scraps of earlier melodies before the drum loop degenerates into syncopated figures and squelch.</p><p>
    
    Lusine nails these first four tracks. The rest of <i>Serial Hodgepodge</i> is in permanent flux, however. The canned chill-out track ""Everything Under The Sun"" robs the album of nearly all its momentum. With warm wisps, bouncey-ball kicks, and enough pink noise to make for fine M-series microhouse, ""Figment"" comes close to restoring it, but Lusine curiously withholds the four-four downbeat, making for a suspenseful but ultimately excruciating listen. Ultimately, <i>Serial Hodgepodge</i> fails by the same token: Lusine has the talent to make good on his aspirations, but seems to refuse the extra effort that his sort of perfection demands.</p></div>"|4972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4972-serial-hodgepodge/|6.8|Nick Sylvester

    Hardly the polished, definitive statement that its title and cover photo imply, <em>Acoustic</em> culls demos and live tracks from 1998's <em>Anthology</em> box, plus seven previously unreleased recordings.  Much of the material draws from Lennon's most raw album, <em>John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</em>, recorded after primal scream therapy with Dr. Walter Janov.  The new disc's most visceral moments-- a bitter, desolate blues waltz of ""Working Class Hero"" and a finger-blistering, previously unreleased ""Cold Turkey"", on which Lennon's wavering, sheepish-lion vocal veers closely to Marc Bolan-- predict the spare sneer of punk, even without amplification.</p><p>
    
    By comparison, <em>Rock 'n' Roll</em> sounds like ""Crocodile Rock"".  Here, Lennon revisits his roots, complete with the heavy, 50s-style echo he was employing on much of his original work (""Instant Karma"", for example).  The now-familiar backstory to this satisfying (if less-than-brilliant) outing is that an out-of-court settlement with Morris Levy, owner of several Chuck Berry copyrights, required Lennon to record three songs to which Levy owned the rights.  (Levy had charged, quite rightly, that Lennon's ""Come Together"" cribbed from Berry's ""You Can't Catch Me"".)  Phil Spector produced four of the album's tracks, while Lennon handled the rest. Despite the legal obligation, Lennon's performance never sounds forced; instead, he sounds unfettered, barnstorming through the favorites of his youth with the gleeful abandon he must have felt when, while listening to Radio Luxembourg, he first heard ""Heartbreak Hotel"".</p><p>
    
    While <em>Rock 'n' Roll</em> is a wistful look at rock's lost innocence, <em>Acoustic</em> hunkers down in the humdrum here-and-now of 1970s existence. ""All right, so flower power didn't work,"" Lennon tells a live audience between the off-kilter protest songs ""The Luck of the Irish"" and ""John Sinclair"", both originally on <em>Anthology</em>. ""So what? We start again."" The fallout of the failed 60s left <em>Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas</em>'s Raoul Duke mired in drugs and depravity; Lennon ultimately turns, creatively enough, to ""reality,"" as described in the oft-quoted ""God"".  The version here, previously unreleased, opens with twangy guitar as Lennon goofs an impression of a Southern preacher.  The accidental distortion that kicks in on the bass during Lennon's powerful, repetitive ""I don't believe"" sequence vaguely brings to mind Neil Young's haunting <em>Dead Man</em> theme.  Interestingly, Lennon replaces ""I don't believe in Zimmerman"" with the less cryptic ""I don't believe in Dylan.""  As always, the song concludes with Lennon's statement of faith in himself.  Still, this is a drop in recording quality compared to the <em>Anthology</em> version.</p><p>
    
    Among other previously unreleased tracks, the nursery-rhyme melody of ""My Mummy's Dead"" stands out against a stark, slightly crackly background.  ""Dear Yoko"" (as opposed to ""Oh Yoko!"", which you may know from the <i>Rushmore</i> soundtrack if not from <i>Imagine</i>) suffers from fuzzy tape noise that Capitol's sound engineers couldn't remove.  The song's straightforward message of love still shines through-- ""I miss you like the sun don't shine""-- but casual listeners would be better served by the <em>Double Fantasy</em> version. ""Well Well Well"" becomes a heavily phased, forgettable one-minute run-through of the <em>Plastic Ono Band</em> original.  Pop gem ""Real Love"" is informative as a demo, though it will merely leave you heading back to The Beatles' 1996 version with fresh ears-- it's proof that Paul, George, and Ringo didn't fuck that one up, after all.  On the plus side, you don't know ""What You Got"", originally from <em>Walls and Bridges</em>, until you hear this percussive, bluesy rendition.</p><p>
    
    On ""Watching the Wheels"", Lennon fleshes out the solipsistic themes hinted at in ""God"". Whether or not his years of domesticity were as blissful as advertised, I don't really care. It's a song that Holden Caulfield might have sung after realizing he couldn't smear out every F-word, a song about being true to oneself.  If only <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>-obsessed maniac Mark David Chapman had understood, I like to think we might be listening to a new, blissfully mediocre release by a 65-year-old Lennon rather than a rarities compilation.  This recording-- originally released on <em>Anthology</em> and the ""Unplugged"" bootleg-- strips away the hopelessly dated production of the <em>Double Fantasy</em> version.  What's left is poetic, melodic, homespun-- it's what diehard fans of any band look for but rarely ever find in a demo.  Even brief background chatter from Yoko can't throw a Spaniard in these works-- instead it adds intimacy to the proceeding. It's my new favorite Lennon recording, at least until the next time I listen to <em>Imagine</em>.</p><p>
    
    Nothing on <em>Rock 'n' Roll</em> matches that moment, but it has a breathless energy all its own. The remixing and remastering is clearly noticeable-- for instance, the cover of Gene Vincent's ""Be-Bop-a-Lula"" sounds infinitely clearer and brighter here than on the original album. With its staccato acoustic guitar and Lennon's fervent vocals, ""Stand By Me"" remains more affecting (just barely) than the Ben E. King rendition. Much criticism has been hurled at the album's ubiquitous brass, but on the new recording, bouncy horns and newly vivid bass enliven even previously unspectacular songs like ""Ya Ya"", although the cod-reggae ""Do You Wanna Dance"" will forever be a concept by which Lennon fans measure their pain. ""You Can't Catch Me""-- the song that necessitated this album in the first place-- is a solid footstomper.</p><p>
    
    The four bonus tracks are welcome, but will leave little to satisfy Lennon cultists. ""Angel Baby"", a swooning ballad from the cringe-worthy posthumous release <i>Menlove Ave.</i>, should have been on <em>Rock 'n' Roll</em> in the first place. (It had appeared on Levy's unauthorized <em>Roots: John Lennon Sings the Great Rock &amp; Roll Hits</em> release.) Unfortunately, ""Be My Baby""-- one of the most legendary cuts from <em>Roots</em>-- is still absent; completists already own it on <em>Anthology</em>, but that's no excuse. ""To Know Her Is to Love Her"" is another slow, pleasantly schmaltzy <em>Menlove Ave.</em> track, while ""Since My Baby Left Me"" is a bouncy version of a cut from that comp. ""Just Because (Reprise)"" is really nothing more than a bizarre alternate ending. ""I'd like to say hi to Ringo, Paul, and George,"" John says, possibly drunk. ""How are you?"" This earnest, slightly silly snippet captures the record's tossed-off <i>joie de vivre</i>-- even if it's not as Rock 'n' Roll as, say, <em>Acoustic</em>.</p></div>"|4732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4732-acoustic-rock-n-roll/|7.1|Marc Hogan

<i>Poison &amp; Snakes</i> is Janes' second album, and it's pretty much everything you'd expect from a seasoned singer, songwriter, and performer who may very well refer to herself as a ""seasoned singer, songwriter, and performer"". Janes can sing pretty well, and she writes decent enough songs, but she knows both of these things, and <i>Poison &amp; Snakes</i> sounds a little too house proud.</p><p>
    
    Technically, the album's ""about"" the American West, and Janes' country doo-wop twang complements her more relaxed lovey-dovey numbers nicely enough, as on the let-you-down-easy lullaby ""Wonderkiller"", the potsy-panny, sometimes throaty ""Deep Sea Diver"", and the album's title track, for which Fifel Goes West And Plays The Album's Token Harmonica Solo.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, I don't know, it's all just too much. Janes goes for bonsai countrified punk on ""Streetlight"", but the whole thing comes out sounding like a Burger King commercial. ""Sets To Cleaning"" is unhinged and rickety, but not without the drummer's most transparent efforts to sound like he's completely autistic. The canned piano-and-kiddie-vox opener of ""Desert"" kicks up just enough post-rock dirt for the noodling to hit the seven-minute mark, but by the end the song still has nothing to say for itself. ""Go Between"" also sounds like a Burger King commercial, but in fairness, there are some scenes from <i>Dances With Wolves</i> it reminds me of as well.</p><p>
    
    I try not to get wrapped up in the folk authenticity or ""Who's faking the folk?"" debates about tradition, eclecticism, and so forth. Really, my biggest concern is whether an album makes me feel old, and this one definitely does. <i>Poison &amp; Snakes</i> is quality but adult-contemporary, a fine piece of Waterford crystal or Cat's Meow memorabilia that I can't yet appreciate-- if I'll ever want to.</p></div>"|4348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4348-poison-snakes/|6.0|Nick Sylvester

SGM's debut, 2001's <i>Grand Opening</i>, was equally indebted to post-Bungle labelmate Secret Chiefs Three and Meshuggah, piling on high-concept irony for some truly cracked prog-metal anthems. But SGM is one of the few bands in a multitude of self-consciously intricate metal acts that manages to retain a distinctive sound, counterbalancing their feigned desolation, difficult time signatures, and adept metal breakdowns with a penchant for melody and arty experimentation.</p><p>
<i>Of Natural History</i> finds the band shying away from overt irony, though not in their underlying concept; the band is apparently a group of Pagan scientists attempting to answer such lofty questions as ""Will the future involve wood?"" and ""What is a gymnosperm?"" In their music, however, SGM create a cohesive statement of virtuoso metal musicianship with the avant garde focus of an art-rock collective.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""A Hymn to the Morning Star"" begins with a foreboding Nick Cave-style narrative that reintroduces the band's self-promoted mythology (which itself varies from release to release)-- Frykdahl casts himself as a cult leader of sorts preaching the virtues of a stereotypical black metal god. The band uses a reserve of homemade instruments, an angelic backing chorus, and occasional music box-style glockenspiel to back up the track's theatrics.</p><p>
    
    Other tracks rely more heavily on the sound of Frykdhal and bassist Dan Rathburn's Idiot Flesh, whose disbanding in part led to SGM's formation. The pulsing momentum of a driving bassline in ""Bring Back the Apocalypse"" backs a maniacal chant chorus, and the jagged ""FC: the Freedom Club"" decries technological advancement (""The human race with technology is like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine"") while embracing a wave of crunching distortion offset by a detuned string section, marimba accompaniment, and field recordings of birds.</p><p>
    
    Female vocalist and Tin Hat Trio member Carla Kihlstedt's contributions add to the album's sprawling eclecticism. She acts as Frykdahl's graceful, angel-voiced foil and complements the band's foreboding atmospherics. The album's weakest moments lack the authoritative presence of a strong vocalist, but the band has for the most part curtailed their tendency toward indulgent instrumentals. The operatic ""Babydoctor"" remains compelling for the entirety of its 11-plus minute running time, slowly unfurling an epic demonic narrative over a slow-building, melancholic orchestral backdrop. It's this newfound sense of cohesion and focus that makes <i>Of Natural History</i> the most compelling of Sleepytime Gorilla Museum's collaborative works.</p></div>"|7785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7785-of-natural-history/|7.3|David Moore

Yet there is at least one guitar demigod who has languished in obscurity and poverty for over 20 years: Having helmed neither a formidable fan base nor a single well-selling album, Nels Cline is a quiet pioneer whose contributions to rock, jazz, and the avant-garde are deeply felt but who will likely never be credited with a signature-model Gibson.</p>
<p>Considering all the stylistic liberties Cline has taken-- cavorting from idiom to idiom and leaving his unique treads on all of them-- mainstream recognition was probably always wishful thinking. But heightened exposure is what Cline seemed to be after when earlier this year he posted a frustrated, almost apologetic letter on nelscline.com announcing he was joining Wilco. After a life of devout gigging, Cline was suddenly stressing the often blissfully ignored desire to do something lucrative and, in a somewhat defensive tone, attempted to preempt charges of perfidy from longtime followers of his jazz and fringe work.</p>
<p>The charges came, but they were marginalized, and the response to Cline's work on Wilco's <i>A Ghost Is Born</i> tour was overwhelmingly positive. Typically saddled with tossed-off AM radio mentions and the occasional Neil Young nod, Wilco were now drawing comparisons to Sonic Youth and Can and garnering effusive reviews for an increasingly exploratory live show.</p>
<p>While all of this might earn Cline some long overdue exposure, the man hasn't-- as many feared-- abandoned his roots, and on <i>The Giant Pin</i>, a new album with his backing group The Singers, he makes sure to touch all his bases. The album essentially consolidates all the patois in which Cline has made his mark, deriving a twisted Clinean Esperanto that's something of a mouthful.</p>
<p>""Blues, Too"" kicks things off in familiar fashion, riding a fractured blues riff atop nimble, slightly amorphous brush work. Quiet and deceptively simple, the song is a pleasant prelude to ""Fly, Fly"", on which a plugged-in Cline delivers all manners of curlicues and arabesques. For four minutes there are no surprises-- the first track has plenty of the same polymathic noodling and off-the-wall drumming that marked earlier Cline releases such as <i>Destroy All Nels Cline</i> and <i>Interstellar Space Revisited</i>. But then things begin to fog up in an orgy of fills, effects, and scratching before a drum machine boots the song into a new direction: chugging rock punctuated with sundry bits of feedback and squall. Of course, it's only a digression, and once the overtones have rung out, Cline punctuates the track with a crisp bluesy figure.</p>
<p>That unexpected detour isn't an anomoly, however. ""He Still Carries a Torch for Her"" reinforces the point, excising the jazz influences of the first two tracks as Cline hammers home a roiling psych-rock riff. In the hands of a flimsier player the song might have been a flop, but Cline finds a way to generate intrigue through an extended, effects-laden improv section, showing a side of his playing that would have fit amid the murky din of Wilco's ""Less Than You Think"". From there, ""Something About Devin H."" delves further into formless atmospherics, while ""The Ballad of Devin Hoff"" starts off sultry and slow before building to a roaring climax.</p>
<p>Cline has fused his jazz and rock interests before but <i>The Giant Pin</i> takes both poles to heretofore untouched extremes-- especially at the low-volume end of the spectrum. Stark stylistic and dynamic contrasts pervade the album, yet the transitions are smooth. The record is quieter and more restrained than other The Singers releases, making it a rewarding if slightly less exhilarating final product. Whether Cline will continue to cleave himself from the gigging life remains to be seen, but for now he's handling the balancing act quite nicely.</p></div>"|1511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1511-the-giant-pin/|7.0|Sam Ubl

    between Republican Presidential candidate George W. Bush and Democratic
    Candidate Al Gore:]</i></p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: Okay, gentlemen, you know the rules as established by the
    Commission of Presidential Debates. The questions will come from
    citizens in our audience. You have two minutes to answer each question;
    your opponent may then offer a rebuttal.  I will then ask a follow-up
    question at my discretion. The next four questions pertain to At the
    Drive In, a rock music group from Governor Bush's home state of Texas.
    The first, to Governor Bush, will be asked by Clara Thompson. Where are
    you, Ms. Thompson?  ...There you are.</p><p>
    
    Clara Thompson: Uh, yes, Mr. Bush.  Do you think that At the Drive In's
    new album, <i>Relationship of Command</i>, matches the intensity of the
    band's live show?</p><p>
    
    George W. Bush: Thank you, Ms. Thompson. As Governor of Texas, I'm proud
    of these young men from El Paso. I take both young people and the arts
    very seriously, as I think my record shows. But, uh, the question here,
    really, is: who do you trust, and who do you think will get things done?
    I am a uniter, and not a divider. Also, you can't hear At the Drive In's
    afros on record.</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: Mr. Vice President.</p><p>
    
    Al Gore: I'm glad you asked this question, Ms. Thompson, because this is
    an area in which Mr. Bush and I differ. While no album can ever approximate
    the complexity of the live concert experience, the sonic intensity of
    <i>Relationship of Command</i> makes it a good second choice. Andy Wallace
    mixed the album, and if that name doesn't ring a bell, let me remind you
    that nine years ago, he mixed an album called <i>Nevermind</i> by a band
    called Nirvana. The punch his mix brings to these guitars is impressive.
    So, while <i>Relationship of Command</i> doesn't quite compare to seeing
    this group live, you'll surely want to mosh-dance in your bedroom when
    you listen to this recording.</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: Moving on, this question comes from Mr. Frank Lee and is
    for Vice President Gore.</p><p>
    
    Frank Lee: If you are elected president, what do you propose to do about
    the inconsistencies of <i>Relationship of Command</i>?</p><p>
    
    Al Gore: Well, yes, I do think this album is largely inconsistent.  Right
    now, music is the most innovative it has ever been in the history of the
    universe.  We have many, many options open to us in these times.  Under
    the Clinton administration, we have brought music into a period of growth,
    of expansion, of limitlessness.  But I'll tell you this: if you want a
    country filled with records like <i>Relationship of Command</i> that are
    light on memorable riffs from bands steeped in punk and 70's classic rock,
    <i>[gestures to Bush]</i> this... is your man.</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: Governor?</p><p>
    
    George W. Bush: Creativity in music is up right now, yes.  But rock music
    for pure <i>rock</i> purposes has suffered under the Clinton administration.
    They're trying to muck up our loud, old fashioned noise with their Washington
    politics and fuzzy math-rock.  Now, these boys... the singing... either you
    love it or you hate it.  But the important part is, it gets by.  It gets by
    on a handful of truly catchy, anthemic rockers.  ""One Armed Scissor"" is the
    most arena-ready of the songs on <i>Relationship of Command</i>.  It has an
    infectious vocal hook.  It has a punchy riff on the chorus.  It gets into
    your subliminable mind, and it more than makes up for the quavering, affected
    vocalizing on the verses.</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: The next--</p><p>
    
    Al Gore:  Can I just say one thing about that?</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: No, I'm sorry, that's--</p><p>
    
    Al Gore:  Okay, alright.</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: The next question will be asked by Ms. Sandra Hartford, and is
    for you, Governor Bush.  Ms. Hartford, where are you?</p><p>
    
    Sandra Hartford: Mr. Bush, do you feel At the Drive In frontman Cedric
    Bixler's vocals are in need of reform?</p><p>
    
    George W. Bush: Well, I certainly won't claim to have... uh... invented
    them.  <i>[gasping laugh]</i></p><p>
<i>[polite laughter from audience]</i></p><p>
    
    George W. Bush: I, uh... no.  I think the man is very intense.  And
    intensity is a great thing.  If I am elected President, I can promise
    you, it will be very, very intense.</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: Vice President.</p><p>
    
    Al Gore: Ms. Hartford, I'm glad you asked this question because this is
    an area in which Mr. Bush and I differ.  Intensity <i>can be</i> a great
    thing, but is not always.  Cedric Bixler has two main vocal styles.  Now,
    one of those is a punk rock bark that recalls Rage Against the Machine's
    Zack de la Rocha.  The other is an operatic wail that resembles Ronnie
    James Dio.  The self-conscious aggression of the de la Rocha bit is
    tiresome, I find, but the Dio channeling is odd and occasionally fun.
    Take ""Sleepwalk Capsules,"" if you will, for example.  In the song's
    chorus, he's in full-on metal god mode.  You could even say his soaring
    pitch conjures the image of a youthful Tom Cruise sitting in the cockpit
    of an F-15 fighter.  But under Governor Bush's plan, it would not.  What
    he proposes is that we strip Tom Cruise naked, kill his family, burn his
    house and shoot down his fighter.  Now, I see a time when--</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: Mr. Gore, your time is up.  Governor, do you have a rebuttal?</p><p>
    
    George W. Bush:  Well, no.</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer:  Then, on to the next question.  This comes from Mr. Hannity
    Colmes and will be fielded by Vice President Gore.</p><p>
    
    Hannity Colmes: What song on <i>Relationship of Command</i> do you feel
    most encapsulates its strengths and weaknesses?</p><p>
    
    Al Gore: Definitely ""Invalid Litter Dept.""  The slower passages of this
    song are really not what the American people need at this time, with its
    80's metal guitar tone and know-it-all spoken word vocals.  And honestly,
    you'll find yourself wanting to hate it.  Tipper certainly hated it.  But
    the chorus of the song is such a fist-pumping, singalong triumph you'll
    find yourself returning to it again and again.  And that's really this
    album in a nutshell: alternately annoying and powerful.</p><p>
    
    Jim Lehrer: Governor Bush?</p><p>
    
    George W. Bush:  In the great state of Texas, we have a saying: people with
    afros should be shot.  <i>[gasping laugh]</i>  People need to have consequences
    for their afros, and that consequence is death.  During my term as Governor,
    I've fried hundreds of men, and it wasn't always easy.  You know, sometimes
    the switch jammed, or we'd get low on power or something.  But I know one
    thing: there cannot be a harsh enough penalty for bad hair.  Now, technically
    At the Drive In have not committed a crime, but what would you do if it was
    <i>your</i> hair?  What would you do if your four year-old daughter came home
    from school, crying, with all them products dripping down her cheeks?  I'm
    sure you'd want the maximum penalty implemented.  I know I would...</p></div>"|329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/329-relationship-of-command/|6.1|Mark Richard-San & Ryan Schreiber

Standing in tall grass in anonymous woodlands, Marshall plays an electric guitar-- presumably plugged into a portable amp kept carefully out of the frame-- and sings some of her own songs (""You Are Free"" and ""I Don't Blame You"", among others) as well as covers of tracks by Duke Ellington, Bob Dylan, Otis Redding, The Rolling Stones, and M. Ward. The boundaries between the songs blur, turning the performance into a medley-- a snippet of one track interrupts another as Marshall wanders the frame, accompanied only by crickets and cicadas and the wind through the leaves. The camera is largely stationary-- shooting extremely long shots-- and occasionally the exposure is altered, bleaching the picture. The sunlight is garish; the trees are stoic, moved only by the wind. The film, as low-key as Marshall's music, lasts nearly two hours.</p><p>
    
    It's a simple concept, but that doesn't mean it's not high concept.  Released on DVD and packaged alongside a 64-page booklet of Borthwick's photography and a one-song CD, the film's naturalism is exactingly calculated: Marshall sings extemporaneously, stopping to push her hair out of her face or swat flies buzzing around a mic clipped to her shirt, and the film wants to amplify these small interruptions as evidence of its improvisatory nature and signifiers of the notoriously shy singer's personality. But these actions are an effect more of the environment than of Marshall's performance style-- any performer in this setting would do the same. Furthermore, despite the high definition of DVD, the film's pronounced graininess does not allow for very much detail, which renders Marshall's face as little more than a blur, as if it has been digitally blotted.</p><p>
<i>Speaking for Trees</i> obscures Marshall even as it presents her literally at the center of the frame. On one hand, the compelling, often maddening sense of mystery surrounding Marshall remains intact. On the other, despite her haunting voice and more-than-capable guitar playing, neither she nor her music is the film's true subject; instead, it's Borthwick's ingenious concept that comes across most strongly. By trying to place Marshall's barebones music within an equally barebones setting, he has essentially turned the camera on himself.</p><p>
    
    The DVD includes three other short films, each of which is soundtracked by one of Marshall's songs and set on a beach that is as nondescript as the woods in ""Speaking for Trees"". ""Maybe Not"" features a mother and child walking through the surf; two girls, wet with saltwater, dance to ""Free""; and bleached-out shots of rocks and waves accompany ""Half of You"". These pieces are just as straightforward as <i>Speaking for Trees</i>, and Borthwick's minimal camerawork transforms them into live-action postcards. They're more intriguing than <i>Speaking for Trees</i>-- and not just because they're shorter or there is more activity in the frame, but because they're primarily visual rather than musical and/or documentary pieces.</p><p>
    
    The accompanying CD is as conceptual as <i>Speaking for Trees</i>' titular film: For one thing, it only has one song, whimsically titled ""Willie Deadwilder"". The track itself is more than 18 minutes of Marshall singing and M. Ward playing the same theme on acoustic guitar over and over. Just as the film foregoes all cinematic niceties, ""Willie Deadwilder"" eschews a pronounced song structure in favor of a short vocal melody that repeats throughout the song-- in other words, no verses, choruses, guitar solos, bridges, or breakdowns.</p><p>
    
    Such an undertaking is pure folly yet somehow Marshall makes it not just listenable but deeply intriguing. Featuring a performance that sounds just as off the cuff as the one in <i>Speaking for Trees</i>, the song begins with the title character and his lover Rebecca, an archetypal couple descended from Frankie and Johnny and John Prine's ""Donald and Lydia"", among too many others to list. But ""Willie Deadwilder"" is not the story-song this first section suggests, as Marshall breaks her narrator's distance and inserts herself into the proceedings: ""The first time I saw her,"" she sings in Willie's voice before switching to Rebecca's and finally dropping the two characters altogether. As the song continues, she namedrops St. Augustine and recalls hearing Dylan sing ""Ramona"" in the back of a cab. She then thanks friends and strangers for specific gifts: A girl who gave her a turquoise ring, a journalist who gave her a sweater, a man who gave her a song and flowers, another who gave her sanity.</p><p>
    
    Like ""I Don't Blame You"" and ""You Are Free"", ""Willie Deadwilder"" is music as a meditation on music, specifically on its capacity for self-expression, and its power to connect and communicate. It's a song about several songs, and this meta aspect never sounds forced or calculated-- instead, it seems artful and intuitive. Like Sonic Youth's ""Diamond Sea"", every aspect of the track-- its lyrics, length, sense of performance-- conveys this idea: ""This is...our song/ And it will go on and on/ A moment in time traveling on/ Even if it is too long, I don't care.""</p><p>
    
    Sold together in handsomely minimalist packaging, the film and song complement each other in surprising ways, but the set remains an oddity: One is too dull and the other too long to be of much use to any but the most obsessive fans-- but to those Cat Power aficionados, they form a strange, often fascinating curio.</p></div>"|1345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1345-speaking-for-trees/|6.1|Stephen M.

When the kids wandered off, we stepped up, thinking it might be fun to take a quick picture with the famously affable pineapple-dwelling milquetoast. He excitedly waved his hands, but as we moved toward him, a hulking teamster forcibly intervened, crossed his arms, and shook his head: ""We work for tips.""</p><p>
    I'll be the first to admit that I don't understand the SpongeBob phenomenon. In the early 90s, animators like John K, creator of ""Ren and Stimpy"", fled the toy commercial wasteland of network TV animation and found a niche on the fledgling Nickelodeon network, whose novel idea of airing creator-based cartoons led to the successful first wave of the network's original animated programming. But as these cartoons evolved, so did their marketing practices-- the congenial ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" came with a prepackaged saturation plan. The metaphorical sweaty bodyguard of Nickelodeon promotion forcefully exerts its presence these days-- and does so in stark contrast to the show's uber-amiable wholesomeness.  However: Is SpongeBob truly a model of forgiveness and understanding, or just an adorable, inoffensive tool in Nickelodeon's merchandising arsenal?</p><p>
    More importantly, how did Wilco, The Flaming Lips, The Shins, Ween, and Motörhead land on the soundtrack to the first ""SpongeBob"" film? Many of these artists have contributed to soundtracks in the past-- The Flaming Lips rode the success of ""She Don't Use Jelly"" all the way to <i>Batman Forever</i>, The Shins had a life-altering role in this year's <i>Garden State</i>, and Ween have appeared, along with Pantera (!), on a previous ""SpongeBob"" soundtrack-- but here, their original material is geared toward young children. Presumably the artists contributed to the soundtrack because they enjoy the show, or at least want to score points with their kids, but their contributions-- many of which were recorded specifically for the film-- sadly sound half-hearted.</p><p>
    Avril Lavigne's presence isn't a surprise (she's the only artist whose audience might overlap with show's), although her Gap-rock take on the ""SpongeBob"" theme is pretty excruciating-- all 46 seconds of it.  The Shins might be hoping to cast their net a few demographic points below the ""O.C."" crowd, but their contribution, ""They'll Soon Discover"", comes off as self-parody. The song's cloying hook-- a lilting acoustic guitar pattern and synth melody-- is forgivable, but James Mercer's specific references to the show's characters are awkward and frustrating.  His lyrics are too verbose to be deciphered by children, yet will also not likely sit well with older fans. Concessions to a younger audience are perhaps to be expected, but The Shins' uncomfortable middle ground here does no one any favors.</p><p>
    The Flaming Lips and Wilco both offer mediocre originals as well.  It's disappointing to hear the Lips' psychedelic inclinations reduced to a few grating synth lines, a weak Coyne melody, and an awkward backdrop of obtrusive bubble sound effects on ""SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy"".  Wilco's ""Just a Kid"", likewise, is a forgettable mod-ish number backed by Jeff Tweedy's eight year-old son, Spencer, and his band The Blisters.  Ween actually emerges as the Teflon contributor, in part by steering clear of the film's content altogether-- the previously released ""Ocean Man"" remains an enjoyable novelty.</p><p>
    Most songs are irredeemably annoying, though, even for a children's soundtrack. Prince Paul sleepwalks through the pandering hip-hop kiddie luau ""Bubble Party"", while Motörhead's ""You Better Swim"" is a bizarrely caricatured blooze number whose sheer inexplicability (Lemmy: ""C'mon, Spongey!"") at least makes the song interesting as a curio.  Songs written specifically for the film are the biggest offenders-- the endless repetition of ""The Goofy Goober Song"" in particular should make bus drivers countrywide batshit crazy.  Fans of this soundtrack's contributors couldn't be blamed for being compelled to pick this up for the new material, but unless you've kids of your own you want to impress, you might just want to skip the embarassment altogether.</p></div>"|7892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7892-the-spongebob-squarepants-movie/|3.9|David Moore

These memories are just the tip of the Viking's iceberg; the stuff has leaked into my adulthood, especially via first-generation Norwegian black metal, Mastodon, High On Fire, the Polish rockers who ran my borrowed van into a Los Angeles parking deck last spring, and-- mightiest of all-- the glorious slow-release sprawl of Isis.</p><p>
    An odd monster, the Boston quintet has toured with Ipecac rap artist Dälek; had their music tweaked on a series of 12-inches by (among others) label head Mike Patton, Godflesh's Justin Broadrick, Fennesz, Thomas Koner, and Khanate's James Plotkin; and have played both Mogwai's stage at 2004's All Tomorrow's Parties in East Sussex, England, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. They're not your mulletted uncle's bar band.  Their album <i>Oceanic</i> was all dark grandeur and waterlogged heaviness, and those qualities define the seven tracks on their follow up <i>Panopticon</i>. Even more epic and swirling than <i>Oceanic</i>, Isis's third full-length combines their velvety, slow avant-metal with Godspeed marathons and stately Ride-style shoegazing.</p><p>
<i>Panopticon</i> shares the crystalline production Matt Bayles (Mastodon, Pearl Jam) leant to <i>Oceanic</i>-- the drums and vocals are submerged, the riffs intricately monolithic-- but unlike on earlier efforts, the spare electronics are more seamlessly woven with the other instruments. A stronger record than its predecessor, <i>Panopticon</i> pummels but harnesses its sounds to a well-honed, diaphanous template.</p><p>
    In the grand spirit of over-the-top metal, Isis named the album after Michel Foucault's take on of Jeremy Bentham's concept of the panopticon; the tracks are thematically connected via Foucault's <i>Discipline &amp; Punish: The Birth of the Prison</i>. Because the lyrics are submerged in the mix they're fairly impenetrable, but Isis quote heavily from the French philosopher in the liner notes to make sure listeners don't think they chose the title at random: ""The Panopticon is a machine for disassociating the see/being seen dyad: in the peripheric ring, one is totally seen, without ever seeing; in the central tower, one sees everything without ever being seen."" (See also: The satellite spy cam photos decorating the album.) Considering the light/dark of the Patriot Act's ubiquitous surveillance, <i>Panopticon</i> feels more relevant than the science fiction of Queensryche's <i>Operation: Mindcrime</i>.</p><p>
    Isis's instrumentation also evokes a sense of creeping voyeurism. Astute track placement adds to the slowly building tidal, trance-like rush: individual pieces blend over and flood to the next. With a shadowy sense of repetition-- comparisons to Neurosis and the Melvins make sense-- the shortest track is 6:47 and the longest just under 10 minutes. ""Backlit"" starts with a delicate intro and stuck-in-the-well melodies before ultimately dam-breaking with gruff whirlpools; the distortion then ducks for cover, allowing a slow, clear bass line, percussion, and cascading arpeggios to bubble to the surface. Such complex dynamics overtake each new wave.</p><p>
    I remember in high school when a scruffy English teacher told me the word ""awesome"" should be saved for snow-capped mountain peaks not an AC/DC concert. I still don't agree with his Bob Ross-like language mangling-- both ""awesome"" and the equally 80s-rooted colloquilism ""triumphant"" are apt descriptions of <i>Panopticon</i>'s intricacies. Plus, not to rain on Sir Shakespeare's parade: I grew up in swampy, dank New Jersey and have always preferred the angularity of flat, burnt-out fields to the obviousness of your purple mountains majesty. But for fans of such old-school sublime, Isis connect these overstated zero-oxygen heights with sludgy, brackish small-town waters, creating stellar classical music for kids with bad teenage mustaches-- and those of us who empathize with them.</p></div>"|4136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4136-panopticon/|8.4|Brandon Stosuy

Which isn't to say that the Quebecois doesn't have the acumen or skill to present a seamless and engaging mix-- the record proves that he most certainly does-- Leclair just hadn't yet displayed that element of his talents. An accomplished producer, he is still best known for his debut LP <i>My Way</i> and his process of microsampling, taking small snippets of FM radio, white noise, and other sounds and pulling them together into a coherent whole.</p><p>
    
    Curiously, the spirit of Akufen's hallmark style permeates <i>Fabric 17</i>. As he does with the sonic detritus with which he normally works, Leclair employs only what he needs from the tracks he's selected, shaving off all but only 90 only seconds of some, allowing others to run nearly their full lengths, and doing some good ol' fashioned mixing when it suits him-- most notably on an opening section that blends Philippe Cam's ""LFO Drive"" and the Pantytec remix of Matthew Dear's ""Dog Days"". This inspired pairing kicks off a nearly perfect seven-track section of some of the choicest tracks in recent leftfield techno, highlighted by Pantytec's own ""Alabaster"" and The Rip Off Artist's ""Little Tiny Eight Inch Jack"".</p><p>
    
    Akufen favors tracks that mirror the best of his own productions-- abstract techno and tech-house that uses its more glitchy elements as elastic funk rather than simply as synapse-triggering pops and buzzes. The mix skips and bounds, twists and whirls rather than works itself into a propulsive groove; it also displays Leclair's sense of humor. Leclair crosses the line from sly wit into lampshade wearing when he slips on Senor Coconut's cover of ""Smoke on the Water"". That track doesn't entirely blend well; but what's more, because this Latin-tinged psuedocomedy classic rock cover follows on the heels of a few other more deft FM radio references (e.g. ""my Maserati does 185""), it feels almost as if Lecalir told a great joke but then soured the moment by still feeling the need to explain the punchline.</p><p>
    
    On the album's second half, Leclair reps his country with tracks from Jeff Milligan, Crackhaus, and one of that production group's member, Stephen Beuapre. When he reaches into his bag for one of his own records, it's the Mike Shannon Incision mix of ""Siamese Twins"", a track Leclair recorded as Horror Inc. A little less track-y and little more noirish, the mix's second half features some big guns (Herbert, Soul Center, Wighnomy Brothers, Luciano, Freaks), but it never matches the admittedly high bar set by those first seven tracks.</p><p>
    
    That isn't to say the record simply runs out of steam-- it remains playful and head-turning throughout, and it displays both Akufen's solid ear and his knack for discarding ideas before they drag past their point. Leclair's mix may not ebb and flow, but it doesn't aim to either. Instead, on his first mix Leclair seems restless and giddy, like a child excitedly moving between new toys without tiring of any of them. I guess that sometimes impatience is a virtue.</p></div>"|92.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/92-fabric-17/|8.2|Scott Plagenhoef

They emulate daily life beneath a bad photocopy of a sky. While listening to their music, you can get the sense that wonderful events are happening within shouting distance-- standing under Heaven's cracked concrete floor can do that to you.</p><p>
    
    Through a post-rock mess of guitar drones, homemade brass instruments, and drums that knock on every door in a hallway, Tarentel oddly emulates the climate of their San Francisco hometown. <i>We Move Through Weather</i>, they claim on their fifth album. Not quite. Their music is trapped by weather-- like a solar car attempting to move a foot during an Arctic winter. Their sound is usually caught between long, droning periods of stasis, and then slightly melts and slides forward when 74-degree melodies and rhythms set in. It's fitting that Tarentel begin and end this album with a film projector scraping whatever celluloid fantasies it replayed into mere plastic noise-- the human memory can be fragile like that. But if only they didn't title their otherwise mature excursions as trash-flick soundtracks.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Hello! We Move Through Weather!"", stumbles into the bitter spring air. The song's sample of a dust-carpeted projector snaps its finger to teach the beat to a roiling tom-tom rhythm, and mixes with a Wurlitzer organ and guitars that squeal like after-hours drunks on a freeway. This exhaustive delirium crescendos and then fades into an uneasy comedown with jangling guitar melodies and violin tones that float like dust in sunlight. ""Get Away From Me You Clouds of Doom"" (how Whitman-esque), is an improv-skree number that's a nastier, more engrossing revisit to ""Hello!""-- this time trudging through Babylon's streets with spring reverb'd guitar and long, high-pitched Wurlitzers chasing a thudding tom-tom rhythm. The 15-minute epic, ""A Cloud No Bigger Than a Man's Hand"", reverses the formula by opening with of murmuring woodwind and string drones. The music then locks into a tribal groove that opens a window to let artificially sweetened guitar melodies blow in and later dissolve into white noise.</p><p>
    
    Tarentel's amorphous but fragile sound is fallible to misfire. There is ""Bump Past, Cut Up Through Windows"", which tangos into a corner to an aimless Latin beat and redundant piano chords. ""We're the Only Ghosts Here"" follows a similar routine, but with longer-faced melancholy in its piano dirge, bass clarinet drones, and a filthier film projector clunking along.</p><p>
<i>We Move</i>'s best moment is too brief: ""Klankity-Klank"" is a brilliant minute-long ending-credits soundtrack; its percussion sounds like a stylus thunking on a warped vinyl groove while steam-powered, Faust-like guitar symphonics and digital pricks kick in. The imagination sees something different with each listen.</p></div>"|7943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7943-we-move-through-weather/|7.6|Cameron Macdonald

This works both ways-- when others expect little of you, it's easy to achieve an acceptable result because anything short of failure will be deemed success. Likewise, when you don't anticipate quality, you're more likely to be pleasantly surprised-- case in point: The Firebird Band's <i>City at Night</i>.</p><p>
    
    I had deflated expectations of The Firebird Band for a reason: They lowered their own bar with 2001's lousy <i>Drive</i> EP. (Their more rock-oriented debut album, <i>The Setting Sun &amp; Its Satellites</i>, was slightly better, but also disorganized.) The EP was such a cloudy mess that when the band didn't quickly follow it up, I figured it must have dropped off the face of the earth. Well, it turns out that the band-- a duo comprising ex-Braid guitarist Chris Broach and John Isberg-- had been holed up in studios and living rooms creating <i>City at Night</i>, which is a wholesale facelift and improvement. It's not a perfect record by any means--in fact I'd go so far as to say that nearly every song is too long, and a 74-minute running time gives it plenty of space to wear out its welcome-- but the basic material is strong and the new sound is seductive.</p><p>
    
    True to its title and cover art (on which I can see the building in which I work), <i>City at Night</i> is a slick, urban album that feeds off the energy of streetlights, neon signs, and cool, brisk air. It's hard to listen to half of these songs without picturing Mitsubishis speeding through downtown tunnels in silver-green monochrome, their cabins packed with well-proportioned young urban professionals going God knows where...maybe nowhere. Mechanical beats with live accompaniment do most of the heavy lifting as the band piles on synths, guitars, basses, keyboards, and vocals, occasionally hinting at punk but never quite detouring all the way. The seagull synths that announce opener ""Obsessive Compulsive"" set the album's midnight clubland mood. That song is one of the best here, a propulsive piece of post-disco that finds Broach in fine vocal form, somewhere between The Faint's Todd Baechle and The Fire Show's M. Resplendent.</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""Dangerous"", which features vocals by Elizabeth Black, and ""Los Angeles"" are decent examples of how the band stretches good ideas too far-- they each drag on because of grueling repetition. It's a shame, too, because ""Dangerous"" has a stellar chorus and great vocal turn by Black, while ""Los Angeles"" rides a sickly sweet Rhodes vamp (sadly, into the ground). Meanwhile, the heavily filtered, almost jungle-based pop of ""Can't Stop"" really needs to be a two-minute experiment and winds up going twice that distance with no real payoff.</p><p>
    
    The band only slips into a terrible idea once, and that's on ""Wake Up"", which opens as a fairly nasty post-punk explosion but takes an ill-advised dive into hip-hop that sounds forced and awkward; guests rappers JB and Urban Myth of Kerbloki don't fit the tone of the album. The Firebird Band also take less-than-successfull forays into eclecticism on the acoustic ballad ""Art"" and the Chiba City doom and gloom of ""Tokyo"", which uncomfortably rub up against one another. They're not bad songs, but they don't feel at home here either.</p><p>
    
    In the LP's liner notes, the band claims this album is the first in a three-part series. Presuming the band sticks to their new electro direction, one hopes they add concision to the equation because one of the things holding <i>City at Night</i> back is its longwindedness. The Firebird Band have come a long way in the last three years, but they still have a little bit of ground to cover before they're all the way there.</p></div>"|3064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3064-city-at-night/|6.8|Joe Tangari

It's a word that's been
    demonized and marginalized, especially amongst stodgy and often conservative U.S. rock critics.  Values, and the means in
    which they're defined, have been frequent talking points in the past couple of weeks, both in the rockcrit world (thanks to Kelefa
    Sanneh's recent <i>New York Times</i> Arts cover story on rockism) and in the nation at large (oh, you know).  In each case, the
    conservative factions have framed their dialogue in pretty knee-jerk terms.  Most rock critics' views of unity, it would seem, aren't
    dissimilar to George W.'s-- in the best Christian tradition, it's achieved through converting the heathens and savages.  Just as our
    family values are apparently now defined by bigotry, fear, and ignorance, so too is ""phony,"" ""plastic,"" ""inauthentic"" pop music.</p><p>
    Well, fuck all that: Just as (to borrow Biblical terms) ideas like love, hope, brotherhood, and charity should be central to American
    values, pop is music's culture of life.  It's a celebration of togetherness, the sound of universal pursuits and needs such as truth
    and beauty; of seeking a sense of self and, when desirable, giving yourself over to the crowd; of wanting to dance, smile, laugh, love,
    and be loved-- and it undiscriminatingly expresses it all to loads of people in a few short minutes.  <i>Before Sunset</i>'s Jesse may
    have been talking out of his ass when he said his next novel was going to take place within the span of a single pop song, but there's
    something lovely about the idea.  And anyway, maybe it's not so far-fetched to live a large portion of your life in a single song:
    Anne Lilia Berge-Strand has done it-- though not out of choice.</p><p>
    Ms. Berge-Strand (Annie to her friends and the record-buying public) believed that her debut record would have been released years ago,
    but fate intervened when her musical and romantic partner, Tore Korknes (Erot), died in 2001 from heart complications at the age of 23.
    The pair had only recorded one track, 1999's vaguely dubby electro-house love song ""The Greatest Hit"", an intoxicating clubland ""duet""
    between producer and vocalist.  The single-- along with Erot's solo work and that of fellow Nords Röyksopp-- helped launch Tellé Records
    and, thankfully, is included here alongside another dozen slices of stylish, sophisticated electro-pop, crisp tracks that move between
    the fizzy and the woozy, all anchored by Annie's breathy (sometimes almost muted) vocals.</p><p>
    Whether due to Annie's backstory or not, there's a palpable sense of melancholy permeating this album.  She's at her most confident
    while dispensing romantic advice to herself on the playful, wobbly Richard X collaboration ""Chewing Gum"", but on ""No Easy Love"", as
    she struggles to maintain hope in a search for love and grapples with the netless tightrope of commitment, Annie's voice barely rises
    above a whisper.</p><p>
    In addition to Erot and Richard X (who also co-wrote the winking, seductive ""Me Plus One""), <i>Anniemal</i> features a trio of tracks
    produced by Röyksopp's Torbjørn Brundtland, and a handful created with Op:l Bastards' Timo Kaukolampi.  This all-star team of Northern
    European electro-house producers infuses the record with often low, rumbling bass, twitchy synths, and an oddly high-altitude light-headedness--
    like floating, high on oxygen, just above a dancefloor.  ""Always Too Late"" lurches like a cross between Missy Elliott and UK garage and
    ""Come Together"" is pure acid house retro, but most of the sonics shade closely to each producer's already signature sounds.</p><p>
    For her part, Annie will likely draw comparisons to Kylie Minogue and Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell.  Such talk is most likely a
    slap at each artist's relatively thin vocals but, like the other two (especially Cracknell), Annie coaxes quite a bit from her
    cellophane pipes and transforms her weakness into strength.  Annie's vocals can't help but hide the senses of sorrow and vulnerability
    that run through her songs, and that makes her urge to get herself back up off the wall and reclaim her once-shattered life all
    the more touching.  And unlike Kylie, who exists in a celebrity neverworld, or Cracknell, who manages to make familiar settings seem
    like the most glamorous places in the world, Annie's tracks navigate the typical urban worlds of bars, cars, clubs, flats, and high
    streets.  She dreams of ""Top of the Pops"" and gives herself romantic advice in the mirror, yet her world should be pretty familiar
    to much of her audience-- sometimes achingly so.</p><p>
    It all peaks with ""Heartbeat"", one of the tracks Annie recorded with Brundtland.  Last month, Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester said he thought
    it was the best song of the year, and I agree.  On one listen, it doesn't sound like the best song of the year: It doesn't do the things
    that year-defining tracks are supposed to do-- break new sonic ground or spearhead a trend or paradigm shift.  No, what it does better
    than anything this year is what great pop often does: It articulates our most basic desires in an almost irresistibly catchy package.</p><p>
    The track itself narrates a party, drinks with friends, and the thrill of a first encounter-- all that many people want from a night
    out.  It communicates a love for music, friendship, and connection, and celebrates the moments when all three merge perfectly.
    The track's rhythm is obviously supposed to mirror the song's title, and that could have been cloying or heavy-handed, but when that
    rhythm quickens and doubles its pace as Annie catches the eye of and moves to the beat with another partygoer, it becomes a deceptively
    simple and surprisingly beautiful articulation of basic human need, beautifully encapsulating every element of human excitement-- guilt,
    nerves, excitement, hope.  The culture of life.</p></div>"|456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/456-anniemal/|8.8|Scott Plagenhoef

On the surface, this film adaptation of the popular novel of the same name appears to be a predictable entry in a continually unsurprising genre. But there are some notable differences between this and an infamous piece of bilge like <i>The Program</i>-- including the music, which was composed by Explosions in the Sky.</p><p>
    
    Explosions in the Sky have always made music of cinematic proportions, so it's fitting that they've found their way to the big screen. The bombast of their instrumental compositions is theatrical in it evocation of outsized landscapes and emotions, casting a colorful but somewhat phony sheen over their stellar playing. But even given EITS's penchant for excess, few could have seen this coming: a mainstream film soundtrack from an underground band whose fanbase is comprised mainly of scenesters with an aversion to contact sports.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, the distortion and dynamism of Explosions in the Sky's erstwhile output has been excised in favor of a gentler approach, one that spotlights the band's skill for nimble interlocking guitar harmonies. On <i>The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place</i>, the band took a less dire bent, emphasizing quieter, more optimistic instrumentals where its M.O. had previously been simply to ""fucking destroy."" Still, that album was a caterwauling racket compared to <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, which features predominantly hushed dynamics and only scant drumming.</p><p>
    
    All this makes for a rather soporific listen. Of course, soundtracks are designed to reach a synergistic effect with the movies they accompany, so to judge <i>Friday Night Lights</i> on its own is to slight it somewhat. Still, this album's movements are too genteel and calculated to achieve any real stand-alone emotional impact. Furthermore, Explosions in the Sky are guilty of the same paint-by-numbers sentiment triggering than the filmmakers themselves employ-- the band suffused its songs with flaccid MIDI string swells and other overwrought flourishes.</p><p>
    
    There are some worthwhile moments: ""To West Texas"" hails Odessa and other barren locales, and featuring a scrappy, ghost-town melody over Chris Hrasky's trademark heartbeat bass-drum pulse. ""From West Texas"", on the other hand, exalts the Panthers players' faint hope of one day leaving Odessa, providing one of the album's only upbeat tracks. Elsewhere, however, twinkling guitar melodies and dolorous tempos blur into one another and merely sound like tepid background music.</p><p>
    
    Curiously, the album carries a bleary pre-dawn aura, a tone that was consciously (and thankfully) chosen to avoid the kind of hard-swinging, soft-landing new-metal fisticuffs that accompany many cinematic depictions of athletic drama. At times it seems as if Explosions in the Sky might not be scoring the right movie, although their acquiescence comes is a nice change of pace from the typical Hollywood rock-based score. Had the band delivered the bluster of its previous work, this could have been a more compelling project; as it stands, it's merely an awkward curiousity.</p></div>"|2880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2880-friday-night-lights-ost/|5.5|Sam Ubl

It's a fair tantrum, but one listen to Mellow's <i>Perfect Colors</i> and you'll understand the need to view the band through the hyperkinetic acid-scapes of their forebears-- a lysergic costume parade fronted by the Walrus, Taxman, and lonely Ms. Rigby.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately for Patrick Woodcock and rest of the neo-psych Frenchmen in Mellow, they're quite adept at hero worship. It wasn't always this way: Their 2001 LP <i>Another Mellow Spring</i> was a still-born genre exercise with a handful of carbon copys. ""Another Mellow Winter"", for example, quoted ""Baby You're a Rich Man"" with enough larceny to bring charges. On their follow-up, <i>Perfect Colors</i>, Mellow escape the trap of making merely referential music thanks to grand electronic sweeps and plenty of psych-parody. The opening title track swoons with <i>Meddle</i>-era acoustic guitar and nachtmusik atmospherics. They admit the absurdity in their retro-adoration, but their senses of irony, humor, and excess make grand rehashings of should-be tired sounds.</p><p>
    
    On the rest of the album, Mellow continue to reform the golden era of psychedelia with post-modern production flourishes that are smooth and cantankerous in all the right places. They twist the leftfield post-millenial world as dreamt by 20th century sci-fi into cartoonish snapshots that acknowledge their contortions. Here, Woodcock insists, lies the future I fully realize will never be.</p><p>
    
    ""It Was Raining"" is the grotesque Wurlitzer-spiked folk song David Gilmour couldn't convince Roger Waters to put on <i>Atom Heart Mother</i>. As that gloomy organ sets the pace for psychotic background mumblings and a classic-rock drum roll, Woodcock jokes ""Don't know her name/ So I won't take the blame"" with space-cadet drollery. Somewhere, fellow Frenchmen Nicolas Godin &amp; Jean-Benoit Dunckel are checking their back catalogue for missing material.</p><p>
    
    ""In the Meantime"" retreats into a Gainsbourgian ramble, with enough grumbling guitar strokes and amorphous atmospherics to fill its empty spaces. Woodcock's lyricism is an acerbic drift that tackles scientology, drug addiction, and hippie vagrancy. A symphony to misanthropy, its wry understatings centerpiece an album that laughs at its own nostalgia and invites you to do the same.</p><p>
    
    In the end, how much you enjoy <i>Perfect Colors</i> will depend on how much emphasis you place on ingenuity or how much reverence you have for the past. The glamorous thrash of ""Out of Reach"", for example, will be a little too Warhol-schlock for many, but where else can you hear a grand orchestral intro dissolve into a demonic Orff-worthy chorus (""Drifting Out of Sight/ A Place for Meditation"")?</p></div>"|5212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5212-perfect-colors/|8.1|Derek Miller

The man who wrote Patsy Cline's ""Crazy"" was an outlaw before alt-country was a glimmer in its papa's eye. He made one of country's first concept albums (<i>The Red-Headed Stranger</i>) and was doing standards albums three decades before Rod Stewart and George Michael. He was doing them well, too-- <i>Stardust</i> remains not just one of country music's best covers albums, but one of its best period.</p><p>
    
    But relatively recent Willie Nelson LPs like <i>Spirit</i>, <i>Teatro</i>, and <i>The Rainbow Connection</i> hold their own against his most famous work. In addition, Nelson has been touring constantly-- whether by himself or recently with Bob Dylan-- he's guest-starred on ""Monk"", and he's the only person who can share a stage with both Toby Keith and The Dixie Chicks. Through a steady stream of collaborations, live albums, and assorted covers, Nelson has expanded his influence and fan base across genres and generations.</p><p>
    
    His gazillionth album, <i>It Always Will Be</i>, resembles late-70s/early-80s Nelson albums like <i>Always on My Mind</i> both in its impressively diverse mix of originals and covers and in its easygoing sound. Nelson's plainspoken cover of Waits and Brennan's ""Picture in a Frame"" reveals how so few words can convey a sentiment so big that it reduces even Willie to a low moan of ""oh yeah."" Toby Keith manages to give Nelson a genuinely affecting story-song in ""Tired"", which almost sounds like a liberal condemnation of big-business government. Nelson's gentle delivery communicates that song's tremendous beat-down fatigue through knowing understatement.</p><p>
    
    Both Norah Jones and Lucinda Williams attune their voices to Nelson's signature singing style, creating an evocative late-night vibe on ""Dreams Come True"" and amplifying the simmering heartbreak on ""Overtime"", respectively. But this dynamic is missing on the duet ""Be That as It May"", written and sung by Willie's daughter Paula Nelson. The song is a wonderful piece of country pop that proves she inherited her father's songwriting genes, but she sings in a painfully melismatic style, which-- combined with her country twang-- makes for a distractingly overworked performance.</p><p>
    
    Nelson really hasn't changed his musical style or his creative approach since his first albums in the 1960s and 70s, but songs from every stage of his career still hold up remarkably well. Not only has he aged incredibly gracefully-- his voice has lost nothing-- but he wears his wrinkles like medals, knowing his increasing age just adds more gravity to <i>It Always Will Be</i>, especially the three songs he wrote and sings himself. ""Texas"" is a slow, simple mariachi blues that showcases Nelson's own distinctive picking, and ""My Broken Heart Belongs to You"" recalls the sober, somber lost-love songs of <i>Spirit</i>. ""It Always Will Be"" is an affecting pledge of devotion, a song so sturdy that it gives the album's title a new meaning: It sounds just as timely and timeless as anything he's done.</p></div>"|5905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5905-it-always-will-be/|7.8|Stephen Deusner

    Led by veteran composer and clarinetist Peter Vermeersch, Flat Earth Society are well-versed in a broad array of big band jazz vocabularies, and their music is an unruly confluence of Carl Stalling's ""Merrie Melodies"", Henry Mancini's cosmopolitan swank, and Sun Ra's cosmic slop-- all performed with the whiplash attention span of John Zorn's Naked City. The group's previous four albums have only been available in the U.S. at import prices; so on <i>Isms</i>, Patton has thoughtfully compiled 19 introductory tracks-- including a couple previously unreleased ones-- to help bring you up to speed with FES's brand of lunacy.</p><p>
    Due to the band's rambunctious nature each FES album displays multiple personalities, but Isms compounds this schizophrenia by drawing material from such distinctive records as 2002's <i>Minoes</i>, the soundtrack to a children's movie, and 2003's <i>The Armstrong Mutations</i>, on which the group re-interprets the works of Louis Armstrong. As a result this collection undergoes such violent mood shifts from track to track that you'll either be enthralled by FES's seemingly bottomless creativity or else you'll feel like you just spent an afternoon on the Tilt-A-Whirl after a heavy lunch of ketchup and mustard.</p><p>
    Like many European jazz acts, Vermeersch and FES draw as much inspiration from such 20th century composers as Stravinsky or Bartok (not to mention art-rockers like Zappa or Beefheart) as they do from the blues or other more traditional American sources. These artier influences are especially evident on some of the shorter orchestrated pieces from the <i>Minoes</i> soundtrack like the Morricone-esque ""Minoes Op Boodschap"" or the mischievously atmospheric strings of ""Ellement En De Katten"". But they also surface on longer songs like ""Zonk"" or ""Trap"", which emphasize complex, turbulent arrangements and strenuous group interplay over solos or individual virtuosity.</p><p>
    The group's size and membership fluctuate (There may be as many as 20 players on some tracks) but regulars like bassist Kristof Roseeuw, trumpeter Bart Maris, and tuba player Leonaar De Graeve consistently deliver memorable performances. Best of all might be the two tracks here from The Armstrong Mutations, the percussive-heavy ""(Little) King Ink"" and the woozy Preservation Hall stomp of ""Funeral and Binche"", both of which strike the ideal balance between reverence and radicalism while Vermeersch plays his horn as sweetly as Sidney Bechet. Hopefully fleeting interludes of near-perfection like these are enough to sustain you while you chase Flat Earth Society around hairpin turns on their\xCAunending quest to capture the next hot moment.</p></div>"|3328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3328-isms/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

It's unclear what Case had done to warrant the ""still""-- perhaps a gaffe earlier in the show-- but amid the between-song chaos this declaration goes unanswered if not completely unnoticed. It's difficult to believe that Case isn't used to such public pronouncements of affection and devotion by now; you could tape any of her live shows and probably hear someone scream something similar.</p><p>
    
    Case is beloved-- and for good reason. Her voice is a forceful instrument that sounds modeled on an array of songstresses from Patsy Cline to Aretha Franklin to Linda Lyndell to Kate Pierson. It seems to convey a distinct personality-- lonely and pained yet strong-willed and defiant. And despite the purposefully rough sound of <i>The Tigers Have Spoken</i>-- only one acoustic guitar line was overdubbed-- her voice sounds clear and confident, as sturdily engaged with the music as she seems to be with individual members of the audience.</p><p>
    
    The Virginia native has also garnered an affectionate fan base through her easy mastery and lax definitions of many styles. As a result, Case's songs sound steeped in history but never beholden to it. A former drummer in various Vancouver punk bands, she caught the tail end of the alt-country movement with her solo debut, <i>The Virginian</i>, and snagged more listeners with her follow-up, <i>Furnace Room Lullaby</i>. But it was Case's third album, <i>Blacklisted</i>, that revealed the scope of her talents: On that LP she moved from vintage torch-and-twang and otherworldly blues to sweet soul music and plain old rock'n'roll. Not only did she manage to tie everything together into a cohesive whole without sounding distracted or hesitant, she ultimately turned that collection of admittedly lackluster songs into a calling card by making these genre jumps seem natural and largely invisible.</p><p>
<i>The Tigers Have Spoken</i> crams all those sounds and more into a mere 35 minutes. Instead of regurgitating a set list of already available tracks, the album-- which was recorded at shows in Toronto and Chicago-- includes new originals, covers, live staples, and rarities. Case's frequent backing band, members of The Sadies, nimbly follow her from song to song and style to style. They cover Loretta Lynn's ""Rated X"" with almost note-for-note faithfulness, yet manage to generate a go-go groove that is equally indebted to Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazelwood. Similarly, on ""Train From Kansas City"", Case and The Sadies speed up the tempo of The Shangri-La's original, retaining the skipping snare drum but playing up the bittersweet inevitability of the train that carries the boy whose heart she must break.</p><p>
    
    Case's own songs shine  as brightly as the covers. ""If You Knew"", which opens the set, is a desperate plea for a lover to abandon his vapid other woman, and it could be directed at a certain popular hotel heiress: ""She spends her daddy's money/ And she drives her daddy's car/ But what's crazy is the way you think that's style."" The short title track constructs a devastating metaphor about the end of relationships around the inability to reintroduce zoo-kept tigers into their natural habitat, but Case feels no need to overexplain: She lets the tigers speak for themselves.</p><p>
    
    Even better is ""Favorite""-- its low, lost, lonesome sound recalls the title track from <i>Furnace Room Lullaby</i>. Originally on a 2000 Bloodshot Records sampler, ""Favorite"" sounds fuller and more desperate in this live setting as the beautifully grim imagery of the final verse (""Last night I dreamt that I hit a dear with my car/ Blood from its heart spilled out onto my dress and was warm"") gives way to the spiraling banjo coda.</p><p>
    
    Case is a singer first and a songwriter second, and <i>The Tigers Have Spoken</i> is afflicted with the same malady as <i>Blacklisted</i>: Many of its songs are too short, clocking in under two minutes. ""Blacklisted"", for example, cuts off before the two-minute mark-- shorter than the studio version-- without fully exploring the implications of its title, and her cover of the Nervous Eaters' ""Loretta"" cuts off just as soon as it gets going. It's no surprise that the best songs here-- ""Hex"", ""Train from Kansas City"", and ""Favorite""-- all exceed three minutes: They sound roomier and more lived-in.</p><p>
<i>The Tigers Have Spoken</i> ends with two public-domain songs. The show-closing chorale ""This Little Light of Mine"" barrels along like a freight train, and ""Wayfaring Stranger""-- the only track here not recorded during a club performance-- makes a dynamic encore. This version comes from Case's appearance at the ideaCity Conference in Toronto; accompanied only by banjo and acoustic guitar, she leads the conference attendees in a sing-a-long on the chorus. The sheer crowd of voices subtly undercuts the song's lonely rootlessness as Case invites everyone at the Isabel Bader Theatre home with her. Maybe that generosity is the reason so many people seem to love Neko Case: She loves them right back.</p></div>"|1324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1324-the-tigers-have-spoken/|7.6|Stephen Deusner

R. Kelly's brilliant ""Ignition (Remix)"" was self-aware, witty, eminently danceable, and unerringly fun-- in short, everything the original ""Ignition"" was not.  Kelly proved to John Barth-lovin' meta-geeks what pop and dance fans already knew: that remixes can, in fact, be <i>more</i> accessible and successful than the original singles and album cuts.</p><p>
    
    Kelly broke the mold; with <em>Remixes 81-04</em>, Depeche Mode take credit for setting it.  Yes, there's finally someone to blame for ""Beetlebum (Moby's Minimal House Mix)"" and Bush's <em>Deconstructed</em>!  ""The remix story of Depeche Mode can be viewed as a history of the remix,"" Paul Morley crows in the liner notes, perhaps forgetting the whole of Jamaican music.  But as this sprawling three-disc set attests, DM's relationship with the remix-- from the 12-inches of the band's putative Vince Clarke years to a new collaboration with one of the Cro-Magnons in Linkin Park-- is both long-term and encompasses everything from electro-dub to extended dance remixes to hip-hop to house.</p><p>
    
    It stands to reason, then, that this compilation is frustratingly scattershot.  Collectors may salivate over Adrian Sherwood's white noise-laden mix of ""Master and Servant"" (previously available only on a rare 1984 vinyl release), but casual fans-- who, incidentally, would otherwise be well advised to stay the fuck away-- might enjoy Air's typically chilled-out ""Home"" or the first five minutes of DM's own 1987 re-working of ""Never Let Me Down Again"".  On the other hand, anyone with ears should avoid Danny Tenaglia's 12-minute ""I Feel Loved"", with its heavy-handed beats and endless echoey repetitions of the title lyric.</p><p>
    
    In some cases, this record reminds us how technologically far remixes have come from the days of simply splicing and extending a song's break or adding a heavier foot to its bass (see: Daniel Miller's fine but rudimentary 1981 ""Just Can't Get Enough"" remix). Other extended 12-inches don't fair as well: ""Get the Balance Right"" is stretched like a Navigator with unremarkable instrumentals, and uber-producer Flood piles the worst elements of sophistipop balladry onto ""A Question of Lust"".</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, at least a few of the remixes add some interesting twists, mirroring the shift over the past two decades toward artists using a remix to transform an original recording rather than just tweak it. DJ Shadow augments the emotional entreaty of ""Painkiller"" with classic soul samples and driving bass. Dave Clarke's ""Dream On"" builds upon gentle acoustic guitar arpeggios and fake strings with nary a hint of the original. A mix of ""In Your Room"" by Johnny Dollar and Portishead scratches and smolders like vintage mid-1990s trip-hop (it was released in 1994, after all).</p><p>
    
    Not all of the more transformative remixes succeed, however. Although DJ Muggs' ""Freelove"" mix is ultimately flawed, its hard-edged, guitar-based approach offers a promising premise for future remixers-- why <em>not</em> dress DM's synth-pop in the costumes of other genres until you find the right fit? Then there's the car crash at the end of the tunnel, Underworld's misguided ""Barrel of a Gun"" remix. I forget all my mid-90s micro-genre names, but there must be one for nine brain-dead minutes of window-rattling 180bpm drum loops.</p><p>
    
    A limited-edition third disc boasts the set's only new material. As with everything else here, it's a mixed bag: Rex the Dog provides a solid electro-house update of early single ""Photographic"", Dave Gahan's lovely performance on ""Halo"" is gussied up by Allison Goldfrapp's accompanying vocals, and Ulrich Schnauss's ""Little 15"" is eerily sparse.
    
    The massive record concludes with ""Enjoy the Silence"" as ""reinterpreted"" by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda. Appearing on the band's 1990 masterwork <em>Violator</em>, the original single was an elegant, expressive take on an old theme, one familiar even to Gloria Estefan: ""Words Get in the Way"". But I'd take Miami Sound Machine over Shinoda's thuggish faux-rebellious thrash and his penchant for using Pro Tools-perfect guitar distortion that's as frigid as your ex-girlfriend. ""Words are meaningless and regrettable,"" Gahan sings, and so is this remix-- in all of its antiseptic glory.</p></div>"|2284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2284-remixes-81-04/|5.9|Marc Hogan

The view across the tracks is a power transformer station and the back of a garden supply store. Occasionally, a rabbit munches the scrub brush. The best thing about the station is the bells. As a train approaches from either direction, two bells on stumpy posts in between the tracks begin to toll in a steady rhythm. But that's not the good part. The thing I love is that it's not always the same rhythm, and as they ring, they drift out of synch and make a kind of phase music that Steve Reich would love. Over the course of about 30 seconds the bells go from chiming in unison to ringing directly against each other. By the time they're back in synch, a third bell has joined, this one on the bottom of the train, creating a polyrhythm. This is where I experience accidental music every day, but you can hear it almost anywhere.</p><p>
    
    Music critics tend to make a big deal about complex rhythmic interplay, but I think it's a more naturalistic tendency than we usually give it credit for. Think about your breathing, your heart rate, and the speed at which you walk and chances are you've discovered a completely unconscious polyrhythm that your body creates out of basic necessity. That said, I am, of course, going to make a big deal about the skill with which Pattern Is Movement execute their multi-layered, polyrhythmic songs. This is one of those cases where a band couldn't have chosen a more self-evocative name if they tried, and PIF draws most of their momentum from the careful integration of many repeating figures, building complex latticework on which they hang swooping melodies in a manner not dissimilar to <i>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</i>-era Stereolab, 80s King Crimson, or The Sea &amp; Cake.</p><p>
    
    The album kicks off with Andrew Thiboldeaux's thick falsetto hovering over a burbling river of woven guitar and bass, and it begins with so suddenly that it sounds like you've landed in the middle of a song. Thiboldeaux drops into his normal range for the verses and the band gradually adjusts, ultimately spinning the song into a suite-like structure complete with a dramatic bass melody from Wade Hampton and a spine-tingling interlude. With all of its interlocking parts and strange meters, this could easily be labeled math-rock. But Pattern Is Movement aren't content with complexity for its own sake, veering into direct, emotional passages and never failing to use their polyrhythmic prowess in the service of melody. Thiboldeaux's liberal application of Mellotron and Rhodes piano contributes greatly to this dynamic, and he often backs his theatrical, swerving vocal melodies with simple keyboard countermelodies.</p><p>
    
    Pattern Is Movement also have tangible narrative and political aims. Their most aggressive moment, the stuttering, staccato heartstopper ""Julius"", offers lines clearly based on the current political climate: The truth is all mine/ They are so confused/ It's them that can't see,"" and backs it up with a shimmering coda that emphasizes the missing beats in its odd meter, climbing a melodic latter with a bright flute Mellotron. The juxtaposition of languid melody and hyperkinetic rhythmic patterns is extremely poignant on ""Pika Doun"", as the band drapes aching strings and swaying vocals over Corey Duncan and Daniel McClain's telepathically joined guitars and drummer Christopher Ward-- who also recorded the album-- sits out the first part of the track, allowing short swells in tape hiss and intermittent clicks to do his work.</p><p>
    
    As the Mellotron lament ""Postlude"" draws to a weary close, it conveys the sense of a completed journey. <i>The (im)possibility of Longing</i> finishes as an incredibly well-rounded, internally consistent record-- one that covers an awful lot of ground in just 26 minutes. Pattern Is Movement more than transcend the math-rock tag, and their senses of songcraft and pop accessibility greatly outpace those of just about any of their peers.</p></div>"|6557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6557-the-impossibility-of-longing/|8.3|Joe Tangari

Rice's typical media coverage-- layouts of him as a goth-noisenik redeemer prowling the alleyways-- suggests the former. Even without his image, Rice still makes music that can follow you home and lurk in a shadow outside your bedroom window.</p>
<p>Case in point is <i>Terra Incognita</i>, a compilation of almost 30 years worth of Rice's ambient pieces and loop experiments-- his ""mellow"" moments. What follows are meditations within claustrophobic settings, where all four walls around you stand nose-length within your mind. Repetition is often rendered as both forms of transcendence and fearful obedience to regulations. The music all demands close, patient listening.</p>
<p>The album opens with the eloquent ""Solitude"", a trance-out that loops and splits a Phil Spector-style piano-and-tambourine number. Rice separates the piece into two stereo channels then combines those for a ""moire"" effect, where phantom melodies and beats are heard. The song's three minutes pass by like a year in a day-- the music is hypnotic and addictive to the point where subliminal messages could be suspected. It's steeped in 60s Americana kitsch and yet a peculiar darkness lies within the ballardry, almost like slow dancing with Jayne Mansfield after her satanic baptism.</p>
<p>The kitsch isn't out of place here, considering that Rice respects Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey, who wore a cloth cap with horns like a trick-or-treater and even cut a few lounge piano records back in the day. The same sensibility drives ""Immolation of Man"", where a sample of a tacky, prairie-grown country guitar tune is unevenly looped into complete nuisance, along with an untitled track of an Old West player piano collapsing into an autistic fit. Not for the meek.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Terra</i> dwells on sensations that veer between mental and architectural collapse. ""Cruneta Voluptas"" steam-blasts a shimmering organ drone, while ""Father's Day"" loops a Z-grade horror flick flute and guitar duet into a soft din that might be play inside one's bleeding head. Rice knows that dread is best felt when it lurches from the bewildered mind to the heart, as ""Extract 4"" indicates with a dismembered music box melody that is gradually deep-fried by a metallic screech. Elsewhere, an awkward rhythmic attack on a guitar that erupts into vengeful feedback on ""Extract 12"". This approach doesn't always work: ""The Fountain of Fortune"" slogs around a Hollywood-cliche ""evil"" choir chant and a ho-hum sample of a fountain. So while <i>Terra</i> isn't shocking or subversive enough to live up to Rice's image as an art-terrorist, if you listen deep enough you'll sink to your neck.</p></div>"|5830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5830-terra-incognita-ambient-works-1975-present-featuring-boyd-rice/|7.2|Cameron Macdonald

A Tribe Called Quest had Q-Tip; The Lox had Jadakiss; The Pharcyde had Fatlip; P. Diddy's Da Band had Chopper. I don't think this happens because weak rappers align themselves with stronger ones or vice versa. Unlike members of rock bands, who each have a specific, unchallenged role to fulfill, each MC in a rap group has the same goals: to set the mic aflame, to move the crowd, and to do these things better than anyone else-- including members of their own group. As such, a level of competition enters the music, and in any competition, pecking orders are created. It's difficult to be the other guy-- what you lack in shine, you've got to make up with consistency and resolve.</p><p>
    
    But for contrast and balance, a good engine room is a vital component-- someone has to hold the base of the human pyramid steady while someone stands atop its apex. Wu-Tang Clan is the rare group forged from nothing but alpha-dogs but even among Shoalin's finest, one could argue that GZA and Masta Killa, with their cold, uninflected cadences and methodical lyrics, were the musical control group-- the steely, blank flatline by which the amplitudes of the other rappers' stylistic deviations might be gauged. But when the time comes for members of the group to record solo records and the second-tier MCs have to hold their own...well, it gets a little touch and go. You probably know Vordul Mega as the guy from Cannibal Ox who isn't Vast Aire. And while Vordul's <em>The Revolution of Yung Havoks</em> is a reasonably solid solo debut, it's probably not the record that's going to make you think of him any differently.</p><p>
    
    On the whole, there's nothing <em>wrong</em> with Vordul's album; it competently navigates the stoops, corners, and alleys of the post-Wu-Tang/Mobb Deep, majesty-in-miniature style of NYC hip-hop. But it does nothing to expand the map, staying well within those borders-- the weeded-out, unwaveringly smooth voice flowing over rigid drums, chilly string sections, and bombastic mafia-movie brass riffs; the crisply fractured samples; the aspiration toward gritty silkiness; the greater utility for head-nodding than for clubbing; the same story told and retold with different cribbed or invented slang. Vordul's rhymes are tight and confident, brimming with braggadocio and bolstered by shifting internal rhyming schemes. But without Vast Aire's more baroque, Pharoahe Monchian exhortations to distinguish them, they become a bit tedious before the record runs out-- especially as they doggedly cling to a metronomical mid-tempo meter. And while the stern, icy minimalism of the beats created by relative New York newcomers like Belief, Blockhead, Ruddy Rock, and The Prof would be fine grist for a rapper with more variation in his voice, they don't serve Vordul's utilitarian couplets and rhythmic regularity as well as the glitchy, thunderous IDM that enveloped Can Ox.</p><p>
<em>The Revolution of Yung Havoks</em> is a hip-hop record for diehard hip-hop heads, but it fails to illuminate and render as viscerally as the 90s NYCentric micro-drama rap it emulates. Not that it's entirely without distinction: The energetic delivery and morphing homonyms of C Rayz Walz's cameo on ""Spitamatic"" enlivens Vordul's more amorphous turn. Belief's striated, punchy beat on ""Blade"" pairs with an unusually forceful Vordul verse to good effect. Jean Grae's talents seem wasted on the unexceptional chorus of ""Believe"", but Can Ox reunion track ""Handle That"" delivers, boasting a sufficiently haywire beat by Omega One and Vast Aire's harshly enunciated, conversationally toned verses. But for those of us without firsthand experience in holding down corners and running blocks, Vordul's debut lacks the narrative excitement and vivid, idiosyncratic detail necessary for our imaginations to fill in the blanks and render it anything more than a passing pleasure.</p></div>"|8536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8536-the-revolution-of-yung-havoks/|7.0|Brian Howe

    Future</i>, the reality of his return is still difficult to get your brain around.  When he emerged from years of monastic exile to
    issue 2001's <em>Ten New Songs</em>, it was like discovering a long-deceased relative sitting in the parlor and patting their lap for you
    to come sit as if they'd never left.  Life after death suits Cohen.  He's always been a box of paradoxes: Canada's poet laureate
    singing songs for New York; a voice made more beautiful by its untaught commonplaceness; and, according to Anjani Thomas, ""the only
    man I know who pairs Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese with a 1982 Chateau La Tour.""</p><p>
<em>Dear Heather</em> is the 70-year-old singer's 11th studio recording, and it suits his age.  The backing music evokes NPR filler
    (you can either thank or curse producer Leanne Ungar for this)-- nocturnal smooth jazz, elevator sax lines, and aged hipster tropes--
    but Cohen's towering presence and deft songwriting breathe life into the lite-jazz arrangements, a reminder that the oft-abused genre
    is innately pleasant.  The juxtaposition of Cohen's canny sophistication with the fanciful music results in a smoothness with an edge;
    a razor wrapped in silk.</p><p>
    
    It's fitting that the man who returned from oblivion sings like a ghost: Cohen's voice is almost gone.  His resonant baritone has
    flattened and deepened to a papery whisper; he sounds how Tom Waits might if a powerful lozenge scoured away the rusty pots and pans
    clanging on his vocal cords.  But Cohen has always been adept at turning liabilities into advantages, and his voice scrapes powerfully
    over the evocative music.</p><p>
<em>Dear Heather</em> continues Cohen's longtime collaborations with Sharon Robinson and Anjani Thomas. Robinson-- a talented singer, songwriter, and producer-- has been working with Cohen since the late 1970s, and jazz singer Thomas has since 1984. Besides co-writing and arranging many songs on the album, both singers' angelic voices paint bright stripes across Cohen's broad swathes of gray and keep them from diffusing into aether. They're the cavorting muses to his bohemian elder statesman, propping up the weary lion in winter as he sings of sorrow and redemption.</p><p>
    
    The dark, wistful ""The Letters"" is a throwback to classic Cohen brooders like ""Last Years Man""; barely-there murmurs slink over ascetic piano and guitar. Cohen's stately stage whisper, ""Your story was so long/ The plot was so intense"", amplifies the aching loveliness of Robinson's chorus. The libidinous ""Because Of"" proves the old dog's still got some lead in his pencil. Over a percolating shuffle remindful of <em>Rain Dogs</em>-era Waits, Cohen indulges a bit of sly self-awareness: ""Because of a few songs wherein I spoke of their mystery/ Women have been exceptionally kind to my old age"". And the title track finds Cohen intoning one short verse (""Dear Heather, please walk by me again/ With a drink in your hand/ And your legs all white from the winter""), sometimes speaking the words and sometimes spelling parts of them-- all over a trilling circus organ, trumpets, and breathy harmonies. This is Cohen at his most playful and enigmatic; clipped motes of ephemeral photo-realism.</p><p>
    
    The second mode of <em>Dear Heather</em> is literally elegiac: More than a third of its songs are dedicated to passed friends and colleagues. ""Go No More A-Roving"" is a Lord Byron sonnet set to jazzy muzak, in memory of the great Canadian poet, novelist and pedagogue Irving Layton, who was Cohen's teacher at the Jewish parochial school Herzliah. ""On That Day"" is Cohen's 9/11 song, which he handles with his usual humility, responding to the scenery-chewing on both sides of the moral axis with a resigned, musical shrug of helplessness: ""I wouldn't know, I'm just holding the fort/ Since that day they wounded New York"". The song's simplicity-- all starry piano and springy Jew's harp (which is usually an antic, clownish embellishment, but which Cohen has proved able to use tastefully at least since ""Bird on a Wire"")-- imbues it with a weary sorrow that casts ripples throughout the album. It's immediately contrasted by ""Villanelle for Our Time"", dedicated to Frank Scott, which recasts the late poet's villanelle as a beatnik spoken word piece, and seems a spiritual tonic responding to ""On That Day"": ""From bitter searching of the heart/ Quickened with passion and with pain/ We rise to play a greater part"".</p><p>
    
    Ascribing a numerical value to Cohen feels like rating a sunrise or a religion; one feels absurdly insufficient. Because inaccuracy would be a ghastly dishonor to the candid spirit of Cohen's music, I wrestled prodigiously with my rating. Was I inflating it because of my regard for its author? This sort of lite-jazz is certainly outside of my usual purview. Would these songs still be enchanting if similarly sung by a less hallowed figure? I decided that the honest answers were yes and no, respectively, but that this did nothing to gainsay the rating. That authorship is a silent but vital aesthetic component of art is a point Borges incontrovertibly proved in ""Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote"", which I'll encapsulate with its final sentence: ""Would not the attributing of <em>The Imitation of Christ</em> to Louis Ferdinand Celine or James Joyce be a sufficient renovation of its tenuous spiritual counsels?"" As long as an album's impact is genuinely felt, it's inconsequential if the impact partially stems from the powerful aura of its creator.</p><p>
<em>Dear Heather</em> is gorgeous, quietly poignant rendering of autumnality. Only Cohen could have pulled it off. And unlike <em>Ten New Songs</em>, I can't stop listening to it, which seems the ultimate justification for praise. Above all else, it's an honest document of this stage of Cohen's life, and it therefore honors his lifelong commitment to unflinching self-scrutiny. With its scattered, melancholic requiems permeating their neighbor songs by osmosis, one can't help but feel the entire album amounts to Cohen preemptively penning his own eulogy. In doing so, he defies Dylan Thomas's directive to not go gentle into that good night; instead he whispers, whispers to the dying of the light. It's a perfectly apt home stretch for an oeuvre that has always been marked by grace, equanimity, and quiet dignity.</p></div>"|1530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1530-dear-heather/|8.0|Brian Howe

The Greatest Peep Show Ever then keeps on peeping for about 40 more seconds, when suddenly all three members of this disco-fuck troupe start chanting, ""Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!"" like they're on ""Sesame Street"". It's the audio equivalent of, say, the MILF Hunter going off-camera mid-hunt and putting on Groucho Marx glasses and a Dr. Seuss Cat hat before coming back and expecting us to pick up where we left off.</p><p>  Around that song's three-minute mark, Black Leotard Front play their cheapest, dirtiest trick, offering up ad nauseam a clumsy English translation of the song's Vorwort, replacing the original's self-involved whispers with militant matters of fact: ""I was leaving the office.""  ""I took off my dress.""  ""I put on my overcoat to surprise you in the flesh.""  By this point, ""Casual Friday"" is barely a fifth of the way through its 15-minute runtime, the three-disc <em>DFA Compilation #2</em> has hardly even started, and there we are, pants around ankles and red in the kisser. If this review was Uncle Milty, it would raise its palms and smirk.</p><p>  ""Casual Friday"" sums up DFA Records circa 2004 with startling accuracy.  The qualities that have typically characterized the label-- rapt attention to genre, an implicit skepticism of easy and less song-y dance music, a subtle sense of humor-- continue to crystallize as a slew of new additions (sound engineers Delia &amp; Gavin and the aforementioned Black Leotard Front, J.O.Y., Pixeltan, Liquid Liquid) expand and diversify its often pigeonholed roster.  These guys actually do give a shit, all the way down to the packaging and sequencing of <em>Compilation #2</em>, which collects the DFA's vinyl-only releases from this year and more than a few compilation-only exclusives. What could have been a mere anthology of the label's uniformly excellent 2004 output is, additionally, a meticulously assembled personal narrative.  This is a label that balances its musical and commercial aspirations with an earthy, no-bullshit disposition and-- let's say it-- the world's best fucking handclaps.</p><p>  Tracks like the lanky ""Casual Friday"", Pixeltan's sub-bass masterpiece ""Get Up/Say What (DFA Remix)"", and LCD Soundsystem's still unspeakably great ""Yeah"" are 10-minute dance songs with beginnings, middles, and ends; people who complain about the downtime on ""Get Up"" or the crass acid freakout finale of ""Yeah"" completely miss the point. Delia &amp; Gavin's Gottschingkind ""El Monte"" and the DFA remix of ""Rise"" are even more expansive, as patterns settle in and flesh out before the next move is made, a bravado afforded to only the most tightly-wound loops.</p><p>  The DFA's remix of J.O.Y.'s ""Sunplus"" wins the label's ""Most Bizarre Release Award""-- the reception to it has been mixed, and for many people this is the first DFA release they haven't liked-- but it's also possibly their most important record. James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy have worked on several unlikely acts at this point-- N.E.R.D. and ""She Wants To Move"" come to mind-- but in truth their high-carb basslines and unclamped hi-hats were making them fat, and it's about time they went on a diet. Like it or not-- and I like it-- their Slits-y, minimal ""Sunplus"" remix speaks to the team's crucial ability to change and stay the same all at once: Their malleability is on perfect display here. The label boasts further variety with Juan MacLean's crooked riddim ""Dance Hall Modulator Dub"" and Liquid Liquid's re-recording of ""Bellhead"". On the latter, Murphy and Goldsworthy admirably keep low profiles in the face of such personally influential living legends, merely trading the original's trash-can reverb for crisp percussion and about twenty more BPM.</p><p>  Old reliables (The Rapture's previously UK-only ""Alabama Sunshine"" and a dub mix of ""Sister Savior""; a fine drone remix of Black Dice's tour-only single ""Wastered"", fittingly renamed ""Wasteder""); and old favorites (LCD Soundsystem's ""Beat Connection""; Eye's remix of Black Dice's ""Endless Happiness"") fill out the rest of this musical annal, most notably touching upon The Rapture's departure from the DFA. Bygones are indeed bygones, though, and if anyone's really upset about that rift, the third disc of <em>Compilation #2</em> is a top-notch party mix with-- get this-- actual mixing.  Along with Beats In Space's Tim Sweeney, Tim Goldsworthy outdoes himself on practically every track transition: Jittery percussive swells on ""Bellhead"" creep early into ""Echoes"" and energize the song's descending figures; the cowbells and clean squeaks of ""Sunplus"" martial the beatless ""El Monte"" and reach through all the way into the beginning of Juan MacLean's ""Give Me Every Little Thing""; and at the end, ""Beat Connection"" fights with ""Yeah"" for volume, until both of them play together at full-blast.  In a word, it's glorious, a fitting old-meets-new, tongue-in-cheek gesture to conclude one of 2004's most worthwhile tales.</p><p> </p></div>"|2032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2032-dfa-compilation-2/|9.0|Nick Sylvester

<i>A word war will set off the keg<br/>
    My words of war!<br/>
    Should a word have two meanings?<br/>
    What the fuck for?<br/>
    Should words serve the truth?</i><br/>
    --Minutemen, ""Do You Want New Wave (Or Do You Want the Truth?)""</font></p><p>
    
    Let's dance with semantics. Perhaps The Soft Pink Truth's Drew Daniel revised the title of the Minutemen's classic ballad just because it's a clever phrase. Many audiences didn't know what the 80s punk legend was screaming about in concert. D. Boon and Mike Watt hollered blue-collar fuming about bosses in high castles. Their lyrics could be interpreted as Everyman frustration contorted into cubist shapes or mere beer napkin scribbles, but the selected passage from ""Do You Want"" is poignant. It argues that political language's barrier is its perpetual ambiguity, self-contradiction, and cliches. On his latest album, Daniel tackles that dilemma by slipping a neon-green cassette of house music on the P.A. when a mosh pit breaks out at a hardcore primal scream session.</p><p>
    
    Daniel's music thankfully never gives easy answers. His solo work and <i>musique concrete</i> tomfoolery in Matmos can sometimes confuse listeners about whether he's expressing genuine affection or ironic commentary. There's his remix of Missy Elliot's ""Get Ur Freak On"" where he clanged actual gold bars for ""bling-bling"" beats or his suave microhouse homage to the nosejob on ""California Rhinoplasty"", sampling godawful surgical scrapes and drills. <i>Do You Party?</i>, his 2003 debut album as The Soft Pink Truth, traced his roots as a go-go dancer in San Francisco's gay disco culture; cartoonishly skewering it all into autistic microhouse with stuttering R &amp; B divas, 80s new wave melodrama, and venereal beats for ""Big Booty Bitches"". The ""genuine affection"" factor rang there-- evoking more passion than the electroclash sold at the time. With <i>Do You Want New Wave</i>, his cover album of punk classics, he's on the offensive. Consider his robo-funk cover of the Angry Samoans' ""Homo-Sexual"", as he deadpans ""Screw your wife up the behind and tell your kids everything's fine."" Homophobia reduced to a sing-along for any rainbow parade. The irony can kill 20 men with one drop.</p><p>
    
    Daniel deftly retains punk's spirit of negation. Instead of remixing the originals by underground punk legends like Die Kreuzen, Minor Threat, Rudimentary Peni, and Crass, he pasteurizes their dogmatism and raw vitriol as disco calls. Daniel subverts by stripping away the distortion and lousy enunciation that cloaked the lyrics of these songs on record or in concert, and reveals their kinkiness. His disco element also dents the ""punk rocks, disco sucks"" ethos of snapping the young n' disaffected outta disco's narcotic escapism with anti-grooves. Although the ever-solemn Crass did release the galloping death-disco number ""Walls"".</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to say if <i>Do You Want</i> is nostalgic for Daniel's punk roots (the liner notes dedicate the record to his beloved Louisville hardcore scene of the late 80's), or a mocking bastardization. Hell, the record could be just a distraction from his Ph.D. studies at UC-Berkeley. The CD's inner sleeve features ""Dissertation Avoidance,"" a brainstorm list of the record's possible meanings like ""Escapist Nostalgia,"" ""Regressive Fantasies,"" and ""Ruining Sacred Truths.""</p><p>
    
    Daniel's music makes the original songs' social defiance sound terribly cute. Consider his fingerprints on Minor Threat's straight-edge anthem ""Out of Step"". The song is now a jock jam with a techno-pop rhythm slowed down to allow cheerleaders to stomp and clap along to, and chanteuse Dani Siciliano giving the Mary Poppins treatment to ""Don't smoke/ Don't drink/ Don't fuck/ At least I can fucking think."" Daniel even mixes in samples of a starch-collared doctor praising the listener for not smoking. ""Out of Step"" is now a jingle worthy of a DARE video aimed at sixth graders.</p><p>
    
    More faithful is Crass' declaration of revolt, ""Do They Owe Us a Living?"", where he razor-slashes with a bare, tech-house beat to let People Like Us's Vicki Bennett tell citizens in the unemployment line to overthrow their society and its ideals of a natural aristocracy. ""They'd live to see me dead,"" she sneers. Unfortunately, Daniel mares the song with wanky lasers and DSP'd ping-pong beats. His digital swordplay fares better on Die Kreuzen's ""In School"", which sounds like a <i>Do Your Party?</i> b-side with its stitched-together fragments of a dozen singers and robots, and a hypnotic disco cover of Rudimentary Peni's ""Vampire State Building"", on which he disintegrates the voice of fashion designer Jeremy Scott.</p><p>
    
    The brazen homophobia of ""Homo-Sexual"" still nags though. The Angry Samoans always tried too hard to offend for the sake of political incorrectness but Daniel's fellow Matman, Martin Schmidt, diminishes their impact with his rendition of Nervous Gender's ""Confession"". Singing through a coagulated vocoder over a Valley Girl-charming handclap, he announces, ""Jesus was just like me!/ A homosexual nymphomaniac/ Walking the streets of Galilee."" And then there's the giddily misogynistic Teddy &amp; The Frat Girls' ""I Owe it to the Girls"", where Daniel and Blevin Blectum duet to a rump-tickling, tech-house beat, singing, ""I can't get no pussy...relief...ride...ice cream/ I owe it to the girls."" These three songs are now dancefloor punch lines akin to DJ Assault's ""Ass and Titties""-- or ""Disco Duck"" for that matter. Firing between the eyes is the CD's design that equates a ""punk"" with a double-arrow bedroom companion.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, Daniel seems to be giggling at his punk past. He ends the album with an eerie, androgynous rendition of Styne and Robin's Broadway tune, ""Looking Back"", once sung by drag icon Carol Channing. The song is now a funeral wake with a dreary feedback tone that places silver dollars on the eyes of a mourning lullaby about how ""It's nice looking back at the past/ Full of memories that last/ Souvenirs of a life that was fast and fun/ Now it's done."" A fine ending for one of this year's most remarkable ""punk"" albums.</p></div>"|7315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7315-do-you-want-new-wave-or-do-you-want-the-soft-pink-truth/|8.5|Cameron Macdonald

Singer Greg Olin's husky voice croaks and offers you a beer before it slouches deep into your saved-from-the-garbage armchair. Now you're ready for some dozy, late-afternoon slacking.</p><p>
    
    And then you notice the lyrics. Olin casually drops bombshells such as opener ""The Will Now""'s ""I'm gonna cut your name into a willow/ I'm gonna push your face into my pillow"", as if to make sure you're paying attention. That's...cuddly. Or consider ""Strength in ###'s"" promise to ""Lie down with virgins/ And make credible conversions."" And when the lyrics aren't sexual, they're repetitive or full of obtuse images-- what is ""End Love""? In other places, Olin's lyrics are just plain cute, like when he plays the endearing counting games on ""Connection Time"" (which also comes in a French version). The songs are also self-aware: The record's most humorous moment is when, on album midpoint ""Shake the Walls"", Olin announces, ""This is not the best part/ The best part's coming later.""</p><p>
    
    The band's aesthetic fits perfectly on the Hush Records roster next to Blanket Music and The Places-- but even if the music lulls the listener, Olin's words regain your attention. His humor is sophomoric-- and that's not meant as an insult. It's jolting and invigorating without derailing the songs or playing for shock value. Olin's sense of humor also unexpectedly make the music more intimate: He dissolves the arm's-length distance at which you'd keep most crooners. Olin is here to engage you, with a joke or a scare, and the laughing female voice that half-joins him on some of the songs reminds you that he's aware of his audience.</p><p>
    
    Olin's arrangements are as subtle as his words-- he inserts little ""what was that?"" details with a deft sleight-of-hand: the digital flutter that opens the album, the harsh analog keyboard that plays the hook to ""The Will Now"", the tape glitch-y jerk near the start of ""Holding Your Arms"", the light keyboards that float beneath the album's guitar, piano, and drums. Guests show up from Norfolk and Western and Desert City Soundtrack-- dig the horns on ""Headphone Brigade""-- and when Olin promises us halfway through that the best song is coming up, he's probably referring to ""Strength in ###'s"", near the end of the record, which breathes enough vim into the synths and guitar to wake you up for the send off.</p><p>
    
    But with less than half an hour of music, <i>Yes Yes Okay Okay</i> doesn't do much more than soothe your nerves. While the lyrics try to convey wit and intelligence, the music doesn't coax much more than a smile. Even if a few songs linger, they don't make a deep impression. On the other hand, by insinuating his ideas instead of hammering you with them, Olin stops himself from acting ""clever"" or ""wacky,"" or jerking around the spotlight in an effort to make his jokes. He's just clever enough not to ruin the mood.</p></div>"|3657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3657-yes-yes-okay-okay/|7.1|Chris Dahlen

Worang transformed Uncut into a trad four-piece and cut back on their electronic flourishes; Fairley stuck with his flair for amphetamined beats, cramming the dancefloor with singles on labels such as Dumb-Unit and Kompakt Extra, for which he's contributed a pair of tracks to the <i>Speicher</i> series-- most notably last year's tanker-sized ""Octane"".</p><p>
    
    Fairley's singles embody the swaggering warmth of 1970s glam and 80s synth-pop, and his first full-length, <i>Touch Not the Cat</i>, continues in that vein, combining the stadium-sized spunk of T. Rex and Depeche Mode with rough microhouse beats. But it's when he shades closest to the track-y stomp of fellow pop-heads Matthew Dear and Superpitcher that Jake Fairley makes his mark. Fairley has always more pop-savvy than clinical, so it's not surprising that Fairley's vocal tracks are the album's best. Except for his slapdash Lou Reed drawl on ""Mosquito"", Fairley's detached drone is the perfect accoutrement for these night-dimmed tech-jams. Opener ""Nightstick"" is swanky aggro-grind with harsh static slamming against a throaty beat. The effect sounds like Depeche Mode cross-transmitted on 14 broken radios-- a few tuned in but most spitting out static or white noise. Fairley's blood-drained vocals add an ironic enthuasim to the song's harsh T. Raumschmiere-like throbs.</p><p>
    
    ""At Night"" opens with a classic schaffel beat as caustic electronic tones try to keep pace with its steady forward thrust. His voice bristles with recriminations for a girl always missing after dark. When he moans ""I'm losing control/ I'm losing my mind,"" his concern traces the polar necessities of acceptance and denial. The aching vocals give the rhythms a tension to work against, preventing it from submerging into sometimes unengaging rhythms.</p><p>
    
    ""All On Me"" quiets Fairley's voice to a whisper against a dirty beat and a hypnotic electronic loop that's hard to miss and harder to not fall for. The song makes fool's gold of genre-labeling; even a three-piece jug-band could make a melody like this sound stunning. The track is brimming with day-break optimism amidst the guilt of knowing you fuck up on a regular basis. Slowing into the rough electronics and a stubborn beat, the album closes as it opened-- with a highlight.</p><p>
    
    In between those two is a dearth of compelling tracks. ""Prussia"" plods on for almost six minutes without coalescing into a hook, while ""Dinklesburg"" regurgitates the same cranky chime-loop naked of the necessary subtle flourishes. There's no subtlety or nuance, just a cacophonous grind thriving on generic inertia. The only exception is the snowed-in mania of ""Radiator"".</p><p>
    
    Perhaps Fairley just needs a guitar player and full-time pop enthusiast like Worang as much as his former partner's band could use a deft electronic touch. Though each shows enough promise and creativity to keep a lazy eye on, the former partners' releases feel embryonic without the other's complements. Their division leaves the two competing in crowded fields-- the neon-pulse of German schaffel and the null-light of post-punk. Perhaps it's time to join hands again, boys.</p></div>"|3327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3327-touch-not-the-cat/|7.1|Derek Miller

But in Hutz's case, energy and stage presence trump his seemingly insincere stance as revolutionary Slavophile. When this energy is effectively translated onto record (see 2002's <i>Multi Kontra Culti vs. Irony</i> and 1999's <i>Voi-La Intruder</i>), the unparalleled spectacle of Gogol's legendary live show is palpable.</p><p>
    Hutz also has a reputable weekly DJ gig, which he frequently uses to open Gogol shows. He's built a solid reputation from those sets, which take elements of Balkan, Indian, Arab, and dancehall and meld them into inspired mindfucks, which-- in a club setting-- maintain the intensity of Gogol's sets. It makes sense that Hutz would eventually translate his DJ efforts to record, and on <i>Gogol Bordello vs. Tamir Muskat</i>, he teams with Gogol alumni Oren and Ori Kaplan, frequent opener and Israeli artist Victoria Hanna, and Big Lazy drummer Tamir Muskat to create a multicultural mix.</p><p>\xCA
    Plenty of apologists (myself included) would argue that in the case of both Gogol Bordello and the J.U.F. (""Jewish-Ukrainian Freundschaft"") collaboration, the live experience is a prerequisite to a full appreciation of Hutz's ambition. The prevailing style has been justifiably labeled ""What the Fuck,"" but the WTF aesthetic comes across as primarily conceptual. Lacking the atmosphere of a convincing live performance, Hutz's spontaneity dissipates and his tracks become monotonous. Each Gogol-quoting horn hook, ""Arab-dub-sextura"" moment, and Muskat/Kaplan-programmed beat feel labored and overly deliberate. Though individual songs at times maintain a distinctive momentum, the album as a whole is fleeting and forgettable, suggesting the exact kind of artificiality that has so long unfairly dogged Hutz's recorded efforts.</p><p>
    The album isn't without its inspired moments-- opener ""Gypsy Part of Town"" transforms a trademark Ori Kaplan sax figure into a relaxed funk line accompanied by a lazy Muskat preprogrammed beat, while Hutz personifies the texts that inform his haphazard mish-mash of revolutionary politics as imprisoned wolves breaking free from their cages. ""Roumania"" uses Hanna's disquieting vocal presence to complement a traditional, lopsided acoustic backdrop that stumbles through a repetitive horn pattern. ""Samiao's Day"" effectively replicates the energy of a climactic Gogol drum line finale.</p><p>
    Although Hutz brings his crazed intensity to most tracks-- and Hanna consistently textures her accompanying tracks with the evocative, urgent menace of her unique timbre and phrasing-- too many tracks quickly work into predictable grooves and proceed on auto-pilot. For the most part, the album's dub and funk workouts lack cohesion and force, coming across too frequently as calculated combinations of their diverse influences. Individual listening is ultimately taxing and unrewarding, making this a competent but tedious translation of Hutz's DJ sets, and a marginally entertaining side project to please Gogol diehards between releases.</p></div>"|4347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4347-gogol-bordello-vs-tamir-muskat/|5.9|David Moore

Their songs were cheeky punchlines-- ""Skintight"", ""Do You Wanna Hit It"", and ""All Messed Up""-- and they all had the same set of purrs, sneers, and distortion. Albums titles like <i>Turn 21</i> and <i>Spend the Night</i> were equally problematic-- nodding and winking, they seemed to trace the band's career alongside websites tracking the Olsen twins' crawl toward legal age. Even after <i>Spend the Night</i>'s sole thrill, ""Take It Off"", afforded The Donnas some grown-up success and MTV exposure, the group still seemed happy playing the role of teen-movie house band.</p><p>
<i>Gold Medal</i> tries to remedy that reputation with richer songwriting and a thicker sonic tip. In other words, it's not all riffs and swears. New ideas have appeared inside the Donnas' old put-up-your-dukes, pull-down-your-pants swagger; instead of constantly rewriting rock 'n' roll radio, they're dutifully working towards a unique sound. ""Don't Break Me Down"" burns slow and pays off with a chorus as subtle as the chilly bassline which runs throughout the track. It could be one of those occasional gems you hear on Loud 107's ""Turn Back the Rock"" weekend, right after the 700 millionth spin of ""Sweet Emotion"". Even a track like ""Friends Like Mine""-- despite placeholder lyrics and a pick-slide opening-- has more going for it than the typical Donnas songs. Much of the credit goes to Allison Robertson (formerly Donna R.-- the girls have finally done away with the Ramones-baiting aliases), whose guitar work has grown stronger with each album, but here she's really tearing it up, giving <i>Gold Medal</i> a more dynamic feel.</p><p>
    In the album's best stretches, the Donnas layer their image and influences over something they can call their own. Butch Walker deserves some credit for this transformation. His production is subtle, but it always highlights the right element of a song, whether it's the extra spice on Robertson's guitar in ""Friends"" or the continued emphasis on Brett Anderson's throaty vocals. For once she sounds more like a true frontperson than just the bitchy girl in the back of class. Unfortunately, the increased vocal presence also emphasizes Anderson's lyrical weaknesses. ""It's so hard to be on your own/ When you're holdin' it all alone."" Right. Fortunately Walker is always just a knob twist away from another saving grace. He integrates the album's array of backing vocals and handclaps, makes Maya Ford's formerly inaudible bass a true force, and amplifies Robertson's solos in ways that avoid miring them in cliches. He knows hard rock can't fully outrun cliche, which means the Donnas can't either. It's just party music, after all. But ideally, it still has some breadth-- the party extending beyond the kitchen-- and with Walker's help, The Donnas have fit the pieces together better than usual.</p><p>
    But <i>Gold Medal</i> is still too flawed to be The Donnas' finest hour. ""It's So Hard"" is another one of those loudmouth punchlines that fails to go anywhere, and lead single ""Fall Behind Me""-- as great as its twin-channel guitars sound-- isn't strong enough to compete in the current Return to Rock sweepstakes. ""Revolver"" goes for an acoustic/electric hybrid, but it's as empty as an album track from one of the junior Avril hopefuls. The title track is a slight improvement-- it's also acoustic, but has a great vocal hook in the chorus and ""ooh-wah-ooh"" harmonies that put it closer to <i>Dreamboat Annie</i> than The Donnas' usual Kiss 'n' Crüe strut. The recycled riffs and too-easy lyrical cheese are occasionally still in play. But on <i>Gold Medal</i>, even when they fail, it seems as if that failure is a result of The Donnas trying to carve their own identity rather than just being a cute cover band that ran out of ideas.</p></div>"|2422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2422-gold-medal/|5.5|Johnny Loftus

I had previously asked him why so many underground noiseniks were enthralled with Timbaland and the Neptunes' six-figure-charged per beat productions, and rupture further elaborated his answer onstage as he mixed with no trace of irony or contempt. His comrade and laptop-noise sevngali Kid606 also fondly connected the dots between noise and pop during a DJ set at the city's Peacock Lounge-- having the Tom Tom Club's ""Genius of Love"" understandably crawl into bed with hardcore techno. The audience of shag-carpeted art students inhaled it all.</p>
<p>On <i>Oh, So Now You Fuckers Wanna Dance?</i>, the Kid (Miguel Depedro) and cult-rapper Cex (Rjyan Kidwell) continue to damn the underground's isolationism from the mainstream by concocting DJ mixtapes for high school halftime shows. In short, it's gallantly dumb booty music that is often a foot away from being meat-market fodder. The record is the third chapter in ""soundclash"" label Violent Turd's <i>Shotgun Wedding</i> series where copyright-abusing artists split time on the same mix record.</p>
<p>Cex and the Kid's 20-30 minute DJ sets mostly avoid DSP vandalism in favor of letting their Miami bass-style THUNK, THUNK, THUNKs and MTV-sold rappers speak for themselves. That deep respect also compromises their strong personalities. Miguel is known for shattering techno and hip-hop into a million pieces, and later prancing about in Hello Kitty/Paul Frank synth-pop to further disturb; Rjyan defies any anti-white rapper critic by existing in his genuine world of parody, video-game addiction relapses, and counter-IDM ethic. So although the dumb-dance aesthetic isn't a radical departure from their oeuvres, it'd still be nice to hear them disrupt and baffle the dancefloor with whatthefuckwasthat? moments.</p>
<p>Miguel's ""Up From DaBassment"" locks a booty-groove that for all of its 26 minutes is all caffeinated high and no relief. He sticks to a few rhythms all cranked up to +50 on his turntables' pitch controls. Stumbling into the room and asking everyone if they're at the right party before leaving are 50 Cent, Le Tigre, 'Lil Kim, Busta Rhymes, Black Flag, Trick Daddy, Elephant Man, Outkast, the Cardigans, and Daft Punk. Miguel then eases things down with Sparklehorse and Electric Company's shimmering guitar ballads. His next set, ""Gizm Collission"" is intoxicated with an acid hardcore vibe that begins with his own Amsterdam 4:20 street hootenanny ""The Illness"" and then indulges in four sexual predator anthems from DJ Assault. Aphex Twin's peyote-oiled didgeridoo steals the show and refreshingly opens up a vivid mindscape amid the percussive bludgeons.</p>
<p>Cex's ""DJ No Evil BaltiMix 6000"" is a more produced affair-- chopping up samples beyond recognition and rhythmically looping them to near-overkill. Half of his set glides on the Jungle Brothers' classic ""Sounds of the Safari"" breakbeat where the snapped beats seems to strut a few inches above the ground. Megaphone-amplified crunk-hollers and Pepsi-commercial stabs of melodies also abound, with a brilliant moment of Motown-soul upping the funk.</p>
<p>Despite expectations of timely subversion, who cares if Cex and the Kid don't toss molotov cocktails at the mainstream? Especially when music like this can make the dancefloor undead. As what the ""Genius of Love"" taught us: ""Who needs to think when your feet just go?""</p></div>"|4410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4410-shotgun-wedding-vol-3-oh-so-now-you-fuckers-wanna-dance-with-cex/|7.2|Cameron Macdonald

After eight years of making music at a near-compulsive clip, the band finally thought to put its newest collection, <i>Rare Wood</i>, on CD and give it proper distribution. Prior to that, their releases were issued only as hand-packaged CD-Rs or on LP, leaving fans to sift through record fairs and shakedown exotic music vendors for copies. But the response to <i>Rare Wood</i> was evidently enthusiastic enough to warrant a second CD release: a reissue of 2003's <i>The Trickle Down Theory of Lord Knows What</i>.</p><p>
    
    Some would argue that part of Sunburned Hand's appeal lies in their scarcity but with music this impenetrable, they're not gonna crossover no matter how hard they try. If the band doesn't evoke enough of a socially aloof, politically apathetic vibe in their music, the title of this album is a reference to the famously-misleading Reagan-era economic doctrine, and resembles the caustic appellation the band gave its charter release, <i>Shit Spangled Banner</i>. But I'd be surprised if Sunburned Hand spent their Sunday mornings flipping through the Op-Ed section of the <i>Times</i>; after all this is a band whose leader, Jon Moloney, told me its music sounded best after imbibing strange drug cocktails.</p><p>
    
    But one need not be too wrecked to enjoy <i>Trickle Down</i>. It's a more engrossing beast than its predecessor. It dominates any environment in which it's played, coaxing the listener into a trance-like state through its use of endlessly repetitive phrases, distant and heavily reverbed vocals, and sustained textures. Much of Sunburned's music is like this but whereas previous releases such as <i>Headdress</i> are more blissed out, <i>Trickle Down</i> is darker and more meditative. The opening track, ""Spell it Out"", is even propelled by unintelligible, Shaman-esque chanting. Appropriately enough for this unalloyed collection of left-as-is jams, the track cuts off abruptly just as its lumbering central rhythm seems to be picking up. Five of the record's tracks end with a curt clip followed by a snippet of a seemingly unrelated bit of music.</p><p>
    
    ""Show of Hands"" is the album's effulgent anomaly, a track on which the ambience is turned down and one can actually hear plaintive acoustic and electric guitar dabbles poking through the mix. From the warm and fuzzy but distant guitar sound to the scattered vocal ruminations, <i>Trickle Down</i> is conspicuously lo-fi, even by Sunburned Hand standards. We're talking one or two mics here, tops, but the poor quality only enhances the album's immersive, otherworldly aura.</p><p>
    
    ""The Easy Ease"" and ""Always Correct"" are the album's shortest and quietest tracks. They're also the least interesting. The former does without rhythm, relying instead on warped wormhole drones and occasional flashes of cymbal; the latter is basically a drum circle. The songs aren't bad, merely soporific, and only inhibit the flow of the album insofar as they might cause the listener to black out.</p><p>
    
    But whatever Sunburned Hand lack in consistency they sure know how to make up for with superb finales. On the somewhat disappointing Rare Wood, the band saved grace with the fantastic ""Gyp Hawkin'"", a verdant, synth-spotted gem that trod through 10 minutes of wayward improvising without losing its mystic groove. Here, the closer again provides the strongest number. ""Rivershine"" siphons the piecemeal drone-and-moan of the previous four tracks into a momentous build-up that goes up, up, and away, tearing through each layer of the atmosphere in a torrid ascent to stellar calm. Once the band break through, it's a slow, steady drift, Earth in the rearview along with all the politics and formalities they never cared much for anyway.</p></div>"|7571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7571-the-trickle-down-theory-of-lord-knows-what/|7.2|Sam Ubl

There were several reasons for the record's general lack of recognition, but the neglect was at least partially due to the probability that nobody really knew which pocket to put it in. Was it leftfield electronic pop? Is Ornelius Mugison a Smog/Will Oldham-type bedroom prophet channeling the spirit of George Harrison? Is he a dime store Tom Waits trying to get a new flea circus up and running? Mugison listeners may have wanted answers but <i>Lonely Mountain</i> stubbornly provided only questions.</p><p> 
    
    Unfortunately, the arrival of <i>Niceland</i>-- Mugison's soundtrack to Icelandic director Fridrik Thor Fridriksson's first English-language film-- may only further muddy the waters. Not only does Mugison continue his flagrant genre-busting, but he does so under the natural constraints of the soundtrack form, making it more difficult than ever to know exactly what he's hoping to achieve and how far his music might one day eventually take us.</p><p>
    
    As is often the case with soundtracks, it's difficult to judge the music of <i>Niceland</i> when divorced from its cinematic context. Fridriksson's movie, from what I can gather, is some sort of fairy-tale love story. (I can't be sure, since it hasn't yet opened at my local cineplex and in all likelihood never will.) Most of Mugison's pieces here are very short, and several are barely more than fragmentary sketches surely intended as unobtrusive incidental music. Random bits of film dialogue weave in and out, revealing little in the way of plot or emotive intent. Melodic themes are repeatedly thumbed over and then discarded.</p><p>
    
    But even within this rigid, confined structure Mugison finds space to flex his considerable imagination, and the results are as dazzling as they are flummoxing. Tantalizing instrumental tidbits like ""Move On"" or ""Blessuo Sorgin"" combine electronics and acoustic instruments in a way that suggests Four Tet performing a score by Angelo Badalamenti, but they're here and gone so quickly you don't even get a chance to ask directions. Other tracks like ""To the Bank"" or ""Poke a Pat (Take 2)"" find him singing and playing guitar with an almost Skip Spence-like air of solitude, announcing blank lyrical mysteries like ""My bad thoughts have made me good.""</p><p> 
    
    Perhaps most impressive are the four versions of the film's main theme, entitled ""I'd Ask"", a simple waltz that Mugison first introduces as an acoustic country shuffle then reshapes into Waitsian carnival tilt utilizing piano, accordions, woozy carrousel rhythms, and pump organ. On these variations we're best able to fully hear the restless flowering of Mugison's creativity and marvel at his inventive chutzpah, as he makes the song's clean repetitive melody sound constantly refreshed and engaging.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album even his most conventional soundtrack material contains interjections of such dissonance or eccentricity that you're left wondering what could possibly be happening onscreen for which this music would be appropriate. Ultimately, though, <i>Niceland</i> is likely to leave you feeling a bit unsatisfied and perhaps impatient for the day when Mugison can put together another project more truly his own to thoroughly unleash his burgeoning talent.</p></div>"|5613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5613-niceland/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

You probably enjoy making, giving, and receiving mixes. The question is whether or not you're willing to pay regular CD price for one, even taking into consideration that its creator is an indie celebrity of, presumably, the most refined and immaculate tastes.</p><p>  Mixtapes are great for self-expression, for deepening interpersonal relationships, and for allowing non-musicians to participate in creating music's context. The creation of a successful mixtape is a delicate, nuanced art, and the phrase itself is so entrenched that it persists despite the primacy of CDs. But it seems dubious that such a populist, grassroots phenomenon can make the transition to regulated commerce and remain intact-- can Lytle's offering truly even be considered a mixtape?</p><p>  Collecting previously released music from various rock bands on a CD isn't a new idea; we simply call them compilations instead of mixes, which identifies by omission a couple crucial characteristics of the mixtape-- it must be free, and created specifically for the recipient. As such, Lytle's mix seems like a compilation in disguise. It was created for an unknown audience, and he sure as hell isn't giving it away. But while most compilations are united by a theme such as genre, label, time period, or subject matter, Lytle's is built upon the mixtape keystone of Songs I Like, and is being marketed as one as well.</p><p>  Often, the tapes you or I make are influenced by their recipients-- romantic songs for a significant other, heartbreaking songs for an ex, songs with happy associations for friends with shared history, etc. Since Lytle's mix is for strangers who only know him through his music, it seems prudent that, for the most part, the songs he selected sound quite a bit like his own band. Lush yet sleek and slightly sterile is the dominant style of <em>Below the Radio</em>, and one can easily imagine Grandaddy playing Beck's weary, 50s-style pop ballad ""We Live Again"", Beulah's gleaming, harmony-laden ""Burned by the Sun"", Earlimart's creeping wash of beeps and strings, ""Color Bars"", and Snow Patrol's frosty guitar anthem ""Run"". </p><p>  Because the songs are so redolent of Grandaddy, <em>Below the Radio</em> has a sense of continuity.  The record flows through a polished initial section that culminates with the velvety jangle-pop of Goldenboy's ""Wild Was the Night"" and then shifts to a looser mode that includes Fruit Bats' comparatively shambolic ""The Little Acorn"", the four-track folk and cracking vocals of Home's ""Comin' Up Empty Again"", and the rickety, key-hopping charm of Little Wings' ""Sand Canyon""-- the melody of which is strikingly similar to the Decemberists' ""I Was Meant for the Stage"".  So the mix is well-sequenced, with no jarring transitions and even some that are ingeniously seamless (the percolating drone that closes Beulah's track seems to naturally birth the heart-rate monitor pulse that opens Earlimart's).  The record is closed by its only previously unreleased track, Grandaddy's ""Nature Anthem"", a pleasant if undistinguished campfire sing-along that reasserts Lytle's kindred spirit with the songs he selected. </p><p>  Lytle should also be credited for avoiding obfuscation. Let's not shit ourselves-- when we make mixes, we don't always just choose songs we hope the recipient will enjoy. We create palimpsests of our personalities, and the urge to fudge is strong. You know that Swell Maps song you always put on mixes even though you never listen to it, knowing that the recipient will be impressed and pretend to like it as well? That's not included here. There are no hipster oddities or historical remnants on <em>Below the Radio</em>. The oldest and probably weirdest track is Pavement's 1995 melange of detuned organs and ratcheting embellishments, ""Motion Suggests"". Instead of presenting us with difficult, cool songs we'll start skipping after a couple listens, Lytle has packed his mix with more melodic and accessible fare, which is admirable-- if it's hard for us not to want one person to think we like Merzbow, how hard would it be to pass up the chance to make <em>thousands</em> think we like Merzbow? </p><p>  There's one more mixtape pleasure that we've yet to address-- on any good mix, the listener will inevitably come away with a new band to cherish and seek out. Somehow, until I heard <em>Below the Radio</em>, I'd managed to avoid ever listening to Giant Sand. After hearing ""Bottom Line Man""-- a lovely, sly ballad that closely resembles one of my favorite bands, Silver Jews-- this will certainly be remedied. The discovery of a new favorite is worth the price of admission; perhaps there's a similar treasure for you to exhume from <em>Below the Radio</em>, or an old favorite to rediscover. </p><p> </p></div>"|3548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3548-below-the-radio/|7.3|Brian Howe

Earlier this year, El-P made an unexpected leap into jazz-fusion territory, following DJ Spooky's footsteps by producing an installment of the Thirsty Ear label's Blue Series Continuum project. Matthew Shipp and other Thirsty Ear regulars worked with El-P on several loose compositions (""Sunrise Over Bklyn"" was released as an EP last year), and the result is a compelling synthesis of the hip-hop producer's talents and the solid ensemble work of the Blue Series collective.</p><p>
    
    El-P's edits and subtle production work strengthens the ensemble's more indulgent moments. Shipp's piano accompaniment typically grounds the album in discernible structure, but on ""Sunrise Over Bklyn"", El-P's tactful synth highlights divert attention from the pianist's uncharacteristically clumsy performance. Shipp's vamping on that track seems particularly overwrought, and it overwhels Roy Campbell and Steve Swell's excellent horn arrangements. Shipp is also disruptive on the album's bookends, both titled ""Please Leave (Yesterday)"" (variations on Charles Aznavour's ""Yesterday When I Was Young""), embracing grandiose lounge-y flourishes that offset the album's carefully layered production.</p><p>
    
    El-P sometimes seems reluctant to interfere with the ensemble's improvisation, which is a shame considering that the album's strongest tracks show him taking the reins from individual players. A live hip-hop beat serves as the foundation to the spacious fusion jam ""Get Your Hand Off My Shoulder, Pig"", and the dense production of ""Intrigue in the House of India""-- ranging from bossanova piano and percussion to dark trip-hop layering-- displays the expansive potential of the project. ""When the Moon Was Blue"" features sampled vocals by El-P's father, Harry Keys, and finds a compelling balance between the traditional jazz influences embodied in Keys' gruff jazz delivery and his son's hip-hop collage editing style.</p><p>
    
    The album occasionally succumbs to meandering improvisation and crosses the line between exploratory improv and tedious jamming.  ""Get Modal"" starts off on the wrong foot with a lengthy bit of arbitrary studio chatter and never exceeds its basic bass-driven fusion pattern. ""Something Is Wrong"" is a generally aimless mix of synths, samples, and the endless variation and repetition of an irritating piano theme.</p><p>
    
    This isn't entirely the fault of these usually reliable musicians.

Earlier this year, El-P made an unexpected leap into jazz-fusion territory, following DJ Spooky's footsteps by producing an installment of the Thirsty Ear label's Blue Series Continuum project. Matthew Shipp and other Thirsty Ear regulars worked with El-P on several loose compositions (""Sunrise Over Bklyn"" was released as an EP last year), and the result is a compelling synthesis of the hip-hop producer's talents and the solid ensemble work of the Blue Series collective.</p><p>
    
    El-P's edits and subtle production work strengthens the ensemble's more indulgent moments. Shipp's piano accompaniment typically grounds the album in discernible structure, but on ""Sunrise Over Bklyn"", El-P's tactful synth highlights divert attention from the pianist's uncharacteristically clumsy performance. Shipp's vamping on that track seems particularly overwrought, and it overwhels Roy Campbell and Steve Swell's excellent horn arrangements. Shipp is also disruptive on the album's bookends, both titled ""Please Leave (Yesterday)"" (variations on Charles Aznavour's ""Yesterday When I Was Young""), embracing grandiose lounge-y flourishes that offset the album's carefully layered production.</p><p>
    
    El-P sometimes seems reluctant to interfere with the ensemble's improvisation, which is a shame considering that the album's strongest tracks show him taking the reins from individual players. A live hip-hop beat serves as the foundation to the spacious fusion jam ""Get Your Hand Off My Shoulder, Pig"", and the dense production of ""Intrigue in the House of India""-- ranging from bossanova piano and percussion to dark trip-hop layering-- displays the expansive potential of the project. ""When the Moon Was Blue"" features sampled vocals by El-P's father, Harry Keys, and finds a compelling balance between the traditional jazz influences embodied in Keys' gruff jazz delivery and his son's hip-hop collage editing style.</p><p>
    
    The album occasionally succumbs to meandering improvisation and crosses the line between exploratory improv and tedious jamming.  ""Get Modal"" starts off on the wrong foot with a lengthy bit of arbitrary studio chatter and never exceeds its basic bass-driven fusion pattern. ""Something Is Wrong"" is a generally aimless mix of synths, samples, and the endless variation and repetition of an irritating piano theme.</p><p>
    
    This isn't entirely the fault of these usually reliable musicians.  El-P's hip-hop production work has lagged recently, and <i>Collecting the Kid</i>, a scrapbook documenting his many recent production projects, underscores this.

    Midwestern roots-rock band to arty urban ensemble.  The change has had both positive and negative effects
    on the group, leading them not only to create what is widely considered to be one of this century's first
    truly classic albums, but also to follow it with the self-consciously jammy <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>, a
    calculatedly ""difficult"" record whose 10- and 15-minute marathons divided the group's fanbase and drew
    mixed reactions from critics.</p><p>
    
    In light of this transfiguration, it seems logical that we now have <i>The Wilco Book</i>.  If you always
    loved liner notes, check this shit out-- these liners are so ridiculous that the music is purely an
    afterthought.  Okay, that's not strictly true.  Or it's at least not fair.  <i>The Wilco Book</i> provides
    a visual representation of the band's state of mind circa 2002-2004, as it underwent its most difficult
    changes: the turnover of membership, and the complete overhaul of the band's sound.  That said, don't come
    looking for gossip or dirt, because it ain't here.  The most controversial item is the revelation that
    Mikael Jorgensen had to ban Jeff Tweedy from playing slap bass in the control room.  Jay Bennett?  He's
    alluded to briefly in an essay.  Max Johnston and Ken Coomer?  Consigned completely to the memory hole.
    Wilco did not set out to make their autobiography here, and they don't talk about their past much at all
    in these blog-like ruminations.</p><p>
    
    Their writing is surprisingly humble, though-- Jeff Tweedy seems to abhor talking himself up, and Mikael
    Jorgensen, whose contributions are huge (especially for such a new member) lends massive insight into the
    band's recording and rehearsal process.  Glenn Kotche's drawings of percussion instruments-- ""Inglenntions""
    Tweedy calls them-- are amusing and poignant, as are Tweedy's calming exercises, including sheets on which
    he's written the numbers 1-100.  The band's sound engineers and techs chip in their own thoughts on live
    sound and equipment, and the inimitable Walter Sear of Sear Sound Studios fame tells his story candidly.
    But then there are the essays by Henry Miller and Rick Moody, which I fall asleep just thinking about.
    Miller's was written in 1962 and is a ponderous musing on watercolors and about a million other things,
    while Moody deconstructs the Wilco discography album by album.  The analytical overreach in Moody's essay
    is so embarrassing that I'm surprised the band wound up including it.  Put it this way: Would you publish
    photos of someone giving you a limp handjob?</p><p>
    
    Truth told, you could say that this tome's text exists primarily to provide the illusion of substance beyond
    imagery.  And that wouldn't necessarily be an insult, as <i>The Wilco Book</i>'s agenda is clearly visual.
    Near the back, there's a brief (almost hidden) mention of Hipgnosis, the company whose artwork adorned many
    a prog-rock album cover in the 70s, which is revealing-- this book isn't meant as a comment on the music
    that comes with it so much as a visual accompaniment.  And at that, it's succeeds beautifully.  I didn't
    want to touch the middle pages with Fred Tomasselli's stunningly complex pattern art while eating my foccacia
    because I was afraid I might ruin it.</p><p>
    
    And, oh right: How's the music?  Well, naturally, for the hardest of the Wilco corps, the music is the
    thing, yes.  And the disc, which compiles material from the recording sessions leading up to <i>A Ghost Is
    Born</i>, has its share of worthy material.  It also has its share of <i>un</i>worthy material, so there's
    some trade-off, certainly.  Do you need ""Hamami""?  It's a few minutes of the band members dropping percussive
    objects in a room with great acoustics more or less at random, and that's exactly what it sounds like.  But
    you might-- if you are one of said xtreme fans-- need the lovely alternate version of <i>Ghost</i>'s ""Hummingbird"",
    which features a clubby kickdrum and actually fits the mood and tenor of that album better than the version
    that made the cut.</p><p>
    
    Several of these tracks are edits of lengthy jam sessions, and a few stick well-- opener ""Pure Bug Beauty""
    in particular.  It reminds me a lot of Califone's <i>Deceleration</i> series, with lovely autoharp and
    piano, yet also feels similar in tone to the outro of ""Reservations"" or the intro to ""I Am Trying to Break
    Your Heart"".  ""What Good Am I"" was recorded in a Perth, Australia hotel room by ex-member Leroy Bach, Tweedy
    and Jorgensen, and it's perfect, right down to the lo-fi quality and off-the-cuff performance.  My favorite
    of these songs is the instrumental ""Diamond Claw"", a contender for <i>Ghost</i> that was left off... why?
    It has beautiful, George Harrison/Segovia guitar runs, haunting percussion, pretty piano, and the kind of
    direct emotional appeal found in Wilco's more conventional earlier work.</p><p>
    
    So what to make of this whole package, then?  Well, choosing just one rating was a chore.  It's a great
    book as far as showpieces go, and it does contain a lot of great information for fans, even if it did make
    me hate Rick Moody.  Wilco being a rock band, though, it's the music that most people will come for, and
    that rates only fair, with seven or eight good-to-great tracks balanced by a handful of ugly little ducklings
    that never got to be swans.  If you're serious about this band-- and I mean, like, <i>deathly</i> serious--
    go for it.  But if you just dropped in to see what condition their condition was in, hold off and let them
    carve a place in your life first.  Once they've done that, you can decide if it's worth adding this to it.</p></div>"|8681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8681-the-wilco-book/|7.5|Joe Tangari

With the inhospitable monotony of its countryside, its brutally unforgiving winters, and summers when the crops either wither from no rain or are pummeled by fist-sized hailstones, the upper plain states practically beg travelers to keep on moving, assuring them that something better is bound to appear just over the next horizon.</p><p>
<i>The West Is the Future</i>, Kid Dakota's second album for Low's Chairkickers Union label, is steeped in the sound of the open prairie. With assistance from Low bassist Zak Sally, drummer Christopher McGuire, and guitarist Erik Appelwick, Jackson's songs are filled with vast, empty spaces frequently interrupted by turbulent dust storms and winds which carry distant smoke signals and the barest echoes of cowboy campfire twang. Jackson's silvery voice flows through this parched scenery like water from a glacier-fed spring, making him sound like a Badlands version of Thom Yorke.</p><p>
    Throughout the album, Jackson looks upon those seeking solace from the harsh realities of this world with a sympathetic mixture of pity and scorn. On opener ""Pilgrim"" he sings, ""Howdy there pilgrim/ You're not transcendental/ There's nothing beyond you/ There's nothing to hope for"" with the head-shaking disapproval of a pioneer watching his new neighbor building a rickety cabin in the flood plain. This theme of futility continues on the Sparklehorse-like epic ""Homesteader"" (""The windmills are spinning to no avail. But nature's indifferent/ It's beyond God's control"") while the guitars spit sand and the background vocals of Low's Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker circle like hungry crows.</p><p>
    Regrettably, there are points where Jackson loses the map and succumbs to the pitfalls of narrative songwriting, as on the stereotype-ridden reservation portrait ""Pine Ridge"" (""With their government check they go buy liquor/ and it makes their thoughts grow dim and dimmer""), a track that's still almost saved by the closing powwow pound of Sally and McGuire.\xCA Less fortunate is the over-long dirge ""Starlight Motel"" which operates under the cliched assumption (inspired by Norman Bates and David Lynch) that mysterious evil forces lurk behind every blinking ""Vacancy"" sign in the country.</p><p>
    Also less-than-completely-successful is ""10,000 Lakes"", a song that's very obviously a deeply personal tribute to Jackson's current home: Minnesota. In addition to all those lakes, Minnesota is also home to several prominent drug treatment centers-- including one where Jackson was able to overcome his own chemical dependency. Given that heavy emotional backdrop, it seems odd that Jackson spends so much of the song trying to lighten the mood with throwaway lines like ""I didn't come for ice-fishing/ I didn't come for duck huntingÉI'm no fan of the Vikings or subzero wind chills."" These smirking jokes ring hollow, especially when contrasted with the understated beauty of the song's acoustic arrangement and Jackson's slippery, elongated delivery of the heartfelt chorus ""I came for the taper/ I came to get better.""</p><p>
    But although there are some rough patches to negotiate, <i>The West Is the Future</i> contains ample evidence of an ambitious, talented band just beginning to find its legs.\xCA Judging from the themes of these songs, Kid Dakota wouldn't approve overly optimistic predictions of their future. So suffice it to say that here the band displays a potential similar to what you might've detected on Modest Mouse's earliest releases had you been paying better attention, and that it should be fun to see what Jackson and his cohorts can deliver. </p></div>"|4587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4587-the-west-is-the-future/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

It flirted with cartoonishness, but thanks to the band's inventive overlay of organic and synthetic sounds and singer Ambrosia Parsley's honey-and-barbed-wire voice was ultimately more substantive. Despite that record's glowing reviews and Shivaree's modest audience, their 2002 follow-up, <i>Rough Dreams</i>, never saw release in the U.S.; to this day, it's available to American listeners only as a pricey import.</p><p>
    Earlier this year, ""Goodnight Moon""-- a standout track from <i>I Oughtta Give You</i>-- was included on the <i>Kill Bill 2</i> soundtrack, introducing Shivaree to a wider audience. Perhaps as a result of that exposure, the band's third full-length, <i>Who's Got Trouble?</i>, is slated for domestic release in January, with this EP, <i>Breach</i>, preceding it by a few months.</p><p>
    As its name implies, <i>Breach</i> is something like a partial birth: In addition to two new covers and a non-album track, the EP contains two songs from <i>Who's Got Trouble?</i> One of those is a cover of Brian Eno's ""The Fat Lady of Limbourg"", which Shivaree translates into a covert ops blues strut, driven by Danny McGough's chugging organ. Replacing Eno's saxophone with a guitar and piano, the song sounds evocatively conspiratorial-- topical in a vague way, but never overbearing-- as it describes a Pynchonesque underground network of agents, operatives, and waxen eggs.</p><p>
    Compared to that song, ""I Close My Eyes"" proves less of a departure for the band-- it would sound right at home on <i>I Should Give You</i> but it shows off their collective strengths to much better effect. It sounds like a cousin to ""Goodnight Moon"": both have strong melodies and instant hooks with lyrics about domestic ingenuity. Where ""Goodnight Moon"" was about the fear of being home alone and the precautions taken against imagined predators, on ""I Close My Eyes"" Parsley sings from the perspective of a beleaguered mother: ""I close my eyes so I can dream of ways to keep you occupied/ So I can lock you up and we'll keep it classified."" Whether she's addressing that statement to the child or the father is unclear, but Parsley sounds conniving instead of whining, certain she'll get her way if only she can figure out her best strategm.</p><p>
    Like her best songs, ""I Close My Eyes"" reveals an imagination hard at work, and the confidence in her voice and the concrete details in her lyrics imply that she could get herself out of any jam. That's precisely why the two non-album covers seem so disappointing: Both John Cale and Mike Scott are gifted songwriters, but Parsley sounds better singing her own material. Cale's ""Fear Is a Man's Best Friend"" is a lulling ode to paranoia, but despite Duke McVinnie's impressive bass work-- it never sounds as urgent as it should. And Parsley's duet with Ed Harcourt on the Waterboys' ""Strange Boat"" reveals little chemistry between the two singers.</p><p>\xCA
    Much better is the blend of vocals on the Shivaree original ""657 Bed B"", a sleepy-eyed duet with Verbena's Scott Bondy. As Shivaree provide credible C&amp;W; backing, he and Parsley sing about a fateful hospital stay and their voices blend perfectly as they rhyme ""goosies"" with ""moosies"" without sounding cutesy. That the two best songs here-- ""I Close My Eyes"" and ""657 Bed B""-- are originals speaks either to Shivaree's unique strengths as a band or to their weaknesses choosing covers. Straddling the line between for-fans-only and good-cheap-introduction-to-the-band, <i>Breach</i> accomplishes its chief mission-- to whet appetites for their next full-length.</p></div>"|7784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7784-breach-ep/|6.9|Stephen Deusner

By now, indie labels know the formula like a music-savvy University of Chicago grad student: one disc of hits, one disc of ""rarities,"" maybe a DVD.  It's the stuff holiday bonuses are made of!  Merge launched 2004's opening salvo, following up their 10-year-anniversary comp <em>Oh, Merge</em> with a sweeping 15-year retrospective, <em>Old Enough 2 Know Better</em>.</p><p>
    
    Now Matador is embracing its move into its pimply teenage years, too, and is releasing a three-disc set to prove it. <em>Matador at 15</em> kills 'em with quantity in the dubious tradition of 1999's directionless <em>Everything Is Nice</em> and 1997's epoch-defining <em>What's Up Matador</em>.  For many, Matador was the first label to remind us that we weren't ""blind or broken-eared,"" as Pretty Girls Make Graves' Andrea Zollo puts it in propulsive, well-picked opener ""This Is Our Emergency"".  But the new set is limited to tracks recorded after its predecessor, which means you've come to the wrong place to give your little brother a taste of pre-fame Modest Mouse.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, the 00s have been kind to Matador founders Gerard Cosloy and Chris Lombardi.  There will never be another <em>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</em>, but a couple of people got pretty passionate about a record called <em>Turn on the Bright Lights</em>. The New Pornographers and Pretty Girls Make Graves released well-received records, running the gamut from clever power-pop to angular, passionate punk rock.  Matador veterans Cat Power, Yo La Tengo and Stephen Malkmus are still releasing solid indie rock.  And if that doesn't blow it all away, wait 'til Mission of Burma reach for their-- well, you know.</p><p>
    
    So this comp has a shitload of great bands, then?  You bet your vintage GBV concert tee.  Is the price right?  It'll run you around $13 for 34 tracks and 12 videos.  So this is fucking great, right?  You know, I also like beer.  Sometimes I even buy good beer.  Once, gazing at a pool of Brooklyn Brewery black chocolate stout framed beneath me in porcelain, I had a revelation: something about ""the sum of the parts.""  Seriously, raise your hand if you've been waiting with bated Dorito breath for Preston School of Industry dance remixes (thanks for being honest, Mr. Stairs).  How many times do you really plan to watch a jokey video of The Wisdom of Harry doing their best ""Girl from the North Country"" impression?</p><p>
    
    It's not that <em>Matador at 15</em> isn't impressive. The ""greatest hits"" disc is consistently good, if not great. Along with the obvious favorites, Cornelius holds up particularly well-- I had no idea I'd still like the sampledelic schizopop of ""Drop"" so much. Even Belle &amp; Sebastian makes a delightfully dainty appearance with ""Don't Leave the Light on Baby"".  Bardo Pond drones like Bardo Pond, or <em>A Thousand Leaves</em>-era Sonic Youth.  Interpol's ""Specialist"" isn't exactly rare, but it's a haunting addition to the second disc.  The New Pornographers' supposedly unreleased pop gem ""Graceland"" is a keeper, too.  And as for the DVD, Malkmus' ""Discretion Grove"" video presents a hilarious portrait of his goofy, ever-ironic persona, while Cornelius once again steals the scene with the mind-blowing, simple ""I Hate Hate"" video.  You'll never need drugs again.</p><p>
    
    Still, the latter discs are really only for total completists.  Disc one is probably only new to the uninitiated, who would be better off starting with the label's mid-1990s catalogue, anyway.  So a single question hangs over the entire compilation: Why?  It's been five years.  'Tis the season.</p></div>"|1928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1928-matador-at-fifteen/|6.5|Marc Hogan

There they are, right in the thick of no-bullshit rock 'n' roll-- <i>fucking noise rock</i>, mang-- bitching about trust and love and What She Did, while all their buddies are breaking dishes during ""13 Monsters"" and sweating in the July heat and Spiewak sweatshirts they all secretly bought off Karmaloop. Today the noise is just too much-- something Beard Guy No. 1 never thought he'd say-- and he takes a taxi back to his parents' house in Greenwich, climbs into his Throbbing Gristle pajamas, and cries cries cries until his hornrims fog up.</p><p>
    
    Even noise guys need break-up albums, records that can pull them out of their funk without making them feel like complete assholes-- and simply put, Death From Above 1979's second album and Vice Records debut, <i>You're a Woman, I'm a Machine</i>, is the answer.  The album title only hints at the viciousness with which this Toronto bass/drums/vox administers its own emotional purge.  The whole affair sounds admittedly far-fetched, especially considering both the band's musical history-- their 2003 debut <i>Heads Up</i> was good and short but merely barked-- and the band's apparent dickheadedness: After Death From Above Records (aka the DFA), approached the band to change its name, the duo responded by tacking on the legal minimum of numbers to their moniker and posting to their former web site: ""FUCK DFA RECORDS FUCK JAMES MURPHY WE DECLARE JIHAD ON THEM HOLY WAR ENDING IN THIER DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT... james murphy is a selfish piece of fuck that will burn in the flames of a specially dedicated rock and roll jihad. if i had the resources i would fly a plane into his skull.""</p><p>
<i>You're a Woman</i> comes as an unexpected and almost regrettable delight in that sense-- it has the attitude, but possibly too much substance, for a true Vice Records release. This is high-gloss, feel-better noise-rock that balances riff-heavy micro-Sabbath bravado with a tenderness quite foreign to the current Providence-born noise scene (of which DFA79 may not be considered to be their contemporaries after <i>You're a Woman</i>). Some might bemoan the album's accessibility, but that's hooks, actual song structure, and broken hearts for you: By turning the rock knob down a notch, DFA79 have kept <i>You're a Woman</i> loud and nasty and ensured a cohesion and unusual degree of listenability-- something that the harder, better, and admittedly more authentic Lightning Bolt still hasn't been able to do in concert or on record.</p><p>
    
    From the livid call-to-arms stomp of ""Turn It Out"" to the scraps and squelches and metalloid pathos of ""Romantic Rights"" to the strangely powerful teenage schlarp-turned-massive Oedipal joke of ""Going Steady"" (""I have never seen you suffer/ I will never hurt you, lover,"" then, ""I will never make you suffer/ I will never hurt you, mother"") to the redrum rant of fiery first-half climax ""Blood on Our Hands"" (""There's blood on the shoes from all the people you stepped on""), DFA79 waste no time on subtlety-- their lyrics and singular jingles are huge but fully exposed and vulnerable as all hell.  Frustration and jealousy increase to painful degrees until the title track's punk chorus (""Now that it's over, I love you more and more""), an avatar of the album's bitterness.</p><p>
    
    This purge over, DFA79 end <i>You're a Machine</i> with two responses to this draining ordeal. The first is the sex-furious, self-explanatory graphic fete ""Pull Out""; the second, ""Sexy Results"", is about getting back to the prowl, and it's the best dance-punk song since the late genre's untimely death earlier this year.  There's the obligatory French introduction, there's cowbell, there's handclaps, and the lyrics put Nic Offer's ""what did George Bush say when he met Tony Blair?"" hook to shame.  And, at the end, a superfunk synth straight outta Chocolate City makes it clear that the DFA79 libido is back.  Will the cycle of <i>You're a Woman</i> repeat itself?  Probably, but for now get out of the corner and just fucking dance.</p></div>"|2587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2587-youre-a-woman-im-a-machine/|8.3|Nick Sylvester

Now on <i>Here Comes Everyone</i>, Aloha make a another shift, curbing their penchant for improvisatory exploration and instead embracing simple rock arrangements and discernible pop hooks. Given Aloha's frequently shifting roster (multi-percussionist T.J. Lipple joined the band in 2003 and helped produce this album) and this series of sonic changes, the only constant in their career is the music press' obsession with the band's vibraphone-- which garners more ink than any individual member of the group.</p><p>
    
    The band's turn to more traditional pop structures may limit its scope but it enhances the immediate power of their songs. Perhaps most notably, it also makes lead vocalist Tony Cavallario a more commanding presence, and he counterbalances his band's more confining compositional model with some of his most evocative vocal melodies and lyrics to date. ""You've Escaped"" is grounded by a simple acoustic guitar progression, with dulcet percussive flourishes and piano figures relegated to a purely textural role. Here, as well as on spare piano-driven ballads such as ""Setting Up Shop"" and ""Perry Como Gold"", Aloha's engine room comes across as a competent but submissive backing band indulging Cavallario's singer/songwriter leanings.</p><p>
    
    Despite the album's often rigid arrangements, most of its songs possess an ephemeral weightlessness. ""Water Your Hands"" combines a swirling melange of marimba, mellotron, and electronic textures with a sublime Sufjan Stevens-esque group chorus, and is one of the album's strongest moments. Cavallario's depiction of life on the road is spot-on: The song's eerie roadside memorials and vacant Roy Rogers rest stops serve as a literal manifestation of the album's general state of limbo. The bright but restrained marimba textures of ""Summer Away"" underscore the song's conflicted nostalgia for the innocence of childhood, while the gentle waltz ""Be Near""-- soaked in ambient synth strings and, yes, vibraphone-- invokes the comforting, grounding familiarity of The Beatles, Beach Boys, and Neil Young while retaining a bittersweet fragility.</p><p>
    
    Aloha's music is more contained than ever before, but their conscious restraint too often stifles the improvisatory energy that has defined their best work. But Aloha's biggest strength is still their tendency toward compositional openness and improvisation, and the album's few concessions to their earlier material tend to overshadow the weaker, more one-dimensional songs cluttered throughout the album. Cale Parks' relentlessly shifting post-rock drumming in ""All the Wars"" is buoyed by a repetitive guitar figure and angelic vocal harmonies, and sprawling closer ""Goodbye to the Factory"" recalls <i>Sugar</i>'s epic scope, concluding the album on an impressive high note.</p></div>"|129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/129-here-comes-everyone/|7.2|David Moore

Formed by erstwhile Beachwood Spark and former member of The Tyde, Brent Rademaker, the Frausdots' debut <i>Couture, Couture, Couture</i> even enlists contributions from one of the era's originals, ex-Psychedelic Furs and current The Cure keyboardist Roger O'Donnell. Opener ""Dead Wrong"" leaps the turnstiles with a frenetic charge unmatched on the rest of the album. Quoting America's AM-gold classic ""A Horse With No Name"", Rademaker refashions the song as glamorous synthpop with a soaring chorus. And when bassist Michelle Loiselle matches her expressive voice with Rademaker's almost blase clean vocals, the song's intrinsic tension could Zippo-light Wembley Stadium and still have enough angst and turmoil left over for Shea.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Frausdots rarely recapture that compulsive drive. ""Fashion Death Trends"" unfolds in a plasticine sheen undercut by tired phrases like, ""I don't feel cool/ Just a little bit cold."" Hung on a tepid guitar and faceless beat, there's nothing to distract you from their forgettable lyrics. ""Soft Light"" attempts the anthemism of ""Dead Wrong"" but it's more soft-rock foppery than potent morning-starter. Rademaker uses his stylistic staples-- a buzzing synth and twilit bass-- and the track meanders for more refrains than it can sustain.</p><p>
    
    Unsurprisingly, Rademaker makes his mark when he forsakes goth-rock and embraces his jangle-pop roots. ""The Extremists"" bounces on a rollicking bass line and steaming guitars, cramming a little light into the album's dense, wintry textures. The country-twanged guitar solo and glaring organ fills are both jolting and highlight Rademaker's forceful voice. For the first time, he seems to find his place amidst the bleak rhythms. It's as if he's returned to his comfort zone.</p><p>
    
    Similarly, ""Current Bedding"" also plays to Rademaker's strengths by using synths as accoutrements instead of bedrock and focusing on warm, billowing melodies and first-dance sentimentality. As it does on ""The Extremists"", the shift from the blood-drained sounds of the Thatcher-era UK to subtle organ lines and steady beats augments Rademaker's voice. He's less Bono and more Paul Westerberg-- and for he and the Frausdots, it's a better fit.</p></div>"|3326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3326-couture-couture-couture/|6.7|Derek Miller

They played throughout the Pacific Northwest, opening for venerable bands such as The Flaming Lips, Built to Spill, and Mouse on Mars.  Besides an acclaimed debut on K records, <em>Chotto Matte a Moment!</em>, they had a great live show going for them-- a stand-up acoustic bassist, a computer music student jamming on her analog synths, and (their secret weapon) a theremin player who could do more than make good-looking noise. The band was riding high on their cerebrum-to-booty connection, getting cross-armed audiences across the land to bob their heads, and many considered them poised for an aural coup of the underground electronic scene.  But after a few remixes and EPs in the year 2000, they went silent.</p><p>  Four years later, they've returned minus the bass and on a new label, with the album <em>Sun Q</em>.  Official reasons for the long break include independent projects and reconceptualizing their sound, but <em>Sun Q</em> seems as though bandmates K.O. and Michiko Swiggs have simply been waiting in suspended animation.  Make no mistake-- Iqu's sound is highly transformed, turning up the sequenced DIY disco and leaving behind most of the experimental sampling.  But <em>Sun Q</em> heavily traverses the landscapes of late 90s Japanese-influenced electronic pop-- the Tokyo-overdrive of Cornelius' <em>Fantasma</em> or the sugary funk of Cibo Matto's <em>Stereotype A</em>.  It sounds of the years just prior to the omnipresence of laptop performers and glitchy breaks, when drum tones still had a bass-end and electronics could be as much toys as instruments.  The album's lightness is refreshing in a musical sphere that has, across the board, come to take itself far too seriously; when it gets overly cutesy, however, it becomes easily dismissible as derivative.</p><p>  It feels odd to dub an album hearkening back just half-a-decade ""dated,"" but <em>Sun Q</em>'s combination of turntable scratches, vocoders, and bubbly vibe would have held more appeal a few years ago.  The album is a mash of styles that can be generally categorized as ""alien pop""-- mutated top 40, broken disco, and hyperactive glam instrumentals that flow along at a stream-of-consciousness pace.  It's most successful and original on its theremin-centered pieces, such as the catchy, warm opener ""Under the Cherry Blossom"".  K.O.'s masterful hand-waving reappears throughout-- notably on an excellent, hilariously long-winded instrumental cover of Minnie Riperton's ""Lovin' You"".  The album's title track is a duet over some Pizzicato Five smoothness, and the rest of the vocal-driven songs are hooked upon deep, syncopated moog basslines that maintain a positive if sometimes cloying ass-shaking vibe.</p><p>  Layers of embedded surprises make <em>Sun Q</em> worth a close listen; ultimately, however, its ceaseless pulse, quick stylistic changes, and production are aiming at a very certain sort of party in a box-- a balance of funky and cute.  It's a well-constructed album, but it does feel made for a party that happened a few years ago.  Still, this duo's got the skillz and the visionz, and in case you hadn't heard, everyone digs thereminz.  Hopefully, it won't be another four years before they're heard from again.</p><p> </p></div>"|4050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4050-sun-q/|7.6|Liam Singer

Matt Sharp's solo debut is the product of four years held up in Leiper's Fork, TN, wrestling with his demons. Sure, the Son of Man's personal demon happened to be, well, the devil. But Sharp was battling Andy Warhol and 15 rapidly receding minutes of fame. Jesus went back to Galilee and was glorified by all. Sharp recorded 11 songs of desolation and loneliness, as demanding as they are sparse-- and, ultimately, as uneven.</p><p>
    
    Has it been just 10 years since we came undone for <i>The Blue Album</i>? Sharp played bass on that record, of course, Weezer's first, before leading quirky new-wave side project The Rentals to a bona fide hit, ""Friends of P"". After <em>Pinkerton</em>-- do I really need to mention that this was Weezer's then-overlooked sophomore outing?-- Sharp left (or was fired; details are disputed) and became a Rental full time. If a 2002 lawsuit is to be believed, Sharp co-wrote some of Weezer's best songs. But Sharp's first less-than-brilliant release, The Rentals' <em>Seven More Minutes</em>, is probably the last time most listeners heard anything him.</p><p>
    
    The first hints of Sharp's transmogrification from Coke-rimmed uber-geek to whiskey-soaked, lap steel-slinging lost cause came on last year's <em>Puckett's Versus the Country Boy</em> EP. The disc traded alt-rock for the more downcast moments from <em>Blonde on Blonde</em>; instead of ""Visions of Johanna"", Sharp gives us melancholy ""Visions of Anna"". Hmm. That disc's most memorable track, ""Goodbye West Coast"", is the only one to reappear on his self-titled full-length, and its plodding acoustic kiss-off to L.A. lifestyles really isn't as different from Phantom Planet's ""California"" as it would like to be.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Sharp follows the example of Talk Talk's Mark Hollis, another erstwhile new waver who made an inscrutably soft, spacious solo debut. Elegiac closer ""Some Days"" makes use of silence and the frailties of the human voice almost as well as Hollis, while also getting off the record's best lyric: ""Some days you wanna get married/ And some days you're drunk."" An instrumental, ""Shadows"", engages in the type of ambient noise Hollis borrowed from Brian Eno.</p><p>
    
    The album's crowning achievement is ""Just Like Movie Stars"", which has been justly compared to Nick Drake. A better modern analogue is M. Ward, whose voice Sharp's resembles here and who layers these sorts of intricate, aching folk guitar figures as well as anyone since John Fahey. The words are appropriately cryptic, saying good night to Hollywood Blvd. far better than ""Goodbye West Coast"" as Sharp zooms in on a picturesque romance with the cinematic vision of classic noir. ""Bells ring out from ice cream cars,"" he offers, going on to name-drop World War II-era Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr. It's brilliant, and it's a shame the rest of the album can't keep up.</p><p>
    
    Weezer fans hoping for a sea change to rival, uh, Beck's <em>Sea Change</em> will inevitably be disappointed. Though <em>Matt Sharp</em>'s finest moments are well worth the time it takes to appreciate them, they're exceptions, not the rule. ""Let Me Pass"" pairs rhyming-dictionary doggerel with a ""The Ballad of John &amp; Yoko"" melody on Quaaludes. Try the deliberate textures of ""After the Angels"" or ""Watch the Weather Break"" instead of NyQuil. Then again, there's always the gorgeously funereal call and response of ""Before You Go"", building a mausoleum out of ghostly harmonies and subtle piano. ""Kiss everyone you love, everyone you know,"" goes the coda.</p><p>
    
    The introspective return of this former Rental is flawed as a whole, but the best two or three songs deserve the attention of anyone who finds as much beauty in the silences between painstakingly bent acoustic guitar notes as in irrepressible Moog hooks.</p></div>"|7708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7708-matt-sharp/|6.3|Marc Hogan

Kelly don't like each other.  They've been canceling dates on their co-headlining tour, and the rumors are flying.  Kelly     doesn't like that Jay got a better reception at the tour's opening show in Chicago.  Jay doesn't like that Kelly simulates sex with two     women in a cage/jail cell as part of his act.  When they're onstage together, they barely look at each other.</p>
<p>So why did they make another album together?  It could be for money, but neither of these guys is going digging for change anytime soon.     It's not for artistic reasons; both are firmly on autopilot here.  So it would seem, then, that their reasons are entirely egotistical.     In March 2002, the pair released <i>The Best of Both Worlds</i>, a collaborative album hyped as a blockbuster union of the two     brightest stars in R&amp;B; and hip-hop.  But within a few weeks of the album's release, a bootleg video of Kelly allegedly having really,     really nasty sex with an underage girl surfaced.  Radio stayed off the album like it was infected, and the artists never even bothered     to make a video.  As a result, the album was a relative flop, failing to sell even one million copies.  Neither artist could cope with     that sort of blot on their resumes, so now we get <i>Unfinished Business</i>.  ""In the first week, I predict a million sold,"" posits     Kelly on ""Big Chips"".</p>
<p><i>Unfinished Business</i> is a decidedly minor work from both artists; neither strays from his comfort zone.  Jay doesn't indulge in     any of <i>The Black Album</i>'s bittersweet introspection, and Kelly almost doesn't mention Jesus.  Instead, they're both in full     VIP-section pimp glide, leaning hard, stepping past bouncers, blowing cigar smoke with a girl on each arm and donning immaculately     perfect white suits.  They're all smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>Most of the album's beats are reworkings of <i>Best of Both Worlds</i> tracks, and they sound oddly dated.  Like <i>Both Worlds</i>,     the entire album was produced by the Trackmasters, a Neptunes-lite duo who peaked around 2001 and who haven't been finding a lot of     work since.  Their sound-- flanged acoustic guitars, jazz-funk piano plinks, rippling clicks-- is so clean you could eat off it.  It's     the sound of richer, happier times.  Sometimes it's effective; they deploy burbling synthesized flamenco guitars on ""Mo' Money"" and a     bazonkers gospel choir on ""Don't Let Me Die"" to great effect.  But they also deliver ""Feelin' You in Stereo"" and ""Break Up (That's All     We Do)"", some weak-ass bourgie mid-90s slow jam shit.  And in 2004, Jay-Z has no business rapping on a track that could've been a     City High remix three years ago.</p>
<p>So, then, is Jay still retired or what?  He knows you're thinking it: ""Y'all nervous/ I ain't back yet/ I'm on extended vaca/ I ain't     unpacked yet,"" he says on ""Stop"".  It's a point he makes very clearly over the course of this record; he's not truly present here,     and rarely contributes more than a cameo.  This is primarily Kelly's album, and he plays it to the hilt-- all effortless, honey-dripping     purr.  Sometimes he's Nate Dogg-level lazy, but that falsetto is powerful enough to have put some of the most shocking allegations in     R&amp;B;'s storied history a mere footnote to his career.  And!  He raps!  Kelly makes a surprisingly spry emcee, dropping lines in a crisp,     lilting, fussy sing-song cadence that bites Slick Rick so hard you almost don't notice when the <i>real</i> Slick Rick shows up at the     end of the album.  On ""Mo' Money"", Kelly follows a typically dazzling jackhammer Twista cameo with his own take on Midwest speed-rap,     acquitting himself so impressively that Jay has to pull out some weird, breathless, gasping flow shit to top him.</p>
<p>For his part, Jay pretty much sticks with tossed-off playa-isms about whips and jewels and getting this paper.  We've heard it before,     but he still does it better than anyone else, rolling syllables around for entire verses just for fun. You can hear the joy in his     voice when he drops bon mots like, ""Take a photo/ Last time you see a nigga so cold/ So below zero, so froze/ So-so rappers are so     sore in the soul/ Ain't my fault I'm so rock 'n' roll,"" on ""We Got 'Em Goin'"".</p>
<p><i>Unfinished Business</i> is a light, breezy listen, and surprisingly solid for an album with no real reason to exist from two guys     who can't stand each other.  But of course, Jay and Kelly are masters of effortlessness-- they can make music in their sleep, and here,     that's pretty much what they've done.</p></div>"|4220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4220-unfinished-business-with-r-kelly/|6.7|Tom Breihan

After explaining
    why I thought pop and politics almost never mix well, she wondered if there were any recent pol-pop releases that I considered successful.
    The best I could come up with was Dr. Ring-Ding's ""Bombs Over Baghdad"", and then I did my best to offer the reporter a Jamaican dancehall
    primer.  I later wished I'd mentioned dj/Rupture-- although that would've taken even more explanation.</p><p>
    
    The probable reason that Rupture had slipped my mind is also why his politically tinged tracks are successful-- because with rare
    exceptions they aren't <i>overtly</i> political.  And unlike most music with a conscience, they aren't ephemeral, sanctimonious,
    or dry, either.  In most cases, even though Rupture's multicultural ""ghetto-to-ghetto"" approach is infused with a love for and
    curiosity of a wide range of musical and cultural traditions, it's not necessary to catch the geopolitical undertones.</p><p>
    
    Rupture first came to relative prominence in 2002 with a pair of dense, glove-straddling mixes-- the previously download-only <i>Gold
    Teeth Thief</i>, and <i>Minesweeper Suite</i>-- and delivered a third, the split release (with Mutamassik) <i>Shotgun Wedding Vol. 1:
    The Bidoun Sessions</i> earlier this year.  Those three mixes were audacious, eye- and ear-opening melanges of hip-hop, drum-n-bass,
    dancehall, North African and Arabic folk music, and splatter beats.  Rupture connected the sounds of struggle and a yearning for
    respect on multiple continents, unifying folk traditions even when he was breaking apart sound. </p><p>
    
    On <i>Special Gunpowder</i>, dj/Rupture retains the spirit of his mixes but tosses out the process.  Instead of mixing and assembling
    the sonics himself, Rupture's LP features Western and Arabic musicians, as well as tracks sung in English, French, and Spanish, and
    guest spots by artists ranging from producers Kit Clayton and Kid606 to dancehall veterans Sister Nancy and Junior Cat to Arnaud
    Michniak of French band Programme.  Depending on where the needle hits the groove, Rupture's music also features a poet, a member of
    avant-metal group Oxbow, a violin and oud player, and a banjoist who sings an adaptation of the traditional American folk song ""Mole
    in the Ground"".  Trying to replicate the scope and power of those mixes with the limitations of live musicians was always going to be
    a tricky and potentially messy proposition, but Rupture has gone some distance towards pulling it off because he knows when to pull
    his punches.</p><p>
    
    Sonically, <i>Special Gunpowder</i> is a surprisingly light affair.  After trudging through the opening track, a performance of an
    Elizabeth Alexander poem, the next sound is a dead ringer for the Fiesta riddim.  With Clayton and Kid606 helping to orchestrate a
    loping palette for Sister Nancy and a melodica to paint, the track harkens back to light, newly synthesized dancehall of the 1980s,
    a tone shared with some of the album's more Old World sounds, but not all of the other dancehall tracks.  Both ""Flop We"" featuring
    Junior Cat and ""No Heathen"" with Wicked Act are nocturnal and steely, but no worse off for it.</p><p>
    
    Either of those tracks could have slid onto <i>Minesweeper Suite</i>, but for the most part, where Rupture used to obscure or bury a
    central melody or a groove-- and make you dig through sonic sludge to get at it-- <i>Gunpowder's session players do the heavy
    lifting for you, creating a more accessible if slightly less engaging atmosphere.  A Wayne Lonesome collabo ""Dem Nu Know"" comes
    courtesy of Shockout Records and the spirit of King Jammy; Lily's dusky exotica-folk vocals redresses Cocoa Tea's ""Lonesome Side""
    in the Peanie Peanie riddim.  Excursions into glitch-infused French hip-hop and a club remix of the Latin-tinged, Spanish-sung
    ""Musquito"" are also highlights.</i></p><p>
<i>Special Gunpowder</i> may disappoint a lot of Rupture's fans, those hoping for something from the producer's first artist album
    that matches the tone, tenor, and pace of his mixes, but it's an unfair criticism.  The methods are different, and even though the
    madness is now replaced by an increase in melody, and the pieces no longer fit into a cogent whole, there are still plenty of reasons
    to embrace the LP.  If anything-- considering the variety on the record-- there could be too many for some listeners.  As Jace Clayton's
    <i>nom de producer</i> suggests, he deconstructs music, but rather than leave his toys scattered and in pieces, Rupture re-assembles
    them in frequently thrilling ways.</p></div>"|2586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2586-special-gunpowder/|7.7|Scott Plagenhoef

    If that record sowed any suspicion that The Court &amp; Spark were drifting away from their alt-country roots and into more exploratory
    territory, those notions are quickly dispelled by ""Suffolk Down Upon the Night"", the opening cut on the band's new LP, <i>Witch
    Season</i>. In one fell swoop, The Court &amp; Spark reconcile their latent experimental tendencies and penchant for downy textures with
    their ever-winsome country-pop roots. The track's pedal steel inflections are a nice textural element. The track also highlights,
    better than anything the band have done, the skill and finesse of their arrangements, owing more aesthetically to orchestral pop
    than stripped-down country.</p><p>
    
    ""Out on the Water"" is a slow-burning, late-afternoon jam overflowing with organ drones and gilt trumpet accompaniment.  It would be
    difficult to believe it's The Court &amp; Spark playing were it not for M.C. Taylor's reliably tender vocals, at once blithe and melancholic.
    Taylor is a remarkably casual vocalist, effortlessly delivering his supple melodies rather than over-singing or trying to add gravity
    through feigned affliction or other contrivances. His band is a perfect accompaniment: musicians who answer subtlety with even more
    subtlety.</p><p>
    
    These songs don't deviate from The Court &amp; Spark's previous approach as much as show an increased stylistic breadth. ""Denver Annie""
    and ""Hallelujah I""-- with their meaty arrangements and strong melodies-- emphasize the ""pop"" in country-pop.  The requisite tearjerkers
    are here, too: ""Steeplechasing"" opens with a huge, plodding bass drum beat before evolving into a somber piano ballad that actually
    <em>grooves</em>. ""Swimmingly Endless"" is similarly downcast, though hardly despondent. Even on their gloomiest numbers, The Court &amp;
    Spark crack the door wide enough for the refulgent light of their charming melodies to pour inside.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, many of the tracks dissolve into one another, blending into a mix of nondescript acoustic guitar melodies.  At times,
    <i>Witch Season</i> is so sanded-down it could soundtrack a new season of ""This Old House""; absent is the type of emotional impact
    they left on the expressive <i>Bless You</i> centerpiece ""National Lights"".  But fans of that album won't be disappointed after the
    lengthy wait for <i>Witch Season</i>, which picks up where The Court &amp; Spark left off three years ago-- making emotive, imagistic
    music.</p></div>"|1637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1637-witch-season/|7.8|Sam Ubl

Such folks make their names by either subverting with room-clearing studio productions or make asses outta themselves for passersby to throw nickels in their hats. Given their album title, <i>Nothing Is Cool</i>, guess what classifies our brothers from Vancouver, McEnroe and Birdapres? On the record jacket, they sit on a bench with bored faces. Birdapres asks, ""Hey, what's cool?"" A pause. McEnroe's reply: ""Nothing."" The end. That old bit about hopeless cynics still evokes a chuckle ever since it debuted on a skateboard 15 years ago. It works for these gentlemen as well. Given that bulletproof irony is now obsolete, their verses must be judged as pure sincerity.</p><p>
    McEnroe and Birdapres are underground MCs who seemingly spent too many long nights waiting for their turns at 20-man concert bills, performing for half-asleep audiences and then adding up every measly dollar they earned to cover gas. They paid their dues and now believe that everyone owes them. ""Holler if you hear me/ Hear me if you hollerÉnone of us will ever appear at the Apollo,"" mopes Birdapres in the zinger, ""Grumpy Old Men"".</p><p>
    Their loser-rap can be charming-- ""Grumpy Old Man""'s crocodile tear-jerking piano melody fits when the guys kick dirt over high school bullies becoming B-boys and gym teachers trying to impress the kids by rapping. But on album closer ""F*@K You 2K3"", when they tell 95% of the world to screw themselves, including carbohydrates and aspiring MCs who email them lyrics, they are nothing more than sour grapes who deserve audience indifference during their shows. ""Fuck rap music in general,"" carps Birdapres. Indeed. The title track joins the indie rap tradition of complaining about the Phonies in bling-bling. Their horrorshow of the industry's decadence is as old as Ice-T's ""don't you be like me"" after-school lectures about the penthouses, harems, and semi-automatics he never really owned. Plus, if you're going to rap about devils in three-piece suits jacking you over, either make your audience smile (""If you take a shit, they want to know,""-- A Tribe Called Quest's ""Show Business"") or make then nod along with downcast eyes (Blackalicious's ""Shallow Days""). Just don't rub your face against the window of a rich rapper's soiree, (""Martinis and cigars, does anybody give a fuck who we are?"" quote Birdapres). McEnroe later shouts, ""People think I'm an independent and I don't want money/ But I want a fist-full!"" </p><p>
    When they're not throwing rocks, McEnroe and Birdapres don't have much to prove besides sampling a few good records. Oh, they brag about their frickin' cool soundsystem (""5000 Watts""), drink cheap beer over credit card debt (""Broke Beat""), or fantasize about mafias that Hollywood sold them (""Family Business""). But their production is <i>Nothing</i>'s saving grace. Every break flows with the rhyming, whether they are Mexican soap opera orchestras or front-porch guitar riffs. Our dear brothers even know it; their chorus on the crate-digging ode, ""Break Merchant"" is ""No, you can't sample this break!"" </p><p>
    Their rhyme skills aren't bad either, as McEnroe reminds us, ""Fuck the critics who say I can't rap in the first place/ That's absurd in the worse way."" They also have the right voices: McEnroe's tone resembles an EL-P bickering over the TV news, while the nimble Birdapres sounds akin to Lyrics Born after five shots of NyQuil. But it's their choices from the King's English that sinks them. They diss ""The Worst Person"", an anonymous sonofabitch who picks his nose, hogs the basketball, and ""asks too many questions and doesn't wait for answers."" And by the way, ""Of course he smokes, because he's, like, the worst person."" </p></div>"|5612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5612-nothing-is-cool/|5.1|Cameron Macdonald

    and McCormick</i>.  For an all-too-brief moment in the early 1980s, network television seemed to cater almost exclusively to boys aged
    7-15.  I was lucky to be a member of this elite class, amongst the target demo of these kid-tested/mother-denied telecasts.  But for
    all the hours I spent admiring Lee Majors' proto-<i>MacGyver</i> ingenuity and B.A. Baracus' oppressive unsilliness, I have no distinct
    visual memories of these shows; just a vague montage of military-grade explosives, dirt mounds, and white limousines.</p><p>
    
    The only thing I remember with any clarity at all is the music-- those awesome, supercharged theme songs that outblasted any onscreen
    artillery and promised more stunt-powered glory than Evel Knievel's Snake River Canyon jump.  And most of them were written by one
    man: the cruelly unsung Mike Post, stateside television's own Ennio Morricone.  The breadth of Post's stylistic range and uncanny
    knack for visceral impact have made him one of very few television composers worth remembering, and I guarantee you know more of his
    work than you think.</p><p>
    
    I can't pretend to know which brilliantly Post-themed programs were broadcast in the UK (although many were), but six-strong
    Brighton brigade The Go! Team are clearly just as familiar with his work as any American my age.  Their debut album, <i>Thunder,
    Lightning, Strike</i>, is a hazy blend of nostalgia, evoking that period through a melange of action hero theme songs, early hip-hop
    (from 1979-82, in particular), and traces of 70s sunshine funk.</p><p>
    
    In a contemporary context, The Go! Team-- not to be confused with Calvin Johnson's highly inferior 1980s collective of the same name--
    could be shelved alongside The Avalanches and Rjd2, as all three share a party aesthetic whose reflection of bygone eras is just
    slightly wistful.  But one immediately striking difference between them is The Go! Team's reliance on live instrumentation.  Though
    they certainly do their fair share of sampling, they tend to use fragments as a means of fleshing out the battling, overdriven guitars,
    triumphant trumpet lines, and drum assaults that seem to break through walls with the barreling force of a thousand Kool-Aid men.</p><p>
<i>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</i>'s opener, ""Panther Dash"", wastes no time establishing the band's modus operandi: Its ""Hawaii Five-O""
    crash-in mates with an open-range harmonica to evoke some lost Sergio Leone-directed ""Speed Racer"" showdown.  ""The Power Is On"" pops
    like puffy rainbow stickers, rubbing determined piano chords against surly trumpets and cheerleader chants.  ""Junior Kickstart"" is BMX
    banditos navigating mud-caked spokes and handlebars through flagged-off terrain.  ""Bottle Rocket"" throws back to Saturday morning
    cartoons and Brooklyn b-girl breakdowns, with female rapper Ninja lunging from dusk-cast shadows to conjure a katana-wielding Sha Rock.</p><p>
    
    This record recalls, with striking exactness, a very specific time and place that The Go! Team could only have experienced second-hand,
    through imported television and culture.  But then, it was vicarious for us all: <i>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</i> aspires to recapture
    the imaginary good-natured competitiveness of a period before realism dominated prime-time TV, when cars and helicopters could talk, and
    good guys always wore pleather.  It's all dusky reds and yellows, shag-headed battle royales, exploding tanks, and getting up the next
    day to relive it on the playground.</p></div>"|3654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3654-thunder-lightning-strike/|8.7|Ryan Schreiber

    spotty but sporadically thrilling <i>Tomorrow Right Now</i>.  Pairing an adoration of classic Warp Records IDM with his rapid rambling,
    the record made cold fusion of party music-- its alien synth flourishes flawlessly fused with micro-crisp glitch-beats.  A few short
    months later, he'd returned: <i>Now, Soon, Someday</i> was an instantly acclaimed (and very cred-securing) mini LP that showed Beans
    honing his mix of computerized froth and rabid flow, culminating in the mesmerizing electro-grooves of ""Structure Tone"", ""Win or Lose
    You Lose"", and the Bambaataa-esque headfuck ""Gold Skull"".  Oh yeah, it also featured contributions from El-P and Prefuse 73.</p><p>
<i>Shock City Maverick</i>, unfortunately, fails to carry <i>Now</i>'s momentum.  Instead, the new full-length is yet another
    wait-and-see moment.  <i>Maverick</i> has a more consistent tone than either of Beans' previous records, but it also lacks the
    stand-outs of its predecessors, settling into bland production strokes that recede behind his always fascinating rhymes.  On
    highlights like ""Papercut"", Beans augments his verbal barrage with steel-tight wirescapes.  Against frigid electronics and a
    shiv-sharp beat, he slathers wicked absurdities like, ""Never let a woman plant a flag on my testicles/ Love to fuck but don't fuck
    around.""  It's a moment of hope and crooked angularity, laying down a Run-DMC-on-ice cityscape that's shouting for Saturday nights
    and midnight jailbaiting.  Coming after the scrambled intro ""Light of the Damned"", the song's insurgency could lead you to believe--
    if only momentarily-- that Beans had reached his promise.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, Beans safeguards his most inspired production for his instrumental tracks.  ""You're Dead Let's Disco"" opens with wavering church
    bells and jangled chimes, the sound of robotic prayers and mechanized piety.  As its reverberating beat chips away at the solemn backdrop,
    he jams dense synth noises and robotic whinnying into the mix-- it's Kanye West breast-fed on Hugo and Dumas.  But the track still seems
    embryonic.  If Beans had flooded his chatterboxed rhymes atop the track, it might have been the focal point the album lacks.</p><p>
    
    ""A Force on Edge"", the second of the album's instrumentals, stumbles on broken cello strokes and static tangles.  While the beat gets
    to its feet and slowly takes the song by the throat, the cellos mount an ethereal junkyard grind, and yet again, Beans' most quietly
    inspired chaos is left without the grip of his rhymes.  ""Death by Sophistication"", too, chokes on a dull amorphous beat, its most
    unforgivable moment coming with Beans' unpleasant refrain, ""Crowd screaming like a dick caught in a zipper.""  ""I'll Melt You"" exposes
    more of Beans' atypically over-arched lyricism.  As its limp vintage-Warp backdrop steadies the bottom, rhymes like, ""If Reese's Pieces
    increases your feces/ Whyn't get funky?"" and, ""Greedy with girls/ Half-naked in a tickle-fight/ Stroking my ego like a handjob,"" stick
    to the mic with cheap, sophomoric glee.  The absurdity of such boasts and crude one-offs against the geek-star groove of his academic
    production is laughable, like a calc-whiz bragging about loosely imagined trysts to math-club cronies.</p><p>
    
    Beans always had a tendency to reach hard for coffee-shop poesie, but his brash schoolboy taunts sink past angstful overextension.
    Considering the regression in his production on <i>Shock City Maverick</i>, it's getting harder to imagine Beans ever living up to
    his Antipop potential.  Pull out <i>Arrhythmia</i> again, and sigh along to what might have been.</p></div>"|604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/604-shock-city-maverick/|6.8|Derek Miller

SCG's extensive travels, both temporal and otherwise, have enabled Bishop to cast his net globally to incorporate numberless strains of Middle Eastern, Pan-Asian, and North African flavors into his distinctive instrumental style.</p><p>
    
    In 1998, Bishop released his first solo album-- the exquisite <i>Salvador Kali</i>-- on John Fahey's Revenant label. Containing pieces for solo guitar and piano, the album revealed a delicate lyricism not always evident on themore savage and protean SCG releases such as <i>Valentines from Matahari</i>. Last year, Bishop followed up <i>Kali</i> with a lengthy contribution to Locust's Wooden Guitar collection, which also featured pieces from the kindred guitar spirits of Steffen Basho-Junghans, Jack Rose, and Tetuzi Akiyama. This compilation worked so well that apparently Locust now intends the Wooden Guitar series to be ongoing, and <i>Improvika</i> is the first step on that voyage.</p><p>
<i>Improvika</i> features an unaccompanied Bishop on a steel-string wooden guitar, and as its title implies his playing here sounds considerably more extemporaneous and free-flowing than on the more composed, stately <i>Salvador Kali</i>. Each of these nine songs is easily digestible portion, with track lengths in the three- to eight-minute range. </p><p>
    
    The sonic disembarkation point of Bishop's solo work lands him somewhere in the fertile geography between the Eastern mysticism of Robbie Basho and the freewheeling gypsy jazz of Django Reinhardt. But his influences are too obscure and far-reaching to constrain him to even that immense landscape (perhaps his work is best classified as one song title here appropriately puts it: ""Provenance Unknown""), and on <i>Improvika</i> he explores and links a worldwide series of underground caverns and alleyways.  One minute, the bewitching, multi-colored scarves of ""Rudra's Feast"" dance and swirl before your eyes, and the next things segue abruptly into the percussive, Derek Bailey-like dissonance of ""Cryptonymus"". The Spanish-flavored ""Rose Secretions"" sounds like the priest preparing his vestments before praying above a fallen toreador, while the stormy chords that cap ""Skull of Sidon"" seem to signal mysterious ceremonies of a much darker order.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album, Bishop displays a virtuosity that borders on the flabbergasting. On high-wired tracks like ""Jaisalmer"" it sounds as though he leaves no portion of the fretboard untouched, and he moves with such frantic dexterity that it's difficult to imagine someone's mind operating that quickly, let alone their fingers. Rather than mere technical proficiency, however, it's Bishop's uncanny ability to translate and synthesize the many and varied tongues of his antecedents that makes <i>Improvika</i> so intoxicating.</p></div>"|1139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1139-improvika/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

Unlike some of her less earthbound contemporaries, Doiron is wholly disinterested in investigating either music's history or its future.  Rather, her songs seem solely concerned with capturing the present-- the moment of their conception-- as accurately as possible.</p><p>
    
    Last year, Jagjaguwar reissued 1996's <i>Broken Girl</i>, Doiron's first solo recording after the break up of her group Eric's Trip, and the difference between those early works and <i>Goodnight Nobody</i> is jarring. The skeletal songs on <i>Broken Girl</i> felt at times unfinished, her guitar playing was hesitant, and she sang as if worried about waking the cat. Here, her vocals are nuanced and confident, and with the help of such collaborators as Eric Trip's Rick White and Wooden Stars' Dave Draves, each song on <i>Goodnight Nobody</i> is sent into the world fully dressed and neatly groomed.</p><p>
    
    Throughout her career, Doiron has followed the cliched ""write what you know"" maxim to a fault, and that doesn't change here; there's very little mystery within the plainspoken lyrics of tracks like ""Snowfalls in November"" or ""Last Night"".  When Doiron sings lines like, ""Tomorrow I will be on a stage/ And I will sing the words from all of the pages/ In front of all the people/ I will close my eyes thinking of you,"" she certainly gives you no reason not to believe her.  (And when she titles a song ""Banjo"" you can be damn sure it'll indeed have a banjo on it.)  Although this offhanded, honest approach does cause the album to lack an element of surprise, <i>Goodnight Nobody</i> makes up for it with its genuine air of emotional intimacy. </p><p>
    
    As is often the case with confessional songwriting, this charged intimacy leads Doiron into areas of emotional longing and melancholy. Fortunately, her songs are each so melodically engaging and deftly arranged that tracks like ""The Songwriter"" are able to delve into heavier emotive terrain without ever becoming oppressively self-indulgent. The instrumentation is kept loose and lean throughout, giving the album a dissipated electric folk-rock sound not dissimilar to Galaxie 500 or Cat Power. Piano, banjo, vibraphone, and restrained sampling all make strategic cameos on the occasions when Doiron's voice and guitar need some subtle embellishment. </p><p>
    
    Though her limited vocal range may prove to be a stumbling block for some, I find Dorion's imaginative phrasing compensates for her voice's imperfections.  And indeed, <i>Goodnight Nobody</i> finds Doiron making the best use yet of her natural tools.  Ever so quietly, she continues to cut a unique and noteworthy path through the indie rock underbrush.</p></div>"|2409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2409-goodnight-nobody/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

Eventually, I found a copy of <i>Stick Around for Joy</i> at my local library, and about halfway through the first song, I was wrapped up in Björk's wild croon and the band's general pop acumen. I'd forgotten all about the warnings... until Einar came out swinging with doofus chants and the whole song went to hell.  I imagined I'd be able to get through it if he didn't crop up on every song.  The problem is that he does, and he ruins an otherwise fantastic band in the process.  The point being: If you have one amazing vocalist, why allow anyone else to compromise it?</p><p>
    This is a question D.C.'s Black Eyes should probably address; they've got their very own Einar.  And even in light of their deconstructionist, anarchic approach, I can't see why the rest of the Black Eyes let him open his mouth.  I would give the guy's name, but frankly I don't know it: Black Eyes are one of those uber-democratic bands that operate on a first-name basis only with no instrument credits in the liners.  Rather, they let their two drummers/two bassists/sax/guitar/vocals/etc. lineup speak for itself as one, which allows this guy and his extremely unpleasant, wavering caterwaul to hide behind relative anonimity.  At least he has the decency not to show up until the fourth track.</p><p>
    Now, when you play in a band whose most obvious influences are D.C. post-hardcore and free jazz progressive noise like This Heat (and punks might not like to admit this, but that sax style was first developed in bands like King Crimson, Plastic People of the Universe, and Van Der Graaf Generator), it's difficult to make yourself into such a sore thumb that you ruin the chaos, yet somehow, this singer manages to do just that.  And the real tragedy is that his is the only attribute on the whole record that doesn't work-- the band's principle vocalist has one of those classic Dischord voices that's a little shredded when it needs to be, but is mostly solid and forceful, a commanding baritone/tenor that he can put to a melody or rapid-fire sing-speak with equal facility.  So there's really no need for the other guy in the first place.  Plus, the guitars and saxes do plenty of listenable shrieking as it is-- Black Eyes are a confrontational band and their potent blasts of funky Ornette Coleman punk and no-wave sheets of feedback are visceral and gripping.  </p><p>
    The band's <i>good</i> vocalist holds up his end admirably, although his words typically fly by in a hyperkinetic blur, and his performance on ""Drums""-- the record's third and best track-- is absolutely insane.  He's talking more quickly than most people can think here, and the band's sick, brutal cacophony coalesces into a serrated blade that cuts a thousand ways-- from the funky bassline that kicks in around 1:15 to the nasty, dryly recorded sax that flays the groove from front to back and the blanket of guitar feedback that hangs low in the mix.  Even the songs with that other vocalist, the powerful whorl of percussion and frequent dub inflections (especially on ""Scrapes &amp; Scratches"") is enough to overwhelm the band's one shortcoming.</p><p>
    That Black Eyes manage to create gripping music in spite of a conspicuous flaw speaks volumes about their improvisatory elan and collective skill as musicians.  And from a philosophical standpoint, it seems clear that they don't give a crap whether something in their sound is likely to grate as long as it satisfies the band's internal demands and conceptual ends.  As a result, <i>Cough</i> is one of those records that demands discipline to absorb, but will eventually reward those who stick around.</p></div>"|758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/758-cough/|6.9|Joe Tangari

    Stockton, California.  ""I was backstage before the show and all those guys, they looked so scary, I was afraid of them,"" Malkmus told
    writer Jason Fine.  ""Like, Greg Ginn was mixing up this stuff in a glass.  It was probably just protein powder or some healthy drink,
    but I thought it was heroin or something.""  Observing Henry Rollins squeezing a cue ball to pump himself up, Malkmus compared the
    Sisyphean ritual to smashing your head against a brick wall.  ""That's what I thought punk was, you know.  That's when I knew that
    maybe I'm just not punk enough.""</p><p>
    
    No maybes about it.  The late-1993 press photos that accompany the lavish 62-page booklet included with this heavily augmented 2xCD
    reissue of <i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i> tell the story.  After original drummer Gary Young split earlier in the year and Steve
    West, Bob Nastanovich and Mark Ibold joined Malkmus and Scott Kannberg, Pavement looked like a scrubbed-up gang of packaging majors
    in search of a good tailgate party (jolly Nastanovich in U-Mass windbreaker, clean-cut S.M. in puffy red ski jacket; only West's Harry
    Carey-style specs suggest that these guys might be hanging with New York hipsters).</p><p>
    
    The dorkily collegiate look was of no concern to Pavement, because to them, appearances never mattered.  That's what all the indie bands
    said back then, of course, even the ones who threw away the twin-blade, let their jeans wear through the knees, flew the flannel, and
    became world famous.  But from the first <i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i> single (""Cut Your Hair"") forward, Pavement, on the verge of
    the big time, opted out.  Who knew why, really?  Kannberg would do some soapboxing when pressed in interviews (he wouldn't deal with
    <i>Rolling Stone</i> because he didn't like how they covered the 80s), but Pavement was never about principles-- at least not ones you
    could easily name.  An anti-fashion statement is still a fashion statement, but Pavement was on another trip.  They liked to make fun
    of rock iconography, but they were smart enough to avoid offering an alternative.  You never really knew where Pavement stood on anything,
    which kept an air of mystery and made their music malleable.</p><p>
    
    Pavement's sophomore outing does not contain 12 perfect songs but it is close to a perfect album.  Each of the best half-dozen--
    ""Silence Kit"", ""Elevate Me Later"", ""Cut Your Hair"", ""Unfair"", ""Gold Soundz"", and ""Range Life""-- contain Malkmus' catchy and highly
    unusual melodies (""Silence Kit"" cribs from Buddy Holly, but even that's an odd gesture) and would be career highlights for most rock
    bands.  But even the songs that aren't necessarily brilliant work well in the context of the album, moving things along in their own
    way.  The Dave Brubeck send-up ""5-4=Unity"", for example, is a perfect placeholder between two unbelievably great songs.  And the
    closing ""Fillmore Jive"" ends an album at least partly about the music industry on an appropriately classic rock note, with an extended
    group-jam coda on par with ""Hey Jude"".  Not many records are this easy to put on in the car and let play start to finish.</p><p>
<i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i> has been called one of the great California albums, but unlike most records slapped with that label,
    it avoids dreams and nightmares and focuses on the banal.  This is a <em>suburban</em> California album, and since suburbs are exactly
    the same from Sacto to Levittown, it's an album to which all suburban kids can relate.  To us, the imagery of ""Elevate Me Later""
    (""underneath the fake oil burning lamps in the city we forgot to name"") and ""Range Life"" (the kid on the skateboard is coasting through
    a winding subdivision, not Brooklyn) is instantly familiar.</p><p>
    
    But really, though <i>Crooked Rain</i> references the burbs and the music biz, with Pavement it's the sound and feel that matter, not
    the words or themes.  Quoting lyrics to get to the heart of Pavement is misguided.  Go online and print some out and you'll see that,
    taken on their own, they're generally meaningless.  Read the track-by-track notes S.M. prepared for <i>Melody Maker</i> at the time of
    the record's release (reprinted in the booklet here) and it's clear just how unknowable these songs are.  ""Stop Breathin"" is about
    tennis and the Civil War, of course; ""Elevate Me Later"" is about political correctness; ""Heaven Is a Truck"" is ""loosely based on the
    singer from Royal Trux.""  Whatever.</p><p>
    
    Judging from the several alternate takes of <i>Crooked Rain</i> songs included on Disc Two, it seems that Malkmus tinkered with words
    constantly, and that the final versions are those sung on the take that wound up in the can.  The ""I/they don't have no function"" bit
    in ""Range Life"", which most people take to be a self-deprecating line to let Malkmus off the hook for ragging on the Smashing Pumpkins
    fans, was probably just a glitch that he didn't want to go back and fix.  The early version of ""Range Life"" recorded with Gary Young
    (one of eight such unreleased tracks on the 25-track bonus disc) had no such sentiment, and lyrics-wise, it's a completely different
    song.  ""Ell Ess Two"", an early version of ""Elevate Me Later"" from the Young sessions, is also completely different and yet unintelligible
    in the same way.  It's the way words sound and the way Malkmus sings them that gives his songs meaning.</p><p>
    
    The remainder of the first disc is given over to the B-sides and compilation songs released during the period.  I've always thought
    Pavement's celebrated B-side prowess to be a tad overrated, but certainly the gorgeous and quiet ""Strings of Nashville"" is one of the
    best songs in the band's catalog (love that synthesized traffic whoosh), and ""Stare"", ""Raft"", and ""Nail Clinic"" all rate alongside
    other original <i>Crooked Rain</i> tracks.  The two R.E.M. knocks, on the other hand-- the half-cover of ""Camera"" and the ""Tweeter &amp;
    the Monkey Man""-style goof ""Unseen Power of the Picket Fence""-- are in league with ""Haunt You Down"" as weeded-out experiments for only
    the most hardcore fans.</p><p>
    
    The second disc, containing period unreleased material, is an equally mixed bag that turns up a few true gems.  The most anticipated
    tracks are the first eight, recorded in 1993 with Gary Young and never officially released in any form.  ""All My Friends"" is by far
    the best of these, and could fairly be called a Pavement classic (it would have fit quite nicely on the <i>Watery, Domestic</i> EP),
    and ""Soiled Little Filly"" is almost as good.  The three alternate versions of <i>Crooked Rain</i> songs from these sessions (""Ell Ess
    Two"", ""Range Life"", and ""Stop Breathin""), and one later re-recorded for <i>Wowee Zowee</i> (""Flux=Rad"") are interesting but ultimately
    show how Pavement had outgrown Young's primitive studio set-up (speaking of <i>Wowee Zowee</i>, early versions of ""Grounded"", ""Kennel
    District"", and two takes on ""Pueblo"" were recorded at the New York <i>Crooked Rain</i> sessions as well.  Since these are three of
    <i>Wowee</i>'s best songs, this was a fertile period indeed.)  Jokey experiments, a few strong songs, a couple instrumentals-- including
    a welcome no-vox version of ""Strings of Nashville""-- and four Peel Sessions tracks round out the generous bonus disc.  The perfect
    dusty trunk hauled down from the attic.</p><p>
<i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i> was my introduction to Pavement and I loved it instantly.  I was traveling a lot in '92 and '93 and
    was rarely close to a stereo, so somehow <i>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</i> never made it on my radar.  When I finally bought <i>S&amp;E;</i>, my
    first thought was, all right, sweet, some of these songs are as good as the ones on <i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i>.  There's no
    question that <i>S&amp;E;</i> is a fantastic record, but to me, parts of it sound like Pavement wearing a costume.  Listen to the brilliant
    ""Summer Babe"" and know that Malkmus loves Lou Reed, but East Coast cool ultimately isn't his style.  On <i>Crooked Rain</i>, Pavement
    became a band, opened up (as much as they ever could, anyway), and sounded like themselves: smart, funny, confident, West Coast,
    suburban.  The confidence was key.  Malkmus and Kannberg grew up loving bands loved by critics, and in their short history, the critics
    couldn't stop talking about them.  In 1994, they were ready to take on the world, but chose to do so in their own quiet and unforgettable
    way.</p></div>"|6200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6200-crooked-rain-crooked-rain-las-desert-origins/|10.0|Mark Richardson

Instead of ""Asleep and Dreaming"",
    Pink's debut album, <i>The Doldrums</i>, offers ""Among Dreams""; instead of ""Strange Eyes"" we get ""Strange Fires""; instead of ""The
    Death of Ferdinand de Saussure"" we get ""The Ballad of Bobby Pyn""; instead of ""Bitter Tears"" we get ""Crying""-- there's a list and it
    goes on, and the musical side of this hilarious send-up is even more masterful.</p><p>
    
    Maybe that claim is absolutely cuckoo.  I mean, it has to be.  There's no way this Hollywood hillbilly called Ariel Pink knows who
    Stephen Merritt is, and if asked, Pink would surely play Peter and deny the man three times.  Either way, I've been trying for weeks
    now to figure out if Ariel Pink is a genius, an idiot, an idiot savant, or some combination of the three.  Everybody's new favorite
    Collective-- Animal (not Nortec or Soul, though each group had its day)-- clearly seems to think highly of him.  So much so, in fact,
    that Pink's crude and crooked pop affair is Paw Tracks' first non-Animal Collective release.  That's quite a vote of confidence.</p><p>
    
    Everybody's heard these songs before-- they sound straight out of 60s pop radio, 80s shampoo commercials, and 90s soap operas.  The
    melodies themselves are great but worn from overexposure.  Yet the songs are secondary to Ariel Pink himself, the oddball who understands
    these melodies in vastly different terms than the rest of us do and, consciously or not, is dead-set on resurrecting them.  <i>The
    Doldrums</i> isn't a collection of songs so much as an excessive human spectacle-- violently personal and necessarily confrontational.
    Think autistic kids covering Brian Wilson or Tom Waits singing a nursery rhyme or Shakespeare eating shit in an alley or Jesus giving
    birth to a pack of bear cubs.</p><p>
    
    The key to all of these spectacles, of course, is sincerity, and on <i>The Doldrums</i>, Ariel Pink seems pretty goddamn sincere.
    It's a shtick record, but the self-engrossed Pink probably doesn't think so.  Its ultra lo-fi creepiness doesn't feel like a ""trick""
    so much as an unfortunate necessity, as if an eight-track was all Pink could afford.  The man is free as a bird with a rocketpack.
    He shoots off in falsetto with a smile, not a smirk.  He pens lyrics that would put Rodd Keith's clientele to hippy-happy shame.
    He explores keyboard presets that should never make their way outside of the Sam Ash piano room.  To be honest, it's all sort of
    beautiful.</p><p>
    
    My biggest gripe with <i>The Doldrums</i> is that most of these tracks are twice as long as they should be.  Yet, criticizing the
    songs for their excess completely misses the point.  This album can't contain Ariel Pink, and wasn't supposed to, and his next 500
    CD-Rs will have the same problem.  The songs are secondary to Pink's bourgeoning cult of personality-- the album turns its imperfections
    into selling points, its pigheadedness into firm resolve.</p><p>
    
    After opener ""Good Kids Make Bad Grown Ups"", we understand the supposed appeal of <i>The Doldrums</i>: These are normal songs, except
    a ""crazy"" guy is singing them, and he has ""crazy"" lo-fi production.  The rest of the album functions as half endurance test and half
    a chance for us to find reasons to say, ""Oh my god, this guy's a genius!"" in that self-congratulatory ""it takes a genius to realize
    genius"" sort of way.  I'm on the ""he's not a genius"" side-- Pink just happens to have a traditional pop sensibility but a bleak budget.
    Then again, maybe it <i>is</i> all shtick.  It's a debate that invites endless speculation, further putting the emphasis on Pink while
    taking it away from the songs themselves.</p><p>
    
    It follows, then, that the best Ariel Pink songs are the ones that do the least to shape his mystique.  ""Haunted Graffiti"" has the
    Bee Gees playing a frat party but its warbles and hisses turn the song into a high-stakes peep show.  The song's melody succeeds here
    without being tied down to Pink's off-kilter delivery.  ""Let's Build a Campfire There"" drops the Magnetic Fields parody and cuts
    straight to mimicry, and it works out nicely.  Closer ""Young Pilot Astray"" follows that same Merritt line, with a fantastically
    whimsical melody and loads and loads of vocal overdubs for the refrain.  Yet, there's something wrong about recommending any of these
    songs as starting points for Haunted Graffiti virgins: They're the most self-reliant, but they're also the least Pink. </p><p>
    
    And that's the trouble with <i>The Doldrums</i>, and the reasoning behind this conflicted rating.  The album is not so much Ariel Pink's
    creation as it is Ariel Pink himself, a real-time observation of his brain synapses at work.  His nerves are either firing at Einstein
    levels or misfiring like harlequin babies, and in fairness, I'm hardly the staff brain surgeon.</p></div>"|6553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6553-the-doldrums/|5.0|Nick Sylvester

She's so closely mic'd on this collection of demos-- available for as a free download at Comfort Stand-- that her vocals take up your entire sensory field. It's similar to the experience of standing too close to a Barnett Newman painting and seeing only the color red sporadically interrupted by thin verticals of yellow and blue. Likewise, on <i>Demos</i>, Frost's voice seems to push every other sound-- acoustic guitar, soft keyboards, ambient noises both intentional and accidental-- to the auditory margins.</p><p>
<i>Demos</i> collects early versions of songs that originally appeared on Frost's three Drag City albums-- <i>Calling Over Time</i>, <i>Telescopic</i>, and <i>Wonder Wonder</i>-- along with covers of Floyd Tillman's ""I Get the Craziest Feeling"" and Lefty Frizzell's ""Look What Thoughts Will Do"". The demos are unadorned and unfussy, without the sometimes distracting presence of the musicians who typically grace Frost's albums. This casual setting could be unflattering for lesser singers-- resulting in a strictly fans-only release-- but here it magnifies Frost's strengths. She sounds more relaxed and comfortable, and her songwriting (which I'd previously dismissed as weak) comes across as more direct and affectingly personal.</p><p>
    
    ""One Chord Complaint"" draws a great deal from a single guitar chord that repeats under her vocals, and the effect is eerily hypnotic-- an airiness reminiscent of Julee Cruise's work for David Lynch. ""Walk on the Fire"" includes street noise, children's squeals, and what sounds like someone walking on Bubble Wrap, but these sound effects are distracting and only weakly reinforce the tone conveyed by Frost's voice, lyrics, and guitar.</p><p>
    
    This stripped-down approach offers some insight into Frost's creative process: Specifically, how she develops a song from its early phase through to its recording. The version of ""Cars and Parties"" on <i>Wonder Wonder</i> has a lovely long-distance swing to it thanks to the skipping snare drum and chiming guitar; on <i>Demos</i>, the song lacks that easy motion but it sounds more steeped in homesickness. </p><p>
    
    A similar trade-off occurs with ""Wonder Wonder"": On the album which shares its name, the song features ragtag instrumentation but on the demo the tempo is slowed and the main melody is held together by a simple keyboard. The newly released version has an off-the-cuff introspectiveness that was traded for the original's sense of wide-eyed wonder. It's the same song by the same singer, yet the delivery and accompaniment subtly shade the meaning.</p><p>
    
    The pair of covers only strengthen the revelation that all Frost needs to put her songs across is her voice and maybe a guitar. Frost may sound nothing like the loser of Frizzell's ""Look What Thoughts Will Do"", but neither that selection nor the Tillman cover seems misguided or ill-advised. She performs each track as a delicate blues number with the accompaniment of Pinetop Seven's Ryan Hembrey, Dirty Three's Jim White, and Califone's Jim Becker, and yet compared to the rougher demos these covers sound relatively featureless and broad. They suffer once Frost's voice is pushed from the extreme foreground. Although her studio work often sounds spare, <i>Demos</i> is even more so and, ironically, this makes these tracks all the more overwhelming.</p></div>"|3225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3225-demos/|7.9|Stephen M.

But I can't help holding Les Georges Leningrad partially responsible. I was parked at the library when I first heard their second record, <em>Sur les Traces de Black Eskimo</em>. The album opens with ""Missing Gary"", a loony song-skit where a low frequency and ragged screams ballast a monologue that seems like a skewed award acceptance speech, culminating in the problem with Gary, who won't let anyone else drive the tour van. The intro augurs the darkly ironic sense of humor and unhinged, abrasive dub-punk that inform the record, and just as I was settling in to its haywire aesthetic, it happened. Without warning, my speakers belched out a volley of bass tones so stridently concussive that my car literally rocked on its chassis; I actually thought that another vehicle had plowed into my own. It seemed like a willful, malicious bit of mischief: ""Let's see if we can blow out unsuspecting listeners' speakers.""</p><p>
    
    Which isn't too far-fetched, considering that mischief is Montreal art-marauders Les Georges Leningrad's calling card. The band has dubbed their chaotic, tongue-in-cheek concoction ""petrochemical rock,"" a mangled mass of dubby Pere Ubuism, shuddering electronic clangor, lean post-punk guitars, and surreal lyrical non-sequiturs. They perform in crude, vaguely totemic paper masks, with antics bordering on G.G. Allin-style shock art-- albeit with a more irreverent and less scatological bent. Their interviews read like Antonin Artaud poems, and are more like extensions of their artistic sensibility than informative conduits (from a <em>Seattle Weekly</em> interview: ""We were four heads screwed on a crab body. Now we are three creatures."").</p><p>
    
    But like all of Les Georges Leningrad's giddy nonsense, a truth is concealed beneath the absurdity-- they were a four piece on their debut, <em>Deux Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou</em>, but they've scaled back to three for this follow-up, which profits from the trimmer roster. While all their rasping aggression remains intact, it's more streamlined than on their occluded debut and the songs are more catchy and discernible. The story of the Black Eskimo ostensibly frames the record, but it seems like another red herring, another layer of preposterous juxtaposition. </p><p>
    
    After the aforementioned barrage of bass subsides, ""Missing Gary"" collapses into rigid, whip-cracking drum and bass, cries of ""Let me drive, let me drive"" cloaked in shifting digital afflatus. ""Sponsorships"" would be well-suited to driving at night while hopped up on meth (not that Pitchfork condones such an activity); cracking drums and an angry hornets' nest of guitars buffet Poney P as she whisks her bratty caterwaul around blind curves. The inflexible dub of ""Black Eskimo"" intersperses its lockstep sections with expanses of arid, windswept effluvium. ""Nebraska's Valentine"" is one of a couple tracks built on a foundation of bass so deep and soupy it buzzes down the spine with the dull ache of a Mini Thin high. And the galloping acid-disco of ""Supa Dupa"" is as close as Les Georges Leningrad come to what passes for traditional in post-punk, all pounding drums and precisely careening bass. </p><p>
    
    Cursory, half-baked references to Dada abound in modern music, but Les Georges Leningrad seem genuinely steeped in it. They're not satisfied with name dropping, they inject the disruptive, exuberant spirit of Dada into every aspect of their music and public personas. Ffor fans of post-punk that's challenging and artistically informed-- but not self-important-- <em>Sur les Traces de Black Eskimo</em> comes highly recommended. Just do yourself a favor, crank the bass on your equalizer down low before you give it a spin.</p></div>"|4963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4963-sur-les-traces-de-black-eskimo/|7.8|Brian Howe

Like Folds, the Son, Ambulance leader composes on piano and sings with an adenoidal Elvis Costello intonation, but it's nevertheless a suspiciously shallow appraisal. Knapp never broaches the kitschy, ironic-piano-man sensibility Folds seems to prefer. At root, Knapp's songs are entirely different: murky, sepia-toned daguerreotypes of earnest idealism and ephemeral melody.</p><p>
    
    Knapp's frequent Conor Oberst comparisons are easier to justify-- especially considering he debuted his syrupy drawl on Bright Eyes' <em>Every Day and Every Night</em>. Son, Ambulance first appeared on <em>Oh Holy Fools</em>, a split EP with Bright Eyes on which Knapp's ramshackle confections easily outshone Oberst's meandering emoting.  Still, the comparison only holds up in regards to the broadest traits-- Knapp's songs are exponentially more delicate and sanguine than Oberst's. The parallel evolution of their songwriting styles, which culminates with <em>Key</em>, is more salient.</p><p>
    
    Son, Ambulance's debut LP, <em>Euphemystic</em>, and Oberst's work through <em>Fevers and Mirrors</em> shared an amateurish basement charm-- imperfections were left intact; the compositions seemed intuitive and untrained. Now, just as Oberst replaced the spare demeanor of <em>Fevers and Mirrors</em> with the sprawling, orchestral inflation of <em>The Story is in the Soil, Knapp has recruited a new (seemingly more refined and experienced) band for </em><em>Key</em>. The new musicians forgo the gauzy, playful dilettantism of <em>Euphemystic</em> in favor of expansive pop marathons, akin to the stripe of pre-millennial mainstream rock more interested in complex composition and multi-instrumentalism than synthesizers and drum machines (except for ""House Guest"" and ""Glitter Angel"", two grainy, bubbling forays into synth-pop). It's not hard to imagine the reverberating piano and gritty, soloing guitar of the album's first proper song, ""Paper Snowflakes"", nestling snugly between left-field favorites like American Music Club and Talk Talk. </p><p>
    
    Usually, stylistic revision takes place visibly and incrementally, but Son, Ambulance's new brew fermented in the silence between their debut and this sophomore release, and it's jarring when the man who once covered the ""Sesame Street"" theme song suddenly tries his hand at ""mature"" songwriting. <em>Key</em> isn't just the name of Knapp's new record, it's also what his voice still freely drifts in and out of, and while his unsteady falsetto dovetailed naturally with his former band's looseness, it oddly sits on the impregnable foundations constructed by his new crack players, particularly on graver numbers like ""Sex in C Minor"". </p><p>
    
    But ""oddly"" doesn't mean ""badly,"" and traces of the old Son, Ambulance linger, most notably on ""Billy Budd"". With its hushed synth drone, flecks of acoustic guitar, and Knapp's most winsome vocals, it evokes <em>Oh Holy Fools</em>'s ""The Invention of Beauty"" in its calm, austere comeliness. And lyrically, Knapp still veers between sentimental imagery-- here, he pledges to follow the object of his desire and catch her tears in a bucket, and to use that warm water ""to make tea for you""-- and pithy turns that cut through the music's pollyannaish romanticism: ""You say that you're sick, but I think you're just bored."" The same goes for the skittering drums, laddering piano, chiming guitars and amorphous edges of ""Chlorophyll"". </p><p>
    
    Overall, <em>Key</em> often sounds the way a child trying on his father's suit looks: serious, rumpled, and proudly beaming. It's an endearing quality, provided that you're not offended when Knapp's cracking voice occasionally wanders out of the precise hedge-maze of the music. Let's just hope that on the next album, he doesn't fire himself and hire Elton John to do the vocals, completing the transition and completely abandoning the tremulous heart of Son, Ambulance in the process. </p></div>"|7327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7327-key/|7.5|Brian Howe

Where did they go?  Five years ago, I was ready to trot off with them to
    Neptune, digging my arm into their furry, electric heels.  That was space music, right?  Wasn't that what
    they meant to do in the 70s before anyone had told them that you can be hyper and blissed-out at the same
    time?  It sure seemed like it.  And then they just disappeared, only cropping up outside of Japan at
    sparsely planned eclectic music festivals (that were usually in Europe).  In the interim, we got remix
    albums, some spare influence for neo-no-wavers, and a whole lotta side projects.  And I'm not even trying
    to overlook the side projects, because the last Psycho-Baba album was a lot more interesting than th-- okay,
    I'll get there in a minute.</p><p>
    
    The answer to Boredoms' whereabouts during the Pitchfork Ascendance was that they sort of broke up and went
    their own thousand separate ways.  Guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto and bassist Hila either left or were fired
    from the band some time around the turn of this century.  Give or take a year; everything's pretty sketchy.
    I've read interviews with Yamamoto where he talks about not wanting to keep himself restricted to just one
    band.  I've read interviews with de facto leader Yamatsuka Eye where he talks about wanting to love the sun.
    Suffice to say, there was a communication breakdown.  So, Boredoms became ""Vooredoms"", with Eye, longtime
    drummer Yoshimi P-We, and two more drummers-- ATR and E-Da-- who'd come aboard when the band had originally
    gone psychedelic in the late-90s.</p><p>
    
    V8redoms have yet to release any music.  They've played lots of shows over the past few years, and true to
    Eye's concept for the band as a human turntable, their music spins out the jammiest aspects of Boredoms'
    <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i> and stretches them to epic lengths.  Live, its probably an amazing experience;
    exhausting, hedonistic.  Speaking as someone with a fair amount of bootleg mp3s of these shows, I can say
    that the hour-long drums-and-synth template can be a bit trying as a sit-down listen.</p><p>
    
    And now, out of the clear blue sky, we have <i>Seadrum/House of Sun</i>.  It's credited to Boredoms, which
    makes me wonder if it's actually a new recording, or something leftover.  It also comes with zero recording
    information, musical credits, or any liner notes whatsoever (even any of that cool Eye magic-marker art),
    in a blue plastic jewel case with cover art that looks stenciled.  Wtf?  Still, none of that would be so
    perplexing if the sounds contained inside packed that super-Bore punch.  They don't.  In fact, if I had to
    guess, the two tracks on this CD really were leftovers from after <i>VCN</i>.  They sound like unedited,
    marathon jams; the kind that on previous records would have been condensed into concentrated, five-minute
    mini-trips, and used as part of some electric DJ mix.  At best, this sounds like a stopgap.</p><p>
    
    Now, that said, <i>Seadrum/House of Sun</i> features one of the coolest beginnings of any Boredoms album.
    Yoshimi introduces ""Seadrum"" with an unaccompanied vocal cadenza, sounding like an island witch serenading
    the dawn.  As she sings her final note, a thick wave of drums, filled out with thunderous reverb like the
    roar of tidal waves, drowns her out.  Pounding, primal percussion is Boredoms' specialty these days, and
    even when the piano (!) enters later, the vibe is ecstatic.  The piano's black-key glissandos turn trance-rock
    into Asian rhapsody, and when combined with Yoshimi's re-emergent vocals, give the band a tranquil, dreamy
    sound I've never heard from them before.  And it just keeps on going.  On and on.  Sometimes the drums change
    their pattern for a few bars (my favorite is when they pull out the tablas and tuned percussion for futuristic
    tropical craziness), but in general, ""Seadrum"" coasts where it should surge.</p><p>
    
    Of course, compared to the second track, it's practically explosive.  ""House of Sun"" is a 24-minute comedown
    drone.  Sitars and guitars are lushly layered into a churning, monolithic mass of sound-- and like the
    preceding song, it goes on for way too long.  Acid Mothers Temple's ""In D"" was similar, but Boredoms go
    for sensory overload rather than tranquil meditation; after 20 minutes, my ears are numb (and my brain has
    long since checked out).  In theory, Boredoms furthering their psychedelic side should be fantastic, and I
    have to admit that for sheer orgasmic sprawl, few bands have much on them.  However, at a point, sprawl
    becomes tedious and indulgent-- and I never thought I'd say that about Boredoms.</p></div>"|11679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11679-seadrumhouse-of-sun/|6.0|Dominique Leone

After 13 years and seven studio albums, bandleader Dean Wareham decided it was time to cap his second band's run while it was still riding high and avoid a potential acrimonious breakdown, such as the one that felled his legendary first band, Galaxie 500.  As it is, Luna's original rhythm section of ex-Chills bassist Justin Harwood and ex-Feelies drummer Stanley Demeski-- which, along with Wareham, had afforded Luna a sort of indie rock supergroup status-- departed in the late 90s, precipitating a gradual shift in the band's music toward the middle of the road.  Thankfully, Wareham put the brakes on before they got there, and <i>Rendezvous</i> is a worthy if not exactly earth-moving capstone to the band's career.</p><p>
    Luna were never a particularly intense band, but early albums like <i>Bewitched</i> and <i>Penthouse</i> ballasted their whispier tendencies with Wareham and Sean Eden's searing guitar duels and spiraling VU/TV riffs, which have now changed from sparring matches into polite conversations.  They still do lovely things-- see the closing moments of ""Star-Spangled Man"" for a glimpse of the fire that once burned regularly from these fingers-- but <i>Rendezvous</i> by and large is an intimate, close-listening affair, stuffed with hushed, rewarding melodies, subtly lulling backing vocals from bassist Britta Phillips, and the occasional surprising textural ripple.</p><p>
    Wareham could never be accused of being a gifted vocalist but at this stage of his life, he's learned to tailor what he sings to fit his natural instrument, and his relaxed, steady nonchalance puts the right spin on his lyrical wit and self-deprecation.  Eden takes the mic on two songs here, too, and he makes the most of it-- particularly when his Jason Lytle-ish tenor climbs to a spellbinding falsetto in the gorgeous chorus of the impeccably spacey ballad ""Broken Chair.""</p><p>
    Impeccable is really the order of the day, as every note feels well-selected from a matching set, and even when the band kicks up the tempo-- as they do on ""Astronaut""-- they demonstrate restraint.  Drummer Lee Wall, usually filling in space with his brushes and generally staying out of the way, gets to let loose a bit on the song with a  barreling motorik beat as Wareham wryly references the Tamil Tigers in his worshipful/self-effacing entreaties to a lover.  As note\xD0perfect as it all is, though, it's also a tad predictable, and the pretty slide guitar interjections and melodic rhythm guitar parts add up merely to the sum of their parts, which is impressive but never transcendent.</p><p>
    Seriously though, if you're a Wareham fan, you're unlikely to be disappointed.  Luna's discography-- lackluster live album aside-- has been remarkably consistent, with a few high peaks but nary a valley in sight, and <i>Rendezvous</i> continues that trend.  All of the members already have other projects in the works (Philips and Wareham have already released a side album as a duo), and it seems as though they will put Luna rather quickly behind them.  I'm sad to see them go, but I'm glad they went out strong.</p></div>"|4919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4919-rendezvous/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Based on the complex theories behind her work, I figured she could introduce me to some crazy stuff.  But she looked at me as though the question held little interest and said, ""I don't know... Bach, mostly.  And a lot of folk music.  Some Pink Floyd.""  I was pretty surprised that, given the amount of mental effort her work asked of its listeners, she herself kept to music with such direct emotional power.</p><p>
    
    Still, it's an understandable inconsistency-- ""cutting-edge"" music isn't always synonymous with ""inviting."" No matter how much I dig Milton Babbitt, I'm more likely to put on Iron &amp; Wine when I get home.  The IDM/ambient sphere of artists and listeners has always had an underlying interest in marrying these extremes. (For example, Aphex Twin works at both the most abrasive and warm ends of the spectrum.)  Many artists on the Kranky label are concerned with creating a synthesis of music that has ""artistic"" merit and that which remains inviting, and <i>The Dead Texan</i> is an album that achieves such a goal.  It's a refined, original sound, but one that gives a listener more than it takes.</p><p>
    
    The Dead Texan is Adam Wiltzie, one half of Stars of the Lid, a band that has produced some of the best guitar-based ambient/drone music of the past 10 years.  Rather than take the Fennesz or Keith Fullerton Whitman approach of mutating and splicing guitar tones, SOTL create reverberant drones through the expert manipulation of attack and decay.  Wiltzie recorded the material for <i>The Dead Texan</i> while in Belgium and deemed it too ""aggressive"" for SOTL.  And it is, though ""aggressive"" is a relative term when applied to music that sits upon the brink of consciousness.  </p><p>
    
    Wiltzie doesn't depart dramatically from SOTL's most recent full-length, <i>The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid</i>; he employs similar two-chord repetitions, swells of stacked-fifths, and utilizes many of the same timbres-- swirling string-quartet drones and effects-laden piano.  But as The Dead Texan, Wiltzie's music takes on a more composed quality.  It cycles through complete chord progressions, allows steady rhythmic pulses, lets loose just a little bit of dissonance, and occasionally overlays vocals or an instrumental melody.  His drones are accented with acoustic and slide guitars, as well as occasional samples and sine waves.  While by no means traditional songs, the pieces of <i>The Dead Texan</i> thus feel at least like miniatures-- more manageable than SOTL's wide-open scapes, which can be devoid of reference points.</p><p>
    
    It's a wildly overused trope to describe dramatic instrumental music as ""the soundtrack to ________"" (e.g.: a rainy day, a lonely drive, an acid trip, a bear attack)-- the phrase is used to connote a sense of detachment engendered by such music, one that allows us to view our lives as a movie.  But in this case, discussing the record's cinematic leanings is justified.  Wiltzie has stated the influence of several film composers, and the title of his piece ""La Ballade d'Alain Georges"" namedrops an old French actor.  More overtly, this release includes a DVD of videos for several of Wilzie's compositions-- all made by filmmaker Christina Vantzos.  Her accompaniment for ""Aegina Airlines"" combines beautifully simple animation with abstract hues, representing the clarity of various musical elements through a literal ""clarity"" of imagistic presentation.  Wiltzie shows himself increasingly drawn toward the world of film compositions-- a safe haven for modern composers who don't necessarily want to engage in ""modern composition.""</p><p>
    
    The vocal additions to ""Glen's Goo"" and ""The Struggle"" lend the songs a shoegaze tinge, recalling the hushed moments of Slowdive.  In these spots, The Dead Texan's sense of cathedral-like reverence is balanced with extreme intimacy.  Throughout, the attention to sound-quality and design is nearly as impressive as the music itself.  Wiltzie has come quite far from his four-track recording days; <i>The Dead Texan</i> is an entirely enveloping album from a skilled craftsperson.  Currently, he's working with Brian McBride on a new Stars of the Lid release, and with The Dead Texan as an indication, we should be very excited-- in a laid-back, barely conscious sort of way.</p></div>"|2585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2585-the-dead-texan/|8.2|Liam Singer

No, they're not the
    alternative rock ""supergroup"" featuring ex-members of Ugly Kid Joe, Soulfly, Machine Head, Life of Agony, dayinthelife, and Skrew--
    that's just plain Medication.  Medication<i>s</i> are a trio that look an awful lot like defunct Dischord band Faraquet because...
    well, it's virtually the same band. When Faraquet bassist Jeff Boswell went his own way in 2003, that band's drummer, Chad Molter,
    stepped into his spot alongside guitarist Devin Ocampo, and Andrew Becker was brought in to man the traps.</p><p>
    
    Unsurprisingly, then, Medications sound a lot like Faraquet-- the same two guys are handling the vocals, and Ocampo's knotty guitar lines still slither and slash through the arrangements like murderous hydras.  Medications have toned back the odd meters, and Ocampo and Molter frequently engage in two-part harmonizing, which gives Medications a much poppier, more melodic angle on the D.C. sound than their ancestor band.  Indeed, there are moments when the vocal melodies veer almost into Real Book territory, evoking the pop melodies of a bygone era-- albeit over pounding drums, shimmying hand percussion, and contorted guitar riffs.</p><p>
    
    ""Exercise Your Futility"" contains a pronounced (and surprising) nod to The Kinks' music hall sensibilities in its middle eight. (How many times do you get to mention the ""middle eight"" in a Dischord review?).  But again, that melody is alongside guitars that would have caused embarrassing bowel shifts in Rodgers &amp; Hart, as well as perfectly honed Dischord lyrical volleys such as, ""'Forget crawling the distance,' I slowly groan/ Tired of inspiration/ Trying to catch my breath all alone.""  The track's bass and percussion are funky, and the declamatory verse vocals drop into the pocket with intense, swaggering efficiency-- if there were a Dischord textbook, this might be one of its first lessons. </p><p>
    
    Opener ""Safe and Sorry"" sports no hint of the distinguishing characteristics that separate Medications from Faraquet: The production duo of Chad Clark and T.J. Lipple give it a sympathetically dry and wiry sound, one that gives Ocampo's guitar the character of a pile of gnarled sticks.  But by the time you reach the hand percussion coda that caps off ""Domestic Animals"", the differences are stark: Ocampo is throwing lead lines that he never would have played on <i>The View from This Tower</i>, and Medications are spitting out anthems where Faraquet would have been content with splintered grooves and sing-speak anti-melody.</p><p>
    
    So count <i>Medications</i> as a small step in a bolder direction for the former members of Faraquet. Hopefully, their first full-length expands on what this EP delivers because these five songs are memorable and accessible enough to both make inroads outside of the D.C. scene and its admirers and-- along with Q and Not U and Fugazi-- help forge some shifts within that scene itself.</p></div>"|5610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5610-medications-ep/|7.5|Joe Tangari

The record is a departure from Hitchcock's usual eccentric left-of-the-dial pop, a left turn almost as unique as the story behind the album's creation: One of Hithcock's friends sent him a photo of the coronation of a new Miss Ohio named Robyn Hitchcock; the coincidence reminded the English singer of a striking live performance of Gillian Welch's ""Miss Ohio"".</p><p>
    
    How different is <i>Spooked</i>?  It begins with Hitchcock scat-singing a melody line that typically may have been played by a guitar or a keyboard.  The track, ""Television"", has an understated but pretty three-part harmony, and even though the song's titular subject is a bit worn, it still develops a very Cronenberg-ian relationship with its subject matter: ""My kid will look like you, I swear."" If only he could have gotten Debbie Harry for a duet.</p><p>
    
    The 11 tracks that follow (one of which is a spoken-word aside) all feature spare instrumentation-- often just one or two strummed acoustic guitars-- but they aren't stripped-down versions of the types of pop songs with which Hitchcock has built a sizeable cult audience. Instead, <i>Spooked</i> sounds closer to folk-inspired songs Hitchcock performed very early in his career, his recent forays into Dylaniana, and Welch's prefab Americana.  For Hitchcock, it's both a departure and a return to his roots. </p><p>
    
    The album boasts an array of instruments, albeit all played for ""MTV Unplugged"" effect.  NRBQ's Joey Spampinato takes bass on two songs; ""Everybody Needs Love"" features electric sitar (one that's more Beatles than Dylan); and harmonicas, organs, and percussion show up throughout. The album has a spontaneity that makes Hitchcock sound newly invigorated, but it's a little shapeless. <i>Spooked</i> doesn't seem especially well thought-out, and while that could be part of its charm, some songs-- like ""Creeped Out"" and ""We're Gonna Live in the Trees""-- sound underdeveloped and often outright irritating.  Furthermore, this austere folk sound isn't always the best setting for Hitchcock's voice and songwriting.  While ""Television"" and ""Flanagan's Song"" sound perfectly suited to this sound, ""If You Know Time"" and the nearly a cappella ""Demons and Fiends"" cry out for a faster tempo, a sturdy backbeat, and an electric guitar.</p><p>
    
    What holds <i>Spooked</i> together is the same thing that seems to have inspired its title: Hitchcock's fascination with America and American music, which suggests a darker reading of the album, one that depicts the United States as a terminally spooky place, akin to Greil Marcus' ""old weird America.""  Hitchcock's is a new weird America: There's a palpable eeriness behind the fluorescent sheen of strip malls, suburban sprawl, and dubious politics.  He namedrops Condoleeza Rice on the spoken-word ""Welcome to Earth""; ""Creeped Out"" is about American girls who ""tell the future every 28 days""; and his cover of Dylan's travelogue ""Trying to Get to Heaven Before They Close the Door"" sounds newly, nervily paranoid from a non-American point of view.</p><p>
    
    This dread, mostly unnamable but certainly strong, suffuses the album with a gravity that extends from the first song through the last. Still, for all its anxiety, <i>Spooked</i> often sounds generous, even hopeful, especially on ""Everybody Needs Love"", on which Hitchcock sings, ""Some people are maimed/ They're not as worth it as the label on them claims/ But everybody needs love."" That's a mantra that new weird America could embrace.</p></div>"|3889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3889-spooked/|7.2|Stephen M. Deusner

Can you feel yourself getting jaded?  There's nothing you can do to     stop it.  Your once-torrid show-going pace has slowed to a crawl, you can no longer stand sitting through     opening acts, you start wishing for anti-smoking legislation instead of bumming cigarettes, your back     hurts.  Older tracks begin to infiltrate your iPod, new albums have a shorter grace period before deletion,     sometimes you chose to just read a book.  You start to realize that the bands you're listening to are actually     younger than you are, for the first time, and this realization finally breaks the dam you've built against     constantly playing Spot-the-Influence.  Past nostalgia starts to overtake present enjoyment, and no longer     are you a first-order listener, frantically casting out nets to be the first one to the next big thing.</p><p>You know it's a bad sign when even the old reliables stop delivering, when their new release barely dislodges     previous albums from your rotation, when you start pleading for them to play old songs live like your parents     at a CSN concert.  Want specifics?  Let's take, oh, say Ted Leo for your example.  You and Ted have crossed     figurative paths for five years now, since the night he lent precious indie cred to your college house's     basement by performing there accompanied by only a reel-to-reel (even though you feared booking a guy from     some scary-sounding band called Chisel).  From then on, you never re-met in person, but fan-love bloomed     over rush hour singalongs to <em>The Tyranny of Distance</em>.  While living in Leo's once-home of D.C., you     attended most of his frequent visits, wrote gospel-like reviews about <em>Hearts of Oak</em> for a rambunctious     webzine, and generally formed a one-man street team for the man and his Pharmacists.</p><p>Your first sign that relations might be fading was when <em>Shake the Streets</em> hit the file-sharing black     market, and you were taken by surprise-- you hadn't even updated your wishlist.  Now, months later, the usual     Ted Leo delayed sink-in has yet to occur, despite frequent commute listening parties.  Which begs the question:     Is it you that changed, or is it Ted?</p>
<p>Or perhaps, more accurately, has Ted not changed enough?  You can't help but notice that <em>Shake the Sheets</em> is the most Chisel-sounding record he's released as a solo artist, returning to stripped-down arrangements     and, on ""The Angel's Share"" and ""Little Dawn"", his fascination with repetition.  Gone is the more aggressively     percussive approach of <em>Hearts of Oak</em>, the drum-circle assault of ""Ballad of the Sin Eater"" that took     your head off more than once at dark Black Cat performances.  The Pharmacists have receded back to a power     trio format, a slight expansion from Leo's recent pretending-he's-Billy-Bragg jaunt, not attempting to toy     with crooked arrangements or extraneous instruments.</p>
<p>Instead, Leo focuses on making a ruler-straight power-pop album, a facsimile of a late 70s punk-fed singer/songwriter     LP with cover art featuring the artist against a solid-color background.  You're less entertained by the     Thin Lizzy flourishes, here on the other side of The Darkness' full-flung tributes.  You're finding it more     difficult to make Dexys comparisons, now that you're starting to appreciate how awesome Dexys actually was.</p>
<p>You also find yourself surprised that Ted Leo isn't taking advantage of his political timing-- a release     date Michael Moore would kill for-- just as you're surprised to find yourself looking for political music     at all.  ""Ballad of the Sin Eater"" was the best description of ugly-American guilt you'd ever heard or read     or danced to, so the relatively limp and general ""I wanna sweep the walls of arrogance"" criticisms of <em>Shake     the Sheets</em> can't help but disappoint.  Instead, you find Leo mired in unrepresentative cliché-driven     lyrical content like, ""It's time for getting down,"" from ""Criminal Piece"".  But no, you shouldn't presume     to know what Leo should sing about, you definitely should not presume that.</p>
<p>In a strange turn of events, you find yourself not as into Leo's usual tics: his unhinged vocals and spasmodic     guitar.  You find yourself strangely aggravated by Leo's characteristic punk-scat; especially unforgivable     is a Jacko-like ""shebooyah"" in ""Walking to Do"".  It doesn't help that most of these vocal detours are placed     into songs (""Walking to Do"", ""Counting Down the Hours"") that sound like the wait music for Splash Mountain.</p>
<p>But the question again: Is it you, or is it Ted?  Is it silly for you to hold artists to the standard of     constant evolution, dismissing all efforts to double-back on formerly fertile territory?  Is it unfair to     apply the context of your current musical frustration to the innocent victim of <em>Shake the Sheets</em>?     Is constant self-awareness and within-review second-guessing drying up as a valid stylistic trick?  Is it     possible to be too subjective when you're writing opinion pieces?  You wonder if the whole second-person     device has really defused the self-indulgence of this very review.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you hope your arbitrary ten-point scale score adequately conveys that, while disappointing,     <em>Shake the Sheets</em> remains better than most of its current brethren in indie cryostasis.  You feel a     pang of guilt at holding Ted Leo to such high, possibly unreasonable standards, a pang of self-disappointment     that you no longer have the iron constitution to be breezily dismissive of a review's ripple effects.  But     the largest pang of all is the stereotypical one of sadness, mourning the lost ability to follow a favorite     artist down any path, the willful naivety to cloak any sub-par effort in the forgiving deafness of fandom.     And then having to write about it.</p></div>"|4741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4741-shake-the-sheets/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

    Cyann &amp; Ben-- the Locust-hijacked space-folk space folks from Paris-- used to wear button-down shirts, 
    smoke Dunhills, and keep their mobiles in leather cases; now their drummer is trouncing around in a onesie
    shouting about how far he can stand from the urinal and still ""make it.""  Now come on, that's just impossible.</p><p>
    
    Hans &amp; Frans they're not, but Cyann &amp; Ben did have a noble air to them on their 2003 debut <i>Spring. 
    On that album, the band took small steps but the kingly weight of those moves shook the earth.  Cyann &amp; 
    Ben left most notes unheard and the rest hushed and whispered, extending folk minimalism well beyond the 
    clouds.  ""Siren Song"" is the closest we earthlings get to martian transmissions.</i></p><p>
    
    Space is still the place on <i>Happy Like an Autumn Tree</i>, but Cyann &amp; Ben are less subtle-- and perhaps
    even a little boisterous-- about their prerogative this time.  The band plays as if it has an idea what it 
    sounds like (or what it's ""supposed"" to sound like, whatever that means), and sometimes it feels as if 
    Cyann &amp; Ben get caught up in making songs ""spacey"" instead of letting their flying saucers attack at will.</p><p>
    
    The massive whirling synth/piano/drum figures that blast open ""Circle"" could very well appear in the 
    orchestra score for a theater version of ""Galaxy Quest""-- I'm not convinced that's a good thing.  But 
    Cyann &amp; Ben have higher expectations of themselves, and soon settle into a stately etude for piano, 
    guitar, and voice that leaves implicit the song's early bombast.  It's a terrible case of BLOTS-- Bad 
    Lead-Off Track Syndrome-- because on the rest of <i>Autumn Tree</i> the band steers clear of such stone-thrown
    hubris.  ""Silence and Little Melodies For..."" is <i>OK Computer</i>'s ""Fitter, Happier"" without the 
    Macintalking; ""Gone to Waste"" and ""Close to Discovery"" brood like sumptuous dark side epics-- the latter
    madly bowed and Charalambidean.  This is good theater.</p><p>
    
    As it progresses, <i>Autumn Tree</i> becomes increasingly ambitious, and we're rewarded with ""A Moment 
    Nowhere""-- by far Cyann &amp; Ben's most masterful song to date.  The beat's a little too pronounced but that 
    hardly matters once the band begins unraveling Cyann's wrenched melody (""How many words will I rhyme?/ Does
    it get me closer to you?"") into louder and louder electric guitar solos, racks and racks of distortion, 
    and a frightening Orff chorus at the end.  The beautiful ""Summer"" falls cleanly between <i>Spring</i>'s
    Sparta and <i>Autumn Tree</i>'s Neronian Rome, filling the space with unexpected harmonies and synth 
    flourishes when appropriate.</p><p>
    
    ""Summer"" would have been a great place for Cyann &amp; Ben to end their album, as the song touches upon their 
    past and present sounds with plenty of good omen to boot.  Instead, the commonplace and somewhat affected 
    ""Obsessing and Screaming Voice in a Shell"" calls Cyann &amp; Ben to the curtain with off-broadway slide guitars
    and trite RPG melodies.  Which is not to say <i>Autumn Tree</i> runs short on good moments; what was great

The post-punk parvenus find the majority of their musical roots across the Atlantic-- aping all of the usual post-punk suspects with their peppy breed of pellucid, chorus-driven rock-- but Trouble Everyday hail from Philadelphia, just over the river from Camden, N.J. Either way, Trouble Everyday waste no time laying their strengths out on the table. The track nicely sets the tone for this taut collection as crunchy but limpid guitars steer the song toward a classic two-word chorus: ""Red light"", brays vocalist Kyle Costill repeatedly over a set of tension-relieving change-ups. The song-- like <i>Days vs. Nights</i> as a whole-- is constructed with familiar materials: urgent eighth-note guitar attacks, syncopated vocal yelps, and jumpy melodic bass lines. But these seemingly run-of-the-mill source elements are deftly handled and transformed into something potent by near-perfect mixing and the band's earnestness.</p><p>
    Trouble Everyday are all about distillation: At under a half-hour, <i>Days vs. Nights</i> economically maneuvers through 11 songs, each complete with air-tight structure and an endlessly hummable refrain. Although derivative to the point of being almost obtrusive, these songs are uniformly catchy-- and ain't that the bottom line? <i>Days vs. Nights</i> hits all the major touchstones, cavorting from infectious two-minute buzz of ""Kids (Make a Living)"" to the dirgeful, Joy Division-style post-punk of ""Code Word"" to the scuzzed-up sensitive guy new wave of ""(Close Enough to Call it) Even"". But Trouble Everyday's influences extend beyond the usual anglophilic tributes to include a number of American bands. ""Written in Snakes""-- with its shout-sung lyrics and jammy, open-sounding recording quality-- is reminiscent of <i>Lonesome Crowded West</i>-era Modest Mouse. And songs like the aforementioned ""Code Word"" owe not only their stylistic founding fathers, but also latter-day torchbearers such as The Rapture and Interpol.</p><p>
    As strange as it may sound, without those modern heirs a band like Trouble Everyday might not be enjoying the attention they're getting. For post-punk revivalists-- even those as adroit as Trouble Everyday-- it's best of times, worst of times: The <i>cause cl\x8Fbre</i> of bands like The Strokes and Franz Ferdinand means increased exposure for but also an inevitable (and, in this case, unjust) backlash against other purveyors of the form. Trouble Everyday even offer what could be construed as acknowledgment of this problem when on ""Camden"", Costill sings, ""Hey you, what you think about the new fad?"" Unfortunately, Costill's ironic salvo will likely do little to stop the knee-jerk reactions against his band.</p></div>"|8273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8273-days-vs-nights/|7.7|Sam Ubl

Avant-turntablists Philip Jeck and Janek Schaefer tackle those challenges on <i>Songs for Europe</i>, painting portraits of Athens and Istanbul by treading deserted streets and trying to reanimate those lanes and avenues with their recordings.</p>
<p>Jeck is a vinyl mortician who mixes discarded records and their decayed sounds as if circulating formaldehyde through their grooves. Schaefer finds peace in discord, employing his custom ""triphonic"" or three-armed turntable. His <i>musique concrete</i> pieces tend to evoke an ominous sense of mortal doom, yet enrapture in the process.</p>
<p><i>Songs for Europe</i> fuses Jeck and Schaefer's methodologies as the pair chisel haunted soundscapes from Greek and Turkish records purchased in each nation's ancient city. The political baggage could be tremendous: Centuries of Greek-Turkish history are blood-written-- from the Ottoman conquest to the present territorial strife in Cyprus. The thematic dread of <i>Songs</i> could dramatize this conflict, but the music is so typically Jeck and Schaefer that such speculation is moot. While listening to their raw palette, it's instead easier to visualize over 2,000 years of history touchable on every brick of the Acropolis or St. Sophia.</p>
<p>The album's seven tracks are divided between the two cities where they were recorded, yet they all share a similar and rather monotonous mood. Jeck and Schaefer mainly chose to sample and bleed together folk records to sound melancholic-- often tying 20 pounds of rocks to string ballads floating on a river. Their looped samples also mechanize the soulful expressions caught on the records-- like faint memories that must be routinely recalled.</p>
<p>Istanbul is introduced in ""Taxim"", a funeral march that simmers with a boiler-room drone amongst scattered tinny, insectoid guitar melodies. Contorting the song's impact are abrupt blasts of corroded rock 'n' roll and random radio dial twirling. The stronger ""Istanbul Drift"" loops what sounds like construction site hammering while a Muslim prayer chant pollinates the air. Such industrial harmony brilliantly phases through a subwoofer-abusive bass rumble and a flower pedal-picking guitar solo. It's this symbiosis between the machine and the soul that makes <i>Songs</i> so unforgettable.</p>
<p>The Athens tracks are denser and glummer. ""Song for Europe"" melts accordion samples into a stream of ether with female dishwasher operas and oceanic drones sailing toward the horizon and falling off the world's edge. ""Acropolis Now"" (ugh), is another <i>danse macabre</i>-- this time led by prancing reeds and violins, along with a supernatural, stylus-flickered organ loop that pans between the stereo channels.</p>
<p>Making the best use of the seesawing stereo is the closer, ""Lullaby Duel""-- the one instance on <i>Songs</i> that Greek-Turkish tension is potentially addressed. The first half of the track is a sore-throated ballad of gentle, harmonic feedback, bass guitar jangles, and sandpapered vinyl noise. A guitar duet then emerges from the mire, with each performer separated by the stereo channel. After they pluck a melody, they jump to the next channel to keep their careful distance. Jeck and Schaefer then let a turntable stylus run off the record and their phono cartridge buzz for over a minute. It's a reminder that recorded music is nothing more than domesticated electricity kept alive by machines.</p></div>"|4228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4228-songs-for-europe-with-janek-schaefer/|7.6|Cameron Macdonald

This might not be a surprise to anyone keeping tabs on the former Dead Kennedys singer, whose scathing leftist diatribes have been the primary focus of a consistently fascinating but frustratingly uneven career. This time, the root of Biafra's frustration-- aside from the threat of global terrorism, the Bush administration's response to the threat of global terrorism, and, uh, yuppies in Cadillacs-- is personal: The Melvins approached him about a possible collaboration after witnessing the supposed Dead Kennedys ""reunion,"" which-- after a series of inter-band legal disputes-- occurred without Biafra at the helm.</p>
<p>Biafra has been conspicuously absent from the music scene in recent years, choosing instead to channel his vitriol into lectures. That forum doesn't seem as suited for his talents-- the singer's blistering sarcasm has fueled many biting punk anthems, but he's not the most revelatory speaker on the campus podium circuit. Therefore, it's nice to have Biafra return to his role as a polemical punk rock gadfly.</p>
<p>The Melvins are ideal musical foils to Biafra's maniacal persona, and show an admirable willingness to subdue and camouflage their normally obtrusive sound. The band members' great admiration and respect for Biafra's work are evident in the album's malleable arrangements, which strike a perfect balance between the Melvins' grimy post-alternative metal and classic Kennedys-style California punk. Opener ""Plethysmograph"" begins with a blast of trademark Melvins sludge metal but quickly melts into a driving, dead-on Kennedys riff. The band's subtle emulation brings out the wicked humor in Biafra's sardonic description of a controversial genital device (approved by Attorney General John Ashcroft) used to administer shock therapy to perverts.</p>
<p>The album's strongest material avoids the type of somber apocalyptic weight that characterized Biafra's late-90s efforts with Lard. ""McGruff the Crime Dog"" uses the trenchcoated children's icon as a symbol for an intrusive U.S. world police force, as Melvins guitarist Buzz Osbourne's rapid metal riff captures the demented energy of Biafra's lyrics. ""Caped Crusader"" is an attack religious fanaticism, and is blanketed in Sabbath-style affected gloom. Biafra-- with the ""help"" of Ashcroft and 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta-- offers a virulent indictment of zealous anti-terror ""crusaders"": ""God is great/ God is love/ We must kill infidels!""</p>
<p>Too often, however, Biafra's political sentiment is misguided and throws the album's venomous energy off course. His bizarre indictment of airport security staffers on ""The Lighter Side of Global Terrorism"" unfairly describes the underpaid guards as sadists who get off on patting people down. On ""Yuppie Cadillac"", Biafra flays the white-collar SUV crowd in a manner that might have been somewhat provocative five years ago, but now feels antiquated.</p>
<p><i>Never Breathe What You Can't See</i> isn't exactly a return to form for Biafra-- only a return to format. He's essentially sold the same brand of hyperactive fuck-all rhetoric since his earliest days as the ultimate manic street preacher of West Coast punk. Both Biafra's sentiment and approach have dated, though, and this album lacks a needed urgency. The most telling and affecting commentary Biafra offers concerns the singer's own legacy, on ""Enchanted Thoughtfist"": ""The pressure of being taken seriously/ Breathing down on me, to keep up with my extremes/ And keep on plantin' seeds."" The song's closing mantra (""Start your own fire/ Bring the world fire"") suggests that Biafra's discontented fury still runs strong, and that he isn't about to fade away without a fight.</p></div>"|688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/688-never-breathe-what-you-cant-see-with-melvins/|7.3|David Moore

    rims of cups to make bitter medicine more palatable.   Good political pop music exploits the same loophole, and it's one that Le
    Tigre have used since their 1999 self-titled debut. <i>Le Tigre</i> was a subtle affair: Its sense of humor, its hummable hooks,
    and its light genre-hopping never compromised the band's heavy politics-- it just made them more sufferable.</p><p>
    
    As Le Tigre's major-label debut, the album had the potential to push the trio's political agenda into commercial radio country and
    ultimately turn a few unsuspecting heads.  Which is maybe why <i>This Island</i> is so frustrating: The fuzzed-out opener ""On the
    Verge"", the Beastie Boys-parody-Le Tigre George W. Rant ""Seconds"", the Aqua Teen cartoon-punk of ""Don't Drink Poison"" and ""TKO"", the
    shockingly humorless ""After Dark"", and the Mr. Scruff lounge-by-numbers incongruity ""Sixteen""-- each is immediately forgettable.</p><p>
    
    ""New Kicks"", Le Tigre's first commercial single, is a much sadder story.  In the words of their publicist, the song is ""a dance
    anthem made up of samples of anti-war speeches by Susan Sarandon, Al Sharpton, and others, punctuated by a 'Peace Up, War Down!'
    chant""--  and it sounds worse than anyone could have ever imagined.  No track could be less indicative of Le Tigre's sound: There's
    no hook, and not one of the band members even sings here.  That Universal has made this Le Tigre's first impression to mainstream
    listeners is confounding.</p><p>
    
    In contrast, the Ric Ocasek-produced ""Tell You Now"" is one of the band's best songs yet: catchy, poppy, utterly sophisticated (check
    that slick two-way monologue chorus), and steeped in Le Tigre's grrrlish sentiment.  It's unusual territory for the band-- Kathleen
    Hanna checks her squeals at the door, her cool delivery contrasting with her livid lyrics. Judging from the track, Ocasek could have
    been the key to <i>This Island</i>'s success, and it's a shame not only that they recorded just this one song with him, but that it
    wasn't even made the single.</p><p>
    
    If <i>This Island</i> failed musically but still got Le Tigre's message out, it could be counted as a minor success.  But at this
    critical juncture in their career, Le Tigre seem tame: They're neither over-the-top nor subtle-- they're merely playing it safe.
    ""Viz""-- short for ""visibility""-- predicts lesbianism's wider acceptance, but hardly goes farther than, ""They call it way too rowdy,
    I call it finally free""; the whimsical ""Nanny Nanny Boo Boo"" goes the Avenue D and Fannypack route (""If you ask us how we want it
    we'll say man-to-man/ When you go to kiss our cheeks we're gonna put out our hands"") but feels out of place on an otherwise overly
    deadpan release.</p><p>
    
    Towards the end of <i>This Island</i>, Le Tigre attempt a potentially meaningful cover of The Pointer Sisters' top 10 hit ""I'm So
    Excited"".  Like The Pointer Sisters, Le Tigre have the chance here to push the limits of female sexuality in pop, to play with sex
    and gender stereotypes, to do all the sorts of things good covers can do.  Instead, they merely pay homage to the original and then,
    halfway through the song, adopt a reggae beat for no apparent reason.  The cover ends up being merely a squandered opportunity, which
    sadly sums up <i>This Island</i> as well.</p></div>"|4706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4706-this-island/|3.3|Nick Sylvester

    British singer Vashti Bunyan.  After spending more than three decades completely off the music industry's
    grid, the past couple years have seen the angel-voiced Bunyan duet with fan Devendra Banhart on <i>Rejoicing
    in the Hands</i>, gig with Stephen Malkmus, and collaborate with both Piano Magic and Animal Collective.
    And now, as if in response to those wondering what all the fuss might be about, the Dicristina Stair label
    has finally given Bunyan's lone solo album, <i>Just Another Diamond Day</i>, its first U.S. CD release.</p><p>
    
    Produced in 1970 by the legendary Joe Boyd, <i>Just Another Diamond Day</i> has long been considered a holy
    grail for Brit-folk record collectors, with original copies of the album fetching over $1,000 at auction.
    It shouldn't take many listens to realize why it's so highly regarded; <i>Just Another Diamond Day</i> is,
    in its own humble way, nearly a thing of perfection.</p><p>
    
    The album features contributions from such folk luminaries as The Incredible String Band's Robin Williamson,
    Fairport Convention's David Swarbrick and Simon Nicol, as well as string arrangements by Robert Kirby, who
    performed the same duties for Nick Drake.  Boyd's production is impeccable, with the sound of each breath
    and string given an appropriate weight in the mix.  This is crucial because of the almost impossible
    fragility of Bunyan's voice, an instrument as lovely and delicate as a dew-covered spider's web but one
    which could easily be drowned out by over-instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    Considering the deftness of its acoustic, percussion-less songs, <i>Just Another Diamond Day</i> seems at
    times like a sonic sibling to the Boyd-produced Nick Drake albums-- albeit one that chooses fresh air and
    sunlight over Drake's depressive shadows.  Although Bunyan wrote all of the songs herself, the lyrics have
    an organic, out-of-time poetry that makes them feel more like traditional works.  Her songs reference
    neither the politics of the time nor the psychedelically refracted medievalism so prevalent in the folk-rock
    of the era-- the simple quatrains of hypnotic songs like ""Diamond Day"", ""Come Wind Come Rain"", or ""Where I
    Like to Stand"" instead consist of uncomplicated lyrics (""Just another field to plough/ Just a grain of wheat/
    Just a sack of seed to sow/ And the children eat"") that could've been written virtually any time in the past
    few centuries.</p><p>
    
    Some listeners find Bunyan's thematic emphasis on nature to be overly cloying and childlike-- especially on
    such bucolic tracks as ""Lilly Pond"" or ""Glow Worms"".  But others find themselves captivated by the sincerity
    and purity of Bunyan's pastoral vision, particularly in the subtle way she's able to portray human activities
    corresponding perfectly with the rhythms of the natural world, as though the people she encounters are just
    another feature of the landscape.  (""I'm counting the waves/ The men in the boats they wave/ To their wives
    and say/ I'm counting the hours in the day."")</p><p>
    
    And the whimsical wordplay she weaves through songs like ""Timothy Grub"" or ""Jog Along Bess"" (""Jog along
    Bess/ Hop along May/ Squeak along Blue/ It's a walk along day"") makes it easy to trace the influence she's
    exerted on contemporary artists like Banhart or Animal Collective.  But even with her reputation re-established
    and her influence deservedly spreading, it's unlikely that you'll encounter another album as charming or
    transporting as <i>Just Another Diamond Day</i> any time soon.</p></div>"|1135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1135-just-another-diamond-day/|9.0|Matthew Murphy

La Woman</i>, but the recordings still prove
    the genius of two Japanese ex-pats rocking sample racks, Russell Simins, and a reefer truck full of prime
    cut New York weird.  There's no question about it: I still know my chicken.  The duo of Yuka Honda and Miho
    Hatori only released one other LP as Cibo Matto, though they've both stayed visible in Manhattan's downtown
    scene.  Programmer and producer Honda has been particularly active recently, issuing a solo album through
    Tzadik in 2002 and teaming with Boredoms' Yoshimi P-We for <i>Flower With No Color</i> a year later.  Her
    first solo record, <i>Memories Are My Only Witness</i>, sprinkled fractured make-out music between choppy
    electronic programming and a little of Honda's former band's uniquely kicky whimsy, while the Yoshimi
    meet-up-- though a dream collabo for some-- was gentle but somewhat meandering.</p><p>
    
    Honda's second effort for Tzadik's Oracles series, <i>Eucademix</i>, is her strongest solo statement.  The
    romanticism of both <i>Memories Are My Only Witness</i> and Cibo Matto's more introspective material is
    here-- particularly in the watery keys and daydream pace of the Air-ish ""Some Things Should Be Kept Unsaid"".
    But that track also has a midsection scored by the hot fuzz of an electric guitar, illustrating Honda's
    longstanding flair for odd assemblage.  She's comfortable setting the distorted bass and screeching,
    layered solos of ""When the Monkey Kills"" next to ""Limoncello""'s detached hip-hop beats and keening violin
    sample, and supporting both with the contemplative, nearly new age piano piece ""Seed of Seed of Peach"".
    Opener ""Humming Song (Alone Together)"" is an opposite facet, weaving wordless female vocals into a pillowy,
    headache-induced lullaby.</p><p>
    
    Like most Tzadik releases, <i>Eucademix</i> is experimental, but it never turns its back on the listener.
    It even rewards those who are still lying awake thinking about a Cibo Matto reunion (um...) with ""I Dream
    About You"", on which Honda's ex-partner Miho Hatori provides vocals.  With its clopping, combat-boots-on-subway-steps beat,
    delicate guitar echoes, gender-specific chorus, and Hatori's whispery sultry vocals, the song would fit
    nicely on the second half of <i>Viva! La Woman</i>.  ""The embrace of darkness makes me feel all right,""
    Hatori playfully coos, ""when the beat takes over me...""</p><p>
    
    It would've been nice to hear a few more songs with Hatori, but the mostly instrumental <i>Eucademix</i>
    doesn't disappoint.  From the plaintive acoustic guitars and shuffling beats of ""Parallel"" through ""Twirling
    Batons in My Head""'s tense, modified techno, Honda and her fellow instrumentalists (which include Marc Ribot
    and former Cibo Matto drummer Timo Ellis) never makes us crave more vocal guest shots.  And, like most of
    Honda's work, this album has flashes of humor: ""Why Are You Lying to Your Therapist?"" asks the title of one
    spacey, wrong-speed guitar solo track, while ""Spooning With Jackknife"" is a perfect name for the closing
    cut's stuttering percussion triggers and disassembled blasts of feedback.  Honda displays an impressive
    range of experimentation on <i>Eucademix</i>, but it's her talents as a programmer, player, and producer
    that really sells the album.  Honda's music will roam stylistically, but it always hovers playfully above
    what most other producers are doing.</p></div>"|3996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3996-eucademix/|7.5|Johnny Loftus

    boys who write sestinas about them, there was another Camera Obscura record.  In those days, the wispy
    Glaswegian septet numbered merely six, and local boy-with--arab-strap-made-good Stuart Murdoch produced an
    early single (""Eighties Fan"") and arranged strings for them but wasn't yet shooting their album covers.</p><p>
    
    Upon its release, U.S. listeners could only find this fine indie pop outing while exchanging shy glances
    in particularly well-stocked imports aisle.  Thankfully, Merge has finally dusted off the group's UK
    breakthrough for American release, and although the record is narrower in scope than its follow-up--
    which hopscotches from Leonard Cohen to The Supremes-- it still sparkles.</p><p>
    
    On their charmingly understated first date, Camera Obscura hew more closely to their contemporaries than
    their 1960s influences.  Winsome, acoustic-driven songs such as ""Swimming Pool"" and ""The Sun on His Back""
    fit comfortably alongside fellow bedsit pop acts like The Guild League, The Fairways, and of course, Belle
    &amp; Sebastian.  Tracyanne Campbell's stiff-lipped vocals even evoke those of The Softies' Rose Melberg,
    particularly on ""Let's Go Bowling"" (one of the reissue's two bonus tracks, along with ""Shine Like a New
    Pin"").</p><p>
    
    Here, Camera Obscura play their teen-romance cards close to their hope chests; the line between earnestness
    and artfulness is indeed thin.  Like B&amp;S;'s best (there I go again!), the sprightly ""I Don't Do Crowds"" could
    be an anthem for Victorian Lit majors-- or an ironic pleasure for disaffected hipsters just finding ""I'm a
    Cuckoo"" via its Avalanches remix.  But more likely, it's both.  Campbell, who shares vocal duties with John
    Henderson, adds to those delicious double layers on opener ""Happy New Year"", offering this one-of-a-kind
    couplet: ""Did you know I could be a lot of fun?/ I'm aware that friendship can die young.""</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Double Feature"" waxes precious about Catherine Deneuve and winter, and ""Houseboat"" takes an
    outsider's look at the fun lovin' found in Christine McVie-penned Fleetwood Mac.  A dispute over Nancy
    Sinatra provides the chorus to ""Anti-Western"" (""I'm taking your boots off,"" Campbell retorts), and ""Pen
    and Notebook"" works in a winning Johnny Marr namedrop over halting piano, which is later joined by swirling
    orchestration that runs the risk of boring any chamber-pop Philistines still in the audience (their loss).</p><p>
    
    ""Eighties Fan""-- the single that brought Camera Obscura to the notice of John Peel-- has a drum opening
    that could have played over the <em>Lost in Translation</em> credits.  Because of its connection to Murdoch,
    it's the best-known of these early tracks but there are a half-dozen songs on <i>Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi</i>
    that are just as good.  Very few of them, however, capture the band's songwriting strengths-- placing a

    for some.  Its shrill, treble-heavy, splintering guitars and buzzsaw electronics constitute a rackety Wall
    of Sound noise that competently squats on land already settled by The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine,
    and Spacemen 3 . But whereas bands such as Spacemen 3 used primarily acoustic instrumentation and often
    drifted into murkier, jammier territory, Dead Combo's music is stiff, shrill, and loud, with no rhythmic
    give and little dynamic ambiguity.</p><p>
    
    The propulsive ""Tech Out"" and ""Come On Baby, Yeah"" have a twisted tension that comes from the band's
    motorik rhythms and use of drum machines and other electronic devices.  Atop this unflinchingly precise
    foundation are fuzzed-out guitars-- brisk, trebly, and volcanically potent.  On poppier numbers like
    ""Sunny"" and ""You Don't Look So Good"", there's even sterility to Dead Combo's attack that makes their brand
    of sonic brazenness easier to swallow than that of grubbier acts like The Icarus Line or Hot Snakes.</p><p>
    
    Oddly, <i>Dead Combo</i> also features two live tracks: ""Splinters"" and a cover of David Bowie's ""Let's
    Dance"".  It's an unusual move on a freshman outing, but the songs are among this collection's finest,
    capturing the band's monolithic (and reverb-abetted) stage presence.  On ""Let's Dance"", a rounder, clearer
    vocal performance provides the album its most melodic moment, albeit amid another requisite blizzard of
    distortion.  ""Splinters"" sees the band trying their hand at schlock-rock, and a frenzied audience greets
    song with approbation.  Dead Combo's aesthetic may not be affable-- noisy, trebly, garage-y rock 'n' roll
    is often cliche-ridden-- but there's still an art to cranking it up to 11.  Some bands stock munitions for
    years without managing to pack a wallop like this; this is a textbook example of how to do it right.</p></div>"|2584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2584-dead-combo/|7.5|Sam Ubl

    represents what I hope is the final stage in emo's devolution.  The songs have deep titles like ""Work"",
    ""Kill"", and ""Pain"".  They're about girls, girls, and (possibly) painkillers.  They range from ponderous
    ballads (""Drugs or Me"") to navel-gazing, midtempo tunes (the title track) to rockers that sound like
    watered-down versions of the band's earlier rockers (""Nothing Wrong"", ""Just Tonight"").  I guess you could
    call ""Night Drive"", with its late-period Folk Implosion beats, an example of a band ""maturing.""  But then
    singer/guitarist Jim Adkins opens his mouth: ""Do you feel bad like I feel bad?""</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, the rest of the album isn't much better.  To a drug-addled lover, Adkins croons, ""Stay with me/
    You're the one I need.""  To an apathetic lover: ""Your votes can mean something.""  To an easy lover: ""Lay
    back, baby, and we'll do this right.""  To no one in particular: ""Baby, this is who I am/ Sorry, but I can't
    just go turn off how I feel.""  If that's not bad enough, he even conjures the least-poetic expression of
    jealous ever: ""I'm sure your kiss remains employed.""</p><p>
    
    Things haven't always been quite <i>this</i> bad from Jimmy Eat World.  The best moments on earlier albums
    such as <em>Static Prevails</em> and <em>Clarity</em> weren't Shakespeare, but they communicated universes of
    longing to awkward kids.  ""The Middle"" is also an obscenely catchy bit of pop, despite the greater indie
    community's cred-conscious dismissal of it.  But there's none of that here.  <em>Futures</em> is like a
    rotten onion, revealing layer upon layer of foulness.  Musically, Jimmy Eat World have gone overboard with
    the trick they learned from U2: keep something somewhere jingling the same notes over and over again.
    Adkins' vocals are as whiny as ever, but here they sound canned as well.  And then there's the would-be
    hipster nod to Heatmiser's ""Not Half Right"" on the swooning <em>Smallville</em> balladry of ""Kill"" (""like
    your favorite Heatmiser song said/ It's just like being alone"").  Elliott Smith's only been dead for a
    year, guys-- a little respect, please.</p><p>
    
    ""I'm in love with the ordinary,"" Adkins acknowledges on ""The World You Love"".  That's not necessarily a
    bad thing; one of the year's finest album's, The Streets' <em>A Grand Don't Come for Free</em>, is kicked
    off by nothing more earth-shattering than a broken TV.  Yet there's a difference between romanticizing the
    ordinary-- a bad cell phone connection, say, or that feeling on a first date that goes really, really
    well-- and being, well, ordinary.  And it's hard to think of an album more mundane than <em>Futures</em>.</p></div>"|4262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4262-futures/|3.0|Marc Hogan

    belly and queue up hours of music to pipe gently into the womb where my unborn child gestates.  The program
    changes every night: The Beatles for lessons on love, Led Zeppelin for truth, Merzbow for fortitude.  But
    every Sunday at the time when MTV used to broadcast <i>120 Minutes</i>, I throw in the kind of music
    collected on Rhino's <i>Left of the Dial</i>, for just one reason: to turn my child into an insufferable
    hipster.</p><p>
    The music on this set influenced most everything Pitchfork slobbers on today.  The mandate of <i>Left of the
    Dial</i>-- to showcase anything that fit on college radio in the 80s-- means you'll find everything from punk
    and post-punk to synth-pop and dream-pop; it features early indie rock in all of its shades of amateurish
    enthusiasm and substance abuse.  It covers most of the bands namechecked during the post-punk resurgence--
    from Gang of Four to Throbbing Gristle to Joy Division-- and demonstrates how Bad Brains, Minor Threat, and
    The Minutemen expanded the punk world while The Replacements, R.E.M. and Beat Happening laid the groundwork
    for indie rock and Sonic Youth, Pixies, and Jane's Addiction did the same for 1990s grunge and alternative.
    But that's not all: We also get the moody atmospherics of The Church, Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, and The Cure,
    and the synth-pop stylings of Japan, Depeche Mode, and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.  <i>Left of the
    Dial</i> even has goth.  And industrial.  And, um, Faith No More.</p><p>
    The set's compilers settled on 82 bands, and their selections are comprehensive and sometimes surprising.
    You don't get Devo, but they pick a Wall of Voodoo song-- and it's not ""Mexican Radio"".  Hüsker Dü is
    better remembered today for their Bob Mould-penned tracks, but it's Grant Hart's ""Don't Want to Know If
    You Are Lonely"" that's included here.  The box is not without dirges or drags-- I forgot that Bauhaus'
    ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" was so damn long-- but the producers don't skimp on upbeat singles and jangly guitars.
    If <i>Left of the Dial</i> makes you nostalgic, it's more likely to evoke the weightlessness of youth than
    to cajole a lump in your throat.</p><p>
    But you don't judge a compilation by its hits alone, and it doesn't take long to find the set's weakness:
    sequencing.  Rhino may have the best licensing lawyers in the business, but the tracklist came straight
    from a committee.  <i>Left of the Dial</i> sounds anonymously plotless, and the second disc is littered
    with awkward segues: Ultravox's ""Vienna"" chokes the momentum from The Pretenders' ""Message of Love"", and
    the murderous chorus on Sisters of Mercy's ""This Corrosion"" steamrollers poor old XTC.  (And who <i>ends</i>
    a disc with ""Senses Working Overtime"", anyway?)  What's worse, slogging through Ministry's ""Stigmata"" after
    The Smiths' effusive ""This Charming Man"" is like having your early morning sex shattered by a street cleaner
    roaring past your window.</p><p>
    This kind of sequencing also destroys all sense of context. Normally, it's my job as a reviewer to lecture
    you about the history of The Dead Milkmen, or write a book report on The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, or at least
    explain how Bauhaus became Love and Rockets or Joy Division became New Order-- but there are too many
    stories crammed in here, and anyway, when ""Temptation"" comes on, all I think is, ""Wow, this is a <i>really
    great song</i>.""  The set could also describe the competing narratives of polished synthesizer bands and
    passion-trumps-practice guitars-- but that makes no sense either, as the two sides often stay as distant
    as rival cliques at the high school reunion.  Without a guiding principal, the dud tracks sound even weaker:
    You suspect there was only one person in the room arguing viciously to include Lone Justice's ""Ways to Be
    Wicked"", The Rain Parade's ""I Look Around"", or Faith No More's ""We Care a Lot"", and that everyone else
    just relented to shut him up.</p><p>
    Although <i>Left of the Dial</i>'s liner notes work as a cheat sheet, listening to the albums won't tell
    you anything about how these genres developed, interrelated, or collapsed; simply knowing the facts doesn't
    tell you why these songs matter.  On the other hand, maybe that's the point.  It reminds me of buying Rhino's
    <i>Beg, Scream &amp; Shout</i> box several years ago and enjoying it without knowing anything about the 1960s
    R&amp;B; singers whose work it collects.  It all just seemed to come from some magical past time when great
    music poured <i>sui generis</i> out of the radio and everybody dug it.  As for the struggles, influences,
    jagged careers, and sad ends that frame the music... maybe someday I'll read the liner notes.  My kid might
    feel the same way about <i>Left of the Dial</i> and ignore my lectures and nostalgia and just enjoy the
    songs.  And fuck it: If the music holds up, that will probably be for the best.</p></div>"|1970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1970-left-of-the-dial-dispatches-from-the-80s-underground/|8.3|Chris Dahlen

    Ghostly International-- Canadian tech-savant Solvent (Jason Amm) allows the robotic tinkering behind his
    electro-pop to intuit, flirt, and wink, humanizing his music at a time when too many producers sterilize
    theirs.  Solvent has led a manic label life, jumping from his co-owned imprint Suction to Ersatz Audio to
    Morr Music before landing at Ghostly.  In the interim, he's transformed himself into one of the industry's
    foremost techno-symphonists.</p><p>
    
    After years of shape shifting, Solvent seems to have righted himself on <i>Apples and Synthesizers</i>,
    which blends classic electro and synthpop with the punchy modernity of fractured, micro-edited beats.
    Recent single ""My Radio"" is built upon an insistent beat and revolving-door synth lines; insurgent and
    demanding, it's as intoxicating on the dancefloor as it is on the couch.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Amm creates more subtle tension: Atop ""First Step""'s pore-clogged beat and jagged landscape,
    self-help vocal fragments are strewn about with careful precision, adding a perplexing beauty to the
    elaborate, graceful track.  The beat is reminiscent of the pop-funk beauty of Mouse on Mars' recent
    <i>Radical Connector</i>, but the cacophonous Orwellian din behind the machinery speaks of DeLillo's
    supermarkets.  ""Science With Synthesizers"" locks on to the same dynamic as its synths stutter against
    its beat like mercury dropped into boiling water.  As those synths slide out of range, a cranky whiplash
    beat briefly takes center stage before relenting to blue-lit micro-beats and gurgling plinks.</p><p>
    
    Solvent's tracks are at their weakest when Amm adds vocals.  Unlike his new labelmate Matthew Dear-- who
    fuzzies his vocals with a precise shadowing that never detracted from his lyrical addition-- Amm too often
    garbles his with a vocoder.  The angular vocals on ""Think Like Us"" and ""Remote Control"" distract from Amm's
    funky backdrops, and wind up blotting tight compositions.  Fortunately, these tracks don't dissuade from
    the general appeal of <i>Apples and Synthesizers</i>, a record that-- like the child-like, offset typeface
    on its album cover-- has a retro-adoration that is as antagonistic as it is innocent.  Tilt your head and
    nod in time.</p></div>"|7782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7782-apples-and-synthesizers/|8.0|Derek Miller

    Tujiko Noriko onboard.  Excerpt from <i>Stéréotypie</i>'s press release: ""This ideal, as a conglomeration
    of homemade fantasies, seems to unveil the limitations and the obsolescence of making a fantasy of physical
    and mechanical perfection come true, and also uncovers all the excitement attached to this fantasy, by
    fulfilling obsessions about norms and evenness together with a certain imperfection.""</p><p>
<i>Stéréotypie</i>'s concept about fantasies being mistranslated yet still rewarding the artist with an
    unexpected ""perfection"" is nothing avant-garde.  It's the essence of art.  Hell, one of the most poignant
    moments in Britney Spears' legacy was caught on her <i>Live from Las Vegas</i> concert DVD when, midway
    through the lass' performance, she's dragged away by men in black leaving the spotlight to Jon Voight and
    Britney's wide-eyed sis in a nightgown by his lap.  'Ol Joe Buck then recites to her a poem about handsome
    princes, princesses, virginal purity, and the chastity belt.  And each syllable he utters is punctuated
    by a distorted hiss of 200+ decibel amplification.  Poetry translated into white noise.</p><p>
    DACM thankfully dwells on another planet.  The first release from the project's noisenik mastermind, Peter
    ""Pita"" Rehberg, was 2002's <i>Showroom Dummies</i>-- a dance piece that mainly involved models both clothed
    and nude in mannequin poses.  His music typically domesticates and sculpts cold, raw electricity.  Rehberg's
    solo work on <i>Showroom</i> drenched a few ""mainstream"" conventions of timbre in sulfuric acid.  His
    lawnmower drone treatment of a cliché trance-techno synth melody was priceless.  In <i>Stéréotypie</i>,
    his partnership with post-techno chanteuse Tujiko Noriko adds a deeper dynamic and genuine humanity to
    the DACM sound.</p><p>
<i>Stéréotypie</i> is a beauty that threatens to evaporate at anytime.  Hence, the ""perfect fantasy versus
    imperfect reality"" concept.  DACM stages an order built on rotting stilts, as almost every moment is tinged
    with scrambled data and irregular pacing.  The album's finest song, ""Vidya"", embodies that element-- tweaking
    and liquidating sunbursts of a warp-speed synth patch to create the sensation of falling up into the sky;
    an elating grace before disintegrating into the atmosphere. Similar tracks also find a balance between
    playfulness and delirium.  ""LN Start"" erupts with a thick refrigerator-drone lightly showered by microtones.
    ""Marie"" and ""Outparis Kiss"" also take such microtones and mutate them into happy accidents.  The 12-minute
    ""Birthday"" loops a Boards of Canada-caliber synth trance before vibraphones brilliantly saunter in.  Beaming
    with such pluck for at least its first 10 seconds is ""Latex"", a solo piece for latex that is akin to Tom
    Zé's classic, balloon-on-tooth experiments.  The album's weakest moment is ""Party"", a machine-groove with
    congested sinuses, looped into oblivion.</p><p>
    Besides ""Vidya"", <i>Stéréotypie</i>'s other admirably peculiar moments are when Noriko's fingerprints are
    felt. ""Angel"" is vintage Noriko, a ballad about sacrificing one's soul for love. She whispers with
    near-vampiric intimacy: ""I'll give you everything/ Even this memory.../ I dream to be what I'll never
    be.""  She drives the track's sexual tension alongside oddball guitar twangs, fractured synths, and an
    eight-mile-high bass thump.  ""Patty"" is also arresting: It features decapitated, Copacabana lounge-jazz
    that wanders in a circle as Noriko meows Japanese, suddenly uttering ""stereotype"" during a silence.
    The lyric is a nagging reminder of the album's title, and may imply that DACM's work here is
    ""stereotypical"" of so much post-techno and its habit of soiling the sweet.</p></div>"|2127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2127-stereotypie/|7.8|Cameron Macdonald

    independent music flock.  Brion boasts a pop aesthetic honed by his songwriting with The Grays and
    Jellyfish, as well as his production work with Aimee Mann and Fiona Apple, and his buoyant soundscapes--
    often bubbling with enveloping orchestral strokes and theatrical wall-of-sound presentation-- have, most
    notably, contributed to the maudlin grandeur of film directors P.T. Anderson and Michel Gondry.</p><p>
 A soundtrack is unavoidably linked to the film it accompanies, and
 <i>
  I
  <img height=""10"" src=""/images/heart.gif"" width=""11""/>
  Huckabees
 </i>
 -- a sprawling
    amalgam of shambolic character studies and psychobabble centered on a neurotic environmentalist's relationship
    with his ""existential detectives""-- is so frantic that most scenes don't lend themselves to further elaboration.
    This might explain why Brion's
 <i>
  Huckabees
 </i>
 score is more understated and unobtrusive than most of his
    work; his penchant for underscoring quiet intensity is at odds with the film's series of shouting matches.
    Brion unexpectedly falls back on his talents as a singer/songwriter, composing five new ""vocal pop rock""
    songs that have little relation to the film itself, aside from the obligatory closing credits OST tie-in.</p><p>
 Brion's pop songs may have comprised an interesting EP, but they feel arbitrary and scattered alongside the
    film's score.  ""Revolving Door"" and ""Get What It's About"" are indebted to Elliott Smith and Aimee Mann's
    wry, self-deprecating ballads.  The clear highlight is ""Knock Yourself"", a brief but enjoyable jangle-pop
    excursion accented with Brion's trademark orchestral flourishes.
</p><p>
 Brion admits that most of this material was amassed from pieces he composed years ago, pieces which seemed
    to ""click"" when added to corresponding scenes.  However, much of the soundtrack's material is weaker than
    his later work, and several tracks feel like embryonic versions of future compositions.  The film's main
    theme, ""Monday"", derives its power from the same template that forged
 <i>
  Punch-Drunk Love
 </i>
 's woozy,
    lilting waltz.  The piece is the score's strongest and most memorable instrumental.  It gracefully bookends
    the film and the album despite intermittent missteps on both fronts, but it still feels strangely anonymous
    in the context of Brion's recent career peaks.
</p>
<p>
 For the most part, Brion manages to subdue his typically conspicuous arrangements to temper the film's
    frenzied momentum.  Its bumbling detectives are paired with a breezy Mancini-esque theme that subtly
    emphasizes the
 <i>
  Pink Panther
 </i>
 slapstick of the detective subplot.  Atmospheric pizzicato strings,
    liberally applied bell chimes, and angelic piano glissandos allow tracks like the ethereal ""Cubes"",
    molasses-thick ""JB's Blues"", and lounge-y ""True to Yourself"" to elevate the film's subjective hyperrealism
    without seeming overbearing.
</p>
<p>
 Brion has expressed dissatisfaction with most contemporary film soundtracks, and though his own work is a
    veritable antidote to the calculated emotion-extraction mechanisms of so many Hollywood film scores,
 <i>
  I
  <img height=""10"" src=""/images/heart.gif"" width=""11""/>
  Huckabees
 </i>
 marks the first perceivable softening of Brion's characteristic audaciousness.  Though
    he hasn't made any concessions to the trappings of a standard-issue Hollywood soundtrack-- and the one-two
    punch of
 <i>
  Punch-Drunk Love
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
 </i>
 set a high mark to
    follow-- Brion's
 <i>
  Huckabees
 </i>
 compositions are too often diversionary and fall prey to stagnation,
    making this a frequently inspired but ultimately uneven retread.

    unintentional.  Perhaps Mos Def, still lit after a performance of <i>Top Dog/Underdog</i>, wandered into
    the studio during Living Colour's reunion jamboree, recorded five minutes of talking, and walked out
    with some sort of leather-induced amnesia.  How else to explain the jarring transition between Raphael
    Saadiq's floating keys on ""The Boogie Man Song"" and Dr. Know's hyper-machismo axe-wielding on ""Freaky
    Black Greetings""?  How to explain an awkward, ill-advised stumble through Durst-style rap-rock?  After
    exactly five years of waiting for the follow-up to 1999's magnificent <i>Black on Both Sides</i>, Mos Def
    opens by rehashing the final minutes of ""Rock 'n' Roll"" with the less-than-subtle assistance of Black Jack
    Johnson.  Mos, say it ain't so.</p><p>
    
    Curiously, despite Mos' on-the-mark vocalizing about the neglected acknowledgment of the Afro-American
    influence on rock, he chose the arguably <i>least</i> ""black"" form to express himself.  Granted, more
    African-American creative input in modern rock would be a wonderful thing-- and Mos' attempt is laudable--
    but as he says, ""I ain't try to fuck with Limp Bizkit,"" suggesting that rap and rock are two very different
    beasts whose collusion could be disastrous.  Yet both ""Freaky Black Greetings"" and ""Zimzallabim"" borrow
    heavily from the <i>Chocolate Starfish</i> playbook.  Suffice to say, Mos' cry, ""We show you how to really
    make a moshpit bounce"" is unconvincing at best.</p><p>
    
    ""War"" regurgitates a similar tune, adding a fairly benign critique of its titular subject, depressingly
    offering the impression that Mos believes a loud message makes an acceptable substitute for a thoughtful
    one.  On the record's rock-tinged tracks, Know's overpowering licks seem to render a stop payment on Mos'
    creativity.  ""Life Is Real"", for example, finds a terminal case of logorrhea infecting an uncharacteristically
    awful Mos verse: ""My whole life is ill/ My whole life is real/ Mornings, noons, nights/ Birthdays, work days,
    holidays, funerals.""  What's more, Know's material fails to connect thematically or musically to the rest
    of the album, causing an unfortunate fit of dysrhythmia.</p><p>
    
    It's unfortunate that a phenom like ""Sex, Love &amp; Money""-- with its fat Dick Tracy horns, whimpering jungle
    flute, and marching band percussion-- is lost in the melee.  Here, Mos tantalizes us with a glimpse of his
    past ebullience as he hums: ""Lay back and relax your mind/ About to double the dosage in the half-time/
    Master physical mastermind.""  Likewise, ""The Panties"" and ""Modern Marvel"" revel in the sleepy genius of

    of Hearts Era</em>, is a bit misleading.  It seems to zero in on one facet of a copious output, when in fact
    the Ace of Hearts era comprises the bulk of Burma's recordings.  Except for this year's new reunion album
    <em>OnOffOn</em>, Rick Harte's tiny Boston-based label released all of Burma's records: the ""Academy Fight
    Song"" / ""Max Ernst"" single (1980), the <em>Signals, Calls, and Marches</em> EP (1981), the <em>Vs.</em> LP
    (1982), and the posthumous live album <em>The Horrible Truth About Burma</em> (1985).  In those years, Burma
    didn't just cobble together a Frankenstein's monster of post-punk, free jazz, avant-garde psychedelia,
    and Krautrock; they spliced these genres together at the cellular level to create brilliantly dynamic punk
    rock.</p><p>
    
    Burma's songs have held up remarkably well over the decades, and their influence on bands from Sonic Youth
    to R.E.M. to Interpol cannot be overstated.  But a retrospective must be gauged by different standards than
    original material.  The bottom line: Is it necessary?  There's no previously unreleased material included
    here, and the omission of ""Max Ernst""-- a Burma classic that helped initiate the titular Ace of Hearts era--
    is befuddling.  And since Ryko already remastered and reissued Burma's entire catalog in 1996, all of their
    records are easy to find.  For Burma fans, it's redundant.</p><p>
<em>Gun</em> is therefore either for Burma neophytes who want to get a feel for the band's style and evolution,
    or for those who'd rather have a Burma sampler platter than shell out for three entrees.  Arranged chronologically,
    its first five tracks are from the meticulously produced <em>Signals</em> EP (the remastered version of which
    also contained Burma's debut single), among which are their most famous anthems, ""That's When I Reach for
    My Revolver"" and ""Academy Fight Song"".  The next nine songs are from the artier and almost monophonically
    recorded <em>Vs.</em>, which sought to replicate the chaos of their live performances.  The final two tracks
    are from the live document <em>The Horrible Truth About Burma</em>, which memorialized what the band thought
    would be their final performance. </p><p>
    
    So considering this comp is for newbies, it's still prudent to ask: Who were Mission of Burma?  Unlike many
    of their punk rock peers, Roger Miller and Clint Conley were trained musicians but they also liked to thrash.
    Both proclivities would inform Burma's music, as would the tension between Miller's brainy guitar compositions
    (see the serpentine menace of the Miller-penned ""Trem Two"") and Conley's anthemic, poppier instincts (see
    his classic soft/loud fist-pumper ""That's When I Reach for My Revolver""). After quitting their art-rock
    band Moving Parts, they linked up with drummer Peter Prescott and visionary tape-looper Martin Swope to
    form Mission of Burma in 1979.  Simply put, they played minimal songs in complicated ways, filling them
    with both intellectual fodder and physical exhilaration. </p><p>
    
    Burma was a postmodern art-rock band in the truest sense.  They were heavily influenced by the tenets of
    Dadaism, and the liner notes of <em>Signals</em> ripped their enigmatic, lyrical Mobius strips (""the beginning,
    at the ending"") out of context and arrayed the words in alphabetical order. Swope was a human analog sampler,
    manipulating improvised tape loops while hidden offstage during Burma's cacophonous live performances: a
    countervailing voice turning the music against itself.  ""I'm not your Academy,"" was Burma's clarion call,
    which echoed Dada's directive to break the Academy's stranglehold on the arts.  But despite these intellectual
    tics, the songs from <em>Signals</em> are a reminder that Burma was, at heart, a furious, melodic punk band--
    best evidenced by the one-note throb of ""Fame and Fortune"" and skittering power chords of ""(This Is Not a)
    Photograph"".</p><p>
    
    While the hardcore scene got dumber, Burma kept getting smarter.  By the time they recorded the more abstruse
    <em>Vs.</em>, its title rang true-- Burma seemed to fly against the accepted hardcore mores of the day.  The
    <em>Vs.</em> tracks collected here retain Burma's hypnotic drive, but weave it through more meditative and
    difficult structures.  The tortured, plodding anthem ""Dead Call"" and the imploding chords of ""Weatherbox""
    reveal themselves more slowly than many punk fans accustomed to instant gratification were willing to
    tolerate.  Burma finally succumbed after the <em>Vs.</em> tour, when Miller's tinnitus became dangerously
    acute.  Considering the ringing harmonics and piercing feedback that decorated his stage performances--
    displayed here on live versions of ""Peking Spring"" and ""Go Fun Burn Man""-- one wonders whether he was
    externalizing the noise in his head.</p><p>
    
    Mission of Burma wasn't the only classic post-punk band that doggedly pursued their vision to the point of
    obsession; in fact, that trait was a staple of the genre.  Rather, the difference between Burma and like-minded
    art-punks like Pere Ubu and The Pop Group was that Burma's particular vision happened to perfectly align with
    the precarious axis between intellectualism and instinctive songcraft.  Instead of trudging ever deeper into
    their penchant for dissonance, or eventually dropping it in favor of more immediately palatable pop/punk, Burma
    treaded the divide like a highwire without a net for the duration of their brief career.  Their legend is only
    enhanced by the fact that they disbanded at the peak of their creative powers.</p></div>"|5575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5575-a-gun-to-the-head-a-selection-from-the-ace-of-hearts-era/|9.0|Brian Howe

    The band barely lasted two years, released only one album (which Columbia's marketing department sat on its
    hands to promote), and ended up a cult favorite that would later be speculated as a phantom influence for
    the Krautrock sound.  But 36 years after its release, USA's self-titled album still stands above the work
    of most of their Monterey-era, psych-rock peers, and this long-awaited reissue tacks on 10 tracks' worth
    of audition tapes, B-sides, and alternate takes.</p><p>
    
    The band's deft addition of electronic noise and modulation into what would otherwise be soundtracks for
    the Beach Boys' California or ham 'n' eggs Anglo-rock was several years ahead of its time.  Former UCLA
    ethnomusicology instructor Joseph Byrd concocted miracles with musique concrete-style tape collages and white
    noise blurts that veered in and out of the songs like uninvited but still welcome guests.  He also tackled
    a dub-like mixology of tape delays and ring-modulated fade-outs and, best of all, distorted and punch-drunk
    synthesizers that sound indistinguishable from electric guitars.  This was a fresh approach to rock from a
    unique group of musicians: UCLA students who had studied Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen but, as Byrd's liner
    notes claim, were ""ignorant"" of rock roots.  And, although the band does indulge a few moments of awestruck
    discovery of their instruments' capabilities, the noise generally works with the music rather than simply
    being fodder from badge-wearing freaks tying to spook the Organization Man.</p><p>
    
    If USA had an anthem, it was ""The American Metaphysical Circus"".  The track opens with a pleasantly disorienting
    hodgepodge of sampled John Philip Souza marches and Byrd's faithful kiddie-baiting Ringling Bros. calliope
    melodies before chanteuse Dorothy Moskowitz arrives with her herbal tea-watered croon, carefully enunciating
    like a three-nights-of-sleep-deprived mother's lullaby.  Meanwhile, electric violinist/ring modulator foreman
    Gordon Marron emits aurora borealis streaks of police siren wails and bassist Rand Forbes keeps the music
    resting its head on a bar table all night long.</p><p>
    
    Byrd's free-association lyrics throughout the album are generally LSD journal entries (e.g. ""Lemonous petals,
    dissident play/ Tasting of ergot/ Dancing by night, dying by day""), satirical toasts to the Good Life (""I
    got a split level house with a wonderful view, sugar""), or phonetics intended for a jigsaw fit into the
    music (the Latin choral chant that opens ""Where Is Yesterday"").  ""Hard Coming Love"" is a conventional
    rave-up that would've faded into background at an all-night, acid test show were it not for the UFO-like
    synth that mysteriously flies through the song's intermissions.</p><p>
    
    That said, some of the album's synthesizer works haven't aged well and are stigmatized by the ""B-flick
    sound effects"" tag that magnifies the wrinkles on so many electro-acoustic pieces from the analog years.
    The tribal drum whomp that opens the go-go trance number ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" is pockmarked
    by a laser-gun misfire that might've cued a Playboy bunny in Pocahontas drag to jump through a paper wall
    and shake it for the camera after Hugh Hefner announced his solidarity with the American Indian Movement
    on <i>The Mike Douglas Show</i>.  The patchouli-sprayed ballads ""Cloud Song"" and ""Love Song for the Dead
    Che"" both bloom with rich, East Indian-inspired piano and string melodies, and still breathe without any
    electronic fingerprints.  On the other hand, the pots 'n' pans-banging hootenanny ""I Won't Leave My Wooden
    Wife for You, Sugar"" is relieved by its jump-edit to a New Orleans slapstick jazz coda.</p><p>
    
    The bonus tracks included on this reissue indicate that USA may have aspired to gain prominence in both
    the mainstream and the avant-garde.  ""Osamu""-- with its drone-minimalism rooted in composer La Monte Young's
    Theater of Eternal Music and sparse, dribbling kabuki rhythms-- is the band's most abstract, non-commercial
    moment.  In stark contrast are the Fillmore East-goes-""American Bandstand"" pop tune ""No Love to Give"" and
    the AOR-ready, organ-pop of ""Perry Pier"".  These songs exhibit one of the reasons why USA broke up so quickly:
    Byrd wrote that he wanted the band to go ""harder,"" while Moskowitz preferred the ""softer"" route.  That yin
    and yang is uncannily blended in the band's magnum opus, ""The American Way of Love"".  The three-part medley
    first thrashes out dirty psych-blues with Byrd advertising the wonders of being a John for cross-dressing
    prostitutes.  Then the music bleeds into a radio station playing escapist Bacharach-pop or ""California
    good-time music,"" before brilliantly concluding with a sputtering music machine randomly firing samples of
    the album's previous melodies and utterances.  Sadly, too few heard this music when it was first released.</p></div>"|8385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8385-united-states-of-america/|8.9|Cameron Macdonald

In the
    rock 'n' roll classroom, they're the detention-bound misfits in the back row-- ain't concerned with learnin'
    nothin' but a good time-- and <i>1+1=Ate</i>, their second full-length, is an album of punk spitballs targeted
    at the back of your head.  They've scrawled ""KISS"" on all of their notebooks, but their primary allegiance
    is to Cheap Trick.  While fellow pop-punk bands like Sum 41, Good Charlotte, and Blink-182 are wearing their
    newly found maturity like a school uniform, The Knockout Pills wallow in arrested development, despite the
    fact that their back-cover photo depicts them as late-thirtysomethings.</p><p>
    
    Featuring members of the Weird Lovemakers, Los Federales, and The Resonars, The Knockout Pills hail from
    Tucson, AZ, home of Calexico and Linda Ronstadt.  There's no high-desert harmony or Mariachi influence
    in their sound, though-- these not-so-juvenile delinquents play a brand of pop/punk that could have emanated
    from any corner of the country.  Rock 'n' roll has many universals-- fast tempos, loud guitars, barking
    vocals, and attitude-- and The Knockout Pills cram them all into <i>1+1=Ate</i>.</p><p>
    
    Guitarist Matt Rendon and bassist Travis Spillers trade off yapping vocals throughout the album, and trying
    to distinguish between them is only slightly less futile than trying to figure out what exactly they're saying.
    Their indecipherability never becomes a liability; instead, it only reinforces the album's one-take spontaneity
    and the exuberance of its stay-young mission.  A few distinct words even rise from the rumble.  On ""Stab
    Wound Baby"", they sing about a guy who wanted to be a doctor but instead ""now he's comin' home in a box.""
    ""Summertown Rundown"" laments the Arizonan heat: ""We got three more months of 110 degrees.""</p><p>
    
    The dozen songs on <i>1+1=Ate</i> all start with a prologue that introduces the main guitar riff, settle
    into a verse/chorus/verse structure, and are punctuated by a shout-along bridge and short guitar solo--
    and all of them are over and done within three minutes.  The Knockout Pills spruce up the songs with
    flourishes like the whoa-oh-oh chorus of ""Stab Wound Baby"" and the barreling piano on ""Not for Nothing"".
    And in addition to handclaps and a squealing audience, ""Summertown Rundown"" layers a surf-guitar solo
    over falsetto la-la-la's as it leads into a second searing solo.  <i>1+1=Ate</i> may not be exceedingly
    original, but that doesn't mean it's not inspired-- or that its not good, solid fun.</p></div>"|4586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4586-11ate/|7.7|Stephen M. Deusner

    and neo-classical composition first shown on his contributions to Thirsty Ear's ongoing <i>Blue Series</i>.
    Adhering to the methods established on 2002's <i>Nu Bop</i> and last year's <i>Equilibrium</i>, Shipp
    combines his acoustic piano with William Parker's bass, Gerald Cleaver's live drums, and the varied
    electronic hi-jinx of Chris Flam.  The resulting mix avoids the wilder extremes of both free jazz and
    abstract electronica, and instead takes a more moderate scoop from the middle of each.</p><p>
    
    This neither-fish-nor-fowl approach has been decried as populist pandering in some quarters-- particularly
    by those with fond memories of Shipp's more radical, molten work on records like David S. Ware's <i>Cryptology</i>--
    but to his credit, Shipp clearly doesn't give a good goddamn what his listeners might expect of him.  He
    resolutely plows forward on <i>Harmony and Abyss</i>, leaving jazz orthodoxy further in his rearview.  In
    fact, only one track here-- the burbling, pointillist ""Invisible Light""-- contains what can easily be
    identified as improvisation.  Otherwise, the album sounds carefully and almost rigidly composed, with
    Shipp's repetitive, chunky chords meticulously mapping out the shades and melodies of each song in order
    to ensure that no one gets lost peeking down any side streets.</p><p>
    
    The album contains Shipp's most seamless integration of acoustic instruments and electronics yet, and its
    peak moments fall well outside simple categorization.  ""Virgin Complex"", with its swirl of bowed strings,
    electronic vapor, and lyrical piano recalls the avant chamber-pop of Rachel's <i>Systems/Layers</i> as
    much as it does any jazz.  Parker's nimble bass drives the quietly propulsive and majestic ""Blood 2 the
    Brain"", a multi-faceted track that wouldn't sound out of place on a DJ Shadow release.  Elsewhere, Flam
    takes to the foreground, as on ""String Theory"" where Shipp's piano drifts unmoored through a wilderness
    of mysterious, foreboding whirrs and thuds.  Best of all might be ""Amino Acid"" where Flam's electronically
    generated hoofbeats and thunderclaps effortlessly link onto Cleaver's dexterous percussion to form a woozy,
    lurching conga line beneath Shipp's inverted Monk-esque pounding.</p><p>
    
    Strange as it may sound, though, the album's fussy, studied flawlessness is its chief flaw.  The opening
    ""Ion"", for example, sounds as though all distinguishing fingerprints have been deliberately wiped away,
    leaving Shipp at the piano running restrained, depersonalized scale exercises over a stiff, boxy breakbeat.
    It's the sort of generic, unobtrusive piece that seems intended to not startle the customers down at
    Starbucks.  Such antiseptic moments are rare on <i>Harmony and Abyss</i>, but even so, it's a bit disappointing
    to see such adventurous players operating within a format where so little seems to have been left to chance.
    Shipp should now feel completely secure in his ability to unify all these disparate musical elements; maybe
    next time he'll feel freer to air things out and really tear the roof off.</p></div>"|7120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7120-harmony-and-abyss/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

    stupidly obvious, but ""sad"" still stands as the single most accurate label ever slapped onto any of the
    late singer/songwriter's records.  Smith's melancholy is big, pervasive and suffocating: see strummed chords
    and meekly mewed verses coated in thick, gloppy layers of heartbreak, lyrics hanging heavy with cold defeat,
    vocals seeped in doom.  Even the simplicity of Smith's songs can be oddly disheartening-- the pretty bits
    always conceal grim, prickly underbellies, with Smith's melodic lightness tempered by the very worst kind
    of self-alienation.</p><p>
    
    Pop music has enjoyed a long and tenuous relationship with sadness-as-aesthetic-anchor, and Elliott Smith's
    role in that lineage was obvious from the start.  It was forever preserved the moment that an obviously
    misplaced Smith stumbled onto the Academy Awards stage sporting an awkward, ill-fitting white suit.  Now,
    nearly a year after his presumed suicide, Elliott Smith has come to occupy a painfully specific spot in
    our collective pop memory, curled up alongside spiritual brethren Kurt Cobain and Nick Drake-- all somber
    songwriters who realized their artistic ends in hideously relevant ways, fulfilling every last one of the
    dismal prophecies they wrote themselves into.  And, as with Cobain and Drake, the most devastating part of
    Elliott Smith's death wasn't the knife slammed deep into his chest, but the bland inevitability of that
    motion-- how nobody was surprised, how things felt so ""validated,"" how it was disgustingly appropriate,
    how we were all just waiting for it.</p><p>
    
    Unsurprisingly, <i>From a Basement on the Hill</i>-- Smith's posthumous sixth solo album-- doesn't break
    form: Released uncomfortably close to the one-year anniversary of his death, the album is riddled with
    helpless proclamations and self-incriminating taunts, clanging guitars and foggy, jumbled arrangements.
    Like nearly all of Smith's records, <i>From a Basement</i> covers his despair in sweet, perky, folk-pop
    kisses; and yet the album is still the saddest thing you'll hear all year.  Smith's gloom may be romanticized
    into gold, but what's ultimately most harrowing about his unhappiness is its nastiness-- and that same
    gritty, uncompromising accuracy is also what makes his records so impossibly urgent, so uncomfortable and
    desperate.  Reality is splattered all over <i>From a Basement on the Hill</i>-- dissonant guitars that
    sometimes coalesce and sometimes clash, vocals that flit from beautiful to strained, lyrics that range
    from clever to pedantic, production choices that hop maniacally from right to wrong.</p><p>
    
    For whatever reason, Smith's happier moments have always felt a little meaner than his darkest.  They're
    somehow more smirking and cruel, as if they'd been put in place as pure provocation.  Even the lightest
    tracks here (see the excellent ""King's Crossing"", or the barely-there ""Memory Lane"") are bogged down by
    their own sense of inevitability, or maybe by our own-- it's almost impossible not to judge <i>From a
    Basement on the Hill</i> without first acknowledging the complicated context of its release, cringing at
    its song titles, and promptly biting back presumptive words like ""foreshadowing.""</p><p>
    
    Supposedly, Smith had finished most of the work on <i>From a Basement</i> before his death last October,
    and the completed tracks were posthumously compiled by his immediate family and mixed by one-time girlfriend/present-day
    Jicks member Joanna Bolme and longtime producer Rob Schnapf (""final production"" is credited only to ""Elliott's
    family and friends"").  And perhaps surprisingly, <i>From a Basement on the Hill</i> is perfectly coherent
    and cohesive, without any sense of being slapped together from half-finished parts.  The record even boasts
    a classic Smith opener, the booming and majestic ""Coast to Coast"", which swells in and out in a haze of
    guitar ping and found sound murmurs.  Collaborating again with former Heatmiser bandmate (and current Quasi
    member) Sam Coomes, ""Pretty (Ugly Before)"" weds tinkling piano with goofy guitar bits and lyrics that are
    somehow equally disheartened and optimistic (""Sunshine/ Been keeping me up for days/ There's no nighttime/
    It's only a passing phase"").</p><p>
    
    Still, the most disheartening thing about <i>From a Basement on the Hill</i> is its plainness-- it's neither
    a perfect record (and not one of Smith's best) nor the kind of colossal disaster that could be angrily pinned
    on money-hungry handlers and desperate fans.  It's likely that Elliott Smith will be resurrected and rediscovered
    countless times over, and that his suicide will become as big a part of his legacy as his discography, feeding
    the mythology, informing the songs.  But while <i>From a Basement on the Hill</i> will certainly have a
    place in that tradition, its impact will prove a stark contrast to his most affecting work.</p></div>"|7270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7270-from-a-basement-on-the-hill/|7.2|Amanda Petrusich

At a regal and
    self-deprecating 73 years old, the actor has had plenty of time to marinate in his own persona.  Shatner
    established his ironclad, overblown style as the heroic interplanetary paramour Captain James T. Kirk on
    the short-lived 1960s TV series ""Star Trek"".  His placement in syndication purgatory and the pop culture
    zeitgeist of the latter half of the 20th century was reinforced by his turn beside the impossibly-hot-for-a-cop
    Heather Locklear in the equally short-lived ""T.J. Hooker"".</p><p>
    
    His recording career is lesser-known.  In 1968, Shatner made <i>The Transformed Man</i>, a surreal, comical
    work that placed ridiculous readings of pop hits (""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", ""Mr. Tambourine Man"")
    alongside recitations of selected Shakespeare passages.  Despite Shatner's serious intentions, the album
    was received as pure kitsch, and the cover songs ended up on a 1988 Rhino novelty comp called <i>Golden
    Throats: The Great Celebrity Sing-Off!</i></p><p>
    
    A few years ago, Shatner the Singer resurfaced on ""In Love"", an intriguing, well-received cut from Ben
    Folds' Fear of Pop project.  Folds enlisted Shatner based on his childhood fascination with <i>The
    Transformed Man</i>, and the two began a friendship that has now culminated with <i>Has Been</i>, a
    collection of 11, um, pieces-- spoken word vignettes, theatrical readings, droll musings-- so out of leftfield
    that any discussion of the album will necessarily stray from the field of music criticism and into pop
    culture analysis.  While this humble music publication is hardly the platform to debate the merits and
    impact of irony in modern art, I will say that I'm glad that Shatner decided to make this music now.  It's
    so confusing, enthralling, sincere, profound, and trite that it's nothing short of a mirror to society's
    own incongruities.  Which, really, is quite an achievement.</p><p>
    
    Folds' easygoing way with thematic contradiction-- smug sincerity, for one example; nerd chic for another--
    makes him the ideal musical foil for Shatner's full-frontal Shatnerizing (it's a word, google it).  Whether
    you know him from his early work, his hammy Priceline TV spots, or his recent <i>tour de force</i> as legal
    eagle Denny Crane on ""The Practice"" and its spinoff ""Boston Legal"", you know what I'm talking about.  William
    Shatner's histrionic.  Verbal.  Cadence is the stuff of.  Legend and.  Many.  A comedy routine.  And
    fortunately, he never deigns himself to sing.  But it's the fact that he's in on the joke these days that
    elevates him to some kind of groundbreaking standard-bearer of self-aware irony and innate honesty.</p><p>
    
    Can those two elements co-exist?  Remarkably, they do on <i>Has Been</i>-- even after multiple listens.
    For an album I approached ready to shrug off as sheer novelty, its humor and candor give it a fair amount
    of staying power.  Turn up the burlesque swing of ""Ideal Woman"" or the title track's goofy spaghetti western
    rant at a party and watch the room go silent.  Shatner's voice is naturally magnetic, lending alternating
    gravitas and levity; his delivery is that of an accomplished actor, so with only a slight deviation of
    emphasis he can shift from bombastic to sullen.</p><p>
    
    But bombast is what he does best.  His power-pop cover of Pulp's ""Common People"" has Joe Jackson going
    grandiose with Shatner and a chorus with upwards of 60 vocalists.  His duet with Henry Rollins on ""I Can't
    Get Behind That"" is pure raging comedy set over abstract guitar screams from King Crimson's Adrian Belew,
    and his riff on mortality on the jazzy ""You'll Have Time"" is plainly hilarious.  ""That's Me Trying"" might
    sum up the work best, with Folds' plaintive piano matched with acoustic guitar as Shatner tells a story of
    a deadbeat dad trying to make good.  The song was written by <i>High Fidelity</i> and <i>About a Boy</i>
    novelist Nick Hornby, and stays aloof and alluring with convoluted pathos and inadvertent wit.</p><p>
    
    However, when Shatner dips into the saccharine jar, things don't fare as well.  ""It Hasn't Happened Yet""
    is maudlin and dull, and the tragic story of ""What Have You Done?"" is too depressing to belong on an
    otherwise lighthearted album.  Still, there's a great amount of range here, both musically and lyrically,
    and Folds and Shatner take it all in stride.  Weird, I know, but it works.</p></div>"|7781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7781-has-been/|7.5|Jonathan Zwickel

People differ on exactly what the nature of that war is, where we should be fighting it, and
    how effective our current tactics are, but people are dying in more than one country, violence is a daily
    headline, and the political discourse in this country inevitably strays to it-- even as we try to focus on
    other things.  It makes sense that the art of our times should reflect this basic fact, and indeed, it's
    begun to; from novelists like Philip Roth to aging rock stars like R.E.M., basic questions of American
    values and power are being addressed.  America is polarized-- perhaps moreso than at any other time in the
    post-Vietnam era-- and so it happens that even artists whose art is devoid of words or open sentiment take
    pains to politicize what they do, and Asheville, NC's Ahleuchatistas are no exception.  For the second time
    in less than a year, they've released an album of confrontational, heady instrumentals that reflect the
    conflict and violence of our era, and packaged it in provocative artwork.</p><p>
    
    The ""tistas"" portion of the bandname is a reference to Mexico's indigenous peoples' Zapatista movement,
    named originally for would-be Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata.  (He never did affect his desired
    coup.)  The band means this reference as a sort of shoutout to oppressed people around the world and
    throughout history-- indeed the ""Ahleucha"" portion of their name comes from the title of an improvisational
    piece by a black American, Charlie Parker-- and the cover of this album puts their thoughts about the
    current war in Iraq, on display for anyone who cares to look.  Painted by Courtney Chappell, it's a powerful,
    cubistically fractured skyline (presumably the mosque-dotted profile of Baghdad) being bombed by an F-15,
    as obviously Muslim women contort in agony in the foreground.  The primary subject matter of the image
    actually shouldn't cause much controversy in my view-- is there anyone with a conscience who doesn't
    sympathize with the poor civilians caught in the middle of all of this?-- but the implication of an
    essentially American-perpetrated atrocity might not play terribly well to those not on the left.</p><p>
    
    Okay, okay, so the guys in the trio aren't thrilled that we're in Iraq, but what does that have to do with
    their instrumental music?  Well, everything and nothing.  Out of context, it's precise, brutal troublefunk--
    pointilistic free jazz for the scrapyard set and not for ears that are too attached to consonance.  <i>In</i>
    context, it's bombs over Baghdad, firefights, and blood running in the streets.  You don't have to read it
    solely as a critique of American force, either-- it works just as well as a sonic allegory for the daily
    atrocities visited upon the Iraqi populace by various factions of the insurgency.</p><p>
    
    Ahleuchatistas may play heavy, challenging music with a lot of baggage, but they keep their approach
    steadfastly clear: Distortion is absent from both the bass of Derek Poteat and the guitar of Shane
    Perlowin, and Sean Dail is a brilliantly economical drummer, reminiscent in his best moments of Bill
    Bruford in his King Crimson prime.  Poteat and Perlowin play a game of strike and counterstrike, mimicking
    war's sick spiral, and the intensity level is ridiculously high for the album's full 28-minute duration.
    It's a concise and wickedly effective concentration and the <i>sturm und drang</i> that they stretched
    twice as far on their debut, <i>On the Culture Industry</i>.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, when listening to <i>The Same and the Other</i>, you can take the Wassily Kandinsky approach--
    abstract art is concrete, he famously insisted-- or you can take the more tempting and likely approach and
    read it as an allegory for contemporary strife and suffering.  After all, even much abstract art carries
    a title and a story (pretense, if you will), and ignoring those things limits the experience to a viewing
    exercise.  On that score, this album is a powerful statement and an explosive piece of music.</p></div>"|432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/432-the-same-and-the-other/|8.0|Joe Tangari

Duo505's ice cream truck
    melodies are usually repeated ad nauseam until the guys themselves grow bored and attach a magnet to their
    machines.  This recalls a 1988 <i>Village Voice</i> piece by rock criticism's great over-intellectualizer
    Greil Marcus.  In ""Punk Is Where You Find It"", Marcus remembers opening an Absolut Vodka ad's insert in a
    <i>New Yorker</i> and then hearing a tiny music box that would tinkle ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas""...
    for 48 hours.  He wrote: ""Imagine tens of thousands of undetectable music boxes... all secreted in the
    crevices of skyscrapers, in the cracks of telephone poles, stuck under bus seats... (behind the presidential
    seal the next time there's a televised White House news conference).""  He concluded, ""Imagine 'You Are My
    Sunshine' and 'When a Man Loves a Woman' turning the whole country into one vast theater for the aural
    itch of a song you can't get out of your head.""</p><p>
    
    While it's doubtful that Vienna's Duo505 (B. Fleischmann and Herbert Weixelbaum) share that plan for global
    terrorism, they still create infectious and defiantly sentimental synth-pop that could haunt your neurons
    to kingdom come.  Their weapon: the MC-505 Groovebox-- Roland's miracle synthesizer that combines the past
    models that made so much techno, house, and hip-hop possible, and now makes said genres ridiculously easy
    to produce.  Duo505 employs two Grooveboxes to manufacture 8-bit cuddlecore ditties that could've been ripe
    for run 'n' jump Nintendo games and ""Heathcliff"" cartoons.  And while their formula grows cumbersome over
    the course of seven songs-- this is the point of music-box subversion after all-- the band's execution
    still warrants repeated listens.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Tsip Tsap"", first teases with bombastic, Mouse on Martian beats until in kicks a melody straight
    from a wedding video intro.  Alas, instead of the anticipated excursion into nasty breakcore, we get artificial
    sweetener.  The flower-for-you-and-now-mate-with-me-too ballad is repeated for five minutes until the end
    when the song's DAT recording was possibly dropped in a glass of acidic Coca-Cola.  There, the keyboards
    are suddenly de-tuned and choke to death on garbled data.  ""Nochwas"" drinks from the same bottle, but
    thumps a prime StairMaster beat.  ""Lsdj08"" has a keen bounce with a tubular, chirp-pop rhythm and melodies
    made rad by buzzing textures.  One could picture this tune getting looped on a skatepark's PA in a move
    devised by the local city council to promote civility among its delinquents.  Many noses could get bloodied,
    but at least the music is something that even a born-again, Pentecostal mom could like.</p><p>
    
    Less godly is ""Wenig"", with its disintegrating lullabies and Tourette's-addled noises adding a refreshing
    dynamic.  Like that track, there are a few songs that break the monotony and sell this record.  ""Toru Okada""
    is a shoegazer epic that begins as a humble guitar ballad before enriching itself every few bars with
    marimbas and an electric guitar synth-patch that nudges the shy song in its ribs to go ahead and propose.
    ""Disko + Bett"" could also soften a cynic's black heart with its house thump smudged with distorted guitar
    tones and a talcum-powdered, xylophone melody.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, ""Facing It""-- Duo505's dour attempt at drama with a Sunday dusk piano melody and a flat,
    accordion patch-- only punches a post to see a ghost.  In short: It's promising, but gradually tragic.
    Hence, this song ought to be played from every music box tucked into every car stereo, shopping mall, and
    hospital delivery room.  The social unrest would be legend.</p></div>"|2582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2582-late/|7.0|Cameron Macdonald

    new wave revival.  The truth is, Craig Macintosh's jittery vocals do work overtime to invoke XTC's Andy
    Partridge, the pop hooks are sugary enough for Orange Juice, and Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley's
    production is as florescent as their work for Dexys Midnight Runners or Madness.</p><p>
    
    But even if it comes cloaked in the trendy trappings of 2004's VH1 Classic/1980s obsession, <em>Please
    Describe Yourself</em> is really an exercise in <i>90s</i> nostalgia.  As star-crazy as Joan Rivers and as
    lackadaisical as Phil Daniels' ""Parklife"" narration, Dogs Die in Hot Cars' full-length debut has more in
    common with contemporary Britpop revivalists like Athlete or Ordinary Boys than 80s fetishists like Hot
    Hot Heat, stellastarr* or The Fever.</p><p>
    
    The telling moment is ""Lounger"", which nearly quotes the aforementioned Blur tune (""I get up when I like"")
    amid squeaky-clean guitars and Jarvis Cocker-like wit (so what if the melody recalls New Order's ""Temptation"").
    A snippet of awkward German even harks back to ""Parklife""'s ""Vorsprung durch Technik.""  In that light, opener
    (and second single) ""Godhopping"" sounds less like Men at Work and more like Menswe@r-- its ""all the way to
    Bombay"" lyric is thematically, if not geographically, reminiscent of Athlete's chipper ""El Salvador"".</p><p>
    
    ""Celebrity Sanctum""-- on which Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, and Lucy Liu all make silly/cute
    lyrical cameos-- shows the charming naivete of a band stuck in an era before reality TV muddied stardom's
    waters.  That song also includes the decidedly unsurprising revelation that these guys really ""just want
    someone that will come home.""  Presumably, she'll like Craig for Craig, not because he hangs with Leonardo.
    Standout track ""Paul Newman's Eyes"" continues our <em>US Weekly</em> celebfest.  Its chorus (""I wish I had
    Paul Newman's eyes"") grows less funny with each listen, but recovers on the strength of enormous hooks that
    should have you listening well after the joke has worn thin.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, first single ""I Love You 'Cause I Have To"" bobs and skanks like umpteenth-wave ska.  That's
    right: S-K-A.  Sure, they had that in the 80s, too, but if Reel Big Fish were to mount a mainstream
    comeback, this song would be their ticket to MTV2; cut the buoyant horns from their ""Take on Me"" cover,
    and you're halfway there.  Even ""Come on Eileen"" saw a slight return in the 90s, thanks to (guess who!)
    Save Ferris.  Goddamn right, Dogs Die in Hot Cars are living in the past-- the all-too-recent past.</p><p>
    
    Finally, I hate mentioning the self-important racket of Franz Ferdinand, but you should know that Dogs Die
    in Hot Cars are sort of the wimpy younger siblings of their fellow Glaswegians-- the asexual catwalk of
    ""Pastimes &amp; Lifestyles"" could dream of one day growing up to be ""Matinee"".  Whoever labeled Franz Ferdinand
    ""Scotpop"" for their post-Britpop proclivities was probably just talking out of his ass, but it's much better
    suited to Macintosh &amp; Co. than the abused-beyond-meaning appellative ""new wave.""</p></div>"|2583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2583-please-describe-yourself/|6.3|Marc Hogan

    built a substantial enough following to merit a few cash-ins.  Fortunately, they seem about as content ripping
    off their devotees as they are resting on their laurels, and <i>Bibidi Babidi Boo</i>, which could easily
    have been haphazardly rushed to stores as a stopgap money-maker, is instead being offered as a <i>gratis</i>
    download on the new Kill Rock Stars/5 Rue Christine free record label, KRS5RC.  The band's generosity goes
    a long way toward justifying its existence.</p><p>
    
    Few bands are as worthy of in-concert canonization as Deerhoof, whose live show is equal parts low-key
    spectacle and exploratory jam session.  Many of these live recordings convey a ferocity rarely found on
    the band's studio-recorded material.  Onstage, lead vocalist Satomi Matsuzaki is commanding rather than
    coy, drummer Greg Saunier has a crazed intensity yet unfailingly musters the band's challenging time
    signatures, and guitarist Chris Cohen subtly reshapes complex arrangements in a manner that feels
    improvisational but sounds precise and calculated.</p><p>
    
    That <i>Bibidi Babidi Boo</i> only sporadically manages to convey this energy isn't solely the fault of
    the band.  The album falls prey to the same oversights that so often lead to lackluster live albums-- a
    lack of proper sequencing, variable recording fidelity, and several weak performances tucked between stronger
    moments mar the album in the same way they might an ""official"" release.  Perhaps missteps should be expected
    when cost isn't an issue; still, it's somewhat disappointing that the band's loyal followers have to settle
    with a compromise rather than be rewarded with the live document they deserve.</p><p>
    
    The album's strongest moments emphasize Deerhoof's talents as a solid rock outfit without sacrificing the
    band's more experimental leanings.  Though free improvisation plays a large role in Deerhoof's songwriting
    process, <i>Bibidi Babidi Boo</i>'s most enjoyable tracks-- such as ""Milking"", which thrives on manic Kinks-like
    propulsion until its tranquil bridge-- streamline the spontaneous impulses of their studio counterparts.  In
    other places, however, the album is weighed down with filler and half-hearted interpretations.  ""Dog on the
    Sidewalk"" sacrifices the compelling minimalism of the band's original arrangement for uninspired rock
    embellishment.  Instrumental interludes such as ""All Rise"" and ""Rainbow Silhouette of the Milky Man"" are
    brief but superfluous, while ""Wicca Wind"", ""Satan"", and ""The Forbidden Fruits"" are culled from bland,
    low-energy performances.  Predictably, tracks recorded as BBC Peel Sessions-- including excellent versions
    of ""Giga Dance"" (which finds the band members switching instruments, notably Satomi filling in on drums)
    and ""Desaparecere""-- are of higher quality than the more informal radio and concert performances.</p><p>
    
    The interactive visual scheme of the project's website-- an ambiguous ""map"" of the various performances--
    emphasizes the album's casual creation; it follows no tracklist, and it doesn't even have a discernible
    form or structure.  These songs seem meant to be experienced and then kept or discarded at will, an
    informal approach that's both charming and frustrating.</p><p>
<i>Bibidi Babidi Boo</i> is destined to hold an awkward place in Deerhoof's impressive discography, if it's
    ever widely recognized as a proper release at all.  Though it's refreshing to know that Deerhoof have refused
    to play into the seedier commercial practices that so often characterize makeshift releases, the band's
    consideration doesn't exactly lift the album's dubious value.  The material here simply isn't fit for
    proper release, and the larger looming Great Download Debate that it might have incited a few years ago
    is old hat.  The crucial role of the internet in proliferating new music is pretty much unquestioned at
    this point, particularly among Deerhoof's audience.  <i>Bibidi Babidi Boo</i> is nice for the converted,
    but it's not an ideal place to discover the band.  It's little more than a cobbled together, expendable
    gift to their fans-- but at least the price is right.</p></div>"|2254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2254-bibidi-babidi-boo/|6.0|David Moore

Fans of the relentless Japanese
    psych cooperative have had a perpetual embarrassment of riches the past several years: By now, the savvier
    amongst us could've accumulated over 15 official albums released by the group since 2000.  (And that's not
    counting god-knows-how-many CDRs, side projects, and spinoffs.)  Theirs is quickly becoming one of the most
    daunting discographies in contemporary music.</p><p>
<i>Does the Cosmic Shepherd Dream of Electric Tapirs?</i> is yet another addition to their fans' bounty
    and everyone else's collective confusion.  Blissfully unfamiliar with concepts like restraint or moderation
    (or, one suspects, words like ""rehearsal"" or ""outtake"") AMT's every gesture is so amplified or exaggerated
    that it's as though they intend their work to be witnessed from across the solar system.  In the past,
    they've proven themselves equally adept at intense, Blue Cheer-inspired thunder-psych as well as delicate
    hippie folk, and on <i>Tapirs</i> they indulge themselves extensively in each idiom.  The group's revolving
    membership has waxed and waned over the years, but here they're trimmed down to a quintet, with guitarist
    and ""speed guru"" Makoto Kawabata surprisingly taking more of a supporting role than usual.</p><p>
    
    There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth in smoke-filled rumpus rooms all over the world when the news
    spread earlier this year that vocalist Cotton Casino was parting ways with AMT.  But she is present and
    very much accounted for on these recordings from 2002-2003, and knowing the way this bunch stockpiles
    material, I think it's premature to dub this her swan song.  Casino lends some Yoko-esque yowling to the
    quaintly titled thrash of opener ""Daddy's Bare Meat"", which also features blistering electric soloing from
    Kawabata and AMT's now familiar and somewhat cheesy <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>-like sci-fi sound effects.</p><p>
    
    After that chaotic but less-than-innovative start, AMT promptly switch gears and decide to do some extensive
    daisy-picking and beard-stroking.  Multi-instrumentalist and ""cosmic joker"" Tsuyama Atsushi takes the lead
    on the acoustic-based ""Suzie Sixteen"", a short ditty that sounds like Os Mutantes singing doo-wop with your
    neighborhood alleycats (yes, there is actually meowing) and the Incredible String Band-referencing ""The
    Assassin's Beautiful Daughter"" which features such a gentle weave of guitar and recorder that it's sure to
    send you traipsing barefoot across the first meadow you can find.</p><p>
    
    But no Acid Mothers Temple release would be complete without a mind-swallowing epic, and the 25-minute
    ""Dark Star Blues"" fulfills the requirement here.  If there are any direct quotations of the Grateful Dead's
    legendary showpiece ""Dark Star"", I'm not sophisticated enough to detect them.  Kawabata and company do,
    however, ride a simple, repetitive electric riff and Casino's towering vocals well beyond any galaxy Bobby
    Weir has visited in the past couple of decades.  Personally, I'd have appreciated the drums being given
    more prominence in the mix-- the muddy sound keeps this track from being as devastating as it must've been
    in the room where it was recorded.</p><p>
    
    The record finishes with the pure, featureless drone of ""The Transmigration of Hopheads"" (I'm unsure if
    there's an overarching point to the Philip K. Dick allusions of their titles here), a track even more
    minimalist than AMT's 2002 version of Terry Riley's <i>In C</i> and one that serves as a soothing tonic
    to the turbulence that's preceded it.  It's an oddly fitting end to an album that splashes dead center
    into the ocean of AMT's burgeoning catalog.</p></div>"|24.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/24-does-the-cosmic-shepherd-dream-of-electric-tapirs/|6.8|Matthew Murphy

    to the air, you could ride it.""  On their first two albums for Trance Syndicate, Windsor for the Derby took
    this possibility for granted.  Covering thick, steel-curtain guitars with enough space in which to flop
    around, they seemed content to play aural scavenger, assembling the myriad junk-sale parts for you but
    demanding your own images and vicarious frameworks.  So it comes as something of a surprise that on their
    sixth album, <i>We Fight Til Death</i>, Windsor seem to carry a grudge and make jagged accusations.  One
    can't but imagine that, if pressed, they'd now flick a dandelion spore in Ms. Morrison's bluest eye and
    hum something about the vacuity of the word ""surrendered.""</p><p>
    
    Well-played post-rock was always the bedrock of Windsor's sound, but they've added angst, a flayed post-punk
    edge, and new-wave organ loops to their ambition, creating a sound that should be familiar to Yo La Tengo
    fans, yet remains distinctly this band's own.  Beginning on 2002's <i>The Emotional Rescue</i>, Windsor
    began to use vocals for more than just their innate musical timbres, and some of the foggy mutterings and
    inaudible wordings began to become genuinely decipherable.  A subtle move away from their previous soundscapes,
    that album showed them reaching beyond academic musings, spawning teeth in the process, and learning how
    to gum at-- if not to gnash and grind-- the periphery of their sound.</p><p>
    
    Now, on <i>We Fight Til Death</i>, Windsor for the Derby has put those incisors to use.  The band hasn't
    lost the ability to soundtrack your lunch-hour daydreams, but the pacing on this album never subsides into
    monotonous quiet/loud dynamics, and the surprises all seem to throb with enough tension and release to
    avoid scattershot inscrutability.  Indeed, Windsor seems to be asking: What is a vacation without the
    hourglass grind of the workday?  So once the drifting, lysergic burst of gorgeous opener ""The Melody of
    a Fallen Tree"" subsides, the sweaty humidity it creates must break.  It comes like a dank, determined
    storm on the ringing guitars on ""Nightingale"", committing the unspeakable bastard mash-up of Doors-derived
    incandescence with the anthemic rhythms of Talking Heads.</p><p>
    
    Windsor head back to their roots on the moody ""The Door Is Red"".  It's post-rock with a noir-punk sensibility--
    too gassed with inert pleasures to ever rise to its feet-- and it uses that sangfroid refusal to fill the
    air with arrangements based on stillness and pensive voids.  The song revels in hesitation, and while its
    guitars seem to want to argue the point, they eventually agree to disagree.</p><p>
    
    After the minor mid-album lull-- the inert ""Logic and Surprise"" and the forcibly manic ""Black Coats"", two
    songs which seem to regress to paint-by-numbers indie rock-- comes the album's most immediately charming
    song, ""A Spring Like Sixty"".  Atop slow, shuffling drums and flickering acoustic guitar, Windsor creates
    an arid, itchy ballad that dries the sweat from the record's straining and heaving.  Despite all of its
    unpredictable sidesteps, nothing on the album prepares you for the mechanical Germanic grind of ""For People
    Unknown"". Bouncing on lockstep rhythms and a hypnotic guitar, the song's determinedly glacial sounds are
    both soothing and celebratory.</p><p>
    
    Closer ""Flight"" recedes into the distance, sifting itself into smudgy dawns smoked with rotted leaves.  The
    song's stinging feedback is as close to their former material as anything on the album, but it also underscores
    their growth.  You don't need to create your own images with their efforts any longer; this whirlwind work
    coaxes you into one communal memory after another.  Windsor for the Derby is no longer content to merely
    ride the air--- they're determined to suck it from the room and choke you dim.</p></div>"|8783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8783-we-fight-til-death/|8.3|Derek Miller

Considering the morass of feckless
    singer/songwriters, quality artists are like exotic treasures and their presence has been so marginalized
    that fans often lack the know-how to separate the grist from the mill. Some artists thrive on winsome
    personalities, cunningly distracting listeners from the music with their stylistic excess. They stand out
    like TV antennae in an electric storm, inviting critical rejection and the inevitable backlash of the
    fickle scenesters who often comprise their fanbase.</p><p>
    
    But if the Ben Kwellers of the genre take the easy route to notoriety in an overpopulated field, where
    does that leave the Paul Brills? Brill is a harmless bloke-- too good to be dragged down by his loudmouth
    peers and too modest to do anything about it. <i>New Pagan Love Song</i> is the New York-native's third
    full-length effort, but to most listeners it will serve as his introduction.</p><p>
    
    Coy artists such as Brill often suffer from the attention-grabbing exploits of their lesser contemporaries.
    But then, that's their choice. As a member of the San Francisco-based Envelope, he endured the tension of
    a major-label bidding war, which wore on the band and ultimately led to their dissolution. In the years
    since, he's helmed a formidable if not yet widely recognized solo career. For <i>New Pagan Love Song</i>,
    Brill also took the roles of producer and engineer, affording himself increased creative freedom. The
    result is a demure opus that serves as a testament to the enduring potency of classical pop songwriting.
    The album is like a montage of matchbook paintings, full of small treasures that by blinking you may risk
    missing.</p><p>
    
    The album shows a consistent affinity for time-tested techniques, but Brill isn't afraid to capitalize on
    the expanded palette afforded by modern technology, dipping in electronic affectations that allow his
    abundant creativity to flourish. The liner notes even boast a ""glitch guru,"" Michael McKnight, who doubtless
    played a key role in making the stuttered beats. On the virulently-catchy ""Comeback Kid"", a <i>Yankee Hotel
    Foxtrot</i>-style blend of electro-acoustic kitchen sink percussion pilots a bucolic array of instruments
    that includes banjo and pedal steel, while the saucy ""Lay Down Your Weary Head"" smacks of Portishead with
    its shuffling downtempo drumbeat and snappy upright bass groove.</p><p>
    
    Brill's sound owes to a diverse set of forebears, but the composite typically falls somewhere between
    Elliott Smith and Grandaddy-- influences he flaunts loudly on ""Everything I Believe In"". There, Brill
    sounds a lot like Grandaddy's Jason Lytle, delivers a wrenching vocal performance that he drapes gently
    and plaintively over a glitchy piano-based waltz. Hardly overwhelmed by its digital apparel, the song
    thrives on the sort of classical restraint that lent Smith's songs timelessness. On ""Weekday Bender"" there
    are strains of Brendan Benson or Fountains of Wayne, while tracks like ""Daylight Scars"" and ""Desert Song""
    reveal Brill's fondness for electro-pop architects such as Lali Puna and Juana Molina.</p><p>
<i>New Pagan Love Song</i> also carries a loose story line, tracing a confused, presumably amnesiac
    character through several episodes. For the most part, Brill's storytelling is simplistic, and it offers
    enough ambiguity to foster multiple interpretations. But while understated to the point of being almost
    inconsequential, the lyrical content only impedes Brill's defiantly traditionalist vibe. And as a result,
    <i>New Pagan Love Song</i> is a quiet accomplishment but an accomplishment nonetheless.</p></div>"|1133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1133-new-pagan-love-song/|7.4|Sam Ubl

    Memphis indie rock band that seems to be talked about more than listened to.  For instance, none of the alleged
    Grifters fans I know seem to own any of their albums (""I think I used to have that one with the demon-looking
    guy on the front..."") or even remember what they sounded like.  How has such a supposedly beloved band fallen
    so deeply into the cracks?</p><p>
    I have a theory: Shouse writes good music that you enjoy as long as you're listening to it, but which flies
    out of your head as soon as you stop.  People mainly namecheck The Grifters due to a period of prominence on
    Sub Pop in the mid-to-late 1990s, but his Darla- and V2-released LPs with Those Bastard Souls have long since
    been relegated to sub-footnote status in the indie rock annals.  And his current project, The Bloodthirsty
    Lovers, is even more of a mirage than his last two groups (I think-- what did they sound like again?).  The
    music hangs before your eyes, swirling like an exhaled breath on a cold day.  But as soon as the record ends,
    the first breeze shatters it into oblivion.</p><p>
    The Bloodthirsty Lovers have garnered rave reviews for their spacious, gauzy yet anthemic laptop-pop.  Comparisons
    to Big Star, Radiohead, Pink Floyd, Brian Eno, and The Flaming Lips weigh down their press clips.  You'd think
    a band with such effusive critical éclat and high-profile points of reference would be on everybody's lips,
    but ask yourself (and this is crucial): <em>Do you know anyone who listens to them?</em><em></em></p><p>
    Perhaps Bloodthirsty Lovers are that peculiar band who critics love and fans ignore (hello, Flying Saucer
    Attack), but I think it's more like this-- you listen to <em>The Delicate Seam</em>, you dig it, and then
    just forget to listen to it again.  I'd lay this pneumonic short-circuit at the feet of Shouse's melodies.
    They're charming enough, but often meander so capriciously through the big 80s drums, Frenchkiss'
    standard-issue Les Savy Fav basslines, and coruscating, glitchy ambience that they don't instantly sear
    their signatures onto neurons like the sonically similar (if more memorable) synthetic popscapes of The
    Flaming Lips.</p><p>
    Indeed, of the comparisons The Bloodthirsty Lovers have drawn, The Flaming Lips one is most accurate.  But
    where the Lips are linear and hummable, the Lovers radiate out in concentric rings and often elude melodic
    summary.  <em>The Delicate Seam</em>-- clocking in at a lean eight tracks-- finds Shouse collaborating with
    Big Ass Truck's Steve Selvidge and ex-Dambuilders drummer Kevin March.  It opens with ""The Mods Go Mad"",
    a dizzy digi-anthem laden with bombastic guitars, incandescent electronic scribbles, and skewed aphorisms
    like, ""You're my napalm; I'm your codeine.""</p><p>
    ""Stiltwalkers' Local #119"" stretches a straining vocal melody over plodding drums, rigidly buzzing chords,
    and reverberating electro flourishes.  The aberrant ""A Postcard from the Sea"" is truly catchy, recalling
    the simple, mid-tempo pop of Galaxie 500-- all shiny chords and peppy emoting.  The liquid swing of ""El
    Shocko"" imagines The Beach Boys as the ghost in the machine, delicate harmonies surging through fiber-optic
    wires.  And closer ""Medicated"" features vocals from Young People singer Katie Eastburn; its languid strumming,
    percolating drones, and Eastburn's understated murmurs waft by like a hazy memory.  And so, we finally locate
    The Bloodthirsty Lovers' particular double bind: The obscure, amorphous quality that makes their music
    interesting is the same quality that makes it difficult for the mind to hold on to.</p></div>"|811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/811-the-delicate-seam/|7.0|Brian Howe

In full mushroom-cloud bloom, Blood Brothers Johnny Whitney and Jordan
    Blilie scream as if they're drowning, their scalpel-thin shrieks clinging to each other as they flail.
    The effect is not just vicious and visceral but downright brutal.  All you can do is cringe.</p><p>
    The catchiest tune on <i>Crimes</i>-- the quintet's fourth full-length and first for
    V2-- sounds like a Boss Hog track.  It's called ""Love Rhymes With Hideous Car Wreck"", and it features a
    scuzz-punk riff and Whitney bleating, ""Love love love, love love love, love love love, love love love,""
    as if he were the prancing flower girl at Björk's wedding.  Blilie snarls baritone macho counterpoint
    like Jon Spencer, except he's full of murderous disdain instead of himself.  Eventually, he's overpowered
    by a 30-second throat-shredding breakdown.</p><p>
    Yes, the Brothers still overuse lyrical gore the way the <i>Evil Dead</i> series did Kero syrup, but their
    sonic pace and intensity has somewhat slowed.  This, the band insists, is borne out of necessity.  Plowing
    through three straight five-minute shrieking-fit epics from last year's breakthrough <i>Burn, Piano Island,
    Burn</i> proved exhausting and near-impossible onstage, so <i>Crimes</i> paces itself with entrails-spilling
    murder ballads and packs its breakneck hardcore freakouts into two-minute dirty bombs.  Thus, you now get
    both the decaying equine jam ""Beautiful Horses"" (""Ride the crippled horse! Ride the broken mare! Ride the
    jaundiced buck!""), as well as the fabulous pop/punk-flaying ""Teen Heat"", which coins the excellent phrase
    ""promageddon.""  However, any fears that the songs' slashed runtimes are a pop makeover for their new label
    are unwarranted: The Brothers remain as violent and creatively unpleasant as ever, with enough clout to
    thank Brett Gurewitz in the liner notes but enough subversion to misspell his name.</p><p>
    In the ""How the Hell Could This Possibly Be a College Radio Hit?"" category, ""Trash Flavored Trash"" isn't
    quite as joyously horrifying as <i>Piano Island</i>'s ""Ambulance vs. Ambulance"", but it still highlights
    what these Seattle miscreants do best: coat Dali-worthy horror flick imagery (""There's a girl in a cage
    making love to a switchblade/ There's a man behind bars milking abandoned cars/ There's a priest in
    shackles building bombs out of bibles"") in candy-coated riffs that roil and mutate and abruptly erupt.</p><p>
<i>Crimes</i>' quieter moments are neither as predictable nor consistent.  The title track/mission statement
    (""We're just like those condom wrappers/ Used up, torn up, thrown away"") showcases Whitney's astonishing
    vocal range, which veers from tortured James Brown screams to spot-on simulations of new labelmate Jack
    White's baby-talk tirades and Gossip diva Beth Ditto's white-punks-on-Aretha testifying.  On ""Live at the
    Apocalypse Cabaret"" he's somewhat muzzled, hauling in Blilie's spoken-word sneers for balance but saddling
    the duet with a decaying Ben Folds piano bar-bounce weighed down by a macabre image ammo dump: masturbating
    priests, lions eating your children on television, ""Baby heads planted in the ground don't make baby trees.""
    The tune's moody piano-and-guitar outro is gloriously mauled by ""Beautiful Horses"", and although the record's
    finale, ""Devastator"", begins with fervent gospel moans, they're eventually torn asunder by an atom bomb-tossing
    brawl showcasing perhaps the Brothers' ultimate thesis: ""Everybody needs a little devastation.""  Just because
    The Blood Brothers figured out how to prevent exhausting themselves doesn't mean they can't exhaust you.</p></div>"|809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/809-crimes/|7.5|Rob Harvilla

Their
    debut full-length, <i>Calculating Infinity</i>, launched them to a level of prestige previously unknown to
    purveyors of their brand of speed metal, and its impact on the hardcore and rock communities ensured the
    somewhat astounding longevity of their name recognition.  Musical dexterity has always been the band's
    primary selling point, but the contributions of their original vocalist, Dmitri Minakakis, often seem
    underappreciated.  Minakakis' passionate, incendiary delivery provided tangible pathos to the band's
    awe-inspiring but detached musicianship.</p><p>
    
    The band diverted attention from Minakakis' 2001 departure with an ingenious sleight of hand: While The
    Dillinger Escape Plan searched for a new lead vocalist, they filled their temporary vacancy with Mike
    Patton, whose stellar vocal contributions to their previous release, 2002's <i>Irony Is a Dead Scene</i>
    EP, suggested a bright if purely hypothetical future for the band.  But this consummate metal wet dream
    was ultimately short-lived: Patton promptly left his special guest spot in the DEP roster, and the band
    fell back on Greg Puciato, whose promising demos won him a permanent spot as leading vocalist.</p><p>
    
    Common Sense dictated that Puciato's role in the band would be something of a stopgap position; it would
    seem that a new and relatively unknown vocalist wouldn't exceed the legacies of his predecessors, but also
    wouldn't significantly hinder the sound the band has honed for so many years.  But five years after their
    last LP, Puciato is still on board.  <i>Miss Machine</i>'s first few tracks are business as usual for DEP:
    ""Panasonic Youth"" and ""Sunshine the Werewolf""-- though not as punishing as most of the band's earlier
    material-- serve as an adequate bridge between their seminal debut and the brooding atmosphere of their
    work with Patton.  Ben Weinman and Brian Benoit's frantically spiraling guitar figures and Chris Pennie's
    double-bass drum marathons give way to bristling, low-key breakdowns, and the band always manages to retain
    their brutal hardcore crunch within complex, fluid time signatures.  Puciato lacks both Minakakis' immediacy
    and Patton's oily charm, but he manages to evoke both vocalists on the album's strongest tracks.</p><p>
    
    However, DEP is still struggling to re-establish a unified and compelling sound, and their newfound penchant
    for melodic exploration seems out of place amid the album's most inspired thrash moments.  ""Phone Home"" revels
    in sluggish, overbearing doom metal and spoils the album's bristling momentum, and ""Setting Fire to Sleeping
    Giants"" is timid and repetitive, unimaginatively juxtaposing menacingly hushed verses with a phoned-in
    shrieking chorus.  Puciato's Patton-indebted metal crooning comes across as awkward and seems incompatible
    with the album's aggressive drive.  On the perplexing ""Unretrofied"", the band shamelessly apes second-shelf
    Faith No More, leaning toward melodic pop and away from the band's trademark sound.</p><p>
    
    Though <i>Miss Machine</i> displays DEP in top musical form, the band seems to have lost its confidence
    and direction. The album is alternately pensive and playful, and this fundamental musical split in their
    approach-- exemplified by Puciato's decided lack of a distinctive voice-- prevents their new material from
    reaching anything near the heights of their previous work. A few missteps are to be expected after years
    of internal change, but <i>Miss Machine</i>'s confusing musical tangents and general aimlessness show The
    Dillinger Escape Plan straining to find their footing in the very scene they helped to define.</p></div>"|2315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2315-miss-machine/|6.8|David Moore

    closed, blocking out all visuals except the brief daggers of light that flicker with each passing car. There
    is a sense of probable dread-- metal, wooden or cigarette debris from the vehicles could fly off and injure
    you-- but also one of hypnotized calm, thanks to the amplified hum of Michelin and Goodyear against greased
    concrete.  Dimuzio, a San Francisco electro-noise composer, seemingly replicates this experience with massive,
    body-vibrating drones punctuated by abrupt, skreeing hits of white noise.  His improvised performances--
    usually performed with guitar feedback and short-wave radio files processed with a laptop and CDJ player--
    explore the gray area between tranquility and disarray, and they can draw your imagination into a wilderness
    it will refuse to leave, even when your nerves are shot by so many conflicting emotions.</p><p>
<i>Slew</i> compiles the veteran's 14 years' worth of compilation tracks, which range between hallucinatory
    dronescapes and jolted short-wave experiments.  The album is a sequel to Dimuzio's fine 2002 compilation,
    <i>Mono::Poly</i>, which features collaborations with notable noiseniks like Chris Cutler, Atau Tanaka,
    and Fred Frith-- plus his document of DJ QBert taking musical brown acid.  Like any Dimuzio record, <i>Slew</i>
    is filled with tracks that demand full attention-- even during their quietest moments, instances which tend
    to gently shimmer to a scalding boil.</p><p>
    
    ""Never Steven"" opens <i>Slew</i>, and sets its mood.  A remix of Dr. Nerve's ""44 Nerve Events"", the track
    is jumpstarted by a psycho-traumatic guitar rummaging through junk metal percussion and cricket-chirp
    microtones that kick in like a state of numb and blissful physical shock.  ""Radiotraces"", Dimuzio's remix
    of avant-cellist Tom Cora, disrupts that peace with emotionally perplexed string melodies that seem to be
    stranded in the middle of the sea.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Slew</i> never releases that tension.  On ""Usher Substart""-- a suitable tune for a compilation
    titled <i>Soundtrack for the End of the World</i>-- Dimuzio concocts a ringing and crescendo-rising drone
    from an electric guitar and a clarinet that resembles a field recording of an industrial neighborhood slowly
    melting in a thermonuclear firestorm.  ""Hinge Map Ridge"" and ""Zero Tolerance"" also nod off to a bell-like
    drone, but in a more rhythmic and meditative light.  ""4 Poles"" brilliantly unleashes fragmented, baby grand
    piano that skitters between stereo channels while the humidity soaks the walls with a soft, greenhouse din
    created from nothing more than feedback.  ""Untitled"", which uncannily recreates a sweatshop atmosphere out
    of feedback and metallic noises that mimic a dozen sewing machines' tick-tacking needles jammed with ripped
    hair and caked dust.  And then there's ""Turnkey (Onionhouse)"", which dances in the acid-rainwashed streets
    with scrambled short-wave vocals and DSP'd beats that drag their bleeding feet.</p><p>
    
    Folks who consider drone music to be monotonous or pharmaceutically bastardized should obviously keep their
    distance from <i>Slew</i>.  But Dimuzio's work doesn't require any postmodern conceptual disclaimer that must
    be read to understand any of his music-- it is to be felt.  Whatever your tastes may be, please consider his
    musique concrete zinger ""Yard"".  Here, he gold-pans away the grime of an air conditioner drone and discovers
    a looped piece of gibberish from what the liner notes attribute to an Elvis impersonator in a parade.  What
    sounds like Ben Ali go-carts then circle around and mutates into lawn sprinklers. So alien.</p></div>"|2581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2581-slew/|8.3|Cameron Macdonald

    electro-jazz ambience.  It was an interesting record that ultimately showed Jelinek as something of
    a jazz-dub vintner: Ideally, clouds of cymbal splashes and piano overtones should have at least a decade
    to mellow inside dusty vinyl grooves before he works his magic on them-- preferably stored improperly
    in a horizontal stack in a neglected corner of an old record shop.</p><p>
    But the real problem may have been that, as listeners unfamiliar with Triosk, we tended to approach their
    <i>1+3+1</i> collaboration as a Jelinek record, which wasn't quite right.  Jelinek was but \xBC of a
    cross-continental quartet and his contributions suffered from high expectations.  Now with <i>Moment
    Returns</i>-- a Triosk album with a couple of actual Jelinek elements and a number of band-created
    treatments inspired by his methods-- it's possible to hear what Triosk and Jelinek were going for in
    a new light.</p><p>
    The important thing to note about Triosk is that they are truly a post-modern jazz group inspired by
    recorded documents of performance and driven by ""feel"" rather than tradition.  Triosk is best understood
    as ""jazz"" with quotes, as they use the instrumentation and approach of a classic jazz trio (mostly
    piano/bass/drums, with some Fender Rhodes and vibes) to explore moods rather than the implications of
    chord changes.  The approach is exceedingly lyrical; pianist Adrian Klumpes has found a path to the
    ""sparkling water cascading down from some clear waterfall"" sound Miles Davis so admired in Bill Evans'
    playing, and their electronic treatments add a balanced undercurrent of noise to keep the music from
    being too sweet.</p><p>
    The music on <i>Moment Returns</i> was composed around the same time as the material generated for <i>1+3+1</i>,
    and two tracks here feature Jelinek contributions.  The nine-minute ""I Am a Beautiful and Unique Snowflake""
    could be considered the record's centerpiece, and it encapsulates everything interesting about Triosk.
    Moving between a spacious Satie-like minimalism, where a halting four-note tune nervously takes shape
    above meandering bass and drums and a fountain of Jelinek's vinyl crackle, ""I Am a Beautiful and Unique
    Snowflake"" gushes forth in a loud payoff of heavy block chords and huge splashes of ride cymbal.  ""Chrono""
    begins with a classic Jelinek loop of slinky acoustic bass with a protective coating of digital noise
    before Klumpes' descending piano lines pull the tune into the clear melodic light.</p><p>
    Triosk is not shy about identifying Jelinek as a major inspiration, so it's no surprise that the electronic
    flavoring the band adds on its own (all three members are credited with ""loops"") occasionally bears his
    stamp.  The needle fuzz that accompanies the opening theme of ""Re-Ignite"" certainly sounds familiar, giving
    the noir ballad-- which makes interesting use of what sounds like a synthesized harp-- an extra dose of
    mystery.  ""Awake in the Deep"" opens with two-note bass pattern and an eerie drone of distant feedback, but
    there's also the minutely detailed sound of a manual turntable that's been left unattended to fill the
    considerable space.</p><p>
    The synthesized drones the band plays along to on ""Love Chariot"" and ""Tomorrowtoday Part 1"" relate more
    to the older ambient tradition of Eno, but in every case, Triosk's electro-acoustic blend remains coherent
    and inspired.  All told, <i>Moment Returns</i> is a surprisingly effective record that tops their Jelinek
    collaboration, with the surface prettiness to fill background space, and enough detail and depth to survive
    close scrutiny.</p></div>"|8252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8252-moment-returns/|7.8|Mark Richardson

    slash, be filled with hysterical hiccups from frontman Rick Valentin, and get its guidance and cool from bassist
    Rose Marshack.  But this isn't any other year.  It's an election year-- one that this band, and many others,
    seem to feel holds more importance than previous ones.  In 2004, between Dean screams and Bush smirks, we've
    endured a steady stream of musical commentary.  From Fat Wreck's <i>Rock Against Bush</i> comps, the stewing
    polemics of Steve Earle's <i>The Revolution Starts... Now</i>, and the star-ridden lineups of MoveOn's Vote

    Now Poster Children have thrown
    their hat into the protest music ring with a tidy explosive device called <i>On the Offensive</i>.  And,
    rather than penning six original anti-Bush screeds, the band offers six covers, ensuring that the EP won't
    become instantly dated.  So, upfront, <i>Offensive</i> scores points for blending the Poster Kids' activist
    streak with cred factor-- because no matter who wins in November, the band's faithful and raucous cover of
    The Clash's ""Clampdown"" will remain totally righteous.</p><p>
<i>On the Offensive</i> dusts off a few other diatribes from the previous conservative era, as well.  The
    burbling plastastic synthesizers of Heaven 17's 1981 single ""(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang""
    are replaced by a whiny chaos of both keyboards and guitars, and Valentin channeling H17 vocalist Glenn
    Gregory's dramatic phrasing.  X's ""New World"" is also reborn, but with Valentin and Marshack's eerily
    perfect regeneration of the John Doe/Exene Cervenka harmony dynamic.  With the volume down you might think
    your stereo slipped back to 1983.  Wait: economic depression, a paranoid populace, fearmongering leaders.
    Maybe it did!</p><p>
    The Kids also tear into ""Divide and Conquer"" by Hüsker Dü, a band whose name has been dropped in the more
    overzealous reviews of Green Day's ambitious but ultimately just lengthy and loud <i>American Idiot</i>.
    The greatest thing about <i>On the Offensive</i> is that it's never as idealistically raucous as something
    like <i>Idiot</i>: It's a banged-out covers record, not an attempt at a sweeping statement.  And it wisely
    lets pure rock power do the preaching.  On ""Divide"", The Poster Children seem more concerned with getting
    the lead guitar's trebly urgency right than hammering home the statement.  As they do on the rest of <i>On
    the Offensive</i> (including the readings of Fear and XTC that fill out the set), they want their versions
    to stand up sonically, to be counted long after the 2004 presidential election.  The band understands that
    the EP's embedded message to vote and be heard-- oh, and that Bush really sucks-- doesn't need incessant
    harping.  It's there in the distortion of all these songs, and the throwback sound of the era they represent.</p></div>"|6438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6438-on-the-offensive-ep/|7.0|Johnny Loftus

    Camper Van Beethoven perhaps left behind the most uncertain legacy.  Their California-baked, Middle Eastern-tinged
    ska-folk was always a bit too silly to appeal to dour, purebred hipsters; and they didn't stay together long
    enough to enjoy the commercial success of fellow college radio alumni like R.E.M., Meat Puppets, or Soul
    Asylum.  And unlike other recently reunited acts like Pixies or Mission of Burma, Camper Van Beethoven have
    never been particularly influential.  Then, of course, there's the Cracker factor.  Although David Lowery's
    post-Camper unit have surely had their moments, too often it seemed as though Lowery's chief objective with
    that band was to deaden any lingering fondness aging CVB fans might have for him.</p><p>
    
    So despite the fact that their best albums-- particularly 1988's <i>Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart</i>--
    hold up as well as nearly anything from the era, the bottom line is that Camper Van Beethoven entered the
    new century with much of their music out of print and their reputation in desperate need of rehabilitation.
    Thankfully, the group's members recognized this and put themselves to work brushing away the cobwebs and
    sweeping up the rec room.  Live reunion gigs and archival releases like their version of Fleetwood Mac's
    <i>Tusk</i> and 2002's handsome box set <i>Cigarettes &amp; Carrot Juice: The Santa Cruz Years</i> primed the
    motor; now Camper Van has fully completed their re-ignition campaign with this bona fide reunion album,
    which features their entire classic line-up: Lowery, guitarist Greg Lisher, bassist Victor Krummenacher,
    drummer Chris Pedersen, violinist Jonathan Segel, plus David Immergluck on extra guitar and strings.</p><p>
    
    For better or worse, Camper Van Beethoven have gone to great lengths to ensure that <i>New Roman Times</i>
    is no mere nostalgia trip.  Never a band to do things by half-measures, here they've delivered a full-fledged
    concept album/rock opera complete with a daffy plot about a fictional America divided into smaller republics
    (most notably the secular Republic of California and the Fundamentalist Christian Republic of Texas) who
    are at war with one another.  The plot isn't always easy to follow-- and perhaps we'd all be better off
    ignoring it entirely-- but it does allow the band to employ some none-too-disguised political jabs as well
    as to indulge their taste for 1970s-style prog rock.</p><p>
    
    But it's this self-indulgent streak that gets <i>New Roman Times</i> off to an inauspicious start. Following
    the brief, uneventful introductory ""Prelude"", the band immediately launches into the ponderous math-rock of
    ""Sons of the New Golden West"".  The track would be completely unrecognizable as CVB if not for Segel's distinctive
    fiddle above the din.  When this unpleasantness is followed by the bland Crackerisms of ""51-7"" and the ridiculous
    FM power chording of ""White Fluffy Clouds"", you'd be forgiven for thinking that maybe this reunion wasn't
    such a hot idea after all.</p><p>
    
    However, things improve with the pedal steel lilt of ""That Gum You Like Is Back in Style"", a wistful country
    tune that would've fit effortlessly onto 1989's <i>Key Lime Pie</i>.  With this track the group finally begins
    to hit its weird and familiar stride.  At their best, Camper Van Beethoven are able to casually pull off
    genre-leaping exploits that most bands would be foolish to even attempt, and they reach just such a pinnacle
    when they bounce recklessly from the brain-damaged hoedown of ""Militia Song"" to the self-explanatory instrumental
    ""R'N'R Uzbekistan"" to the melodic gypsy sway of ""The Poppies of Balmorhea"".  Other highlights include the
    surprisingly convincing cop-show funk of ""Discotheque CVB"" and the tripped-out ""I Am Talking to This Flower""
    which eventually spills out into a nutty version of Steve Reich's tape-loop piece ""Come Out"".  On these tracks--
    and the genuinely disorienting ""I Hate This Part of Texas""-- the group surprisingly re-attains the delightful
    THC-fuelled heights of strangeness that made them special in the first place.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, these high points are surrounded by plenty of semi-coherent nonsense about the wanderings of
    their fictional protagonist soldier boy, who is prone to making weighty pronouncements like, ""I would die for
    hippie chicks!""  In case you couldn't guess, the political content here is wielded with all the subtlety of
    a rubber mallet, and features such refined irony as Lowery chanting, ""Might makes right/ God is on our side
    and makes us mighty.""  It's this broad streak of trite wise-assery that kept too many would-be listeners from
    taking Camper Van Beethoven seriously back in their heyday.  And while the band has done much in the past
    couple years to restore their legacy to the respectability it deserves, one has to hope that their smirks
    don't torpedo this second act as well.</p></div>"|1266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1266-new-roman-times/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

    Carey Mercer, has turned spitty, snarly, and lupine.  Where he once sounded like David Bowie, he now seems
    to channel Tim Buckley-- he's no longer a singer so much as a yelping, rasping, contorting spectacle.</p><p>
    
    Mercer's throaty kabuki made both Frog Eyes' limited, acoustic LP <i>Ego Scriptor</i> and his solo album,
    <i>Light Flows the Putrid Dawn</i>, so thoroughly spooky that few listeners could digest them without a
    seventh-track stretch.  Unsurprisingly, Xiu Xiu comparisons have steadily surfaced.  While Jamie Stewart
    has become subtler, more musical and less vaudevillian, Mercer is becoming flashier, extra-musical, and
    terrifically affected.  They're moving in opposite directions, but both men have arrived at the same
    crossroad-- expect a Frog Eyes/Xiu Xiu seven-inch split any day now.</p><p>
    
    The rest of Frog Eyes have always proved an excellent supporting cast to Mercer's Lear.  Their buggy leader
    has the hooks and crazy headshake thing, so the band simply focuses on dutiful playing, giving both <i>The
    Bloody Hand</i> and <i>The Golden River</i> an unearthed lost-scrolls-of-Gallus glow which never would have
    materialized had the Frog Eyes worker bees left Queen Mercer and squirreled up their own private honey pots.</p><p>
    
    And yet, there now seems to have been a bit of a revolt.  Frog Eyes' newest effort, <i>The Folded Palm</i>,
    is at times complete anarchy: Mercer chews up his own melodies and spits them out with nary a tone left,
    drummer Melanie Campbell plays her most violent set to date, piano man Grayson Walker insists on spelling
    out chords that mirror the band leader's, and bassist Michael Rak is either transgressing well into guitar
    and key ranges or competing with their volume.  That's not to say the band isn't playing together-- as usual,
    they're tight as hell.  What they're doing is matching Mercer bite for bite and catcall for caterwaul, like
    a four-headed dog feasting on the same coin-eyed meal.  As a result, <i>The Folded Palm</i> is the band at
    its loudest and most menacing.</p><p>
    
    To say the album ""starts off strong"" is only half the story-- the opening three-song suite is a fucking
    firebomb.  Campbell calls the band to arms with a tricky stomp and a crack at her trashcan cymbal, and a
    barrage of sound named ""The Fence Feels Its Post"" follows her command.  Mercer's howls barely break through
    the mix, and when they do, they tend to the frantic and imagistic.  The song bleeds into ""The Akhian Press"",
    a more musical, less theatrical return to past Frog Eyes tracks such as <i>The Golden River</i>'s ""World's
    Greatest Concertos"".  ""I Like Dot Dot Dot"" is the shortest of the opening three tracks (which is saying
    something when you consider that the longest is only 1:52), and the closest Frog Eyes come to punk on this
    album-- it's all fast strums, headless chicken deliveries, and Mercer's gorgeous chorus-pedal lick.  ""The
    Akhian Press"" and ""I Like Dot Dot Dot"" debuted earlier this year on <i>Ego Scriptor</i>, but the fuller
    <i>The Folded Palm</i> recordings make those versions seem like mere footnotes.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>The Folded Palm</i> shares in the tri-partite opener's fury-- the best songs smartly stay
    short of the three-minute line, and some don't even stretch over two.  It's a shame that, since the band has
    diffused song emphasis from the Mercer core and kicked up the energy, the truly memorable melodies that made
    each of <i>The Golden River</i> and <i>The Hand</i> a success have trouble finding their place amidst the
    new jitter.  Whereas substance used to take precedence over style, Mercer's theatrics now often obscure
    potentially beautiful lines.  ""New Soft Motherhood Alliance""-- one of the most successful songs on Mercer's
    solo album-- now drowns in its own cheap make-up and gaudy Meat Loaf melodrama.</p><p>
    
    Frog Eyes have played live more often in 2004 than in years past, and <i>The Folded Palm</i> benefits from
    the band's wealth of on-stage energy.  Naturally, their yelps and instrumental overloads work better when
    they are not only heard but also seen and felt; yet it will be exciting to discover how Frog Eyes makes
    good on the implicit commitment they make on <i>The Folded Palm</i> to mirroring their live and recorded
    personas.  For the time being, three solid records in one year will more than suffice.</p></div>"|3267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3267-the-folded-palm/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

I like them okay. I don't like it when they squeak, and I'm not the world's     #1 Dixieland fan, but sometimes clarinets sound cool.  Of course, they don't get much play in rock circles,     mostly because you can't hear them over the guitars.  Sometimes they pop up in chamber-pop or twee Beatles     songs.  Clarinets, like their woodwind cousins flute and bassoon, thrive in delicate environments, and in     the right hands, lend a tenderness that's out of range of other instruments.  I think they get a bad rap     because, well, they're not exactly the toughest of instruments, and the little boys who would grow into rock     stars aren't lining up to play them in the high school band.</p>
<p>Slapp Happy liked clarinets-- and pianos, too, and cabaret.  The English and German trio formed in 1972 in     response to minimalist composer Anthony Moore's desire to start a pop band.  He'd already issued a couple     of experimental albums by then, and met singer Dagmar Krause while in Hamburg, Germany.  Krause, who'd     begun singing in nightclubs at 14, had a strong background in traditional German music, cabaret and the     art-song of composers like Kurt Weill.  Her voice, an instantly recognizable alto that often polarizes     listeners, didn't seem obviously suited to pop music, but her range of expression (from silly coo with     wide vibrato to witchy shriek) was perfect for Moore's eclectic pieces.  The third member was Peter Blegvad,     erstwhile associate of Germany's Faust and future creator of the cult British comic <i>Leviathan</i>.     Blegvad didn't come from a classical background as Moore had, but was rather a skewed pop songwriter who     would later find apt partners in Anton Fier and XTC's Andy Partridge.</p>
<p><i>Desperate Straights</i>, a collaboration with British avant-prog band Henry Cow, was Slapp Happy's third     official LP.  The band's first record, <i>Sort Of</i>, had been completed with assistance from Faust, while     their second, self-titled album (later released as <i>Casablanca Moon</i>), was originally recorded for     Polydor but then scrapped and re-recorded when the band signed to Virgin.  Those first two Slapp Happy     records were soft pop for eccentrics, informed by British Invasion rock, Dylan, and hints of European cafe     music.  <i>Desperate Straights</i> was a slightly different story.  Though ""pop"" in a basic sense, its songs     were more closely related to Weill and classical art-song than contemporary pop.  But don't get the wrong     idea: Although Henry Cow members Chris Cutler, Fred Frith, John Greaves, and Tim Hodgkinson contribute     greatly to the baroque sound of the record, Moore and Blegvad's songwriting steal the show.</p>
<p>""Some Questions About Hats"" begins things with a jazz piano chord and Krause's query, ""Can one wear uncanny     hats?""  She poses similarly pressing questions throughout: ""Can one weather hats?"" ""Can one dismiss hats as     simple things? Vapid things? Scat, evanescent things?""  Moore and Blegvad's music favors the delicate-- soft     piano, violin, french horn, Cutler's brushed cymbals, and doubling Krause's vocal with clarinet in a way     similar to Weill's arrangements for his <i>Threepenny Opera</i>.  Greaves' music for ""Bad Alchemy"" is delicate,     too, though with sharply angled melodic lines and snare-heavy percussive accents from Cutler that lend the     piece a martial quality.  Krause describes visions of being a hermaphrodite, views her ""self unmixed"" and     wonders if she is ""neither one nor quite the other.""</p>
<p>Moore provides the instrumental title track, a jazz waltz with blue-nostalgic piano chords and an understated     shuffling accompaniment from Cutler. The music sounds as if it's coming from a deserted club at dawn, after     the wait staff has left and the bartenders are waiting for the band to get bored and go home. Slapp Happy     would have been an interesting bar band; they'd have been kicked out of the rock and blues dives, perhaps     been forced to set up a small stage in front of a coffee shop, playing existential cabaret for tips. ""Apes     in Capes"" is another waltz, subbing out the jazz touches for pointed chamber-rock, and Moore's playful,     nonsensical wordplay: ""Harken child by life beguiled, it's said that some come unsung, Sorry, no song for     some, sing-song's ham-strung.""</p>
<p>In fact, Slapp Happy excelled at being playful. Blegvad's stop-and-go surf rock tune ""Strayed"" laments     losing touch with reality (""Gone into hiding, can't abide the latest tidings from the tribe""), and features     his vocals, sounding like a very happily stoned Lou Reed. The band turns what should be a depressing     trainwreck into something charming, greatly assisted by Frith's faux-Hawaiian guitar asides. Likewise,     their take on Handel's <i>Messiah</i> comes out like an art-school garage band, a far cry from the bloated     classical redux of their proggy contemporaries. In fact, the only time <i>Desperate Straights</i> approaches     ""bloated"" at all is on its instrumental closer, ""Caucasian Lullaby"", a lengthy, dissonant piece that recalls     both Brian Eno's early ambient records and Henry Cow's live improvisations.</p>
<p>Slapp Happy disbanded after this album, with Krause, Cutler and Frith eventually forming the considerably     more experimental Art Bears.  However, Krause, Blegvad, and Moore reformed the band in the late 90s,     updating their sound with drum loops and digitally enhanced production, but unfortunately toning down most     of the idiosyncrasies that made records like <i>Desperate Straights</i> so cool. Still, their work in the     70s stands as some of the most unique and interesting ""pop"" of the era, and anyone into pushing the     chamber-pop envelope should search for this album in particular.</p></div>"|7780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7780-desperate-straights-with-henry-cow/|8.2|Dominique Leone

    factories that clanged together modern America's crux of survival.  Later, Kraftwerk's ""machine-music""
    romanticized the autobahn as a symphony where the daydreamers forget destinations and accident risks.
    Somehow dub reggae is lost in this discussion.  Machines made classic dub possible.  King Tubby and Lee
    ""Scratch"" Perry employed tape speeds, echoplexes, and delay boxes to mutate traditional reggae into
    after-hours hallucinations.  The dub rhythm's traditional Caribbean element of hitting right on the four
    and nearly missing the beat, arguably resembles a machine worn by years of dried grease and friction.</p><p>
    
    Michael Campitelli (Calamalka) mostly captures dub's factory life in <i>Shredders Dub</i>.  The Vancouverian's
    debut album has a rich atmosphere that inhabits a rehearsal space tucked underneath a junk-shop's trapdoor.
    Blistered hands master the music's craftsmanship. The raw beats are usually thwacked on a live trapkit like
    a sledgehammer-- quite a relief from the bald-shaven drum machines heard in so much digital-dub.  The live
    basslines maintain a steady groove without either deafening the room or falling flat.  Campitelli also avoids
    cluttering his lysergic excursions with the debris of aimless guitar strums and B-flick inspired ""cosmic""
    noises that infest like flu germs.  However, he's still faithful to dub's common dreariness and stubborn
    hope for salvation.</p><p>
    
    Half of <i>Shredders</i>' tunes are meant to shout through a car's disintegrating subwoofers in the dead of
    night.  ""Hear the Most"" sets this mood by throwing the listener out into the moonless streets that, no matter
    the loneliness, are never empty.  A distant funeral bell marks the time, as the ring-modulated voices whisper
    in one's ear, and the bass and snares stomp their feet like a stalker picking up the pace behind you.  In
    keeping with <i>Shredders</i>' other bludgeoning raveups, those same footsteps could be mistaken for factories.
    ""Chassi"" connects dub to thrash and funk with distorted bass, a cement-shoed hip-hop rhythm, and a Rhodes
    that honks through a gridlock.  The equally sinister ""Bumpea"" broods on the E-string with switchbladed
    rimshots and an orbiting satellite that recovers a lost broadcast of a keyboard played at a 1970 Miles
    Davis Fillmore gig.  If Campitelli woke up a bit during the stiff drum solo that ends the song, he'd be a
    richer man.  But machines can't change their minds.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Shredders</i> steps away from the industrial dogpatches and floats in a narcotic haze,
    sometimes finding beauty and sometimes waiting too long to exhale.  The best is ""Lighting Rigg"", whose
    jazz-guitar riffs bloom like sunshine through the gray Atlantic.  ""Electric Blue"" also picks up that vibe
    and drizzles microtones upon the sea.  Too bad Campitelli is too complacent to swim up to the surface, as
    he deadpans under deep medication, ""I am what it is be reliable,"" in the otherwise engrossing ""Reliable I"".
    The album's weakest moment, ""Gamblor"", is a rather dour and cumbersome space-out that doesn't pick up until
    minute seven-- though extra brownie points go to the song title's <i>Simpsons</i> reference, a brief instance
    of comic relief that lightens <i>Shredders Dub</i>'s carefully crafted claustrophobia.</p></div>"|1783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1783-shredders-dub/|8.0|Cameron Macdonald

On a friend's glowing recommendation,     I picked up Hem's debut LP and it found itself a permanent place in my listening rotation for the next few     years.  Not only is it a work of enduring craft but also an accomplishment of accessibility, embraced by     an audience spanning a huge range of ages and tastes. Widely overlooked on its release, it grew through     word of mouth and a small amount of press until finally being reissued on Dreamworks last year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hem's latest full-length, <i>Eveningland</i>, trades in their chamber-folk sound for a     decidedly Boston Pops meets Nashville sessions feel-- or, as bandleader Dan Messe has (positively) called     it, ""country-politan."" Oh well. Fans of a more stripped-down Hem can take small refuge in <i>Birds, Beasts     &amp; Flowers</i>, a split EP with Wilco bassist John Stirratt's project Autumn Defense in which the two bands     alternate three tracks apiece.  They both showcase sounds that gesture toward earlier American music, meeting     halfway between the humbler side of Hem and ornate side of Autumn Defense.</p>
<p>The album begins with a Radio Denmark version of <i>Rabbit Songs</i> highlight ""Half Acre"".  Its pace is     slowed, with piano and banjo intertwining around each other and the added orchestral accents of strings,     timpani, and cymbal.  Autumn Defense's ""Bluebirds Fall"" follows, a melodic, Zombies-like track accented     with a distorted organ.  That same 1960s pop tinge is also showcased on their ""You Know Where I Live"", which     features a harpsichord and sunny harmonies.  Hem offers an arrangement of one of <i>Eveningland</i>'s better     selections, the wistful lounge-country ballad ""Pacific Street"".  The album closes with a piano and     vibraphone-driven instrumental track from Autumn Defense, ""Mayday"", a piece that's well-arranged but lacks     a strong melody.</p>
<p><i>Birds, Beasts, &amp; Flowers</i> isn't a remarkable release.  Both of these acts have a lot of potential     (partly realized in Hem's first album) and are a step or two away from beautifully synthesizing a vast     array of American music genres that are often hijacked by mediocre artists. But both are headed in     directions that suggest they're taken with the silly <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>Uncut</i> quotes plastered     on this EP's cover sticker-- Hem are ""sophisticated and sexy"" and Autumn Defense are ""comfort music for     the soul.""  So perhaps I'm the one not getting it-- maybe what I see as promise, these bands view as an edge     that needs muting.  I hope not.  At their best, they prove themselves capable of a fresh and moving take on     well-trod territory.</p></div>"|3993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3993-birds-beasts-flowers-ep-split-with-autumn-defense/|6.8|Liam Singer

    or a vacation, a productive retreat to perhaps an artists' commune or an off-season spent at a remote hideaway.
    But Abaddon is not the name of a small coastal town or a resort near the Poconos: Deriving from Hebrew, it
    refers to the pits of hell, a place of annihilation and destruction where its dwellers become unimaginably
    small and brutally insignificant.  The word is also the name of the angel/demon who reigns over this kingdom
    of pitch; he is death incarnate.</p><p>
    
    It's a word pendulously heavy with slithery meaning, but Pinback's album isn't about physical suffering.  For
    the band's two mainstays-- Armistead Burwell Smith IV, formerly of 3 Mile Pilot, and Rob Crow (Thingy and
    ex-Heavy Vegetable)-- hell is creative stagnation.  It is the inability to make music.  Surprisingly,
    <i>Summer in Abaddon</i>, the band's first release for Touch &amp; Go, is arguably their best record yet, a
    logical and accessible realization of a sound they've been developing for more than six years.</p><p>
    
    Appropriately, the album plays as a chronicle of time wasted; its songs are full of romantic cul-de-sacs,
    barroom blackouts, and crossword puzzles.  The disc opens with ""Non Photo-Blue"", an image of modern futility:
    ""She's posting all the time, but the boards are down.""  ""Fortress"" describes a ""sick summer in bed,"" spending
    ""days with the light off, freezing.""  Death looms over ""Bloods on Fire"", as Crow and Smith eulogize a friend:
    ""Here's to the pranks we never pulled/ And never will.""  Yet, while <i>Summer in Abaddon</i> is bleak, it's
    not without an appropriately dark and self-effacing sense of humor, one best glimpsed in the chorus of ""This
    Red Book"": ""I could strangle you all/ Did I say that out loud?""</p><p>
    
    If the lyrics recount endless unproductive hours, then Pinback's music steadily ticks off the seconds and
    minutes.  The band-- which on this release also includes Kenseth Thibideau, Cameron Jones, and Ryan Bromley--
    has always been rhythmically tight, but on <i>Summer in Abaddon</i>, they sound clockwork precise: The drums,
    guitars, and bass lock together like cogs turning against each other: one moving the next moving the next
    moving until they form a Mobius strip groove.  If ""Sender"" didn't fade out, the instrumental interplay could
    imaginably go on for months until its gears finally wound down.  Even the name Pinback-- taken from the
    sci-fi movie <i>Dark Star</i>-- suggests something mechanical, like a wind-up robot.</p><p>
    
    On the first few songs of <i>Summer in Abaddon</i>, there seem to be few sustained notes outside of voice
    and background synths; instead, the emphasis is on points of sound.  At times, the songs evoke the rapid
    fire of synapses as the brain develops a series of ideas.  Such a precise sound suggests clinical, cloistered
    detachment, a self-imposed isolation of extreme introversion.  However, as the album progresses, it grows
    slightly more lush and louder-- albeit it no less dynamic or desolate.  ""The Yellow Ones"" sets a ponderous
    piano line against ever-steady drum beats and whistling keyboards, creating a hushed nocturne.  By contrast,
    ""AFK"" ends the album with an aggressive and maybe even outraged punk energy, as if Crow and Smith are trying
    to will their way out of the abyss.</p><p>
    
    Compared to earlier Pinback songs such as ""June"" and ""Some Voices"", the 10 tracks on <i>Summer in Abaddon</i>
    initially sound less dramatic; the band has opted to convey their ideas and emotions through subtle implication
    and impressionistic lyrics.  Despite the tremendous metaphysical weight they carry, the songs glide by with
    an unhindered fluidity, verses unceremoniously giving way to choruses and back again.  The dynamics are often
    subdued, but Pinback aren't emotionally distant as much as indirect.  If the album is the product of wasted
    time, it does not reflect that waste.  And therein lies the knotty paradox at the heart of <i>Summer in Abaddon</i>:
    Pinback's darkest hours have inspired their finest moment.</p></div>"|6299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6299-summer-in-abaddon/|8.1|Stephen M. Deusner

Relocated from the American South
    to southern Spain, Herren fell in love with Barcelonan culture and music and recycled his former post-rock
    alias, Savath &amp; Savalas, as an interpreter of Catalan folk music with this year's <i>Apropa't</i> LP.  On
    paper, it sounded as if Herren would be applying his unique micro-editing CTRL-X/CTRL-V talents to another
    land's musical heritage, having already reprocessed the American tropes of jazz and hip-hop under his flagship
    moniker, Prefuse 73.  Instead, Herren put his skittering rhythms in storage and produced a much softer album,
    like a romantic evening over a bottle of Rioja, a pot of paella, and sundry other stereotypically Spanish
    things.</p><p>
    For those who thought they could forecast Herren's tactics, <i>Apropa't</i> was a surprise and, very likely,
    a disappointment.  (""Oh gross, is this <em>world music</em>?!?"")  Yet the project accomplished what Herren
    himself was likely looking to do: introduce his fans to the Catalan music of S&amp;S; singer Eva Puyuelo Muns
    with a minimum of distraction and interpretation.</p><p>
    But Herren has built a career on recontextualization-- be it of dusty vinyl excavations or his own compositions--
    and this follow-up EP gives him space to exercise those strengths.  2003's <i>Extinguished</i> EP built a
    banquet out of leftovers from Prefuse 73's <i>One Word Extinguisher</i> album, mixing stray beats and found
    sound into a fully-developed companion piece.  <i>Mañana</i> is also a re-imagination of source material;
    it's eight original songs that spin the Barcelona travelogue of <i>Apropa't</i> in a new direction.</p><p>
    The first element one hears on <i>Mañana</i> is a cut-up, hiccuping vocal sample-- an immediate indication
    that Herren is using the EP to inject his Prefuse 73 methodology into the Savath &amp; Savalas sound.  Though
    the track is titled ""Interludio Inconcreto"", it might as well be an overture for the half-hour of music to
    follow.  A beat-less swirl of abrupt string swells and disconnected syllables, the piece retains the hazy
    atmosphere of <i>Apropa't</i> while happily shirking traditional instrumentation and arrangement.  ""Demà
    Vindrà"" accomplishes a similar feat, preserving the whispery vocals of Herren and Muns that dominate
    <i>Apropa't</i> but sautéing them on a bed of sampled string-plucks, static crackles, and headphone-hopping
    ooo's.</p><p>
    Less subtle is ""Sota L'Aigüa"", on which an initial passage of soft singing and gentle backwards loops runs
    headlong into a surprise appearance by the kind of beat programming tweaked to perfection on <i>One Word
    Extinguisher</i>.  For two minutes, this drum flurry gives Herren's Barcelonan project its strongest backbone,
    adding helpful variety to what was oftentimes on <i>Apropa't</i> a sound too weightless to leave an
    impression.  ""No Puedo de Cidir"" is no less jarring when placed alongside traditional compositions; it
    sounds like a Tortoise outtake got mixed in with the S&amp;S; masters at John McEntire's Soma Studios.</p><p>
    The EP crests with ""Equipatage de Flors Seques"", wherein Herren gets all ""Revolution 9"" on his Barcelona
    period by pitting tetherless piano ramblings against loop fuckery that only coalesces for one short stretch.
    It's an intentionally disorienting take on the indigenous music at the project's core, and one wonders what
    Herren's collaborator Muns thinks of the final product-- and whether it's a coincidence that <i>Mañana</i>
    is rumored to be their final collaboration.  But it's difficult to ignore that the track is far more
    interesting and dense than anything on <i>Apropa't</i>, at least to this typically foreign-culture-ignorant
    American.  <i>Mañana</i> finds Herren working up the nerve to interpret the music of his adopted Spanish
    home instead of merely documenting it, and the results allow the EP to easily outshine its shy big brother.</p></div>"|7009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7009-manana/|7.4|Rob Mitchum

    Aaron Espinoza's quaint impulses, his artisan's fussiness over detail, and the record's texture.  The resulting
    wistful, buzzy rock effortlessly absorbed the past 20 or so years of sonic gadgetry (synths, loops, filters,
    tuneless noise as a legitimate arrangement option), and accommodated them all within a sturdy folk-flecked
    framework.  And if it sounded like countless other records by countless other bands, there always remained
    a colorless, odorless component of intelligent craftsmanship.</i></p><p>
    
    The same holds true for <i>Treble &amp; Tremble.  It's starting to piss me off.  Writing about Earlimart
    in the context of the current indie landscape is like explaining why Grey Goose is a better spirit than
    Popov: It comes down to the feeling you have after you've finished them.</i></p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Hold on Slow Down""-- a ballad of floating wispy, hollowed-out vocals over basic but grand
    Lennon-esque piano chords-- is a bit of a sequel to ""The Movies"", the standout track on <i>Everyone Down
    Here.  It's a good, honest gambit, especially since Espinoza is not a great singer-- as he appears
    well aware.  The album's title is a serviceable description of Espinoza's vocal style.  He has a standard
    indie rock head voice, which he treats as a producer's auto-challenge: </i><i>Treble and Tremble showcases
    a full array of old-school remedies, from inventive mic'ing and overdubbing to brutal filters and bullhorn
    distortion a la Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse.  If Espinoza sang any better than he does, he'd probably be
    bored in the studio.</i></p><p>
    
    ""First Instant Last Report"" finds Earlimart at their most accessible and fun, which is also, paradoxically,
    their weakest.  It's these upbeat strummy songs, with their PB&amp;J; pairing of guitar crunch and keys, that
    betray the band's recent mentorship by Grandaddy (whom Earlimart are otherwise poised to outgrow).  Once
    again, the best tracks are the darker ones.  ""Heaven Adores You"" begins in stupor and ends in catharsis:
    Toward its end, a gorgeous string riff careens from nowhere to snap everything into place like a tiny
    <i>deus ex machina</i>.  And the rococo lead guitar on ""Broke the Furniture"" raises the reasonable question:
    Why aren't more indie guitarists ripping off George Harrison?  (Oh, right: They can't.)</p><p>
    
    Espinoza is neither a bad lyricist nor an ambitious one, dealing primarily in complete neutralities (e.g.
    ""I lost my way/ In trying to find/ Somewhere else to stay"").  Yet there's an intriguing abundance of
    professional self-reflection on display here.  Like the album's name, most song titles also refer to
    music, songwriting, and-- crucially-- recording.  There's ""The Hidden Track"" (which the band proudly places
    third in the LP's running order), ""A Bell and a Whistle"", ""Sounds"", and ""Unintentional Tape Manipulations""--
    all traditional verse/chorus/verse songs.  Elsewhere are references to songs being out of key-- ""808 Crickets"",
    which likely refers to the drum machine rather than, say, an insect count, quotes a device from Earlimart's
    recent tour: The band used a constant cricket-noise background loop at its concerts, conjuring up an odd,
    hushed environment.</p><p>
    
    A dime-store Freud analysis of Espinoza's preoccupations will tell you the same thing the album itself is
    desperate to relate: Earlimart like music, so they make music about music.  In a genre beset by extra-musical
    agendas-- and in an all-in-the-context age of churning trend cycles and ironic revivals-- this is an approach
    that could catch us off guard and perplexed.  But that sure as hell isn't Earlimart's fault.</p></div>"|2653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2653-treble-tremble/|8.0|Michael Idov

For the     first few minutes of album opener ""Well-Heeled Man"", Josephine Foster lips pretty whatnots over sparse guitar     action, echoing both her work with Jason Ajemian as Born Heller and ""Little Life"", her stand out contribution     to Devendra Banhart's recent neo-folk compilation <i>Golden Apples of the Sun</i>.  And then the serpent     rears its head: Drums roll, cymbals crash, acoustic guitars fight an electric improvisational warrior--     from pretty much herein, <i>All the Leaves Are Gone</i> is a bloodthirsty rock album, hot and curdling     till the last man bites the Martian grass.</p>
<p>Moving from ""sparse Appalachian folk"" to ""bloodthirsty rock"" seems like a huge gap not to mind, but the     protean Foster proves she can do either of them convincingly.  On her own, she acquires the intimate     affectations of Shirley Collins with a weird twist of opera bravado; with the support of backing band     The Supposed, Foster remains operatic but the excess rock energy triggers her Joan Baez and Cat Power     reflexes.  All of which is to say: Foster's vocal range-- vertically or theatrically-- never poses any     issues here.  The Old Dawson Prater Wives' Tale that Foster originally conceived <i>All the Leaves Are     Gone</i> as a rock musical doesn't seem out of the question: Foster's empowered delivery makes her hooks     stick even more than in her sparser outfits, as if the whole album is designed to be whistle-worthy fare     for departing theatergoers.  It would not surprise if some indie rock visionary takes Foster's songs     here and writes a brilliant accompanying stage play.</p>
<p>Until that time, the songs alone will more than suffice.  The album's title track offers its own antidote     for the bleak house it pitches (""There is no end to your sorrow"") with an Eastern-tinged electric guitar     closely trailing Foster's matter-of-fact melody until the two miraculously consummate.  ""Deathknell"" is     surprisingly amelodic for Foster-- the vocals stay buried deep in her throat-- but the choice is disastrously     effective, lending a sense of dread to Foster's anxious chorus, ""I had a mother, mother had a mother, no     one remembers their name.""  Foster and The Supposed run circles around themselves on the blazing ""Jailbird     (Hero of the Sorrow)"", which teems with electric guitar-vocal counterpoint and innumerably distinct mega-riffs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, The Supposed's electric guitarist can be pretty annoying.  It's unclear who he thinks he is,     or what band he thinks he's in, or what song he thinks he's jazzing up on tracks like ""Who Will Feel Better     at the Days End?"", which starts promisingly with double-plucks snatched off Tim Buckley's <i>Starsailor</i> but degenerates into high-speed wankery reminiscent of the high school pit band guitarist who doesn't know     how to read music, so he ""just plays whatever.""  The same problem exists on ""The Most Loved One"" and album     closer ""(You Are Worth) A Million Dollars"": The guy is clearly well trained, but his improvisations more     than often detract from Foster, who is (deservedly) the principal here.  Let's not quibble, though: <i>All     the Leaves Are Gone</i> is theatrical, occasionally vaudevillian, and-- like Foster's earlier offerings this     year-- is never wasteful or impassionate.</p></div>"|3324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3324-all-the-leaves-are-gone-with-the-supposed/|7.7|Nick Sylvester

    Before the salt is tasted in the sugar, this L.A.-based jazz-hop unit unveils several nourishing, leftfield
    instrumental grooves.  But when Sol Uprising's Lil Sci delivers a laser-cut rap on the record's final track--
    one that would perfectly complement the opener, instrumental space-out ""Dreamy""-- the absence of MCs becomes
    glaring and the album suddenly seems like a collection of missed opportunities.  Or, as Lil Sci puts it:
    ""That's why I don't judge until I hear the half of the half.""  <i>One in an Infinity of Ways</i>, indeed.
    In all fairness, the incomplete-art element is what Ammoncontact's Carlos Niño and Fabian Ammon are possibly
    reaching for on their second album, as hip-hop and psychedelic jazz instrumentals are often left 50% done
    for future remixing and rapping.  However, when producers can neither afford a set of guests nor rhyme worth
    a damn, most of the music simply falls in the background-- for good or ill.</p><p>
    That said, ""Dreamy"" falls into the good, and it can leave one seeing purple, red, and orange spots everywhere
    the eye glances.  Bedroom-techno dandy Daedelus supplies the bass clarinet thrumps and acoustic guitar licks
    that dart about while a flute sample melts the cortex.  As previously mentioned, the inclusion of Lil Sci's
    laidback rhymes about keeping your chin up during adversity may could proven that psychedelica can sell
    almost any public service announcement.  Unfortunately, other choice MC spots also turn up two cherries
    with each pull of the slots.</p><p>
    ""Healing Vibrations"" has a looped Afro-jazz beat that nearly rivals the Apache break before Niño and Ammon
    seamlessly let the music nod off into a 2 a.m. jazz trance courtesy of bassist/guitarist Greg Malone and
    skinsman Andres Renteria.  It's one of many moments when Ammoncontact successfully blur the line between
    the sampler and live instruments.  The three-part ""Infinity of Rhythm Instrumental"" knocks listeners awake
    with a bludgeon by conga before settling into a methanol haze with downtempo Rhodes funk.  Other fine tracks
    include the P-Funk bounce of, ahem, ""Fun Is for Funky"" and the robotic funk of ""Wu Woomp Whoomp"", which
    struggles to escape the length of its two-foot power cord.</p><p>
    Prefuse 73's Scott Herren has called Ammoncontact's sound ""machine funk,"" yet it's one that is devoid of
    poetry.  Bare-boned throwaways ""Through the Moon"" and ""Wu Wu Woomp"" (you read right) drag a tepid hip-hop
    beat around in circles-- dying for the verses of any li'l Johnny who found God in the Gospel according to
    Emniem.  ""Like Waves of the Sea"" has a swank Latin-jazz bass riff that sadly goes nowhere, while the
    staccato orchestral tease ""Ballad of the Untitled"" sounds too incomplete to even count as a lock-groove
    piece.  The demand for an emcee savior is exacerbated with every listen.</p><p>
    The nagging title <i>One in an Infinity of Ways</i> implies that Ammoncontact are capable of greater good,
    and they would've left the listener with a remarkable batch of abstract sketches-- if Lil Sci hadn't exposed
    the nudity of it all.  I can't wait for the remixes to hopefully correct things.</p></div>"|455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/455-one-in-an-infinity-of-ways/|6.9|Cameron Macdonald

    To: Charles Thompson, aka Black Francis, aka Frank Black<br/>
    Re: Messing with the gospel</p><p>
    
    Dude, you worry way too much.</p><p>
    
    Sincerely,<br/>
    --a fan</p><p>
    
    You can say this for Frank Black: The man cares about his fans.  The liner notes for his archival record
    <i>Frank Black Francis</i>-- the latest in his long string of solo albums, but the first to sport <i>both</i>
    of his stage names simultaneously and focus on Pixies material-- fret almost comically that the album will
    either not provide listeners value for their money, or will anger them because he's chosen to tamper with
    his classic material.</p><p>
    
    Well, there's certainly no question that his concerns are well-founded.  The first disc-- a set of solo
    acoustic demos Black recorded at producer Gary Smith's Allston, Mass., apartment before the Pixies hit the
    studio for their legendary first sessions at Fort Apache-- isn't going to speak to anyone who doesn't already
    know the material inside and out.  Those who do, however, will no doubt lose their shit for a chance to hear
    these naked versions of some of the best-loved Pixies songs.  Black's stated concern that the quality of the
    recordings is too bootleg is actually misplaced.  Although it was recorded into Smith's cassette Walkman with
    nothing more than a little reverb added, the tape sounds startlingly fresh and clear.  Plus, Black's disarming
    asides and spirited performance give the recordings a verve that helps them stand up well in the face of the
    canonical final versions that we've all played half to death (they're too good to ever really be killed).</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, the second disc-- newly recorded version of 13 Pixies tracks-- is a total oddity.  Many
    listeners who will salivate while the first disc spins might find themselves choking back the bile while
    listening to the second. Our relationship with the artists who change us the most are funny things, and
    hearing the songs of one of those bands as radically re-interpreted as they are here can be jarring, even
    upsetting, if you don't keep an open mind about it.  Black, mostly independent of the rest of the Pixies
    (Joey Santiago does pop in for ""additional editing""), re-recorded these stone-cold Pixies classics with Two
    Pale Boys, veterans of collaboration with Pere Ubu's David Thomas, and as re-workings go, these amount to
    total detonations of their forebears.</p><p>
    
    Once you get past the fact that you're hearing ""Subbacultcha"" re-imagined as a Tom Waits-ian electro-acoustic
    coffee shop rant or ""Caribou"" as if it dropped out of Wayne Coyne's back pocket, Black and the Boys-- known
    to their mothers as Andy Diagram and Keith Moline-- actually have done a pretty interesting job of ""messing
    with the gospel,"" as Black puts it in his liners.  It's not all successful, however: ""Velouria"" is tragically
    slaughtered by a lugubrious pace and intestinal bass, while ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" needs the Pixies' mayhem
    more than the bendy elasto-synths it gets here.  And the limping ambient version of ""Where Is My Mind?"" is
    what I imagine being killed with plastic cocktail swords would be like.</p><p>
    
    But three strikeouts in 13 at-bats won't necessarily lose you a game, and the mind-bending readings of
    ""Caribou"" and ""Nimrod's Son"" are home runs that help to validate the endeavor.  ""Caribou"" finds Black's
    falsetto in unusually supple, tender form as a whirling electronic background swells and pulses with his
    every vocal tic, while ""Nimrod's Son"" becomes seasick burlesque wrapped in a dubby echo.  ""Wave of Mutilation""
    playfully nods to the <i>Doolittle</i> arrangement as ""waves"" of manipulated static wash over the chorus.
    Is there anything here that bests or equals an original?  Absolutely not, but at least the trio land some
    punches and go down swinging.</p><p>
    
    Back on Disc 1, ""Caribou"" positively burns with razor-throated intensity, even as Black quickly explains to
    Smith, ""I'm supposed to be screaming here,"" and then veers off into wild shrieks and alley cat noises.  He
    does his best to convey the basic outline of the weird ""Broken Face"" intro, but otherwise gives the song a
    good, rapid-fire run-through, and his Spanish accent is remarkably authentic on both ""Vamos"" and ""Isla de
    Encanta"".  In all my years of listening to Black surrounded by other guitarists, I don't think it ever
    occurred to me how much facility the man himself has with the six-string.  Here, his percussive strumming,
    odd picking patterns, and animated runs are impressive, often providing clues to these song's eventual
    arrangements.</p><p>
    
    If you've read this far and you're not familiar with the Pixies' studio albums, please understand that under
    no circumstances should you begin your acquaintance with the band's material here.  There are whole Pixies
    albums for that, and they're all worth owning.  Those of you who have been with the band since the days of
    torn flannel and <i>120 Minutes</i> are obviously the target audience of this release, which is a thoughtful
    presentation of what essentially was the final unreleased material in the Pixies vault.  The second disc is
    ultimately little more than a curiosity for most-- and will no doubt be complete anathema for some-- but
    given that the entire package retails for a single-disc price, that's hardly a reason for a die-hard to opt
    out.  The fact is, as a fan, I enjoyed the hell out of hearing Black's demos, and my guess is you will too.</p></div>"|784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/784-frank-black-francis/|7.4|Joe Tangari

    along the way.  The unbruised adolescent ego likes its angst to be clear-cut and attributable to the denigrations
    of an insouciant universe.  Emotional complexity engenders too much unpleasant introspection and not enough
    pat catharsis.  But this very trammel to superstardom has made AMC's longevity and continuing dynamism possible,
    and their first new album in 10 years, <em>Love Songs for Patriots</em>, is not only just as hearty as their
    earliest work, but it profits from another decade of experience grimed into its leathery creases.</p><p>
<em>Love Songs for Patriots</em> is a uniformly strong collection of sharp-eyed, sardonic allegories.  Its
    first three tracks-- ""Ladies and Gentleman"", ""Another Morning"", and ""Patriot's Heart""-- demonstrate what
    AMC does better than almost anyone else: an elusive blend of gruff, shimmering music, understated drama,
    intuitive dynamics, and effortlessly poignant lyrics that burrow into the profane idealism at the heart of
    the American dream.  Frontman Mark Eitzel's words are timeless and complicated, and sad without celebrating
    sadness: They acknowledge its inevitability while screaming defiantly into its sullen face. </p><p>
    
    On ""Ladies and Gentlemen"", Eitzel is the archetypal barroom prophet, a pale figure kicking up sawdust in a
    dark, smoky room and summoning spirits into the leaden air.  A brewing storm of heavily distorted chords,
    sculpted feedback, and detuned piano rumble beneath him.  The consummate showman, Eitzel moans and shouts
    as the music lurches through segments of stark lounge and roiling disarray, issuing a plainspoken demand
    for redemption through honesty: ""Ladies and gentlemen, it's time/ The bartender is looking you right in the
    eye/ Says I'm going to replace all your weak blood with my wine/ If you can't live with the truth with the
    truth/ Go ahead, try to live with a lie."" </p><p>
    
    ""Another Morning"" is more subdued, a well-sequenced mote of gossamer pop after the breathless claustrophobia
    of ""Ladies and Gentlemen"".  Over a lovely bed of iridescent reverb, wafting acoustic guitar, and pliable
    percussion, Eitzel gently goads an unnamed ""you"" for her addiction to depression: ""Someone does you wrong,
    you give away your whole life to prove it/ You wear your pain with pride, you refuse to remove it/ You
    become the evil that plays with you like a doll/ Big rooms only make our lives small.""  Delivered with less
    grace, the lines would seem mean-spirited and petty, but Eitzel breathes them out with such sympathy and
    tenderness that they become less an indictment than a prayer for deliverance. </p><p>
    
    Rounding out the trio is the commanding ""Patriot's Heart"".  Another character sketch, it's a scathing... I
    almost said ""indictment"" again, but that's not quite right: There's no sense of accusation or self-righteousness
    embedded in the song.  Instead, it's weary, defeated but still standing, and profoundly empathetic toward
    its subject, a male stripper whose transformation from person to icon embodies the downfall of a culture
    that's lost its heart to materialism.  Over plodding crests and sloughs of bone-tired, ragged bar-rock,
    Eitzel gradually transfigures his protagonist from a debased yet essentially human soul into a symbolic
    reservoir for the sum total of untenable desire (""After a few tequilas, I become something holy""), culminating
    in the dissolution of maligned dignity.  ""I'm the past you wasted/ I'm the future you're obliterating/ Come
    on grandpa, remind me what we're celebrating."" </p><p>
    
    The rest of the record continues to chart the shadowy regions of the spirit.  Eitzel displays good-natured,
    satiric humor on the lulling, quiet ballad ""Myopic Books"", simple wisdom on the twinkling night-song ""Love
    Is"" (""We're so small compared to our hearts""), and undiluted, romantic hope on the breezy ""Only Love Can
    Set You Free"".  Reviews of long-running bands often close by recommending that you check out their more salient
    back-catalog first, but I'm happy to say that the wonderfully humane and genuine <em>Love Songs for Patriots</em>
    is as fine a point of entry into their massive oeuvre as any.</p></div>"|454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/454-love-songs-for-patriots/|8.0|Brian Howe

    Artists with the talent and vision to develop an identifiable sound sometimes have difficulty breaking
    away from it.  A minute into ""Acéphale""-- the first track on <i>Mirages</i>-- I knew instantly that I was
    listening to a Tim Hecker album.  His distinctive layering of crackly digital static, mournful swoons of
    drone, and rumbling bottom is easy to source if you're familiar with either of his previous records, last
    year's <i>Radio Amor</i> or 2001's <i>Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again</i>.  ""Acéphale"" opens with an
    extended twist of death metal guitar (an element that repeats periodically throughout the album), a welcome
    and appropriate addition to the Hecker palette, but the song is still unmistakably his work.</p><p>
    But is it a bad thing to have a unique sonic ID?  Abstract electronic music gains intimacy when a producer
    has a specific voice-- the imagined personality on the other side of the laptop becomes clearer and more
    distinct.  The downside is that it can be unnerving to closely follow an artist's career over the long term
    when one release sounds quite similar to the next, even if the quality level remains high (see Boards of
    Canada).</p><p>
    Which isn't to say there are no differences between <i>Mirages</i> and its predecessors.  This is Hecker's
    most subtle and flowing record, as well as the least ""musical.""  While <i>Haunt Me</i> retained traces of
    Hecker's techno roots (particularly in its use of repetition) and <i>Radio Amor</i> experimented with harsher
    sounds and unusual use of piano, <i>Mirages</i> is a unified ambient suite, swallowing dark shades of gnarled
    guitar and exaggerated bass.</p><p>
    The keyboard parts on <i>Mirages are prettier, and the overall mood is more contemplative, but there's
    a deep pit of melancholy at the center of the record, a mood with a strongly cumulative effect.  Unlike
    Fennesz-- to whom he is often compared (a reference that, as the Austrian producer shifts his musical focus,
    makes less sense than it used to)-- it's impossible to imagine Hecker in terms of single tracks.  His music
    strives for endlessness and needs to be digested over the length of an album.  On Hecker's albums, you never
    even know for certain where one title ends and another begins.</i></p><p>
    Another new wrinkle is collaboration: Oren Ambarchi (who has worked with Fennesz, among others) adds guitar
    to ""Kaito""-- one of the record's best tracks, a song that fuses Ambarchi's trademark slow and measured tones
    with Hecker's cluttered midrange.  Fly Pan Am add an industrial clang to ""Aerial Silver"", and David Bryant
    adds guitar (mostly in the form of feedback) to the 10-minute closer ""Incurably Optimistic!"".</p><p>
    This final track is also the perfect illustration of the potential problem with trademark sounds within
    abstract electronic music.  ""Incurably Optimistic!"" could be mixed into the center of <i>Haunt Me</i> and
    no one who hadn't heard that album would know the difference.  And yet, it's also perhaps Hecker's finest
    single moment, with a crushingly sad organ melody reminiscent of a funeral service that gradually gives
    way to oblong piles of guitar distortion.  ""Incurably Optimistic!"" is such a gorgeous track-- and such a
    fine end to this thoroughly enjoyable record-- that I have to wonder: With music this moving and
    well-constructed, can we fault Hecker for repeating himself?</p></div>"|3799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3799-mirages/|7.9|Mark Richardson

    people immediately and burned their shadows onto floors and walls.  There are scientific reasons for this
    phenomenon, but it carries such a strong metaphorical punch that it carries a depth of meaning even beyond
    its empirical explanation: Humans-- and humanity-- are easily lost amid the collisions of countries and
    ideologies.</p><p>
    
    That Joseph Arthur has titled his fourth album <i>Our Shadows Will Remain</i> reveals his own conflicted
    emotions about life during wartime.  On one hand, his fourth full-length album-- and first after parting
    ways with longtime label Real World and signing with Vector Recordings-- is informed by terror-era jitteriness,
    a fear of something worse than death: abject annihilation.  Clashing with this paranoia, cynicism, grief,
    and disbelief, however, is Arthur's wavering optimism.  The bright blast that vaporizes him may not be a
    terrorist's bomb, but the Rapture.  A strong believer in God and an afterlife, he nevertheless fears death.</p><p>
    
    Always more naively sincere boho than detached hipster, Arthur left his apartment studio in his adopted hometown
    of New York and decamped to the relative safety of New Orleans to record <i>Our Shadows Will Remain</i>.  The
    resulting album is not a drastic departure, but it does sound more expansive-- both geographically and musically.
    There seems to be a lot of distance in the album, as Arthur evokes both the Midwest (the brief ""In Ohio"") and
    Los Angeles (""Echo Park""), not to mention New Orleans and New York.</p><p>
    
    Arthur fills this space with music that melds the homemade beats of his one-man <i>Come to Where I'm From</i>
    with the live-band sound of <i>Redemption's Son</i>.  The Prague Philharmonic Orchestra injects three songs
    with swooping strings and nervy anxiety.  In contrast, drums detonate throughout ""Stumble and Pain"", creating
    an apocalyptic march.  Arthur layers his vocals heavily on most tracks, harmonizing with an infinite regression
    of selves.  On his first duet, ""A Smile That Explodes"""", he sings with New Zealand singer Julia Darling, whose
    crystalline voice dramatically offsets his grainy tenor and lends the song a somber, defeated tone.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, <i>Our Shadows Will Remain</i> is similarly moody and conflicted.  While not as claustrophobic
    (or as bold) as <i>Come to Where I'm From</i>, it's much less hopeful and uplifting than <i>Redemption's
    Son</i>, which is significant: The progression in two years from hard-won optimism to bleak pessimism seems
    to mirror the national unraveling of post-9/11 solidarity into deep disillusionment and disgust in response
    to the invasion of Iraq.</p><p>
    
    But current events only partially inform <i>Our Shadows Will Remain</i>, providing a context for these songs
    but not necessarily a subject.  Despite the plural pronoun in its title, this is a deeply personal record.
    In fact, as if mirroring his move from New York, the album at times sounds as though Arthur's main subject
    is retreat-- from society, from home, from friends and especially lovers.  ""I wanna try,"" he sings on ""Puppets"",
    ""to get away from everybody else.""  The album ends with the blunt command ""Leave Us Alone"".</p><p>
    
    Here, as on previous albums, Arthur demonstrates his gift for emotionally direct songwriting, but the
    specifics often escape his attention.  Occasionally, a lyric rings false, relies on cliche, sounds clumsily
    vague, or simply tries too hard (""like a ghost without an atmosphere his voice sang without a song"").  There's
    a sense of futility and loss to his lyrics, but these slight gaffes are made all the more noticeable by
    gracefully evocative lines like the one that ends ""A Smile That Explodes"": ""I write one more letter I won't
    send except for across the floor.""  Still, the overall meanings of this complicated album are never lost.
    These songs communicate a gnawing, almost unnamable hurt that drives Arthur not just emotionally but-- more
    crucially-- artistically.  He wants to leave behind more than just a shadow.</p></div>"|303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/303-our-shadows-will-remain/|7.8|Stephen M. Deusner

    Nick Drake.  After an album's worth of thorny sine waves and electronic sound deconstructions, Michael
    Beckett, the tech-head behind kpt, scrubbed away his steel-wool atmospheres and ended with a stark,
    nouveau-folk arrangement that left listeners scratching their heads.  It seemed a disjointed end to his
    ethereal computerized compositions.  But one listen to his latest, self-titled effort makes it obvious
    Beckett was simply introducing us to a genre on which he had further designs: pop.</p><p>
    
    Well, perhaps ""pop"" is putting too fine a sheen on it.  On <i>kpt.michi.gan</i>, Beckett pits lustrous folk
    guitar arrangements against his tastes for harsh, unsettling wirescapes.  The result is an often stunning
    but mostly perplexing effort in what one could term static-folk.  Beckett's forcible juxtaposition of
    autumnal pop songs and academic electronic composition rarely gels; instead, it dissolves into sudden
    tempo-shifts and confused atmospheric discord.</p><p>
    
    ""The Summer Session"" opens with the sounds of an electronic slaughterhouse trembling with blood-curdling
    squeals and jugular sine waves.  Just as the cacophony gets too burdensome, a gorgeous acoustic guitar loop
    sifts in out of the gore and engulfs the listener in pleasant, sylvan imagery.  The transition is too
    jarring, though, and winds up sounding like two song fragments super-glued together in the studio-- attempting
    an update of the whimsical psychedelic shifts of ""A Day in the Life"", it falls apart in a chaotic identity
    clash.</p><p>
    
    On this album, Beckett sings more often than he has in the past but still seems uneasy with his vocals.  Much
    like touring pal and occasional lap-pop co-conspirator Schneider TM, he uses a vocoder to angularize the
    soft, plush textures of his voice.  ""Hey People!"" begs us to cast off our cares and submit to feverish urban
    lusts, but his vocoded urging seems to hold us at arm's length, making his detached command ring false and
    hollow.  Like much of the album, Beckett wants to carve a line of protest in wet cement, but he's too finicky
    to use his fingers.</p><p>
    
    Every once in a while, Beckett returns to his roots, unearthing the heathen beauty in mechanized howling and
    re-claiming the compelling noise-squalls of older compositions like ""Derber Papa"".  ""Mount Michigan"" hovers
    on what sounds like a subtle bagpipe jeer before blending buzzing sine waves and revolving interference into
    a Fennesz-like ode to hard-wired misanthropy.  Circular noises hum like natural machinery as Beckett recreates
    a supermarket ambience, and, reminding us that repetition is the harmony beneath our self-neglect, the is
    coated in simple, sublime noise.</p><p>
    
    In the end, Beckett dips from the soft/harsh well far too often.  On ""Coughsong"", he wheezes into a rolling
    acoustic guitar part reminiscent of <i>Sea Change</i>-era Beck or Serge Gainsbourg.  As the drifting ease
    begins to loll you sunblind, he splits it headfirst with dirty drums and aggressive static waves.  He contorts
    both his simplistic pop urges and his more obtuse soundscaping, and makes good on neither.  Always drooling
    to have his cake and eat it too, you can't help but wish Beckett were either less the egghead or a little
    less the pop-jughead.  By now, it's hard to tell just where his strengths lie.</p></div>"|4526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4526-kptmichigan/|6.2|Derek Miller

In 1991, it was <i>Spin</i>'s album of the year, besting
    Nirvana's <i>Nevermind</i>, a release that would later be hailed by the same publication as the greatest LP
    of the 90s.  Such contradictions are a testament to the cerebral oddity that, even though stories are told
    forward, they're formed backward-- events, or works of art, that occur at a certain time can take on greater
    importance when subsequent events lend them meaning.  The then-present may have deemed <i>Bandwagonesque</i>
    just as compelling as <i>Nevermind</i>, but the future rendered Nirvana's record far more important.</p><p>
    
    This bothersome epistemological fact has led the world of academic art in the 20th century-- ever concerned
    with securing historical posterity-- to adopt a curious mindset.  Artists have had to learn to speak a language
    of continuous self-analysis, regarding themselves in historical and present contexts so as to constantly
    reaffirm and even force their relevance within such stories.  In modern art, it's been widely complained,
    the justification of a piece can be more important than its content.  The artist learns a craft, but also
    a thought process that demonstrates a constant awareness of his or her continuity with the past, importance
    in the present, and meaning for the future-- every artist is equal parts analyst, critic, and salesperson.</p><p>
    
    Brian Eno has gradually been placed-- and has placed himself-- at the beginning of a growing number of
    stories regarding contemporary music; needless to say, the man went to art school.  His historical-analytical
    mindset has angered some when it's led him to make sweeping claims such as, ""I invented ambient music.""  Of
    course, much music has both ideologically and aesthetically predated Eno's (an issue explored in Mark Pendergast's
    <i>The Ambient Century</i>).  The sense in which Eno invented ambient music is that he was able to identify its
    parts and impact, and thus hone a thesis stated through his <i>Ambient 1-4</i> series.  He took a loose collection
    of artistic impressions that were somehow related and defined their connection and import, creating-- as John
    Dewey's <i>Art as Experience</i> would've called it-- a unified, qualitative aesthetic experience.  He
    ""discovered"" ambient music in the same way that most countries have been ""discovered""-- when a Westerner
    finds it, names it, and gives it borders.  His works are breathtaking, but the polemics that accompany them
    are of equal parts accomplishment and influence.</p><p>
    
    Eno's ambient ideal was formed in 1975 during months of lying in a hospital bed recovering from a car
    accident, forced to listen to too-quiet 18th century harp music that his body cast prevented him from
    turning up.  This alerted him to the way that recorded sound can effectively merge with the environment
    in which it's played, appealing to ""many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular.""
    He aimed to create a cocoon for thought and reflection through a music that could be used with utilitarian
    purpose.  He has described the process as a painter taking the human figure out of a landscape.  In music,
    this figure took the form of his own voice, a cohesive melody, and other evidence of human intervention--
    by eliminating these, he created a sense of space where there was once an object.</p><p>
    
    Brian Eno's affinity with composer John Cage is strong, in both their shared conception of environment as
    music and use of chance operations to illustrate this effect.  The difference is that John Cage saw even
    musical basics like tonality and harmony-- the things that lend music emotional content-- as subject to
    his own theoretical rigidity, making some of his work ultimately uninviting to an average listener.  But
    Eno's ambient works subvert themselves to the standards of musical beauty even in the farthest absence of
    humanity.  Thus, in the same way that the most nihilistic of literary resolutions can somehow offer
    transcendence of meaning if the writing is beautiful, the ambient albums embody a duality of emotional
    distance and deep affection within that detachment.</p><p>
    
    As in a dream, such music has the power to make one nostalgic for places either never visited or nonexistent.
    And to many modern listeners, the melancholic nostalgia in these works has become twofold; it's both inherent
    in the music itself, and in the now-datedness of the recording style, which evokes a world of 1970s and 80s
    synthesizer music. One thinks of, for example, the soundtracks to grainy science-fiction movies such as
    Vangelis' score to <i>Blade Runner</i>, or that of <i>Dune</i> (the theme of which Eno contributed).  Eno's
    sound appeals today to the ideal worlds both of abstract perfection and to the media of our own younger lives.</p><p>
    
    The most direct outgrowth of Eno's epiphanal experience was the <i>Discreet Music</i>, released in the same
    year as his accident; indeed, he recommended that it be played over hospital speakers to create an environment
    soothing to patients (it has, in fact, become a popular piece for expecting mothers).  The 30-minute title
    track is one of the most pure realizations of Eno's original vision, a gentle immersion in slow, warm waves
    of sound. It's intended to be played at low volumes ""even to the extent that it frequently falls below the
    threshold of audibility.""  The piece is an analog version of several theories that Eno would explore fully
    through computer software in the 90s.  It's based in a sort of musical systems theory-- self-organizing works
    in a free-roaming environment of musical parameters predetermined by the composer.  Thus, the actual
    execution of the music requires ""little to no intervention"" on the musician's part.  Such systems create
    pieces that could go on forever, static in terms of musical movement yet never repeating exactly.  In this
    case, Eno hooked his synth up to a tape delay system that allowed two melodic lines to linger and evolve
    with minimal input on his behalf. The result remains one of the greatest single ambient pieces that Eno
    has produced.</p><p>
    
    The album also includes three smaller works, variations upon Johann Pachelbel's ""The Canon in D Major"" derived
    by applying chance procedures to the original score and performed by a group of musicians conducted by Gavin
    Bryars-- composer of the beautiful <i>The Sinking of the Titanic</i>.  If the piece ""Discreet Music"" is an
    aural statement of what ambient sounds like, then these are the term's ideological distillations.  By
    building swirling drones upon a staple of the classical repertoire, Eno representationally strips music of
    its functionality-- the classic tension and resolution of one chord moving toward the next.  Pachelbel's
    ""Canon"", in its circle-of-fifths progression, is a textbook piece of functional harmony; Eno's deconstruction,
    conversely, makes any expectation of musical movement impossible.  Thus, though not the most enveloping or
    appealing of Eno's works, these variations gently force the listener to switch fundamental modes of hearing.</p><p>
    
    Eno's first official statement of larger intent came three years later with <i>Ambient 1: Music for Airports</i>.
    The dispassionate title reflects the smooth, sterile, modernist surfaces that the music evokes.  Eno picked a
    building similar to a hospital, the location of ambient music's conception.  Both hospitals and airports are
    centered on mechanized rituals that are simultaneously in the service of, and often numb to, basic human needs.
    Eno thus aimed to make a music that would ""get rid of people's nervousness.""  The music comes in four sparse
    sections-- some of them solo piano, some synthesized voices and other tones, all altered through subtle tape
    manipulation.  In long, disintegrating notes that echo the work of Morton Feldman, <i>Music for Airports</i>
    gives the listener nothing to hold onto, remaining as transitory as its location.</p><p>
    
    In describing this album, Eno said, ""One of the things music can do is change your sense of time so you
    don't really mind if things slip away or alter in some way.""  In <i>Music for Airports</i>' meeting of place
    and sound, Eno realizes music's capacity to unify contrasting conceptions of time.  The imagery of airports
    implies constant movement-- passengers rushing to catch a flight, planes taking off, lines of people and
    conveyor belts moving forward.  Yet Eno's work is composed of placid, sustained tones that connote stillness.
    This contrast evokes both the inherent transcendent suspension in speed and the sense of ""rushing forward""
    within a warm drone, and it's why many have likened the emotional content of Eno's work to the barrage of
    sixteenth notes found in minimalist pieces.  Though opposite in rhythmic conceits, both seem to warp one's
    sense of movement through space.</p><p>
<i>Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror</i> (1980) is Eno's collaboration with pianist Harold Budd, a late
    bloomer of a musician who became a master of playing his instrument at barely audible volumes.  In the
    Grand Unified Story of Music, it's definitely the ambient album that most directly leads to much of the
    Windham Hill label's output-- a connection Eno would care to forget, as he's complained that new age mimics
    his aesthetic universe while divesting it of deeper meaning.  Budd's placid, Satie-like melodies on reverbed
    piano are backed by hushed tones from Eno.  <i>The Plateaux</i> matches Eno's other ambient albums in its
    moments of deep beauty, though it does little to mute the human presence.  One gets the feeling that Harold
    Budd was after something slightly different from Eno, as his playing seems a bit busy under the concept at
    hand.  Still, left on in the background, <i>Plateaux</i> is a light-filled album that accomplishes the goal
    of transforming its environment.  It can turn any room into a place of fragile reverence, and it can offer
    poignancy to the most mundane of actions.</p><p>
<i>Ambient 4: On Land</i> (1982) has been cited by both Eno and many fans as his best work.  It's a complete
    realization of several artistic aims, and of all his albums it remains the most distinctive-- there are hardly
    any successful imitators of its unique universe.  As <i>Discreet Music</i> foretold the manner by which
    Eno would realize self-contained musical environments, <i>On Land</i> presages the sound of several musical
    elements acting independently, coinciding only by chance yet remaining cohesive.  The tracks of <i>On Land</i>,
    all fairly unchanging environments in this way, seem to similarly extend infinitely past the boundaries of
    their beginnings and ends.</p><p>
    
    Eno has talked of finding his inspiration for <i>On Land</i> in Ghana, when he used a microphone and
    headphones to hear the conflated sounds of his surrounding radius.  ""The effect of this simple technological
    system was to cluster all the disparate sounds into one aural frame; they became music.""  (For a demonstration
    of this effect, just walk around outside with a microphone amplified into a pair of headphones: It really
    is striking to hear the world flattened into two dimensions upon one's ears.)  The result was an attempt
    to make dense ""worlds"" of sound using the same sense of disparate yet spatially connected elements.  The

In 1991, it was <i>Spin</i>'s album of the year, besting
    Nirvana's <i>Nevermind</i>, a release that would later be hailed by the same publication as the greatest LP
    of the 90s.  Such contradictions are a testament to the cerebral oddity that, even though stories are told
    forward, they're formed backward-- events, or works of art, that occur at a certain time can take on greater
    importance when subsequent events lend them meaning.  The then-present may have deemed <i>Bandwagonesque</i>
    just as compelling as <i>Nevermind</i>, but the future rendered Nirvana's record far more important.</p><p>
    
    This bothersome epistemological fact has led the world of academic art in the 20th century-- ever concerned
    with securing historical posterity-- to adopt a curious mindset.  Artists have had to learn to speak a language
    of continuous self-analysis, regarding themselves in historical and present contexts so as to constantly
    reaffirm and even force their relevance within such stories.  In modern art, it's been widely complained,
    the justification of a piece can be more important than its content.  The artist learns a craft, but also
    a thought process that demonstrates a constant awareness of his or her continuity with the past, importance
    in the present, and meaning for the future-- every artist is equal parts analyst, critic, and salesperson.</p><p>
    
    Brian Eno has gradually been placed-- and has placed himself-- at the beginning of a growing number of
    stories regarding contemporary music; needless to say, the man went to art school.  His historical-analytical
    mindset has angered some when it's led him to make sweeping claims such as, ""I invented ambient music.""  Of
    course, much music has both ideologically and aesthetically predated Eno's (an issue explored in Mark Pendergast's
    <i>The Ambient Century</i>).  The sense in which Eno invented ambient music is that he was able to identify its
    parts and impact, and thus hone a thesis stated through his <i>Ambient 1-4</i> series.  He took a loose collection
    of artistic impressions that were somehow related and defined their connection and import, creating-- as John
    Dewey's <i>Art as Experience</i> would've called it-- a unified, qualitative aesthetic experience.  He
    ""discovered"" ambient music in the same way that most countries have been ""discovered""-- when a Westerner
    finds it, names it, and gives it borders.  His works are breathtaking, but the polemics that accompany them
    are of equal parts accomplishment and influence.</p><p>
    
    Eno's ambient ideal was formed in 1975 during months of lying in a hospital bed recovering from a car
    accident, forced to listen to too-quiet 18th century harp music that his body cast prevented him from
    turning up.  This alerted him to the way that recorded sound can effectively merge with the environment
    in which it's played, appealing to ""many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular.""
    He aimed to create a cocoon for thought and reflection through a music that could be used with utilitarian
    purpose.  He has described the process as a painter taking the human figure out of a landscape.  In music,
    this figure took the form of his own voice, a cohesive melody, and other evidence of human intervention--
    by eliminating these, he created a sense of space where there was once an object.</p><p>
    
    Brian Eno's affinity with composer John Cage is strong, in both their shared conception of environment as
    music and use of chance operations to illustrate this effect.  The difference is that John Cage saw even
    musical basics like tonality and harmony-- the things that lend music emotional content-- as subject to
    his own theoretical rigidity, making some of his work ultimately uninviting to an average listener.  But
    Eno's ambient works subvert themselves to the standards of musical beauty even in the farthest absence of
    humanity.  Thus, in the same way that the most nihilistic of literary resolutions can somehow offer
    transcendence of meaning if the writing is beautiful, the ambient albums embody a duality of emotional
    distance and deep affection within that detachment.</p><p>
    
    As in a dream, such music has the power to make one nostalgic for places either never visited or nonexistent.
    And to many modern listeners, the melancholic nostalgia in these works has become twofold; it's both inherent
    in the music itself, and in the now-datedness of the recording style, which evokes a world of 1970s and 80s
    synthesizer music. One thinks of, for example, the soundtracks to grainy science-fiction movies such as
    Vangelis' score to <i>Blade Runner</i>, or that of <i>Dune</i> (the theme of which Eno contributed).  Eno's
    sound appeals today to the ideal worlds both of abstract perfection and to the media of our own younger lives.</p><p>
    
    The most direct outgrowth of Eno's epiphanal experience was the <i>Discreet Music</i>, released in the same
    year as his accident; indeed, he recommended that it be played over hospital speakers to create an environment
    soothing to patients (it has, in fact, become a popular piece for expecting mothers).  The 30-minute title
    track is one of the most pure realizations of Eno's original vision, a gentle immersion in slow, warm waves
    of sound. It's intended to be played at low volumes ""even to the extent that it frequently falls below the
    threshold of audibility.""  The piece is an analog version of several theories that Eno would explore fully
    through computer software in the 90s.  It's based in a sort of musical systems theory-- self-organizing works
    in a free-roaming environment of musical parameters predetermined by the composer.  Thus, the actual
    execution of the music requires ""little to no intervention"" on the musician's part.  Such systems create
    pieces that could go on forever, static in terms of musical movement yet never repeating exactly.  In this
    case, Eno hooked his synth up to a tape delay system that allowed two melodic lines to linger and evolve
    with minimal input on his behalf. The result remains one of the greatest single ambient pieces that Eno
    has produced.</p><p>
    
    The album also includes three smaller works, variations upon Johann Pachelbel's ""The Canon in D Major"" derived
    by applying chance procedures to the original score and performed by a group of musicians conducted by Gavin
    Bryars-- composer of the beautiful <i>The Sinking of the Titanic</i>.  If the piece ""Discreet Music"" is an
    aural statement of what ambient sounds like, then these are the term's ideological distillations.  By
    building swirling drones upon a staple of the classical repertoire, Eno representationally strips music of
    its functionality-- the classic tension and resolution of one chord moving toward the next.  Pachelbel's
    ""Canon"", in its circle-of-fifths progression, is a textbook piece of functional harmony; Eno's deconstruction,
    conversely, makes any expectation of musical movement impossible.  Thus, though not the most enveloping or
    appealing of Eno's works, these variations gently force the listener to switch fundamental modes of hearing.</p><p>
    
    Eno's first official statement of larger intent came three years later with <i>Ambient 1: Music for Airports</i>.
    The dispassionate title reflects the smooth, sterile, modernist surfaces that the music evokes.  Eno picked a
    building similar to a hospital, the location of ambient music's conception.  Both hospitals and airports are
    centered on mechanized rituals that are simultaneously in the service of, and often numb to, basic human needs.
    Eno thus aimed to make a music that would ""get rid of people's nervousness.""  The music comes in four sparse
    sections-- some of them solo piano, some synthesized voices and other tones, all altered through subtle tape
    manipulation.  In long, disintegrating notes that echo the work of Morton Feldman, <i>Music for Airports</i>
    gives the listener nothing to hold onto, remaining as transitory as its location.</p><p>
    
    In describing this album, Eno said, ""One of the things music can do is change your sense of time so you
    don't really mind if things slip away or alter in some way.""  In <i>Music for Airports</i>' meeting of place
    and sound, Eno realizes music's capacity to unify contrasting conceptions of time.  The imagery of airports
    implies constant movement-- passengers rushing to catch a flight, planes taking off, lines of people and
    conveyor belts moving forward.  Yet Eno's work is composed of placid, sustained tones that connote stillness.
    This contrast evokes both the inherent transcendent suspension in speed and the sense of ""rushing forward""
    within a warm drone, and it's why many have likened the emotional content of Eno's work to the barrage of
    sixteenth notes found in minimalist pieces.  Though opposite in rhythmic conceits, both seem to warp one's
    sense of movement through space.</p><p>
<i>Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror</i> (1980) is Eno's collaboration with pianist Harold Budd, a late
    bloomer of a musician who became a master of playing his instrument at barely audible volumes.  In the
    Grand Unified Story of Music, it's definitely the ambient album that most directly leads to much of the
    Windham Hill label's output-- a connection Eno would care to forget, as he's complained that new age mimics
    his aesthetic universe while divesting it of deeper meaning.  Budd's placid, Satie-like melodies on reverbed
    piano are backed by hushed tones from Eno.  <i>The Plateaux</i> matches Eno's other ambient albums in its
    moments of deep beauty, though it does little to mute the human presence.  One gets the feeling that Harold
    Budd was after something slightly different from Eno, as his playing seems a bit busy under the concept at
    hand.  Still, left on in the background, <i>Plateaux</i> is a light-filled album that accomplishes the goal
    of transforming its environment.  It can turn any room into a place of fragile reverence, and it can offer
    poignancy to the most mundane of actions.</p><p>
<i>Ambient 4: On Land</i> (1982) has been cited by both Eno and many fans as his best work.  It's a complete
    realization of several artistic aims, and of all his albums it remains the most distinctive-- there are hardly
    any successful imitators of its unique universe.  As <i>Discreet Music</i> foretold the manner by which
    Eno would realize self-contained musical environments, <i>On Land</i> presages the sound of several musical
    elements acting independently, coinciding only by chance yet remaining cohesive.  The tracks of <i>On Land</i>,
    all fairly unchanging environments in this way, seem to similarly extend infinitely past the boundaries of
    their beginnings and ends.</p><p>
    
    Eno has talked of finding his inspiration for <i>On Land</i> in Ghana, when he used a microphone and
    headphones to hear the conflated sounds of his surrounding radius.  ""The effect of this simple technological
    system was to cluster all the disparate sounds into one aural frame; they became music.""  (For a demonstration
    of this effect, just walk around outside with a microphone amplified into a pair of headphones: It really
    is striking to hear the world flattened into two dimensions upon one's ears.)  The result was an attempt
    to make dense ""worlds"" of sound using the same sense of disparate yet spatially connected elements.  The
    album is both more varied than his other ambient works and more foreboding.  The atmospheres in many of
    <i>On Land</i>'s pieces are so dense as to leave one staring down a chasm of sound, with no visible bottom
    apparent.  Eno used several nonmusical objects and field recordings to contribute to <i>On Land</i>'s thick

    Nirvana's <i>Nevermind</i>, a release that would later be hailed by the same publication as the greatest LP
    of the 90s.  Such contradictions are a testament to the cerebral oddity that, even though stories are told
    forward, they're formed backward-- events, or works of art, that occur at a certain time can take on greater
    importance when subsequent events lend them meaning.  The then-present may have deemed <i>Bandwagonesque</i>
    just as compelling as <i>Nevermind</i>, but the future rendered Nirvana's record far more important.</p><p>
    
    This bothersome epistemological fact has led the world of academic art in the 20th century-- ever concerned
    with securing historical posterity-- to adopt a curious mindset.  Artists have had to learn to speak a language
    of continuous self-analysis, regarding themselves in historical and present contexts so as to constantly
    reaffirm and even force their relevance within such stories.  In modern art, it's been widely complained,
    the justification of a piece can be more important than its content.  The artist learns a craft, but also
    a thought process that demonstrates a constant awareness of his or her continuity with the past, importance
    in the present, and meaning for the future-- every artist is equal parts analyst, critic, and salesperson.</p><p>
    
    Brian Eno has gradually been placed-- and has placed himself-- at the beginning of a growing number of
    stories regarding contemporary music; needless to say, the man went to art school.  His historical-analytical
    mindset has angered some when it's led him to make sweeping claims such as, ""I invented ambient music.""  Of
    course, much music has both ideologically and aesthetically predated Eno's (an issue explored in Mark Pendergast's
    <i>The Ambient Century</i>).  The sense in which Eno invented ambient music is that he was able to identify its
    parts and impact, and thus hone a thesis stated through his <i>Ambient 1-4</i> series.  He took a loose collection
    of artistic impressions that were somehow related and defined their connection and import, creating-- as John
    Dewey's <i>Art as Experience</i> would've called it-- a unified, qualitative aesthetic experience.  He
    ""discovered"" ambient music in the same way that most countries have been ""discovered""-- when a Westerner
    finds it, names it, and gives it borders.  His works are breathtaking, but the polemics that accompany them
    are of equal parts accomplishment and influence.</p><p>
    
    Eno's ambient ideal was formed in 1975 during months of lying in a hospital bed recovering from a car
    accident, forced to listen to too-quiet 18th century harp music that his body cast prevented him from
    turning up.  This alerted him to the way that recorded sound can effectively merge with the environment
    in which it's played, appealing to ""many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular.""
    He aimed to create a cocoon for thought and reflection through a music that could be used with utilitarian
    purpose.  He has described the process as a painter taking the human figure out of a landscape.  In music,
    this figure took the form of his own voice, a cohesive melody, and other evidence of human intervention--
    by eliminating these, he created a sense of space where there was once an object.</p><p>
    
    Brian Eno's affinity with composer John Cage is strong, in both their shared conception of environment as
    music and use of chance operations to illustrate this effect.  The difference is that John Cage saw even
    musical basics like tonality and harmony-- the things that lend music emotional content-- as subject to
    his own theoretical rigidity, making some of his work ultimately uninviting to an average listener.  But
    Eno's ambient works subvert themselves to the standards of musical beauty even in the farthest absence of
    humanity.  Thus, in the same way that the most nihilistic of literary resolutions can somehow offer
    transcendence of meaning if the writing is beautiful, the ambient albums embody a duality of emotional
    distance and deep affection within that detachment.</p><p>
    
    As in a dream, such music has the power to make one nostalgic for places either never visited or nonexistent.
    And to many modern listeners, the melancholic nostalgia in these works has become twofold; it's both inherent
    in the music itself, and in the now-datedness of the recording style, which evokes a world of 1970s and 80s
    synthesizer music. One thinks of, for example, the soundtracks to grainy science-fiction movies such as
    Vangelis' score to <i>Blade Runner</i>, or that of <i>Dune</i> (the theme of which Eno contributed).  Eno's
    sound appeals today to the ideal worlds both of abstract perfection and to the media of our own younger lives.</p><p>
    
    The most direct outgrowth of Eno's epiphanal experience was the <i>Discreet Music</i>, released in the same
    year as his accident; indeed, he recommended that it be played over hospital speakers to create an environment
    soothing to patients (it has, in fact, become a popular piece for expecting mothers).  The 30-minute title
    track is one of the most pure realizations of Eno's original vision, a gentle immersion in slow, warm waves
    of sound. It's intended to be played at low volumes ""even to the extent that it frequently falls below the
    threshold of audibility.""  The piece is an analog version of several theories that Eno would explore fully
    through computer software in the 90s.  It's based in a sort of musical systems theory-- self-organizing works
    in a free-roaming environment of musical parameters predetermined by the composer.  Thus, the actual
    execution of the music requires ""little to no intervention"" on the musician's part.  Such systems create
    pieces that could go on forever, static in terms of musical movement yet never repeating exactly.  In this
    case, Eno hooked his synth up to a tape delay system that allowed two melodic lines to linger and evolve
    with minimal input on his behalf. The result remains one of the greatest single ambient pieces that Eno
    has produced.</p><p>
    
    The album also includes three smaller works, variations upon Johann Pachelbel's ""The Canon in D Major"" derived
    by applying chance procedures to the original score and performed by a group of musicians conducted by Gavin
    Bryars-- composer of the beautiful <i>The Sinking of the Titanic</i>.  If the piece ""Discreet Music"" is an
    aural statement of what ambient sounds like, then these are the term's ideological distillations.  By
    building swirling drones upon a staple of the classical repertoire, Eno representationally strips music of
    its functionality-- the classic tension and resolution of one chord moving toward the next.  Pachelbel's
    ""Canon"", in its circle-of-fifths progression, is a textbook piece of functional harmony; Eno's deconstruction,
    conversely, makes any expectation of musical movement impossible.  Thus, though not the most enveloping or
    appealing of Eno's works, these variations gently force the listener to switch fundamental modes of hearing.</p><p>
    
    Eno's first official statement of larger intent came three years later with <i>Ambient 1: Music for Airports</i>.
    The dispassionate title reflects the smooth, sterile, modernist surfaces that the music evokes.  Eno picked a
    building similar to a hospital, the location of ambient music's conception.  Both hospitals and airports are
    centered on mechanized rituals that are simultaneously in the service of, and often numb to, basic human needs.
    Eno thus aimed to make a music that would ""get rid of people's nervousness.""  The music comes in four sparse
    sections-- some of them solo piano, some synthesized voices and other tones, all altered through subtle tape
    manipulation.  In long, disintegrating notes that echo the work of Morton Feldman, <i>Music for Airports</i>
    gives the listener nothing to hold onto, remaining as transitory as its location.</p><p>
    
    In describing this album, Eno said, ""One of the things music can do is change your sense of time so you
    don't really mind if things slip away or alter in some way.""  In <i>Music for Airports</i>' meeting of place
    and sound, Eno realizes music's capacity to unify contrasting conceptions of time.  The imagery of airports
    implies constant movement-- passengers rushing to catch a flight, planes taking off, lines of people and
    conveyor belts moving forward.  Yet Eno's work is composed of placid, sustained tones that connote stillness.
    This contrast evokes both the inherent transcendent suspension in speed and the sense of ""rushing forward""
    within a warm drone, and it's why many have likened the emotional content of Eno's work to the barrage of
    sixteenth notes found in minimalist pieces.  Though opposite in rhythmic conceits, both seem to warp one's
    sense of movement through space.</p><p>
<i>Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror</i> (1980) is Eno's collaboration with pianist Harold Budd, a late
    bloomer of a musician who became a master of playing his instrument at barely audible volumes.  In the
    Grand Unified Story of Music, it's definitely the ambient album that most directly leads to much of the
    Windham Hill label's output-- a connection Eno would care to forget, as he's complained that new age mimics
    his aesthetic universe while divesting it of deeper meaning.  Budd's placid, Satie-like melodies on reverbed
    piano are backed by hushed tones from Eno.  <i>The Plateaux</i> matches Eno's other ambient albums in its
    moments of deep beauty, though it does little to mute the human presence.  One gets the feeling that Harold
    Budd was after something slightly different from Eno, as his playing seems a bit busy under the concept at
    hand.  Still, left on in the background, <i>Plateaux</i> is a light-filled album that accomplishes the goal
    of transforming its environment.  It can turn any room into a place of fragile reverence, and it can offer
    poignancy to the most mundane of actions.</p><p>
<i>Ambient 4: On Land</i> (1982) has been cited by both Eno and many fans as his best work.  It's a complete
    realization of several artistic aims, and of all his albums it remains the most distinctive-- there are hardly
    any successful imitators of its unique universe.  As <i>Discreet Music</i> foretold the manner by which
    Eno would realize self-contained musical environments, <i>On Land</i> presages the sound of several musical
    elements acting independently, coinciding only by chance yet remaining cohesive.  The tracks of <i>On Land</i>,
    all fairly unchanging environments in this way, seem to similarly extend infinitely past the boundaries of
    their beginnings and ends.</p><p>
    
    Eno has talked of finding his inspiration for <i>On Land</i> in Ghana, when he used a microphone and
    headphones to hear the conflated sounds of his surrounding radius.  ""The effect of this simple technological
    system was to cluster all the disparate sounds into one aural frame; they became music.""  (For a demonstration
    of this effect, just walk around outside with a microphone amplified into a pair of headphones: It really
    is striking to hear the world flattened into two dimensions upon one's ears.)  The result was an attempt
    to make dense ""worlds"" of sound using the same sense of disparate yet spatially connected elements.  The
    album is both more varied than his other ambient works and more foreboding.  The atmospheres in many of
    <i>On Land</i>'s pieces are so dense as to leave one staring down a chasm of sound, with no visible bottom
    apparent.  Eno used several nonmusical objects and field recordings to contribute to <i>On Land</i>'s thick
    aural web, the album being a testament to Eno's use of the studio as an instrument.  <i>On Land</i>
    intensifies the most subtle and indescribable of emotions, and it stands at the forefront of the transformative
    possibilities inherent in non-rhythmic, non-melodic music.</p><p>
    
    Brian Eno's ambient works received criticism similar to minimalist music of the time.  About Steve Reich, a
    critic once sniped that listening to his pieces was like watching waves roll upon the shore-- pretty but
    meaningless.  About Eno, guitarist Lydia Lunch once complained that all ambient did was ""flow and weave,""
    that its emotional ambiguity was oppressive and vapid.  Both criticisms assumed a certain way of perceiving
    sound to be the only valid conceits under which to compose.  But as time progresses, we find more and more
    artists influenced by Eno's expansion of sonic possibility, rendering earlier criticisms inherently moot.
    Some may find Eno's constant analysis aggrandizing, but it's that very mode of thought that allowed him to
    identify ""ambient"" as a coherent idea in the first place.  He both verbalized and demonstrated a concept
    that perfectly fit its time and place, and that has visibly shifted the landscape of musical thought.  For
    that, Eno gets to join the ranks of those who have accomplished such sea changes throughout history-- a
    shift in thought we often attribute to ""genius.""</p></div>"|11731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/|9.7|Liam Singer

    favor of musical contrarianism.  When N.W.A. and West Coast gangster nihilism hit the charts, the trio
    battled E and Cube's thuggery with flowers and hi-top fades.  When Bad Boy had a chokehold on the industry,
    De La Soul countered with their <i>Stakes Is High</i> manifesto.  Now, with bear-knit sweaters and white
    tees on fire-- and after Tommy Boy dropped the trio's Spitkickin' asses for lacking a thirst for commercialism--
    Posdnuos, Trugoy, and Maceo explore <i>The Grind Date</i>.</p><p>
    
    After 15 years, many observers wondered when their DiMaggio-like fresh streak would die.  The triumvirate
    averages three years between albums-- stemming and refitting their dark horse costumes is hardly an overnight
    project-- but the results are frequently worth the wait, and <i>The Grind Date</i> is the group's best payoff
    in ages.</p><p>
    
    Let's be honest: Anything Matthew Knowles (responsible for his booty-hopping progeny Beyonce and owner of De
    La's new home Sanctuary Union) touches, is vinyl dynamite.  Moreover, any album that kicks off with Jermaine
    Jackson's handiwork has genius written all over it.  But frequent De La collaborator Supa Dave West's opening
    volley only serves as the jumpoff for a producer home run derby, and De La Soul wisely allow their all-county
    beatmaking team (Madlib, 9th Wonder, Jay Dee, and the aforementioned Supa Dave, among others) to craft a
    vehicle on which the trio can again revamp their style.</p><p>
    
    The third installment of the <i>Art Official Intelligence</i> series was envisioned as a DJ album before
    Tommy Boy canned it.  <i>The Grind Date</i> inherits that project's propensity for organic production, as
    De La often wisely let the beats steep.  On ""Verbal Clap"", Jay Dee pushes a sparse, apocalyptic swirl that
    lacks his trademark sound but buzzes with intensity.  The ghostly keys and muted snare so effectively
    captivate the listener that Pos, Maceo, and Dave are willingly obscured.  Even Ghostface displays a moment
    of weakness when he struggles to match the triumphant brass on Supa Dave West's ""He Comes"" (although Tony
    Sparks does manage to reclaim his stature with shoutouts to Uday and Qusay).</p><p>
    
    Of course, De La delivers their lyrical goods via FreshDirect with the comfort and ease of well-seasoned
    veterans.  The title track serves as the album's centerpiece as Pos and Dave command the mic with authority
    and finesse.  Dave spits, ""Meat grind, street grind, whatever the beast/ I'ma take it at the horns til the
    pinky toe calls.""  Pos and Maceo's flexibility is uncanny as they retrofit their cadences to swing tracks
    into coalescence.  Madlib's disjointed vibes and tinkling glass on ""Shopping Bags"" blend seamlessly with
    Pos' stuttering memo re: the perils of gold-diggers: ""She say jump/ You scream, 'Okay, I'm reloaded!'/ Nigga,
    you shooting blanks.""  They even manage to draw the otherwise irrelevant Carl Thomas into the den of smoothness.</p><p>
    
    As Yummy croons ""I never can say goodbye"" on ""No"", De La Soul echoes the sentiment.  <i>The Grind Date</i>
    brings together an unimaginable team of the underground's hottest producers and meshes their idiosyncrasies
    without dissidence.  But more importantly, if this turns out to be the trio's final record, they'll have
    gone out proud, with unshakeable confidence and determination.</p></div>"|2208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2208-the-grind-date/|8.2|Jamin Warren

    The man is nearly immutable.  With the exception of his forays into folk-rock (<em>Since</em> and <em>Impasse</em>),
    Buckner's evolution has been judicious and purposeful.  His debut, the 1994 classic <em>Bloomed</em>, was a
    palimpsest of ornate gray graphite sketches, and on subsequent albums he's put his collar up against the
    wind and trudged deeper into the chilly, murky recesses of his aesthetic.  Since that first album, Buckner
    has created increasingly more ephemeral, impressionistic gradations of tone and mood.  <em>Dents and Shells</em>
    continues to explore Buckner's shadowy continent of song, a Symbolist mirror-world where bright glints of
    detail fleetingly flash, then submerge, cloaked in shifting fogs.</p><p>
<i>Dents and Shells</i> is Buckner in top form, using a broad brush to manifest his enigmatic poetics,
    hallucinatory atmospheres, and melodies that appear and evaporate like breath exhaled onto cold glass.
    The vanishing drone and epic percussive sweep (provided by ex-Butthole Surfer King Coffey) of ""Charmers"",
    and the hushed, ramshackle clatter of ""As the Waves Will Always Roll"" ably demonstrate this singer-as-condensation
    sensibility.</p><p>
    
    While strongly rooted in classic folk, Buckner's songs are rendered pristinely strange by their smallness
    and smeariness-- they're vast, dim topographies described by chords that are barely there, recondite realms
    of visions and visitations.  Buckner is the disembodied Eye roving freely within impossible spaces, cataloging
    impressionistic signatures through a hazy lens.  But it's not all simmer and seethe: Buckner's more ponderous
    tunes are leavened with lovely pop ballads like ""Her"", a sturdy platform of guitar decorated with a twinkling,
    frugal piano from which he calls out ""to nothing, in the wake of watching her sipping wine from a camping
    cup on some missing night.""</p><p>
    
    Superficially, <em>Dents and Shells</em> trods the well-worn folk paths of heartache and loss, but its lingering
    impression is more aligned with the elegant and darkly compelling logic of math.  Most shapes found in nature
    have mathematical counterparts, and the shifting, complex patterns of Buckner's lyrics and guitar work peel
    back the surfaces to reveal the numbers underpinning everything.  In this sub-world, the sky is a grid, the
    stars are vertices, the horizon of a distant shore is an x-axis, and the shells dotting it are the spiraling
    integers of the Fibonacci Sequence.  On ""A Chance Counsel""-- a classically Buckner confection of gleaming
    chords and drawled warbling-- he sings: ""Let's hear the outline,"" and later, ""listen at a number on the door.""
    To hear the outlines, the fraught spaces between tangible objects or discernible thoughts, is what Buckner
    teaches us to do. By listening at the numbers, he upturns the precise shells of logic and reveals dents in
    the sand that contain the mysteries skirting the outlines of natural law. </p><p>
    
    By now, Buckner is so far inside his vision that one fails to really <em>see</em> him-- the man sinks beneath
    all the swirling phantoms, the inscrutable blocks of coded image, and the eddying currents of blurry atmosphere
    he's summoned up around him.  By the same token, one wonders if he can see out anymore.  His increasingly
    esoteric songs suggest that the musical cocoon he's been spinning around himself for a decade deflects his
    sight inward again and again.  Regardless, it's this very sense of hermetic isolation-- and of a person's
    consciousness not creating music, but actually <em>becoming</em> it-- that makes each Buckner album feel
    like a fresh adventure in a recurring dream: No matter how well you know the landscape, its topography
    remains amorphous and impossible to chart. </p></div>"|1000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1000-dents-and-shells/|8.0|Brian Howe

    from perfecting the balance in their amalgam of surf, country and garage-rock.  Even with the subsequent
    addition of bluegrass and old trucker songs to their mix, I can still say with some certainty that I was
    right-- they've managed to find that perfect balance.  Nothing on <i>Favourite Colours</i> sounds like a
    detour.  The resulting mishmash is served nicely by the ever-broadening term ""Americana,"" though the band
    are actually Canadian (those u's in the title aren't there for nothing) and the record's most prominent
    guest is mad Englishman Robyn Hitchcock, who appears on closer ""Why Would Anybody Live Here?"".</p><p>
    
    But while the album is stylistically and sonically brilliant, it still suffers from the primary flaw of the
    band's four previous albums: Their songwriting hasn't made the same leap as their chops.  There are a few
    standout melodies, but most of them are too limited in range to be truly memorable.  The band's vocals can
    recall a sort of fantasy collaboration between Kris Kristofferson and <i>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</i>-era
    Byrds without exactly nailing what made either great, but they're still apropos for their easy-loping
    country-surf beat.  On <i>Favourite Colours</i>, the band members handle the production themselves for the
    first time, and they give those close harmonies a roomy atmosphere, with pedal steels echoing in the
    distance, drums that impart the sound of the room in which they were recorded, and guitars that jangle
    and twang in equal measure.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with the surf-bluegrass rush of ""Northumberland West"", a two-minute instrumental stuffed
    with more rapid-fire Ozark guitar licks than an entire mid-80s Mekons album.  ""Translucent Sparrow"" is
    spiked with nasty fuzz guitar and a lugubrious, almost <i>Atom Heart Mother</i>-ish horn section, while
    ""Song of the Chief Musician (Part 2)"" is gentle country jangle in an ocean of reverb.  ""Song of the Chief
    Musician"" is one of three tracks curiously given the ""Part"" distinction, though none of them share a title
    or much of anything else in common.  Those three songs are the album's strongest moments, and as such they
    form a sort of backbone for the record.  ""1000 Cities Falling (Part 1)"" is an arresting ballad led by
    fingerpicked guitars and spacey steel interjections, while ""Why Be So Curious? (Part 3)"" reflects back on
    the rhythmic feel of ""Northumberland West"" and offers one of the album's best vocal melodies.</p><p>
    
    The beautifully placid instrumental ""The Iceberg"" and lilting acoustic two-step of ""A Good Flying Day""
    nicely round out the album's midsection, but it's difficult to remember much of what comes between those
    songs and the album's end.  ""As Much as Such"" strains to work its melody into its surroundings and feels
    painfully forced, while ""Only You and Your Eyes""-- which could have blossomed into a classic surf ballad--
    fails to develop beyond its first few bars.  Even Hitchcock's guest spot comes up short in the melody
    department, sounding like a castoff from an unsuccessful Egyptians session.</p><p>
    
    It's a shame that the album loses momentum in its final third, because <i>Favourite Colours</i> is otherwise
    The Sadies' most fully realized statement to date.  They may yet make the album they've always threatened to
    craft, but for now The Sadies still remain a band of seemingly great potential and slightly disappointing
    results.</p></div>"|6964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6964-favourite-colours/|7.2|Joe Tangari

Her work with The Moldy Peaches has always been
    indebted to K cornerstone Beat Happening, and the withdrawn folk of her three previous solo albums would
    fit snugly beside the twee that has long clogged that label's roster.  But Dawson has always channeled the
    confrontational energy of her work with Adam Green into her otherwise innocuous solo material, and tempers
    her wide-eyed sincerity with a deeply sardonic sensibility.  The success of her music is blocked by two
    equally formidable limitations: Her rudimentary guitar arrangements and hoarse, adolescent voice are at
    high risk of producing cloying results, and the remnants of affected hostility from her Moldy Peaches days
    add yet another potential layer of unpleasantness.</p><p>
    
    Her work has been compelling when her balance between cynical disaffection and childish naivete is in
    constant flux.  Her 2002 debut <i>I'm Sorry That Sometimes I'm Mean</i> sounds like a journal entry from
    the bedroom of a Gen-Xer in arrested development, infusing a cynical post-adolescent assessment of the
    world at large with the comforting Casiotones and music box chimes of childhood.  The sonic construction
    of <i>Hidden Vagenda</i> reveals a discernible maturation-- Dawson's arrangements here are her most complex
    to date, adding a diverse collection of instrumentalists and vocalists to her typically bare-bones production.
    Lyrically, however, Dawson seems trapped in the narrow confines of her conceptual focus. <i>Hidden Vagenda</i>
    attempts to disguise itself as a concept album of sorts, using the current American political landscape as an
    imprecise template for foreboding tales of death, capitalist opportunism, and the destruction of family and
    community, all told through the filter of juvenilia artifice.</p><p>
    
    Dawson's choice to directly engage current events is a gamble that ultimately fails.  Her simple musical
    approach works well to illustrate broad concepts, such as the child-like rumination on death in ""It's Been
    Raining"", but falls flat in the face of events whose magnitude overshadow casual introspection.  It's
    difficult to empathize with Dawson's response to the 9/11 attacks in ""Anthrax (Power Ballad Version)"" (""We
    turned on CNN/ Watched the towers fall again/ And realized our lives weren't so bad"") when her tone is so
    ambivalent.  Her political commentary consistently falls flat: Her token laundry list of Bush-era grievances
    in ""Viva La Persistence"" encompasses everything from colonial imperialism to Vanilla Coke, but her intentional
    lack of mature insight-- a natural result of her conceptual approach-- quickly becomes exasperating, particularly
    in the song's most juvenile moments (""Would I choose deep-fried apathy/ McNuggets where my balls should be/
    Or supersized conformity?"").</p><p>
    
    However, most of the album avoids awkward political sentiment, and many of these tracks stand out musically
    as Dawson's strongest material.  The disconcerting group sing-along ""I Will Never Forget"" employs tympani,
    strings, and music box ornamentation to add a newfound richness to her tortured recollections of childhood.
    The silly bicycle bells and oompah horn section of ""Parade"" complement the song's surreal urban imagery,
    and languid alt-country closer ""Angels and Seagulls"" is sarcastic but strangely calming; Dawson delights
    in the prospect of solitude that drowning might provide.</p><p>
    
    Though the jump to a new label has allowed Dawson a fuller and more rewarding production style, she is
    still far from perfecting a persona that, in all likelihood, will always seem somewhat disingenuous.
    <i>Hidden Vagenda</i> is elegantly constructed and outwardly naive, but it lacks a consistent underlying
    honesty.  Despite her evocation of youth, Dawson still frequently comes across as jaded, and the conflict
    that arises from this clash-- though intermittently compelling-- deprives <i>Hidden Vagenda</i> of the
    sincerity the material deserves.</p></div>"|2579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2579-hidden-vagenda/|6.5|David Moore

In between delivering prominent major-label efforts at a
    roughly biennial clip, the band have got their kicks in lower-profile fringe collaborations-- most notably
    their millennium-capping <i>Goodbye 20th Century</i>, which saw them interpreting the works of a host of
    seminal experimental composers. It's a dubious double life that draws divisive lines-- perhaps unintentionally--
    between fan and fanatic, grazer and junkie.</p><p>
    
    Still, it takes a strong stomach to digest some of these asides-- even for diehards.  The band hit its
    experimental apex (or nadir) in 2000 when they released the cavorting, bohemia-smitten <i>NYC Ghosts &amp;
    Flowers</i>.  The album was met with overwhelming disapprobation and, on their subsequent major-label
    efforts, SY have retreated into markedly subdued territory, producing a pair of albums-- <i>Murray Street</i>
    and <i>Sonic Nurse</i>-- that thrive on traditional song structures.</p><p>
    
    While the results of their avant-garde endeavors have not always been successful, they've all but vouchsafed
    Sonic Youth's legacy as a band unafraid to take risks and abruptly change direction when needed.  That said,
    <i>Hidros 3 (To Patti Smith)</i> is probably not the record many of their devotees were hoping for.  Instead,
    it's perhaps what hardened SY fans have come to expect: Something unlike anything the band have done before,
    and no friendlier for it.</p><p>
    
    Mats Gustafsson is a well-established reed player and improviser.  He's also the incidental progenitor of
    the fluteophone (simply a flute played with a saxophone mouthpiece).  Gustafsson made his mark as a virtuoso,
    but the Sweden native recently chiseled himself a niche as an upstart avant-jazz composer with his diverse
    and often challenging <i>Hidros</i> series.  The sequence's third installment was performed live by Sonic
    Youth, guitarist Loren Connors, and a slew of accompanying musicians at an October 2000 concert, and is
    perhaps the young composer's boldest statement to date.</p><p>
    
    Stylistically, the performance harkens back to Sonic Youth's noisome early days as rogue freelancers in
    no-wave icon Glenn Branca's guitar-based orchestras.  <i>Hidros 3</i> isn't shy about its unfettered
    experimentalism, stridently eschewing all semblance of time and structure.  The work is more of a textural
    tone poem-- and a rather heavy-handed one at that-- spending most of its time in a noisy netherworld of
    guitars, electronics, and occasional contrabass saxophone.  Its rare quiet moments offer respite and a
    chance to collect oneself from the jarring high-volume passages, but are often marred by Kim Gordon's
    equally strident vocals.</p><p>
    
    Gordon plays a marginal but important role, sporadically delivering anemic beat-style diatribes that serve
    as a comparably abrasive accompaniment to the shrill guitar fronts.  It would have been nice if she were
    used in a more contrary fashion, perhaps as a more congenial melodic counterweight to the anarchic
    instrumentals a la John Cage's use of pitch-perfect opera singing against a backdrop of found sound in
    his <i>Aria with Fontana Mix</i>.  But as such, Gordon ruptures the peace one might hope to find within
    these helter-skelter miasmas.</p><p>
    
    Even without Gordon, the terrain is rough going.  The first of two installments of ""Processed Voice"" is a
    12-minute slog through marshes of caterwauling electronics and stuttering guitars.  After six minutes of
    utter chaos, a brief and unintelligible vocal loop is incorporated, providing the movement's only source
    of rhythmic consistency.  Elsewhere, melodic clarity is equally scarce: A fleeting solo at around the 5:30
    mark of the second ""Processed Voice"" is as close as this collection comes to delivering a discernible hook.</p><p>
    
    In <i>Hidros 3</i>, nothing is sacred.  These rugged compositions are uniformly loud, shapeless, and often
    protracted to extreme lengths.  There's little ambiguity about the adroitness of the guitarists' noise
    making, and their deft improvising takes the album in sundry directions.  This transience and variety
    should help revive some listeners after the album's particularly dense sections.  But because of <i>Hidros</i>'
    largely improvised nature, it's difficult to judge Gustafsson's composition objectively.  The recording is
    frustratingly irresolute and demands a great deal of input from its performers.  Of course, Gustafsson
    couldn't have done better than enlisting one of the most innovative and established guitar bands of the
    past 20 years.  But in doing so, he vested his creative power in non-control, making for a vital document
    of Sonic Youth's most outre period and an adventurous, if indeterminate, mark on his own burgeoning resume.</p></div>"|3653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3653-hidros-3-to-patti-smith/|6.9|Sam Ubl

Vis-a-vis Karate's mixture
    of emo, jazz, and post-rock (a libation they've blended much more palatably than like-minded contemporaries
    Joan of Arc), one feels compelled to state that there are two kinds of artists in the world.  The first are
    those who doggedly pursue their aesthetic agenda through a single lens-- like, say, essayist David Sedaris,
    who's written approximately one million belles-lettres about how hard (yet funny) it was to grow up gay in
    the South-- and the second are those who filter their unique sensibility through various lenses, like Karate
    bandleader Geoff Farina.</p><p>
    
    Karate's music is likely energized by Farina's multifarious other projects: He's released three solo albums,
    played with indie pop act Secret Stars, and co-founded an artists' colony in Rhode Island.  He writes about
    gear for <em>Tape Op</em> magazine, and has composed scores for films by Genet, Beckett, and Man Ray at the
    behest of the Italian film festival Cinemazero.  This sort of artistic dilettantism helps to prevent any
    single endeavor from becoming stagnant-- one imagines the butcher who keeps all of his knives sharp by not
    overusing any single one.</p><p>
    
    Even within Karate, Farina hasn't idled.  Their initially unremarkable emo reached a turning point with 2000's
    <em>Unsolved</em>, which began a sequence of albums that arrayed vast guitarscapes around the technical elements
    of jazz and the abstruse theory of post-rock.  It's a career-defining album that's at once accessible and
    distinctive-- a unified artistic statement that realizes their full potential. </p><p>
    
    On <em>Pockets</em>, Karate shed their post-rock trappings entirely, sublimating emo and jazz beneath a
    patina of polished, intuitive 70s pop-rock.  These concise songs feel effortless in a way that belies their
    understated technical proficiency, and are so seamlessly sequenced that the mood-- breezy and jazzy, yet
    dark and deliberately unfolding-- is airtight.  Farina metes out sharp, oblique narratives that in his
    resonant and ascetically emotive voice, and <em>Pockets</em> attains the confluence of instinctive aural
    appeal, hard-won technical ability, and refined vision of which year-end lists are made. </p><p>
    
    A record of such stark beauty and discreet drama could only open with a flourish, and the first quavering
    chord of ""With Age"" is a gloved hand drawing back a velvet curtain.  It establishes a formula that flexes
    through many permutations of mood and color over the remainder of the album: Clean, bright guitars that
    swing at a peppy mid-tempo or ponderously bend and stress; melodic, fleet basslines; a wash of supple
    percussion; and fluid dynamic shifts interleaved with cadenced, organic guitar solos. </p><p>
    
    ""Water"" is a spacious masterpiece of quietly seething atmosphere, as Farina intones, ""I want to take you
    to dinner but you'd rather hang out in rest stops/ Engaging in discourse better scratched into desktops,""
    over minimal percussion and a liquid arpeggio.  The staccato, uptempo swing of ""The State I'm In, a.k.a.
    Goode Buy from Cobbs Creek Park"" is a boisterous lament of working class struggles.  And ""Cacophony""-- one
    of two songs that features supplementary guitar from Codeine's Chris Brokaw-- unfurls woozy, meandering
    melodies over martial drumming in a procession of grand crests and expanses of arid ambiance. </p><p>
    
    By all rights, Karate-- 10 years and six albums into their career-- should be recording limp rehashes of
    old material by now.  But the most striking thing about <em>Pockets</em> is how fresh and vital it sounds.
    <em>Pockets</em> is a lens through which Farina flows pure and unfettered, focused into one puissant beam.
    No longer the artist who dabbles, his production is enriched and amplified by the harmonization of all the
    false starts, fragmentary ideas, and assimilated styles that he's amassed in his pursuit of transcendence. </p></div>"|4387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4387-pockets/|8.2|Brian Howe

Stevie Moore was born in Nashville, January 1952, the son of former Elvis bassist Bob Moore.  Beginning
    in the mid-1970s, he began releasing albums and cassettes, and since has amassed more than 400 separate
    full-length albums.  That's right: <i>400</i>.  So why haven't you heard this guy?  First of all, other
    than a few scattered indie label releases, most of his material has been self-released via mail order (now
    via <a href=""http://www.rsteviemoore.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>rsteviemoore.com</u></a>).  Early records such as 1976's
    <i>Phonography</i> and 1977's <i>Swing and a Miss</i> defined his aesthetic: a mixture of Anglo-powered
    pop, Zappa-esque instrumentals, lo-fi experimental sound design, and other music that defies categorization.
    Amazingly, although the nature of his music varies considerably from song to song, his albums are consistently
    interesting; if you like one, there's a very good chance you'll like many.</p><p>
<i>Conscientious Objector</i> was released in June, and is described by Moore as ""works in progress.""  Don't
    let that fool you: Its songs are no less ""finished"" than hundreds of others in his canon-- they're merely
    waiting on a final destination (either in a different mix or another record).  The sound is generally unpolished,
    despite the best efforts of his collaborators, but certainly not to the detriment of the experience.  Fans
    of Daniel Johnson should find much to love about Moore's sound, but beyond that, lovers of eccentric pop--
    from the school of Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks, XTC, Animal Collective, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Bob Drake--
    have a goldmine in this double album.</p><p>
    
    The range of music on <i>Conscientious Objector</i> is staggering, from Moore's ""cover"" of the 1956 exotica
    tune ""Monitor"" to the gentle, guitar and vocal showcase ""Take Back"" to the trippy drum 'n' bass of ""Yung &amp;
    Moore Show (Theme 1)"" to the lazy alt-country of ""Social Studies Buddies"" to the hi-speed, dreamy IDM of
    ""Name Tag the Entertainer Take 12"" to the bizarre collaboration with Paw Tracks' Ariel Pink on ""What Else
    Am I Not Supposed to Do?"" to the Tom Waits-ish reading of ""Hot Cakes and Sausage"" to the breezy electro-bossa
    on ""Divorce Court"" to a Bell Labs text-to-speech reading of all of his song titles on ""A to Z"" to the
    freak-folkish lament ""Big Ben (Bridge Collapse Kills 300 Toddlers) by Spandek"" to the bizarre, hazy cover
    of 2 Live Crew's ""Me So Horny"" to his a cappella ""Swans"" to the synthesizer explosion of ""Judson Fountain
    of Wayne Wayne"".  And that's just the first disc!</p><p>
    
    Moore certainly gets a little help from his friends.  In addition to collaborators Ariel Pink, Terry Burrows
    (aka Yukio Yung), and Don Campau, he also works with XTC's Andy Partridge on ""Bang You're Alive"" and former
    XTC guitarist Dave Gregory, who contributes two birthday-themed greetings, ""Gregorian RSM52"" and ""Gregorian
    KO40"" (named for Moore and his longtime partner Krys O).  Furthermore, he uses vocals tracks from the Electric
    Six to construct ""Gabe R."" and gets assistance from Bell Labs to make minimalist vocal mantra on ""Discodiscodiscodisco""--
    only to follow it up with his own monologue, ""Disco Freaks"", wherein he blames the end of the world on dance
    music and complains that ""you don't make me ice cubes quick enough.""</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, The Breetles' Chris Breetveld co-writes ""(My Baby's Got A) Bank Account"", a concise slice of
    Anglophile power-pop, and Burrows contributes to many tracks that Moore maintains will be heard in ""superior
    alternate"" mixes on a forthcoming album, <i>The Yung &amp; Moore Show</i>.  And then there's old Walt Gollender,
    who unknowingly contributes to the set's funniest ""pieces,"" the two-parted ""Walt Gollender's Breath"".</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, the spirit of <i>Conscientious Objector</i> is pure Moore.  ""Schwann Catalog"" (named after the
    famous classical music mail-order catalog) features a backing track by Burrows but lyrics and vocals by Moore.
    His falsetto is deep-- not the sound of an old man trying to sound younger or softer, but a sensitive, humble
    one sounding knowingly vulnerable.  Burrows reworks his ""I Go into Your Mind"" (originally from Moore's
    cult-classic 1978 LP <i>Delicate Tension</i>) into dreamy, trip-pop, featuring Krys O's graceful, weathered
    vocals.  The song, like much of Moore's work, is born from a mind obviously reared on many strands of popular
    music, yet so attuned to its maker's idiosyncrasies as to seem detached from any song that had ever been.
    Even when he applies himself to relatively mundane numbers like the Beatlesque ""Down"" or the dubious doo-wop
    of ""Wonder Where"", the end result is less piss-take than insular diversion.  And they're never less than
    interesting.</p><p>
    
    Of course, over the course of 51 tracks there's bound to be some filler.  But then, given Moore's sizable
    discography, one shouldn't expect anything close to a perfect track record.  Ultimately, the breadth of
    expression and creativity is enough for me to recommend <i>Conscientious Objector</i> on principle alone,
    and since there are so many truly good songs in the lot, it becomes a simple decision.  R. Stevie Moore may
    well be the most talented, interesting pop musician never to have released a record on a major label, and
    this album is as much a testament to him as any.</p></div>"|5609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5609-conscientious-objector/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    contenders in the post-punk revival championships.  When vocalist/guitarist Ian Worang lost his techno-savant
    partner Jake Fairley to Cologne, he assembled a trad four-piece using friends from the Canadian music scene.
    As a result, Worang moved away from the computer-base of the band's origins and embraced the jagged guitars
    and floating withdrawal of post-punk.</p><p>
    
    This refashioned quartet more than makes up for its losses on its debut, <i>Those Who Were Hung Hang Here</i>.
    Combining dieseled guitar lines with Worang's gauze-covered vocals, the band's forceful sound and savoir-faire
    carve nuances into a genre that by now has little room for invention.  The splintered guitar lines and sang-froid
    drums of ""Understanding the New Violence""-- originally released as a club single in the Worang/Fairley days--
    flirt with the innovation/revival dichotomy.  An insurgent bassline is laid over Worang's whispered vocals,
    thickening the mix to murky, unfathomable depths before the song finally comes to terms with its unaligned
    angst and gives in to clamorous rebirth, searing itself into the album's icier moments.  On ""Buried with Friends"",
    Worang spits sweet nothings with the detached declasse of the urban pedagogue.  But this ain't your diag drunkard's
    diatribe: There's a quiet disgust to Worang's intellect-- he'd rather moan than shout.</p><p>
    
    Against black-eyed guitars and hazy post-punk dimness, Worang's vocals encircle you as though they were piped
    in from an all-night cafe, and it's this Interpol-like sound that the naysayers will surely seize upon when
    writing them off.  Unfortunately, the band's few missteps have nothing to do with their likeness to the
    atmospheric NYC rockers.  Rather, most of the blame falls on the ideas left over from Fairley's days: Seven
    of this record's 11 tracks prominently display his influence, which doesn't mesh well with Uncut's revamped
    sound.</p><p>
    
    ""Copilot"", for example, begins with wheezy synthesizers and a plodding beat, while ""A Summer Day"" sputters
    atop a techno twitch that could have come from a previous recording session.  In these schizophrenic moments,
    Worang seems to be trying to both remain true to the origins of these songs and reconfigure them to work
    best within the dynamics of his now four-piece band.  It doesn't always work, but when it does <i>Those
    Who Were Hung Hang Here</i> reminds us that it's still possible to create thrilling music on those old
    dog-eared vinyl copies of <i>Closer</i>.</p></div>"|8384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8384-those-who-were-hung-hang-here/|7.7|Derek Miller

    to open one's fanbase by embracing the kiddies' heroes and icons-- or at least their flavors of the month.
    On <i>City</i>, the newest release by those Orwellian sirens in Client (i.e. Client A and Client B), Kate
    Holmes (aka Client B) has called in a favor from hubby Alan McGee's clients The Libertines.  Given the boys'
    tumultuous year, it's a blogworthy move-- there aren't many more sure-fire e-conversation starters than
    needle-pricks and broken crack pipes.</p><p>
    Fortunately, it's not a bust: Barât and Doherty's garage-punk leanings nicely offset Client's chilly
    electro-pop soundscapes.  Barât's limp Brit drawl works particularly well against the charging dance-groove
    in ""Pornography"".  His detached vocals recall The Human League's Philip Oakey or Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan
    (whose former bandmate, Andy Fletcher, signed Client to his Toast Hawaii imprint), and mesh well with the
    impassioned rants of Client A, ex-Dubstar singer Sarah Blackwood.  Doherty, though, is another story.
    Given very little to work with on the beat-to-death-titled ""Down to the Underground"", his ale-rough vocal
    coughs against a gurgling electronic beat and seems force-fed, as though there were little room left for
    him but the studio was already booked.</p><p>
    Client unsurprisingly perfects their insurgent dance ministry when the boys have gone, and it's in the cool
    flirtation under their over-the-shoulder glances that the album leaves its mark.  ""Overdrive"" is a volatile
    love swoon that spills across its reverberated beat like a chipped marble on uneven glass.  Full of girth,
    dirt, and static-grime, the song tracks the dark, forlorn nature of post-bar lust, and begs you to watch as
    it flaunts its wares.</p><p>
    In direct juxtaposition to ""Overdrive""'s caustic groove, ""One Day at a Time"" plays the Debbie Gibson to the
    former's Grace Jones.  While some partners would wait for you to drown in sleep and then pick through your
    wallet for your gas card, Client here matronly pulls the covers up to your chin but still makes sure your
    toes are covered.  Atop floating synths and a starry-eyed beat, its endearing charity contrasts pleasantly
    with <i>City</i>'s general hedonism, giving the record a much-needed breather.</p><p>
    Still, as the album closes with another dawn-colored stomp, you can't help but feel deja vu.  Fans of Client
    will appreciate the more dynamic edge to <i>City</i>-- like the syrupy synthetic strings on ""The Chill of
    October""-- but those without a history with the band may write it off as another limp post-electroclash
    exercise.  As for The Libertines... well, it's a sign that these kids are still just barely alright.</p></div>"|1732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1732-city/|5.9|Derek Miller

    deeds contrast with our declared pious objectives.  But moderation has never been Cave's strength, so when
    he opens fire with the immoderate double barrels of <i>Abattoir Blues</i> and <i>The Lyre of Orpheus</i>,
    it appears that he intends to fight audacity with audacity.</p><p>
    
    For the occasion, Saint Nick has again donned his <i>Boatman's Call</i> preacher darks.  You can almost
    taste the brimstone puffing from his nostrils on <i>Abattoir Blues</i>'s opener ""Get Ready for Love"",
    which-- in its full-throated gospel-punk regalia-- sounds like it could be the most raucous Blues Explosion
    track ever.  This unruly blast sets the stage for The Bad Seeds' most varied and dynamic collection in
    years, an ironic fact considering that this is their first album since the departure of designated avant
    guardian Blixa Bargeld.</p><p>
    
    I'm not sure when it was decided that double albums now require two titles (is this Outkast's fault?) but
    the record imprecisely splits its quiet half (<i>Orpheus</i>) from the disorderly half (<i>Abattoir</i>),
    with only a couple of strays crossing the border in each direction. Compared to previous Nick Cave efforts,
    its most prominent new feature is the risky inclusion of a backing gospel choir on several numbers, a
    maneuver so hackneyed that even U2 has largely abandoned it.  But on tracks such as ""Hiding All Away"" the
    extra voices manage to dovetail nicely with The Bad Seeds' more theatrical, over-the-top tendencies-- only
    the most devoutly secular will find cause to object.</p><p>
    
    Throughout his career, Cave has avoided overt political and social commentary, and on the surface, that
    remains the case here, with the bulk of <i>Abattoir/Orpheus</i> ostensibly consisting of love songs directed
    to God, nature, or some other nameless ""she"" or ""babe.""  But it'd be pretty difficult not to notice the
    panicked, apocalyptic subtext that veins through tracks like ""Cannibal's Hymn"" or ""Messiah Ward"".  ""Do you
    feel what I feel, dear?/ Mass extinction, darling, hypocrisy/ These things are not good for me,"" Cave sings
    on ""Abattoir Blues"", a song which attempts to inject some humor into Armageddon.  ""The sky is on fire, the
    dead are heaped across the land/ I went to bed last night and my moral code got jammed/ I woke up this
    morning with a Frappucino in my hand.""</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Cave struggles to decide whether the arts should be merely an entertaining distraction for an
    audience or if the artist has a responsibility to direct our focus on society's ills.  On ""Nature Boy"",
    the singer gets advice from his father after watching a gory news report: ""Don't look away now.../ In the
    end it is beauty/ That is going to save the world.""  And on the writer's block lament ""There She Goes, My
    Beautiful World"", he notes the link between creativity and the ability to endure and stand witness to
    hardship.  ""John Wilmot, penned his poetry riddled with the pox.../ St. John of the Cross did his best
    stuff imprisoned in a box/ And Johnny Thunders was half alive when he wrote 'Chinese Rocks'.""</p><p>
    
    But Cave also creates escapist music, singing extensively of linden trees and cornflowers, red-breasted
    robins, and gamboling lambs.  And it sure seems as though he slams the door on the notion of art saving
    the world on <i>The Lyre of Orpheus</i>'s title track. In Cave's sardonic, tedious rewrite of the Greek
    myth, the music created by Orpheus' instrument spreads across the Earth like a murderous pestilence until
    God gets pissed and throws him down into hell where Eurydice threatens to shove the lyre up Orpheus'
    ""orifice.""  (Unfortunately, this song sounds no better than it looks on paper.)</p><p>

    songs that fail manage to do so dramatically rather than boringly.  If you're able to hunker down and
    dodge the occasional duds, you're rewarded at the finish line with ""O Children"", a straight-faced, full
    chorus number that somehow overcomes every inspirational music cliche (including a lyrical references to
    ""Amazing Grace"") to become genuinely beautiful and stirring.  It may even leave you with a brief but
    powerful feeling that piety may yet someday overcome depravity.</p></div>"|11700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11700-abattoir-bluesthe-lyre-of-orpheus/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

    deeds contrast with our declared pious objectives.  But moderation has never been Cave's strength, so when
    he opens fire with the immoderate double barrels of <i>Abattoir Blues</i> and <i>The Lyre of Orpheus</i>,
    it appears that he intends to fight audacity with audacity.</p><p>
    
    For the occasion, Saint Nick has again donned his <i>Boatman's Call</i> preacher darks.  You can almost
    taste the brimstone puffing from his nostrils on <i>Abattoir Blues</i>'s opener ""Get Ready for Love"",
    which-- in its full-throated gospel-punk regalia-- sounds like it could be the most raucous Blues Explosion
    track ever.  This unruly blast sets the stage for The Bad Seeds' most varied and dynamic collection in
    years, an ironic fact considering that this is their first album since the departure of designated avant
    guardian Blixa Bargeld.</p><p>
    
    I'm not sure when it was decided that double albums now require two titles (is this Outkast's fault?) but
    the record imprecisely splits its quiet half (<i>Orpheus</i>) from the disorderly half (<i>Abattoir</i>),
    with only a couple of strays crossing the border in each direction. Compared to previous Nick Cave efforts,
    its most prominent new feature is the risky inclusion of a backing gospel choir on several numbers, a
    maneuver so hackneyed that even U2 has largely abandoned it.  But on tracks such as ""Hiding All Away"" the
    extra voices manage to dovetail nicely with The Bad Seeds' more theatrical, over-the-top tendencies-- only
    the most devoutly secular will find cause to object.</p><p>
    
    Throughout his career, Cave has avoided overt political and social commentary, and on the surface, that
    remains the case here, with the bulk of <i>Abattoir/Orpheus</i> ostensibly consisting of love songs directed
    to God, nature, or some other nameless ""she"" or ""babe.""  But it'd be pretty difficult not to notice the
    panicked, apocalyptic subtext that veins through tracks like ""Cannibal's Hymn"" or ""Messiah Ward"".  ""Do you
    feel what I feel, dear?/ Mass extinction, darling, hypocrisy/ These things are not good for me,"" Cave sings
    on ""Abattoir Blues"", a song which attempts to inject some humor into Armageddon.  ""The sky is on fire, the
    dead are heaped across the land/ I went to bed last night and my moral code got jammed/ I woke up this
    morning with a Frappucino in my hand.""</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Cave struggles to decide whether the arts should be merely an entertaining distraction for an
    audience or if the artist has a responsibility to direct our focus on society's ills.  On ""Nature Boy"",
    the singer gets advice from his father after watching a gory news report: ""Don't look away now.../ In the

    of style, and Fatboy Slim was gatecrashing happy hours, dormitories, and the P.A. systems of sporting events
    with the sculpted trash energy of singles like ""The Rockafeller Skank"" and ""Praise You"".  But the sound's
    blaring populism quickly seemed tiresome, and by the turn of the millennium its whip-crack breakbeats and
    whooping bottom end had been sold for scrap to Rockstar Games and street luge enthusiasts.</p><p>
    
    The Brothers and the Boy, Norman Cook, survived the fire sale, returning in the 2000s with less obvious
    albums that recaptured some of their dance community cred.  But unfortunately, many U.S. college kids were
    still clamoring for catchy new skanks to bump chests and wet tees to.  With 2000's <i>Halfway Between the
    Gutter and the Stars</i>, Fatboy attempted to make trance crash with some trademark Slim fervor.  But while
    it lessened the buffoonery, the record still ticked with guest shots (R&amp;B; mercenary Macy Gray), and Christopher
    Walken danced the smirking loops of ""Weapon of Choice"" into gimmicky replay on the brains of millions.  Fatboy
    Slim seemed stuck in the loop that made him popular in the first place.</p><p>
    
    Cook's response is <i>Palookaville</i>, which is precision-built for a polarized and perhaps even less
    responsive 2004.  Perhaps realizing dance music's irrelevance to Americans outside of Fat Joe joints on
    the broad side, and the house, techno, and IDM heads in the underground minority-- <i>and</i> realizing
    that the bombast as we knew it in the 90s still echoes in Spike TV promos and shaving cream spots with
    sick production values-- Cook has returned the Fatboy Slim brand to market.  Here, he's backed more by
    rock than the burble of the 808, but Slim still loves blabbing repetition and dropping yapping vocal
    samples into the gobs of the dull, and this helps make <i>Palookaville</i> less a reformation than merely
    his latest and quite bland big beat manifesto.</p><p>
    
    The album begins with two of its weakest tracks, ""Don't Let the Man Get You Down"" and ""Slash Dot Dash"".
    It's fine for ""Man"" to cut the defining phrase from the Five Man Electrical Band's ""Signs"" (""Long-haired
    freaky people need not apply!"") over piano breaks and wiggy percussion-- it's possibly both a rallying cry
    for a new age of freaks or a snide comment on censorship.  But where's the rest of the song?  It drifts
    into squiggling Fatboy Slim generica, sapping whatever power might've been left in the vocal hook.  And
    ""Slash Dot Dash""?  It's as empty as the vacuum after the dot-com bust, a tinfoil crumple of store-bought
    spy guitar and a vocal sample that needles three times sharper than the funk soul brother.</p><p>
    
    But while <i>Palookaville</i> gets off to an unquestionably cauliflower-ear start, it does feature some
    punchy amalgams of rock and electronic elements towards its center, and some of the live instrumentation
    that Cook has touted as part of his new routine eventually begins to make an impression.  Latyrx's Lateef
    busts an admittedly toned-down version of his malleable, inventive flow over the concise rhythms of
    ""Wonderful Night"", and also lights up the weedy canter of ""The Journey"".  Damon Albarn continues his
    quirky collaborator streak with the tinkling, hazy ""Put It Back Together"", on which his slurring soul
    croon leads sunny backup singers in an oddball Caribbean lilt that's fueled by funk breaks and assorted
    Fatboy Slim noise that actually works.  ""North West Three"" is also solid, and although most people listening
    to Fatboy Slim aren't hoping to conjure memories of <i>Love Story</i>, it could double as the theme to an
    autumnal love affair.</p><p>
    
    Still, despite its handful of strong moments, <i>Palookaville</i> can't shake its widescreen, broadly
    accessible feel: <i>Dance Music for Dummies</i>, maybe?  ""Song for Chesh"" feels assembled from leftover
    cuts and samples; ""Jin Go Lo Ba"" returns to the blatant NBA highlight film baiting of ""Slash Dot Dash"".
    Drop that beat and let the tomahawk dunk montage begin.  And if that's not tiresome enough, Cook also
    taps his old pal Bootsy Collins for a shit-eating tear through Steve Miller Band's ""The Joker"" that's at
    least as sugary as Uncle Kracker and Dobie Gray's tepid remake of ""Drift Away"".  A shizzle here or a
    fizzle there does not make a tired sound fresh.  <i>Palookaville</i> avoids booming with tired, late-90s
    big beat fever, but it's never far away from that genre's vacancy, since it aims so squarely for the same
    old middle of the road.</p></div>"|3011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3011-palookaville/|4.6|Johnny Loftus

    pop backlash.  In the meantime, here's <em>In the Alleyway</em>, the full-length debut by New Orleans duo
    Hercules.  Though this record shares its whirling melodies and kaleidoscopic arrangements with the rest
    of today's Brian Wilson adherents, its most striking aspect is its minimalism.  Instead of the emulating
    the kitchen-sink quality of The Flaming Lips or Head of Femur, Hercules have a quiet, restrained brilliance:
    a ""Ruby Tuesday"" drum fill here, glissanding ""Four Seasons"" strings there, and big Bacharach tunefulness
    all over the damn place.</p><p>
    
    Hercules are songwriting and production team Peter Baldwin and Ben Sumner, who previously played everything
    but the didgeridoo for local neo-psych group Bipolaroid.  The pair has also recorded a Christmas record, a
    covers record, scored some films, and did some undisclosed work with Lullaby Baxter.  Its members are
    instrumentalists, but Fan Modine's Gordon Zacharias provides elegant, restrained vocals on seven of
    <em>In the Alleyway</em>'s 11 tracks, and his high, innocent delivery and touch of Morrissey-esque melodrama
    makes compelling art of their unadorned lyrics, which cover the usual indie pop touchstones: lost love,
    disillusionment, and all manner of bad weather.  The blithely grief-stricken ""Good for You"" provides the
    album's lyrical high point, as Zacharias hides his tears like Smokey Robinson or the aforementioned Moz
    behind swooning orchestration.</p><p>
    
    Much of the album leans heavily on classic mid-60s pop.  Opener ""Something's Been Missing from My Life""
    starts with a stab of organs so familiar you half-expect a voice chime in and say, ""I/ I love the colorful
    clothes she wears.""  Languid acoustic guitars and squiggly electrics are often panned all the way to either
    side of the mix.  And the strings are inevitably Spectoresque, particularly when they seize the foreground
    on peppy instrumental ""Let's Go Out"".</p><p>
    
    Despite the 1960s fetish, Hercules are at their best when they incorporate more modern elements into their
    sound.  For example, after bouncy <em>Revolver</em>-style horns leaven the simple melancholia of ""Don't Cry"",
    fuzzed-out shoegaze guitars arrive for an elegantly dissonant plane crash of a coda.  The strings on the
    leisurely ""Hurricane"" may fit for teatime on a summer's day, but they sit atop both peaceful acoustic
    guitars and painterly feedback and swirling noise.</p><p>
    
    The shoegaze influence amounts only to occasional squalls amid the album's endless summer, but it points
    toward an inspiring new direction for smart, orchestral pop.  Quick: Enjoy it, before the snobby contrarian
    in the next cubicle calls you a square.</p></div>"|3992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3992-in-the-alleyway/|8.2|Marc Hogan

    misspelling of his own first name underscores his immaturity.</p><p>
    
    The Vermont native's debut album, <i>Handwriting</i>, sounds as if it lingers underneath a lone, orange
    phosphorescent streetlight in the vacant lot outside a gated, suburban community.  Kirby-Long maintains
    a sense of poetic distance with processed-guitar symphonics that dissolve into the ether like blood rushing
    into freshly noise-damaged ears.  While listening to the record, Fennesz immediately come to mind--
    especially on the album closer, ""Tattletalent [Encore]"", whose hymnal guitar shutters seem sampled from
    the Austrian maestro's <i>Live in Japan</i>.  However, Kirby-Long domesticates this otherwise raw and
    deeply impressionistic sound, turning it into something more lyrical, coherent, and reminiscent of shoegaze.
    Faithful to the shoegaze tradition, Kirby-Long's mutterings are often incomprehensible and evoke emotions
    that cannot be adequately described by the English vocabulary.</p><p>
    
    Yet, if the digital paint was removed and the song's sketches were intact, <i>Handwriting</i> would be
    little more than conventional looped guitar melodies set to an auto-piloted, drum machine beat.  In other
    words, the album's ""folktronic"" elements are ornaments rather than qualities that can walk on their own.
    But the kid still returns with Polaroids of his adolescence and sexual frustrations to tack on his bedroom
    corkboard and lament over-- red-eyed, backstabbing girlfriends and all.</p><p>
    
    Given his age, one can understand Kirby-Long's sense of being promised the world and then realizing he is
    owed nothing.  ""Finally convinced myself that I'm not living,"" croons the poor sod on opener ""Man from the
    Anthill"", on which he bathes his yearning in amniotic static and steel guitar.  Kirby-Long prays that he'll
    stroll through the garden by Jesus' hand, but is still waiting for an answer after ""14 hours... and 61 bus
    stops.""  He then mires the good Lord's response into a din of scrambled FM-broadcast voices, all of them
    speaking in tongues.</p><p>
    
    ""Daylight and Delight""'s familiar indie rock guitar riff drives across a dirt road in a slight, heat-stroked
    daze.  Kirby-Long finds shade in a vivid orchestration of ringing guitar drones and sauntering piano melodies
    that mold into a fine trance just before the song's unfortunate fade-out.  ""Dusty"" uses the same palette:
    It's a sleepwalking Pavement-style ballad colored in spots by Fennesz-esque hits of static disruption and
    a great faded guitar that struggles as it gasps for air.  Less successful are ""Megans Present"", which uneasily
    balances Kirby-Long's croon between a wavering female voice and a schmaltzy new age synthline, and the poorly
    mixed guitar warbles of ""The Stoned Night"".</p><p>
    
    The album's centerpiece, ""An Ape Is Loose"", has a mournful yet optimistic guitar hook that could be looped
    for an hour and still sound alive.  It's a pity that this glorious moment only lasts for half of the tune,
    and it's also an example of why Kirby-Long needs to have patience with his best ideas.  And if he also opened
    his mouth a bit wider and dialed his vocal radio to a cleaner signal, we might even pick up some profound
    verses.</p></div>"|4584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4584-handwriting/|7.7|Cameron Macdonald
